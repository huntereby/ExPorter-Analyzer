Administrative Core
Core Leads: Nevan Krogan and Trey Ideker
SUMMARY
The mission of the Administrative Core is to promote the scientific and outreach goals of the Cancer Cell Map
Initiative (CCMI) v2.0 and to connect the CCMI to the broader cancer systems biology community and the NCI.
Amongst its responsibilities the Core will perform the following: serve as the primary contact for all internal
logistical and organizational aspects of the CCMI; serve as the primary contact for external interactions with
other centers in the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC), the NCI, and the cancer research community;
implement strategies to enhance diversity and inclusion in cancer systems biology; manage the solicitation,
review, and funding of Research Center pilot projects; and ensure timely sharing of data and resources produced
by all Research Center Projects and Cores through the U24 Coordinating Center and NIH/NCI resources. Day-
to-day activities will be coordinated by a cross-campus team consisting of the Co-Directors, Assistant Director,
Research Center Administrators and Data Managers. The Core will organize a Steering Committee to evaluate
the progress and needs of each CCMI component, review and possibly modify priorities, and identify areas
deserving of extra focus. To facilitate communication amongst Center members, the Core will organize a variety
of regularly scheduled meetings, some specifically for members of the Steering Committee and others for the
entire CCMI. The Core will also facilitate communication with the CSBC and NCI, especially around key events
such as the CSBC Annual Meeting, the Junior Investigators’ Meeting and the various CSBC Working Groups.
To enhance diversity and inclusion in cancer systems biology, the Core will ensure that opportunities are
provided to a diverse set of researchers, whether that opportunity is to present at a CCMI-organized event or as
a recipient of CCMI research funds. The Core will also manage the solicitation, review, and funding of pilot
projects of faculty members wishing to develop and apply systems biology approaches to address a compelling
biomedical question in cancer in collaboration with CCMI investigators. Finally, to ensure the timely sharing of
data and resources, we have designated two qualified Data Managers, one in San Francisco with experimental
expertise and one in San Diego with computational expertise, who will interact with the consortium to facilitate
the timely sharing of interoperable datasets and community accessible resources. In addition, the CCMI web
portal will be maintained as a collaborative effort among the Administrative Core, Outreach Core and
Software Infrastructure for Network Models and Cell Maps Core (Core 2). It provides researchers with a
central access point for CCMI networks and cell maps; custom websites in support of CCMI publications;
and a catalog of software tools, tutorials and links to documentation."

Project 1: Systematic physical and spatial mapping of driver networks in cancer
Project Leads: Nevan Krogan and Emma Lundberg; Co-Investigators: Alan Ashworth, Jean-Philippe Coppe,
Jennifer Grandis, Silvio Gutkind, Natalia Jura and Laura van ’t Veer
SUMMARY
Tumors display complex mutational profiles that appear as a random pattern of mutations in genetic studies.
However, it is their non-random combination and convergence on cancer pathways that lead to transformation.
Specific pathways such as the PI3K or p53 axis are recurrently mutated in a majority of cancers but besides
such pan-cancer mutated pathways, each tumor harbors 20 to over 1,000 additional mutations that are rarely
seen across the patient population. Tumor heterogeneity, tissue of origin, and degree of progression give each
case a unique subset of altered pathways and has hampered the development of targeted cancer therapies.
Mapping genetic mutations onto previously identified cellular pathways can provide insights for clinical
characterization. To efficiently leverage pathway networks for therapeutic strategies, in Project 1 we will identify
and characterize cancer driver pathways.
To this end, we will combine physical and spatial protein interactions with large scale genomic data and apply a
suite of proteomic technologies with in vitro imaging through cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to
systematically map protein networks in an orthogonal (cancer specific) or transversal (across cancers) manner.
Specifically, we will systematically identify the network of key regulators of the PI3K pathway and p53 across
breast (BRCA), head and neck (HNSCC) and lung squamous cancers (LUSC), and complement our previous
work on HNSCC and BRCA by identifying driver networks in LUSC. Guided by proteomic approaches coupled
with sophisticated imaging and high-resolution structural analysis of key complexes with functional validation,
Project 1 will gain insights into the underlying molecular biology of these cancers and unravel genetic
vulnerabilities of therapeutic relevance. In Aim 1, we will map the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of 30
proteins (and 12 mutants in 6 of those proteins) of the PI3K pathway and 10 mutants of p53 across HNSCC,
BRCA and LUSC. We will also define the physical interactions of the 30 most recurrently altered proteins (and
20 associated mutants in 9 of the proteins) in LUSC, complementing our previous work on HNSCC and BRCA.
Using the Human Protein Atlas resource of antibodies, Aim 2 will focus on macroscopic mapping of the spatial
subcellular organization of key oncogenic drivers and their interactors defined in Aim 1. Aim 3 will exploit recent
advances in cryo-EM to structurally characterize key complexes, including those in the PI3K pathway. Finally,
predictions from the previous aims will be tested in Aim 4 in cell lines, primary cells and mouse models and with
clinical data."
10911940,"Project 2: Summary/Abstract
The rarity of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) has made detailed study of its genetic epidemiology difficult. LMS occurs
with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), a hereditary cancer syndrome due to germline TP53 pathogenic variants
(PVs), and LMS also occurs with Retinoblastoma, another hereditary cancer syndrome due to germline RB1
PVs. Recent limited studies of patients with LMS have revealed additional germline mutations in the DNA
damage response (DDR) pathway, the same pathway known to play a somatic role in LMS tumorigenesis.
However, the majority of familial risk in LMS remains unexplained and a diagnosis of LMS by itself does not
currently trigger clinical genetic testing or risk assessment. This project assembles the largest series of LMS
patients to date to perform a definitive and comprehensive genetic epidemiology survey. We will identify and
explore a range of potential cancer predisposition genes to more fully characterize the genetic risk, including a
detailed analysis of germline TP53 variants, the most commonly mutated gene in LMS. In Aim 1, we will utilize
the Utah Population Database (UPDB) and the International Sarcoma Kindred Study (ISKS) to better define the
risk for cancer in family members of LMS patients. We will interrogate these two large population-based and
international sarcoma-based resources to explore cancer-specific patterns in LMS probands and their families
to look for associations with LFS and other cancer predisposition syndromes. In Aim 2, we will access germline
DNA on 700 cases of LMS for the largest whole genome sequencing analysis of LMS to date, utilizing the ISKS
as well as cases from clinical trials as part of this SPORE. This study will create a definitive map of currently
known cancer predisposition genes and also use novel statistical methods to identify novel genes and pathways
associated with LMS. In a pilot psychosocial study, attitudes of LMS patients across the globe will be assessed
about germline genomics and return of genetic information. In LMS patients found to carry a pathogenic variant
(PV) in a cancer predisposition gene, we will explore psychosocial outcomes along with communication and
uptake of testing among at-risk relatives. In Aim 3, we will analyze the TP53 genotype:phenotype correlations in
LFS families with LMS through combined international LFS registries with clinical genetic testing data available,
in part seeking to quantify LMS risk and to identify genetic factors in TP53 affecting that risk. At the completion
of Project 2, we will have assembled and analyzed some of the largest collections of LMS patients in general
(up to 800 individuals) as well as carefully interrogated LMS patients with identified genetic cancer predisposition,
including their attitudes toward genetic testing. The combined strength of our investigative team in cancer
genetics, from population scientists to clinical cancer geneticists, will help us to greatly expand our understanding
of the genetic risks for LMS."

Project 2: Functional Genetic Networks for Systems-Guided Precision Medicine
Project Leads: Prashant Mali and Stephanie Fraley; Co-Investigators: Alan Ashworth, Jennifer Grandis,
Silvio Gutkind, Trey Ideker, and Laura van ’t Veer.
SUMMARY
Precision medicine aims to tailor therapies to the genetic and molecular background of a patient’s tumor. The
development of such therapies faces numerous obstacles, many deriving from our ignorance of the genetic
networks underlying tumorigenesis and the mechanisms of possible interventions. To clarify the genetic logic
that governs therapeutic efficacy, Project 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9 genetic perturbation methodologies in an
ensemble of combinatorial, functional, and mechanistic screens. Screens will focus on the PI3K pathway, the
p53 tumor suppressor, and the protein systems mutated in invasive breast cancer (BRCA), head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), pathways and diseases that
together result in well over one million deaths each year worldwide. This focus will enable us to interrogate a
broad collection of cell lines, experiments, and microenvironmental conditions. First, we will build on significant
preliminary data to establish maps of synthetic lethal and epistatic genetic interactions centered on frequently
mutated genes and therapeutic targets in the above pathways and cancer subtypes (Aim 1). Second, we will
couple CRISPR/Cas9 screening to a panel of scalable functional assays for large-scale measurement of cancer
phenotypes beyond cell proliferation (Aim 2). Third, we will pilot a new technology, STAG-CRISPR, to link
CRISPR/Cas9 screening to real time molecular events in living cells, providing access to an even deeper array
of phenotypes that have been recalcitrant to systems genetics thus far (Aim 3). Finally, to facilitate clinical
translation of the identified gene-gene, gene-phenotype, gene-mechanism and gene-drug interactions, we will
apply our extensive library of BRCA, HNSCC, and LUSC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to test
compelling leads in vivo. We will also validate the identified interaction networks with patient data from the BRCA
I-SPY 2 trial and from HNSCC patients at UCSD (Aim 4). Taken together, our integrated approach establishes
a network of extensively validated interactions among genes, drugs and multiple phenotypic endpoints to
advance the practice of precision oncology."
10912911,"Abstract
Inhibition critically shapes auditory signal processing, impacting nearly every aspect of hearing. In the inferior
colliculus (IC), inhibition shapes how neurons respond to auditory cues that are essential for speech and
vocalization processing, including frequency tuning curves and directional selectivity for frequency modulated
(FM) sweeps. In addition, diminished synaptic inhibition is a critical feature in age-related hearing loss. The IC is
considered the hub of the central auditory pathway, and despite the crucial role of inhibition in the IC, the cellular
mechanisms underlying GABAergic inhibition remain largely unknown. This gap in our understanding exists
because it has been proven difficult to identify distinct GABAergic neuron types in the IC. We recently overcame
this problem by identifying Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression as a marker for a novel class of inhibitory principal
neurons in the IC. NPY neurons are GABAergic, have a stellate morphology and project to the auditory thalamus
(MG). In addition, we found that NPY signaling dampens the excitability of a large family of IC glutamatergic
neurons that express the NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R). In this proposal, I will investigate the mechanisms underlying
NPY signaling in the IC and how the co-release of NPY and GABA affects auditory processing in vivo. The overall
objective of this research is to determine how NPY and GABA signaling from a defined class of IC GABAergic
neurons influence Y1R neurons to shape frequency tuning and FM sweep direction selectivity in the auditory
tectothalamic pathway. I will further determine whether augmenting NPY signaling improves features of auditory
processing in the IC and MG that are disrupted in a mouse model of aging. To pursue these objectives, I will use
in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology, combined with pharmacology, chemogenetics and optogenetics.
Aim 1 will be accomplished during the K99 phase. I will combine in vitro electrophysiology with pharmacology
and optogenetic circuit mapping to determine how GABA and NPY signaling interact to modulate excitability in
the IC.
Aim 2 will be performed during the K99 phase. I will make in vivo recordings in the IC-MG pathway while using
pharmacology, chemogenetics and optogenetics to modulate NPY and GABAergic signaling. This aim will
determine how NPY signaling shapes the tonal receptive fields and FM sweep direction selectivity of neurons in
the IC and MG.
In Aim 3, during the R00 phase, I will combine the skills I have learned during the K99 phase with my background
in electrophysiology and viral tract tracing to investigate how NPY and Y1R neurons interact to shape
postsynaptic activity in the MG. I will further determine how excitatory-inhibitory interactions in this circuit are
affected in a mouse model of aging. This research will provide a mechanistic understanding of how a distinct
subtype of GABAergic neuron interacts with neuropeptide signaling in the IC to shape auditory computations in
the tectothalamic pathway."
10913517,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - MORPHOLOGY AND IMAGING CORE
The Morphology and Imaging Core provides access to expert personnel and specialized equipment for
investigating the anatomy and cell biology of both fixed and live tissues. This Core enhances the research
environment by facilitating the research activities of investigators who use anatomical and imaging techniques.
Because of the technical expertise provided, this Core enables other investigators to add anatomical and
imaging techniques to their repertoire of research tools. This Core is housed in a dedicated suite of rooms
totaling 921 sq. ft. Access and training are provided for instrumentation used in 1) processing ocular tissue for
light and confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ
hybridization, and 2) capturing and processing images from live or fixed tissues. Equipment available in this
Core includes two cryostats, a paraffin processing and embedding station and paraffin microtome, an
ultramicrotome for ultra-thin sectioning for electron microscopy, two research-grade epifluorescence
microscopes, a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, a newly installed Leica Stellaris 8 Confocal Microscopy
System and a Leica laser microdissection microscope. In addition, there are computer workstations dedicated
to image analysis that run a stand-alone version of Leica AF, plus MetaMorph, Imaris and other imaging
software packages.
The Morphology and Imaging Core is staffed by a full-time technician, Mr. Brad Nelson, who processes and
sections fixed tissues, assists users with experimental methods, trains users on the epifluorescence
microscopes and the microscopes’ imaging software. Another key function of the technician is to maintain the
Core’s equipment. A second key staff person, Dr. Steve Lentz (20% effort, paid by the Department of
Ophthalmology), trains users on the confocal microscopes and the advanced features of the Leica AF,
MetaMorph, and Imaris software packages. During the next funding period, it is anticipated that 15
investigators will use this Core to a moderate or extensive degree. During the past 5 years, this Core was
moderately or extensively utilized by 14 investigators."
10913550,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Adolescence is a critical time period for the development of health behaviors such as physical activity and risk
behaviors such as alcohol use. One way adolescents learn about and model their behaviors is via technology
and digital media (TDM), particularly social media. Adolescent behavior can be influenced by content that
adolescents display (self-generated) on social media, as well as content they consume (other-generated). The
long-term goal of this research is to understand mechanisms by which social media influence health and risk
behavior towards the development of interventions to promote healthy behavior and reduce risk behavior. The
objective of this Project 1 is to understand patterns and content of displayed health and risk behavior on social
media that is created by, and consumed by, adolescents. We will determine connections between three key
concepts through our Specific Aims, including: 1) what adolescents display on TDM about their own health and
risk behaviors via self-generated content, 2) the displayed TDM content adolescents are exposed to in real-time
about health and risk behaviors, and 3) adolescents’ self-reported health and risk behavior attitudes, social
norms intentions and actions. Our third aim will assess neural processes underlying how created and consumed
TDM content is processed and associated with health and risk behavior. The PI, Co-I and consultant on this
Project bring over a decade of work in the area of adolescent behaviors displayed on social media, including
several NIH-funded studies in this area. Our preliminary data indicates that for older adolescents, self-generated
risk behavior content on TDM closely aligns with self-reported behavior, and that Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) is feasible to use with adolescent populations to assess real-time TDM use and content
exposure. This study will use a longitudinal study design, collecting data over 2 years. The shared participant
pool for this P01 program will be leveraged to recruit the sample of 400 adolescents aged 13-15 years at
enrollment. Data collection approaches will include social media observation of health and risk behaviors,
including self-generated and other-generated. This social media observational data will be linked to self-report
survey data including attitudes, social norms, intentions and behaviors. Moderators will include technology
importance and parent involvement. Data collection will also include Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
to determine adolescents’ exposure to self-generated and other-generated content across TDM in real-time.
Finally, investigators will utilize social media data during a fMRI scan to determine whether self-generated and
other-generated content is processed differently. This project aligns with the current RFA as utilizes multi-level
assessments of health and development, including real-time measures of TDM exposure."
10913551,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Social connectedness and inclusion are essential for well-being and health, particularly during adolescence, a
period characterized by an increased salience placed on peer relationships and experiences. Technology and
digital media (TDM), particularly social media, has the affordance of connecting with peers. In fact, TDM has
become an increasingly important form of communication for adolescents, 71% of adolescents report using more
than one social media site and 92% of adolescents between the ages of 13-17 years old report going online
daily. Reviews on TDM use, however, suggest that there is not consensus on the impact of TDM and social
media use on well-being and health behaviors among adolescents, finding positive, negative, and null results.
They highlight that little evidence exists that examines potential moderating factors between TDM use and well-
being and health outcomes, which limits our understanding of what influences outcomes of interest. Thus, there
is an urgent need to fill this gap. Effects associated with TDM use may depend on specific ways that adolescents
use TDM. For example, if high levels of exposure to certain kinds of TDM, such as social media, sensitize
adolescents to other people’s opinions, they may be more reactive to negative experiences such as social
exclusion, but may benefit more from experiences of social inclusion. This sensitivity may help explain the mixed
findings within the literature. The current study proposes to test this idea by measuring adolescent’s exposure to
social media (drawing data from Projects 1 and 3) that have the affordances of social connectedness (i.e., likes,
comments, number of friends or followers). Then we will relate these experiences longitudinally to their reactivity
to experiences of social inclusion and exclusion to predict health and risk behaviors as well as well-being
(drawing data from Projects 1 and 3) and examine how changes in functional reactivity across the social transition
period from middle to high school, a period associated with changes in social ties, risk-taking, and challenges to
well-being, may influence these relationships. This data will not only examine deficits associated with social
media use that lead to poorer well-being and unhealthy behaviors, but will also examine the strengths of social
media use and how they relate to better well-being and healthy behaviors. Further, if adolescents are sensitized
to social cues, the data can help identify ways to help steer adolescents towards social media engagement that
leads to greater well-being and healthier behaviors. This project aligns with the current RFA as it tests how TDM
usage affects health behavior. This project specifically aligns with two areas of interest for this RFA: 1)
interdisciplinary studies of TDM usage across adolescence employing multi-level assessments of
neurodevelopment to examine interrelated developmental changes in brain function and complex behavior, and
2) real-time measures of TDM exposure and usage and how this usage regulates adolescents’ behavior."
10913554,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
The development of socioemotional well-being in adolescence is crucial for mental and physical health.
Technology and digital media (TDM), and especially social media, are highly used among adolescents and hold
risks and opportunities for socioemotional well-being. These risks and opportunities may be more pronounced
in sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents. The long-term goal of our research is to promote well-being
for adolescents and young adults by decreasing negative social media activities and amplifying positive social
media activities. The objective of this Project is to understand the types of social media content that adolescents
create (self-generated) and consume (other-generated), and how these social media activities affect
socioemotional well-being. The Aims are: 1) To test bidirectional relationships between self-generated TDM
content and socioemotional well-being; 2) To test bidirectional relationships between other-generated TDM
content and socioemotional well-being; and 3) To compare the self-and other-generated TDM experiences of
sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents with those of non-SGM adolescents. The PI, Co-Is, and
Consultant on this Project bring decades of research experience with adolescents and social media. The PI’s
preliminary work has included development of a novel ethnographic approach to directly observed self-generated
social media content and accumulated experience with longitudinal study design in early adolescents. The
proposed Project will use longitudinal data collection over 2 years. The shared participant pool for this P01
program will be leveraged to recruit the sample of 400 adolescents aged 13-15 years at enrollment. Data
collection approaches included online ethnographic observation of participants’ self-generated social media
content, thematic analysis of other-generated content experienced by participants, individual interviews, and
survey administration. These data will be used to test a cross-lagged panel model examining socioemotional
well-being as a predictor and outcome of self-generated and other-generated social media experiences over
time. Qualitative comparison groups will be used to compare self-and other-generated social media experiences
between SGM and non-SGM adolescents. This Project aligns with the current RFA as it tests how TDM usage
impacts social-emotional development and health outcomes in adolescents from diverse backgrounds and
subpopulations."
10938001,"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Healthcare: Findings have the potential to increase the number of
Veterans who benefit from one of the most effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). In addition to reductions in PTSD symptomology, successful completion
of CPT results in improvement in functional impairment, decreases in comorbid symptoms, and enhanced
quality of life. This project tackles an important question for our colleagues within the Office of Mental Health
and Suicide Prevention, who have expressed a need for strategies that enable flexibility while maintaining
fidelity to the demonstrably efficacious CPT protocol. This proposal addresses RR&D’s priority area of
conducting research on cognitive behavioral therapy for Veterans with psychological health conditions.
Project Background: CPT has been widely disseminated throughout VHA with over 4000 VHA providers
certified to provide CPT through the Mental Health Dissemination Initiative to date. However, as CPT has been
implemented several factors have limited its impact on Veterans’ health. Veteran engagement in CPT is
suboptimal, outcomes achieved in Veteran populations are more modest than those obtained with civilians,
and improvements in functioning and quality of life are more modest than those observed in the core
symptoms of PTSD. Strategies for improving patient engagement, enhancing treatment outcomes, and
expanding the success of the intervention to functional impairments are needed for Veterans to fully benefit
from the CPT dissemination initiative. Expanding and enhancing the CPT protocol is a promising strategy for
achieving these goals. Integrating a case formulation (CF) approach into the existing CPT protocol may enable
providers to increase treatment flexibility while maintaining fidelity to effective CPT principles. CF is a
collaborative process between providers and patients that enables providers to tailor cognitive-behavioral
treatments to specific clients’ needs within clear parameters of what justifies deviation from the standard
protocol. Our study team has preliminarily demonstrated that CF-integrated CPT (CF-CPT) yields lower levels
of dropout and a higher proportion of patients losing their PTSD diagnoses than published accounts of CPT.
Project Objectives: Our long-term objective is to build on the success of the CPT Dissemination Initiative on
Veterans’ health by directly targeting functional impairments and enhancing patient outcomes. We propose the
following aims: 1) Compare the relative effectiveness of CF-CPT to CPT in improving Veterans’ psychosocial
functioning quality of life and well-being as well as core PTSD and depression symptoms; 2.) Determine the
effectiveness of CF-CPT as compared to CPT in improving Veterans’ treatment engagement; 3.) Evaluate CF-
CPT’s indirect impact on Veterans’ psychosocial functioning, quality of life, well-being and PTSD/depression as
influenced by improvement in the idiosyncratic clinical challenges targeted by the CF.
Project Methods: We are proposing a randomized control trial in which a national sample of up to 56 CPT-
certified providers will be randomized to administer either CPT or CF-CPT. Each provider will deliver their
assigned version of CPT to four Veterans presenting for treatment in their clinic. Data sources will include pre-
and posttreatment diagnostic interviews, Veteran self-report surveys; administrative data extracted from mental
health progress notes; and therapy process data including daily symptom monitoring diaries (Aim 3. Our
primary Aim 1 outcomes will be standardized measures of functioning, quality of life, and well-being; secondary
Aim 1 outcomes include clinician-assessed PTSD symptomology and comorbid mental health symptoms (e.g.
depression). Data sources for Aim 3 will include standardized measures of the host of clinical challenges that
disrupt therapy and that are specifically targeted by the CF approach as well as novel, idiosyncratic measures
(daily diaries) of challenges."
10938005,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Dr. David Lin is a Neurocritical Care and Neurorehabilitation specialized Neurologist at VA Providence Health
Care System whose career goal is to conduct mechanistic clinical trials of neurorehabilitation technologies, to
maximize neuroplastic potential and functional recovery for Veterans with motor deficits after stroke. A critical
step towards this goal is for Dr. Lin to perform research and acquire training in the phenotype of upper extremity
stroke hemiparesis as well as its neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings. Dr. Lin currently leads a
natural history study of upper extremity stroke motor recovery in which he has demonstrated the feasibility of
recruiting over 180 acute stroke patients with arm weakness into a research study and tracking their upper
extremity impairments from the acute to chronic stages of recovery. Dr. Lin is completing an analysis of patterns
of EEG cortical connectivity change after stroke in his VA CDA-1 project. In this Career Development Award-2
(CDA-2) project, Dr. Lin proposes to test specific systems neuroscience, model-driven hypothesis about the
relationship between the phenotype of post-stroke upper extremity hemiparesis with anatomy (assessed by
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging) and physiology (assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation) of
specific descending motor pathways (corticospinal and corticoreticulospinal). Specifically, he will (1)
Deconstruct post-stroke hemiparesis into its individual components (2) Map descending motor tract anatomy
onto distinct components of post-stroke hemiparesis and (3) Map descending motor tract physiology onto
distinct components of post-stroke hemiparesis. To achieve these aims, Dr. Lin plans to conduct a new and
dedicated cross-sectional study at Providence VA of N = 75 Veterans with chronic hemiparesis after stroke.
The proposed CDA-2 project will provide Dr. Lin with fundamental training in motor control, structural
neuroimaging, motor systems neurophysiology, and applied biostatistics for neurorehabilitation research as
well as further experience with research skills necessary to lead an independent VA laboratory and clinical
trials. Dr. Lin will achieve the science and training proposed with the support of a world-class and
multidisciplinary mentorship team. Dr. Leigh Hochberg (primary mentor) and Dr. John Krakauer (primary co-
mentor) will coordinate a panel of content mentors (neuroimaging- Dr. Jennifer Barredo, neurophysiology- Dr.
Noah Philip, and kinematics and motor control - Dr. Steven Kautz) and subject advisors (neuroimaging- Dr.
Sanes, motor systems physiology- Dr. Monica Perez, neurotechnology- Dr. Karunesh Ganguly, applied
biostatistics- Dr. Jeff Goldsmith). Dr. Lin has developed a systematic mentoring and didactic plan to
complement the scientific activities in his proposed project. All of these activities will leverage the extensive
resources and world-class environment of VA RR&D Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechnology (CfNN)
at Providence VA and research affiliate, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Thus, the
proposed VA patient-oriented research project, in concert with the mentorship and training plan, will provide
Dr. Lin with the scientific insights and skills that are essential for him to develop into an independent VA
physician-scientist career at the cutting edge of stroke neurorehabilitation and systems neuroscience."
10936248,"Abstract: Poor care quality and safety in long-term care (LTC) facilities (i.e., nursing homes, assisted living)—
particularly for persons living with dementia (PLWD)—leads to preventable falls, emergency department visits
and hospitalizations, injuries, and increased mortality. PLWD make up 50% of LTC residents; they are more
likely to experience preventable falls when care quality and safety are lacking. Staffing shortages and
inexperience can result in poor working conditions, which again lead to increased staff workload and turnover.
Given these concerns, it has never been more important to integrate evidence-based tools such as decision-
support technologies (DS tech) into LTCs. DS tech has proven to be efficient in improving care quality and
safety in both hospital settings and primary care centers. However, it is not clear whether DS tech is as
effective in challenging LTC settings, and little is known about their impact on LTC staff practice, LTC staff
burnout, and quality-of-life outcomes among PLWD in LTCs.
Our goal is to improve LTC quality of work (for staff) and LTC quality/safety of care (for PLWD) by
implementing context- and workflow-specific DS tech. This objective will be achieved through three aims: (1)
characterizing LTC contexts to identify implementation requirements for effective DS tech; (2) implementing
and evaluating two DS tech prototypes for LTCs; and (3) tracking adaptations of the two DS tech tools in each
study site. The two DS tech tools will focus on fall prevention and staff-burden detection. We will collect data
from one nursing home and two assisted living facilities. This research is guided by the SEIPS 2.0 framework
and will produce foundational knowledge to effectively adapt and implement impactful LTC-based DS tech.
The unique contribution of this study lies in using DS tech in LTC settings, expanding the type of data source
and direct user type for DS tech, and using a mixed-methods approach, which is novel in DS-tech studies.
Successful completion of this study will create a foundation for DS-tech implementation in LTCs by informing
the science of (a) multilevel LTC contexts, (b) guidelines for implementing DS tech in LTCs and improving
implementation outcomes, (c) safety outcomes among PLWD in LTCs, and (d) improvement of staff
performance and wellbeing. Although we will focus on two diverse DS tech tools, our findings can be translated
into the implementation of other DS tech (e.g., family portals, antimicrobial stewardship) in LTCs. The
expanded functionality of DS tech (in terms of data sources and user types) that is proposed in this application
will ensure the use of all relevant data for best decision support.
Making progress toward honoring LTC residents' choices requires customized, evidence-based DS tech. This
project will improve identification and capture of residents' choices by expanding the pool of data sources and
data providers. This application will advance AHRQ efforts by developing evidence-based solutions to improve
healthcare safety, quality, and efficiency and support the health of LTC-based PLWD, a priority population."
10910537,"With more than 13% of adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorders each year, prevention of depressive
disorders has become a key priority for the NIMH. Unfortunately, we have no widely available interventions to
reduce morbidity and mortality (e.g. public health impact). To address this need, we developed a multi-health
system “collaboratory” to develop and evaluate the primary care based-technology “behavioral vaccine,”
Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive-Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Therapy (CATCH-IT)
(14 adolescent, 4 parent modules). Using this health-system collaboratory model, CATCH-IT demonstrated
evidence of efficacy in prevention of depressive episodes in phase-three clinical trials in the United States and
China. However, like many “package” interventions, CATCH-IT became larger and more complex across efficacy
trials. Thus, adolescents and parents were less willing to complete all 18 modules, suggesting adolescent dose
“tolerability” issues (e.g. satisfaction, acceptability and resource use, “time as cost”). Similarly, primary care
practices have “scalability” challenges (acceptability, feasibility, resource use, cost), resulting in declining
REACH (percent of at-risk youth who complete intervention). To prepare for implementation studies and
dissemination, we need to address adolescent tolerability and practice/health system scalability, while preserving
efficacy. Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) uses a systematic analytic approach and a factorial
randomized clinical trial design to address efficacy, tolerability, and scalability, simultaneously. We will use a
MOST approach to optimize CATCH-IT for the prevention of depression (indicated prevention, i.e., elevated
symptoms of depression) in practices and health systems representative of US geography and population. The
theoretically grounded components of CATCH-IT selected for study and optimization are: behavioral activation,
cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and parent program. We will use a 4-factor (2x2x2x2) fully
crossed factorial design with N=16 cells (20 per cell, 15% dropout) to evaluate the contribution of each
component. We propose to randomize N=378 (N=189) from each health system site. The at-risk youth will be
high school students 13 through 18 years old, not currently experiencing a mood disorder, but with subsyndromal
symptoms of depression (moderate to high risk). Using the efficient factorial design, we can assess the
contribution to prevention efficacy of each component. Thus, the MOST study design will enable us to eliminate
non-contributing components while preserving efficacy and to optimize CATCH-IT by strengthening tolerability
and scalability by reducing “resource use.” By reducing resource use, we anticipate satisfaction and acceptability
will also increase, preparing the way for an implementation trial and eventual US Preventive Services Task Force
endorsement to support dissemination. Thus, our primary question is whether one component, or perhaps
two, can demonstrate an equivalent effect to combinations of other components in terms of efficacy, whilst also
demonstrating superior adolescent/family tolerability scalability over a 12-month follow-up."
10911148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This career development proposal will provide Dr. Michelle Kelly, a Pediatric Hospitalist Physician at the
University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, with the training and mentorship required for
success as an independent, physician-scientist leveraging tools and technologies supporting family
engagement to improve the quality and safety of care of hospitalized children. Dr. Kelly has championed efforts
to promote family engagement, including redesigning hospital rounds to include families and implementing a
bedside portal – an online application giving families’ access to parts of their child’s inpatient medical record.
She has attained an MS in Clinical Investigation to develop skills in conducting literature reviews, analyzing
quantitative data, and designing clinical and translational studies. Building on this foundation, her proposed
K08 career development plan focuses on three knowledge gaps: qualitative methods, human-centered design
of interventions to support health communication and literacy, and systematic intervention implementation and
evaluation. With the protected time afforded by this award for coursework, participation in national meetings
and mentored research, Dr. Kelly will attain the critical skills necessary to develop and disseminate healthcare
interventions. In her proposed research plan, she will develop BedsideNotes as a model intervention and
implementation bundle. This bundle will consist of expanding the bedside portal to share inpatient doctors’
admission and progress notes with families and complementary implementation strategies to optimally support
family engagement while mitigating unintended negative consequences. She will develop this bundle using
these aims: 1) identify family and clinician perspectives of barriers, facilitators and strategies to share inpatient
doctors’ notes; 2) develop BedsideNotes design requirements; and 3) implement and evaluate the feasibility
and preliminary efficacy of BedsideNotes in a pilot study with families of hospitalized children. This proposed
study responds directly to NOT-HS-13-011 and addresses multiple research areas, including health IT design
and implementation, and will provide preliminary data describing the use and impact of health IT on family
engagement and patient safety outcomes. As faculty at an institution with extensive research infrastructure, Dr.
Kelly is in an ideal environment to complete this proposed research and pursue advanced training. Her career
development plan includes protected time for coursework and mentorship from a committed team of experts in
human factors and systems engineering, patient safety, qualitative methods, health communication/literacy,
pediatric ethics, and health IT intervention design, implementation, evaluation and dissemination. At the end of
this project, Dr. Kelly will have the preliminary data necessary to support a competitive R01 proposal in which
she will test whether this intervention improves family engagement and safety concern reporting. This K08
award will also allow her to achieve her goal of independently leading a program leveraging tools and
technologies to improve the safety of care of hospitalized children, an AHRQ priority population."
10911149,"Dysfunction in BDNF confers vulnerability to psychosocial stress, and myriad data generated during the initial
funding period of this project revealed that disruption of BDNF signaling also potentiated neuroinflammation and
inflammation-induced depressive-like behaviors. The US veteran population is well known to suffer high rates of
psychological stress and chronic inflammatory conditions as well as disproportionately increased risk of
depression and suicide. Understanding the contribution of neurobiological substrates that mediate this increased
risk is necessary for developing better treatment strategies to treat suffering US veterans. Unfortunately,
mechanism(s) mediating this vulnerability remain elusive. Our recent discoveries suggest that dysfunction in the
BDNF system represents a genetic vulnerability factor for the development of depression, and preliminary data
have identified therapeutically targetable neural substrates that appear to mediate this vulnerability. More
specifically, dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
depressive symptomotology. Of functional significance, two metabolic branches of the kynurenine pathway are
physically compartmentalized. The neuroprotective branch that forms kynurenic acid resides in astrocytes. The
neurotoxic branch that forms 3- hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid resides in microglia. A large body of
evidence implicates the kynurenine pathway in depression associated with inflammation. However, a role for this
pathway in stress- or inflammation-induced depressive behavior has been largely unexplored. We have recently
reported that low-level stress, consisting of psychosocial and environmental challenges, increases
neuroprotective factors kynurenic acid and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the forebrain of wild-type, but
not BDNF+/- mice. In striking contrast, levels of the neurotoxic kynurenine metabolite 3-hydroxykynurenine are
markedly increased in BDNF+/- mice. These observations support our contention that protective mechanisms
present in wild-type mice are absent in BDNF deficient animals. Mice with genetic disruptions in the BDNF
system exhibit pronounced neuroinflammation, oxidative kynurenine metabolism and depressive-like behavior
relative to wild-type mice. Our overall hypothesis is that during exposure to depression risk factors (stress or
inflammation), the activity-dependent release of BDNF increases IL-10 production, which in turn modulates
kynurenine pathway metabolism resulting in increased levels of kynurenic acid. Under conditions of BDNF
deficiency or dysfunction, the absence of these neuroprotective mechanisms results in a stress-sensitive
phenotype. We will use BDNF heterozygous mice (BDNF+/- mice), which exhibit marked reductions in BDNF
expression, to mechanistically explore the aims proposed. To test our hypotheses in a translationally relevant
model, we will use transgenic mice carrying the met allele of the human bdnf gene (BDNFmet knock-in mice). This
single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) is a risk factor associated with depression and suicide. That the
kynurenine pathway may play a role in the brain's response to stress is an innovative perspective, which may
provide insight into mechanism(s) mediating vulnerability and resilience. The preclinical experiments outlined in
this proposal will serve to increase our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the
sensitivity of certain individuals to depression risk factors. The proposed experiments will also identify potentially
novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate depression symptoms and suicidality in suffering veterans."
10911152,"Increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce at the senior level is essential to facilitating the nation's
research agenda,1 to training future generations of scientists,2 to advising public health policy makers, to
enriching scientific approaches, and to reducing national health disparities.1 Requisite to this goal of
diversity at the senior scientist level is providing a greater number of underrepresented scientists with key
skills to navigate to a productive, engaging, and rewarding senior faculty position and science portfolio. The
long-term objective of the MAVEN program is to expand the national pool of qualified women and minority
candidates for senior scientist positions across all NIGMS areas of science. We intend to create a self-
sustaining community committed to inclusive excellence in science. We will do so by adapting best
education practices from other industries in executive leadership, strategic career planning, and institution
culture change, to create a sustainable, but intensive program with objective evaluation metrics. Our
innovations include proactive invitations to apply and randomization of those applicants to a control group or
to program attendance. Four cohorts of scientists will be invited to attend MAVEN, two 5-day institutes
focused on senior scientist career planning, respect-based leadership, evidence-based mentoring,
organizational culture problem solving, transparency and Open Science, interdisciplinary team collaboration
and inclusivity, effective science thought leadership and public engagement with science. These residential
summer institutes will be comprised of didactics, discussions, and interactive individual and team-based
activities. Between the institutes there will be 10 months of mentorship, networking, and conduct of
institutional responsible conduct of research projects. Target program participants are scientists 10-15 years
from their final training, who identify as belonging to an ethnicity, race or gender under-represented at the
senior levels of faculty, and who currently hold one or more NIGMS-funded R01 or equivalent grants. To
achieve the MAVEN long-term objective, MAVEN scientists will be provided the skills to attain: 1) increased
career satisfaction (primary outcome); 2) peak academic productivity; 3) expanded scientific networks; and
4) leadership ascension. Program success will be evaluated by comparison of the control group to MAVEN
scientists for change in career satisfaction scores and a blended Major Educational Score Index comprised
of h-index, relative citation ratio, number of publications in journals with an impact factor > 5, and annual
federal grant dollar amounts. We will also explore changes to professional scientific network size and the
leadership ascension between the two groups, tested quantitatively.
If our scientific leaders and role models are diverse, we stand to benefit from enrichment of the pool of
future investigators, the broader perspective in research agenda prioritization, the greater success in
recruiting diverse research participants, and the enhanced ability to reduce health disparities."
10930939,"Project Summary. Cancer deaths remain at an all-time high in the United States leaving an urgent clinical need
to develop novel therapeutic strategies to help patients. The lack of effective treatments is in part due to
underlying complexities in cancer that current scientific approaches are just beginning to uncover. Technological
advances are rapidly changing the landscape of scientific discovery; for example, the combination of
mathematical modeling in tandem with laboratory based validation leading to better combinational therapies to
treat cancer. For this reason, I propose training in both with the F99/K00 Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Fellow
Transition Award. For the F99 phase, the dissertation research, I will focus on laboratory based research skills
to identify and propose a novel therapeutic to treat cancers. In a high level CRISPR screen targeting about 580
genes on the cell surface we found that Integrin Alpha V (ITGAV) is essential for the survival of solid tumors
(colon, pancreatic, and breast cancer). To validate ITGAV as the most essential integrin we designed a second
layer screen targeting all 26 integrins and found that ITGAV and Integrin Beta 5 (ITGB5) are the only essential
integrins in solid tumors. Interestingly, integrins must for an obligate heterodimer between an alpha and a beta
subunit of which ITGAV and ITGB5 are one of the known 24. As the more essential pair, ITGAV was probed with
a high-density CRISPR tiling scan and we found a small pocket to be essential for ITGAV function and it was
amendable to small molecule binding. A structure based analysis found a loop structure of the beta pair of ITGAV
interacts with the discovered pocket, leading to our hypothesis that the pocket is essential for the heterodimer
stability between ITGAV and its beta pair. Indeed, from a high-throughput screen of 500 small molecules we
found one compound that appears to bind in our pocket and disrupt the heterodimer between ITGAV and ITGB5.
Further validation of this potential will be the remaining work to be done for the dissertation research and upon
completion, will fill an unmet clinical need since no there no FDA approved drugs targeting integrins approved
for cancer indications. To further advance the potential to treat cancer I plan to use mathematical modeling
approaches to identify novel therapeutic strategies by understanding the complexities of cancer signaling during
the K00 phase, the proposed postdoctoral work. To study complex cancer signaling, in collaboration with Dr.
Pirrotte, we generated kinase activity scores in cells where ITGAV was knocked out. With this data we can model
the effects of signaling as it relates to measurable changes in the cancer cells. Specifically, we will study cell
cycle control, which is inhibited with ITGAV loss. Additionally, we can model known inhibitors to common
signaling cascades as novel combinational therapeutic strategies. To confirm our model, I will use laboratory
based skill developed during the F99 phase. Overall with the training with the F99/K00 award I will gain skills to
be able to build mathematical models to study cancer and validate those models with laboratory based skills.
This will allow me to become and independent research and leading scientist in translational research."
10934248,"Project Summary
Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are characterized by the
deposition of pathological proteins, such as pathological tau in AD and coritcobasal degeneration (CBD),
among others, and pathological a-synuclein (a-syn) in Lewy body dementia (LBD). Transmission of pathological
proteins along the neuronal network is believed to be a key mechanism for disease progression. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms that modulate this transmission process remain largely unknown. For one, it
is well documented that the conformational diversity of a-syn and tau contribute to disease heterogeneity, but it
is unclear how conformer type influences the progression of pathology. Further, the mediation of the disease
process by gene expression is incompletely understood, particularly in the context of network transmission.
Understanding these molecular mechanisms will provide critical insights into the selective vulnerability of
different brain regions to pathological protein transmission and identify new targets for drug development.
Here, we propose to identify candidate genes that are responsible for this selective regional vulnerability to
distinct pathological ɑ-Syn and tau conformations using mathematical modeling, thereby providing a heretofore
inaccessible, mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of AD/ADRD. We will combine our computational
approach with new in vivo mouse synucleinopathy and tauopathy datasets as well as a high-throughput in vitro
screening platform for the functional validation of genes. The focus on mouse proteinopathy is motivated by the
long track record of success in using these models as proxies for human disease and the high degree of
experimental control they afford. Our approach is novel both in terms of mathematical modeling and the
experimental systems explored.
In the first phase (R21) of our proposal, we will quantify the a-syn pathology induced by injecting 2 different
conformers: PFF and GCI. We will then apply a novel mathematical model, NexIS2, which explains the
accumulation and transmission of pathology over time in terms of both gene-independent and gene-mediated
processes, allowing us to identify in silico candidate genes that could be key mediators of disease progression.
These genes will be functionally validated with high-throughput in vitro screening of induced pathology in primary
neuron culture. The best genes will then be fed back into NexIS2 to create a comprehensive model of network
transmission for each conformer. In the second phase (R33), we will apply this established pipeline to identify
the key gene mediators of transmission for a third a-syn conformer (LB a-syn) and 2 distinct tau conformers (AD-
tau and CBD-tau). We will also examine the effect of amyloid on tauopathy progression in a joint mouse model
using NexIS2. Our approach could become a computational test bed for future hypothesis generation and
testing, and should have broader applicability to other proteinopathic neurodegenerative diseases."
10934502,"Malaria, caused by Plasmodium species, is an unresolved global health burden. Although insecticide
treated bed nets and antimalarial drugs have reduced the incidence and severity of malaria in some
regions, infections are on the rise with 247,000,000 cases and >600,000 fatalities in 2021. Of additional
concern, front line artesminin drug therapies are threatened by emerging drug resistant parasites. Thus,
effective vaccines remain a critical goal to combat the global threat of malaria. Due to logistics and the
development of Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) challenge in humans, most initial clinical trials
of candidate vaccines are carried out in malaria naïve individuals rather than in malaria endemic regions.
Unquestionably, the most successful of these candidates are Radiation Attenuated Sporozoites (RAS). RAS
vaccination, originally described in mice, elicits pre-erythrocytic (liver-stage) immunity that can completely
prevent development of symptomatic blood-stage infection after exposure to virulent sporozoites in
humans3. RAS vaccination (by the i.v. route with cryopreserved RAS) in malaria naïve individuals can be up
to 100% effective and immunity can last for at least a year. However, a major hurdle for progress in malaria
vaccines is the finding of substantially reduced efficacy of RAS vaccination in malaria endemic regions
 To address this knowledge gap, we generated a mouse model where prior exposure to non-lethal P.
yoelii 17XNL (Py) blood-stage infection compromises P. berghei ANKA (Pb) RAS-induced protective
immunity against virulent Pb sporozoite challenge (Please see Fig. 1 for experimental design schematic).
We further show that prior malaria exposure results in a prolonged (>12 month) reduction in the capacity to
make malaria-specific CD8 T cell responses against RAS immunization. In considering how such durable
immune dysfunction could occur, we noted that one long-term signature of malaria exposure in humans and
mice is the essentially lifelong persistence of hemozoin (Hz) in specific tissues (liver, spleen, bone marrow).
Hz is a non-degradable biocrystal formed during blood-stage infection as Plasmodium metabolizes
hemoglobin in infected RBC. Importantly, we determined that injection of synthetic Hz and equilibration in
tissues also compromised CD8 T cell responses to RAS immunization. The goal of this RO1 is to gain
mechanistic insight into Hz-mediated T cell dysfunction in an effort to improve the efficacy of malaria
vaccines in endemic areas. Aim 1. Determine how Hz disrupts antigen-presenting functions required for
CD8 T cell priming after RAS immunization. Aim 2: Define the extent to which Hz compromises RAS-
induced liver T resident memory (Trm) and circulating T cell memory (Tcircm) protective functions. Aim 3.
Identify translatable immunization regimens to overcome Hz-mediated disruption of CD8 T cell priming and
liver stage immunity after RAS vaccination."

10940527,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This Administrative Supplement application is submitted under PA-20-272 in response to NOT-AG-23-032. In
the parent project (R01 MD018265; 2022-2027; “APS2”), we are assessing the early progression of non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis over 10 years from mid to late adulthood and evaluating
the role of the gut microbiome in mediating the effect of diet on the liver outcome in a subset of the population-
based Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) among Hawaii participants from three racial/ethnic groups (Asian, Native
Hawaiian, White) with known disparate susceptibility to NAFLD. In this supplement request, we propose to
investigate the relationship of the gut microbiome, NAFLD, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) in the full MEC and the baseline APS1. We showed an up to 2-fold difference in age-adjusted risk of
AD/ADRD across the five racial/ethnic groups in MEC based on Medicare claims data, with the highest risks and
the highest frequency of APOE ε4 risk allele carriers found among African Americans as previously reported and
also Native Hawaiians (Alzheimer's & Dementia 2022). While we replicated the association of known risk factors
with ADRD in the MEC (Alzheimer's & Dementia 2023), only one third of the 16,410 cases were explained by
known risk factors including APOE, and this population attributable fraction varied substantially by race/ethnicity.
These findings underscore the need to identify additional risk factors for ADRD, especially contributors to the
striking racial/ethnic disparities. Emerging evidence suggests that the highly prevalent NAFLD, detected in over
30% of older adults, is a risk factor for ADRD/dementia and that pro-inflammatory gut microbiota may promote
neuroinflammatory etiology of ADRD, corroborating the putative liver-brain axis. Thus, we propose to (Aim 1a)
evaluate the association of NAFLD with subsequent ADRD risk in a longitudinal analysis of the MEC cohort
(21,770 ADRD cases, over 20y of follow-up) and also to (Aim 1b) assess the relationship between an exclusive
biomarker of microbial inflammation (plasma LBP) and the NIA-designated sole clinical biomarker for neuro-
inflammation (plasma GFAP) in a nested case-control study of 500 pairs of ADRD cases and controls, composed
evenly of women and men and five racial/ethnic groups. Separately, in the subset of the 300 MEC participants
without history of ADRD who are being followed for the parent APS2, we will analyze the baseline APS1 data
and archived blood samples to (Aim 2) explore the relationship of 16S rRNA gene sequence-based gut microbial
features (alpha and beta diversity, taxa composition, imputed functions), MRI measurement of liver fat, and the
plasma neuroinflammation marker GFAP. The proposed study is within the scope and timeline of the parent
project supported by NIMHD to better understand the impact of the gut microbiome and NAFLD and to better
represent and promote racial/ethnic minority and rural population health. Findings from the supplement study
will be used to develop grant applications to further interrogate the link between gut health and ADRD etiology
and to devise lifestyle intervention strategies to improve the gut microbiome, resolve NAFLD, and prevent ADRD."
10932280,"Quantifying TF-DNA binding, including locations, distributions, and binding mechanism is an important
first step toward the understanding of gene regulatory machinery. In this proposal, we will develop an
atomic force microscope (AFM)-based single-molecule imaging method for the detection and
quantification of TF-DNA binding. The new technique brings the methods of mathematics and statistics to
bear on the technological breakthrough in an experimental system. This new technology is inherently
different from classical single-molecule imaging approaches, which solely rely on the technician’s
experimental skills. Combining mathematics, statistics, bioengineering, and chemical engineering, this
proposal creates a perfect platform for multidisciplinary research by merging analytics, biology, and
engineering. We see this as a translational effort of what started as a lab-bench discovery into a new
biotechnology tool, as the proposed machine learning (ML) methods combined with robot hands pave a
revolutionary path to the massive production and fully automated system for precise TF-DNA imaging.
Analytically, we face three challenges: construction of high-throughput images, prediction of TF binding
region, and force decomposition to recover the binding mechanism. To attack these problems, we will (1)
develop smoothing spline diffusion and annealing process for image super-resolution, (2) develop novel
reinforcement learning algorithm for automatic TFBSs searching, and (3) develop graph ANOVA method
to compare the TF-DNA binding mechanism. Our efforts in these areas should lead to (1) fundamental
advances in image super-resolution and reinforcement learning algorithms which enjoy both algorithm
simplicity and theoretical rigorous; (2) development and refinement of the technology for the rapid and
precise genome-wide identification and quantification of TF-DNA binding sites using AFM technology; (3)
visualization of not only TF-DNA binding sequence and location but also 3-D structures; (4) investigation
of TF-DNA interactions under nearly physiological conditions by controlling the reaction conditions
experimentally; and most importantly; (5) prototyping of a fully automatic system for potential technology
translation. This system permits accurate detection of TF-DNA binding with a rapid response that requires
essentially no user intervention for field deployment and data capture."

 Scientific teams led by Prof. Oliver Fiehn (UC Davis), Prof. Charles Evans (University of Michigan) and
Dr. Tom Metz (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) will develop and validate a unified, cloud-based data
processing workflow and database for high resolution LC-MS/MS metabolomics and lipidomics data. This new
database, LC-BinBase, will serve as cornerstone to harmonize and standardize metabolomics data reports.
Through both experimental and computational robustness tests, we will show that different metabolomics
laboratories can generate consensus data sets if the same set of data acquisition methods are used, even if
instruments from different vendors are used.
 This work will lead the way for next-generation metabolomics, towards faster, more reproducible and
robust data processing that leads to standardized data reports and improved interpretability for biomedical
researchers. To this end, we will develop algorithms to apply LC-BinBase with calculated metabolite annotation
confidence scores for both hydrophilic interaction- and reversed phase chromatography, and for both QTOF
and orbital ion trap high resolution mass spectrometers. These confidence scores will be calculated from
deviations of probability distributions of experimental and predicted retention times, accurate masses, MS/MS
entropy similarity scores and ion mobility data. We will validate the usability of LC-BinBase reports for
biomedical researchers by interlaboratory comparison studies on diverse sets of mouse organs, plus different
cell types and biofluids. Data usability will be improved by a unified compound metadata list for all annotated
metabolites.
 We will organize events and workshops to invite the scientific community to beta-test LC-BinBase."

Around 262,000 cysteine residues are intricately distributed throughout the human proteome. These cysteines
play pivotal roles in influencing protein folding, stability, enzymatic functions, and the response to oxidative stress.
Chemical probes designed to target cysteines are critical tools for investigating protein functionality and
advancing drug development. Chemical proteomics, particularly cysteine-directed activity-based protein profiling
(ABPP), has emerged as a fundamental technique for studying proteinaceous cysteines. ABPP employs a wide-
spectrum cysteine-reactive probe to effectively pinpoint cysteine sites across a variety of proteins, enabling
comprehensive functional exploration and facilitating ligand discovery. Traditionally, extracellular proteinaceous
cysteines have been largely neglected in the field of chemical proteomics. It was also believed that these
cysteines mainly formed disulfide bonds to stabilize protein structures. However, recent research has challenged
this notion by revealing the dynamic nature of extracellular redox environments, which can significantly influence
proteinaceous cysteine reactivity in the extracellular space. Consequently, a substantial knowledge gap remains
in identifying extracellular proteins containing unmodified, reactive cysteines in specific biological contexts. To
address this gap, this research program aims to establish an innovative chemical proteomic platform tailored for
mapping extracellular proteinaceous cysteines across a wide range of biological scenarios. These scenarios
include T cell activation, GGT5 genetic knockout, and various chemical treatments. Subsequently, we will
investigate the potential druggability of these extracellular proteinaceous cysteines. Finally, utilizing the insights
gained from targeting druggable extracellular proteinaceous cysteines, we aim to manipulate their functionality
in pursuit of two key outcomes: inducing cell-cell interactions and promoting targeted protein degradation."

The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and cellular therapy program
proposes to continue its contributions as a BMT CTN Core Center with its expertise in HCT, novel cell and gene
therapies, and continued stellar accrual to BMT CTN trials along with high-quality data submission. We also
propose a trial addressing a high-priority concept identified at the 2021 BMT CTN State of the Science
Symposium (SOSS) that builds on MCW’s experience in developing a first-in-human bispecific chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR T) cell product targeting two B cell antigens, CD19 and CD20 (CAR20.19). Results of a Phase 1
dose-escalation study published in Nature Medicine in 2020 identified a safe dose for Phase II studies while
providing preliminary efficacy and safety data in patients with B-cell malignancies. This led to the development
of a Phase I/II single-center study at MCW for relapsed, refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
(NCT04186520). Despite advances in therapies for MCL that have improved progression-free survival (PFS),
patients with adverse features, including TP53 mutation, 17p deletions, complex karyotype, and blastoid
histology, continue to have poor outcomes and survival. As MCL is known to have both CD19 and CD20
expression, we hypothesized that dual targeting with CAR20.19 T cells could improve PFS and overall survival
in R/R MCL compared to currently available therapies. We can now report promising results in 17 patients with
an overall response rate of 100% and only two patients relapsing to date with a median follow-up of 1 year for
all patients. Excitingly, these responses occurred in the setting of limited CAR-associated toxicity with no patients
with grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome. We now propose a Phase II multicenter study of MB-CART2019.1
(zamtocabtagene autoleucel) therapy as frontline consolidation for high-risk Mantle Cell Lymphoma. As
identified in the SOSS report in 2021, improving outcomes with novel cell-based therapies for high-risk
MCL is an unmet clinical need. Given our preliminary single center data with excellent efficacy, a favorable
toxicity profile, and our in-depth experience with this product (>90 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
treated with CAR20.19 T cells since 2017), we are uniquely poised to develop and lead this trial within the BMT
CTN. As high-risk MCL represents a small subset of patients in a disease that only represents 5% of all newly
diagnosed lymphomas, the BMT CTN is the optimal organization to successfully conduct the proposed cell
therapy trial. We hypothesize that dual-targeted CAR20.19 T-cell therapy will improve outcomes for high-risk
MCL patients compared to historical outcomes and represent an important innovation in the field to redefine the
treatment approaches for patients with adverse prognostic MCL."

10932157,"Project Summary:
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical
spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an
aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be
significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT).
A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics,
lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain
(NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive
value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory
disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and
representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years,
enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the
development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis
of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big
data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.
 Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10
MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health
information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system
(LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during
routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the
MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which
clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.
 The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically
relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including
demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI-
derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of
algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity.
Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the
developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in
MS."

seeking from multiple pathways. Multiple pathways to recovery exist, but less is known about
the key mechanisms of recovery that Black adults specifically utilize to achieve recovery. The
goal of this study is to understand how Black adults with SMI navigate the process of finding
and then deciding to use formal services, informal supports, both or personal recovery, and
which mechanisms within these unique pathways are critical to promoting recovery. It is
grounded in the CHIME personal recovery framework, which encompasses five recovery
processes, including Connectedness, Hope, and optimism about the future, Identity, Meaning in
Life, and Empowerment, to deepen our understanding of how Black adults with SMI
conceptualize the recovery process in relation to the CHIME framework and understand how
service use (formal care, informal supports, or both, and personal recovery) promote and
interact with the CHIME recovery processes. A qualitative phenomenological research design
will be used to address the following aims: Aim 1: To explore how the dimensions of the
recovery process (Connectedness, etc.) are experienced by Black adults with SMI, explore
whether there are additional dimensions of recovery specific to Black adults with SMI, and to
examine which of these dimensions are most salient for this population and Aim 2: To identify
how formal and informal pathways of mental health supports facilitate the dimensions of the
recovery process and what specific aspects of these supports facilitate recovery in Black adults
with SMI. A purposive-convenience sampling approach will be used to recruit Black adults with
SMI (n=40) from two groups – those who are involved in formal services or have used them in
the last year (n=20) and those who have not sought formal services but engaged with informal
and personal approaches to recovery within the last year (n=20). Data collection includes one
semi-structured interview and interpretive phenomenological analysis will guide data analysis."

 Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) affects 1-4% of adults and is associated with weight
loss, nutritional deficiencies, suicidality, and psychosocial impairment. ARFID is heterogeneous, with poor
intake characterized by extreme fear of choking, vomiting, or allergic reaction (ARFID-fear of aversive
consequences); lack of interest in eating (ARFID-lack of interest); and/or extreme food selectivity (ARFID-
sensory sensitivity). Very little is known about the pathophysiology of this serious mental health condition,
particularly among adults whose illness has followed a chronic course. Our study will leverage unique and
complementary contributions of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in clinical psychology,
neuroendocrinology, and neuroscience to investigate the pathophysiology of ARFID in adults. We will
establish a cohort of adults age 18-45 years with ARFID (n=150) and healthy controls (n=50) matched for
sex and age to investigate how, across units of analysis, RDoC constructs contribute to ARFID phenotypes.
First, we hypothesize that Negative Valence (acute threat/fear) hyperactivity (hormones: cortisol in response
to a meal; circuitry: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex activation during a validated
food-cue paradigm) will correlate with severity of ARFID-fear of aversive consequences. Second, we
hypothesize that Arousal/Regulatory (homeostasis) dysfunction (hormones: CKK, ghrelin in response to a
meal; circuitry: hypothalamus activation during a validated food-cue paradigm) will correlate with severity of
ARFID-lack of interest. Third, we hypothesize that Cognitive Systems (somatosensory perception) over-
sensitivity (hormones: oxytocin in response to a meal; circuitry: activation in the somatosensory cortex and
supplemental motor cortex during a validated food-cue paradigm) will correlate with severity of ARFID-
sensory sensitivity. We also expect each ARFID phenotype to have greater dysfunction in the corresponding
RDoC construct than controls. This study will be innovative and unique by providing an empirical investigation
of an understudied clinical presentation and by investigating—for the first time—ARFID pathophysiology in
adults. In sum, conceptualizing ARFID within an RDoC framework that integrates both endocrine signaling
and neural circuitry has strong potential to advance precision medicine in ARFID by identifying mechanistic
targets that could be intervened upon (e.g., through neuromodulation and/or hormone agonists/antagonists)
to reduce the burden of ARFID across the lifespan."

10907750,"Project Summary/Abstract
Physical inactivity and poor diet quality, including low fruit and vegetable consumption and high sugar-
sweetened beverages, have been linked with diabetes, overweight/obesity and numerous chronic health
conditions. For Latina women in the U.S., the disproportionately low physical activity (PA) levels and unhealthy
dietary habits contribute to the high and rising prevalence of diabetes and overweight/obesity, as well as heart
disease, hypertension, and stroke. Reducing these disparities requires culturally appropriate interventions that
promote multiple health behaviors of PA and healthy eating. The majority of lifestyle interventions that target
these behaviors in Latinos have been implemented using face-to-face approaches, which may not be
accessible to Latinas due to common barriers (e.g., lack of time, fear of immigration enforcement, and lack of
transportation) and can require costly resources to implement. Internet-based interventions can overcome
barriers of face-to-face approaches and have potential for wide reach. Latinos now report higher Internet usage
than White and Black adults (95% Latinos use Internet) and are more likely than non-Latinos to use their
mobile devices to access health information. While most Latinas report more than one modifiable risk factor
contributing to cardiometabolic disease (physical inactivity, poor diet quality) no Internet-based interventions
have yet been developed that are culturally tailored to address both diet and PA needs of Latinas. Our
research team has already developed and tested a culturally and linguistically adapted, theory-driven, Internet-
based intervention promoting PA in Latina women, Pasos Hacia la Salud, that has shown success by
increasing and maintaining PA gains in this population over 12 months. Latina participants in our team’s PA
studies have also expressed interest in learning more about dietary quality. Thus, we will expand our Internet-
based PA intervention to include promotion of healthy eating in Latinas as a more comprehensive approach to
reducing cardiometabolic disease in Latinas. We will then test the preliminary efficacy of the adapted web-
based multiple behavior change intervention for Latinas in a 12-week pilot RCT. Participants (N=70) will be
randomized to: 1) PA and dietary intervention arm, or 2) wait-list control arm. The goal of the proposed study is
to help Latinas meet national PA and dietary guidelines for F&V and SSB consumption. This work leverages
our existing infrastructure (web-based platform), didactic training, and the unique and complementary expertise
of the mentorship team and collaborators in developing innovative technology-based and individually tailored
PA and diet interventions in at-risk populations. The proposed project will provide the PI (Dr. Benitez) training
on nutrition research and new methodologies in this area (Intervention Mapping process, evaluation of nutrition
interventions, and multiple behavior clinical trials). This study proposes a novel, low-cost and high reach
approach to reduce the burden of cardiometabolic disease in Latinas and will provide the PI with skills for
developing and conducting culturally tailored multiple behavior (nutrition and physical activity) clinical trials."
10907753,"The NADIA consortium is dedicated to identifying the mechanisms underlying the long-term effects of
adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) on brain and behavior and exploring approaches to prevent or
reverse them. Component 1 has focused on the enduring effects of AIE on hippocampal structure and function
and their behavioral sequelae. Based on our findings, our overarching hypothesis AIE causes an enduring but
reversible compromise of hippocampal synaptic function driven by interacting epigenetic, neuroinflammatory,
and glial mechanisms. During the last NADIA funding cycle we found that AIE produces a pro-inflammatory
milieu in the hippocampal formation, alterations of dendritic spine density and morphology, altered histone
acetylation and methylation, diminished astrocyte-synaptic proximity, decreases in neurogenesis, and
increases in the mobilization cell death molecular machinery. Through NADIA collaborations, we further
identified epigenetic changes that suggest specific molecular mechanisms underlying those effects.
Importantly, we have also shown that many of those effects are reversible in adulthood with pharmacological
agents in current clinical use. Our recent findings indicate that AIE results in a propensity toward anxiety-like
behavior after environmental challenge, thus suggesting the need to expand our assessments to the ventral
hippocampus. This has obvious translational implications because anxiety and stress reactivity are strong
predictors of AUD development and relapse, and suggests that some of the AIE-induced changes we have
observed in the dorsal hippocampus may be similar in the ventral region.
 Against this backdrop we propose three Specific Aims that will more fully characterize the AIE-induced
phenotypes we have identified, identify mechanisms underlying them, and explore treatments to reverse them.
Aim 1 will address the role of histone H3K27 acetylation, and other possible molecular mechanisms, in AIE-
induced dendritic spine changes, and further characterize our previously-reported reversal of AIE-induced
spine changes by donepezil. Aim 2 will follow-up our recent findings to identify mechanisms underlying AIE-
induced induction of hippocampal inflammatory markers and corresponding reductions of neurogenesis and
increased cell death cascade markers. Aim 3 is founded on preliminary data indicating that AIE causes a
decrease in astrocyte-synaptic proximity that could be of functional synaptic significance. We will confirm and
expand that finding, and assess its pharmacological reversibility in adulthood. Our goal is to explore possible
interlacing mechanisms underlying AIE effects on synaptic, inflammatory, and glial function.
 These proposed studies are all based on distinct sets of preliminary data, will address specific
epigenetic and molecular mechanisms underlying AIE effects on hippocampal structure and function, and will
expand our understanding of translationally-relevant AIE-induced phenotypes."
10907755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests as progressive loss of memory and the
ability in thinking and action. Despite thirty years accumulation of our knowledge on the pathological
mechanisms, over 400 clinical trials of drugs targeting the pathological pathways have largely failed to reduce
cognitive decline. Recent evidences from epidemiological, neuroimaging, and clinical reports have suggested
that vascular contributions are critical in the pathogenesis of AD. A reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) has
been recognized in preclinical AD population, many years before the onset of symptoms and the observed
structural atrophy in the brain. In parallel, vascular pathophysiology is associated with a lower threshold of AD
pathology in cognitive decline and dementia. The characteristic of preceding vascular alterations may offer a
new opportunity in early-stage AD diagnosis and therapeutical assessment. However, current in vivo
neuroimaging tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) exclusively focus on
large vessels, due to their limited resolution and sensitivity, while leaving the microvascular territories largely
unexplored. Our biophysical simulation work and other studies have indicated that capillaries, small arterioles
and venules could contribute more than 50% of fMRI signals and alterations of microvascular architecture lead
to profound functional changes in the human brain. Despite its intriguing insight on neurodegenerative diseases,
those models were either based on oversimplified vascular geometry or anatomical networks derived from
~1mm3 of mouse cerebral cortex, which often failed to predict the complex architecture and hemodynamics in
the human brain. The goal of the study is to establish a multiscale optical imaging technique to unravel the
microvascular architecture network in the human brain from single capillary level to tens of cubic centimeters of
tissue blocks. Pivoting on a serial sectioning optical coherence tomography combined with a two-photon
microscopy, the multiscale imaging technique leverages a high-throughput and thorough study of vasculature
pathophysiology in AD progression. The study will reconstruct volumetric architectural networks in human brain
tissues at different stages of AD, seek for important features to characterize vascular pathological alterations,
and correlate with quantitative neuropathological assessment to understand the converging path of AD pathology
during disease progression. With the foundation of imaging-based microvascular networks in the human brain,
the study will further build a computational model to investigate the cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, and fMRI
signals during AD progression. This computational framework has been validated using the microvascular
anatomy and dynamics from small animal models, and here we extend it for the first time to the human cortex.
Completion of this project will significantly advance our understanding of the role microvascular architecture
plays in AD progression that may open new avenues for early intervention and targeted therapy of AD."

The Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) requests support to provide scholarships for trainees to
attend its annual meetings in years 2023 to 2027. The 2022 meeting will be held in Orlando, FL April 10-13,
2022. The 2022 meeting will be supported by no-cost extension of the previous grant. The 2023 meeting will be
held in Salt Lake City, UT March 18-21, 2023 in conjunction with the American College of Medical Genetics
(ACMG) following their meeting. The 2024 meeting is TBD. The 2025 meeting will be held in conjunction with
the International Congress on Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Kyoto, Japan. The 2026 meeting is TBD. The 2027
meeting is TBD.
Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are an important cause of intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular
disease, cardiac disorders, hepatic and renal dysfunction, arthritis, diabetes, growth failure and blindness. As
the wide clinical and molecular spectrum of these disorders is being elucidated, in part fueled by the development
of tandem mass spectroscopy and the rapid expansion of newborn screening programs, the number of affected
individuals is now known to be much larger than originally recognized. In addition, therapies are available for
some conditions, but few clinical trials have been performed to evaluate their efficacy. Thus, much remains to
be done to better understand these severe disorders and develop effective treatments for them. For the U.S. to
remain pre-eminent in this important area of research, it is essential to attract young investigators into the field.
One effective mechanism to achieve this goal is to provide them with the opportunity to participate in the SIMD
meeting, where they can explore the field and develop scientific ties to other established investigators. The SIMD
meeting is held annually and participation, especially by young investigators, has been steadily increasing each
year. The availability of NIH travel awards has been a major reason for this increase. Trainees seeking funding
are required to submit an abstract describing original research to be presented at the meeting. We anticipate
submission of 40 abstracts for presentation at each meeting from trainees/young investigators with twice that
number for the international meeting (2025). Applications for travel awards will be competitively reviewed 4
months prior to each meeting, with the goal of making up 10 annual awards of $1,000 each for the national
meeting and up to 5 awards of $2,000 for the International meeting. Additional funds will be solicited from private
sources. Women and minority applicants will be actively recruited."

 Emergency medicine lags behind other fields in the scope and depth of its research enterprise due, in part,
to a lack of well-trained investigators. To address this, the Icahn School of Medicine Department of Emergency
Medicine, ranked 4th in the U.S. in NIH funding, established the “Mount Sinai Clinician-Scientist Training
Program in Emergency Care Research” (ECR) to train clinician-scientists in emergency care research. Having
enrolled seven outstanding postdoctoral fellows thus far, this multidisciplinary program will now be expanded to
3 slots per year and will recruit doctoral-level applicants from health-related professions in addition to clinicians
trained in the specialties involved in ECR: emergency medicine, cardiology, pulmonary, critical care, & trauma
surgery. The overall aim of the program is to provide research-minded clinicians and health-related
professionals with a strong foundation in the principles of clinical / health services research and the mentored
research experiences necessary to: a) pursue independent careers in ECR; b) become valuable, contributing
members of multidisciplinary research teams; and c) accelerate dissemination of findings and rapidly translate
their research into clinical practice.
 Led by Lynne D. Richardson, MD, an experienced investigator and successful mentor, the program partners
with Conduits – the Mount Sinai CTSA, the Center for Health Equity and Community-Engaged Research, and
the Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs, as well as colleagues in Medicine, Cardiology, Pulmonary
Medicine, Critical Care, Population Health Science & Policy, and collaborating research faculty from throughout
the institution to offer a well-rounded, collaborative research training experience. Fifty faculty members from 12
departments serve as potential research mentors or as translational or methodological advisors. Key program
components include: superb multidisciplinary mentorship, individual and collaborative research activities, formal
didactic instruction, and career and leadership development activities. Each fellow’s Individual Development Plan
includes completion of a Master’s degree in Clinical Research. Three new postdoctoral fellows will be enrolled
each year for 2-3 years of training. The program, program leadership, mentors, and fellows are evaluated
annually and the findings are used for program improvement. To increase the diversity of the research workforce
pipeline, this training grant incorporates a Short-Term Training Program in Health Disparities Research for
underrepresented minority/disadvantaged students to expose them to health disparities research in the
emergency care setting. Twelve Black and Latino predoctoral students were trained over the past two summers."
10908262,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Motor functions, such as fine motor skill, gradually decline with healthy aging as well as
the pathological aging of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These impairments considerably impact quality of life in the
elderly and are thought to precede cognitive symptoms in patients with AD. Despite overlapping phenotypes,
age-related motor deficits in physiological (i.e., healthy) and pathological (e.g., AD) aging have traditionally been
studied separately. Thus, it is unknown if motor phenotypes and the underlying mechanisms present in healthy
aging are distinct from those that precede AD cognitive symptoms. Understanding the neuropathological basis
of motor decline in healthy aging and AD is crucial for the development of treatments to reverse motor decline.
Corticospinal neurons (CSNs), which govern voluntary fine motor control as the only direct cortical outputs to the
spinal cord, are a particularly compelling candidate underlying age-related motor deficits. Because of their
extremely long axons, these neurons might be particularly vulnerable to physiological and pathological aging.
Indeed, several studies of human aging have described changes in CSNs and a specific decrease in fine motor
skills, but none have causally linked these changes with motor decline in aging. Likewise, though pyramidal
symptoms are reported in AD patients and studies have linked AD pathology to the motor cortex, there are few
studies specifically investigating the role of CSNs in AD motor symptoms. Nonetheless, mouse models that allow
cell-type specific investigation are beginning to uncover a role of CSNs in AD pathophysiology. Together, these
human and mouse studies nominate CSNs as important in age-related motor decline. However, a systematic
assessment of precise age-related changes in CSNs has yet to be performed, and the extent to which
mechanisms are shared between physiological and pathological aging is unknown. This represents a significant
gap that, if addressed, could elucidate converging molecular and cellular pathways for therapeutic targeting.
I hypothesize that CSNs contribute to fine motor decline observed in healthy aging and AD. To test this,
I propose to use a combination of behavioral, molecular, and cellular reprogramming techniques in three
independent aims. AIM 1 will use behavioral and cell silencing techniques to assess motor performance of aging
and AD mice with or without CSNs. AIM 2 will use transcriptomics to compare molecular changes amongst
adulthood, healthy aging, and AD at single-cell resolution. AIM 3 will leverage a newly developed cellular
reprogramming method from the Zhigang He and David Sinclair labs to assess the therapeutic potential of CSN-
targeted treatments in aging and AD. This treatment, a viral vector that drives expression of three genes (Oct4,
Sox2, and Klf4), was recently shown to reverse neurodegenerative vision loss in mice. In addition to addressing
fundamental scientific questions, the candidate’s training plan will include honing scientific communication,
teaching, mentorship, and clinical skills. Joint mentorship from Drs. He and Sinclair will provide excellent training
in neuroscience and aging within the well-equipped and collegial community of Harvard Medical School."
10908346,"Rachel Leon, MD, PhD is a Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine physician with a PhD in neuroscience at UT
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Her goal is to become an independently funded investigator with
expertise in neuroplacentology, a field that focuses on elucidating mechanisms of placental influence on fetal
brain development. She plans to study placental and cerebrovascular hemodynamics in fetuses with congenital
heart disease (CHD) using advanced imaging techniques. In pregnant people with fetuses diagnosed with left or
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction CHD (LVOTO and RVOTO, respectively), and healthy controls, her
specific aims are to 1) evaluate placental perfusion longitudinally and determine associated differences in
placental size and histopathology, 2) determine the impact of placental perfusion on cerebral autoregulation from
the fetal period to the early postnatal adaptation, and 3) determine how placental perfusion affects the trajectory
of regional brain growth. Dr. Leon will combine arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
determine placental perfusion at two timepoints in pregnancy with pathologic evaluation of placentas to explore
histopathologic underpinnings of perfusion abnormalities. Using serial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral
and umbilical arteries, as well as postnatal cerebral near infrared spectroscopy and blood pressure, she will
determine the maturational changes of cerebral autoregulation from prenatal to postnatal life, and how this
relates to placental perfusion. She will perform fetal brain MRI twice prenatally and again in the early postnatal
period to determine the relationship of placental perfusion to the trajectory of regional brain growth. Dr. Leon’s
innovative approach to studying the CHD placenta-brain connection will elucidate possible pathophysiologic
mechanisms for impaired brain development in the CHD population, a necessary first step for the discovery of
targeted fetal interventions. Dr. Leon has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators with
expertise in key areas: cerebral autoregulation (Lina Chalak, MD), advanced placental and fetal imaging (Diane
Twickler, MD and Ashok Panigrahy, MD), placental physiology (Catherine Spong, MD and Dinesh Rakheja, MD),
and CHD (Mohammad Tarique Hussain, MD, PhD). The UTSW hospital system and its strong clinical research
operation are the ideal environment to conduct the proposed studies with their robust Fetal Heart Program, a
dedicated Center for Translational Medicine, and a strong record of clinical research participation. Dr. Leon’s
Career Development Plan includes a comprehensive strategy to address the specific key training goals that
will allow her to establish her research program, including 1) gaining expertise in advanced fetal brain and
placental MRI techniques and their correlation to pathophysiology, 2) developing expertise in the maturation of
cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms and analytical tools to evaluate these dynamic signals, and 3) developing
leadership skills for clinical research involving maternal-fetal dyads. Together with her scientific aims, these goals
will provide the skills necessary for Dr. Leon to build her independent research program in neuroplacentology."
10908347,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is a leading cause of in-hospital death in high-income countries, and it likewise causes a formidable
burden of disease in low-income countries, where in-hospital mortality for severe sepsis can exceed 60%.
Building upon Duke University’s strong collaborative clinical research platform in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, these
studies will use data-driven clustering methods and Bayesian latent class models to define clinically meaningful
subtypes of sepsis that are specific to the infectious disease epidemiology and population sub-structures of sub-
Saharan Africa (sSA). In doing so, we seek to advance the long-term goal of improving detection, risk
stratification and, eventually, tailored interventions for sepsis among adults in resource-limited settings. The
rationale driving this project is that sepsis subtype characterization holds great promise for improving the
evaluation, management and clinical investigation of sepsis in sSA. To perform our characterizations of adult
sepsis subtypes, we will leverage existing samples and data from our research platform’s 2016-2019 severe
febrile illness cohort to inform a two-year prospective observational study of sepsis admissions at district
hospitals in Kilimanjaro. By developing a precision medicine-based approach to classify the key pathophysiologic
subtypes of sepsis in sSA, this project promotes the US National Institutes of Health’s mission to uncover new
knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone—in this case, better health for the most severely ill in the
region with the highest burden of sepsis in the world. To achieve this, the project has set out SPECIFIC AIMS
that will develop clinical phenotype clusters of adult sepsis derived from clinical bioinformatics using Bayesian
statistics (Aim 1) as well as immunologic sepsis clusters based upon the molecular characterization of the host
immune response to infection (Aim 2). We will integrate the approaches in Aim 1 and Aim 2 in order to identify
robust and clinically meaningful subtypes of sepsis in Kilimanjaro (Aim 3). In Year 1, we will use the existing
samples and data collected 2016-2019 to develop and refine the statistical and analytical models for our Aims.
This will inform the analytical framework for the prospective sepsis patient cohort in Years 2-3, which will be the
basis for both derivation and validation of the clinical and molecular sepsis subtype classifications. The clinical
clusters and molecular characterizations discovered in Aim 1 and Aim 2 will also be compared to findings from
clinical bioinformatic and gene expression signature analyses that have described sepsis subtypes in Europe
and North America. The disease epidemiology of sepsis in sSA—high prevalence of advanced HIV infection and
more diverse sepsis etiologies—as well as potential host genetic differences compared to European and North
American sepsis patients necessitate that subtype identification be specifically derived and validated for
application in sSA. Not only will this project identify subtypes that improve triage and tailored intervention design
for sepsis in sSA—it will also establish a framework for sepsis research in a setting where the greatest
gains are needed and where the greatest improvements in sepsis outcomes can indeed be made."
10908348,"Cardiovascular (CV) events related to the receipt of potentially cardiotoxic anthracycline-based chemotherapy
(Anth-bC), are emerging as leading causes of morbidity and mortality for survivors of lymphoma (the 5th
most common cancer in North America). The objective of our proposal is to reduce this cancer treatment
related CV morbidity by developing, enabling, and testing a physical activity intervention that commences and
continues throughout receipt of Anth-bC for the purpose of attenuating physical inactivity, preserving exercise
capacity, CV & cognitive function, strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for those with lymphoma.
The need for and the design of this program is based in part on feedback from lymphoma survivor focus
groups treated in our NIH funded Comprehensive Cancer Center - preliminary pilot data (Section 3.C.1).
Several novel features of this proposal include:
1) Performance of physical activity during receipt of cancer treatment where exercise intolerance originates.
2) Creation of patient communities that enable cancer patients to support one another during treatment.
3) Administration of aerobic & strength activities suited to one's individual lifestyle in the home guided by
 instruction provided from 4 close to home cardiac rehabilitation facilities experienced in exercising
 immunocompromised individuals and those with other pre-existing activity limitations due to cancer.
4) Utilization of newly developed magnetic resonance cardiopulmonary exercise treadmill testing methods to
 measure the two components (cardiac function and peripheral factors) that contribute to peak VO2 (a
 measure of maximal exercise capacity). This new information will provide mechanistic insight into how
 physical activity helps preserve exercise capacity and reduce fatigue.
5) Assessment of the relationships between cognitive function, activity, and exercise capacity thereby helping
 to unravel the association between physical activity, HRQOL and cognitive function in cancer patients.
In this application, we propose to refine the physical activity intervention during the R21 Phase in patients who
participate in the intervention for 6 months. If suitable milestones are achieved, we will conduct a randomized
clinical trial in the R33 Phase to test the utility of the integrated physical activity intervention for sustaining peak
V02, 6-min walk distance, cardiac and cognitive function, strength, activity, and HRQOL.
If we achieve our study goals, this proposed intervention could reduce CV mortality and heart failure related
hospital admissions, translate into clinical practice via extension through cardiac rehabilitation centers (often
located close to cancer centers), increase health-related quality of life, reduce fatigue to perform activities of
daily living, and attenuate cognitive function decline in lymphoma survivors. The results of this study could help
to change existing sedentary behavior paradigms during receipt of chemotherapy and ultimately lead to
improved long term outcomes for those with lymphoma and potentially other forms of cancer."

both the internal and external community, including a searchable database to pair modelers with empiricists. 
We also facilitate several large projects within the University, across the State, and multi-state projects."
10909061,"Many of the outstanding problems in human health are unsolved because they involve complex processes. 
Despite remarkable advances in technology, the solutions will not be found by data alone. To seek solutions, 
we built a core centered on modeling. A good model gives insight into how a process works and, more 
importantly, how the process can be manipulated to promote human health. Modeling can serve as a common 
language to link disparate research areas; it improves research at every stage, from hypothesis formulation 
through analysis. Ultimately, modeling creates a positive feedback loop with empirical approaches, deepening 
scientific exploration and discovery. During Phase I, we established the Modeling Core centered on a group of 
Core Fellows: postdocs with diverse modeling expertise. Our Core is unique. In contrast to many other centers 
that focus on a single biomedical problem, we apply modeling to many biomedical problems and, for each of 
these, can bring multiple types of modeling to bear. Our Core is agile. We can modify our expertise based on 
the needs of the Center and of the community. Our Core is catalytic. We have shaped interdisciplinary 
research in tangible ways: providing modeling expertise to empiricists, growing areas of modeling with high 
impact, and increasing the number of collaborative proposals and publications. Building on this upward 
trajectory, our overarching goal is to enhance biomedical discovery across the University and the State by 
integrating modeling into research via three aims. (1) Support individual Research Projects by engaging in 
integrative modeling. We achieve this by ensuring that each project has significant effort from a Fellow, and 
through our Core Initiative on machine learning that will benefit the projects directly. (2) Extend the Modeling 
Core into emerging research directions. The purpose of this aim is to anticipate and respond to the modeling 
needs of the research community. This will be accomplished by hiring Fellows in new areas of modeling, by 
giving current Fellows development opportunities, and by establishing two new Core Initiatives, one in machine 
learning and one in geospatial modeling. (3) Expand the impact of the Modeling Core across the University and 
State by recruiting more researchers in additional fields. The purpose of this aim is to grow the number of 
participants to support the long-term sustainability of the Core and the Center. This will be accomplished 
primarily by embedding Core Fellows in interdisciplinary teams, as well as by offering Modeling Access Grants 
and training workshops. Completion of these aims will lead to a stronger Core that supports modeling efforts 
and improves biomedical research in Idaho. This will move us closer to our long-term goal of building a 
sustainable Center."
10909069,"Amino acid mutations in human visual pigments can impair color vision or lead to diseases such as degenerative blinding condition. Human vision requires that these pigments, consisting of a chromophore and associated opsin protein, have distinct peak spectral sensitivities in separate rod and cone photoreceptor populations. Peak spectral sensitivity is determined by the chromophore type and the amino acid sequence of the opsin. Understanding how a single mutation in the opsin protein can lead to anomalous visual function and disease would assist the development of molecular-level therapeutic strategies. Such an understanding is currently not available. The proposed research has an overarching goal of developing novel molecular-level therapeutic strategies to treat human vision deficiencies by unraveling the mysteries of the phototransduction cycle using state-of-the-art modeling approaches. The goal of the proposed research is to build on our molecular modeling framework to develop and test an automated computational pipeline to estimate peak spectral sensitivity for Rh1 rod opsins and use it to elucidate mechanisms for disease-associated mutations. In Aim 1, we will build a machine-learning-based pipeline, which will utilize homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation, for accurately predicting peak spectral sensitivity from opsin amino acid sequence data. Aim 2 will employ mixed quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics simulations to elucidate molecular mechanisms of spectral shift and improve the pipeline. In Aim 3, we will use the pipeline to determine molecular mechanisms for anomalous visual functions. The proposed research has the potential for high impact in the field of human vision because it will provide a predictive modeling approach for visual pigments, that has remained elusive for decades. This new genome-to-phenome understanding of the molecular function of visual pigments will pave the way for novel strategies to engineer pigments suitable for optogenetics, or to develop targeted therapeutic strategies."
10909070,"The microbial communities colonizing animals are integral to animal health and development but details 
about what make these communities functional and stable are lacking. Bacteriophages (viruses that infect 
bacteria) are the numerically dominant members of animal microbiomes and they influence many 
properties of these communities. Bacteriophages regulate bacterial community composition by predation, 
transfer genetic material between host genomes, and beneficially stimulate the immune system of animals. 
However, our knowledge of bacteriophages is largely restricted to a limited set of lab-adapted strains and 
thus our understanding of their role in animal microbiomes is lacking. Bacteriophages may influence 
disease through ecological processes by regulating bacterial community composition and abundance or by promoting changes in the virulence of their bacterial hosts. 
The factors causing microbial composition to change over time are often hard to determine and empirically test because most animal microbiomes are complex and experimental intractable. We propose to utilize an important animal model system, the honey bee (Apis mellifera), to determine how ecological and evolutionary forces shape animal microbiomes. To this end, we outline two Aims that will help us 
characterize these forces. 
Aim 1: Determine how phage resistance evolution is dependent on microbial growth conditions. In this aim 
we will comprehensively test different parameters of growth than are likely to influence how quickly 
bacteria evolve resistance against bacteriophage infections. We will carefully measure the tempo of 
change in sets of bacteria and phages growing together. We anticipate identifying how these dynamics are impacted by growth conditions. 
Aim 2: Measure the impact of microbial interactions on phage resistance evolution dynamics. In this aim 
we expand our research to include interacting bacterial species. In most natural conditions that microbes 
live in they will encounter other bacteria. These interactions likely alter how bacteria respond to and evolveresistance against the bacteriophages that infect them. Our experiments will address this by co-culturing bacteria and again measuring the tempo of evolution in these systems. 
In both aims we adopt an integrative approach that utilizes mathematic modeling, culturing of bacteria and phages in the lab, and testing their growth in the honey bee gut. In doing so, we benefit from the strengths of each approach and increase the rigor of our results."
10909102,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
Our thriving Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction Research (NaPDI Center) has achieved
tremendous success in establishing rigorous and definitive approaches for the design and conduct of natural
product (NP)-drug interaction (NPDI) studies and advancing our understanding of pharmacokinetic NPDIs
precipitated by four carefully selected high priority NPs: green tea, goldenseal, cannabis, and kratom. The
success of the NaPDI Center reflects multiple inter-institutional and intra-institutional collaborations that worked
effectively and efficiently with logistical, fiscal, and intellectual support provided by the Administrative Core. Roles
and responsibilities of the Administrative Core are integrated into all NaPDI Center activities, at both the
programmatic and project levels, ensuring that prescribed project milestones are met and within budget.
Accomplishments of the Administrative Core derive from a lean leadership structure and regular, effective
communication between Center investigators. As detailed in this renewal application, we propose three SPECIFIC
AIMS that represent a continuation of existing Core functions with multiple innovations. AIM 1: the Administrative
Core will coordinate project activities of the investigators composing the three scientific Cores (Pharmacology,
Analytical, and Informatics) and their associated academic institutions, ensuring maximal scientific productivity
and fiscal cohesion. The Administrative Core will partner with NCCIH to establish a Steering Committee that 1)
oversees the NaPDI Center program, 2) monitors progress of the Interaction Projects and expansion of the data
repository and public portal, and 3) recommends changes in scientific direction when warranted. In addition, the
Administrative Core will ensure effective communication between Center investigators and the External Advisory
Panel by providing regular updates of project progress and tapping the Panel’s wealth of expertise in relevant
disciplines to inform strategic directions of the Center and help address specific project challenges. AIM 2: the
Administrative Core will work with the Informatics Core to develop and implement innovative metrics to evaluate
program success, completion of annual milestones, and impact of specific project outcomes on the scientific field
and public health and safety. AIM 3: the Administrative Core will provide leadership for the broad dissemination
of best practice methodologies and recommended approaches developed by the Center for the optimal conduct
of human mechanistic in vitro and clinical NPDI studies. These activities will include innovative approaches to
broaden outreach to national and international scientific communities. Our time-tested administrative team has
developed a highly effective operational paradigm that will ensure continued productivity of the Center and
translation of Center-generated data to improve public health."
10909103,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE PHARMACOLOGY CORE
Sales of botanical and other natural products (NPs) continue to rise exponentially, increasing concerns for
adverse interactions between NPs and concomitant prescription medications. During the first four-plus years of
our Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction Research (NaPDI Center), the Pharmacology
Core established a framework for the selection, prioritization, and evaluation of high impact NPs as precipitants
of potential clinically significant pharmacokinetic NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) that could lead to suboptimal
therapeutic outcomes. We adopted a rigorous, systematic ‘predict, learn, and confirm’ approach involving robust
human-relevant in vitro systems, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation, and clinical evaluation to assess the
clinical relevance of NPDIs. The Pharmacology Core component of this renewal application proposes three
SPECIFIC AIMS that refine and extend the ‘best practices’ developed during the initial funding period. AIM 1: the
Pharmacology Core, in collaboration with the Analytical Core, Informatics Core, Administrative Core, and
Steering Committee, will select and prioritize three to five widely used NPs as precipitants of potential clinically
significant NPDIs using our established method termed the fulcrum model. Based on our experience to date, we
have expanded this innovative model to include a fast track option that accommodates emerging NPs with
heightened NPDI risk to remain responsive to public health needs. The following high priority NPs are proposed:
kratom, hemp products, cinnamon, black pepper supplement, and the combination product Echinacea
purpurea/goldenseal. AIM 2: the Pharmacology Core will evaluate the NPDI liability of these NPs using
established human in vitro systems for both drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter activity and in vitro to in
vivo extrapolation approaches recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. AIM 3: the Pharmacology
Core will evaluate the clinical NPDI risk in healthy volunteers that will include a more vulnerable, elderly
population. The rationale for targeting the latter group is that specific NPs are increasingly marketed to the aging
population, often claiming fewer side effects than prescription medications. The Pharmacology Core’s clinical
research capabilities are a cornerstone of the NaPDI Center, having completed five clinical studies during the
initial funding period. Throughout the proposed project, NPs that emerge from companion R21 grants will be
applied to our expanded fulcrum model and potentially advanced to our NP list. We will continually integrate new
clinical research methods, such as evaluating the effects of the gut microbiota and incorporating transporter
probe cocktails and biomarkers of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The Pharmacology Core, in
synergy with the other Cores of the NaPDI Center, has efficiently and definitively established a new standard for
NPDI research. Capitalizing on the momentum of our world class team, we are confident to continue this
trajectory by innovating additional recommended approaches for NPDI research and identifying novel clinically
relevant NPDIs."
10909105,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE ANALYTICAL CORE
A central challenge in studying botanical and other natural products (NPs) is their inherent complexity and
variability. Unlike conventional drugs, NPs are mixtures, for which chemical composition is not fully known and
may vary depending on the genetics of the source material and how they are grown and processed. Unless it is
carefully accounted for, such variability can confound in vitro and clinical studies of NPs. The overarching
objective of the Analytical Core is to support rigorous and reproducible Interaction Studies for our Center of
Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction Research (NaPDI Center). Critical to this endeavor will be
ensuring that NP study material is authentic (genus and species correctly identified), free of contaminants, and
well-characterized for dosage performance and stability. Study material will be chosen from commercially
available products with careful consideration of consumer trends, chemical profile, and product quality. Another
important function of the Analytical Core will be to provide isolated NP constituents with defined structure and
purity in support of mechanistic in vitro studies to be conducted by the Pharmacology Core. Finally, we will work
with the Pharmacology Core to quantify object drugs/metabolites, NP constituents, and drug metabolizing
enzyme and transporter biomarkers in pharmacokinetic samples obtained from clinical NP-drug interaction
(NPDI) studies. These goals will be accomplished by employing methodologies established during the current
funding cycle, including application of both targeted, quantitative liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry
methods and untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics. Our rigorous workflow was recently published in a
high impact review article in Natural Product Reports. An innovative aspect of the studies proposed for the
renewal application will be the use of metabolomics to characterize the intestinal absorption of constituents from
complex NPs. These studies will be conducted using an established human intestinal in vitro model (Caco-2 cell
monolayers) and by characterizing human samples (plasma, urine, and feces) obtained from clinical NPDI
studies conducted by the Pharmacology Core. Importantly, the research findings generated in studies conducted
by the Analytical Core will be shared via a customized portal designed by the Informatics Core specifically to
disseminate NaPDI Center-generated data to research communities. The Analytical Core consists of a team of
scientists with an extensive track record in research collaboration, including multiple co-authored publications
relevant to NPDI studies published with investigators from the Pharmacology Core and Informatics Core. The
collective natural products chemistry and bioanalytical expertise of the Analytical Core investigators ensures
accomplishment of the milestones set forth for this Core, thereby helping to advance the understanding of NPDIs
and their clinical relevance."
10909109,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE INFORMATICS CORE
Natural product (NP)-drug interaction (NPDI) research spans several disciplines that include sourcing and
characterizing candidate NP materials (Analytical Core), in vitro and clinical assessment of NPDI liability
(Pharmacology Core), and data dissemination (Informatics Core). The existing Center of Excellence for NPDI
Research (NaPDI Center), currently in its fifth successful year, consists of world-renowned experts in each of
these areas and provides leadership for NPDI research. The Informatics Core has created a cloud-based data
repository that provides a secure workflow for manual NPDI study data entry and publishing. The repository is a
leading example of how to make NPDI data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The long-
term sustainability of the data repository is dependent on its usefulness to relevant stakeholders. The Informatics
Core component of this renewal application proposes three SPECIFIC AIMS that refine the data repository and
expand the informatics power of the NaPDI Center. AIM 1: The Core will add features to the data repository to
increase its usefulness for a growing community of NPDI researchers, including companion R21 grantees. Such
features include a streamlined external data submission process based on simple-to-use data entry forms and
web services that use a common data format. New data summaries and visualizations will provide researchers
a complete evidence-based overview of each NP’s potential to precipitate pharmacokinetic NPDIs. AIM 2: The
Pharmacology Core previously developed a highly effective and robust method, termed the fulcrum model, for
selecting and prioritizing NPs as potential precipitants of NPDIs. Application of this novel model is currently a
time-consuming manual task. The Informatics Core will innovate the fulcrum model by developing an informatics-
based method to expedite the collection and summarization of data needed to apply the fulcrum model, providing
an automated and continual appraisal of high priority NPs to the Center and external NP researchers. The Core
will also innovate the identification of NPs by generating pharmacovigilance signal data for NPs using data from
poison center reports and two FDA adverse event reporting systems. This new feature will provide researchers
with important insight into the types of reported adverse events and concomitant exposures involving NPs. AIM
3: The Informatics Core will broaden the usage and utility of the data repository for both the research community
and clinical practice stakeholders. To capture scientists across the spectrum of disciplines in NPDI research, we
will expand our marketing strategy. To capture clinical practice stakeholders who consider potential NPDIs during
medication ordering and reconciliation activities, we will design NPDI clinical decision support artifacts and
services through a user-centered approach inspired by recent advances in decision support for potential drug-
drug interactions. Accomplishment of these aims will result in a learning NPDI research system that will improve
public health by helping patients avoid NPDIs."
10909133,"The Administrative (Admin) Core is responsible for establishing, sustaining, and shaping the growth and
development of the Center. The Core oversees: (1) Center strategic planning, (2) scientific leadership and
oversight to ensure quality and productivity of the Signature, Exploratory (R34-size), and Pilot Feasibility (R03-
size) research projects; (3) logistical and administrative support to the Center components, and (4) facilitation of
a network of Consortium Partner stakeholders affiliated with the Center. Specific aims of the Admin Core are to:
 1. Facilitate research on scalable and sustainable approaches to suicide prevention at justice intercepts
 (defined as places where behavioral health services can intercept a justice trajectory to change
 behavioral health [and justice] outcomes),1 addressing the #1 goal of the National Strategy for Suicide
 Prevention (to integrate care across systems within communities).
 2. Foster synergy among research disciplines and cores and support research projects
 3. Oversee solicitation, review, and selection of 4-6 additional innovative pilot studies that capitalize on
 center resources and extend the research program
 4. Support training opportunities
 5. Communicate the Center’s aims and activities
 6. Oversee evaluation activities
 7. Plan for sustainment of Center effects
The Admin Core is assisted in these activities by a leadership team that is experienced in the administration of
large, multi-component research programs, Center-dedicated administrative support, and a strong and diverse
group of collaborators and Consortium Partners. Consortium Partners include governmental, practice, policy,
and community partners (including individuals with lived experience and their families). The Center brings
together health system, justice system, and suicide prevention communities, constituencies who do not regularly
work together, to create novel solutions to a common problem. When system fragmentation is the crux of the
problem, bringing all the key players together is a crucial first step, as highlighted in our unifying Center model
(the Sequential Intercept Model). The Center will drive innovation by bringing together transdisciplinary expertise
which does not usually co-exist to create synergies that would not exist without the Center to address suicide
prevention at justice intercepts. The Center is tightly organized (Table 1), with timelines and milestones (Table
2), and a plan for accountability of and support provided to Center Cores and research projects. The goal is to
change practice and policy for justice-involved individuals in order to contribute to near-term reductions in the
U.S. suicide rate."
10909135,"The Methods Core supports a Signature Project, 3 Exploratory Projects, and 4-6 Pilot Feasibility Projects
focused on health-justice big data linkage to enable effective and scalable suicide prevention approaches at
justice intercepts (i.e., places behavioral health services can intercept a justice trajectory to change behavioral

conceptual frameworks, methods, and measures. Center Methods are innovative in that they:
 1. Establish a suicide prevention effectiveness evidence base for our large, high-risk target population.
 2. Create an n~110,000 combined Center dataset that will be diverse and will be an asset to the field.
 3. Develop, manualize, and refine strategies for scalability, sustainability, and large-scale translation, to
 move the field forward for these important but understudied areas of implementation science.
 4. Use contact with the justice system (e.g., police contact, arrest), as a novel indicator of suicide risk in the
 general population (i.e., a “novel data type”) to identify at-risk individuals not well-connected with care
 5. Demonstrate how health and justice system big data linkage is achieved and can be used to automate
 and conduct suicide risk identification and response across health and justice systems at scale.
 6. Leverage the Mental Health Research Network’s (MHRN’s) methods for extracting suicide-related and
 healthcare utilization outcomes from claims and electronic health record (EHR) data.
 7. Use sociometric identification of policy entrepreneurs to promote diffusion of Center approaches (Aim 4)
 8. Partner with managed care organizations for suicide risk identification and prevention at justice intercepts
 9. Convene health, justice, and suicide prevention communities, constituencies who do not often work
 together, to create novel solutions to a common problem.
The Methods Core supports the Center through the following Specific Aims:
 1. Engage Consortium Partners, promoting utility, uptake, scalability, & sustainability of Center findings
 2. Incubate and generate innovative approaches to suicide prevention
 3. Facilitate design and conduct of Center research projects, including transforming Center projects into
 Hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies to promote scalability and sustainability of interventions
 4. Disseminate Center methods and solutions and build national capacity for justice, health, and suicide
 prevention cross-system research
 5. Evaluate the Center’s processes, progress, productivity and impact
The Center is designed to shorten the translational pipeline through scalable solutions, hybrid trials, strong
stakeholder integration, and a strong dissemination plan. Strong integration of Methods Core Work Streams
and stakeholder perspectives will advance Center public health impact."
10909137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As suicide rates in the United States continue to rise, with nearly 50,000 suicide deaths and over 1 million
suicide attempts annually per most recent data, increased attention has been paid to how to best integrate and
coordinate suicide risk identification and prevention across multiple sectors, where some of our most vulnerable
community members “fall through the cracks” in the continuum of care. Perhaps nowhere is this need for
coordination and integration more pronounced than at the intersection of the US jail system, with over 10 million
admissions per year, and the community healthcare system; an intercept known to impact individuals at
disproportionately high risk for suicide. Given that roughly 10% of all suicides in the US with known
circumstances occur following a recent criminal legal stressor (often arrest and jail detention), reducing suicide
risk in the year after jail detention could have a noticeable impact on national suicide rates. There is thus a vital
need to develop suicide risk care pathways between jails and healthcare systems to offer immediate access to
care. Yet this process has been stymied by major fissures in the integration of data and clinical information
between jails and health systems, preventing effective coordination of care between these community sectors.
To address these needs, the proposed Signature Project is a Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial
that harmonizes local jail booking and release data with healthcare records at two large healthcare systems in
Minnesota and Michigan, to identify health system patients who are released from jail, and to pair the data
linkage with randomization into usual care or a multi-level health system suicide prevention care pathway
(consisting of care coordination, Safety Planning, Caring Contacts, and a telehealth delivered Coping Long-
Term with Active Suicide Program). In so doing, this project leverages the study team’s experience in health
system data linkage in the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, from which the participating
healthcare systems were chosen, as well as in suicide prevention around the period of jail detention and
release (i.e., in the SPIRIT Trial), and in telephone-based suicide prevention intervention (i.e., in ED-SAFE).
The proposed project will randomize 1050 individuals into the 5S intervention at both sites (comparing to more
than 60,000 people in a usual care no contact comparison arm). Findings on suicide attempt and death
outcomes, healthcare utilization mechanisms, cost- effectiveness, and implementation factors will provide data
for a future fully scaled implementation trial and widespread adoption in community settings. Notably, the
proposed Signature Project will be the first trial of a comprehensive health system intervention to prevent
suicide in response to patients’ justice involvement."
10938652,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T, are engineered white blood cells from patients that can destroy
cancer. CAR T has the potential to cure several blood cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma. However,
side effects of CAR T, called cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, can cause life-threatening
problems with patients’ blood pressure, breathing, and brain. We developed a system to identify patients at risk
of severe CRS and neurotoxicity by measuring two simple blood tests, CRP and ferritin, well before the CAR T
are even given. We now propose a new approach to prevent CRS and neurotoxicity among those patients at
greatest risk of CRS and neurotoxicity. This entails treating these high-risk patients with two prophylactic
medications, dexamethasone and anakinra, before they show any signs of CAR T toxicity. In smaller studies,
prophylactic dexamethasone or anakinra have been shown to be safe and offer strong signals of success in
preventing CRS or neurotoxicity after CAR T. They have not yet been studied as a combination in this setting.
Our proposed trial will be a large study of 182 patients who receive either dexamethasone plus anakinra or a
placebo within the first few days of receiving CAR T. We will closely monitor patients for signs of CRS and/or
neurotoxicity within the first 30 days of CAR T therapy, when this risk is the greatest. It is important to highlight
that Hispanic patients are at 3 times greater risk for severe CRS, compared to White non-Hispanic patients. We
will specifically investigate whether preventative dexamethasone and anakinra reduces the risk of such severe
toxicity among Hispanic patients, and improve CAR T health equity. Work in the lab also suggests that preventing
CRS and neurotoxicity will not only help to make CAR T therapy safer, but possibly more effective against cancer
too. Research from our group shows that preventing CRS and neurotoxicity prevents the patient’s immune
system from impairing CAR T function via a metabolite called arginine. We expect that successful completion of
this project will facilitate safe CAR T therapy and possibly improve curative outcomes for treated cancer patients."
10939218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma is characterized by chronic, non-resolving lung inflammation; however, there are endogenous inhibitory
mechanisms that normally promote the resolution of lung inflammation. The long-term objective of our research
is to understand the bronchial epithelial cell (BEC)-mediated inhibition of lung inflammation in asthma.
Transmembrane protein 178 (Tmem178) mediates a novel endogenous inhibitory mechanism in asthma. Our
preliminary data showed that TMEM178 gene expression in BECs decreased as asthma severity increased. In
addition, we found that Tmem178 inhibits adenosine triphosphate- and allergen-induced [Ca2+]i responses, store-
operated calcium entry (SOCE), and interleukin (IL)-33 release in BECs. Furthermore, the genetic loss of
Tmem178 led to more severe lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway collagen deposition
in a murine model of asthma. Finally, we identified TMEM178 variants associated with severe clinical phenotypes
in asthma patients. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the Tmem178-mediated endogenous
inhibitory mechanism in BECs is dysregulated in asthma, resulting in downstream lung inflammation, AHR, and
tissue remodeling. In this project, we will test this hypothesis by complementary approaches using BEC cultures
and mouse models of asthma together with whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and clinical data from
diverse asthma cohorts.
In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that Tmem178-mediated inhibition of calcium responses is disrupted in
asthmatic BECs. We will analyze calcium imaging from normal and asthmatic BECs and organotypic cultures of
normal and asthmatic BECs. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the targeted genetic loss of Tmem178 in
epithelial cells results in more severe lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway collagen
deposition. We will analyze Tmem178fl/flShhCre mice in a murine model of asthma. In Aim 3, we will test the
hypothesis that TMEM178 variants are associated with TMEM178 expression and [Ca2+]i responses in BECs
and severe asthma phenotypes in patients. We will analyze existing whole-genome sequencing, RNA
sequencing, and clinical data from diverse asthma cohorts, and use CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate and study
TMEM178 variants in BECs. The results of our proposed research will characterize the role of Tmem178 in BECs
and asthma pathogenesis, thereby providing a rationale for the development of novel therapies to resolve
inflammation in the asthmatic lung."

Title: Chemical labeling strategies using biomolecule-compatible, nonaqueous media
Abstract:
 Among many classes of chemical tools devised to date, protein bioconjugation
technologies have proven valuable in a wide variety of contexts such as preparation of
therapeutic agents and study of disease mechanism The last decade has witnessed a
substantial advance in bioconjugation technologies, although challenges of selective and
efficient labeling have not been completely addressed to date for many of the 20 canonical
amino acids. Our research program tackles the longstanding issues of selective
bioconjugation of unactivated amino acids by identifying nonaqueous media suitable for both
biomolecules and organic chemistry reactions, which has not been actively pursued to date
and is innovative from the applicant’s point of view. Our long-term goal is to develop
bioconjugation methods selectively targeting amino acids that were inaccessible by previous
approaches in aqueous media. Our overall objective in this application is to discover
chemical methods for chemoselective functionalization of hydrophobic, unactivated, and
less abundant amino acids, offering higher chance of site-specific modification due to their
lower natural abundance and less surface exposure. Our central hypothesis is that
nonaqueous media can be compatible with proteins and induce chemical reactions that were
not achievable in aqueous medium. The rationale for the proposal is that development of
novel bioconjugation methods is expected to become facile by gaining access to a large
number of synthetic methodology literature that often relies on nonaqueous media. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a chemical tool to target
amino acid residues that were inaccessible by the traditional methods and to provide a new
paradigm to create bioconjugates."

The most common malignancy for men in the western world is Prostate cancer (PCa), with a predicted 288,300
new cases and 34,700 specific deaths in 2023. With recent developments in comprehensive screening and
biopsy strategies, the ten-year survival rate of PCa is largely improved to 98% and the disease specific
mortality is reduced to only 4-8%. However, the widespread adoption of these strategies has also led to
significant overtreatment of the disease, leading to a significant loss in patient quality of life with an added
financial burden of 22 billion dollars annually in the U.S. alone. To better detect and guide biopsies, non-
invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an informative, accompanying tool along with the
Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), an internationally established scoring system for
characterizing the risk of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in focal lesions detected on MRI. While aiming to
defer biopsies for low-risk patients whenever possible, ~30% of patients with a negative MRI still end up
proceeding to biopsy due to suboptimal negative predictive values with current MRI techniques (~90%). This
leads to unnecessary biopsies and post-procedure complications for a population in which the prevalence of
csPCa is only around 8%. The majority of detected PCa (70%) is localized in the peripheral zone of the
prostate. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel, non-invasive imaging techniques to improve our capability to
more definitively rule out csPCa in the peripheral zone of the prostate to avoid unnecessary biopsies,
complications, and costs. Our team has pioneered the prostate Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF)
technique, which simultaneously quantifies T1 and T2 in ~40 sec per slice. We propose to develop a rapid and
reproducible MRF method to quantitatively and more accurately characterize prostatic peripheral zone tissue in
order to limit overdiagnosis and overtreatment for patients with no csPCa. We will develop novel prostate MRF
techniques to provide simultaneous and motion-robust T1, T2, and diffusion quantification (Aim 1). Rapid and
whole-gland imaging will be achieved by leveraging novel deep learning techniques and multi-slice imaging.
Deep-learning-based prostate segmentation derived from MRF signal evolutions will be further developed to
automatically extract quantitative metrics from the peripheral zone for post-processing (Aim 2). These
developed methods will be applied in a diagnostic study of a population with clinical indication for a biopsy to
assess its capability to more accurately inform biopsy decision (Aim 3). Upon successful development, this
MRF-based method will provide more quantitative tissue assessment of the prostate, optimizing biopsy
avoidance in patients with a negative MRI."
10940110,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite advances in high-throughput screening technologies, initial hits require extensive optimization by
medicinal chemistry to yield molecules with the potency and selectivity needed for biological applications,
creating a significant bottleneck in small molecule drug discovery and chemical probe development efforts. In
this R35 MIRA proposal, I outline my research program consisting of two complementary research directions
aimed at expanding the scope of methodologies for chemical probe development toward underexplored
biological targets and, ultimately, accelerating drug discovery. Research A is focused on improving the
throughput of medicinal chemistry by expanding our first-of-its-kind high-throughput medicinal chemistry (HTMC)
platform, which is based on Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) click-chemistry reactions. Although I
previously demonstrated successful application of my HTMC platform to several well-characterized model
proteins, additional work is needed to enable targeting of underexplored proteins, including those that lack
distinct binding sites. In this research, we will address the challenge of developing chemical probes against
underexplored proteins by coupling our platform with a covalent ligand approach, both at the target protein level
(A1) and in a proteome-wide manner (A2). Successful completion of this work will expand the biological targets
accessible to our HTMC workflow, thereby accelerating probe development against underexplored proteins and
enabling elucidation of their biological functions and roles in human health and disease. In Research B, we will
develop strategies for synthesis and evaluation of subcellular location selective–probes. Modulation of small
molecule subcellular distribution, introduced by Christian de Duve in the 1970s, remains a promising yet
underexplored strategy in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, largely due to the technical challenge of
developing subcellular-selective chemical probes. Our long-term goal is to establish a comprehensive medicinal
chemistry workflow to develop subcellular-selective probes and drugs. In this grant period, we will develop a
SuFEx-enabled method for extracellular-selective chemical probe synthesis (B1), demonstrate approaches to
assess organelle-selective target engagement (B2), and explore the potential of modulating organelle selectivity
as a medicinal chemistry strategy to improve cellular potency (B3). Development of chemical probes with
subcellular resolution will overcome a longstanding hurdle in medicinal chemistry and provide crucial insights
into spatio-specific protein functions in disease mechanisms. In total, the workflows and approaches that result
from the proposed research program will accelerate and expand the scope of chemical probe development in a
proteome-wide and spatio-defined manner, fundamentally advancing the fields of chemical biology and medicinal
chemistry. Application of the developed technologies and chemical probes will enhance our understanding of
living systems and provide proof-of-concept for novel therapeutic mechanisms of action to support drug
development efforts."
10911047,"The most common chronic diarrheal disease in this country and in veterans is inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD; e.g. Crohn’s disease). Diarrhea is the most common and disabling morbidity of IBD. The available
treatments for diarrhea of IBD are suboptimal, non-specific and fraught with many side effects. Diarrhea in
these conditions is a result of electrolyte (e.g. Na, Cl) and fluid malabsorption by absorptive villus cells and
enhanced secretion by secretory crypt cells. Immune inflammatory mediators (e.g. prostaglandins), known to
be elevated in the mucosa of the chronically inflamed intestine, are paramount factors altering the activity of
epithelial electrolyte transporters. While the concept of immune regulation of electrolyte transport in IBD is fairly
well accepted, specifically which of the many immune inflammatory pathways may regulate coupled NaCl
absorption to cause diarrhea in IBD is poorly understood. The existing paradigm is that coupled NaCl
absorption occurs via the dual operation of Na:H (NHE3) and Cl:HCO3 exchange (DRA). But our studies in
multiple IBD models showing that NHE3 is unaffected, raised an important question of what other Na
absorptive pathway may be affected in tandem with DRA that results in coupled NaCl malabsorption leading to
the most common and disabling symptom of IBD, diarrhea. Of the other potential major Na absorptive
processes that may be coupled to Cl:HCO3 exchange is Na-glucose co-transport (SGLT1) on the villus cell
BBM. SGLT1 is pivotal not only for the absorption of the major nutrient glucose, but also plays a critical role in
maintaining overall fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by absorbing two Na for each glucose. Indeed,
preliminary data in two animal models of IBD and in human IBD demonstrated inhibition of SGLT1, in parallel
with DRA, albeit via different mechanisms. Further, preliminary studies showed that prostaglandins, key
immune inflammatory mediators, may be specific modulators of SGLT1 during chronic enteritis. These
observations, have led to the paradigm shifting conclusion, that in the chronically inflamed intestine it is not the
conventional coupled NaCl absorption via NHE3/DRA that is affected, but rather a novel DRA/SGLT1 coupled
absorptive pathway that may be inhibited to cause diarrhea in IBD. Given this background, the overall
hypothesis of this competing renewal proposal is that altered novel DRA/SGLT1 coupled NaCl absorption,
likely regulated by PGs, causes the diarrhea in IBD. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of regulation of SGLT1 and DRA by immune-inflammatory mediators in the chronically
inflamed intestine. We will comprehensively and complementarily study molecular and physiological regulation
of SGLT1 in vivo in rabbits with chronic enteritis and ex vivo in human small intestinal organoid 2-D
monolayers. Outcome of the proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into the cause of
impaired absorption of both electrolytes (NaCl) and nutrient (glucose) in the IBD intestine and yield clinically
relevant data which will be important to design effective and specific therapies for the most common
complication of IBD, chronic diarrhea."
10911053,"Partnership in Cancer Research (PCAR) seeks to provide first and second-year medical students an
innovative hands-on cancer research experience in a laboratory, clinical, or community setting. The PCAR
experience will serve a class of 12 participants for 10 weeks during the summer. The research experience will
be enriched by team-based learning on the molecular and cell biology of cancer alongside clinical simulations
and experiences of cancer screening, treatment, and palliation. The overarching goal of the cancer research
experiences is to spark the participants’ interest in future careers as cancer clinical specialists and
researchers. The program will enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral,
and clinical research needs.
 Individual cancer research projects are where the students spend most of their time. The research will be
put into context with weekly active learning sessions on the biology of cancer. Clinical experiences will expose
participants to current issues in the treatment and ongoing care of people with cancer; this aspect will also give
participants insight into how basic and community-engaged science affect clinical practice and how clinical
problems can be turned into research questions. The entrepreneurship program features teams of 3
participants independently proposing marketable cancer research solutions through weekly sessions with
entrepreneur mentors. The aims are to:
 1) Provide individual medical students an outstanding hands-on experience in cancer research.
Students will perform research with one of about 50 different faculty members performing cancer research in
basic science, clinical research, or community engaged research. Throughout the course, teams of
participants will integrate their research experiences and ideas in the online and in-person mentored “Cure
Cancer Entrepreneurship program” .
 2) Provide context for participants’ research with team-based learning and clinical exposures.
Weekly team-based learning sessions will engage students in learning detailed information on molecular and
cellular biology of cancer, as well as principles of community based medicine. Clinical exposure includes
hands-on medical simulations of cancer related topics, social media interaction with a moderated patient
support group, and a visit to the palliative care clinic that will take up no more than 2 hours per week.
 3) Determine program outcomes through rigorous evaluation. Pre and post testing will be used to
determine students gain in cancer research knowledge. Surveys will be used to evaluate all aspects of the
course content, faculty, and activities. Long term tracking of participants and similar sized cohort of medical
students who did not participate in PCAR will be used to investigate efficacy in influencing career choice in
cancer research."
10911061,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health problem associated with high risk of morbidity and
mortality. Due to impaired kidney acid excretion, up to 35% of patients with CKD develop metabolic acidosis.
Such individuals are often treated with sodium bicarbonate to prevent acidosis-induced bone demineralization
and muscle catabolism and preserve kidney function. However, sodium bicarbonate may also cause
cardiovascular harm in two main ways. One is by causing sodium and fluid retention leading to increased blood
pressure. While individual trials have not shown a substantial increase in body weight or blood pressure, a
meta-analysis found that sodium bicarbonate treatment was associated with higher risks of escalating
antihypertensive or diuretic therapy. High blood pressure and elevated markers of volume overload, including
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
mortality. Yet, it is unclear what effect, if any, sodium bicarbonate has on hormones that regulate sodium levels
and plasma volume. A major goal of this project is to determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate treatment on
levels of natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP and atrial natriuretic peptide) and components of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone) in individuals with CKD. Another major
cardiovascular concern is that sodium bicarbonate may promote vascular calcification. This has been observed
in animal models but has been incompletely investigated in humans. A second major goal of this project is to
determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate on blood levels of inhibitors, promoters and other indices of
vascular calcification (fetuin A, fibroblast growth factor-23, osteoprotegerin, bone morphogenic protein-2,
calciprotein particle 2 size, and the propensity of serum to calcify [T50]) in individuals with CKD. These goals
will be achieved by combining data and performing measurements using stored samples obtained from 395
participants in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sodium bicarbonate studies conducted in
the US. Measurements will be performed at baseline, 3- and 6-months. Change from baseline between the
placebo and sodium bicarbonate treatment groups will be determined and mediating effects of these changes
in response to treatment will be investigated using longtitudinal structural equation modeling. Although sodium
bicarbonate may slow the progression of CKD, there is concern about the long-term cardiovascular safety of
sodium bicarbonate. This proposal will investigate mechanisms involved with two main cardiovascular
concerns, fluid retention and vascular calcification, and potentially identify individuals who may be prone to
these adverse effects. These issues are large and clinically important knowledge gaps in the field. The results
will have a high impact on the field and will inform clinicians and investigators about the potential for
cardiovascular harm with sodium bicarbonate treatment."
10911067,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA damage is a constant threat to our genome. Our body has evolved a surveillance mechanism, namely the
DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, to protect our cells from genotoxic insults. Defective DDR pathway leads
to unfaithful repair of DNA breaks which results in accumulation of mutations, chromosome rearrangement, and
genome instability. Although much is known about how chromatin senses and responds to DNA damage, a
significant gap in knowledge exists with the poorly characterized mechanism by which damaged chromatin
transduces the signal to recruit effector proteins to DNA breaks. Such knowledge is imperative to understand
how cells precisely execute the correct pathway by recruiting the right repair protein complex in a temporal and
spatial manner which is essential for maintaining our genome integrity. This research program aims to address
this fundamental question in the chromatin-based DDR pathway. Our expertise lies in genome editing, functional
proteomics, molecular biology, cell biology, and biochemistry. We combine our techniques of protein purification,
confocal microscopy, laser-induced single cell micro-irradiation, cell-based reporter assays, protein tagging, and
quantitative mass spectrometry for an overall multidisciplinary approach. The goals of this MIRA project are to
obtain a comprehensive molecular understanding of the chromatin-based DDR pathway by 1) determining the
epigenetic profile in the DDR pathway, 2) characterizing the functions of the novel DNA repair proteins and 3)
elucidating the mechanism of how damaged chromatin orchestrates different DNA repair pathways during the
cell cycle in the context of damaged chromatin. Using fractionation purification-coupled proteomic approach and
cell-based functional assays, we have identified more than twenty novel DNA repair proteins. Our long-term
goals are to build a physical and genetic network within the chromatin-based DDR pathway and understand its
impact in human health. Overall, these studies will open up a new arena for the DNA repair field, provide insight
into the etiology of cancer and genome instability-related genetic diseases that will lay the foundation for
translational research and therapeutic strategy development."
10911174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are active in only 10-25% of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC) patients. Co-clinical immune profiling studies of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in mCRPC
patients and murine PC models demonstrated sparse immune infiltrates, with predominance of
immunosuppressive myeloid cells, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). PTEN loss-of-function
(LOF) occurs in multiple cancers, and specifically in 50-75% of mCRPC. It is associated with poor prognosis,
therapeutic outcomes and de novo/acquired resistance to ICI in preclinical and clinical studies in multiple tumor
types. In addition to the predominance of TAM within the sparse immune infiltrate in PC, we observed a 2-fold
increase of myeloid derived suppressor cells within the PTEN LOF TME, relative to isogenic PTEN-proficient
counterparts. These data reinforced our project goal of elucidating mechanisms underlying altered
cancer/myeloid cell cross-talk in PTEN LOF mCRPC, that are likely similar across PTEN-deleted malignancies
and contribute to ICI resistance.
 We have demonstrated that cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (c-GAS)/Stimulator of INterferon Genes (STING)
pathway, typically activated in response to cytosolic DNA double strand breaks (DSB), is frequently silenced in
cancer cells, and cGAS/STING activation within myeloid compartment of the TME is critical for generating a
robust immune infiltrate. However, generation of DNA DSB is insufficient to enhance T cell infiltration, which is
consistent with lack of response to PARP inhibition (PARPi) plus ICI observed in our murine models and clinical
studies. Probing more deeply into this disconnect, we found that failed STING pathway activation within TAM
was responsible for this resistance. Furthermore, PI3K activity was preventing STING pathway activation in TAM,
and PI3K inhibition (PI3Ki) plus DNA damage with PARPi led to ICI responsiveness in PTEN-proficient, but not
in isogenic PTEN-knockout PC, suggesting that additional immunosuppressive mechanisms are driven by PTEN
LOF. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PTEN LOF PC are de novo resistant to DNA DSB sensing
c-GAS/STING pathway activation, which can be overcome by direct STING agonist-based combinations, leading
to ICI sensitization. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims. First, we will dissect the TME
in a completed investigator-initiated clinical trial of PARPi/ICI in mCRPC patients, to determine whether the
immune inhibitory mechanisms identified in preclinical models are relevant to patients. Second, we will elucidate
the cancer cell extrinsic mechanism(s) by which PTEN-deficient PC are de novo resistant to DNA-sensing STING
pathway activation. Third, we will interrogate the anti-cancer mechanism and therapeutic potential of direct
STING agonist/PI3Ki combination therapy in sensitizing PTEN-knockout murine CRPC to ICI. Collectively, these
“co-clinical” studies will provide the mechanistic foundation for the next wave of immunotherapeutic strategies to
eradicate PTEN LOF mCRPC."
10911943,"Project 3: Project Summary / Abstract
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with evidence of smooth muscle
differentiation and is one of the most common STS in adults. Nearly half of patients will develop metastatic
disease either prior to diagnosis or during their clinical care. Chemotherapy is the primary modality for treatment
of metastatic LMS, and the standard chemotherapy regimens use doxorubicin or gemcitabine. These
chemotherapy agents carry a significant risk of toxicity, yet only 15-20% of patients will experience an objective
response and only 5-10% will achieve long-term disease control. The median progression-free survival for
patients with metastatic LMS treated with either doxorubicin or a gemcitabine-based regimen is 6 months.
Despite intensive research efforts to understand the biology of LMS, most studies have been underpowered to
correlate recurrent genomic features at diagnosis with clinical outcomes. Patterns of tumor evolution that give
rise to relapse and chemotherapy resistance have remained unstudied due to the safety concerns associated
with anesthesia and surgery to obtain serial tumor biopsies for research. Newly available liquid biopsy
technologies enable the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with cancer. In some
malignancies, ctDNA levels correlate with prognosis, and changes in ctDNA levels correspond to disease
response and progression. In Project 3, a prospective collection of blood samples from patients with metastatic
LMS receiving doxorubicin or gemcitabine/docetaxel chemotherapy will be used to study the correlation between
ctDNA levels and clinical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic LMS as Aim 1. Data from the
biomarker study will also validate ctDNA as a novel prognostic biomarker. Copy number alterations of genes in
LMS from patients enrolled in the biomarker study in Aim 1 will also be examined as potential prognostic factors
and biomarkers of resistance to front-line chemotherapy. Recent studies show that deep sequencing of ctDNA
can be used as a proxy for sequencing of tumor biopsy samples. Evidence suggests that genomic profiles from
ctDNA better represent genomic heterogeneity in patients with metastatic disease than any single biopsy sample.
In Aim 2, we propose to profile serial ctDNA samples to identify recurrent patterns of tumor heterogeneity and
disease evolution in LMS, and to validate identified acquired genetic changes associated with chemotherapy
resistance using patient-derived xenograft models. These studies will have a major impact on development of a
biomarker for LMS and LMS treatment and will fundamentally broaden the understanding of LMS and the natural
history of this disease. Validation of mechanisms of evolution that give rise to resistant disease could lead to
development of novel therapeutic approaches designed to prevent the emergence of resistance and improve
outcomes for patients with metastatic LMS in the near future."

Project 3: From Networks and Structures to Hierarchical Whole-Cell Models of Cancer
Project Leads: Trey Ideker and Andrej Sali; Co-Investigators: Emma Lundberg, Jennifer Grandis, J. Silvio
Gutkind, and Laura van ’t Veer
SUMMARY
One of the striking discoveries of the cancer genome projects is that each tumor presents a unique set of genetic
mutations and molecular alterations. To understand how these alterations give rise to cancer and treatment
outcomes, the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) has launched systematic efforts to map the physical and
functional architecture of tumor cells, capturing the molecular components and pathways on which cancer
mutations converge. While parts of this effort are experimental, this Project 3 presents the central computational
framework.
A first computational theme concerns methods to assemble the structure of the multiscale tumor cell map. Aim
1 focuses on creating 3D models of cancer-associated protein complexes. It will apply established methods of
integrative structural biology to data from other projects, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), affinity
purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and genetic interaction
datasets. Initial efforts will focus on PIK3CA-HER3 and mTOR complexes, identified in previous work by the
CCMI, then move to new protein complexes identified by our ongoing mapping activities. Aim 2 focuses on
mapping tumor cellular components at scales at and above the protein complex, extending to larger cellular
components, compartments, and organelles. It will expand on a compelling proof-of-concept for creating an
unbiased hierarchical map of human cell components by integration of AP-MS data with protein distribution data
from immunofluorescence confocal images. These whole-cell maps will be analyzed to reveal specific cellular
components under mutational selection in breast, head-and-neck, and lung cancers.
A second computational theme concerns methods to integrate tumor cell maps with functional analysis and
predictive medicine. Aim 3 uses the maps to build interpretable deep learning systems for prediction of drug
responses. This aim draws from our previous work to establish “visible” learning models (DCell and DrugCell),
which are not black boxes but have internal organization determined by prior knowledge of biological structure.
We will construct such models from CCMI tumor cell maps, incorporating key improvements over our first-
generation pilots. Finally, Aim 4 will use visible deep learning systems alongside other machine learning models
to design and evaluate combinatorial biomarkers for breast, head-and-neck, and lung tumors in the patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) and clinical settings. Clinical samples and data will be drawn from molecular
tumor boards and the I-SPY breast cancer trial. PDX and clinical data will be used for further optimization
of our predictive models using nascent techniques from transfer learning.
Through these aims, we will advance our basic knowledge of the structure and function of tumors while
embedding this knowledge within intelligent systems for precision medicine."

SUMMARY
Systematic characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and genetic interaction networks of cancer
drivers is critical for the identification of functional complexes for patient stratification and targeted cancer
therapies. Proteomic approaches that determine PPIs and protein complex stoichiometry and topology can
provide strategic insight into the dynamic cancer landscape and help guide tailored genetic screens to assess
functional relevance of newly characterized PPIs. The Functional Genomics and Proteomics Core (Core 1)
will provide the infrastructure and technical expertise essential to the completion of the overall CCMI objectives.
With support of two Core facilities, the Functional Genomics and Proteomics Core will provide its expertise
in CRISPR genetic screens (Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM) Genomics Center, UCSD) and proteomic
technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific Proteomics Facility for Disease Target Discovery, UCSF, Quantitative
Biosciences Institute (QBI), Gladstone Institute) for the generation of high-quality protein-protein (Aim 2; in
support of Project 1) and genetic (Aim 1; in support of Project 2) interaction data, which will be integrated using
systems biology approaches in Project 3 and Core 2. Our goal is to provide functional and structural
characterization of cancer driver networks, model their functional interactions in three different cancers (breast,
head and neck, lung cancer), and determine consequences of introducing point mutations. Finally, we will use a
unique platform for Endogenous Network/Dynamic Structure (EN/DS) determination (Aim 3) that will use
CRISPR-based genetics to introduce point mutations and FLAG-affinity tags into the endogenous loci of selected
genes to study endogenous protein complex stoichiometry and structure using mass spectrometry and cryo-EM

bioinformatics analytical knowledge as well as computational expertise. The DAC will provide biostatistical and
bioinformatic collaboration in support of the discovery, translational, and clinical studies associated with the
SPORE research activities. The comprehensive nature of this core assures each SPORE investigator access to
expertise that includes collaborative development of study designs, collection and management of data,
generation of analysis plans, support for clinical trials, analysis of data, interpretation of data, development of
computational platforms for data mining, and dissemination of results (e.g., abstracts, presentations,
manuscripts). Furthermore, the DAC will facilitate knowledge-sharing among the projects and cores by identifying
and communicating best practices, standardizing data when possible, centralizing data for use across the
projects, and conveying results to SPORE investigators in a timely fashion. Finally, the core is poised to develop
new methodology when needed to support the SPORE research as well as to adapt to changes in research
strategy in response to new or unexpected findings. In summary, to support all proposed SPORE projects, the
Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, the other cores, and related SPORE research,
the DAC will (1) provide biostatistics and bioinformatics collaboration for all SPORE research activities, (2)
facilitate data collection, management, integration, and storage for SPORE research activities, and (3) develop
and implement methodology that enhances the research across the SPORE projects.
The members of DAC will work closely with team members of each of the projects. In addition, they will
collaborate closely with bioinformatics personnel within the research teams of the project PIs to ensure alignment
of the statistical aspects with the bioinformatics efforts and allow the integration of bioinformatics data across

10911952,"Developmental Research Program (DRP): Project Summary / Abstract
The Developmental Research Program (DRP) will support the efforts of the Genetics and Genomics of
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS): Improved understanding of cancer biology and new approaches to diagnosis and
treatment SPORE. This DRP will complement or enhance the variety and depth of sarcoma translational
research, seeking to ensure continual renewal of high-quality translational scientific investigation. The DRP
supports short-range studies to establish the data needed to facilitate hypothesis-driven translational projects.
Although the DRP will fund established investigators, an important goal is to identify and stimulate interest in
sarcoma research among groups whose current focus may be different but sufficiently and transitionally related.
In addition, we seek to attract early and mid- career investigators and especially Black and Latino or Hispanic
investigators. Co-directing this program will be Steven Robinson, Associate Professor of Medicine at Mayo
School of Medicine. Dr. Robinson is a Jamaican born man educated in Jamaica. For the past 4 years he has
been supported by career development grants to Mayo Clinic including the institutional K12 as well as the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation Amos Medical Faculty Development Program. Dr. Robinson is recent recipient of
Department of Defense IDEA Award. He also leads a ETCTN clinical trial that evaluates the combination of
TVEC with radiation therapy for localized sarcoma. Dr. Robinson will also participate in this SPORE by co-leading
our efforts to improve diversity in patients enrolled in clinical trials as well as increasing minority faculty
participation. Dr. Baker is the Co-Director of this DRP. He is the SPORE Principal Investigator. Dr. Baker has
made important contributions to the treatment of sarcomas beginning with the initial identification of doxorubicin
as an effective drug in sarcoma patients; the establishment of neo-adjuvant therapy strategy making
osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma curable diseases. Dr. Baker has an outstanding record of leadership and
collaboration within the sarcoma translational research field. Dr. Baker is most proud of his mentorship efforts.
Now 15 Professors of Medicine claim Dr Baker as their mentor.
Robinson and Baker are joined by a highly qualified committee of experienced clinician-scientists (DRP
Committee) which reviews and evaluates new pilot projects as the basis of providing recommendations to the
SPORE Executive Committee (Chair, Judy Garber) and the SPORE MPI, who bear the responsibility to select
DRP projects appropriate for funding. The DRP Committee includes members from major cancer centers who
possess expertise in key aspects of sarcoma science and therapeutics, including biology and genetics,
correlative science, sarcoma pathology, molecular diagnostics, sarcoma drug resistance, immuno-oncology and
statistical design and analysis. The DRP will provide the depth required to maintain innovation in this SPORE."
10911953,"Career Enhancement Program (CEP): Project Summary / Abstract
By its very nature, leiomyosarcoma (LMS) demands a multi-disciplinary approach to care and research. LMS are
highly aggressive tumors, which frequently present at high stage, and require the coordinated and integrated
care of surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. In addition, the diverse nature of the anatomic
sites of presentation, the differential behavior, and molecular characteristics of soft tissue and uterine LMS, and
genotypic and phenotypic overlap with other pleomorphic sarcomas demands the involvement of anatomic and
molecular pathologists. This SPORE will be uniquely poised to provide career development opportunities and
mentorship for young investigators in all of these disciplines. In particular, the SPORE CEP will recruit and
promote promising young researchers to pursue careers in translational studies of LMS or genetic predisposition
for sarcoma/LMS. The SPORE mechanism will provide these CEP awardees with rich opportunities to interact
with and learn from basic, translational, and clinical sarcoma researchers from key disciplines.
 Elizabeth G. Demicco MD, PhD (University of Toronto), and Jonathan A. Fletcher MD (Dana Farber
Cancer Institute) will serve as co-directors for the SPORE CEP committee. The CEP committee will assist the
co-directors in ensuring that the CEP meets its goals and that awardees are progressing in their career
development and being adequately mentored. The committee represents the multi-disciplinary nature
of translational sarcoma research, with particular expertise in sarcoma biology, target discovery and
validations, genomics, experimental therapeutics, biostatistics, surgery, radiation medicine,
biomarkers, and pathology. The committee members are academic leaders at the SPORE member
institutions with experience in LMS. As seen across sarcoma-relevant medical and surgical disciplines,
women and minorities continue to be underrepresented. It is a priority for this SPORE that diversity is
enhanced in sarcoma research and we have endeavored to contribute to this effort by including women
as members of all SPORE Committees and in the program leadership.
 Providing research support and protected time for young investigators is essential in translational
research, particularly in sarcoma research, where funding mechanisms are few. The SPORE CEP will facilitate
transition of awardees to independent investigator status and will prioritize funding early career scientists who
seek to advance quality of life through research on disease mechanisms. Specific aims that assist the SPORE
CEP in achieving these goals include: 1. Identifying and providing exceptional science and career mentorship to
young sarcoma researchers; 2. Enforcing adequate protected time for clinically-oriented investigators to facilitate
their development into independent translational researchers; 3. Recruiting highly qualified minority and women
investigators from diverse clinical and scientific backgrounds into translational LMS research; and 4. Promoting
multi-disciplinary research by encouraging young investigators to participate in scientific retreats."
10911980,"ABSTRACT – Project 1, Fertility and Cancer Care Delivery in AYAs
 Future fertility is a critical concern for many adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. National
guidelines universally recommend fertility counseling for AYA cancer patients before potentially gonadotoxic
treatment begins. However, prior studies have shown that patients often do not receive fertility counseling.
With the long-term goal of examining how fertility counseling may enhance cancer treatment adherence and
outcomes, this study will investigate: 1) potential disparities in receipt of fertility counseling and access to
fertility preservation strategies; and, 2) how fertility concerns impact the receipt of recommended cancer
treatments for AYAs with breast cancer, testicular cancer, or lymphoma.
 Limited access to specialists and unconscious biases in provider referrals may result in demographic,
socioeconomic, and disease-related disparities in receipt of fertility counseling and preservation services.
When routinely provided, referrals to fertility specialists can be rapid and preservation strategies can be
completed within a few weeks. AYAs whose fertility-related concerns are not addressed though counseling
and/or fertility preservation strategies may spend more time seeking fertility information or making medical
appointments on their own. They may avoid or postpone potentially gonadotoxic therapies, increasing their
risk of treatment delays or non-initiation or non-persistence of cancer therapies compared to patients whose
fertility-related concerns are addressed. Our study will investigate how gaps in delivery of fertility counseling
may have an impact beyond meeting patients’ reproductive goals, by contributing to suboptimal cancer
treatments for AYAs. While several small studies have partially assessed these issues in young women with
breast cancer, they remain unstudied in AYAs with most other cancers.
 In this P01, we plan to survey approximately 5,000 AYA cancer survivors. For this Project, we will collect
information on fertility concerns, receipt of fertility counseling, use of fertility preservation techniques, and
factors that may influence use of fertility services. Survey participants will be AYA cancer patients 2–10 years

10917370,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A key goal of “Healthy People 2030” is to improve the health of adults through aerobic physical activity. Soccer,
the most popular sport on earth, is an aerobic outlet for more than 25 million Americans. The potential benefits
of soccer are offset by repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI) from soccer heading. RSHI are associated
with exposure-dependent adverse effects on neuroimaging and on cognitive performance, independent of
collisions and concussion. The tradeoffs between aerobic benefits and RSHI-related harms are not known. The
central aim of this proposal is to examine the aerobic benefits of soccer play, in relation to RSHI harms,
for brain structure and function, and to explore person-level factors that modify this risk-benefit tradeoff.
Beneficial effects of aerobic capacity and adverse subclinical effects of RSHI can be detected with neuroimaging
of white matter. However, little is known about their joint impact on white matter and, in turn, how white matter
features mediate effects on cognitive function. Fundamental knowledge on the RSHI risk-benefit balance can
inform our understanding of RSHI morbidity and its mitigation beyond the specific context of soccer, such as
other sports and combat. Prior work on RSHI effects has not specifically measured aerobic capacity, and little is
known about whether and how white matter mediates exposure-outcome associations. Our proposed 2-year
longitudinal follow up study of 280 young adults, including soccer players with high (n=70) and low (n=70)
exposure to RSHI, non-collision athletes (n=70) and non-athlete controls (n=70), will test the hypothesis that
aerobic capacity-engendered benefits confound and modify the adverse effects of RSHI on white matter
that, in turn, is a mediator of adverse cognitive effects. We will measure aerobic capacity (VO2max) and
RSHI over 2 years and perform Myelin Water and Microstructure MRI of white matter as well as cognitive
assessments, at enrollment and 2 years later. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the
joint effects of VO2max and RSHI on white matter myelination and microstructure. Aim 2: Assess mediation by
white matter of the known associations of VO2max and RSHI with cognitive performance. Aim 3: Explore the
BDNF-Val66met and ApoE-ε4 gene variants as modifiers of the tradeoff of VO2max and RHSI-mediated effects
on white matter. Delineating risk vs. benefit to cognitive performance from soccer can transform perception of
risk by stakeholders, facilitate choice and guidance on soccer participation and heading. Choices that impact
young adult players, with high RSHI exposure and decades of future needs, have the potential to impact their
wellbeing, healthcare footprint and productivity for decades."
10912493,"Background: Veterans are more likely to report psychological distress, which also elevates their risk for
certain social determinants of health, such as unmet social needs (e.g., housing instability). As the entry point
for most Veterans into care, the presence of multidisciplinary members on integrated Patient Aligned Care
Teams (PACTs) in primary care, such as social workers and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI)
providers helps to address the wholistic needs of these Veterans by providing increased access to additional
resources that have found to improve patient outcomes. Significance: However, prior research has showed
that these integrated PACTs continue to demonstrate significant variation in meeting the needs of Veterans
with psychological distress and unmet social needs (even with the skillsets brought to the PACT by the new
members) leaving opportunities to improve access. Due to the negative impact of the comorbid experience of
psychological distress and unmet social needs on Veteran’s health on health, identifying ways to optimize
access to care within these integrated PACTs is an opportunity to reach a broad array of Veterans. Innovation
and Impact: The proposed research is innovative through its attention to an underdeveloped area of the
healthcare structure, integrated PACT characteristics, and its relationship with access. Informed by prior PACT
implementation literature and a conceptual framework on patient navigation, integrated PACT characteristics
include: structural, provider-specific, and team behaviors. Our aims seek to use mixed methods to provide
a comprehensive understanding from multiple perspectives on PACT characteristics predictive of improved
access and identify associated processes to achieve access within integrated PACTs within this high need
population. These results will provide immediate guidance to VHA on the types of evidence-based
interventions that can be utilized and practice changes that may support those interventions in achieving
access to care for Veterans with unmet social needs and psychological distress. Specific Aims: Aim 1 will
identify integrated PACT characteristics (provider, structural, and team behaviors) that significantly
predict initial engagement to care among Veterans with unmet social needs and psychological
distress. Hypothesis: Integrated PACT structural, such as staffing, and team behaviors, such as team meetings
will be the strongest predictors of initial Veteran engagement in care. Aim 2 will identify best practices and
perspectives from members and administrators within high performing integrated PACTs on ways to achieve
optimization of significant integrated PACT characteristics supporting high levels of engagement among these
Veterans. Aim 3 will test a model of hypothesized relationships between integrated PACT characteris tics and
access as measured by Veterans’ perceptions of care (perceived access), ratings of quality of care, and
engagement in care. Methodology: Aim 1 will combine data from two data sources (administrative data mixed
with integrated PACT (n=160) surveys) to identify which integrated PACT characteristics significantly predict
initial engagement, which will be defined as receipt of mental health or social resource care. Eligible Veterans
have recently been seen in primary care, report current psychological distress and the presence of at least one
unmet social need will be eligible. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews to provide more in-depth information to
identify best practices and perspectives from high-performing integrated PACT members and administrators
(n=30). Aim 3 will use Aim 1 data and Veteran surveys (n=2000) to examine the role that Veterans’ perceptions
of care and quality of care play within the relationship between integrated PACT characteristics and
engagement in care using structural equation modeling. Steps/Implementation: Results will be shared via
traditional publications, but also directly with key stakeholders in primary care, who will utilize these results to
guide quality improvement projects. For instance, the results could help inform the PCMHI Competency
training efforts on various PACT characteristics when training new PCMHI providers."
10913556,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
This proposed P01 program has the goal of creating a locus of research examining the pathways by which
technology and digital media (TDM) exposure and usage impact developmental trajectories and health outcomes
in adolescence. The Administrative Core (Admin Core) of this proposal will provide the necessary support to the
program investigators, staff and collaborators over the longitudinal design of the proposed Projects. This Core
will serve as the common channel through which all scientific, administrative and fiscal communication occur to
facilitate the exchange of information between Project investigators and staff internally, as well as disseminating
the findings of the Projects and communicating research advances to the public. The Admin Core will thus
provide coordination and an organizational backbone for the 3 Projects and 2 Cores involved in this P01
proposal. The Admin Core of this P01 program proposal will focus on five Specific Aims. First, this Core will
provide grant coordination, organization and management services. Second, the Admin Core will organize and
coordinate biostatistical support for Projects 1 and 3. Investigators will also identify novel analysis ideas based
on early findings towards triangulating data across all 3 Projects given the shared participant pool. Third, the
Admin Core will ensure ongoing involvement of this P01 proposal’s team of co-investigators, consultants, and
the internal and external advisory committees. Given that the three PIs are all located at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, this Program proposal includes an Internal Advisory Committee spanning diverse
disciplines across areas of technology and digital media, as well as adolescent health and development. This
P01 proposal includes strong institutional support including matching funds from the involved departments and
schools, and main campus at UW Madison. Fourth, as a university-based research team, all Program
investigators are committed to the ongoing growth of the next generation of researchers. Thus, a specific aim of
this Core will focus on engaging diverse undergraduate and graduate students in all 3 Projects. Finally, the fifth
aim will focus on ensuring timely and targeted dissemination across local, national and scientific and community
audiences. This Admin Core team includes Core Lead and P01 PI Dr. Megan Moreno, the biostatistical team
includes Dr. Jens Eickhoff whom Dr. Moreno has worked with across several previous projects, the Admin Core
administrative and research staff who all have experience and existing collaborations with Dr. Moreno, and
Communication Lead staff member Ms. Bushman who will ensure that our learnings and findings reach
communities to optimize the impact of this collaborative interdisciplinary research program."
10913559,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RECRUITMENT & RETENTION CORE
This proposed P01 program has the goal of creating a locus of research examining the pathways by which
technology and digital media (TDM) exposure and usage impact developmental trajectories and health outcomes
in adolescence. The Recruitment and Retention Core (R&R Core) of this proposal will provide the necessary
support to our shared pool of participants who will contribute across all 3 Projects. The R&R Core will serve as
the common channel through which all support and resources for participants occurs to ensure a successful
recruitment and consistent levels of participant engagement over this longitudinal study. The R&R Core will thus
provide coordination and an organizational backbone for the participant experience in this P01 program. The
R&R Core of this P01 program will focus on four Specific Aims. First, the R&R Core will leverage our Recruitment
Ambassadors and consultant towards recruiting a diverse group of adolescent participants as our shared
participant pool. Rolling recruitment will occur over years 1 and 2 of this P01 program to achieve a shared
participant pool of 400 adolescents. Adolescents ages 13-15 years at enrollment will be recruited across different
settings for a 2-year research study experience. We have worked with our Recruitment Ambassadors to create
an initial list of recruitment opportunities that would be refined and implemented at program inception. Second,
the investigators and staff will complete initial and ongoing regulatory processes including human subjects
protocols. Third, the R&R Core will organize and communicate timelines relevant to each participant’s entry time
point over our two-year rolling recruitment. Each participant will be scheduled for every 6-month data collection
experiences and assigned to a group (Group A: n=150 participants with fMRI, Group B: n=250 participants
without fMRI). And finally, the fourth aim of the R&R Core will be to retain participants for the 2-year study. We
have incorporated the perspectives of Dr. Moreno’s research team’s Youth Advisory Board (YAB) into our
proposed retention plans, which include incentives that incorporate internal and external motivations for serving
as a research participant. We are excited about our dynamic R&R Core team, including Core Lead Dr. Selkie
who brings experience recruiting and retaining early adolescents, and P01 PI Dr. Megan Moreno who brings
experience retaining college students in a 5-year study. Research staff on this Core include Victoria Adkins, who
has worked with Dr. Selkie the past 4 years on a longitudinal study of early adolescents. Our Recruitment
Ambassadors will be valued partners in our efforts on this R&R Core. This P01 program provides the opportunity
for alignment in our research efforts through a shared participant pool that all 3 Projects will draw from, and
synergy by triangulation of participant data across Projects. Thus, this Core will enhance the scientific knowledge,
ideas and outcomes obtained through the interactions of the R&R Core, the Admin Core and the 3 Projects."
10934924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of blindness worldwide is avoidable. However, in
resource-limited settings progressive eye diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) often go undiagnosed until it is too late. New approaches that detect progressive
eye diseases before they cause irreversible vision loss could help reduce visual impairment of communities. One
such approach is community-based eye disease screening. The Village Integrated Eye Workers Trial II (VIEW
II) is an ongoing cluster-randomized trial in which communities in Nepal receive visual acuity screening and are
subsequently randomized to receive either a community-based eye disease screening intervention consisting of
optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) assessment, or to no intervention. The goal
of the screening intervention is to detect cases of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular
degeneration—all of which are progressive and cause irreversible vision loss if left untreated—and refer these
cases to the local eye hospital for management. A door-to-door census is performed four years after starting the
screening intervention to determine the effectiveness of screening for reducing vision impairment relative to
communities not receiving the screening intervention.
 This is a proposal for the extension of the VIEW II trial, maintaining the original randomization and
continuing the same screening intervention in the study clusters except that fundus photography is also included
in the screening intervention and that the targeted age group is expanded to those ≥50 years. The specific aims
of the proposal are (1) to determine if the screening intervention is effective for preventing vision loss at the
community level over 7 years, (2) to compare text messages versus community volunteers for improving linkage
to care, and (3) to determine the natural history of OCT measurements over time in a population-based study.
Glaucoma, DR, and AMD are slowly progressive diseases, and given interruptions to study activities caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, the originally planned 4-year endpoint in the original VIEW II trial may not be long
enough to observe the full effect of the screening intervention. Extending the trial will provide a more accurate
assessment of any benefit of screening. Extending the trial also allows for repeated OCTs in a population-based
sample, providing much needed data on the natural history of OCT parameters to help clinicians better determine
what constitutes progression. This research is significant because it will provide the strongest type of evidence
to guide national eye health programs – results from a randomized controlled trial. Ultimately, this trial will benefit
blindness prevention programs worldwide in deciding how to allocate limited resources to optimally detect eye
disease."
10937998,"Microglia are long-lived, self-replicating, yolk sac-derived immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS)
parenchyma that are critical modulators of immunity and neuropathology. Microglia dysfunction contributes to
several neurologic diseases relevant to the VA, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). In our preliminary studies, we have unexpectedly identified microglia circulating with the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS and ALS. We hypothesize that CSF microglia are endogenous
CNS cells that exhibit signatures unique to neurologic disease states. We aim to identify any disease-
associated characteristics of CSF microglia. We will explore the number and immunologic features of CSF
microglia in MS and ALS by flow cytometric analysis. To explore the molecular signature of CSF microglia in
various disease states, we will perform single cell RNA sequencing on sorted cells. Comparisons will be made
between gene expression patterns in CSF microglia between MS and ALS and in relation to healthy control
subjects to determine the health- and disease-specific profile of these cells. Finally, we will pursue flow
cytometric and RNA sequencing studies in rats, with a particular focus on models of MS and ALS, to uncover
the origins and function of CSF microglia. This proposal will lay the groundwork for the characterization of a
novel cellular population capable of regulating CNS immunity."
10912832,"Project Summary:
We have identified a collective series of factors that affect variability in the production, uptake and conversion of
androgens capable of activating the androgen receptor and driving tumor progression in prostate cancer.
Paradoxically, however, these same factors may predict response to specific therapies that target these
mechanisms. We hypothesize that genetic variation in HSD3B1, SLCO2B1, and SRD5A2, each critical drivers
of androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC) in prostate cancer, confer cumulative effects on
outcome in populations determining both high and low likelihoods of response to AR directed agents, and can
form effective biomarker-based therapy selection approaches in the context of treatment resistance.
Following successful development of both enzalutamide and abiraterone (led by the PI of this proposal) in
chemotherapy naïve CRPC, members of our team designed and completed A031201 a randomized phase III
NCI Cooperative Group trial of Enzalutamide (E) vs Enzalutamide+Abiraterone Acetate (E/AA). This trial is
now complete and the data were recently presented. Clinical and genetic data from nearly all patients affords
the opportunity to evaluate outcomes based on HSD3B1, SLCO2B1 and SRD5A genotype, their relationship
to disease biology (factors such as wild type versus altered TP53) and clinical outcomes to guide future
biomarker-driven treatment science.
In this proposal we perform analyses of patient genetic factors and match it to clinical outcome and androgen
metabolites based on the APUC model. In the first aim we define the prevalence and magnitude of effect of
variants in genetic related to androgen production, uptake and conversion (APUC). Next, we seek to construct
a multivariable model to identify “APUC sensitive” and “APUC resistant” profiles integrating disease biological
factors known to confer primary and acquired treatment resistance to abiraterone and potentially
enzalutamide. Finally, we will test the pharmacodynamic reduction of an abiraterone metabolite, 3-keto
5abiraterone, with agonist capabilities, with the drug Dutasteride in patients who harbor the 1245c variation in
the HSD3B1 gene. This variant of HSD3B1 leads to a gain of function and we hypothesize that the
accumulation of this agonist drives resistance to abiraterone. Dutasteride inhibits 5 reductase, and therefore
the production of the 5 abiraterone metabolite that functions as an AR agonist. Based on the rPFS data we
may propose a phase III clinical trial through the cooperative group mechanisms. We will screen
approximately 300 individuals on abiraterone to randomize 100 patients to dutasteride or observation. The
study has adequate power to demonstrate a meaningful radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) benefit.
We will integrate our APUC model into an understanding of the outcomes of this phase II study."
10911033,"Abstract
 Commensal microbiota critically regulates osteoimmune processes mediating post-pubertal skeletal
development. Our studies have shown that the commensal gut microbiota suppresses osteoblastic bone-
forming cells and enhances osteoclastic bone-resorbing cells, which impairs bone mass accrual. However,
mechanisms discerning commensal microbiota effects on bone across the lifespan are unclear.
 The study of osteoimmunology has shown that immune cells in the bone marrow regulate bone
modeling/remodeling. Despite knowledge that the commensal gut microbiota directs crosstalk with host
immunity, immune mechanistic studies elucidating the commensal gut microbiota immunomodulatory effects on
skeletal maturation are unclear. Preliminary findings from the investigator’s postdoctoral research work suggest
that commensal microbiota-host interactions stimulate complement signaling to have system catabolic effects in
the maturing skeleton in health and disease.
 Complement signaling protects the host from infection and modulates the immune response, highlighting
the role of complement in maintaining a homeostatic relationship with the commensal microbiota. Our
preliminary data demonstrated that the commensal microbiota upregulates circulating complement
anaphylatoxin C3a, which has also been implicated in inflammatory bowel pathogenesis. Complement receptor
C3aR is expressed on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, implying that C3a may be a critical regulator of
commensal microbiota effects on the maturing skeleton in health and disease. Three specific aims will address
critical in vivo and in vitro studies utilizing transgenic mice deleting C3aR in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts in
health and under dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. These three aims will investigate the overall
hypothesis that the commensal gut microbiota upregulation of C3a regulates C3aR derived skeletal maturation
in health and disease throughout the lifespan. Aim 1 will elucidate the role of commensal gut microbiota on
C3aR-mediated osteoblastogenesis in skeletal maturation and deterioration under normal and inflammatory
bowel conditions. Aim 2 will examine commensal gut microbiota actions on C3aR-osteoclastogenic signaling in
the maturing and aging skeleton in health and disease. Aim 3 will determine whether probiotic administration
regulates C3a/C3aR signaling during post-pubertal skeletal development. Elucidating the relationship between
C3/C3aR signaling, the gut microbiota, and bone will provide opportunities for therapeutic interventions to
optimize bone mass accrual in young service members and protect against skeletal deterioration in aging
Veterans.
 This research seeks to define osteoimmunological processes regulating peak bone mass accrual to
withstand either age-related and/or disease-related skeletal deterioration. These studies will innovatively use
bone cells specific C3aR knockdown models to determine microbiota derived complement signaling effects on
skeletal maturation. Notably, this work proposes probiotic interventions during a peak bone mass accrual window
to define the role of the commensal microbiota on complement C3a/C3aR on the skeleton throughout the
lifespan. Additionally, this proposal will provide solid career development in new areas of expertise and career
tools necessary for the applicant's transition to an independent VA investigator. This will be accomplished
through proposed coursework, hands-on training, networking, and mentoring experiences provided by the CDA-
2 mechanism."
10935613,"Project Summary (Core C: Genotyping, Analysis and eQTL Core)
 The purpose of this core is to provide genotyping and analysis services for the supported grants.
Analysis services will focus on genome wide association studies (GWAS) that are intended to identify the
relationships between genotypes and phenotypes with the ultimate goal of implicating specific genes that
influence substance use disorder (SUD) relevant traits. The wet-lab protocols and bioinformatic pipelines used
by this core have already been established, but they will continue to be improved over the course of the
funding period. We will also continue to provide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, presenting
these results on a public facing website and also incorporating them into the GWAS results. This core will also
perform the wet-lab and bioinformatic steps necessary for phenotype prediction in support of RATTACA (RAT
Trait Ascertainment using Common Alleles), which is described in Core B.
 One of the key services that this core will offer is the ability to genotype heterogeneous stock (HS) rats
at millions of polymorphic markers with an accuracy of >99.75% at an extremely low cost. We will accomplish
this by performing low coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) followed by an imputation step that uses
the deep sequence data that are available from the 8 inbred founders of the HS population. This approach has
undergone multiple improvements over the past decade. We have used this approach to genotype HS rats,
Sprague Dawley rats, various outbred mouse populations and most recently zebrafish; however, the purpose
of this core is to genotype HS rats for supported grants. We will continue to improve this pipeline by inputting
tandem repeats and structural variants and by calling genotypes on the Y and mitochondrial chromosomes.
 In addition to genotyping HS rats, this core will perform genetic analyses, which include GWAS,
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), heritability estimates, genetic correlations and related
approaches. We have already demonstrated our ability to perform these analyses and will offer them as a
service to supported grants. Results are summarized in “reports'' that provide figures and tables that can be
incorporated directly into publications. These reports are one of the primary outputs of this core and would be
extremely difficult for the supported grants to develop independently because they require substantial
statistical and computational expertise.
 Finally, this core will support two public facing websites. The first provides the only available eQTL
resource for rats. The second will introduce, for the first time, a public facing transcriptome wide association
studies (TWAS) portal, allowing investigators to query individual genes and discover correlations between the
genetically determined expression of that gene and all of the phenotypes in our HS rat database; the database,
which is supported by Core A, currently contains phenotype and genotype data for more than 15,000 HS rats
and will continue to grow over the course of this award."

Working with a diverse set of collaborators around the world, TRD1 investigators have made substantial
progress and significant contributions over the previous two funding periods since 2014. Building upon the
foundation established in the previous funding periods, we are now poised to expand TRD1 into exciting new
areas that we believe have the potential to help shape the future of rapid MRI. We will reimagine the process of
MR scanning, leveraging our core expertise in pulse-sequence design, parallel imaging, compressed sensing,
model-based image reconstruction and machine learning to enable intelligent quantification in MRI. We will
also diversify our rapid MRI methods to integrate multifaceted sampling schemes, such as spiral or rosette
trajectories, to achieve more efficient and effective sampling for new MRI applications such as low-field
imaging and diffusion imaging. Additionally, we will also explore a new area of rapid MRI exploiting longitudinal
image memory, with a focus on emerging new applications such as MR-guided radiotherapy and longitudinal

The broad mission of our Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) is to bring together
collaborative translational research teams for the development of high-impact biomedical imaging
technologies, with the ultimate goal of changing day-to-day clinical practice. Technology Research and
Development (TRD) Project 3 addresses the fundamental question of what MRI signal means at the cellular
level. Unwilling to settle for the nominal resolution of clinical MRI, constrained to millimeter-sized voxels by
fundamental physical and physiological limits, we have been exploring ways to quantify tissue microstructure at
the scale of ∼ 1 − 10𝜇𝜇m, commensurate with water diffusion length. Incorporating diffusion MRI contrast into
our acquisitions opens an avenue to supplement the subjective interpretation of anatomic images with
objective parametric maps of cellular-scale biophysical parameters. Such maps, e.g., of cell sizes, water
fractions in various cell types, membrane permeability and exchange rate, even if averaged over millimeter-
scale voxels, would break new ground in clinical applications and basic research. In TRD3, we will integrate
tissue microstructure mapping into comprehensive image data acquisitions, to address an unmet clinical need:
achieving specificity to microstructural changes at the cellular level, to understand physiology and pathology, to
detect disease at the earliest opportunity, to monitor disease progression, and to quantify efficacy of treatment.
Building on our track record to date, we plan to develop and share acquisition, modeling, and validation tools,
and translate them to the clinic. Each of the other TRDs, along with a wide range of CPs and SPs, will benefit
from these tools. At the same time, microstructure research will also benefit from inclusion in the connective
context of the NCBIB, with its mix of expertise (in hardware, image acquisition and reconstruction, machine
learning, etc., complementing the TRD3 team’s expertise in biophysical modelling and validation), and with its
track record of day-to-day interaction between researchers and clinicians."
10938748,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is becoming a national health crisis as the
sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Prominent behavioral manifestations of AD include memory
loss and cognition with the pathological hallmark of the extracellular amyloid beta (A) plaques and intraneuronal
deposits of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) accumulation. Among that, A accumulation is proposed to initiate the
AD via damaging synapses and neurons. However, therapeutics targeting on Aβ hypothesis were found to have
little success. Therefore, identifying novel molecular and cellular factors underlying the pathogenesis of AD is
urgent in developing effective therapies. One of the important risk factors for AD is aging which is associated
with bioenergetic deficits, oxidized redox environment, and chronic inflammation that leads to synapse dysfunc-
tion and neuron damage. Our preliminary study showed that a novel age-related protein, activated protein C
(APC) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD via modulating the metabolic and redox homeostasis in the
brain. APC is a plasma protease exerting anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects, including modulating meta-
bolic pathways, repressing inflammation, and protecting neurons from stroke and trauma. Intriguingly, we found
that the depletion of APC in mice results in aging-like cardiac dysfunction and AD-like cognitive deficit symptoms.
Recombinant APC can block the deposition of amyloid plaque, improves cognitive behavior, and ameliorates the
cardiac dysfunction observed in AD model mice. Our long-term objective is to understand the roles and mecha-
nisms of APC in AD pathogenesis to develop an effective therapeutic strategy for the elderly with AD. At the
mechanistic level, APC depletion induces the derangement of metabolic and redox homeostasis in the brain
while APC treatment triggers activated protein kinase B (AKT) signaling which stimulates glucose metabolic rate,
represses cellular inflammatory signaling, and reduces amyloid plaques in AD. Therefore, we hypothesize that
APC plays a critical role in protecting neurofunction through maintaining metabolic homeostasis and repressing
neuroinflammatory responses against AD pathogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested by following two specific
aims: 1) To characterize the role of APC signaling in the pathogenesis of AD. 2) To elucidate the capability of
APC derivatives to improve neurofunction against AD. In addition, we will determine if the anticoagulant domain
of APC is important for its neuroprotective function to provide evidence that recombinant APC without anticoag-
ulant activity can be used for therapy of Alzheimer’s disease without the risk of bleeding."
10938261,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this study is to understand psychosocial sequelae and their biological and social determinants
among patients with advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) receiving immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has
recently been approved by the FDA for advanced HNC. Patients with advanced cancer often experience
substantial clinical prognostic uncertainty, leading to increased psychosocial burden, which, in turn, contributes
to worse survival, including in HNC. However, evidence on immunotherapy-related psychosocial burdens is
not well-documented, particularly for HNC. Patients with HNC suffer a high psychosocial burden before
immunotherapy, likely due to common and long-lasting disease- and treatment-induced side effects (e.g., dry
mouth, difficulty opening mouth, and mucositis) that uniquely and significantly impact HNC patients’ critical
daily functions (e.g., eating and speaking). These psychosocial burdens are speculated to be even higher
among those receiving immunotherapy due to advanced cancer stage and uncertainty from immunotherapy
length and side effects. Given the scarce evidence, there is a pressing need to investigate psychosocial
sequelae (e.g., fatigue, depression) among patients receiving immunotherapy so that specialized care can be
targeted to improve QOL and long-term survival. Additionally, identifying biological and social determinants of
psychosocial sequelae will highlight risk factors and provide instrumental guidance on interventional strategies.
We and others have found that greater inflammation is associated with worse symptomatic side effects,
including psychosocial symptoms, and poorer QOL and survival in cancer patients. Nevertheless, whether
immunotherapy-associated inflammation is part of the biological determinants of psychosocial sequelae is
unknown. Furthermore, an emerging appreciation of the gut-brain connection has suggested the involvement
of the gut microbiome in psychosocial sequelae. Our preliminary data show that inflammation-related taxa are
linked with high psychosocial sequelae, suggesting that restoration of depleted bacteria or their metabolites
has the potential to reverse the dysbiosis-associated phenotypes. Still, larger studies are warranted to validate
the findings before the development of individual, targeted interventions. Social determinants also impact a
wide range of health-related conditions and contribute substantially to health disparities. However, whether
and how environmental/community social determinants influence patients’ psychosocial sequelae among those
receiving immunotherapy is unclear. Therefore, we propose investigating biological and social determinants of
psychosocial outcomes for HNC patients receiving immunotherapy. The findings from the study will be

1/1 U24 NADIA ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - SUMMARY
This is the second renewal of the Neurobiology of Adolescent Drinking in Adulthood (NADIA) Administrative
Core (NADIA Administrative Core-U24, RFA-AA-20-004). The Administrative Core provides organizational and
scientific leadership to achieve the goal of our Consortium: to elucidate persistent changes in complex brain
function-behavior relationships following adolescent alcohol exposure. Adolescent binge and extreme drinking
are common, and while many factors contribute to human brain development and alcohol use during adoles-
cence, animal models are critical for understanding the specific consequences of alcohol exposure on the
brain and behavior during this crucial developmental period. In the previous funding periods, the NADIA
discovered that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) led to multiple behavioral, neurochemical and
physiological patholo-gies in adulthood. Mechanistic studies revealed that these AIE-induced changes could
be prevented or re-versed by targeting specific neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, or epigenetic regulation
of genes. The Consortium has been very productive, as evidenced by our recent literature reviews and over
200 publications. To promote and facilitate continued progress, the NADIA Administrative Core is the main
organizational unit of the Consortium and serves as the liaison between the Scientific Core, the eight Research
Components, the NADIA Steering Committee, the External Advisory Board, and the NIAAA. The Administrative
Core organizes all Consortium activities including retreats, progress reports and External Advisory Board
evaluations of cores and components. The Administrative Core ensures consistent and forward progress by
facilitating communica-tion and promoting integration of data among the components and cores. The Core
develops scientific and conceptual themes as well as recommended operating procedures that cross
components. The Core provides a repository for all publications generated by the Consortium. Finally, the Core
facilitates dissemination and translation of NADIA-generated data, in part by targeted interactions with the
National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) and other alcohol research
groups. This NADIA renewal exactly fulfills the molecular mechanism and translation goals of this RFA leading
to development of therapeu-tic interventions of adult psychopathologies of adolescent alcohol consumption.
Understanding the impact of underage drinking on adult neurobiology is important to guide public health
initiatives, and the NADIA Adminis-trative Core creates synergies for such discoveries across the Consortium."

 Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is a small piece of a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein. It accumulates in
stages into microscopic amyloid plaques that are considered a hallmark of a brain affected by Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) is an established technique to detect Aβ plaques in vivo.
Some preclinical and postmortem data report an accumulation of redox-active iron near Aβ plaques.
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Aβ plaques has been attempted using various techniques, notably
with susceptibility contrast. The non-invasive detectability of Aβ plaques in MRI has so far been largely
attributed to iron deposition accompanying Aβ plaques. It is believed that the susceptibility shortening
effects of paramagnetic iron are the primary source of contrast between plaques and surrounding tissue. We
hypothesized that aggregations of iron associated Aβ would increase electron density and induce notable
changes in local susceptibility value. Due to higher susceptibility at ultra-high field (UHF) strengths, induced
iron susceptibility is large enough to generate contrast relative to surrounding normal tissues that can be
visualized by quantitative susceptibility techniques at 7 Tesla (7T) MRI.
 The goal of this proposal is to bring forward an alternative platform for analysis of pathologic
biomarkers in AD patients, thanks to ultrahigh field (7T) MR neuroimaging. The development of
specialized sequences for 7T susceptibility MRI will enable the comparison and microstructural data in AD
patients at an unprecedented resolution; this, in turn, will provide a deeper understanding of the in vivo
pathophysiology of AD and allow us to potentially identify a set of susceptibility-based markers of disease
pathology. Specifically, we expect our integrated approach to help us validate UHF MRI as a unique tool to
improve AD diagnosis and prognostic measurements. Our central hypothesis is that UHF MRI provides a
unique and powerful measure of changes associated with AD in the brain, and may be integrated with
existing neuroimaging tools to achieve unprecedented visualization of the consequences of disease
pathology.

10907730,"Project Summary:
Glioblastomas (GBM) are among the most lethal of all human cancers, with a median survival of around one
year. Vasogenic edema is a universal problem for GBM patients, and corticosteroids are commonly used
perioperatively to control cerebral edema and are frequently continued throughout subsequent treatment, notably
radiotherapy (RT), for the amelioration of side effects. Vasogenic edema is a significant cause of morbidity in
patients with both primary and metastatic brain tumors, both from the direct impact of edema and from indirect
effects related to the requirement for chronic corticosteroid use to manage it. In general, the mechanism of
edema formation is still unclear. We have shown that dexamethasone (DEX) administration significantly
compromises RT efficacy, together with emerging new therapies that augment the immune response to treat
brain tumors. Although we and others have identified antibodies and agents targeting vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) at high anti-cancer doses that effectively reduce edema, their use is associated with increased
infiltration of tumor growth-promoting macrophages and development of resistance. Our preliminary and
published work identified the pro-inflammatory IL-1β from blood-born monocyte/monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDM) as a downstream target of DEX in exerting its anti-edema effect. We have shown that targeting IL-1β is
as sufficient as DEX in reducing edema but does not compromise RT efficacy. In contrast to anti-VEGFA antibody
treatment, targeting IL-1β does not induce increased infiltration of tumor-promoting TAMs; on the contrary, it
decreases the number of tumor-promoting TAMs and reduces the number of exhausted CD8+ T-cells. This
application thus aims to use three distinct genetically engineered mouse models of GBM that exhibit significant
differences in TAMs and anatomical structures of the brain-blood barrier (BBB), together with human primary
GBM patient-derived xenograft models, in combination with cell type specific IL-1β ablation strategies to
determine detailed mechanisms of IL-1β effects on vascular permeability and edema formation in GBM. The
proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights into the fundamental cellular and molecular biology of IL-
1β in glioblastoma. The proposed studies test whether targeting IL-1β is a promising novel anti-edema therapy
for heterogeneous GBM with dual efficacy –against edema (in our renewal application) and neoplastic growth
that we demonstrated in our ongoing R01."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety disorders are the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses; national prevalence data indicate that
about 20% of adults in the US will be diagnosed. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the
most widely used treatments, yet 40% of patients do not respond. Despite decades of targeting serotonin, a
consensus on serotonin function and release dynamics is lacking. Consequently, how SSRI administration
modulates fine temporal dynamics of serotonin in relation to anxiety is largely unknown. Pharmacological
approaches, microdialysis, and chemogenetic manipulations have produced key insights, but none provide
millisecond resolution for serotonin release and correlates of specific reactions and behaviors until recently,
due to the development of two sensitive genetically encoded serotonin sensors (sLight and iSeroSnFR). I will
these sensors combined with fiber-photometry to optically measure behaviorally driven serotonin release in an
anxiogenic serotonin circuit with high temporal and spatial resolution.
The series of experiments outlined in this proposal are significant because they will: Aim 1) rigorously
demonstrate the in vivo utility of serotonin sensors in dissecting anxiety circuit, providing end users important
protocols and guidelines for fast technological implementation; Aim2) map dynamics of serotonin release in
anxiogenic circuits to anxiety behavior, and discover how activity in this circuit is impacted in anxious animals
and determine the mechanistic impacts of acute vs. chronic SSRI administration on anxiogenic serotonin
signaling; Aim 3) determine how testosterone impacts the efficacy of SSRI treatment.

 The hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to link events with their temporal and situational
contexts. This ability allows for memories to be truly autobiographical. Importantly, models suggest that the fate
of our memories is strongly inﬂuenced by latent reminders, reactivations, and retrievals – processes normally
invisible to the experimenter. The proposed research aims to illuminate the neural and cognitive mechanisms
underlying human episodic (contextually-mediated) memory through both computational modeling and the
analysis of intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings taken as neurosurgical patients and
healthy adults undergo virtual reality experiences and then search their memory for material studied therein.
 We will use a model-based approach coupled with multivariate pattern analysis applied to electrophysiological
data. Our ﬁrst aim is to elucidate how memory reactivation, driven by repetition of items or their contexts, shapes
subsequent recall and memory organization. We further seek to decode endogenous memory reactivation events
(rehearsal and replay) from neural data, and to determine their inﬂuence on subsequent recall behavior (Aim
2). Finally, we will connect memory retrieval and decision-making processes by investigating how behavioral
and neural retrieval dynamics shape value-based decision making. This work will serve as an important bridge
between the behavioral and neurobiological approaches to human memory."
10908495,"Influenza A virus (IAV) profoundly enhances the susceptibility of lung epithelial cells for pneumolysin-mediated
necroptosis. Briefly, pneumolysin is the pore-forming toxin produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn),
whereas necroptosis is a caspase-independent form of programmed cell death that results in cell lysis. Herein,
we will determine the molecular basis and full biological consequence of a new key observation: Spn binds to
necroptotic respiratory epithelial cells via Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA). Briefly, our
preliminary results show that PspA binds to host-derived (h)GAPDH on dying cells and this property directly
contributes to IAV/Spn disease severity. Furthermore, Spn/sloughed epithelial cell aggregates formed in the
nasopharynx likely promote Spn transmission to a naive host. Herein we test the hypothesis that during
IAV/Spn superinfection a high level of epithelial cell necroptosis occurs that promotes PspA-mediated
binding to cells. This property directly enhances Spn outgrowth and promotes Spn transmission.
AIM 1: Determine the molecular basis for PspA-mediated adhesion to necroptotic lung epithelial cells
(LEC). Spn adhesion to LEC is PspA-dependent, enhanced when cells undergo necroptosis, and mediated by
PspA binding to hGAPDH found on the surface of dying cells. We will identify the domain of PspA responsible
for hGAPDH binding, how conserved this domain is across sequenced strains of Spn, and the affinity of
representative PspA variants to hGAPDH. We will create and test the ability of isogenic mutants in the PspA
hGAPDH binding motif to bind dying LEC. We will identify the region of hGAPDH that is bound by PspA.
AIM 2: Determine the biological impact of PspA-mediated adhesion on IAV/Spn pneumonia severity.
PspA is required for the enhanced disease severity that occurs during IAV superinfection. We will determine if
hGAPDH binding alters the canonical role of PspA, which is inhibiting lactoferricin-mediated killing. We will
determine how PspA-binding influences the localization of Spn within the airway and how this is impacted by
co-infection with IAV, neutralization of pneumolysin, or blocking of necroptosis. We will determine if PspA-
mediated binding of Spn to dying LEC promotes their outgrowth in otherwise nutrient restricted conditions. We
will determine how antibody against the hGAPDH-binding motif of PspA alters overall disease progression.
AIM 3: Determine the requirement of PspA mediated adhesion to colonization and transmission. Spn
binds to dying mucosal epithelial cells during colonization and they are together expelled in nasal secretions.
Sloughed Spn/host cell aggregates are infectious and thought to promote Spn survival on fomites. We will
determine the requirement for PspA on the formation of Spn/host cell aggregates, moreover, how pneumolysin,
IAV superinfection, and necroptosis inhibition influences their number in secretions. We will determine the
requirement of PspA hGAPDH binding for transmission to a naive host. We will determine if antibody against
PspA and/or pneumolysin reduces transmission rates and shortens the length of colonization."
10908502,"ABSTRACT
While maternal severe morbidity and mortality increased significantly over recent decades, it is unclear to what
degree recommended safety practices for high-risk clinical scenarios are followed and reduce risk for adverse
maternal outcomes. A key strategy to reducing maternal risk has been implementation of `safety bundles' and
uniform protocols to standardize care for high-risk clinical conditions. While the standardized clinical measures
supported in these bundles are evidence based, there are major knowledge gaps related to implementation, care
quality surveillance, and outcomes assessment for safety protocols for postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive
diseases of pregnancy, sepsis, and grossly abnormal vital signs (maternal early warning systems). Obstetrical
care involves complex coordination of services, clinicians, and resources, and leadership are limited in their
ability to track outcomes and identify high quality care in real time at scale. Despite clear management
recommendations, maternal mortality and safety reviews have identified that deficiencies in care often occur
secondary to providers deviating from recommendations, systems issues including delayed identification and
response, and hospital-level effects where non-optimal practices are normalized. The degrees to which
guidelines are followed and adverse outcomes can be averted are not known, and many hospitals are limited in
their ability to systematically review care. Data collected from the electronic health record (EHR) may be
instantaneously analyzed to identify at-risk patients and complications and track care and management in large
populations. Prior EHR research on obstetric hemorrhage by our study group of over 40,000 delivery
hospitalizations demonstrated that adjusted odds for peripartum hysterectomy decreased by half after
implementation of a hemorrhage safety bundle. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that EHR data
can reliably identify clinical-management factors associated with failure to rescue in the setting of maternal
emergencies such as: (i) severe hypertension, (ii) obstetric hemorrhage, (iii) sepsis, and (iv) frankly abnormal
maternal vital signs (maternal early warnings systems). Failure to rescue is defined as a failure to prevent a
clinically important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from an underlying illness or a
complication of medical care. We will analyze to what degree care follows bundle recommendations and estimate
risk for failure to rescue when guidelines are not followed. We will leverage the richness of EHR data to
characterize provider behavior and risk stratify patients. Our study group includes expertise in informatics, clinical
research, perinatal epidemiology, decision analysis, and biostatistics. EHR data from eight hospitals in a
research consortium will be analyzed. We will characterize clinical management, outcomes, and care quality for
severe hypertension, obstetric hemorrhage, sepsis, and frankly abnormal vital signs. Data from these analyses
will be used for a number of simulations to inform development of clinical trials and interventions."

Lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of mortality for children under 5 years old1,2. Although
exposure to respiratory pathogens is common, very few children have severe or life-threatening disease3. A
better understanding of this inter-individual variability may allow us to more effectively prevent or treat serious
infections in those most at-risk. Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are rare monogenic diseases that serve as
‘experiments of nature’ to pinpoint genes and immune pathways critical to defense against specific pathogens.
However, despite the clear value that IEI research offers, IEI are vastly underdiagnosed. We investigated a
consanguineous family with two children affected by severe and recurrent bacterial respiratory infections
including Streptococcus pneumoniae. By whole exome sequencing we discovered these patients were
homozygous for the novel mutation N10Kfs*17 in TANK. We showed that this mutation leads to a complete loss
of TANK protein expression, indicating that we identified the first ever reported cases of TANK deficiency. TANK
is an adaptor protein assumed to participate in signaling pathways downstream of several immune receptors4,5.
However, its function in the human immune system remains largely unknown. To tackle this knowledge gap, we
performed in depth immunophenotyping of these patients’ samples. We found that TANK is critical for B cell
activation and differentiation, and production of immunoglobulins. Thus, we hypothesize that TANK is critical for
B cell activation and that genetic variants altering its pathway cause human diseases. Capitalizing on the unique
scientific opportunity that these patients offer we will characterize in depth the immunological consequences of
TANK deficiency (Aim 1). TANK has been implicated in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and mutations that
cause similar clinical and immunological consequences affect this pathway6–8. Hence, Aim 2 will focus on
deciphering the role of TANK in non-canonical NF-κB pathway signaling4,5. We have shown that we can leverage
knowledge from rare and high-impact genetic variants that cause IEI to understand how more frequent genetic
variants contribute to common immunological and infectious diseases9,10. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will take
advantage of our access to several large biorepositories of genetic data linked to de-identified electronic health
records to ascertain the impact of genetic variants in the TANK pathway on human disease phenotypes. The
work proposed in this application has far reaching clinical and immunological implications. We will characterize
the function of TANK in the human immune system, particularly its role in B cell activation and differentiation.
Our findings will showcase a novel mechanism of non-canonical NF-κB activation mediated by TANK. Finally,
we will unravel the consequences of genetic variants in TANK and its pathway in human diseases. In summary,
by studying a rare genetic disease we have recently identified, we will gain unique insights into the basic
mechanisms of human immunity and their relevance to human health."

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is uniquely curative for a variety of pediatric malignant and
non-malignant conditions. With respect to non-malignant conditions, due to the increasing use of DNA-based
screening and diagnostic testing, many of the genetic diseases that are curable by HCT are now identified early
in life. Accordingly, ~35% of all pediatric HCT procedures are performed for non-malignant diseases, which is
significantly higher than the proportion of non-malignant diseases for which HCT is performed for adults. HCT
approaches differ significantly between patients with malignant and non-malignant diseases. Those with
malignant conditions, in both children and adults, undergo extensive cytotoxic chemotherapy cycles, leading to
a compromised immune system and reduced capacity to reject donor cells. In contrast, patients with non-
malignant diseases, having not undergone prior chemotherapy, exhibit a spectrum of immune responses,
ranging from absence to hyper-activation, depending on the specific hematopoietic cell transplantation indication.
Thus, a more personalized HCT approach may benefit such patients. One of the major areas of unmet need for
personalized HCT arises from the fact that the metabolism of pre-HCT chemotherapy varies significantly across
individuals. This variation, in both weight-based and body surface area-based dosing, can lead to some patients
receiving too much or too little chemotherapy exposure, risking either toxicity or non-engraftment. Because of
this, the ideal situation might be one where pharmacokinetic modeling could be used to more accurately dose
patients, which would better balance immune suppression and toxicity. These and many other variables highlight
the unique needs of pediatric HCT recipients, making it a distinct discipline within the larger field of HCT. Further,
at any single transplant center, the number of children and young adults undergoing HCT is relatively small, and
the diseases treated are diverse, making it essential for centers to work together in a cooperative group setting.
For >30 years the Pediatric Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consortium (PTCTC) has been a pediatric
clinical trials consortium focused on bringing clinical trials to children and young adults with both malignant and
non-malignant diseases. The PTCTC is now the largest pediatric-focused HCT consortium in the world. In this
proposal we describe our plans and desire to continue to be a core clinical consortium (CCC) of the BMT CTN.
These include (A) Detailing our unique capabilities of the PTCTC within the BMT CTN; (B) Proposing a clinical
trial to optimize the conditioning regimen for children and adults with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI); and (C)
Describing the operational and scientific approach of the PTCTC to HCT trials, and how this approach could
benefit the BMT CTN. Together, our unique expertise, creativity, commitment to diversity, mentorship, and
innovative clinical trials underscores our potential to contribute significantly to the BMT CTN's objectives, and to
advance the HCT field."

The proposed study aims to reduce firearm-related deaths in children by scaling out an evidence-based secure
firearm storage intervention. The rate of firearm-related deaths increased by 41% from 2018-2021 across all
intents, and firearms are now the leading cause of death for youth ages 1-19. Secure firearm storage is a health
behavior that is critical for reducing unauthorized access to firearms and the risk of suicide, homicide, and
unintentional injuries. S.A.F.E. Firearm is an evidence-based intervention that includes (1) brief, parent-directed
discussion on secure firearm storage using a motivational interviewing and harm reduction approach and (2)
free cable locks offers to all parents during well child visits in pediatric primary care. Importantly, S.A.F.E. Firearm
has potential to save lives beyond primary care, and pediatric inpatient settings are an advantageous context for
S.A.F.E. Firearm implementation. Across the U.S. there are over 250 children's hospitals, approximately two
million children are hospitalized yearly, and parental engagement is a core feature of care. Moreover, hospitals
are essential settings for children disadvantaged by structural determinants and inadequate access to outpatient
services. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is a large, nonprofit pediatric health care system with two
freestanding children's hospitals in the greater Philadelphia region. Our team has pilot tested firearm safety
initiatives in the emergency department, select primary care sites, and the pediatric intensive care unit. Through
our formative work, we have identified bedside nurses as vital potential implementers. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we will adapt S.A.F.E. Firearm for the pediatric inpatient setting and nurse-led delivery using intervention
mapping. Anticipated products are an adapted intervention and optimized bundle of implementation strategies.
In Aim 2 we will conduct a parallel cluster randomized hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial across
two CHOP hospitals. Twelve inpatient nursing units will be randomized to receive adapted S.A.F.E. Firearm or
usual care, defined as routine clinical care plus free cable locks available in the hospital safety center. We will
test whether parents exposed to adapted S.A.F.E. Firearm report greater improvements in secure storage
(primary outcome) compared to parents exposed to usual care over one year of active implementation.
Secondary outcomes are additional firearm safety behaviors (e.g., firearm removal). We anticipate 14,400
eligible patient visits across the 12 units. Guided by the RE-AIM framework with equity considerations, we will
examine the effect of the implementation strategy bundle on S.A.F.E. Firearm outcomes in Aim 3. Our primary
implementation outcome is reach (i.e., electronic health record-documented program delivery). Secondary
outcomes include fidelity, acceptability, and maintenance. We will explore implementation strategy mechanisms
via qualitative interviews with nurses. Aligning with NINR priorities related to reducing injury inequities and
promoting population health, our findings will accelerate research translation and serve the broader goal of
reducing firearm-related mortality and improving health for children and their families."

Type 2 diabetes affects over 30 million people in the US and carries a high burden of cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality. Identifying new, modifiable mechanisms that may influence the development and macrovascular
complications of this multifactorial disease will make a substantial public health impact. This application will
investigate the associations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) with risks of incident diabetes and diabetes-associated
cardiovascular disease (CVD). H2S is a gasotransmitter that is crucial for cell signaling and cell function. In
addition, H2S appears to play an important role in the development of diabetes and mitigating the related
toxicities. In the pancreas, H2S regulates insulin secretion and protects beta cells from apoptosis. In the liver,
the main organ for the synthesis and storage of glucose, H2S reduces insulin resistance and improves glucose
uptake. In preclinical studies, compounds that release H2S, and therefore increase systemic concentrations,
protect from endothelial dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial injury and atherosclerosis in rodent
models of diabetes. Studies in humans are limited to cross-sectional studies showing a reduction in plasma
H2S in patients with type 2 diabetes. Prospective studies are needed to bridge the gap between pre-clinical
studies and future clinical trials. Therefore we propose to conduct efficient case-cohort and longitudinal studies
of H2S, diabetes and CVD. We hypothesize that higher levels of H2S in plasma are associated with lower risks
of incident diabetes and diabetes-associated CVD; and we hypothesize that cellular H2S levels protects human
hepatic and cardiomyocyte from insulin resistance and the resulting cellular dysfunction. To test these
hypotheses, we will measure circulating H2S levels in existing samples from two prospective cohorts and
examine H2S associations with type 2 diabetes and diabetes-associated CVD (Aim 1). Importantly, in Aim 2,
we supplement these observational studies with functional experimental studies in human derived cell lines to
investigate the molecular mechanism of H2S hepatic and cardiac protection in insulin resistance, and to
discover novel H2S-regulated pathways that may lead to future targets for the prevention of diabetes and
CVD."

The rapid increase in the incidence of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), its malignant form esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC), and junctional gastric cancer has produced serious health and financial burdens in the U.S. Thus far,
effective treatment options for these diseases are limited in part due to an incomplete understanding of the
molecular mechanisms driving the initial metaplasia and subsequent neoplastic progression. This application, by
two PIs with complementary expertise, seeks to address the issue through combining scRNA-sequencing analysis,
innovative BE mouse models and organoid modeling. We previously demonstrated that gastric cardia progenitor
cells and transitional basal cell (TBCs) contribute to BE in the transitional zone of the gastro-esophageal junction
(GEJ). However, how these progenitor cells behave in BE-dysplasia-EAC progression remains unclear.
Additionally, the molecular mechanism driving the disease progression is also unknown. Our preliminary data
suggest GEJ metaplasia and its progression towards EAC involves progenitor plasticity facilitated by p53 loss,
an early genetic lesion in BE. Furthermore, we found that Barrett’s metaplasia and EAC is associated with the
enrichment of tuft cells. Therefore we hypothesize that Barrett’s metaplasia and dysplasia originate from GEJ
progenitor cells, modulated by the presence of p53 mutation and tuft cell expansion. Three specific aims are
formulated to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 is to determine the origins and evolution of BE metaplasia from
progenitor cells at the EGJ. Aim 2 is to elucidate the mechanisms by which p53 mutation promotes BE
progression, and Aim 3 is to clarify the role of tuft cells in BE pathogenesis and progression. Combining our joint
expertise on mouse genetics, cell biology, chromatin biology and epigenomics, this work will provide novel
mechanistic insights into the mechanisms underlying Barrett’s metaplasia and its malignant progression, offering
new approaches to treat these diseases."

Physical access of DNA has been widely studied using multiple chromatin accessibility profiling methods,
including DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, MNase-seq and NOMe-seq. These studies have revealed the accessible
genome largely overlaps with cis- DNA regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters, highlighting a
prominent role of chromatin-binding factors in establishing chromatin accessibility. However, recent chromatin
conformation imaging studies have suggested that higher-order chromatin organization can also impact
accessibility of DNA through packing. A pressing question is whether native chromatin packing conformation
regulates chromatin accessibility in living cells. The current technology is not suitable to resolve this issue
because of their technical limitations that alter the native configuration and biophysical features of higher-order
chromatin. Thus, our objective is to develop a new approach to quantitively measure chromatin accessibility
under native conditions in live cells. In this project, we will leverage the recently developed iLID-SspB optogenetic
module to design a light-controlled molecule probe for measuring the accessibility of local chromatin
conformation in live cells. In Aim 1, we will develop a pair of optically controlled chromatin accessibility probes,
composed of MNase-mClover3-SspB tracer and iLID-mRuby3-H2B anchor. Upon validation and optimization,
we will establish an experimental system that combine the optical genetic control with high throughput DNA
sequencing to probe the native accessible chromatin conformation. In Aim 2, we will apply this technology named
OMAC-seq (Optical Mapping of Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing) and develop a computational pipeline
to measure cell differentiation-coupled changes of chromatin conformation in live embryonic stem cells. In Aim
3, we will develop a mitosis-specific OMAC-seq toolkit to quantify accessible genome DNA in mitotic
chromosome. By completing these aims, the proposed OMAC-seq technology will be an enabling toolkit for
understanding the impact of higher order chromatin on genome accessibility."

on predicted risk of relapse. The presence of residual cancer cells after induction chemotherapy, known as
minimal residual disease (MRD), is a highly significant prognostic variable. However, many patients not
considered to be “high risk” still experience relapse. There is an unmet need to develop novel risk models
with enhanced accuracy to enable allocation of patients to risk-adapted therapies to reduce the
likelihood of future relapse. Our prior genomics studies on relapsed ALL in protein-coding regions (~2% of the
human genome) have revealed novel insights on the drivers of resistance to therapy. While these findings have
potential for developing novel molecular risk models, significant knowledge gaps remain. First, more than 50%
of relapsed cases lack any known resistance drivers. Second, the known resistance drivers are derived from
retrospective studies of relapsed specimens and it is unclear how to apply such information prospectively from
initial diagnosis to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Our goal is to develop novel molecular risk models by
tracking resistance drivers at diagnosis. Our central hypothesis is that resistance drivers, when detected at
diagnosis, will be informative for allocation of patients to risk-adapted therapies. We will test our hypothesis in
three aims. In Aim 1, we will identify comprehensive resistance drivers from both protein-coding and non-coding
regions by leveraging a large cohort of 669 relapsed childhood ALL cases from a recently completed cooperative
clinical trial with genome and transcriptome sequencing data available. We hypothesize that unexplored non-
coding regions will harbor novel resistance drivers and that the large cohort size will empower the discovery of
rare resistance drivers. In Aim 2, we will backtrack the resistance drivers at diagnosis by using ultra-deep
sequencing coupled with state-of-the-art computational error suppression that will enable detection of rare
variants with frequency as low as 0.01%. In Aim 3, we will investigate if resistance drivers pre-exist in an
independent cohort of patients at diagnosis. We will develop novel molecular risk models by comparing
prevalence profiles of resistance drivers detected at initial diagnosis between patients who have relapsed and
those who are cured. Successful completion of our project aims will deliver 1) comprehensive knowledge of
drivers of resistance to therapy, 2) the full spectrum of pre-existing resistance drivers at diagnosis, and 3) novel
molecular risk models for decreasing the risk of relapse. Our deliverables will form the basis for future clinical
trials and for developing novel therapeutic agents aimed at improving the cure rate of childhood ALL."
10911981,"ABSTRACT – Project 2, Patterns of Care and Care Transitions in AYA Cancer Survivors
 Each year, almost 70,000 AYAs aged 15-39 years are diagnosed with cancer in the United States, yet
little is known about their patterns of post-treatment healthcare utilization, care experiences, or patient-reported
outcomes. Prior research demonstrates that AYA survivors may experience multiple challenges during post-
treatment care, including poor continuity of care, inadequate patient-provider communication, and receipt of
suboptimal post-treatment healthcare services despite available national clinical care guidelines. To advance
research, impact clinical guidelines, and improve AYA cancer care, we need evidence on patterns of care,
patient healthcare experiences and barriers to care, and patient-reported outcomes among AYA
survivors, particularly during the transition to early survivorship. To address gaps in current knowledge,
our project aims to: 1) evaluate patterns of outpatient, emergency, and inpatient service utilization among AYA
survivors and determine variations by patient-, provider-, and system-level factors; 2) examine patient-reported
care experiences and barriers to care, focusing on perceived coordination of care and communication with
providers; and 3) determine the relationship between receipt of guideline-concordant outpatient services and
patient-reported outcomes. We will leverage data from AYA survivors 2–5 years post diagnosis from
integrated healthcare systems, state-based data resources, and patient surveys. In Aim 1, we will use data
from >60,000 AYA survivors from five large-scale geographically diverse data resources, including Kaiser
Permanente Northern and Southern California (KPNC, KPSC) electronic health records and research
databases, the California and Utah Cancer Registries linked to corresponding state hospitalization databases,
and linked data from the North Carolina Cancer Registry and administrative claims. We will use these
population-based data to evaluate patterns of care among individuals diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 with
the 10 most common AYA-onset cancers. In Aim 2, we will use data from the P01 Survey of 5,000 AYA
cancer survivors from KPNC, KPSC, and North Carolina populations to describe care experiences 2–5 years
post diagnosis. In Aim 3, we will determine concordance of post-treatment care for four cancer types
(N=6,281) with national guidelines and evaluate the association of guideline-concordant care measured
through KPNC and KPSC electronic databases with patient-reported survey-based outcomes. This innovative
study will be among the first to examine the transition to early survivorship care in a large and diverse AYA
population. Our project aims and analyses are central to our P01 program and complement other projects
through focus on similar cancer sites in subgroup analyses (Project 1, 3) and by providing datasets classifying
guideline concordance for other analyses (Project 3). Collectively, our results will advance the state of AYA
research, inform clinical guidelines, and provide actionable findings for patient-, provider-, and system-level
interventions to improve care quality and outcomes among AYA cancer survivors."
10911982,"ABSTRACT – Project 3, Late Effects in the AYA Cancer Population
 Few studies have evaluated long-term medical outcomes in US survivors of adolescent and young
(AYA) cancers, a population with among the greatest number of life-years affected by cancer. Studies on AYA
survivors find elevated risks of medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and second cancers, but typically
do not consider treatment in detail or examine results by clinical or patient factors to identify those at higher
risk for late effects and poorer survival. This limited research hinders creating long-term care guidelines and
interventions to improve health outcomes in this population. To address these evidence gaps, we propose a
detailed examination of clinical care factors and their association with late effects in AYA cancer survivors
using integrated P01 data resources: the clinical and research infrastructure of Kaiser Permanente (KP); the
population-based California Cancer Registry (CCR) and Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), both linked to statewide
healthcare data; and survey data from ~5,000 AYAs with cancer, including from North Carolina. The KP
Northern California (KPNC) and Southern California (KPSC) integrated healthcare systems provide
comprehensive healthcare services and use electronic health records that facilitate investigating late effects of
cancer and its treatment. The CCR-hospitalization are from linking one of the largest, most diverse U.S.
cancer registries with statewide hospitalization, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery data. The
UCR-hospitalization are from similar sources for many rural and medically underserved residents. With these
diverse resources, this study will assess chronic medical conditions and late effects (collectively called late
effects) in AYA cancer survivors and will: 1) determine the incidence of late effects, examining how risks vary
by primary cancer type, specific treatment approaches, race/ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status,
and health insurance coverage; 2) examine how guideline-concordant survivorship care and inpatient and
outpatient visits to multiple provider types are associated with the risk of late effects; and 3) evaluate the
influence of patient-reported barriers to care on late effects. We will use a cohort of ~53,000 AYAs diagnosed
with cancer from 2006 through 2019 in California; ~13,000 will have been diagnosed and treated at KPNC or
KPSC. Data from KPNC, KPSC and California hospitals allows medical outcome follow-up of AYA cancer
survivors who leave or seek coverage outside the KP system and facilitates comparisons between those
seeking care within and outside an integrated care system for late effects requiring hospitalization. Our
analyses will be enhanced by approximately 8,400 AYAs from Utah, of whom ~1,700 are rural residents. We
hypothesize a higher burden of late effects among AYAs with care barriers such as insurance and financial
concerns that impact both initial and survivorship care. Results from this project will inform evidence-based
guidelines on prevention and surveillance of late effects among AYAs with cancer by characterizing disparities
and unique barriers to receipt of necessary care and lead to strategies to mitigate the impact of late effects."

 Strong biostatistical leadership and expertise are integral to achieving scientific integrity of research
data and analytical results, and are indispensable for assuring confidence in the potential clinical or public
health impact of research activities. The primary goal of Core B, the Biostatistics and Data Harmonization
Shared Resource, is to oversee and guide all aspects of study design, data management and data analysis
across all three P01 projects so the scientific aims of each project are addressed using standardized, high-
quality datasets and the most appropriate statistical methods. We have a strong team of biostatisticians,
programmer/analysts and investigators with extensive experience using the P01 data and population
resources. Our resources include the California and Utah Cancer Registries linked to hospitalization,
emergency and ambulatory surgery data; the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Cancer Information &
Population Health Resource; the integrated healthcare systems of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and
Southern California; and survey data on a population subset. The varying data sources present several
challenges in cleaning, analysis and interpretation, including the potential for reverse causation and various
forms of selection bias. Biostatistical consultation provided by the Core will ensure the appropriate application
of approaches to determine the potential magnitude of such biases and methods to account for them. The
specific aims of the Core are to:
 1. Provide overall biostatistical leadership, consultation and support across all three P01 projects and
 Core C, the Survey Shared Resource;
 2. Carry out cohort identification to meet the subject inclusion criteria for each aim of each project and for
 the survey described in Core C;
 3. Harmonize and standardize variable definitions used across data sources and projects;
 4. Construct and provide study analytic datasets that incorporate data from clinical and administration
 data sources, cancer registries, and patient surveys;
 5. Oversee analyses using appropriate methods to achieve the aims of each project, including
 consideration of systematic biases, potential confounders, and sampling weights in the analysis of
 survey data.
 To carry out the objectives of this P01, centralized biostatistical expertise and services will ensure use
of common concepts and data definitions throughout the P01. This Core will ensure that data are appropriate
for the questions addressed, harmonized across source data systems to enhance comparability, and analyzed
and interpreted with knowledge of strengths and limitations. This strategy will maximize the potential impact of
P01 findings to inform and improve healthcare for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors."
10911988,"ABSTRACT – Core C, Survey Shared Resource
 Data on cancer care experiences and patient-reported outcomes of adolescent and young adult (AYA)
cancer survivors cannot be captured from administrative, cancer registry, or electronic health record data.
Therefore, the primary goal of the Survey Core is to collect high-quality patient-reported information for all P01
projects to support completion of their specific aims and objectives. We will use efficient, evidence-based and
psychometrically-sound methods to collect data and support projects in analyzing and interpret these data. To
ensure success, the Survey Core team includes investigators with epidemiologic, health services, and
psychometric research backgrounds and strong survey design experience related to cancer survivorship,
patient care experiences, and patient-reported outcomes. The Core Specific Aims are to:
 1. Design a survey that will support and enhance the aims and objectives for all projects,
 2. Field the survey among 5,000 AYA survivors who are 2-10 years post diagnosis,
 3. Provide cleaned survey data to Core B (Biostatistics and Data Harmonization Shared Resource), and
 4. Assist Core B and projects in creating analytic datasets and using and interpreting survey data.
 The source population for the survey will be AYA cancer survivors, 2-10 post diagnosis, at Kaiser
Permanente Northern California and Southern California healthcare systems and the State of North Carolina.
The Survey Core will centrally recruit and administer the survey to a stratified random sample of survivors
identified at all sites. Eligible survey respondents (12,500 invitees for 5,000 responses) must have been
diagnosed at 15-39 years with one of the following 10 most common AYA cancers: breast, thyroid, melanoma,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular, leukemia, cervical, sarcoma, or colorectal. The survey
will include validated and published measures as well as new measures designed for this study, based on
qualitative interviews; we will pilot test the survey and conduct psychometric analyses before finalizing. The
Survey Core will field the survey following evidence-based survey design methods (Dillman’s Tailored Design
approach) including a pre-incentive, multiple modes of contact (email, mail, phone), mixed survey modes (web,
paper, and telephone), and an incentive for completion. We will use a comprehensive survey research
management system to ensure timely and accurate tracking of survey participants (and nonresponders and
refusers) and real-time reporting to maximize response rate and data quality. The Survey Core will perform
quality assurance checks on all modes of data collection and return cleaned data to Core B, including
dispositions (e.g., refusals, nonresponse) for appropriately weighting survey responses in analyses. The
Survey Core will provide input on analysis plans that use patient-reported data. Survey Core investigators will
participate in interpreting project findings and manuscript preparation. Centralizing all survey activities will
ensure efficient and synergistic data collection across this program of research in AYA cancer survivors."
10912495,"Project Summary/ Abstract: Lymphatic diseases are numerous and affects upwards of 200 million people
worldwide. These chronic disorders have limited clinical management and are broadly characterized by aberrant
lymphatic vessel development and/or dysfunction which results in painful accumulation of interstitial fluid.
Shockingly, no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments targeting lymphangiogenesis, the process of
lymphatic vessel formation, are available. Thus, there is an urgent need to characterize key therapeutically
tractable proteins and signaling pathways that regulate lymphangiogenesis. The Caron laboratory studies one
such molecule, the potent pro-lymphangiogenic peptide, adrenomedullin (AM). AM-induced lymphangiogenesis
requires formation of well-controlled AM-chemotactic gradients to provide directionality to growing and migrating
lymphatic vessel tips. The atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) is critical for the establishment of these
gradients through the internalization and degradation of AM. Recently, the Caron laboratory identified a novel
interaction between ACKR3 and receptor-activity-modifying protein 3 (RAMP3). They showed in vitro that
RAMP3 is required for the recycling of ACKR3 to the plasma membrane after AM-stimulated internalization and
that loss of ACKR3 or RAMP3 in vivo results in impaired vascular development. However, the mechanism by
which RAMP3 regulates ACKR3 activity and signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and the process of
lymphangiogenesis remains unknown. RAMP3 is unique among the RAMPs in that it contains a C-terminal PDZ
motif that mediates its function by promoting protein-protein interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins.
Therefore, the overarching hypothesis of this training proposal is that RAMP3 and its PDZ motif enhances
ACKR3 activity and signaling within LECs to regulate lymphangiogenesis. Completion of this proposal will define
the role of RAMP3 in the regulation of ACKR3 signaling and lymphangiogenesis, thereby advancing the current
knowledge of the lymphatic biology field. In addition, this proposal will provide invaluable experience and training
in the performance of ethical and rigorous research and effective scientific communication."

Sulfur mustard (SM) and nitrogen mustard (NM) are potent chemical threats that cause damage to the cornea,
including acute photophobia and corneal lesions followed by loss of limbal stem cells (LSCs) and prolonged
ulceration and vascularization. Therapeutic approaches targeting both the acute and prolonged phases of
SM/NM toxicity can potentially provide effective measures to counteract corneal injuries. We provide novel
findings that support the benefits of MG53, a tissue repair protein, in treating vesicant-induced corneal wounds.
Compared with wild type mice, mg53-/- littermates show delayed corneal re-epithelialization, increased
vascularization and conjunctivatization following NM exposure, all hallmarks of LSC deficiency. Further,
transgenic mice with sustained elevation of MG53 are resistant to NM-induced corneal injury. We find that the
recombinant human MG53 protein (rhMG53) protects against injury to LSCs and corneal epithelial cells to
preserve cornea integrity during NM exposure. We also know that MG53 protein is naturally present in the tear
film and aqueous humor, supporting the physiology of MG53 in corneal homeostasis and the safe nature of using
rhMG53 to treat corneal injuries. The goal of this U01 project is to develop rhMG53 as a potential effective protein
therapeutic to mitigate the acute and prolonged phases of vesicant corneal injury. We will formulate rhMG53 for
ocular application as a first-aid medicine that can be stockpiled as a medical reserve and rapidly deployed to
affected patients in the event of chemical threats. In vitro and ex vivo studies will be performed to elucidate the
mechanistic action of MG53 in protecting against NM-induced injury to LSCs and corneal epithelia. Validation
studies will be conducted with rhMG53 in mouse and rabbit models of vesicant-induced corneal injuries to
determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety windows of rhMG53 in rescuing cornea function. Overall, this U01
program provides a unique opportunity to advance the biology of MG53 into an important counteract therapeutic."

a combined effort of the Wilmer Eye Institute (Department of Ophthalmology) and the
Departments of Neuroscience, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Biology, and Institute of Genetic
Medicine. The program, administered and directed by PI Donald Zack and co-directors Jeremy
Nathans and Amer Riazuddin, provides a multidisciplinary training platform with a diverse
faculty covering cover many of the major avenues of modern visual science. The goal of the
program is to recruit young, talented scientists into the visual sciences, and to provide them with
broad theoretical and methodological research training, which will allow them to contribute to
our understanding of the biology of vision and the pathological mechanisms responsible for
visual loss in the context of human disease. Johns Hopkins is fortunate to have a large number
of investigators exploring different avenues of vision research; their approaches range from the
molecular and cellular to the systems levels, and the technologies they employ include cell
biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, developmental neurobiology, stem cell biology,
electrophysiology, functional imaging, psychophysics, bioinformatics, genomics, and genetics.
This diverse vision research community provides a wide variety of research options for VSTP
trainees. In this VSTP renewal application, we are proposing to accept two predoctoral students
per year and support both of them for two years, and to accept two postdoctoral fellows per
year, and to support each of them for one year. As part of our training program, the VSTP, in
collaboration with Wilmer Eye Institute and other Hopkins graduate programs, organizes and
provides vision-related courses, seminars, and related activities. Additional training in the
problems of clinical ophthalmology, with an emphasis on translational problem solving, is
available to all VSTP trainees through the medical student ophthalmology program and grand
rounds. Through these programs, we hope to continue and expand upon the VSTP’s success in

10910441,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Recognition of peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) by T cell
receptors is a fundamental molecular mechanism by which T cells sense and respond to foreign antigens such
as viral proteins and mutant oncoproteins. Yet many cancer-specific antigens are poorly presented by common
MHC alleles, greatly limiting the ability of T cells to be mobilized against patient tumors. Methods to increase
the MHC-I presentation of cancer specific oncogenic driver mutations could greatly augment anti-cancer immune
responses. Conversely, misrecognition of self-antigens by T cells breaks the immune tolerance and leads to the
destruction of healthy tissue, a process that underlies multiple autoimmune diseases. Genetic studies have
revealed strong linkages between specific MHC alleles and autoimmune disease risk (e.g. HLA-
B*27:05/ankylosing spondylitis, HLA-DQ2/celiac disease and type 1 diabetes), providing a strong rationale to
therapeutically target these MHC alleles. Although MHC proteins have not been targeted by small molecule
drugs, recent studies on idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions uncovered the propensity of MHC proteins
to accommodate drug-like compounds. Here we seek to exploit this understanding to develop small molecule
ligands of MHC proteins for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. By leveraging a new high
throughput assay we have established to monitor compound stabilization of MHC proteins as well as their
covalent reactivity, we propose to develop small molecules that 1) enhance the presentation of cancer antigens
by MHC Class I proteins via a molecule glue mechanism, 2) block the antigen presentation by autoimmune-
associated MHC Class I proteins, and 3) allosterically perturb the function of autoimmune-associated MHC Class
II proteins. The proposed research program will deliver novel chemical matter to enable new therapeutic
mechanisms for cancer and autoimmune diseases. In addition, the methods we develop here will lay the
foundation for the systematic discovery of small molecules that modulate of MHC-mediated antigen presentation."

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Integrated Translational Oncology Program (UNC-iTOP) is a
T32 training program focused on training clinicians (MD/DOs), basic scientists (PhDs), and PhD, MD and MD-
PhD candidates in clinical/translational disease based research at the interface of clinical oncology and cancer
biology using patient samples. We have recruited preceptors/faculty with broad interests who are committed to
improving translational oncology and tissue-based research. Led by two physician-scientists with
complementary expertise in tissue-based research, clinically applicable preclinical models, and clinical trials,
UNC-iTOP has recruited preceptors/faculty who are leaders in their fields. The UNC-iTOP faculty includes
members with expertise in translational research focusing on biomarkers of cancer and novel therapies and
interventions for patients. All UNC-iTOP faculty have approved IRB protocols and have led prospective clinical
protocols and/or trials.
Sustained support for UNC-iTOP will enable the continued successful proactive, energetic and sustained
efforts to identify, recruit and train promising MD/DO, PhD, and MD-PhD investigators for research careers that
will address the knowledge gap in tissue-based translational oncology research. Translational oncology tissue-
based research has been critically important for the identification of key drivers of cancer initiation, progression
and metastasis. Identifying treatments that target the vulnerabilities at each stage continues to be a broad area
of need. Evaluating new therapies in relevant models with more stringent metrics is key to translating findings
to the clinic. Validating findings in patients is the overarching goal. To succeed in each area requires a
fundamental understanding of the workings of the healthcare and clinical protocol/regulatory system that
supports cutting edge research. UNC-iTOP appointed its first trainee class in July 2020, and will continue to
provide a unique, dynamic, and comprehensive training program for MD/DO, MD-PhD and PhD trainees
committed to translational oncology and tissue-based research. We recognize that translational oncology
research involves numerous disciplines and successful advances are the result of interdisciplinary teams. The
UNC-iTOP focuses on integrating the “basic”, “clinical”, and “regulatory” teams early on with the overarching
goal to develop a cadre of translational scientists (both MD/DO/MD-PhDs and PhDs) who will be the next
generation of leaders in the field of oncology research."
10911034,"Tinnitus and hearing loss have been the #1 and #2 disabilities at the VA since
2006. Costs to the VA in excess of billions of dollars in disability payments include
health care visits, cost of hearing aids, and remedial therapies, including cognitive
behavioral therapy. Personal cost to the Veteran involves loss of employability, lost
productivity at work, reduced quality of life, as well as sleep difficulties and diminished
cognition. One reason that no effective treatment has been identified may be the large
heterogeneity in the Veteran population with respect to etiology, exposures, genetics,
and clinical phenotype.
 Our group published the first large genome-wide-association study (GWAS) for
tinnitus), identifying genomic variants and establishing tinnitus as a heritable, polygenic
disorder. We have curated the largest collection of data of tinnitus and hearing-related
phenotypes, comprising diverse populations with a wide range of acoustic exposure,
age, and ancestry. We now wish to continue this highly productive project to increase
gene discovery and further dissect the genomic landscape of tinnitus and hearing loss.
Specifically, the divergent anatomic and genomic pathways for tinnitus from hearing
damage remains unidentified.
 In Aim I we propose to expand and refine phenotyping for tinnitus using more
stringent criteria than self-report, i.e., disability ratings and clinical diagnoses. For the
first time in a large GWAS, we will use objective measures of hearing based on >
350,000 audiograms in MVP such as principal components and a speech intelligibility
index (SII). We will characterize exposure measures, comorbid disorders associated
with tinnitus, risk factors, and covariates for multi-trait GWAS. Aim 2 will use our
established pipeline to perform GWAS, including meta-analysis on MVP and UKB with
replication in external cohorts. In addition, we will optimize the contribution of diverse
ancestries to identify causal variants and ensure that our understanding of auditory
genetics extends across ancestries represented in MVP. We will identify tinnitus
subtypes using the multi-trait analysis from Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will perform post-GWAS
functional analysis including transcriptomic imputation association (TWAS) to predict
transcriptomic variation in relevant brain and cochlear tissues. In Aim 4, we will dissect
the shared and distinct genetic underpinnings of tinnitus, hearing loss, and loss of
speech intelligibility to improve risk prediction. We Will analyze genetic correlations of
auditory phenotypes with other disorders. In addition, we will evaluate polygenic risk
scores (PRS) to better predict risk of tinnitus clinically.
 Successful completion of these aims will identify relevant variants, genes, and
pathways, advance our knowledge of the genetic basis of tinnitus, dissect its relationship
to hearing loss, and expand findings to diverse populations exposed to a range of
environmental acoustic trauma. Our findings will provide a foundation for future
neurobiological work and direct future pharmaceutical research aiming at effective
treatment for this pervasive disorder."
10911035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-growing cause of cancer death in the U.S. and it is
projected to be the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. by 2040 given the poor effectiveness of current
HCC risk stratification and early detection strategies. Specifically, HCC screening is recommended in all patients
with cirrhosis, despite annual HCC risk varying between 1-4%/year, highlighting a need for risk stratification
biomarkers. HCC screening is performed using abdominal ultrasound and the serum biomarker alpha fetoprotein
(AFP); however, this strategy misses over one-third of HCCs at an early stage and results in screening harms in
many patients. The goal of our Clinical Validation Center for HCC (CVC-HCC) is to validate novel blood and
imaging biomarkers in phase I-III studies to improve HCC risk stratification and early detection.
Translation of HCC biomarkers to practice has been hampered by a dearth of high-quality sample sets including
both stored blood and imaging. Existing sample sets also primarily include patients with cirrhosis from active
viral hepatitis, with limited applicability to contemporary populations who primarily have cured viral hepatitis or
non-viral causes of liver disease. Our CVC will create a contemporary resource with blood and imaging data to
allow for rapid validation of promising biomarkers for HCC risk-stratification and early detection in phase I-III
studies. A specific population in need of better biomarkers is patients with indeterminate liver nodules (ILNs) on
diagnostic CT or MRI, which are observed in over one-fourth of patients undergoing HCC screening and have a
high, yet variable, risk for developing into HCC (annual risk ~6-10%/year). Our group has validated a novel blood-
based biomarker, PLSec, for risk stratification and a biomarker panel, GALAD, for early HCC detection in patients
with cirrhosis and herein propose to perform a phase II-III biomarker study to evaluate them in patients with ILNs.
Our team includes national leaders in HCC screening, imaging, and biomarker validation. We are leading efforts
to evaluate HCC biomarkers including the EDRN-funded Hepatocellular Early Detection Strategy (HEDS) Study,
NCI-funded Translational Liver Cancer (TLC) Consortium, and CPRIT-funded Texas HCC Consortium. We will
leverage existing infrastructure across five health systems to create two novel resources not offered by the
current sample sets including (1) a biorepository with both blood and imaging data from patients, with and without
HCC, representing contemporary etiologies of liver disease for Phase II studies and (2) a prospective cohort of
patients with ILNs to evaluate HCC risk stratification and early detection biomarkers in Phase III studies using a
prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. We will work with the BCCs

Gliomas account for 80% of all malignant brain tumors and have an extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year
survival of 5.1%. The etiology of glioma remains poorly understood, with few established modifiable risk factors.
Multiple studies have implicated infections in the development of glioma, however the underlying mechanisms
and putative causal pathogens remain unclear. In addition to risk, there is also accumulating evidence from
studies investigating novel therapeutics suggesting that immune response to infection may be prognostic in
glioma patients. Previous epidemiologic studies have investigated a limited number of pathogens using
serological assays that only allowed detection. We seek to conduct a large serologic study measuring 41
antigens from all 12 infections previously associated with glioma using assays that provide quantitative measures
of antibody response. Our study will include 1000 glioma case-control pairs with extensive clinical and
epidemiologic data. In Aim 1 we will estimate the effect of each individual infection on glioma risk and survival
and also examine grouped patterns of co-infections. In Aim 2, we will employ innovative long read sequencing
technology to detail all polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II genes in the same set of
subjects. Genetic variation in the HLA region plays a pivotal role in regulating immune response to viral challenge
and has been previously linked to glioma risk and progression. We will investigate a range of functional HLA
polymorphisms, including antigen-presenting classical alleles and amino acid residues, with respect to glioma
risk and survival. In Aim 3, we will integrate serological and HLA sequencing data to delineate host genetic
mechanisms of immune response to infection and subsequent effects on glioma endpoints. This will allow us to
develop comprehensive immunogenomic models for predicting glioma risk and survival. Taken together, the
proposed study will contribute new, high-quality data that will significantly advance our understanding of glioma
pathogenesis, as well as inform avenues for prevention and improvement of outcomes in glioma patients."

Pediatric chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a serious public health problem resulting in high levels of healthcare utilization and disability. Youth with CWP also frequently report exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; abuse/neglect, violent/conflictual home environment, etc.) and a significant subset continue to experience physical and psychosocial impairment long-term. Certain mind-body interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or meditation may be particularly appropriate for youth with CWP as they have been shown to modulate stress-induced maladaptation of the HPA-axis, autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular system, and brain structure (e.g., hippocampus). However, it is currently unknown if these targets are affected in youth with CWP. Preliminary research indicates that allostatic load (AL), or “wear and tear” on the nervous system due to stress, may contribute to pain chronicity. Similarly, evidence suggests that the hippocampus, a brain structure that is among the most deleteriously affected by stress, plays a role in pain perception. However, no study to-date has examined AL and hippocampal functioning in relation to stress exposure in youth with CWP. Mind-body interventions such as MBSR or meditation are an important and safe therapy option for both pain and stress reduction in youth with CWP and may modulate the negative impact of ACEs, so there is a critical need to know if these mechanisms are engaged in this population. The proposed research project utilizes multifactorial physiological and neuroimaging measurement techniques to enhance our understanding of the potential role of these mechanisms in pain-related impairment and responsiveness to mind-body interventions over time. The aims of this submission are to better characterize AL, assessed via a multifactorial composite, and hippocampal functioning via fMRI in pediatric CWP as specific targets for mind-body interventions that can lead to treatment optimization and improved compliance. The long-term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to establish an independent research career aimed at carrying out mechanistically informed mind-body interventions. Chronic widespread pain was selected as a model condition because of its commonality within pediatric pain clinics and strong association with central sensitization, high stress, psychological impairment, and functional disability. The primary training objectives are to acquire expertise in neurobiological measurement and interpretation and to leverage current research activities in complement to this proposal that will lay the foundation for future mechanistically driven clinical trial grant submissions as an independent investigator. The candidate will accomplish this through: 1) mentorship in a clinical/research environment, 2) hands-on training in the neurobiological measurement of the physiological effects of stress, complemented by didactics in neuroendocrine and fMRI measurement, 3) mentorship and coursework in advanced data analytic techniques, 4) leveraging psychosocial practice activities and clinical trial involvement in conjunction with effort on the proposed award, and 5) execution of the proposed research plan and submission of an independent investigator award application. These studies and training will provide the necessary data to inform the development of an R01 clinical trial designed to test the physiological mechanism(s) of response to MBSR, meditation, and other non-pharmacological techniques in youth with CWP."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The highest incidence rates of cervical cancer (CC) are in sub-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia and South
America. In the United States (U.S.), CC ranks 14th in frequency. However, in certain populations and geographic
areas of the U.S., CC incidence and death rates are significantly higher, due in part to racial and ethnic disparities
in access, utilization, and quality of care, all of which contribute to worse health outcomes. Black women
experience a disparate burden of CC incidence and mortality, having a higher risk of being diagnosed with and
dying from CC than non-Hispanic White women. Appropriate and timely CC screening is a key factor in
prevention. Leveraging the positive benefits of CC screening may reduce the CC disparate burden among
Blacks. Research studies typically treat Blacks as a homogeneous group, despite differences within this
population. To begin to address a gap in the literature within the scope of a career development award, this
study focuses specifically on two subgroups of Black women - African Americans (AA) and Sub-Saharan African
immigrants (SAI) given that there is paucity of research with SAI despite known cancer related disparities among
SAI women. To promote screening for these underserved minority women, we will conduct research to better
understand factors that influence engagement in cancer screening practices and willingness to conduct HPV
self-sampling in which women self-collect samples for HPV testing using a swab, brush or lavage. Guided by the
findings, we will develop and pilot test an innovative tailored intervention incorporating HPV self-sampling with
peer-delivered education. The specific aims are to (1) examine general awareness and cultural factors related
to cancer control and prevention among AA and SAIs; (2) examine the socioecological barriers and facilitators to
CC screening with HPV self-sampling to tailor an evidenced based cervical health promotion program in these
underserved subgroups; and (3) assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The
intervention, entitled Health is Wealth: A Cervical Health Program, will be pilot tested with 30 AA and 30 SAI
women aged 30 to 65 years using a quasi-experimental design. These aims will also support the candidate’s
career goal of developing an independent and extramurally funded program of research to promote cancer
control and prevention for minority women. To further support this goal, a mentored career development plan
consisting of training in mixed methods, adaptation and development of behavioral interventions, randomized
clinical trial design, and research team management, is proposed. The rich research environment at the
University of Kentucky and the expertise of the mentoring team will provide the supplemental resources and
support needed for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed research and training plans. As such,
this K01 award will provide the training, mentoring, and research experiences needed for the candidate to
successfully compete for a R01-level CC screening intervention study and expedite her career development."

The problem of cancer in the 21st century remains a national priority, and as such, offers a
substantive long-term career opportunity for pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training. The
Translational Cancer Biology (TCB) T32 training program seeks support for 2 pre-doctoral and 4
post-doctoral trainees for 2 years each and emphasizes bench to bedside research
encompassing state-of-the-art areas of cancer research. Along with training in the fundamentals
of cancer research, trainees are provided with individualized access to many areas of basic and
clinical cancer research along with training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR),
including rigor in experimental design and data interpretation. Understanding how to work in
multidisciplinary teams and being familiar with “systems biology” and large data set analyses are
also a major goal of our training program. The TCB T32 program overarching goals are:
 1. To train top-quality scientists capable of conducting independent cancer research.
 2. To foster the intellectual, technical and communication skills required to succeed in the
 academic or industrial arenas of today and in the future.
 3. To provide an understanding of the basic, public health, and clinical problems of cancer.
 4. To provide a training program that includes cancer related didactic and journal-oriented
 courses as well as a program that includes biomedical ethics, RCR, enhanced
 reproducibility, biostatistics, bioinformatics and data mining, analyses and sharing.
 5. To provide training in grant writing, effective oral communications, and career planning.
 6. To maintain a program-specific recruitment program attracting a geographical broad range
 of applicants including underrepresented minority trainees.
 7. To have regular retreats to provide specific T32 opportunities for trainees to present their
 research and to develop the skills required to be effective scientists.
Our training grant eligible pre-doctoral and post-doctoral applicant pool has almost doubled during
the last 5 years. The ability of this training grant to bridge an existing outstanding foundation of
basic cancer research programs with our experimental therapeutics programs in the Harold
Simmons NCI Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, distinguishes it from a standardized
general graduate and post-graduate educational program. We have 35 committed, well funded
faculty mentors, with a dedicated group of steering committee members, along with Cancer
Center administrative intellectual and financial support."
10934071,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer in the US and remains incurable, with virtually
all patients developing relapsed or refractory disease after initial therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell
therapy (CAR T) is a revolutionary new treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
who have progressed on several prior treatments and have limited treatment options remaining. In clinical trials,
RRMM patients treated with CAR T showed unprecedented treatment response rates and improved patient-
reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom burden. CAR T is now
available to RRMM patients as standard of care, offering patients new hope for durable remission and better
HRQOL. However, clinical trials had stringent eligibility criteria and lacked racial and ethnic diversity, which limits
the generalizability of findings to RRMM patients treated in standard of care. To address this limitation, we will
establish a first-in-kind prospective cohort of real-world RRMM CAR T recipients at Moffitt Cancer Center, one
of the leading high-volume US institutions offering standard of care CAR T for diverse RRMM patients. Within
an evidence-based psychoneuroimmunology framework, we will evaluate psychosocial factors (i.e., depression,
anxiety, social support) and immune-related factors (i.e., systemic inflammation, bone marrow immune
microenvironment) as they relate to key clinical and patient-reported survivorship outcomes (i.e., incidence and
severity of CAR T toxicities, treatment response, progression-free survival, HRQOL, and symptom burden).
Immune-related factors may be especially relevant to this population’s survivorship, as CAR T harnesses a
patient’s own immune system to kill cancer cells, and recipients can experience potentially life-threatening
immune-mediated toxicities. Participants will complete PRO assessments and provide blood specimen samples
for quantification of immune biomarkers at clinically defined timepoints, from pre-CAR T infusion (i.e., baseline)
through one year. We will also use multiplex immunofluorescence staining and novel statistical methods
developed by our team to characterize the abundance and spatial relationships of immune cells in the bone
marrow microenvironment. This resource of highly phenotyped RRMM patients with systematically collected
PRO data and biospecimens will allow us to identify psychosocial factors (Aim 1) and immune-related factors
(Aim 2) associated with key clinical and patient-reported survivorship outcomes among real-world patients
treated with CAR T as part of standard of care. Study findings will have direct clinical implications. Identifying
psychosocial and immune-related factors associated with CAR T survivorship outcomes will inform the
development of patient education and clinical decision-making tools. Findings will also elucidate modifiable
targets for developing and implementing supportive care interventions and use of inflammation-reducing
medications. Long-term, this research will improve survivorship for RRMM patients treated with CAR T, a growing
yet understudied population living with incurable cancer."

The All of Us Research Program (AoURP), which started enrolling participants in 2017, is an 
ambitious, forward-looking and futuristic national endeavor to create and sustain a research data 
platform unique in the world, with the ultimate objective of advancing effective health care 
approaches and interventions that are exquisitely and precisely tailored to individual patients. 
Known as “Precision Medicine” or “Precision Health” in which preventive measures, diagnoses 
and treatments are designed specifically for an individual based on their genetics, exposures, 
biomarkers and personal preferences, the AoURP was envisioned as a mechanism for 
overcoming a number of significant research barriers in order to accelerate the achievement of 
this revolutionary goal. The AoURP is specifically designed to address current issues that plague 
precision medicine/health research efforts, including small sample sizes of cases and population 
sampling frames, inadequate population diversity, limited breadth of data, gaps in patient followup, incompatible data platforms, restricted data access, challenges in obtaining IRB approvals 
and cost. The research platform of core participants is already approaching that of the successful 
UK biobank, but is far more diverse in terms of population age, race, ethnicity and geography. 
Electronic health records of core participants are uploaded as well as genetics, physical 
measurement and survey data. Over 5400 researchers are already registered on the platform. 
Investigators from six integrated delivery networks spanning six states (MA, MI, MN, ND, TX, 
WI) of the Health Care Systems Research Network, Henry Ford Health and Corewell Health, 
Baylor Scott & White, Essentia Health, Univ Massachusetts/Reliant Medical Group, and 
HealthPartners, established the All of Us Trans-America Consortium for the HCSRN (TACH) to 
support the mission of the AoURP. Funded in 2016, TACH shares the undergirding philosophy 
of the NIH and AoURP and has demonstrated this through our work during the last 6+ years. We 
continue to have the scientists and staff, resources and experience to contribute to growing and 
sustaining the program and using the AoURP research platform., In this new award period, the 
TACH network proposes to expand geographically with respect to inclusion of those historically 
underserved in biomedical research by adding two new institutions St Louis University / SSM 
Health and Kaiser-Permanente Northwest, as well as eight more states (OH, IN, SD, NH MO, 
OK, OR, WA) without current HPO coverage, for the purpose of better serving the program’s 
objectives. 
Using organizational performance methods to ensure ethical practices, quality, and continuous 
improvement to meet the AoURP’s goals and milestones, our Specific Aims are: 1) a. Implement 
and geographically expand a dedicated AoURP-centered comprehensive patient and community 
outreach and engagement program and b. Recruit and enroll 12,000 new core participant partners 
per year, with a focus on individuals historically underrepresented in biomedical research to 
assure an expansive representation of genetic, environmental, social and disease variation in the 
AoURP core population; 2) Sustain and expand the established AoURP’s TACH health care 
provider consortium’s multi-site infrastructure to retain previously and newly enrolled 
participant partners to ensure that the rich population diversity in the AoURP amplifies and 
persists and, 3) Actively participate in AoURP committees, provide subject matter expertise, and 
promote scientific activity using the AoURP research platform within the TACH consortium and 
through active outreach by TACH investigators to their already established scientific networks 
through presentations about the program at national meetings."

The Participant Center (TPC) will 1) maintain capabilities that enable full All of Us Research 
Program (All of Us) participation across the United States (US) and 2) lead innovation in the 
participant experience in support of program goals. TPC is an alliance of more than 25 partners, 
led by Scripps Research.
TPC makes it possible for interested individuals anywhere in the U.S. to join and remain 
engaged in All of Us. TPC will reach individuals where they are through approaches ranging 
from light touch digital outreach to high touch, in-person one-on-one support. TPC strategies and 
tactics aim to support the recruitment of over 200,000 new baseline participants, while upholding 
the program’s goal to reflect the rich diversity of the US by including 50% participants who have 
been historically underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) based on their race and/or 
ethnicity, and 80% participants who are UBR based on any program-defined category. We aim to 
maintain at least 75% active retention, in line with TPC’s current active retention rate of 86%. 
Drawing on our experience in All of Us since 2016, including the recruitment of over 97,000 
participants and support of biospecimen collection from over 44,000 participants, we will 
improve on the processes and relationships we have built to further the program’s mission to 
enable individualized health care. 
TPC will utilize All of Us Participant Labs (APL) to implement participant-facing innovation that 
accelerate progress toward program goals. Employing streamlined processes and dedicated 
innovation infrastructure to carry out a portfolio of high risk/high reward initiatives, we will 
manage an innovation pipeline while minimizing program risk. Data-driven decisions will be 
made in each step of the process, from literature reviews informing idea development to impact 
evaluations that measure participant responses. Opportunity cost will be carefully considered, 
and projects will be abandoned if they are a suboptimal use of resources. Initiative ideas will be 
solicited from all consortium stakeholders and selected through a process that includes alignment 
with NIH goals and roadmaps and the APL focus areas of enrollment, engagement, retention, 
biospecimen collection, and research data collection. Beginning with APL initiatives, we aim to 
combine novel data collection with multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) to return personalized 
information and improve participant health."
10895568,"The proposed projects are a comprehensive effort to rigorously investigate the contribution of phenology -
or seasonal activity - to pathogen transmission dynamics using 3 widespread zoonotic pathogens carried 
by black-legged ticks. Variation in seasonal activity patterns and life-history events, which are well 
documented in species inhabiting temperate regions, can result in dramatic population dynamics including 
population extinctions or explosions. Phenological variation across time and geography also alters the 
frequency and strength of inter-species interactions and thus opportunities for pathogen transmission, 
which likely has profound impacts on pathogen transmission dynamics and human disease risk. Despite 
the likely importance to public health, the consequences of phenological variation on disease transmission 
dynamics remain notably under-studied in many complex zoonotic disease systems. The tick-borne 
disease system in North America provides the ideal system to determine the impact of phenology on 
pathogen transmission dynamics both theoretically and empirically. We will build and evaluate solvable 
analytical models, computational models, and advanced statistical models, all of which explicitly 
incorporate tick seasonal activity, and validate these models with empirical data from natural field sites. 
The proposed projects will (1) determine the quantitative impact of different phenological scenarios on the 
transmission dynamics of, and thus disease risk from, 3 human pathogens, (2) empirically evaluate model 
predictions, and (3) identify specific phenological and environmental features that result in different 
transmission dynamic outcomes among pathogen species. We will develop 3 modeling frameworks to 
investigate the impact of phenology on transmission dynamics, identify and quantify phenological and 
environmental drivers of transmission dynamics in 3 important human pathogens, and empirically validate 
the outcomes of the theoretical and statistical models. Empirical validation of both the phenological drivers 
and model predictions is essential not only for public health management but also to identify mechanistic 
processes driving these patterns. The proposed research provides both theoretical and empirical 
frameworks to investigate the impact of phenology on transmission dynamics in the multitude of disease 
systems involving multiple host species or life-stages from insect-vectored plant pathogens to pathogens 
with multi-host life-cycles."

10939258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that causes severe atrophy in the
hippocampal area. The dentate gyrus of the mammalian hippocampus harbors populations of quiescent neural
stem cells (NSCs) that can re-enter the cell cycle and differentiate into functional excitatory neurons. This
process of neurogenesis supports learning and memory functions, as well as healthy mood regulation.
However, in aging and AD, levels of neurogenesis sharply decline, and work in rodents has demonstrated a
functional link between levels of neurogenesis and cognitive performance. Although quiescent NSCs are the
source of new neurons, the current understanding of how these cells are impacted in AD is extremely limited.
Preliminary work shows that quiescent NSCs are defective in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, these cells are
particularly vulnerable to damage during aging, which is the greatest risk factor for AD. This proposal takes an
integrated, multiomics approach to address the critical question of how the quiescent pool is affected in AD.
Using a well-established mouse model and human tissue, specific Aim 1 will define the transcriptomic and
epigenomic changes at the single cell level in AD. Work in Aim 2 will employ metabolomics to fully elucidate
the metabolic changes that occur in AD. Lastly, Aim 3 will use a functional transcriptomics screen targeting
central pathways in quiescent NSCs to identify how these cells are selectively vulnerable in AD. Together this
work will result in a comprehensive understanding of how dormant NSCs are affected in a mouse model of AD
as well as in human tissue. This study will provide key data to the neurodegeneration community that can be
leveraged for functional studies and the development of interventions to prevent, treat and even cure
neurodegeneration in the long term."

The Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program at Washington University has been affiliated with the BMT CTN
since its inception, initially as a part of the Case Western Consortium, and as a Core Clinical Center since 2011.
During that time, our institution has made significant contributions to the BMT CTN through clinical trials accrual
and trial design input. The specific purpose of applying for this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to
continue participation as a BMT CTN Core Clinical Center.
The long term goal of the proposed clinical trial is to apply novel concepts in immunology and cellular therapies
to improve outcomes and further expand clinical application of adoptive transgenic chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T-cell therapies. While the use of CAR T-cells have emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the
treatment of many malignant diseases, and has shown a remarkable promise in a variety of non-malignant
disorders, cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) remains a major cause of morbidity and a significant barrier to a
successful outcome. CRS is a hyper-immune reaction driven by excessive inflammatory cytokine activation and
proliferation, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) thought to be one of the most functionally important cytokines during CRS.
Although there are agents used for the treatment of established CRS, including IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab, there
are no FDA-approved agents for CRS prophylaxis. Duvelisib is an oral, dual PI3K-δ,γ inhibitor that is FDA-
approved for the treatment of adults with several hematologic malignancies, with acceptable safety profile. Using
a protein kinase inhibitor library researchers have identified PI3K-δ,γ inhibitors, including duvelisib, as most
potent inhibitors of IL-6 secretion, without attenuating CAR T-cell function. We and others have performed
extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments investigating the effect of duvelisib on CRS cytokines, leading to a
phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study of duvelisib for CRS prophylaxis in patients with non-Hodgkin
lymphomas undergoing CAR T-cell treatments, open for enrollment at Washington University. Preliminary results
from that study show that duvelisib is safe and tolerable, and delays the onset and reduces the severity of CRS.
Based on these data, we propose a phase III, multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled study with the primary
objective to assess the efficacy of duvelisib in preventing grade ≥2 CRS in patients with large B-cell lymphoma
and mantle cell lymphoma undergoing therapies with axicabtagene ciloleucel, lisocabtagene maraleucel or
brexucabtagene autoleucel (Aim 1). The expected outcome of this trial is to provide definitive data on the
effectiveness of duvelisib for CRS prophylaxis within the study population, without negatively affecting the
efficacy of CAR T-cells. In addition, variety of correlative studies will provide further insight into the biologic
impact of PI3K inhibition, paving the way to further research (Aim 2). We hypothesize that PI3K inhibition with
duvelisib will provide effective prophylaxis against clinically significant (grade ≥2) CRS."

The cellular environment is crowded with a concentration of macromolecules between
200-400 grams per liter. This crowding affects protein interactions, binding affinities, and
diffusion. These conditions are not replicated in the dilute solutions used for in vitro
studies. To have a full understanding of protein function, it is necessary to study
proteins in complex environments that mimic the in vivo environment. However, the high
concentration of macromolecules makes it difficult to perform structural studies in these
systems. Owing to this, it is necessary to develop new methods to study protein
structure in complex model systems. Here, we propose to further establish the protein
footprinting method fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) for studying
complex model systems. FPOP utilizes hydroxyl radicals to oxidatively modify solvent
accessible amino acids in proteins. The in vitro method can identify protein-ligand and
protein-protein interaction sites as well as regions of protein conformation changes. My
group has further expanded FPOP for studies in cells (IC-FPOP) and in vivo (IV-FPOP)
in C. elegans, an animal model for human disease. We have demonstrated that IC- and
IV-FPOP can oxidatively modify hundreds to thousands of proteins in these complex
systems. The next step in method development is to establish their efficacy for
identifying protein interactions in these model systems by studying specific applications.
For the next 5 years, we plan to apply IC- and IV-FPOP to study protein folding and
aggregation. The identification of protein interactions involved in misfolding and
aggregation will help design new therapeutics. We also plan to extend the method into
another three-dimensional model system, ex vivo tissue. This will provide structural
information in a model system that more closely resembles the in vivo environment than
monolayer cell culture."

Recently, as part of the enhancing Genotype Tissue-Expression (eGTEx) project, methylome data on subsets
of GTEx samples (N=987) from nine tissue types of 424 subjects have been generated by co-I Pierce’s lab to
complement existing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data. As part of eGTEx, our group conducted the
standard methylation QTL (mQTL) mapping for each of the nine tissues and multi-tissue mQTL analysis using
existing methods. The challenges in our mQTL analyses motivates the development of the methods in our first
aim. In Aim 1, we propose to develop methods for integrative QTL mapping, integrating multi-tissue mQTL
with multi-tissue eQTL statistics to improve the detection of QTLs with co-occurring effects in related tissues
and/or omics data types. In addition, we propose to extend the method to map multi-cell-type single-cell eQTLs
by integrating bulk-tissue QTL statistics, and to map trans-ethnic QTLs with supervised learning using GWAS
summary statistics as reference. In Aim 2, we propose to develop multivariable Mendelian randomization
(MR) methods for mapping risk genes accounting for confounding from DNA methylation. We illustrate
that existing MR methods proposed for complex trait exposures insufficiently address challenges in studying
gene expression as exposure, due to violations of instrumental variable assumptions. We propose to develop
MR methods for modeling multi-tissue expression levels as exposure adjusting for multi-tissue methylation,
leveraging multi-tissue eQTL and mQTL statistics to improve effect consistency of instrumental variables. In Aim
3, we will analyze GTEx and sc-eQTLGen data for cis- and trans-QTL analyses, will apply the proposed MR
methods to map risk genes for complex diseases and traits with a focus on cardiovascular diseases and
Alzheimer’s disease, and will conduct replication and validation analysis. We will develop efficient and scalable
software. Our application highlights the importance of jointly examining multi-omics traits from multiple cellular
contexts in studying genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying susceptibility to complex traits and diseases."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the etiologic agent of infectious mononucleosis, is the major trigger
for multiple sclerosis and is associated with a range of lymphoproliferative disorders and
carcinomas. EBV is spread between hosts through the oral cavity, where it crosses epithelial
barriers to infect naïve B cells in tonsil lymphoepithelial tissue. Primary EBV infection and much
of the EBV lifecycle is centered in the oropharynx, which are persistently colonized. Yet, much
remains to be learned about virus/host interactions that govern the oral cavity EBV lifecycle.
According to the EBV germinal center model, EBV uses latency programs to navigate the B-cell
compartment, initially driving B-cell activation and growth via the pre-latency, latency IIb and
latency III programs. Incompletely understood cues in tonsil and related lymphoid tissues are
thought to switch the EBV program to latency IIa in germinal centers. Subsequent differentiation
into memory B-cells, the reservoir for lifelong EBV infection, give rise to the latency I program,
comprised of a single EBV latency gene, EBNA1. However, this has remained difficult to model
and limited information is available about EBV/host interactions in the tonsil microenvironment.
This lifecycle is highly associated with EBV-driven malignancies, with a heavy disease burden in
craniofacial regions, including Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However,
much remains to be learned about how EBV rewires host cell one-carbon (1C) metabolism to
support key aspects of the viral lifecycle in tonsillar versus peripheral blood B-cells. We
therefore used metabolomic, proteomic and CRISPR genetic approaches to identify a central
role for interconnecting methionine and folate 1C metabolism pathways in support of EBV-
driven B-cell transformation and the viral lifecycle. Our central hypothesis is that EBV latency
programs subvert multiple levels of interconnecting methionine and folate metabolism cycles to
perform non-redundant functions critical for the viral B-cell lifecycle in tonsil versus peripheral
blood compartments. Using novel primary human B-cells and tonsil tissue models, our Specific
Aims are therefore to: 1) Identify key mechanisms by which EBV drives newly infected tonsil
and peripheral blood B-cell methionine dependency; (2) Identify key mechanisms by which
methionine metabolism drives newly infected tonsil and peripheral blood Epstein-Barr nuclear
antigen expression and signaling; (3) Characterize key EBV latency gene-induced methionine
and folate metabolism roles in tonsil peripheral blood B-cell redox defense. Our studies will
provide novel insights into crosstalk between immunometabolism, viral latency gene programs

The goal of this Oncology Co-Clinical Imaging Research Program (CIRP) proposal is to overcome the
translational barrier, as stated in PAR-18-184, to develop co-clinical imaging research resources that will
encourage a consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging
results for co-clinical trials. This will be accomplished by using novel quantitative metabolic preclinical
hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess therapeutic response of small cell
neuroendocrine (SCNC) prostate cancer (PCa). The murine imaging study will be conducted in parallel to a
clinical trial (NCI R01 CA215694), aiming to assess response of SCNC to carboplatin in men with metastatic
PCa, led by Drs. John Kurhanewicz and Rahul Aggarwal at UCSF. SCNC is an increasingly prevalent, lethal
subtype of PCa that arises as an adaptive response to the application of androgen deprivation therapy and
second-generation potent androgen pathway inhibitors. The selection of the most appropriate treatment of
patients with metastatic SCNC is hindered by the fact that neither blood tests or current imaging modalities can
reliably identify therapeutic efficacy in these metastatic tumors which are also often not amenable to biopsy. The
study design of this U24 project incorporates the four key elements of CIRP: 1) The preclinical development and
optimization of quantitative HP 13C MRI acquisition and data analysis methods that address the lack in rigor and
reproducibility of existing preclinical and clinical approaches (aim 1); 2) The use of appropriate patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models that reflect the genetic, metabolic and micro-environmental heterogeneity of SCNC
metastases in patients; 3) The application of the optimized preclinical dynamic HP 13C MRI protocols and data
modeling approaches to study the response of metastatic bone and liver disease in the PDX models to
chemotherapy, paralleling the funded study in patients (aim 2); and 4) The establishment of an online resource
of quantitative HP 13C MRI imaging protocols, data analyses, modeling tools, correlative biology data for wider
dissemination, validation and establishment of consensus by the scientific community (aim 3).
To accomplish this important translational quantitative imaging project, we have assembled an exceptional team
of basic science and clinical investigators with complimentary expertise in preclinical and clinical cancer
research, realistic PDX models, HP 13C MRI, informatics, and in leading imaging and therapeutic clinical trials.
This research project will also capitalize on the extensive resources provided by the NIH funded P41
Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Technology Resource Center, the large number of preclinical and clinical
DNP polarizers and 13C-enabled MRI scanners, and imaging informatics infrastructure which exist at UCSF.
Although this proposal will focus on current standard of care treatment, the new quantitative HP 13C metabolic
MRI approaches developed in this proposal will have general applicability for a variety of new targeted
therapeutic approaches being developed for SCNC as well as for the study of other diseases."
10908514,"A major challenge of treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is the simultaneously occurring complex
secondary injury processes following the primary injury. The secondary events such as cerebral
hyperglycolysis and mitochondrial failure develop over minutes to months after the primary injury, providing a
potential window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Given early, this intervention may prevent or
reduce secondary brain damage, directly impacting long-term patient outcome. Therefore, the noninvasive
detection and characterization of pathophysiology in TBI patients during the acute and early sub-acute stages,
will have critical clinical implications for the early diagnosis of individuals with the highest risk of poor
neurological outcomes and will be vital for identifying and developing effective therapies. While a number of
pathological alternations in TBI are potential biomarkers, no current clinical imaging modalities are sensitive
enough to be routinely used to detect the details of metabolic shifts in brain sub-regions with secondary injury.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled substrates provides unique
noninvasive measurements of critical in vivo dynamic metabolic processes. In particular, pyruvate occupies a
key nodal point in cerebral energy metabolism, among the fates of [1-13C]pyruvate are reduction to lactate as
the end product of glycolysis, conversion in mitochondria to form acetyl-CoA and CO2 (detected as HCO3–) via
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) flux or anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase (PC) pathway for oxidative
phosphorylation. [2-13C]pyruvate, on the other hand, directly assess the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by
detecting [5-13C]glutamate production. While our preliminary data demonstrated increased lactate and
decreased HCO3– (bicarbonate) production from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate in a rat TBI model and acute
TBI patients, however, the role of [13C]HCO3– as a TCA cycle marker needs further verification due to the high
pyruvate carboxylation. Another key metabolic alteration following TBI is increased acetate oxidation in
astrocytes, playing a neuro-protective role. The increased acetate metabolism tightly interacts with pyruvate
metabolism, and thus, should be considered together when interpreting [13C]pyruvate metabolism.
The fundamental goal of this project is to understand how TBI influences the in vivo cellular metabolism in the
brain using hyperpolarized 13C MRSI as a step towards personalizing therapy for TBI patients. In this proposal,
a comprehensive analysis of TBI metabolism will be performed using a rat TBI model by comparing the in vivo
imaging results with ex vivo tissue analysis. First, we will develop hyperpolarized [2-13C]pyruvate as a probe to
directly measure the altered TCA cycle activity in TBI (aim 1). Second, we will assess the contribution of
increased acetate metabolism to pyruvate oxidation in a rat TBI model (aim 2). The longitudinal in vivo imaging
data (aims 1&2) will be validated by cross-sectional ex vivo NMR isotopomer analysis of freeze-clamped brain
tissues. Finally, we will translate the technique to assess metabolic changes in acute mild TBI patients (aim 3)."
10908610,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The current application aims to address racial/ethnic disparities in health experienced by African
American young adults through the isolation of acute cognitive and affective mechanisms in the
linkages between racial stigma, stress, and vulnerability to substance use. The extant literature
provides critical observations of the link between self-reported racial discrimination and real-
world risk behavior among African Americans. However, cognitive-neuroscience paradigms
have been underutilized thus limiting our understanding of core cognitive and affective
processes that underlie stress reactivity, recovery, and behavior in the immediate context of a
racial stigma event—as well as factors that may amplify or mitigate acute effects. To address
this need, we build on the cue reactivity and substance use literature to develop a racial-stigma,
cue-focused task to drive event-related designs for assessing stigma-related change in brain
systems involved in cue reactivity, executive function, and reward processing. This work has the
potential to shed new light on (a) cognitive and affective processing of singular events of racial
stigma (Aim 1) (b) how racial-stigma stress produces sustained changes in affective and
regulatory processes (Aim 2) and (c) risk and resilience-promoting factors that moderate these
processes (Aim 3). In the proposed K08 career development plan, the Candidate will undertake
training to acquire core skills in cognitive-neuroscience approaches, based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related potential (ERP) measures, to assess underlying
mechanisms of the stigma-stress-substance use pathway. These include conventional time-
domain approaches (e.g. late positive potential; LPP), joint time-frequency EEG/ERP analysis of
regional neural activation in amplitude (e.g. medial-frontal theta and centro-parietal delta), and
how neurophysiological activity is coordinated into dynamic functional networks using time-
frequency phase-synchrony approaches. Further, the Candidate will learn to utilize these
approaches to index constructs that are consistent with emerging measurement domain
frameworks, namely Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), which offer a heuristic for representing
complex neurobiological systems. The RDoC constructs of focus are of key relevance to
substance use and include negative valence and positive valence systems (affective) as well as
cognitive control (regulatory). The utilization of cognitive-neuroscience measures and mapping
to RDoC constructs will allow for the parsing of core cognitive and affective processes, enhance
theoretical clarity and predictive utility of racial-adversity stress in the context of risk behavior,
and ultimately provide more parsimonious intervention targets."

The electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner mitochondrial membrane is essential for efficient ATP production
in the cell. ETC function can be disrupted both genetically and pharmacologically by mitochondrial diseases and
metabolic poisons, respectively. Inefficient ATP production affects all tissues, but particularly the brain with its
high energy demands, thus making this a deadly neurological problem. ETC dysfunction is often associated with
buildup of the initial electron donor, NADH, within the mitochondria. This increase in NADH corresponds with a
decrease in its oxidized form, NAD+, contributing to an overall NAD+/NADH ratio imbalance. Since NAD+ and
NADH are cofactors for many redox reactions in the cell, this results in redox imbalance and reduced metabolic
flux, intensifying the energy production problem.
Cyanide, a pharmacological ETC inhibitor, and Leigh syndrome, a collection of fatal genetic mitochondrial
diseases, both result in inefficient ATP production, NAD+/NADH ratio imbalances, and severe neurological
consequences. Few cyanide antidotes exist, all of which have a limited efficacious time window for
administration. No cure is available for any form of Leigh syndrome. We hypothesize that normalization of the
NAD+/NADH ratio will improve outcomes for both cyanide poisoning and Leigh syndrome. Within Aim 1 of this
proposal, we will investigate 1) if restoring NAD+/NADH ratio is sufficient for rescuing cyanide poisoning and 2)
what occurs downstream of restoring NAD+/NADH ratio in the context of cyanide poisoning. Within Aim 2, we
will determine if redox modulators can rescue disease phenotypes in an array of zebrafish models of Leigh
syndrome designed to cover a wide breadth of mutations associated with Leigh syndrome. These disease
phenotypes include glial reactivity and deficits in locomotion, oxygen consumption, and associative learning.
Collectively, these experiments will evaluate the therapeutic value of restoring the NAD+/NADH ratio for different
forms of mitochondrial dysfunction, and will focus on redox modulators that improve neurological outcomes."
10908711,"Project Summary
Lung diseases such as acute lung injuries (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are leading
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are traditionally thought of as critical
negative regulators of systemic immune responses; however, their local roles in tissues such as the lung are
being increasingly appreciated, where they can promote lung epithelial regeneration in both ALI and ARDS.
Subsets of tissue-resident Tregs (tTregs) are found to express transcription factors T-bet, Gata3, RORt, and
Bcl6, and have enhanced suppression towards their Th1, Th2, Th3/17, and Tfh immune ‘flavors,’ respectively.
Although tTreg function are beginning to be understood, how lung tTregs are regulated, positioned, and
maintained within their respective tissue niches remains unknown. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are
immune regulators and have been highlighted to play a role in tTreg biology. Production of IL-33 by a subset of
MSCs promotes the expansion and maintenance of visceral adipose tissue tTregs and human MSCs can induce
Tregs from conventional CD4+ T cells in vitro. Our group identified a stromal cell niche within the lung where
adventitial fibroblasts (AFs), an MSC subset, regulate type 2 effector lymphocytes (e.g. ILC2s and Th2 cells), in
part via the secretion of IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Using 3D thick section imaging, I have
shown that lung type 2-like tTregs (i.e. Gata3hi ST2+, KLRG1+) also localize to this niche, indicating AFs may
regulate lung tTregs and their subsets. When co-cultured with lung AFs, lymphoid Tregs significantly increased
proliferation, survival, and expression of type 2-like Treg markers ST2 and KLRG1 in a contact-dependent
manner. Additionally, AFs preferentially support ST2hi Tregs, as evidenced by higher proliferation, survivability,
and ST2 and KLRG1 expression. Using CellphoneDB V2.0, I identified extracellular matrix (ECM)–integrin
ligand–receptor pairings, such as ICAM, VCAM, and CD49d, that may mediate interactions between AFs and
Tregs. Upon blocking all three in a co-culture system, I found a significant decrease in Treg proliferation and ST2
and KLRG1 expression. I hypothesize that AFs regulate the maintenance and differentiation of lung Treg subsets,
preferentially supporting type 2-like lung Tregs, which play critical roles in post-injury lung repair. This proposal
will define the topography of type 2 lung tTregs and their role in naïve and inflammatory settings (Aim 1) and
determine the role of adventitial fibroblasts in the regulation of lung Treg subsets (Aim 2). This work utilizes
murine models of inflammation, as well as genetic ablations to dissect the local type 2 tTreg response in the lung.
High-dimensional flow cytometry, advanced imaging, and lung function measurements will be used to quantify
impacts on immune cells and functional lung recovery. Completion of these aims will elucidate the role of AFs in
the function and regulation of lung type 2 tTregs, providing novel mechanistic insight into the role MSCs play in
regulating immune subsets. Completion of this study provides a foundation for the development of precision
therapeutics to selectively regulate lung tissue Tregs subsets to impact the outcome of diverse lung diseases."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography significantly reduces lung cancer mortality, the
leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Despite its life-saving potential, lung cancer screening
uptake remains extremely low among eligible populations (about 5%). Lung cancer screening utilization is even
lower among populations that experience a disproportionate burden of lung cancer (e.g., Black and low-income
Americans). In November 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) called for more evidence
to increase equity in lung cancer screening uptake in their Annual Report to Congress. Yet, multilevel barriers
to lung cancer screening exist at the patient, provider, and health system levels. However, prior research
assessing these barriers is limited by inadequate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity among
participants and exclusion of key health care staff (e.g., nurses) who often champion screening programs.
Medical mistrust is another commonly reported screening barrier. Yet, mistrust is often studied as a patient-
level barrier, ignoring that mistrust arises from structures, such as racism in health care. Many health care
interventions also lack trustworthiness, partly because they are often designed without community input. Little
is known about how screening barriers can be addressed through implementation strategies that center equity
and have an explicit goal to earn patient trust. Through three specific aims, this study will address these
knowledge gaps. These aims are to: 1) identify multilevel barriers and facilitators to the equitable
implementation of lung cancer screening (K99 phase), 2) engage with community advisors and key
stakeholders to identify multilevel implementation strategies to promote equity in lung cancer screening (K99
phase), and 3) pilot test the feasibility of multilevel implementation strategies designed to equitably improve
lung cancer screening uptake (one at the patient level and one at the provider/system level, R00 phase). To
complete these research aims, the candidate (Dr. Jennifer Richmond) requires didactic and mentored training
in lung cancer leadership, implementation science, and methods for designing/evaluating multilevel health
equity interventions. Dr. Richmond has assembled an outstanding mentoring team (Drs. Melinda Aldrich,
Consuelo Wilkins, Eric Grogan, and Carolyn Audet) with collective expertise in these areas to help her achieve
the research and training goals. Overall, this innovative study will be among the first to respond to the USPSTF
call for evidence to increase lung cancer screening equity. It will also lay the groundwork for a R01 application
to evaluate the intervention pilot tested in this study. With support from her mentors and the exceptional
training and research environment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Dr. Richmond will reach her long-
term goal of transitioning to independence and becoming a national leader in lung cancer equity research."

Abstract
Children with substantial African ancestry have long been known to have half or less the rate of B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) than do children with other continental ancestries. This is true both in
international comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL
in African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse
association of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for
the disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively
causal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by
genomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting
undiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing
DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life
of the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci
and new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture
in association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally
evaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-
standing mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared
to EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at
presentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome
among AA children."

Project Summary
Black/African American (Black) young adults have among the highest cigarillo smoking prevalence in the U.S.
Cigarillos contain more tobacco and higher levels of carcinogens per gram than cigarettes, with inhalation
levels as high as or exceeding that of cigarette smoking. Cigarillo smoking causes multiple cancers and
pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Outcome expectancies (e.g., utility values and anticipated emotions)
are associated with Black young adults’ cigarillo smoking. Additionally, some Black young adults misperceive
cigarillos to be less harmful and addictive than cigarettes, which is associated with their cigarillo use. Cigarillos
are under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s regulatory authority. The FDA is positioned to inform this
vulnerable population about the health harm and addiction potential of cigarillos. Public education messaging is
one effective strategy to provide accurate health information and increase harm perceptions, prevent and
reduce tobacco use, and reduce tobacco-related health disparities. However, there has not been health
communication studies examining effective cigarillo public education messaging for Black young adults, and
how to optimize such messaging. This K99/R00 career award will help fill these gaps in identifying effective
health communication strategies to communicate cigarillos’ harms to Black young adults ages 18 to 30 years.
The specific aims of this proposed study are to: 1) develop and pilot test candidate cigarillo harm messaging
among Black young adults at-risk for established cigarillo use; and 2) test the efficacy of cigarillo harm
messaging on harm perceptions and use intentions, and explore its effects on use behaviors among Black
young adults at-risk for established cigarillo use. With my mentors, I will develop and test the effects of public
education messaging about cigarillos’ health harm and addiction potential alone as well as contextualized to
address Black young adults’ outcome expectancies. I will pilot test candidate messages with Black young
adults at-risk for established cigarillo use to examine their visual attention and self-report rating of perceived
message effectiveness. Through an online randomized controlled trial, Black young adults at-risk for
established cigarillo use will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 message conditions: 1) harm; 2) harm
contextualized with outcome expectancies; or 3) control messages to test intervention message effects on
cigarillo harm perceptions, use intentions, and use behaviors. Participants will view two condition messages
daily online for four weeks and complete self-report measures of cigarillo harm perceptions, use intentions and
use behaviors at baseline, 1- and 3-month follow up. This K99/R00 career award will position me as a tobacco
researcher focused on health communication for racial/ethnic minority young adults. It will provide the FDA with
a sound scientific base on effective cigarillo public education messaging for Black young adults. These findings
will also inform designing effective public education messages for other cigar and tobacco products."

Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy diagnosed in adolescents and young adults (AYAs), with
nearly 13,000 new cases diagnosed among women younger than 40 in the United States each year. Because
AYAs are generally treated aggressively and are diagnosed at a time in their lives when having BC is non-
normative, treatment can be extraordinarily disruptive and AYA survivors are more likely to suffer medically and
psychosocially after a BC diagnosis than older women. While many acute symptoms resolve following initial
treatment, the long-term physical, emotional and psychosocial impact on a young woman’s life trajectory may
worsen or only become evident in survivorship. Our team and others have documented the unmet needs of AYA
BC survivors in symptom management (e.g., sexual problems, anxiety, fatigue, stress, depression, sleep
problems, hot flashes, musculoskeletal complaints), as well as AYA concerns, defined as concerns unique to or
accentuated by being young at diagnosis (e.g., fertility/family planning, genetics, finding life partners,
childrearing, body image and sexuality, and educational and economic attainment). Beyond causing distress,
AYA BC concerns and symptoms influence longer-term treatment decisions, including adherence to risk-
reducing adjuvant endocrine therapy and health behaviors. Thus, improved attention to AYA BC concerns and
symptoms in survivorship may improve not only symptom management and quality of life (QOL), but disease
and overall mortality outcomes. However, the health care system is not equipped to meet the needs of AYA
patients who are struggling with subacute symptoms and concerns following the completion of active treatment.
Strategies to empower patients with the tools and support they need to fully recover and to improve well-being
are needed. Serial symptom monitoring using electronic patient-reported outcomes systems has resulted in
greater attention to and better management of symptoms, and improved QOL and survival in adults receiving
chemotherapy. We have adapted this model and designed, piloted, and refined the Young, Empowered and
Strong (YES) portal, a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for AYA BC survivors. YES is a multicomponent
intervention to engage and activate AYA BC survivors to self-monitor and self-manage AYA concerns and
symptoms, outside of the clinical setting, by providing tailored information, resources and support. For additional
psychosocial support, YES provides an expressive writing platform as well as a monitored “chat room” for young
survivors to connect with each other. In the proposed research, we will test the YES portal compared to usual
care in a 3 site randomized clinical trial of 360 geographically and racial-ethnically diverse young BC survivors
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Ohio State University, and Columbia Univeristy Medical Center. We
expect this novel mHealth intervention will reduce overall symptom burden and unmet AYA concerns and
improve quality of life, and will be utilized and valued by a diverse population of AYA BC survivors."
10938849,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Phase transitions are emerging as a fundamental organizational principle for gene regulation.
Transcription is organized into diverse higher-order structures called transcriptional condensates:
Pol II associates into dynamic foci that rapidly assemble and disassemble concomitant with
mRNA production, while the nucleolus maintains a tri-partite layered structure that supports the
steady stream of rRNA. However, little is known how and why the flow of gene expression is
organized across disparate condensates in the mitochondria. For example, within the
mitochondrial matrix, the mitochondrial (mt-) genome and its RNA products are not diffuse but are
packaged by proteins into distinct droplet-like structures called mt-nucleoids or mtRNA granules,
respectively. Within the framework of biomolecular phase transitions, the vision of the research
program will be to investigate how biomolecules involved in mitochondrial gene regulation self-
organize into higher-order, functional structures in the mt-matrix and how anomalies to these
biophysical processes contribute to mitochondrial (dys)function. The goals for the next five years
are to identify the biomolecular interactions underlying the immiscibility of mt-condensates using
in vivo and in vitro systems and supported by theoretical modeling. Using super-resolution light
microscopy, we will perform biophysical experiments on the organization and dynamics of the
components within mt-condensates. We will complement these microscopy experiments with
next-generation sequencing approaches to identify the biomolecular networks underlying the
biophysical behavior. Next, using our established in vitro mt-transcriptional system, we will study
the interplay between phase coexistence and resulting transcriptional activity. We will support
these experiments by performing analogous perturbations in live cells within the phase transition
framework, allowing us to directly connect phase behavior to the flow of gene expression. Finally,
this proposal will elucidate how the structure-function relationships of mt-condensates contribute
to mitochondrial (dys)function in live cells. Overall, this research program will apply ideas from
thermodynamics and polymer physics to uncover the biophysical principles underlying the flow of
gene expression across these disparate condensates within the mt-matrix. This work will shed
light on the functional consequences of the canonical organization of mt-condensates and how
anomalies contribute to dysfunction, with implications for disease processes. By harnessing
mitochondrial biology, we will uncover structure-function relationships of transcriptional
condensates, which will pave the way for developing entirely new strategies to precisely target
these structures in the pursuit of improving human health."
10938094,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 All genetic information is stored in DNA that is intricately wrapped by proteins to form chromosomes.
Telomeres are the nucleoprotein complexes that cap and protect the ends of chromosomes to prevent them from
fraying, fusing together, and degrading. In addition to capping and protecting the ends of chromosomes,
telomeres regulate the recruitment of telomerase, a specialized enzyme that synthesizes telomere DNA to
collaborate with replicative polymerases and ensure complete chromosome replication. Over the past several
years, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the genes of telomere end-binding
proteins in patients diagnosed with a range of disorders, including many different types of cancer. These
observations indicate that subtle changes in the structure and/or function of telomere proteins contributes to
genome instability. POT1 (Protection of Telomeres 1) is the most mutated telomere protein associated with
human disorders. POT1 forms a heterodimeric complex with another telomere end-binding protein, TPP1, to
perform diverse but equally critical functions. Specifically, POT1-TPP1 binds to the extreme 3’ end of telomeres
and helps to resolve DNA secondary structure, to recruit telomerase to the telomere, and regulate telomerase-
mediated telomere synthesis. In addition, the POT1-TPP1 proteins shield telomere DNA from being recognized
and repaired by DNA damage machinery. Finally, the POT1-TPP1 heterodimer exhibits extraordinary sequence
specificity that provides discrimination against binding to RNA or to DNA with non-telomere sequence. The
objective of the present proposal is to investigate the multiple and diverse roles of POT1-TPP1 in telomere
maintenance. We will further interrogate the intricate details of telomerase-mediated extension of telomere DNA
and identify how changes in nucleotide pools affect telomerase function and fidelity. Additionally, we will examine
the role of FDA-approved and developing nucleotide and nucleoside analogs in telomerase rates and fidelity. To
accomplish these objectives, we combine structure-function studies to determine the molecular interactions that
dictate POT1-TPP1 function and we corroborate the mechanistic studies with cellular outcome. The results from
this investigation will reveal both structural and functional alterations introduced by pathogenic mutations and
drug administration and will be used to better understand the diverse functions of specialized telomere proteins
and telomerase in maintaining telomere integrity and genomic stability. The project includes a translational
component as we will define the understudied contributions that chemotherapeutic and antiviral agents have on
telomere integrity. On a fundamental level, the work performed in this study will shed light on the assembly,
organization, and functional motions that regulate chromosome end protection."
10938095,"This investigation aimed to identify the mechanisms and molecular functions of ribosome stalling in Huntington
disease (HD). HD is caused by the polyglutamine (CAG) expansion of huntingtin (mHTT), which promotes
neurodegeneration in the brain, causing motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Multiple abnormal functions
have been proposed for mHTT, but its pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Using super-resolution ribosome
profiling (aka Ribo-Seq) and biochemical tools, we demonstrate that mHTT promotes ribosome stalling and
inhibits protein synthesis, which is the topic of the current investigation. The central hypothesis is that mHTT
interacts with RNA and ribosomal binding proteins (RBPs) to inhibit ribosomal movement and increase
HD pathogenesis. Our published and preliminary data indicate that mHTT copurifies with 40S ribosomal
subunits, directly binds to elongating ribosomes, and suppresses protein synthesis both in vitro and in vivo.
Interestingly, Ribo-Seq revealed that mHTT mRNA exon1 also had substantial ribosome occupancy before CAG
expanded repeats, which we validated using biochemical reporter experiments. We found that the RBP fragile
x-mental retardation protein (Fmrp), a negative regulator of synaptic mRNA translation, is upregulated in HD and
that Fmrp deletion inhibits age-dependent motor deficits in a humanized HD model. On the basis of these solid
data, the proposed research has three interrelated objectives: 1) to identify the ribosome-bound protein/RNA
component that interacts with mHTT; 2) to determine the mechanisms of ribosome stalling on mHTT mRNA; and
2) to delineate the role of Fmrp in modulating protein synthesis at the synaptic level in HD. Consequently, the
outcomes will likely reveal novel hypothesis-generating ribosome stalling mechanisms in HD, identify critical cis
and trans components implicated in mHTT RNA stalling, and determine how the mHTT-Fmrp nexus regulates
aberrant synaptic translation in HD. These findings will help develop translation mechanism-based treatment
and diagnostic modalities for poorly understood neurological illnesses."
10938177,"Project summary: The evolutionary and genomic drivers of mutation spectra.
 Patterns of spontaneous mutation vary widely, but there is currently no consensus as to how selection and
drift shape this variation. Our goal is to explain diverse mutation patterns, connecting evolutionary causes and
consequences with molecular mechanisms. Mutation rates are predicted to be higher in cases where selection
had less opportunity to act over evolutionary time, but there is no consensus as to whether this hypothesis is
supported by existing evidence. We will test this idea using a novel framework that leverages variation within
and among yeast species. Yeast can grow asexually as either haploids or diploids, but species differ in which
cell type predominates. We predict that mutation rates will be higher in cells of the rare type in any given
species, because selection has had little opportunity to act on mutator alleles specific to that cell type. We will
test for ploidy-specific mutation patterns in multiple yeast species that have either haploid- or diploid-dominant
life cycles, and test candidate molecular mechanisms for these differences. This project is expected to confirm
a controversial hypothesis for the evolution of mutation rates while avoiding previous limitations.
 Sex is a major dimension of biological variation that can affect mutation patterns, both with regards to
differences between males and females as well as the presence or absence of recombination. There is
evidence that spontaneous mutations are more likely to arise in the germline of males than females, but the
reasons for this bias are still debated. Many existing measures of sex biased mutation come with important
limitations, and many organisms also have a sex bias in recombination, potentially confounding the
interpretation of sex differences. To disentangle the influence of sex versus recombination we will use a fruit fly
strain that lacks meiotic DNA double strand breaks to manipulate the presence of recombination. We will also
use crossing techniques to maintain chromosomes with male- or female-exclusive transmission. Allowing
mutations to accumulate in these strains and then sequencing their genomes we will provide a unique and
powerful perspective on the respective roles of parental sex and recombination in the mutation process. We
will further explore the interaction between sex and mutation by measuring how mutations affect reproductive
traits. In fruit flies, we will explore the impact of aneuploidy on males and females to understand levels of
observed karyotype variation under mutation-selection balance. Yeast are largely asexual, but there is
evidence that sexual selection can operate in this system. We will characterize genetic variation for mating-
type specific reproductive performance, using genomic data to identify causal alleles. By converting mutant
strains between mating types and ploidy states we will be able to infer genetic trade-offs between sexual and
asexual performance, informing models for the evolution of sex and anisogamy. These projects will deepen our
understanding of how sex and recombination co-evolve with the mutation process."

Transmembrane transporters play a critical gatekeeper role in determining and controlling the intracellular
concentration of ions, nutrients, toxins, or drugs in all cells. Our current knowledge of transmembrane
transporters is mainly gained by extensive studies on proton, alkali, and alkaline earth metal cation transporters,
while the transport of anions and transition metals is overlooked despite their significantly different properties.
The (dys)function of anions and transition metal transporters is now linked directly to resistance against
antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and metal-based drugs and is associated with many human diseases such
as cystic fibrosis, myotonia, Menkes, and Wilson’s diseases. Despite their biological importance, the underlying
biochemical and biophysical basis at the atomic and molecular level for the selectivity, transport mechanism,
stoichiometry, and conformational dynamics of anion and transition metal transporters remain largely elusive.
The long-term research goal of my laboratory is to fill this gap in the field of transmembrane transporters by
combining different advanced computational approaches.
To this end, this MIRA application aims to investigate two phylogenetically unrelated families of bacterial fluoride
export protein: CLCF F-/H+ antiporters and fluoride ion channels, and P1B-type ATPases which transport Cu+,
Cu2+, and Zn2+ across cellular membranes. My laboratory has established a computational platform by integrating
different advanced computational approaches to study various complex biological systems including
transmembrane proteins. In the proposed research, we will combine quantum, molecular, and statistical
mechanics, and advanced polarizable force field development and will integrate our advanced computational
techniques with experimental and co-evolutionary investigation to 1) monitor the dynamics and local
conformational changes of the transmembrane transporters, 2) characterize the selectivity filter and coordination
chemistry of the transported ions, 3) identify contributing residues in ion transport, 4) introduce mutations that
potentially alter the ion selectivity, 5) find promising inhibitors, 6) determine transport stoichiometry and counter-
transport ions, and 7) map out the transport mechanism. Built upon our experience, we will focus on the inclusion
of explicit polarization in modeling transmembrane transporters because ions in particular anions and transition
metals have high polarizability. We will provide a comprehensive comparison between the models developed
with polarizable and non-polarizable force fields. The developed polarizable force field for lipid molecules will
have a novel feature to make it transferable to other studies of biological systems.
The proposed project will target a neglected aspect in studying transmembrane transporters, will establish an
innovative computational framework to study these complex systems, and will train a new generation of
biomedical scientists. The outcomes of the proposed project will address the emerging global challenge of
antibiotic and metal-based drug resistance and aid bioengineers in designing novel effective therapeutic agents."
10940341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The barrier tissues and body cavities are densely innervated by nociceptor sensory neurons (or nociceptors) that
respond to noxious stimuli and mediate pain. Nociceptive innervation in the lung and peritoneal cavity begins as
early as the embryonic development stage. Similarly, long-lived tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs), such as
alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) in the peritoneal cavity, start to
populate at the very early stage of life and co-localize close to nerve fibers. However, it is unknown whether
neurons can regulate TRM development and impact TRM abilities to respond to injury and inflammation. Upon
activation, nociceptor nerve terminals secrete neuropeptides that act on their cognate receptors in macrophages
for immunomodulation. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is dominantly secreted in our body by
nociceptor sensory neurons. TRMs are well known to exhibit polarization (M1 or M2) depending upon the specific
signals they encountered during their development or inflammatory conditions. While M1 macrophages are pro-
inflammatory and damage the tissue during infection/injury, M2 macrophages exhibit tissue-protective type 2
inflammation and are crucial for resolving tissue damage and barrier dysfunction. Our preliminary data
demonstrated that the nociceptors suppress the abundance of AMs and PMs at steady state, and lack of
nociceptor signals polarize AMs and PMs to M1 type during activation with TLR ligands. By investigating AMs
and PMs in ex vivo system and in vivo injury model, this R35 MIRA research program will determine the role of
nociceptors and their subsets in the development and function of TRMs during steady-state and inflammation.
Understanding neuron-TRM crosstalk is critical for determining the mechanism underlying loss of homeostasis,
tissue damage, and pathogenesis of complex inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis. Specifically, this research
program will address the following three key questions: 1) Do nociceptor neurons play a role in maintenance of
TRMs at steady-state? 2) Do nociceptor signals involve in regulating the TRM polarization? 3) What is the role
of neuropeptide receptor in TRM maintenance and M1/M2 polarization? Using both ‘loss and gain of function’
neuronal manipulating strategies in mice and using the neuropeptide deficient and neuropeptide receptor
deficient mice, we will study the AMs and PMs to address these questions. Targeting the nervous system directly,
or through downstream receptor signaling pathways in TRMs, will inform about the host-based strategy as a
treatment modality for tissue damage and inflammatory diseases."
10940345,"Project summary. People with blindness and low vision (BLV) experience systemic exclusion from
biomedical science because the tools of experimental science—and the data they produce—are
inaccessible. The two central hypotheses of this proposal are: (i) the tools and information of an
experimental biomolecular research lab can be made accessible to people with BLV with interventions
that incorporate universal design, and (ii) persons with BLV can use these tools to test biomedical
hypotheses and publish their results in peer-reviewed journals. This project has four aims; two aims for
developing assistive technology, and two aims to use this technology to test hypotheses about (i)
heteromeric interactions between wild-type (WT) Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and mutant
forms of SOD1 that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and (ii) redox properties of mitochondrial
redox enzymes. In aim 1, we plan to methodically make each tool/technique in the PI’s lab accessible,
beginning with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, protein purification, capillary electrophoresis, PCR, and
touch screen devices (pH meters, centrifuges). Assistive technology is being designed and 3D printed
in the PI’s lab, including a device that enables researchers with total blindness to autonomously load
SDS-PAGE gels by hand. Robotic devices that weigh solids and initiate biochemical reactions are also
being made accessible. In aim 2, graphical imagery and data (electropherograms, spectra, electron
micrographs) are converted into lithophanes (engravings that provide tactile readouts and optical
readouts via light scattering). Haptic gloves—developed for gaming—will be adapted to help researchers
with blindness visualize virtual objects (protein structures, CAD files, etc.). In aim 3, these tools will be
used by blind and sighted researchers to test how incorporation of WT SOD1 into fibrillar mutant SOD1
affects its kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural properties. Here, fluorescence spectroscopy, amide
H/D exchange, chemical crosslinking and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to test the hypothesis
that WT SOD1 incorporates into mutant fibrils to alter their structure/morphology, stability and
propagation rate. In aim 4, “protein charge ladders,” capillary electrophoresis, and site directed
mutagenesis will be used to test the hypothesis that long-range electrostatic interactions in mitochondrial
metalloproteins play a dominant role in controlling their redox properties. Each aim is developed for (and
in collaboration with) faculty and researchers who have early blindness and persons with late blindness,
who developed blindness as adults after Ph.D. training in biomedical science (these latter persons have
been forced to drop out of science). This project involves a collaborative team of sighted and blind
biochemists, chemists, electron microscopists, and computer scientists, including undergraduate, post-
doctoral, and independent scientists with blindness currently in the PI’s lab."

This proposal aims to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical impact and feasibility
of a virtual reality (VR) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program vs. sham VR among patients with irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS causes chronic, recurrent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits and
affects >10% of the US population. It significantly impacts biopsychosocial functioning, and people with IBS
experience health-related quality of life decrements similar to those with diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and
congestive heart failure. While there are many available pharmacologic treatments, most often fall short in
delivering meaningful improvements in IBS symptoms and are commonly limited by side effects. Conversely, as
IBS is a disorder of gut-brain interaction, CBT has been shown to be very effective and safe in IBS and is
endorsed in national guidelines. There is, however, a paucity of CBT-trained clinicians in the US, which markedly
limits patients’ access to this efficacious, well-tolerated therapy. To begin to address this gap, our team
developed a self-administered, home-based VR program—called IBS/VR—that delivers CBT over an 8-week
period to help patients manage their IBS symptoms. In Phase I (Design) of the ORBIT Model for Developing
Behavioral Treatments for Chronic Diseases framework, we developed and refined the program with a
multidisciplinary team (CBT psychologist, gastroenterologist with IBS expertise, psychiatrist, biomedical
visualization specialist, VR programmer, human-centered design expert, and digital health researchers) in
partnership with patients. The 8-week CBT program guides patients through the following essential components:
(i) psychoeducation; (ii) relaxation strategies; (iii) cognitive restructuring; (iv) problem-solving skills; (v) exposure
techniques. In initial qualitative validation testing with 15 patients, they expressed positive perceptions about
using VR for CBT, and all participants said they would recommend IBS/VR to others with IBS. We are now in
Phase II (Preliminary Testing) of the ORBIT Model and propose to test the clinical impact and feasibility of our
VR CBT program vs. sham VR among patients with IBS. In this pilot RCT, we will achieve the following aims:
Aim 1—Acquire preliminary data assessing the clinical impact of an 8-week VR CBT program (IBS/VR) on IBS
symptoms vs. sham VR control; Aim 2—Establish the feasibility of using an 8-week VR CBT program (IBS/VR)
among patients with IBS. If this pilot study demonstrates that the VR CBT program is both feasible and shows
preliminary evidence that it meaningfully improves IBS symptoms at 8 weeks, it will provide a strong platform to
undertake an adequately powered, hypothesis-testing Phase II efficacy trial in a future R01. Moreover, this study
will provide critical information allowing us to further optimize both the VR CBT program and implementation
efforts in clinical workflows prior to the definitive efficacy trial. Given the high prevalence of IBS combined with
the paucity of effective medical therapies and marked shortage of trained CBT practitioners, the development
and validation of novel self-administered, behavioral approaches—such as VR CBT—are sorely needed."

This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at
Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will
support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and
bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and
cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher.
The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to
affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast
cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information
in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage
breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a
distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in
this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving
hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the
biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches
to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are
associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard
therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative
subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach
in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are
defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3;
integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize
that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine
therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast
growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate
for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for
metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the
K08 Award."
10911270,"Project Summary
Although the integration of neurobiology into immunological research has just begun, it has already profoundly
improved our understanding of immunology. By using the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, we have
identified three specific neuro-immune regulatory circuits that are mediated by the G protein-coupled receptors
OCTR-1, NPR-8, and NMUR-1, respectively. Our studies and others indicate that there could be a
predetermined setpoint for internal immunity, like the setpoint for the human heart rate, and that the nervous
system regulates immune responses to internal or external environmental changes and restores immune
homeostasis by bringing immunity back to the setpoint. Considering this “setpoint for immune homeostasis”
theory, we plan to investigate how the nervous system and immune system interact to achieve the resolution of
infection and the specificity of innate immunity, two important but poorly understood issues in immunology.
Previously, we have characterized the OCTR-1-dependent neuro-immune regulatory circuit in great detail and
have revealed that NMUR-1 mediates the specificity of C. elegans innate immunity. Here, we propose studies
to dissect the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying neural regulation of resolution in the context of
the OCTR-1 circuit and to identify specific neurons, neural networks, and neural signals that regulate NMUR-1-
mediated specificity of innate immunity. These studies will advance our understanding of how the nervous
system controls both infection resolution and innate immune specificity as well as define key regulatory
principles that govern neuro-immune relationships. Results from these studies could benefit the development
of new treatments for infectious diseases and innate immune disorders."

There has been an obesity crisis in the U.S. for the last 30 years. African American women have the highest
rates of obesity in the U.S. compared to every other race/ethnicity and gender cohort. New and innovative
strategies to address obesity among this group must be used to reverse this trend, especially for young African
American women who have grown up in a technology driven society, unlike their older counterparts.
Information regarding health and healthy practices are much more available to this group of women. In
addition, the use of social media has become a daily task for Generation Z women, so it is vital that healthcare
professionals understand how social media use impacts the health behaviors of Generation Z African
American women, especially as it pertains to obesity, which can lead to chronic illnesses, such as heart
disease and type 2 diabetes. The proposed study seeks to 1) understand the impact imagery-based social
media use has on the diet and exercise habits of Generation Z African American Women. Using a mixed
methods research design to collect qualitative data and design a quantitative psychometric measure; 2)
determine the eating and fitness habits of Generation Z Black women using a convergent mixed methods
research design to triangulate students’ qualitative responses and quantitative responses on existing health
behavior measures to ensure that the quantitative measures effectively measure the health behaviors of the
sample population; 3) determine the impact that Instagram “fitspiration”, “thinspiration”, and body
positivity/#healthatanysize messages have on current and planned eating and fitness activities using a
correlational study (to determine the relationship between variables) and an experimental study (to determine
causality between the independent variable and dependent variable) and 4) engage African American
psychology undergraduates and graduates in extensive mixed methods research training that will include
qualitative and quantitative data collection, coding, analysis, and interpretation, psychometric measure design,
as well as research findings dissemination. Considering the power of social media’s influence, it is likely an
avenue to increasing positive health habits to prolong the lives of Black women. Understanding how social
media impacts the health and fitness habits of younger generations of African American women can lead to
preventions that lower the incidence of obesity in these women."

 To move successfully, we must be able to sense our bodies and our environment. This is no more evident
than when participants attempt to strike a match to light a candle after their hand’s somatosensation has been
numbed. Despite being able to see well, participants fumble with the match and clumsily attempt to accomplish
the task. Further, somatosensory-motor integration is notably impaired in many types of neurological movement
disorders including Parkinson’s disease, stroke, essential tremor, and dystonia. Developing rehabilitation or
therapeutic strategies to improve somatosensory-motor integration faces a central challenge: while the
theoretical importance of somatosensory-motor integration (SMI) is clear, how the brain actually processes
afferent signals to enable excellent movement control remains unclear.
 In this proposal, we seek to use a population neural dynamics framework to understand how the brain
implements SMI computations. Specifically, we will leverage a novel feedback-dependent dexterous
manipulation task, high-density multi-area recordings, and an innovative type of electrical stimulation that can
be used to modulate inter-area communication in the macaque monkey. These combined experiments and
analysis are designed to uncover how SMI computations, long known to be critical for movement control, are
implemented in population neural activity patterns in brain. Further, they will pave the way for developing
approaches for restoring damaged SMI in the brain after brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.
 The main experimental approach of this proposal includes simultaneous high-density, high channel-count
(Neuropixel) electrophysiological recordings from the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex
(S1), and cerebellar-receiving motor thalamus (mThal) in non-human primates that are learning and executing a
dexterous manipulation task. The main analytical approach includes modeling the timeseries of motor cortical
population activity as a combination of intrinsic motor cortical dynamics and inputs from S1 and mThal. The
hypothesis of this proposal is that S1 and mThal exert different influences on M1 population dynamics throughout
the learning and execution process. Specifically, we hypothesize that S1 provides specific sensory updates that
drive M1 population activity, and mThal modulates the temporal dynamics of M1 population activity. We will
further develop evidence for or against this hypothesis by leveraging a novel neuromodulation approach that can
boost or interrupt communication between distant brain regions. Completion of this proposal will constitute an
understanding of how SMI computations, that have long been thought to be essential for movement, are actually
implemented in the circuitry and population dynamics of the macaque sensorimotor system. This advance would
improve our understanding of how to target somatosensory nodes to improve control of movement following
motor impairment."

American Indian (AI) populations face significant health inequities, yet there is an underrepresentation of AI
individuals in the scientific and research workforce. Research indicates the low number of AI students that
progress through the educational and career pathway is due, in part, to a lack of culturally competent educational
services, support systems, and mentors. Due to these inequities and lack of resources and mentoring, there is a
critical need to foster sustained partnerships between Tribal Nations and institutions conducting intensive
academic-level health research to recruit AI students and support their pathway to health research careers.
Cherokee Nation has partnered with the University of Oklahoma (OU) and Oklahoma State University (OSU) to
develop the Cherokee Nation Research Immersion Student Experiences (RISE) program in order to foster
interest and expertise specifically in biomedical, clinical, and behavioral health research. Cherokee Nation RISE
aims to train the next generation of AI scientists to achieve health equity. Cherokee Nation has as longstanding
partnership in research with OU. Cherokee Nation has partnered with OSU to establish the nation’s first tribally-
affiliated college of medicine in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, which is the location of the tribe’s headquarters. Cherokee
Nation RISE will reach across multiple levels of trainees from high school through graduate school as well as
medical students and residents to expose AI trainees to health research at each level of the scientific pathway.
The project aims are to 1) Support AI students and trainees along the scientific pathway with health research
exposure, hands-on research experiences and formal mentorship; 2) Increase the pool of biomedical
researchers who are formally trained in mentoring and dedicated to mentoring and engaging AI students in their
ongoing research programs; 3) Develop and maintain an online community for Cherokee Nation RISE students,
mentors, and program alumni for networking, sustainment of engaged research and mentoring, and evaluation
and tracking. Through the NARCH partnership, Cherokee Nation is well-positioned to develop a cadre of AI
students and trainees engaged in biomedical, clinical, and behavioral health research; increase the pool of
faculty who are formally trained in mentoring AI students; and build an online community to evaluate, improve,
and sustain the program. Through expanded partnerships and the creation of a Cherokee Nation RISE Advisory
Board, we aim to lay the foundation for a large-scale inter-institutional training program across all levels of
students and trainees in order to facilitate the pathway to health research careers focused on improving AI health."

Following the immediate effect of acute COVID-19 on patients and healthcare systems, it has now also
become apparent that as many as 35% of COVID patients experience long-term health consequences of their
infection. These consequences are reported to include heart-related problems, digestive issues, fatigue and
dizziness, as well as anxiety and depression, but the full spectrum of symptoms and their duration is still
unknown. American Indian people have been disproportionately affected by the COVID pandemic due to
underlying medical conditions combined with high COVID-19 incidence and mortality, and general health
inequalities. As a result, the impact of long-term symptoms is also expected to be severe in this population. In
this study, we propose to examine the extent of long-term symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection among
American Indian people residing in the Cherokee Nation Reservation. Given the strong impact of COVID-19
and the lack of understanding of its long-term effect in the Cherokee Nation, there is a crucial need for
improved management among these patients in the community. This study will be among the first to assess
long-term symptoms in an American Indian population and as such will establish a precedent and framework
for future studies in the American Indian population. The overall goal of the study is to identify and quantify
long-term COVID symptoms among American Indian people and to develop guidelines for how to predict,
assess and manage these symptoms. This is an ambidirectional cohort study following a total of 200 persons
retrospectively (tested for infection within the past six months) and prospectively (tested for infection from the
time the study is initiated, and onwards). Using this approach, we will achieve our aims of identifying long-term
symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive versus negative American Indian persons, predicting who is at risk of
developing these symptoms and ultimately produce guidelines for predicting and identifying who is most at risk
of becoming affected by COVID symptoms in the long run and how manage the symptoms either in centralized
dedicated healthcare clinics or through primary care providers."

Rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus), rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
scleroderma and osteoarthritis, cause significant morbidity and early mortality in Native American populations.
Through ongoing collaborative work between the Cherokee Nation and the Oklahoma Medical Research
Foundation, we have found that classic autoantibody associations in rheumatic disease patients of other races
are not diagnostic in NA populations, identified novel autoantibodies in tribal rheumatic disease patents and
found that tribal patients and controls have unique cytokine signatures; all of which make rheumatic disease
care in tribal members more challenging to diagnose in primary care clinics. Surprisingly, we found that Native
American individuals without evidence of autoimmune rheumatic disease had the highest rate of autoantibody
production (10.5%) of all races, primarily with lupus, systemic sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis associated
antibodies. Autoantibody production is associated with lower levels of 25(OH)D in these individuals. Anti-
cardiolipin autoantibodies are also more frequent in NA rheumatic disease patients and controls.
Some of the highest rates of infection, poor outcomes and deaths from COVID have occurred in tribal
communities, and COVID induces autoantibodies in many otherwise healthy individuals, including anti-
cardiolipin responses that associate with thrombosis and anti-cytokine responses that associate with poor
disease outcomes. In studies from our group and others, many COVID patients with autoimmunity or
autoimmune disease are having prolonged symptoms, which are reminiscent of rheumatic diseases, such as
fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, malaise, rashes, lung and heart involvement. Select environmental factors have
strong associations with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. This project will define the impact of
environmental influences, such as viral infections (SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus), viral
reactivation (Epstein-Barr virus), vitamin D deficiency and smoking exposure, on the development of
autoantibodies and autoimmune disease in tribal members. Using single cell mass cytometry time of flight
(CyTOF) and single cell genomic sequencing partnered with antibody binding (CITE-seq), shared immune
pathways contributing to loss of self-tolerance, autoantibody production and autoimmune rheumatic disease
will be determined. Finally, through implementation of a telerheumatology, telementoring program focused on
practice-centric, case-based learning, academic detailing, and patient enrollment to clinical research protocols
rheumatology capacity within the Cherokee Nation Health System will be developed for current and future
patients. The overall goals of this project are to identify and confirm environmental influences associated with
autoantibody production, immune dysregulation and autoimmune rheumatic disease, as well as build lasting
tribal-based infrastructure to provide ongoing rheumatic disease evaluation and treatment that aid earlier
detection, decreased morbidity and improved outcomes in tribal patients."

Carcinogens and evolutionary pressures generate unique patterns in the types of somatic mutations observed
in the DNA of cancer cells. Mutational signature analysis investigates these patterns. Following promising initial
successes, the scope and variety of questions scientists ask in mutational signature analysis far exceed the
availability of robust data analytic tools to address them.
The overarching goal of this project is to develop, test, and apply a class of statistical models able to compre-
hensively support rigorous statistical inference on most of the important scienti?c questions arising in this novel
?eld. Speci?cally, we will generalize current approaches in fundamental ways to incorporate previously proposed
signatures, and account for multiple studies/conditions, covariates, paired/longitudinal data and batch effects.
We will develop a comprehensive free and open-source R package, conforming to Bioconductor standards, al-
lowing users to implement our analyses and their visualizations. Methods will leverage the investigative groups'
extensive experience in Bayesian modeling, multi-study modeling, multivariate analysis, and statistical genomics.
Development will proceed hand in hand with discovery efforts within the Dana Farber multiple myeloma genomics
program of which the PI is integral part.
Given the fast growth in whole exome and whole genome sequencing of tumors, and the corresponding growth
in the use of mutational signature analysis, we expect our tools to have a substantial impact, by enabling cancer
researchers to a) carry out more accurate analysis and b) more reliably evaluate the accuracy of their results.
Thus we expect this work to substantially accelerate the rate of discovery and clinical translation of the biology of
mutational signatures in cancer."
10910543,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 The mechanisms by which stem cells orchestrate their program to become functional differentiated
cells require accurate temporal regulation of specific gene expression programs. This complex network
requires precise temporal regulation of transcription and degradation processes to activate specific programs
in a coordinated manner. So far, most of the studies have explored the regulation of transcriptional pathways
and chromatin remodeling events during the differentiation process.
 mRNA degradation processes may present an attractive and still poorly explored opportunity for
enhancing our understanding of the differentiation process. However, the lack of technologies that can capture
rapid mRNA degradation events over highly dynamic processes, such as differentiation, and the heterogeneity
of the mRNA degradation machinery in composition and expression patterns during differentiation have
presented major technical limitations to further exploring the role of mRNA degradation across the continuum
of the differentiation program. Here I propose to explore the existence of specialized RNA degradation
complexes that control the decay of specific mRNA subclasses at precise timeframes of the differentiation
process.
 To test this, we will introduce a new platform that uses cutting-edge technologies integrated in
an innovative way to interrogate the continuum of the differentiation process at an unprecedented resolution.
Our programmable depletion and rescue strategy will allow us to control the expression level of each subunit of
complex mRNA degradation machinery robustly and with a precise time resolution of hours. By combining this
technology with a high-content imaging system, we can record phenotype changes and accurately determine
the specific impact of any perturbed protein on differentiation. Additionally, the use of this platform will guide us
to understand the exact gene regulatory network controlled by the machinery at the transcriptional and stability
level. The conceptualization and development of this workflow have the potential to impact a broader scientific
audience; due to its extremely high flexibility, it could be applied to the study of unlimited biological processes
or proteins.
 In this essay, the application of our proposed platform has the potential to fundamentally
overturn the current view of how mRNA decay is dynamically regulated, providing a definite
understanding of the function of the degradation machinery on mRNAs and, at the same time, revealing the
broader impact of the degradation process on differentiation."
10935240,"Building on our previous work, we are proposing an innovative dual-mode breast cancer scanner combining
positron emission tomography (PET) and x-ray tomosynthesis (XT).
Patient-specific evaluation of breast cancer therapy has become a compelling application of quantitative
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. With the advent of neoadjuvant therapies, it has been shown
repeatedly over the last decade by at least 11 studies that molecular imaging with clinical PET scanners can
be used to gauge response of breast tumors to therapies within days. In this approach, a window of opportunity
between diagnosis and surgery allows early evaluation of the effectiveness of the planned adjuvant therapy
before breast cancer resection. After a baseline PET image followed by a subclinical dose of the planned
therapy, a second PET scan can be used to evaluate treatment response. If there is no response then there is
time to test second-line and other alternative therapies and to guide the selection of an effective post-surgical
adjuvant therapy.
Dedicated breast-imaging PET scanners have been proposed and evaluated since the late 1980s. Despite the
sustained level of interest, clinical breast PET imaging with whole-body (WB) PET scanners has had little
adoption, a reflection of the challenges of using breast PET imaging in the diagnostic setting.
Our approach instead is to focus on the quantitative assessment of response to breast cancer therapy, a
unique advantage of PET imaging. However, this advantage is lost when imaging small objects (< 2 cm) in
whole-body (WB) PET scanners due to limited resolution. This has created a mismatch between current
technological capability and clinical need: WB-PET is accurate down to roughly 2 cm, but lesions <2 cm in size
are the most prevalent at breast cancer diagnosis. Thus a quantitative breast imaging high-resolution PET/XT
scanner will enable patient-specific optimization of therapy in early-stage breast cancer. Our three aims are: (1)
Development and construction of the PET/XT scanner. (2) Develop and implement the necessary quantitative
data correction algorithms for the PET/XT rectangular geometry, and integrate them with accelerated image
reconstruction. (3) Perform initial imaging studies with 10 breast cancer patients immediately after their
scheduled clinical WB PET/CT imaging. Comparisons of the PET/XT and PET/CT images will be used to
design a follow-up clinical trial.
The PET/XT system will be useable immediately in local clinical trials evaluating new breast cancer therapies.
Initial patient studies will also provide essential data for designing follow-up clinical trials evaluating translation
to clinical practice."

This proposal establishes a rigorous and supportive interdisciplinary training program in clinical pain research at Mass
General Brigham (MGB) in Boston. The program will support a diverse pool of postdoctoral fellows, who will enroll in
the program for 2-3 years, with the goal of expanding and enhancing the pool of early career stage investigators who are
able to launch and maintain successful careers addressing the nation’s scientific needs in clinical pain research. The
program provides protected research time and dedicated training in the context of a unique cohort approach, allowing not
only a network of formal mentors, but also peer-mentoring integrated into a rich training experience. In addition to
learning through practical engagement in the research process, trainees will undertake coursework tailored to their
individual experience, needs, and goals, which can include the completion of graduate certificates or degrees at Harvard
University. Required training in responsible conduct of research and research rigor will further establish a solid
foundation in clinical research. A national pool of candidates will be recruited, with dedicated and systematic efforts to
establish and maintain diversity through recruitment and retention of individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic
groups, disabled individuals, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The 12 diverse mentors in the program
(including the 2 PIs) have been selected on the basis of their excellence in clinical pain research and strong mentorship
track records. They vary in career stage, background, and expertise, coming from fields beyond those traditionally
represented in pain research (e.g., psychology, neurology, neuroscience, psychiatry, epidemiology). These mentors are
well-positioned to provide training for eight prioritized pain research content areas: (1) Advancing health equity in pain,
(2) Understanding and treating chronic overlapping pain conditions, (3) Implementing effective interventions for pain and
co-morbidities, (4) Characterizing the impacts of social determinants of health on pain, (5) Optimizing non-opioid
pharmacological treatments for pain, (6) Designing and delivering nonpharmacological interventions for pain, (7) Treating
pain across the lifespan, and (8) Preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain. Following participation in the
program, trainees will be well-positioned to establish a career of independently-funded clinical pain research and enrich
the next generation of research leaders and mentors in pain. The program’s long-term goal is to enhance the number
clinical pain researchers with interdisciplinary training and collaborative outlook, in order to promote innovative non-
opioid solutions for pain management and improve patient care by providing high-quality training to future leaders in
clinical pain research."

In this application, we are applying for renewal of our consortium between Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
TX and Children’s National Hospital in Washington DC as a Core Clinical Center in the BMT CTN Network. Our
consortium performs over 350 transplants per year (over 150 pediatric and over 200 adult procedures) and also
infuses over 150 immune effector cell products (Investigational and commercial products) per year. We also
have strong programs in non-malignant disorders performing over 300 allogeneic transplants for non-malignant
hematologic, metabolic and immunologic disorders in the last 5 years. Furthermore, our centers have extensive
experience developing, implementing and completing complex biological therapies with cell and gene therapy
products and have successfully sponsored and implemented over 140 cell and gene therapy studies under more
than 70 investigator initiated INDs, including multiple Phase II multicenter studies. We have also been strong
contributors to BMT CTN with 161 patients enrolled in the last funding period. Importantly we have been highly
successful in matching CTN clinical trial accrual to the diverse populations of our two catchment areas including
27.8% Hispanic, 19.6% African American and 3.5% Asian subjects. Although both centers have strengths in cell
therapies we selected a research proposal based on the laboratory work of Dr. Pavan Reddy a physician scientist
who directs the NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center at Baylor College of Medicine because we
hypothesize that this is a highly feasible strategy with strong potential to appreciably impact the incidence of graft
versus host disease (GVHD) which remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients post
hematopoietic cell transplant. (HCT) In preclinical studies, Dr Reddy discovered that butyrate was significantly
decreased in intestinal epithelial cells of mice experiencing GVHD, and that increasing intestinal butyrate-
producing bacteria reduced the severity of experimental acute gastrointestinal GVHD. Administration of resistant
potato starch (RPS), as a prebiotic, promoted an increase in butyrogenic bacteria and intestinal levels of butyrate.
In a pilot study testing this intervention in the clinic, administration of RPS to allogeneic transplant recipients was
feasible and was associated with significant alterations in intestinal and plasma metabolites. A phase II trial
examining the effect of RPS on GVHD in allo-HCT recipients is underway and, in this application, we propose a
randomized Phase III trial to evaluate the effects of modulating the microbiome to reduce GVHD in a larger
multicenter cohort. We assert that this approach requires multicenter testing to confirm whether the microbiome
modulation is reproducible in diverse populations in different geographic locations and to determine if there is a
significant reduction in the incidence of GVHD."

This project, focused on biomedical big data analysis in cancer research, represents a response to the ongoing
need for initiatives that enhance the capabilities of researchers in the field. As the volume and complexity of
cancer-related data continue to grow, equipping researchers with data analysis skills and conceptual
understanding is paramount. The 12-day workshop component of the renewal proposal aims to provide
participants with the essential knowledge and practical skills necessary for proficiently handling and interpreting
large-scale datasets, especially different types of omics data in cancer research. By fostering competence and
confidence in data analysis, the workshop will contribute to a more informed and skilled research community,
thereby enhancing the utility and value of the NCI-funded data. Through its rigorous curriculum and hands-on
training, our proposal aligns with current data analysis challenges while providing flexibility and adaptability over
the performance period. The proposal is a follow-up to two previous rounds of funding and underscores our
ongoing commitment to advancing cancer research through robust data analysis techniques. The continued
demand for big data training is supported by the results from the survey of our workshops and the substantial
number of applications to the workshop each year.
This proposal includes an updated course that leverages the successes and insights gained from the current big
data courses for cancer researchers and the previous courses on big data training for biomedical researchers
supported by NIH/BD2K, ensuring the topics are adapted to the constantly evolving nature of big data in cancer
research. Our multidisciplinary team includes expertise in basic cancer research, clinical oncology,
bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computer science by harnessing the collective expertise from the Chao Family
Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), University of Colorado Cancer Center,
and the Anvil supercomputer (number 143 on the Top500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers).
University of California, Irvine is in a unique position to lead a big data education program through partnerships
with the current American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) epidemiology workshop team, the Frederick
National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), the Cancer Informatics for Cancer Centers (Ci4CC), and the
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium (Big Ten CRC). By targeting cancer researchers who appreciate the value
of big data but lack the analytical skills necessary, this renewal proposal will incorporate new topics in current
cancer research and establish a cohesive big data community for sustainable communications of workshop
participants. The overarching goal of the proposed renewal project is to empower the participants with skills
and confidence to efficiently manage, visualize, analyze, integrate big data, and derive meaningful insights from
the analyses, which can help them meet the critical need of the growing availability of precision oncology-based
treatments."

To enable reliable access to meaningful quantities of bioactive natural and unnatural compounds with
higher complexity, it is vital to devise new synthesis logics and develop new chemical transformations.
In this context, we propose to investigate the highly coveted is the rapid assembly of polycyclic
frameworks adorned with several chiral centers. Our explorations focus on the synthesis and study of
complex natural products and their fully synthetic analogues with potentials for the treatment of cancer,
neurological disorders, and infectious diseases. The terpenes and alkaloids we identiﬁed as targets are
promising lead compounds for the development of new medicines, but their unknown or unclear
mechanism of actions and the lack of a dependable way to access them has severely hindered their
therapeutical development. We aim to solve this issue while also expanding and innovating the toolbox
available to medicinal and synthetic chemists. In fact, these molecules are not only important from a
biological standpoint, but they also represent state-of-the-art challenges for complex molecule
synthesis. Thus, these total synthesis efforts stimulate the invention of new chemicals methods and
serve as a proving ground for our new logics and existing transformations to solve critical synthesis
problems in complex settings. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a) the development
of new catalytic stereoselective methods that generate densely substituted polycyclic building blocks
for synthesis, b) the design of new synthesis logics that will facilitate the preparation of complex
functional molecules for which there are currently no efﬁcient synthesis roadmaps, c) reliable access to
the chosen target molecules enabling their use as biological probes or as lead compounds for drug
discovery, d) a collection of medicinally relevant synthetic analogues for in-depth biological evaluations."

The Black or African American population continues to face barriers in workforce representation in
the fields of Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences despite multiple initiatives to enhance
workforce diversity in biomedicine. Factors contributing to the workforce disparities among Black
professionals are complex and multifaceted: Black children face limited access to quality education
and opportunities in the STEM fields at grassroot level, which become major barriers later on in life
for those aspiring to pursue careers in Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences; socioeconomic
disparities among the Black population usually impact access to educational resources and pre-professional training needed to pursue research-related careers in these fields; and the low
representation of Black professionals in Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences create lack of
awareness among Black students about potential research-related career paths in these fields. Thus,
there is a critical need to increase Black representation in research careers by developing a training
curriculum that provides research experiences and career mentorship. Our proposed Program –
Black or African-American research training Pathway to Otolaryngology and Communication
Sciences (BAA-POCS) – will address career disparities and pave the way for reductions in health
inequalities and improvements in healthcare outcomes. This collaborative program will engage two
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina – Bennett College and Saint
Augustine’s University – with Duke University’s Department of Head and Neck Surgery &
Communication Sciences (HNSCS) such that undergraduate students from these HBCUs will
undergo rigorous research training over a 15-month period under the mentorship of Duke faculty
members. To achieve our objective, the following specific aims are proposed: [1] Conduct a rigorous
clinical and research training curriculum for preparing undergraduate students for research careers
in Otolaryngology and the Communication Sciences; [2] Provide professional development activities
to promote professional identity and preparation for graduate or medical school; and [3] Create
support groups for students and program alums to engage one another regarding career decisions.
The culmination of this BAA-POCS program will provide students from these HBCUs with a
comprehensive research training and mentorship experience, which will generate enthusiasm and
self-efficacy, and increase the number of students interested in pursuing careers in Otolaryngology
and/or the Communication Sciences."

10896282,"Substance use, e.g. of opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine, and alcohol, has skyrocketed in the US, and
has been declared a public health crisis. Substance use disorder (SUD) leads to a significant impairment
in physical, mental, social, and occupational functioning, coupled with an inability to reduce or control use
and the development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Like any other addiction, the precursor to
substance use episodes are cravings moments, and hence, they will be opportune moments to intervene
if it is possible to detect them. We have the potential to characterize patients’ conditions by combining multimodal sensor measurement in the laboratory like fMRI and clinical assessment, and field measurement via wearable and ubiquitous sensing. However, there are still many challenges to be solved to leverage these multimodal data to extract clinically useful and actionable insights. The proposed research will be executed via two aims:
Aim 1) Develop a multidimensional database from patients with SUD, via laboratory brain and physiological measurements and field physiological and behavioral measurements. We will use fMRI to measure ground truth of craving responses, while recording physiological signature during craving inducing or emotional cues. We will also collect physiological and behavioral responses using mobile phones and wearable sensors in the field. We will analyze the relationships among brain-biobehavioral responses and craving and affective profiles in laboratory and field settings.
Aim 2) Develop robust multimodal data science methods for craving and affective profile detection
and characterization: We will design 1) new approaches that positively transfer knowledge from multiple modalities to fewer modalities: we will combine data from different sensor sources while guaranteeing the model can be run with fewer sensors during testing, 2) craving and affect profile detection using regular/irregular characteristics and sparse weak labels, 3) craving and affect detection models with unlabeled data and a limited number of noisy labels, and 4) personalized craving and affect detection models with unlabeled data. We will evaluate our proposed data science approach using the data collected previously and in non-patient and patient pilot studies."
10887651,"The mammalian brain is particularly well suited for managing streams of (often noisy) evidence, both 
internally and externally generated, to converge to a decision. This evidence accumulation process can 
adapt to changing environments and reward opportunities, mediated by cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic 
(CBGT) circuits that both contribute to action selection and use feedback signals to modify future 
decisions. Dysfunction in how these pathways use feedback to guide future decisions is a primary 
mechanism for many addictive behaviors (e.g., opioid addiction, obesity). Our prior work has identified 
subsystems, which we call control ensembles, within the CBGT pathways that regulate dimensions of the 
evidence accumulation process, leading to various neural states with differing receptivity to the evidence 
streams that drive decisions, encapsulated in a particular decision policy.
We propose a series of empirical and theoretical investigations that bridge across levels of analysis to 
understand the flow of information through CBGT circuits during the decision-making process. On the 
theory side we will use our models to understand the low-dimensional representational space of CBGT 
circuits throughout the decision-making process, using energy landscape models coupled with 
dimensionality reduction. Using computational models we will model decision trajectories through CBGT 
networks by applying entropy based analyses to the network behavior and building predictions of observed 
dynamics in both discrete and continuous actions (Specific Aim 1). Empirically, we will test predictions 
emerging from our network model and provide new observations to support model refinement using 
experiments in rodents (optogenetics, electrophysiology) as they perform both tasks with dynamic reward 
contingencies featuring either discrete choices or continuous motor control (Specific Aim 2). Our theoretical 
and empirical work will evolve in a mutual-development cycle, with theoretical experiments being used to 
derive novel behavioral and neural predictions and empirical experimental results being used to revise and 
update the generative model properties that lead to subsequent predictions."
10891742,"Biologically important sounds, such as animal vocalization, speech, and tonal music, contain rich harmonics with
spectral energy clustered at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Although the exact neural coding
mechanisms for harmonic sounds remain unclear, recent experiments show that harmonic sensitivity is
widespread in the auditory cortices of the marmoset. Since cortical harmonic sensitivity spans multiple octaves,
it is derived presumably by combining subcortical inputs that typically prefer only a single frequency. We
propose to study harmonic coding in auditory cortex of the marmoset by simultaneous recording of many
individual neurons which are probed automatically by an online adaptive stimulus optimization procedure based
on explicit computational models of the underlying neural circuits. Conventional methods are incapable of fully
characterizing complex harmonic responses because of the combinatorial explosion of the stimulus space,
which is a general obstacle for sensory coding research. We propose to overcome this obstacle using an
adaptive online approach to harmonic stimulus design. We will apply two broad types of methods, one is to find
the optimal stimulus that best drive a neuron, and the other is model-based stimulus design that can effectively
identify each given model and compare competing models by finding the stimuli that best distinguish them. We
will develop: (1) automated system to characterize harmonic sensitivity of individual neurons across multiple
layers of auditory cortex using Neuropixels recording probes, (2) automated system to characterize harmonic
sensitivity in auditory cortex across multiple octaves of frequencies using two-photon imaging, and (3)
generative circuit models for efficient coding of harmonic sounds in auditory cortex. By restricting the stimuli to
harmonic sounds, which are complex enough but still tractable, we believe our methods are more likely to
achieve significant success. We have obtained promising preliminary results in several successful online
neurophysiological experiments using single-unit recording. Extending our online methods to Neuropixels
recording and two-photon imaging is a logical next step and may potentially benefit many researchers working
on related problems. We expect to obtain full stimulus-response landscapes of cortical neurons together with
inferred circuit models that may explain how exactly a higher-level cortical representation of harmonics may
arise from simpler input components, and all these representations will be examined in the context of efficient
coding of natural sounds."
10884300,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) are two common intersecting kidney diseases. CKD has been recognized as a leading public health problem worldwide, affecting about 15% of the global population. AKI can lead to CKD and affects more than 200,000 individuals across the US annually, with sequelae in distant organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs. To better understand the pathogenesis of kidney disease and potentially prevent the transition of AKI into CKD, it is necessary to define the heterogeneity of cell types and states, their associated molecular signatures, and complex interactions within the microenvironment. Emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies (e.g., 10X Genomics Visium) generate high-throughput spatial transcriptome data, which provides insights into the heterogeneous cell types within kidney health and disease. However, in contrast to organs with larger structural features like the brain, the kidney is organized into over a million nephrons with representation from more than 100 cell types arranged in close proximity. There are still tremendous computational challenges in identifying the colocalizing cell types and elucidating mechanisms in fibrosis, immune interactions, and epithelial repair. To fill such gaps, we propose to develop AI-based computational methods for studying kidney diseases based on spatial transcriptome data. First, we will build a deep learning framework to address heterogeneous, sparse, and mosaic-like cell type distribution in kidney injury, empowered by graph neural networks in a self-supervised learning training style. Second, we will compare the healthy and injured cell states to illustrate the inherent mechanism beneath the injury of CKD and AKI. Third, we will predict the effects of kidney injury with an interpretable generative process. We will evaluate the methods’ performances using the multi-omics data from the cell atlas of the healthy and injured kidneys in the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), and Kidney Precision Medicine project (KPMP). Our long-term goal is to create an eco-community for analyzing, sharing, and disseminating spatial transcriptomics data for physicians and bioinformaticians in kidney research."

Population-based studies identifying the genetic variants that affect complex human diseases have relied
heavily on population-genetic principles in important tasks such as study design, quality control, and genotype
imputation. The dramatic growth of large-scale genotyping and sequencing studies of disease generates new
challenges both for modeling the underlying generative population-genetic processes that give rise to evidence
of disease association in data sets and for performing statistical analysis to uncover disease variants. These
challenges magnify the potential for approaches grounded in population genetics to maximize the return from
ongoing investigations. Because studies thus far have often focused on populations of European descent, it is
critical that new methods provide tools for a greater diversity of populations. This project builds on productive
efforts in two previous funding periods, capitalizing on the study of human population genetics to enhance the
design, analysis, and interpretation of genomic studies of disease. It exploits the fundamental principle of
human genetics that population-genetic phenomena are responsible for homozygous placement of recessive
risk variants, and the recent recognition that accumulations of runs of homozygosity (ROH), and hence, of
multiple recessive deleterious variants of small effect in homozygous form, can contribute to disease risk.
Particularly for large-scale genotyping and low-coverage sequencing studies, in which rare recessive variants
are difficult to analyze, this project uses the population genetics of ROH to enhance discovery. The project
expands beyond the setting of rare diseases in small populations, building on observations that ROH and
accumulations of recessive deleterious variants of small effect contribute to complex disease risk in outbred
groups, including admixed populations. (1) We will construct models of the effects of interacting population-
genetic forces on ROH. Such models will make it possible for researchers to attribute ROH patterns to effects
of inbreeding, population size history, admixture, and selection against deleterious recessive variants. (2) We
will develop powerful new tests that measure effects of ROH on complex disease risk. These tests will employ
population-genetic models that incorporate features of genetic architecture and genomic parameters to assess
if associations between ROH and disease reflect the likely presence of recessive disease variants. (3) We will
differentiate between germline and somatically acquired homozygosity, leveraging signals in intermediate data
types and genotype distributions from population genetics, to identify false-positive ROH and to refine
detection of chromosomal alterations. (4) We will comprehensively evaluate the impact of ROH on medical
traits in multiple disease studies, using the Michigan Genomics Initiative and UK Biobank to test and inform our
approaches. The application of association testing between ROH and disease will contribute a phenome-wide
association study to identify traits for which ROH variables possess meaningful predictive connections to
phenotypes. To facilitate use of our methods, we will produce, test, and distribute new user-friendly software."

Our long-term objective is to fill the unmet need for treatments for heart failure (HF). Caveolin-1 is a promising
therapeutic target in fibrotic diseases. The profibrotic effects of caveolin-1 deficiency in cells and in mouse
models is suppressed by a peptide equivalent to its active site (caveolin-1 scaffolding domain, CSD). We have
shown the beneficial effects of CSD in two independent models of PO-induced cardiac disease [transverse
aortic constriction (TAC) and angiotensin II (AngII) infusion] and also in aged mice. In all these models, CSD
almost completely suppressed pathological alterations in ventricular function, fibrosis, and microvascular
leakage. However, CSD lacks suitable pharmacologic properties for drug development. To address this issue,
we developed novel, modified versions of CSD. We first divided CSD into three subregions (amino acids 82-
89, 88-95, 94-101) and found they all suppressed fibrotic disease in vivo. To improve their pharmacology, we
modified CSD and each subregion to be water soluble and protected from proteolysis. This modification also
enhanced their uptake by cells and increased their ability to inhibit several purified kinases in vitro. So far, we
have only had the opportunity to test the modified, water-soluble version of 82-89 (W82-89) in an HF model.
W82-89 would be an excellent Lead Compound based on its effects on cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and
microvascular leakage. However, because of the distinct pharmacological properties of our four modified
peptides, it is quite possible that another peptide is more effective than W82-89. Thus, to select a Lead
Compound, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of the four candidates. We will then determine the
Therapeutic Index (ratio between toxic and beneficial doses) of the Lead Compound. Specifically, we will: 1)
Select a Lead Compound using two model systems: AngII- and Isoproterenol-Induced HF. AngII and isoproter-
enol infusion are two frequently used, mechanistically distinct, model systems for inducing HF in mice. Studies
will be performed both in a prophylactic and in a therapeutic format (i.e. treatment begins only after disease is
established). We will consider these studies to be a success if a Lead Compound is selected that suppresses
the pathological effects of AngII and isoproterenol on ventricular function (Ejection Fraction [EF], fractional
shortening [FS], isovolumic relaxation time [IVRT]) and cardiac hypertrophy [heart weight/body weight ratio] by
>50% and the effects on fibrosis and microvascular leakage by >75%. 2) Determine the Therapeutic Index of
the Lead Compound. The dose-dependence of the Lead Compound’s beneficial effects will be determined
using doses above and below our current standard dose. Its toxicity will be evaluated in a Single-Treatment
Maximum Tolerated Dose Experiment using 1X, 5X, 25X, and 125X our current standard dose. We will
consider these studies to be a success if the Therapeutic Index is >50. In summary, these studies will provide
a novel Lead Compound that meets our Criteria for Success, both in terms of suppression of HF and of safety."

10907605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Infants born of very low birth weight (VLBW) account for 50% of all long-term neurological
morbidity among North American children; they commonly have sub-optimal growth and life threatening
morbidities such as necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis. It is now widely recognized that human milk (HM)
feeding is the best strategy to prevent serious morbidity in VLBW infants, yet growth and neurodevelopment
often remain sub-optimal with current one-size-fits-all feeding regimes. There is increasing interest in
“precision nutrition” approaches, but it is unclear which HM components require personalized titration.
Previous efforts have focused on macronutrients, but HM also contains essential micronutrients as well as non-
nutrient bioactive components that shape the gut microbiome. Further, it is unclear if or how parental factors
(e.g. stress, body mass index, diet) and infant factors (e.g. genetics, gut microbiota, sex, acuity) influence
relationships between early nutrition and growth, neurodevelopment and morbidity. Understanding these
complex relationships is paramount to developing effective personalized HM feeding strategies for VLBW
infants. This is the overarching goal of the proposed Optimizing Nutrition and Milk (Opti-NuM) Project.
Approach: We will leverage two established research platforms led by PIs of this grant: 1) the Maximizing
Mother’s Milk (MaxiMoM) Program with its neonatal feeding trial network and 2) the International
Milk Composition (IMiC) Consortium. This partnership unites the comprehensive nutrition and clinical
data (daily feed volumes and composition) and pristinely collected biospecimens from MaxiMoM (n=1105)
with the systems biology and machine learning pipelines from IMiC Consortium. We aim to define optimal
nutrient intake ranges (Aim 1) and microbially-relevant non-nutrient intake profiles (Aim 2) associated with
optimal growth and neurodevelopment and low risk of serious morbidity in different clinical sub-populations
of HM-fed VLBW infants. Additionally, we will explore the role of infant gut microbiota, infant genetics and
parent stress in associations between early nutrition and growth, neurodevelopment and morbidity (Aim 3).
Innovation: The MaxiMoM platform is unique in the world in terms of size, scope of nutritional data,
biobanked samples and longitudinal follow up data. The IMiC Consortium approach to studying HM as a
biological system using sophisticated modelling and machine learning approaches is pushing the boundaries of
HM research. Combined, these platforms offer an unparalleled opportunity to decipher how HM supports the
growth and development of VLBW infants, and to accelerate the development of novel precision nutrition
approaches for this vulnerable population."
10907609,"Project Summary:
 The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand how point mutations in
the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p63 cause different phenotypes in Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal
Dysplasia, and Cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome. The transcription factor p63 is the most critical
regulator governing epithelial fate specification and the maintenance of stemness in adult
epithelial tissues. Loss of p63 expression during mouse embryonic development leads to
widespread failure of epithelial and limb development. In humans, heterozygous p63 mutations
causes birth defects that include ectodermal dysplasia, orofacial clefting and hand/foot
malformation. Interestingly, p63 mutations in the DBD often cause different phenotypes in the
skin of human patients. This suggest the existence of p63 DBD mutation-sensitive enhancers
and their regulated genes.
 Our preliminary studies have revealed that: 1) p63 profoundly changes transcriptome,
chromatin accessibility and signaling competence of epithelial cells during skin development; 2)
signaling pathways that are directly relevant to hair morphogenesis, including Wnt and EDAR
signaling, are direct targets of p63. This establishes a molecular basis to examine the mechanism
of hair defects observed in EEC; 3) our novel R279C and R280C het and homo mutant mice show
different defects than p63 KO, revealing distinct biological functions of each mutation; 4) R279C
and R280C het mutations differentially affect critical genes involved in epidermal fate specification
and induction of hair follicles; 5) R279C het mutation affects the H3K27Ac levels of a subset of
p63 bound enhancers. Our hypothesis is that a subset of p63 enhancers is sensitive to p63 DBD
mutations, and their dysregulated genes underlie the defects in the skin of p63 mutants. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose to use systems developmental biology tools including
scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and their associated computational tools, combining with a high-fidelity
CRISPR-mediated knockin approach, to examine p63-controlled enhancers and gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) in murine skin. We propose to 1) investigate the role of EEC-associated p63
mutations in epidermal fate specification; 2) Investigate the role of EEC-associated p63 mutations
in hair morphogenesis; 3) elucidate the impact of p63 DBD mutations on open chromatin
accessibility, enhancer activity and genome organization. Success of these aims will provide
genetic, genomic and molecular insights into the etiology of birth defects caused by p63
mutations."
10905816,"1 This research proposal investigates the role of Myeloid Translocation Gene on chromosome 16
 2 (MTG16) in regulating colon cell identity during homeostasis, regeneration, and dysplasia.
 3 MTG16, a transcriptional co-repressor, plays a crucial part in stem cell function and lineage
 4 determination in the hematopoietic system. Interestingly, we found that in the colon, MTG16 is
 5 highly expressed in secretory precursors and goblet cells, implicating it in colonic goblet-
 6 enteroendocrine (EE) cell allocation. Correspondingly, secretory lineages in the Mtg16-/- colon are
 7 skewed toward goblet cells at the expense of enteroendocrine cells, positioning MTG16 at the
 8 regulatory locus for goblet:EE allocation in the colon. This occurs through MTG16-mediated
 9 repression of E protein transcription factors, key players in regenerative processes in numerous
10 tissues. Mtg16-/- mice also have increased sensitivity to colitis and colitis-associated dysplasia,
11 implicating MTG16 as an effector of colonic regeneration processes. However, just how MTG16
12 regulates these processes (i.e. genomic targets and repression complex composition) is largely
13 unknown, offering the potential for new therapeutic targets and interventions in IBD. Using yeast-
14 two-hybrid screens, we identified novel MTG16 interactors, including elongation-associated
15 factors, indicating transcriptional pausing as a new mechanism of MTG16-mediated gene
16 repression. Because MTG16 is expressed in both myeloid and epithelial cells, the observed gut
17 phenotypes could be caused by MTG16 loss in either population. We have observed that wild-
18 type bone marrow transplantation does not rescue Mtg16-/- colon phenotypes, and that these
19 phenotypes also persist in pure epithelial organoids. We hypothesize that MTG16 modulates
20 colonocyte identity during homeostasis, regeneration, and dysplasia by coordinating the
21 restructuring of epithelial transcriptional networks, thus promoting both stability and context-
22 dependent plasticity. Specifically, we predict that MTG16 enables the assembly of multi-protein
23 repression complexes to repress stem and enteroendocrine cell genes, and transcriptional
24 circuits, by modifying chromatin or pausing transcription, thus affecting colonic homeostasis,
25 regeneration, and dysplasia. We will test these hypotheses with three mechanistic, focused aims:
26 1) Define epithelial and/or myeloid MTG16’s contributions to homeostasis, regeneration, and
27 dysplasia; 2) identify context-dependent, colonic cell type-specific MTG16-mediated repression
28 targets; and 3) define colon-relevant MTG16 repression complexes. By unraveling MTG16's
29 molecular function and regulatory networks in colon biology, this project will provide pivotal
30 insights into the pathogenesis of IBD and colon cancer, offering potential therapeutic strategies."

10905326,"Abstract
Targeted protein degradation by chimeric molecules has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality. The
bifunctional chimeric molecules usually have one end binding to the protein of interest (POI) and the other end
directing the ternary complex towards the degradation in proteasome or lysosome. The PROteolysis TArgeting
Chimera (PROTAC) received the most attention to date. PROTACs contain an E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand to
direct the POI for ubiquitination and route it to the proteasome for degradation. Because of this, PROTACs are
only capable of depleting intracellular proteins. About 40% of the proteome are extracellular secreted and
membrane proteins and many of them are related to cancers. To broaden the scope of targets to include
extracellular proteins, the LYsosome TArgeting Chimeras (LYTAC) were recently reported by us and others.
LYTACs are created by conjugating a ligand of a lysosome targeting receptor (LTR) on the cell surface with a
ligand that can bind to the extracellular POI. The first two LTRs employed for LYTACs are lectins or
carbohydrate binding proteins: cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIM6PR) and
asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). The receptor-ligand interaction triggers the internalization of the
extracellular proteins through receptor-mediated endocytosis, further inducing the degradation of the targets in
the lysosome. However, CIM6PR is ubiquitously expressed in most types of cells, while ASGPR is mainly
expressed on liver. It would be ideal to recruit a LTR that is overexpressed on cancer cells to degrade
extracellular POIs associated with cancers to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. After examining a series
of cell surface receptors that are overexpressed on cancers, we found that chimeric molecules that recruit
folate receptor (FR) could degrade extracellular POIs on cancer cells highly effectively. In this application, we
will demonstrate for the first time that the conjugation of FR ligand, folate (FA), to binders of POI on the
membrane of cancer cells can create degraders that are capable of selectively degrading the endogenous
membrane POI on cancers. We propose to exploit the potential of this strategy to develop novel FA-antibody
conjugates that can degrade check point inhibitors, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), for the
treatment of various cancers with a focus on head neck cancers (HNC). In Aim 1, we will synthesize various
FA-antibody conjugates and test their degradation activity in cells. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the in-vivo
degradation activity and anti-tumor efficacy of the PD-L1 degrader in syngeneic and humanized mouse models
with a focus on HNC. In Aim 3, we propose to study the mechanism of the FR-mediated degradation of PD-L1
and the underlying principle for improved anti-tumor efficacy. These studies will facilitate the establishment of a
general platform for the development of efficient and tissue-selective degraders for cancer associated
extracellular POIs, which will lead to effective therapeutics for the treatment of many types of cancers."
10905417,"Project Summary/Abstract
 CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated success in curing B cell (CD19+) malignancies and has shown
promise in treating lupus. However, the cytotoxic and short-lived nature of CAR-T cells results in severe side
effects of immunopathology and reduces the therapeutic values of this costly therapy. There is an urgent need
for novel strategies to elicit potent and persistent tumor-specific effector and memory T cell responses and
minimize off-target toxicity in CAR-T therapy. This makes our work highly significant. T cell development,
function and homeostasis are regulated by T cell receptor (TCR) signals as well as cytokines and are suggested
to be proportional to TCR signal strength. Yet, excessive TCR activation and cytokine stimulation can trigger
excessive cytotoxic T cell activation causing immunopathology, with rapid exhaustion of anti-tumor immunity.
Our preliminary data show that IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK), a key regulator of TCR signaling, negatively
regulates CD8+ T cell homeostatic expansion and effector memory functions. The absence of ITK resulted in
enhanced effector cell fate programming, antigen sensitivity and anti-tumor immunity of CD8+ T cells in mice.
Our pilot experiments show that deletion of ITK in human CAR-T cells also resulted in improved production of
CAR-T cells that are significantly more sustainable in vitro, and have adequate tumor killing activity and minimal
tissue cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that ITK signaling can be modulated to promote CAR-T cell expansion,
survival and long-term anti-tumor activity, while limiting the effector cytotoxicity. We propose two specific
aims: (1) determine ITK's role in CAR-T cell expansion, function, and safety; and (2) develop a novel class of
CAR molecules containing modulatory domains for ITK signaling inhibition. Our work is innovative, supported by
exciting preliminary data that challenge conventional thinking. Validating this hypothesis will unveil ITK's role,
relevant signaling pathways, and biomarkers in CAR-T cell production, safety, and efficacy. We also propose
developing a novel class of CAR molecules that contain TCR signaling modulators, which will further our
understanding of CAR-T cell signaling and enable a handy production of safe, effective and sustainable CAR-T
cells. Completion of the proposed work will add to our knowledge of new molecular principles for the design of
improved CAR-T cell production, safety and therapeutic efficacy. Our pre-clinical results are directly transferable
to understanding human CAR-T cell biology and have the potential of improving of CAR-T therapy."

The use of autogenous bone graft is the most common clinical approach for bone regeneration. Although, the
practice has resulted in high rates of fusion success, there are challenges with increased operative time, limited
availability of autologous bone, blood loss and donor-site morbidity. Thus, there is a significant attention on
therapeutic agents that can promote bone regeneration, as suitable alternatives to autogenous grafts.
Meanwhile, the effectiveness of many of the current osteogenic therapeutic approaches is plagued by safety
concerns. We propose an innovative treatment strategy for bone regeneration that is based on Gpnmb,
discovered by our group. We identified Gpnmb (osteoactivin, OA) as a novel bone anabolic agent that also acts
as a positive regulator of osteoblast (OB)-mediated bone formation. The Gpnmb cDNA encodes transmembrane
proteins (~574 amino acids) that are heavily glycosylated with several functional domains. We found that the
recombinant Gpnmb protein (rGpnmb, containing 472 amino acids) derived from the extracellular portion of
Gpnmb possesses remarkable osteoinductive and osteogenic properties. A new peptide (Gpnmb-p containing
18 amino acids; 2kDa) derived from the intracellular portion of Gpnmb showed comparable efficacy with rGpnmb.
We observed that without a suitable delivery system, upon injection, Gpnmb-p diffuses way from injection site.
The thermoresponsive hydrogel platform will ensure that Gpnmb-therapeutics can reach fusion site (in liquid
form) while maintaining the effective dose at bone regenerative site through sol-gel transition that occurs at
physiological temperature. The overarching hypothesis of our project is that delivery of Gpnmb-therapeutics
using thermoresponsive hydrogels at the bone fusion site will promote osteogenic differentiation and
function as well as angiogenic response while minimizing off-target distribution leading to improved
efficacy and safety. The project will proceed via three specific aims: (1) To fabricate and characterize
thermoresponsive Gpnmb-hydrogels. In this aim, we will prepare and characterize thermoresponsive Gpnmb-
hydrogels using triblock PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA copolymer platform. (2) To assess the mechanistic basis by which
Gpnmb-hydrogels promote OB differentiation/function and angiogenesis. We expect to reveal and compare key
molecular targets that are associated with Gpnmb-p as a soluble osteogenic factor versus when it is applied as
a matricellular in enhancing OB differentiation/function and angiogenic response. (3) To evaluate efficacy and
safety of Gpnmb-hydrogels in bone regeneration. In this aim, we will apply the spinal fusion model in rats
(osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic) to evaluate in-vivo efficacy of Gpnmb-p-hydrogels. The project will provide
valuable evaluation of Gpnmb-hydrogels as a novel therapeutic strategy for bone regeneration with the potential
to serve as an alternative to autogenous bone graft. Mechanistic assessment of new and innovative therapeutic
targets of Gpnmb-p could have a broad therapeutic applicability."

This application seeks partial support for the upcoming Society for Muscle Biology (SMB) conference entitled,
""Skeletal Muscle Stem Cells in Development, Regeneration, and Adaptations"", which will be held July 14-19,
2024 in Esterel, Quebec, Canada. This will be the 12th edition of this conference focusing on skeletal muscle
stem cells (MuSCs) and the 1st sponsorship by SMB. This biennial meeting has traditionally been operated by
FASEB, but we decided to run the 2024 conference under SMB to allow the organizers and participants more
autonomy. This change lends to a more robust and vibrant SMB, which will focus on providing more support for
trainees. We expect approximately 130 attendees from around the world of whom ~50% are expected to be
women and ~60% junior researchers. No other scientific meeting has a primary focus on MuSCs. The need for
a conference with this focus is demonstrated by the steady increase in attendance since the meeting's inception
and the consistently excellent post-meeting evaluations provided by meeting attendees. This meeting attracts all
leading MuSC researchers from around the world, further demonstrating its value for established and future
leaders in the field. The overall objectives of this meeting include: 1) to provide a comprehensive analysis of
recent discoveries in the field, with the goal of understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling normal and
abnormal functions of MuSCs in muscle development, homeostasis, regeneration, hypertrophy, aging, and
myopathy; 2) to create and foster an interactive environment for the exchange of ideas and unpublished data,
so as to hasten discoveries and facilitate new and existing collaborations; 3) to provide opportunities for junior
investigators to present their work and network with senior investigators; and 4) to facilitate career development
of women and other underrepresented groups by ensuring representation in all aspects of the conference
program. Our keynote speaker will be Dr. Juan Carlos Belmonte, a renowned biochemist and developmental
biologist. Scientific sessions are planned, presenting 48 speakers (24 confirmed invited speakers and at least
24 selected from submitted abstracts) at all career levels. Session topics include: (i) molecular regulation of
MuSCs, (ii) MuSC aging, (iii) MuSC transcriptional states, (iv) MuSC activation and fusion, (v) dynamics of
muscle regeneration, (vi) engineering and translating MuSCs, (vii) MuSCs and friends during exercise and
growth. Invited speakers have been selected for their scientific excellence, with particular attention to equal
representation of women and minorities and geographical diversity. Speakers are explicitly required to present
unpublished work, to ensure scientific discussion is at the forefront of the field. We will have poster sessions,
each preceded by a “posters blitz” where poster presenters will give a one-minute talk to highlight their work;
career-oriented workshops and “meet-the-speaker” breakfast and lunch sessions. This meeting will provide a
forum to foster discussion and cross-fertilization from diverse areas of research, to advance our understanding
of muscle regeneration and aid in the development of therapeutics."
10908253,"Objective: Emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that men and African Americans have higher
mortality, and cardiometabolic risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, cluster in patients who
develop adverse outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Veteran population is particularly vulnerable to
COVID-19 because of the very high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. However, not all Veterans with
COVID-19 experience severe disease, and there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular pathways
underlying risk and resilience to COVID-19. Previous work and preliminary studies from our team have
demonstrated that targeted proteomics, metabolomics, and miRNA-omics can identify novel biomarkers and
molecular pathways associated with cardiovascular health and disease. In this project, we will use a multi-omics
to elucidate novel biomarkers and pathways associated with risk and resilience to severe COVID-19.
Research Plan: In Aim 1, we will compare expression of pathway-specific biomarkers in hospitalized patients
with severe COVID-19 with expression of these biomarkers in patients who do not develop severe COVID-19.
Pathway-specific biomarkers reflecting activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, systemic
inflammation, oxidative stress, immune activation, thrombogenesis, and myocardial injury and stretch will be
assessed. The primary endpoints for severe disease will be pathologic elevation of IL-6 levels or troponin I levels.
Secondary endpoints will be requirement for mechanical ventilation, congestive heart failure, change in SOFA
score, and death. In Aim 2, we will assess the extracellular miRNA and metabolomic profiles of the same two
groups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and determine miRNAs and metabolites differentially expressed
between the two groups. Subsequently, we will examine connectivity between miRNA-metabolome networks
and clinical endpoints in COVID-19 patients by performing an integrative analysis of differentially expressed
miRNAs and metabolites, which will identify metabolic pathways associated with severe infection.
Methods: The proposed studies will analyze de-identified blood samples and clinical data from COVID-19
patients hospitalized at the Atlanta VAMC and Emory University Hospital. The samples will be obtained from a
bio repository that is currently banking residual plasma and serum from routine laboratory testing of COVID-19
patients. In Aim 1, we will measure levels of aminothiol (oxidative stress), suPAR (thrombogenesis/immune
dysregulation), hsCRP (inflammation), hsTnI (myocardial injury), BNP (myocardial stretch), D-dimers
(thrombogenesis), angiotensin II, angiotensin-(1-7) and plasma renin activity. Logistic regression modeling will
be performed to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical endpoints. In Aim 2, we will use next generation
sequencing, RT-qPCR, and high-throughput metabolomics profiling to assess expression of extracellular
miRNAs and metabolites. A metabolome wide association study (MWAS) and ensemble feature selection (EFS)
will be used to identify robust biomarkers and develop predictive models for severe COVID-19. Data from EFS
analysis will input to the program xMWAS, which will determine connectivity between miRNA-metabolome
networks and clinical outcomes.
Clinical Relevance: Veterans with cardiovascular conditions are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and
severe disease progression. Our team has the infrastructure and methods in place to conduct in-depth, multi-
omics studies to address predictors of adverse outcomes in Veterans with COVID-19 and identify epigenetic and
cardiometabolic pathways that determine susceptibility to adverse outcomes. Furthermore, because 50% of the
Veteran population at the Atlanta VA Medical Center Veteran is African American, we are in a unique position to
address the role of race in susceptibility to severe COVID-19. Discovery of novel biomarkers and pathways
associated with severe COVID-19 has broad implications for screening, therapeutics, and implementation of
earlier personalized interventional strategies for attenuating adverse outcomes."

Candidate: Dr. Tweet’s long-term goal is to become an independent clinical investigator in the
field of coronary artery disease in women. Her short-term goal is to explore the vascular,
autonomic and microvascular phenotypes in women with a history of spontaneous coronary
artery dissection (SCAD). To achieve these goals, Dr. Tweet will: 1) acquire the expertise
required for her scientific aims; 2) improve her data analysis skills via coursework and
biostatistical support; 3) develop scientific leadership skills and collaborative relationships to
move this field forward. Environment: The Mayo Clinic SCAD Registry is the largest
international SCAD registry. Dr. Tweet’s primary mentor, Dr. Joyner and her Career Advisory
Committee have the expertise and mentorship qualities to guide Dr. Tweet’s career
development as a physician-scientist. Background: SCAD is a leading cause of
nonatheroembolic acute coronary syndromes in women. Most patients do not have traditional
risk factors such as tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. Rather, peripheral arterial
abnormalities such as fibromuscular dysplasia are observed in the majority of patients. SCAD is
associated with stress, exercise, and pregnancy. Recurrent SCAD occurs in 10-30% of
patients. Specific Aims: We will aim to assess arterial structure and mechanics (Aim #1),
neurovascular function (Aim #2), and microvascular function (Aim #3) in women with SCAD.
Study Design & Outcome Measures: This is a prospective study of women evaluated in the
Mayo Clinic SCAD Clinic. Measurements will include arterial thickness and stiffness,
sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity and autonomic responses to sympathoexcitatory to
standardized stressors, and myocardial perfusion echocardiography with dobutamine stress.
Relationship to Career Goals of the Candidate: The projects in the application will be
instrumental for the candidate’s career development by facilitating: scientific management and
leadership skills, acquisition of new research techniques, and generating interdisciplinary and
multi-institutional collaborative alliances. Thus it is the next logical step in her research career
progression. Relationship to the NHLBI Mission: The proposed project is consistent with the
NHLBI strategic vision for understanding underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of disease
and for improving study of diseases affecting women. It is consistent with the NHLBI’s interest
in hypertension, sympathoexcitation and cardiovascular disease risk. It is also consistent with
broader NIH goals related to training the next generation of clinical investigators."
10908256,"Background Abuse of opioids is an important problem for the Veterans Health Administration, with serious
medical, psychiatric, social, and economic consequences. Given the increasing prevalence of fatal overdose
and other negative health outcomes associated with opioid abuse, new and innovative treatments are urgently
needed. Melatonin is a hormone and neurotransmitter produced primarily by the pineal gland, which plays a
role in establishing daily and seasonal rhythms. Exogenous melatonin decreases both opioid tolerance and
the severity of withdrawal, which may decrease opioid-reinforced behavior. It also attenuates the expression of
morphine-induced conditioned place preference and decreases cocaine-reinforced behavior. Ramelteon and
agomelatine are potent agonists at melatonin receptors that are structurally related to melatonin and approved
for human use.
Rationale This project will evaluate clinically available melatonin agonists for their effects on opioid actions,
self-administration, and disruption of the sleep-wake cycle. Interruption of the light-dark cycle in rats that
increases oral morphine intake is associated with a decreased plasma concentration of melatonin. This
finding, combined with observations of diminished morphine-induced conditioned-place preference after
administration of exogenous melatonin, indicate that melatonin agonists may be useful as treatments to
prevent opioid use in humans.
 Recently, we found that pretreatment with the serotonin-2C receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist lorcaserin
increases the positive subjective effects of cocaine, suggesting a role for antagonists of this subtype.
Agomelatine but not ramelteon acts as an antagonist at the 5-HT2CR. This property, as well as melatonin
agonist activity, may decrease the reinforcing effects of opioids. Antidepressant effects of agomelatine may
also be beneficial in patients with substance abuse disorders.
 A preliminary open-label study noted decreased craving in patients with substance abuse disorders
treated with agomelatine. To initiate evaluation as potential treatments for opioid-use disorder, this project will
assess the effects of melatonin agonists with or without compounds that modify the 5-HT2CR using a rat model
of opioid-reinforced behavior.
Specific Aims:
1. Measure Effects of Ramelteon on Sleep, Tolerance-Dependence, and Morphine Self-Administration;
2. Evaluate Agomelatine, A Combined Melatonin Agonist and 5-HT2CR Antagonist; and
3. Assess Combined Effects of Ramelteon and Lorcaserin, a 5-HT2CR Agonist.
Methods Outbred Wistar rats will be maintained on a reversed light-dark cycle, with food- and morphine- self-
administration sessions conducted during darkness in the daytime. Rats will be allowed to establish opioid
dependence by self-administration of morphine. The duration and continuity of sleep and awake behaviors will
be recorded noninvasively each day when rats are returned to home cages. As morphine is withdrawn during
a one-week extinction period, melatonin agonists will be delivered either by around-the-clock dosing or once-
daily injection one hour prior to the onset of darkness (active periods). Effects on non-reinforced responding
will be recorded during extinction and reinstatement. Melatonin agonist treatments will be continued as rats
are allowed to reacquire self-administration of morphine.
In other animals that receive fixed, noncontingent doses of morphine and melatonin agonists, the entire sleep-
wake cycle will be recorded noninvasively; with subsequent evaluations for opioid tolerance, precipitated
withdrawal, and immobility during forced swimming. Antioxidant- and inflammatory- mediators will be
measured in brain tissue."
10908331,"This five-year plan for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity will equip
Dr. Diana Chirinos Medina with the essential knowledge and skills to help launch her career as an independent
investigator specializing in the development of evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk among vulnerable populations. Career Development and Training Activities: A carefully
drafted career development plan will supplement Dr. Chirinos Medina's expertise in observational CVD studies
and allow for an expansion of her skillset as an interventionist. The structure established by well-defined
training goals will ensure her career development and facilitate her transition to independence. The training
goals are: 1) to develop expertise in the collection and interpretation of objective sleep measures; 2) to gain a
deeper understanding of sleep disturbance and other quality of life issues in bereavement; 3) to acquire the
necessary skills to create and test behavioral interventions; 4) to strengthen the candidate's training in the
inflammatory mechanisms underlying CVD risk; and 5) to continue to develop grant writing skills and
successfully submit an R-level application to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The candidate will receive
guidance from experts in their respective fields (Drs. Carnethon, Ong, Fagundes and Miller) and take full
advantage of the strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University Feinberg School of
Medicine. Research Plan: In spite of the rates of sleep disturbance in bereavement and its detrimental impact
on mental and physical health, no study to date has examined the effects of a direct intervention on sleep
disturbance in this population. Therefore, it is unknown whether interventions aimed at improving sleep in
bereavement are feasible or effective. The proposed research project will focus on developing a targeted
behavioral intervention for sleep disturbance among bereaved individuals and testing it for feasibility,
acceptability and preliminary effects. The intervention will be based on existing behavioral treatments for sleep
disturbance, but will tailor its components to address the specific needs of the bereaved population. To identify
opportunities for targeting treatment and potential barriers to intervention, Dr. Chirinos Medina will recruit
bereaved individuals with sleep disturbance who will participate in focus groups (Aim 1). Based on the
feedback from focus groups, she will iteratively develop and optimize an intervention for sleep disturbance in
bereavement (Aim 2) and test it for acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effects (Aim 3). The primary
outcome will be sleep disturbance. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life and inflammation. At the end
of this research, the candidate will be in an ideal position to develop interventions for sleep disturbance in
bereavement and other populations vulnerable to CVD. In addition, this study will lay the groundwork for a
larger trial to test the efficacy of the targeted intervention in decreasing sleep disturbance and overall CVD risk
among bereaved adults."
10908334,"ABSTRACT
In the past 40 years, the prevalence of obesity has increased at an alarming rate. Even modest weight loss of
at least 5% improves clinical parameters and quality of life. Efficacious behavioral weight loss programs teach
participants behavioral strategies to create and maintain a caloric deficit. The two strongest predictors of long-
term weight loss in such programs are initial weight loss and dietary self-monitoring. Over time, these
phenomena decline, limiting program effectiveness. Financial incentives to increase initial weight loss and self-
monitoring are appealing because they can be delivered to large populations with relative ease and at low cost.
Employers and payers have begun to provide financial incentives for health behaviors and outcomes despite
an inadequate evidence base to inform the optimal design of such interventions. The proposed study will
evaluate which incentive approach has the greatest impact and durability—incentivizing interim weight loss,
dietary self-monitoring, or both. Studies testing the effects of incentivizing these phenomena have showed
some promise for increasing short-term weight loss. Few studies have evaluated incentive effects on long-term
weight loss; examined the mediating role of intrinsic or extrinsic motivation; or calculated program costs or
cost-effectiveness of financial incentive interventions. In the proposed two-site, randomized, single-blinded,
longitudinal 2x2 factorial study, known as “Log2Lose,” we address these limitations by evaluating the individual
and joint effects of incentivizing, in near real-time, weekly weight loss and dietary self-monitoring on 6-month
weight loss and subsequent weight loss maintenance. People with obesity from the communities of Madison,
WI and Durham, NC will receive an 18-month intervention comprising: 1. An incentivized weight loss program
for 6 months (Phase I), 2. An incentivized weight maintenance program for 6 months (Phase II), and 3. A non-
incentivized weight maintenance program for 6 months (Phase III). Participants will be randomized to receive
adjunctive incentives for weekly weight loss, dietary self-monitoring, both, or neither. We will measure the
proportion of participants achieving clinically significant weight loss of ≥5% at 6 (primary endpoint), 12, and 18
months. We will assess whether extrinsic and intrinsic motivation mediate intervention effect; calculate
intervention costs; and calculate cost-effectiveness ratios across the four study arms. Our financial incentives
intervention was designed to be scalable by using available technology and automating the process of
analyzing data to provide incentives in near real-time. The intervention could be paired with various weight loss
interventions offered by clinicians or payers, or integrated into a variety of patient and consumer-facing
technologies. Completion of this study will contribute to our long-term goal of identifying and implementing
efficacious, cost-effective, scalable approaches to reduce the prevalence of obesity and associated health
outcomes."
10908336,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent and significant public health problem. Behavioral treatments
based in the principles of social learning theory and cognitive behavior therapy have been developed and
tested for AUD, yet effect sizes are relatively small and rates of relapse following treatment are high.
Theoretically informed adjunctive interventions may help to enhance the effects of extant AUD treatments. In
particular, evidence suggests that environments lacking in substance-free (SF) activities contribute to the
development and maintenance of AUD and that the availability of rewarding SF activities may serve as viable
alternatives to compete with alcohol use. Building on the advantages of accessibility and low-cost option
afforded by the use of mobile technology, this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award proposal outlines a well-integrated research and training plan to investigate a mobile health intervention
to increase engagement in rewarding SF activities among patients in AUD treatment. This proposed research
aims to develop and evaluate a mobile phone ecological momentary assessment plus ecological momentary
intervention (EMA+EMI; entitled: mobile – Rewarding Activity Centered Treatment (m-ReACT)) app to
augment existing AUD treatment. The m-ReACT app will monitor self-reported rewarding SF activity
engagement in real-time and deliver personalized feedback that encourages participants to engage in highly
rewarding activities that are goal-oriented and support positive treatment outcomes. This proposed intervention
will be developed in two phases. Phase 1 will develop the m-ReACT app through a series of focus groups and
usability studies and Phase 2 will evaluate its efficacy in randomized control pilot trial with a sample of 50 AUD
patients who have recently initiated outpatient AUD treatment. Participants in the pilot RCT will be randomly
assigned to either the m-ReACT condition or an active control condition. It is hypothesized that m-ReACT will
result in increased rates of percent days of alcohol abstinence and increased reinforcement from SF activities.
This research plan provides the PI the essential hands-on learning and mentored training in development and
delivery of technology enhanced interventions, design and implementation of EMA+EMI platforms, qualitative
methodology, and advanced statistical approaches. Successful completion of this K23 award will provide the PI

Adult intestinal tissues are maintained in a normal functional state despite rapidly proliferating and
differentiating intestinal epithelial cell populations that replenish the epithelium layer every 6-7 days. Intestinal
epithelial cells reside in close association with both adaptive and innate immune cells of the gut. A reciprocal
and dynamic dialogue among these components maintains intestinal homeostasis and is mediated in part by
paracrine cytokine and interleukin networks. Intestinal inflammation predisposes intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)
to malignant transformation via incompletely understood mechanisms. We have generated a novel knock-in
mouse line that spontaneously develops perturbed IEC differentiation, gut elongation, and have a high
susceptibility to colon cancer. These mice provide us with a unique opportunity to discover the key
inflammatory mediators that regulate intestinal homeostasis and drive IEC transformation. Using
transcriptomic, proteomic, genetic epistasis and cellular approaches, our preliminary data implicate selected
immune cytokines in these processes."
10908479,"Superwarfarins, also called long acting anticoagulant rodenticides (LAARs) are modified forms of the
anti-coagulant warfarin, developed as potent rodenticides in the 1970's when rodents developed
resistance to warfarin. LAARs are up to 100-fold more potent than warfarin and have extremely long
half-lives (20 days or longer); one of the most commonly used is Brodifacoum (BDF). Increased use of
LAARs led to an increase in accidental poisonings, mainly in young children. Those poisonings, which
contain low amounts of BDF, are typically treated by providing plasma that contains clotting factors,
and giving Vitamin K1 supplements for a few days. However, larger exposures occur due to
unintentional (e.g. accidental spills) and intentional (e.g. suicide and homicide attempts) reasons; and
LAARs have been used in terroristic and military attempts to cause injury and death on civilians and
military, most recently by contamination of synthetic cannabinoids causing up to 400 hospitalizations
and several deaths. While VK1 is used to prevent mortality from bleeding, it does not clear BDF from
the body, so treatment can require up to a year at extremely high cost, nor does it reduce VK1-
independent LAAR toxic actions which can lead to neuropathology and kidney damage. In previous
studies we showed that treatment of BDF poisoned rabbits with cholestyramine (CSA), an FDA
approved bile sequestrant which prevents enterohepatic recirculation, increased survival from 33% to
90%. This proposal expands upon those studies, with the overall goal to develop CSA as a
countermeasure for LAAR poisoning to rapidly eliminate LAARs from the body. Studies will be done to
optimize the amount and timing of CSA needed to increase elimination in adult rabbits, using different
amounts of BDF as well as other LAARs; and the amounts needed to prevent the induction of kidney
damage and neuropathology. Studies will be done to confirm CSA causes LAAR clearance in both
male and female rabbits, and is able to prevent any consequences to neonates due to prenatal
exposure of pregnant rabbits. Positive findings will provide the basis for eventual clinical testing of CSA
in poisoned patients."
10908484,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cognitive function deficits are among the most devastating consequences of fetal alcohol exposure.
Currently available treatments against these deficits have limited efficacy. Our long-term goal is to
identify specific functional mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits associated with FASDs, so
that circuit-specific treatments can be developed to prevent and correct them. Our objective is to
leverage both in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological approaches to determine the long-term impact
of third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure (TTAE) on the limbic memory system. Our central
hypothesis is that TTAE disrupts the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission at
hippocampal formation→retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and RSC↔anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN)
synapses, leading to deficits in information flow within and between these brain regions. Our rationale
for the use of complementary in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological approaches is to provide a multi-
scale view of the effects of TTAE on functional hippocampal CA1, subiculum (SUB), RSC and ATN
connectivity. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of TTAE on the function of CA1→RSC and
SUB→RSC pathways. We will use slice electrophysiology, retrograde labeling, and optogenetics to
test the hypothesis that TTAE persistently reduces glutamatergic transmission at SUB→RSC
synapses, and increases direct monosynaptic long-range inhibition (CA1→RSC) and indirect
feedforward di-synaptic inhibition (SUB→RSC interneurons→RSC pyramidal neurons). We will also
use high-density silicone electrode recordings in freely behaving mice to test the hypothesis that
ethanol exposure reduces the number, efficiency, and information content of high frequency
oscillatory bursts in the RSC that are important for memory. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of
TTAE on the function of ATN↔RSC pathways. We will test the hypothesis that TTAE persistently
reduces glutamatergic transmission at reciprocal monosynaptic connections between the ATN and
RSC, without affecting di-synaptic feedforward inhibition at RSC→thalamic reticular nuclei→ATN
synapses. We will also test the hypothesis that TTAE disrupts the activity of ATN and RSC neurons
specifically modulated by an animal’s head direction that are essential in spatial learning and
memory. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will systematically
characterize, for the first time, the developmental effects of ethanol on interactions among key
components of the limbic memory network. The proposed research is significant because it will
elucidate novel functional neurobiological mechanisms underlying developmental ethanol exposure-
induced cognitive deficits, and identify specific biological targets for interventions to ameliorate them."
10908600,"Project Summary/Abstract: This K01 research and training award would advance my long-term goal of devel-oping and evaluating culturally and developmentally appropriate Latino youth alcohol use preventive interven-tions. Compared to Blacks and Whites, Latinos in middle adolescence (ages 14–16) are disproportionately at
risk for alcohol use. Although by late adolescence (ages 18-20) rates of underage drinking for Latinos is similar
to those for Whites, alcohol use risks (e.g., drunk driving, unplanned/unprotected sex) are more severe for Lati-nos. Normative adolescent stressors partly explain why many youth initiate alcohol use. Yet, Latino youth and
families face additional stressors related to prejudice, discrimination, and racism, leaving Latino youth vulnera-ble to higher alcohol use/related risks. Many studies have documented the impact of prejudice, discrimination,
and racism on Latino youth alcohol use. Yet, we know almost nothing of how to prepare Latino youth and fami-lies to live in a world in which prejudice, discrimination, and racism are part of their daily life. Evidence-based
preventive interventions for Latinos have not targeted coping skills for prejudice, discrimination, and racism.
Yet, it might be precisely these skills that youth and parents are lacking that are driving Latino youth alcohol
use disparities. Although, evidence-based preventive interventions for Latinos exist, Latino youth continue to
be at disproportionately higher alcohol use risk, suggesting that more preventive intervention development
work is needed. The overarching goal of my K01 research plan is to develop and pilot test a family-based
youth alcohol use preventive intervention that will equip youth and parents with coping skills to manage preju-dice, discrimination, and racism. My training plan will provide me with the skills necessary to become an inde-pendent youth alcohol use prevention scientist. I will acquire training in qualitative/mixed methods used in 
inter-vention development; the development and implementation of preventive interventions; and the evaluation of
preventive intervention outcome data. My training plan is directly linked with my three research aims. For Aim
1, I will use qualitative methods to inform the development of intervention sessions that target coping with prej-udice, discrimination, and racism. For Aim 2, I will create intervention sessions that target coping with preju-dice, discrimination, and racism. I will draw from strategies used in existing interventions and from Aim 1 focus
group data. I will seek feedback from youth and families before finalizing the curriculum. For Aim 3, I will pilot
test the intervention among Latino families; assess intervention feasibility and acceptability; and determine pre-liminary effect size estimates for the intervention’s promise to improve coping skills, family functioning, parent-ing behaviors, and youth alcohol outcomes. The proposed research will contribute to the first family-based 
La-tino youth alcohol use preventive intervention targeting coping skills for prejudice, discrimination, and racism. It
will provide me with the training, experience, and pilot data necessary for a fully powered randomized trial
(R01), facilitating the leap to independent investigator and Latino youth alcohol use prevention scientist."

the cultivation, connection, and synergy of clinician-scientists in aging research from disparate
specialties across the US. The Clin-STAR meeting is scheduled immediately prior to the BAM
with one overlapping day, providing greater opportunities for networking and mentoring among
scholars in the two programs, with the more senior Beeson Scholars serving as role models and
mentors to the more junior Clin-STAR meeting participants This competing renewal R13
conference grant will allow current and former Beeson Scholars to: 1) foster collaboration with
other Scholars; 2) nurture and develop a collective identity; 3) support career development and
promote leadership skills that help Scholars become independent investigators and leaders in
geriatrics and aging research; 4) better exchange research information and network more
effectively; 5) provide access to colleagues from different disciplines who are working on similar
scientific issues related to aging; 6) receive mentorship from nationally recognized academic
leaders who can guide the Scholars’ research and career development; 7) develop mentoring
skills by providing mentorship to more junior investigators attending the Clin-STAR annual
meeting and 8) provide access to organizations, programs, and colleagues that can foster the
Scholars’ growth and development. During the next funding cycle, we are committed to
incorporating additional innovations to advance the mission of the program. For example, we
plan to incorporate a cross-disciplinary mini-theme into each Annual Meeting and to further
leverage the Clin-STAR Coordinating Center resources with targeted outreach to the Beeson

10909140,"Abstract Project #3
Although professional and accreditation standards exist to guide identification of suicide risk, few jails effectively
screen for such risk at booking (Intercept 2). Given that individuals booking into jails may be less forthcoming in
reporting thoughts and behaviors to correctional officers, current identification practices are insufficient. It may
be possible to enhance identification methods in jails, replicating a method developed in community health
systems. Using a general population sample from seven health systems, the Mental Health Research Network
developed a suicide risk model to predict suicide attempts/deaths using electronic health records and insurance
claims data. Claims records were used to create the model that resulted in a risk score that could be available
for medical personnel, alerting them to the possibility of heightened suicide risk. Replicating this validation, using
a jail population with integrated Medicaid claims data, could result in a similar identification process for justice-
involved individuals available at jail intake (booking) that could assist in detecting who among those entering jail
could be at risk for suicide attempts and suicide deaths. Risk identified through the model will be compared to
the practice-as-usual identification within the jail. Because there is no standardized process for identification of
suicide risk within jails, each jail’s screening process will be assessed separately. This proposal would leverage
three geographically and demographically diverse jails in one state, increasing the generalizability of the findings.
Aim 1. Validate the suicide risk model with a jail population sample (three jails; on all of those who enter during
a specific length of time), using Medicaid claims and vital record data. Aim 2. Compare the risk flag to the current
suicide risk identification process (e.g. practice as usual) within 3 diverse jails. Aim 3. Evaluate implementation
factors to inform the design of a future hybrid trial and integration within jails, working with state Medicaid and
the Department of Health and Human Services. Improved suicide risk identification in jails could decrease the
adverse impacts that suicide has on those who are detained, family members, correctional staff, the institution
and community (i.e. liability, costs). Our long-term goal of this research targets jail systems by
implementing an automated ‘suicide risk flag’ – derived from prior health records, resulting in improved
detection at intake that would lead to intervention to reduce suicide attempts and suicide deaths within
the jail. The assembled team has experience with development of the model, familiarity and experience
implementing screening tools within jails, and integrating and analyzing jail and Medicaid data. The project
leverages an established partnership between the team and criminal justice system. This project will inform an
R01 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to assess whether the use of a suicide risk flag derived from this
algorithm results in access to evidence based intervention within the jail resulting in a reduction in suicide
attempts and death within these jail settings and post-release."

The overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) is to use a translational digital health and
computational approach to address the critical need for more effective early autism screening tools, objective
and sensitive outcome measures, and brain-based biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials with young
autistic children. We will achieve our goals by harnessing shared technologies, computational methods, and
clinical expertise across three Projects and with the support of three Cores: The Dissemination and Outreach
Core, the Data Management and Analysis Core, and the Administrative Core. The Administrative Core will serve
as the Center’s “hub”, coordinating and overseeing all Projects and Cores so they function effectively and
efficiently as a whole in an integrated and synergistic fashion. The Administrative Core will promote an inclusive,
equitable environment of communication and collaboration among investigators, reduce administrative burden
on investigators, provide financial oversight, monitor regulatory compliance, and ensure scientific rigor and
productivity. The Core will be directed by Center Director and Principal Investigator, Dr. Geraldine Dawson, who
will work closely with expert administrative staff, an internal Executive Committee, a Community Engagement
Advisory Board, and an External Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core has three specific aims. First,
the Core will coordinate communication, data-sharing, and collaboration among Center investigators to enhance
cross-Projects synergies, shared expertise and resources, and scientific progress through all phases of the
research program. Second, the Core will provide overall management and oversight of the Center. The Core will
oversee and support the Center’s scientific efforts by setting goals, defining deliverables, and monitoring
progress, ensuring timely advancement toward milestones and deliverables. Third, the Core will provide timely
financial accounting and ensure compliance with institutional, state, and federal research and ethical guidelines,
quality control, and cost-effectiveness. The Core will be responsible for providing expertise and infrastructure for
strong financial management; ensuring compliance with university, state, NIH, and other federal research
regulations; managing Institutional Review Board submissions and communication; developing and
disseminating Standard Operating Procedures; implementing Good Clinical Practice; maintaining research
fidelity; overseeing quality control; and ensuring timely submissions to the National Database for Autism

Dissemination and Outreach Core (DOC) will support this effort in three ways. First, we will facilitate
communication of findings to a wide range of audiences, including scientists, practitioners, educators, legislators,
autistic people and their families, and the public. Second, the DOC will promote bi-directional communication
between ACE investigators and the community of autistic individuals and family members. We will engage in a
wide range of community engagement activities that support our relationships and communication with the
community. We will promote bi-directional communication through the ACE’s racially, culturally, and ethnically
diverse Community Engagement Advisory Board (CEAB), which includes self-advocates, parents, educators,
policy leaders, healthcare providers, and business leaders. Two-way communication also will be promoted by
leveraging our existing strong partnerships with national and state-level government organizations, autism
advocacy organizations, and education nonprofit organizations. We will continue our partnerships with
organizations internal to Duke, such as the Community Engaged Research Initiative (CERI) of the Duke Clinical
and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). Third, the DOC will support the careers of students, postdoctoral
fellows, and early-stage investigators, and in collaboration with the Administrative Core, implement strategies to
increase the number of staff, students, and investigators from underrepresented groups and the autistic

is to evaluate novel digital behavioral assessment tools based on computer vision analysis and machine learning
that can be implemented in real-world settings to improve the accuracy of autism screening and enable scalable,
objective longitudinal monitoring of children’s behavior and development. Project 1 will recruit a large population
of 16- to 30-month-old toddlers through primary care clinics to evaluate the accuracy of a remotely administered
novel digital phenotyping application (app) for detecting early signs of autism. The app automatically quantifies
direct observations of children’s behavior using computer vision analysis and is deployed on a smartphone or

the digital phenotyping app for autism detection when delivered by parents at home. We will also assess the
app’s usability for longitudinal outcome monitoring of autistic children at 16-30, 36, and 48 months of age by
examining its convergent validity compared to standardized clinical measures. With a goal of expanding the
types of behavioral measures that could be used for autism screening and outcome monitoring, we will explore
the feasibility of using computer vision analysis to measure parent-child interaction from videos recorded at
home. Finally, in collaboration with Project 2, we will design an automated clinical decision support for primary

The overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) is to use a translational digital health and
computational approach to address the critical need for more effective autism screening tools, objective outcome
measures, and brain-based biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials with young autistic children. This Project
will develop and evaluate a novel digital health approach to autism screening. Universal autism screening is
recommended for children at 18 months. This is typically achieved via a caregiver questionnaire. However,
research has shown that a commonly used autism screening questionnaire has reduced accuracy when used in
real-world settings, such as primary care. By leveraging health data related to early medical conditions collected
as part of clinical care, Project 2 aims to develop an automatic, objective tool for autism prediction at 18 months
that can be implemented in primary care settings. We will use routinely collected health data to develop a
prediction model for autism and use the model to design a clinical decision support tool for providers that can be
integrated into pediatric primary care and includes actionable guidance regarding referrals and linkage to
services. We will first develop and validate a generalizable, off-the-shelf model to predict autism for use at 18
months of age using longitudinal claims data (Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield) from a diverse sample of
children across North Carolina with continuous coverage from birth to age 6 years (N ~ 230,000) to predict
likelihood of an autism diagnosis (N ~ 6,000). We will then adapt the autism prediction model to the Duke
University Health System (DUHS) clinical environment and augment it with granular electronic health record
(EHR) data by using machine learning-based natural language processing to embed provider notes. Through
engagement with stakeholders both within and outside of DUHS and in collaboration with Project 1, we will use
the prediction model to design a clinical decision support prototype that could assist providers in making
appropriate and timely referrals. Through the design process, we will identify a set of key priority factors to
consider when choosing a clinical decision support for autism screening that are applicable across a broad range
of stakeholders in different health care settings. Finally, leveraging our robust data on early health encounters,
we will describe the nature and prevalence of patterns of medical conditions during early life. We will test the

The overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to use a translational digital health and computational
approach to address the critical need for more effective autism screening tools, objective outcome measures,
and brain-based biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials with young autistic children. Despite significant
advances in understanding the biological basis of autism, clinical trials continue to rely on subjective clinical
observation and caregiver report measures. Objective, biologically based biomarkers are needed for use in
clinical trials that can parse heterogeneity, assess target engagement, and monitor outcomes. Autism biomarker
studies have utilized electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measures, which have found differences
between autistic and neurotypical individuals in neural and attentional processing of social stimuli. However, to
date, the majority of autism biomarker studies have used independent experimental paradigms and separate
analyses of EEG and gaze. Technical and computational advances, including machine learning and computer
vision analysis, now allow for synchronized measurement and analysis of EEG and behavior, including eye-
tracking, each of which provides distinct sources of information that can be integrated to improve biomarker
performance. Project 3 will use an innovative machine learning computational method to develop a multimodal
biomarker that combines features of EEG activity and synchronized measures of children’s behavior (e.g., social
attention) automatically coded via computer vision analysis. We will test the hypothesis that a multimodal
biomarker will show enhanced discrimination between autistic and neurotypical children compared to biomarkers
based on EEG alone. Standard and novel methods will be used to combine synchronized behavior (digital
phenotypes) and EEG features, with a focus on neural connectivity measured via traditional methods
(coherence, phase-lag index) and new network analysis methods (discriminative cross-spectral factor analysis)
developed by our team. This multimodal approach will be evaluated in 3–6-year-old autistic children without
intellectual disability (ID), age- and sex-matched neurotypical children, and autistic children with ID (IQ <= 70).
Multimodal biomarkers will be compared to three commonly used EEG biomarkers. Our goal is to develop robust,
brain-based biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials to evaluate early interventions for young autistic children
designed to improve outcomes and quality of life."

10909213,"Screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during well-child pediatric check-ups reduces the age of
diagnosis, allowing more time for critical ASD-specific early intervention (EI), which greatly improves outcomes.
Furthermore, universal screening mitigates disparities in ASD detection for children who are underrepresented
minorities and from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
recommends autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months for all children. However, current literature
suggests low fidelity of ASD screening, including (1) Inconsistent use of universal screening as opposed to
selecting which children to screen, (2) Screening children at only one instead of both 18 and 24 month well-
child visits, and (3) Not referring children for an evaluation and EI when positive screens indicate risk for ASD.
There is currently lack of knowledge regarding factors that predict screening fidelity and age of diagnosis,
critical in order to address the public health challenge of delayed detection of ASD. The current project uses a
pseudo-trial design to assess factors that relate to high-fidelity screening and to age of ASD diagnosis in a
diverse sample of at least 250 pediatric providers and electronic health records from a minimum of 27,000
toddlers seen for 18 month visits. Factors include child sociodemographics (sex, race, ethnicity, insurance
status); pediatric providers’ beliefs and attitudes, sex, and years in practice; and practice factors, including
size, resources, location (urban, suburban, and rural), and whether or not they are affiliated with an academic
medical center. The first specific aim investigates predictors of high-fidelity screening, with the primary
outcomes of referrals for evaluation and EI for children who screen at risk for ASD, and secondary fidelity
outcomes of universal (vs. selective) screening and repeat screening at both 18- and 24-month visits (vs.
single timepoint). The second aim investigates predictors of age of diagnosis in children with autism including
child, provider, and practice factors as well as fidelity of screening. The first two aims will be addressed using
random forests, a supervised machine learning algorithm that assesses not only which factors predict
outcomes, but their relative importance. The third aim uses mixed methods to identify potentially modifiable
healthcare provider and practice factors that relate to early detection of autism in primary care, through
quantitative surveys and semi-structured interviews with providers. This Project contributes to the Public Health
and Autism Science advancing Equitable Strategies across the life course (PHASES) Center’s aims of
investigating modifiable health determinants, inequities in health services and opportunities for mitigation,
especially in racially/ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged children, and impact of health services
delivery on subsequent health outcomes, through exploration of factors impacting high-fidelity ASD screening
and early diagnosis for all children, particularly underserved children, improving long-term outcomes across the
lifespan for individuals with ASD. Findings will inform future trials that can be scaled up in the community."
10909215,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
With increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in childhood, autistic young persons (10-24
years) are a growing, yet understudied group. The research gap promotes autistic young person’s vulnerability
to long-term poor health due to limited understanding of their health care needs and rising pressure on
services. Elevated cross-sectional rates of co-occurring conditions and service utilization are well-documented
in autistic young persons, but knowledge gaps remain regarding health and services patterns across age, and
relevant targets and their timing needed to guide interventions. Further, prior work suggests socioeconomically
disadvantaged or race/ethnically diverse groups are particularly at risk for compounded health effects and sub-
optimal service patterns. We hypothesize that there are distinct patterns of health conditions and health
services across age in autistic young persons which, together, impact future health, and the impact is
potentially magnified by socioeconomic disadvantage or race/ethnic disparities. Using national 2008-2023
Medicaid data for a diverse US population aged 10-24 years (1.5 million with 5-years continuous enrollment;
600,000 ASD, 975,000 non-ASD), we will model longitudinal trajectories over a 5-year period of health
conditions and services and quantify the combined effect of health and health services history on health over
the next 10 years. We will apply group-based multi-trajectory methods to (Aim 1) determine age-specific health
conditions trajectory classes (3 domains: brain; physical; behavioral health), and (Aim 2) health services
trajectory classes (3 domains: inpatient/emergency; outpatient; medications). We will also quantify impact of
health and services class combinations (Aim 3) on study participants’ health in the next 10 years using (a)
burden of disease metrics (disability adjusted life years, years of life lived with disability, years of life lost due to
premature death, health loss proportion), (b) risk of inpatient/emergency services utilization, and (c) mortality
(all-cause mortality; suicide; death due to unintentional injury). Across all Aims, we assess ASD vs. non-ASD
overall, as well as heterogeneity by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status groups. As part of PHASES’
public health approach, we employ robust, 2-way community engagement methods in all study years for critical
input from our community advocates, including autistic individuals, regarding all phases of our research. Our
team has the experience and study population knowledge to conduct these novel state-of-the-art trajectory
methods and health metrics, in this unique and diverse population based on 15-years of nation-wide Medicaid
data. This project will provide critical evidence on multi-domain ‘real world’ health and services experiences
and their effects on long term health, needed to optimize health interventions and outcomes for autistic young
persons aging into adulthood."
10909217,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The proposed study requests funding to conduct the most comprehensive examination to date of autistic
adults (aged 40+) as they age, with the goal of gaining a comprehensive national picture of health and mental
health outcomes and service needs. We will use analyses of national Medicaid and Medicare data
complemented by surveys and interviews of middle aged and older autistic adults and their caregivers. The
majority of research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been focused on youth, but dramatic increases in
the prevalence of ASD over the past three decades, the lifelong presentation of ASD, high costs of care in later
segments of the lifespan, and the fact that little is known about the estimated 3.5 million autistic adults in the
US who are over the age of 40, highlight the urgency of identifying the care needs of aging adults in order to
improve health and mental health outcomes, costs of care, and quality of life for individuals and their families.
This need for information and clinical guidance is underscored by emerging evidence of the early onset of
neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias and Parkinson’s Disease in
autistic adults. As the largest healthcare insurers in the US, Medicaid and Medicare are critical sources of care
for autistic adults as they age, and claims data provide a vital window for observing the prevalence and
emergence of conditions, including specific neurological conditions associated with aging, and studying
potentially adverse effects on health and mental health outcomes and service use. By comparing autistic adults
to those without autism, we can gain further insight into comparative needs and resources. Medicaid and
Medicare data are also optimal sources for studying inequities among economically disadvantaged individuals
and diverse racial/ethnic groups who disproportionately experience poorer health and mental health care and
subsequent suboptimal outcomes. We will link national Medicaid and Medicare data from 2014-2023, the latest
years available, data about mortality, and data about communities for autistic individuals ages 40 through the
end of life, and a comparison group of adults without autism. A Community Advisory Board of autistic adults
will be engaged to inform a survey of a national sample of 700 autistic adults (or their caregivers), as well as
interviews with a subset of survey participants, to yield contextual, real-world information about differences in
health and mental health services access and utilization at individual, family, and community levels. Pairing
findings from claims data with insights from the lived experiences of aging autistic adults will allow us to drive
patient-centered improvements in service delivery to move toward meeting the needs of autistic adults as they
age into a period of increased risk for health and mental health diagnoses. This research will generate findings
that are poised to identify and inform modifiable components of service delivery through these national
insurers, with potential for broad impact on the health of the autistic community."

PET and MRI offer complementary views of physiology. The ability to measure data from both modalities
concurrently has many advantages; in addition to perfect registration, it offers the possibility of studying
biological mechanisms in ways that were heretofore impossible to realize in intact animals, including human
subjects. PET and MRI are based upon different physical principles and generally reflect different in vivo
phenomena, so the availability of multimodal hardware and data acquisition raises new opportunities and
challenges for probe development, image analysis and interpretation. Our approach to PET/MR is therefore to
develop methods that exploit the complementary information from PET and MRI, including the creation of new
radiotracers, acquisition protocols, and analysis techniques where appropriate. In the previous funding cycle,
our pharmacokinetic modeling and radiochemistry efforts resulted in the development of imaging methods and
radiotracers for PET/MR enabling non-invasive measurement of neuroreceptor signaling with PET/fMRI,
mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiac studies with a voltage-sensitive tracer and extracellular volume by
T1 mapping, radiolabeled nitroxide radicals for imaging oxidative stress, and development of radiolabeled
nanoparticles. Our recent findings and collaborations motivated methods for improved quantification of tau
burden as well as mapping cellular membrane potential and demyelination as new directions. In the renewal
application, we will build on progress made during the first funding cycle and advance our technologies to their
next stages of development. Specifically, we propose to develop PET/MR imaging methods and radiotracers
for measuring cellular membrane potential in the myocardium and mitochondrial membrane potential outside
the heart, demyelination in the brain, and immune function throughout the body. Together these novel imaging
technologies span diverse organ systems, physiological processes, and potential disease applications that will
be pursued in detail through interactions with numerous Collaborative and Service Projects."
10939402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a blood and bone marrow malignancy, manifests as an aggressive disease
that requires immediate treatment. A key player in AML is the mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL or KMT2A),
found on chromosome 11q23. Mutations in MLL frequently correlate with poor prognosis, prompting a need for
therapeutics that can effectively target these genetic alterations. MLL is known to combine with over 80 genes,
creating chimeric proteins implicated in AML. Among these, ENL, a component of the YEATS protein family, has
been identified as essential for maintaining the dysregulated gene expressions that drive leukemogenesis.
 Targeting the ENL YEATS domain, a unique structure that forms an ""open-end"" epigenetic reader pocket,
offers a promising therapeutic avenue. Despite significant strides made in developing small molecule inhibitors
targeting ENL YEATS, these compounds suffer from limited efficacy, lack of selectivity, and metabolic instability.
The PI’s team has previously developed a number of potent small molecule ENL inhibitors. By coupling a newly
designed NanoBRET system for their cellular potency analyses, they identified a promising compound (Cmpd
13) that demonstrated favorable characteristics for further in vivo pharmacokinetic and animal efficacy studies.
Notably, Cmpd 13 significantly improved survival time for MOLM-13 xenografted mice, establishing it as a
potential orally administered therapy. In parallel, the PI’s team has also used a uniquely developed phage display
technique, in combination with medicinal chemistry, to identify a potent peptidic ENL YEATS inhibitor, tENL-S1f,
that has high cellular permeability and significant in vitro anti-leukemia effects. Additionally, the PI’s team
capitalized on the (Proteolysis Targeting Chimera) PROTAC technology, a breakthrough in targeted protein
degradation. Using this strategy, they designed a potent PROTAC, Gxj-47, that successfully eliminated AML
cells while demonstrating low cellular toxicity.
 Built on strong preliminary results, the PI’s team propose to significantly expand their multiplatform
strategy for the development of ENL inhibitors and PROTACs by pursuing three primary objectives: 1) To develop
more potent, stable, and selective small molecule ENL inhibitors and PROTACs; 2) To develop more potent,
stable, and selective peptidic ENL inhibitors and PROTACs; 3) To perform rigorous pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic analyses on these molecules, aiming to identify potential Investigational New Drugs (INDs)
for MLL-rearranged AML. If successful, this research holds the potential to revolutionize AML treatment,
providing a significant shift in treatment modalities, increasing survival rates, and improving patients' quality of
life. This research could also serve as a pioneering blueprint for drug development in diseases with similar
genetic alterations, thus having broader implications in the field of targeted therapy development."

The goal of this training program entitled “Training in Computational Neuroscience and Data Analysis” is 
to help undergraduate and predoctoral students gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to 
flourish in a scientific career that brings quantitative approaches to the study of neuroscience and 
behavior. This new program arises from a prior training program in Computational Neuroscience at 
Brandeis University that expired recently after 10 years of NIDA support. Given the increasing 
importance of machine learning in data analysis and solving of data-rich scientific problems, coupled with 
recent Brandeis hires in the field, our new program will include more participation from computer science 
faculty with expertise in the field. Also, given the recent introduction of an applied mathematics major at 
Brandeis and associated new faculty in the field, we have doubled the number of training labs with 
students working on mathematical modeling in neuroscience. The proposed program requests funding 
to support 6 undergraduates, 4 NRSA eligible graduate students, and 2 non-NRSA eligible graduate 
students each year. We will target two cohorts of prospective trainees: 1) Individuals with strong prior 
experience with quantitative methods who wish to work in neuroscience. 2) Individuals with backgrounds 
in psychology, neuroscience and biology who wish to learn to employ quantitative and computational 
methods to tackle important problems in neuroscience. We will continue prioritizing outreach activities 
aimed at ensuring trainees from underrepresented populations are included in our program. Students will 
have two complementary mentors so they participate in labs with both quantitative and experimental 
approaches to neuroscience. The 26 training faculty have research expertise ranging from human 
cognition to cellular and molecular neuroscience, so a wide variety of research problems, at numerous 
levels of analysis are available to trainees. The training faculty were chosen based on demonstrated 
commitment to the use of theoretical and computational methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to 
understand the nervous system in health and disease. Students will take courses in statistics, data 
analysis, computational neuroscience, obtain skills in building models of neurons, synapses, and 
networks, and employ these in a variety of independent research projects. In addition to course work and 
laboratory research, students and trainees will be engaged in a large number of other activities designed 
to enhance their speaking skills, writing skills, and ability to collaborate with other scientists. All students 
and trainees will receive training in the responsible conduct of science and will interact with senior 
scientists at other institutions."
10938144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the US, working-age adults (age 20 to 64 years) in rural areas experience significantly higher cardiovascular
(CV) mortality rates than their urban counterparts due to worse access to care and a greater burden of risk
factors. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further widen these inequities. The pandemic has resulted in
enormous delays in outpatient care for chronic conditions, as well as unemployment, economic loss, and
disruptions in insurance coverage, all of which have disproportionately affected rural communities. Together,
these spillover effects may worsen access to care and increase CV morbidity and mortality long after the
pandemic is over. Given these concerns, there is a pressing need to identify policy strategies to improve
access to care and health for rural working-age adults in the post-pandemic era. One such strategy that has
recently gained substantial public support is to expand the Medicare program, by lowering the age of eligibility.
Doing so could have major implications for the CV health of rural working-age adults, whom are more likely to
be uninsured and experience barriers in access to care. Telemedicine may be another way to address gaps in
care for rural communities, but nearly in 1 in 3 rural persons lack broadband internet access– a significant
barrier to telemedicine use. In 2021, the federal government passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, which will devote $65 billion to expand broadband in rural communities. It remains unclear whether this
substantial investment will improve telemedicine use, access to care, and CV health in rural America. The goal
of this proposal is to understand changes in access to care, as well as in the epidemiology of CV risk
factors, CV hospitalizations, & deaths among rural working-age adults before and after the pandemic,
and to evaluate distinct policy strategies to improve access to care and CV health in rural communities
in the post-pandemic era. In Aim 1, we will use a unique combination of national datasets to characterize
changes in access to care, as well as in the prevalence of CV risk factors, incidence of CV hospitalizations,
and mortality in rural working-age adults, overall and compared with their urban counterparts, in the years that
follow the pandemic. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of expanding Medicare on health care access,
screening for CV risk factors, and the treatment & control of CV risk factors in rural working-age adults using a
regression discontinuity design. In Aim 3, we will create a new, multidimensional data-source to evaluate if
access to medical care, including telemedicine use in the outpatient and hospital settings, and CV outcomes
improve in rural communities that expand broadband access using a difference-in-differences analysis. This
research will advance our understanding of changes in the CV health of >40 million younger rural adults, in
whom the onset of CV risk factors results in substantial loss of years of life. The identification of policies to
improve access, preventive care, and treatment for younger rural populations could have major public health
implications as the US emerges from the pandemic, and ultimately, improve CV health and equity nationwide."
10938088,"Title: Advancing Prevention Research In Cancer through Ontology Tools (The APRICOT project)
Abstract
Progress in behavioral research in cancer prevention is hampered by imprecision and heterogeneity in
research and how it is reported. Ontologies provide a way of addressing this barrier by promoting clarity,
coherence and interoperability across studies and data sets.
We have developed the Behavior Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO) using ‘FAIR Guiding Principles’ that
has been recognized as the most semantically rich ontology in its domain, and its user-informed method of
development as particularly innovative. However, it does not cover all the key classes and relations needed. In
addition, our tools for using the ontology are at an early stage of development.
We, the APRICOT team, propose three key areas of activity: (i) Extend the BCIO to cover additional details of
two key behaviors (tobacco use and physical activity), methodological features of studies evaluating behavior
change interventions (including links between measures and constructs), and causal links between intervention
components and mechanisms of action (processes of change). (ii) Integrate the BCIO and ontologies covering
‘real-world’ data such as patient records and census data to better address Social and Environmental
Determinants of Health (e.g., poverty, educational level, gender identity and sexual orientation, racial and
ethnic group, and built environment). (iii) Develop tools and resources to build engagement with, and adoption
of, the BCIO for, e.g., writing study reports and protocols, and synthesizing evidence for theory and
intervention development. To achieve this, we will foster and work with a cross-domain Community of Practice
(CoP) with members from diverse backgrounds, perspectives and roles.
Throughout the project we will follow FAIR Guiding Principles and established methodologies based on
science working with our CoP as stakeholders to ensure that the ontology and its tools and resources are
developed and implemented in a way that promotes widespread adoption and meets the varied and evolving
needs of users. We will work to ensure that the BCIO, its mapping to other ontologies and its tools and
resources can be sustained and enhanced beyond the life of the project.
We will use established methodologies to extend the BCIO and integrate (i.e., re-use classes) with, and where
this is not feasible to map (i.e., cross-reference) to, other ontologies. These include ‘top-down’ (expert- and
user-led) and ‘bottom-up’ (searching reports and data) approaches to identifying priority classes and relations
to add to the ontology and iterating the process of editing labels, definitions and other meta-data (including
cross-references) in close collaboration with our CoP to ensure that they meet its diverse needs. To upgrade
and extend our tools and resources we will continue to adopt our established methodologies of ethical and
efficient design used in generating the current version, again working closely with our CoP."
10939497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has been revolutionary in melanoma and other cancers.
However, only a subset of patients will have durable responses to first-line therapy and immune-related
toxicities remain a significant challenge. Given the critical, unmet need for safe, effective and broadly
applicable strategies in this setting, we will conduct a prebiotic food-enriched diet (PreFED) intervention
combined with standard-of-care ICI in metastatic melanoma patients. This study seeks to intervene on insights
from our own work and others demonstrating that (1) gut microbiome profiles and dietary habits predict
response to ICI in melanoma; (2) well-characterized gut commensals consistently implicated in ICI response
are highly responsive to prebiotic dietary interventions; and (3) the gut microbiome is a therapeutic target in
ICI-induced toxicities. With the overarching goal to test rationally-designed, microbiome-targeted dietary
interventions that cancer patients undergoing active therapy can practically implement and sustain throughout
treatment, PreFED is a scalable approach focused on providing multiple key microbiota-accessible nutrients
through provision of prebiotic foods and nutritional counseling to selectively stimulate beneficial gut microbes
that enhance and sustain the overall gut ecosystem. Nutrient and microbiota-derived metabolites from these
interactions support the central mechanisms underlying a favorable immune response to ICI (e.g., balancing
inflammation and effector T-cell function). Thus to further interrogate mechanism and test whether PreFED-
manipulation of the microbial community could be effective as an adjunctive therapy to ICI, we will transplant
paired patients’ fecal samples into germ-free mice to examine the impact of post vs. pre-diet microbiome on
melanoma growth and ICI response, as well as mucosal and anti-tumor immunity. Through these studies, we
will evaluate the effect of the PreFED on the gut microbiome, host metabolome, and the mucosal, systemic
and antitumor immune response to ICI. Integrative analyses of both human and mouse studies will provide
significant insights on diet-induced changes in the microbiome and microbiota-mediated changes in the
metabolome that influence the immune response to ICI – and highlight avenues whereby patients’ diets may
influence the success of other microbiome-targeted strategies being developed in this setting. Notably, to
progress to future multicenter trials with robust translational and clinical endpoints, we will define the safety and
efficacy profile of PreFED as an adjunct to current ICI regimens (anti-PD1 monotherapy, anti-PD1+LAG3, anti-
PD1+CTLA4). Though our studies will focus on metastatic melanoma, dietary approaches to enhance the gut
microbiome, anti-tumor immunity and ICI response are relevant and applicable to other stages and cancer
types. Accessible, appropriately refined and successful dietary interventions offer a cost-effective and safe
adjunct that could be implemented across practice settings and geographies, addressing significant healthcare
disparities and ultimately offering the potential to improve care for many patients."

Cells are exquisitely sensitive to the mechanical properties of their environment, altering fundamental processes
like adhesion, migration, cell division, and cell fate specification in response to how the polymers comprising the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and surrounding cells react to applied forces. Thus, environmental mechanical cues
serve as crucial drivers of development, homeostasis, tissue regeneration, and disease progression. To
understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning cellular mechanosensing, engineered systems are required
that can decouple the influence of multiple confounding parameters, such as matrix stiffness (elasticity), viscous
force dissipation, plastic deformation, microstructure, and adhesive cues. While there is an extensive body of
literature exploring how cells sense and respond to stiffness and, increasingly, viscous force dissipation, present
materials systems used in these studies are only capable of independently controlling one or two mechanical
parameters at a time and make use of chemistries that can react with biologically relevant molecules, leading to
altered material properties over time and potential off-target effects on cells. My lab leverages interdisciplinary
expertise in bioorthogonal chemistries, protein engineered biomaterials, and stem cell biology to develop new
platforms to study fundamental mechanisms of cellular mechanosensing under physiologically relevant
conditions. This includes developing new chemistries and hydrogel materials to enable simultaneous,
independent, and dynamic tuning of matrix stiffness, viscous force dissipation, and presentation of cell adhesive
cues within 3D organotypic ensembles of cells. Recent efforts have focused on the development of highly-
selective, stimuli-responsive chemistries to alter the stiffness and force dissipation rate of hydrogel materials on
demand to model changes that occur in various diseases and during aging. We have also developed new protein
engineered materials with genetically encoded viscoelasticity and are applying these materials to develop
chemically-defined and highly tunable 3D organotypic culture platforms. In this proposal, we extend our work by
developing new bioorthogonal chemistries that will enable tuning of viscoelastic force dissipation without off-
target chemical reactivity, permitting casual relationships to be identified in complex systems over long culture
durations without deterioration of material properties. We will also introduce new mechanically-labile crosslinking
chemistries to provide additional modes of plastic deformation induced by cells. Finally, we will address a
limitation of cellular force generation measurement techniques in native-like viscoelastic materials by developing
new force sensors through protein engineering and chemoenzymatic modifications. The platforms developed in
this proposal will be broadly useful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to
changes in their mechanical microenvironment and to study how these changes drive desired phenotypes during
development and tissue regeneration and undesired phenotypes during aging and disease progression."
10939572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The pancreas is smaller in individuals with diabetes and individuals at increased risk for developing diabetes,
suggesting that small pancreas size may convey risk for developing the disease. However, it is not known
whether individuals at risk for developing diabetes are born with a smaller pancreas or whether their pancreas
shrinks as part of the pathogenesis of the disease. Establishing the link between pancreas size and
development of diabetes is difficult, as the time course of diabetes progression is not well established and time
to progression can be long. However, pregnancy is a period of physiological beta cell proliferation that presents
a diabetogenic state with known and rapid onset. MRI can safely and noninvasively assay multiple aspects of
the maternal and fetal pancreas, including pancreas size as well as other markers of pancreas structure and
composition. Image acquisition and analysis will leverage our expertise assessing human pancreas size,
shape, fat content, and inflammation using multimodal quantitative MRI. We propose to perform longitudinal
MRI of the maternal pancreas over the course of pregnancy and postpartum and correlate imaging metrics with
diabetes development and metabolic phenotyping. We will also assess the capability of MRI to measure
pancreas growth in the fetus. Study participants will include mothers who not develop diabetes, mothers with
pregestational type 2 diabetes, and mothers who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. These
studies will establish the first model of maternal pancreas growth and multimodal imaging signature and their
interactions with diabetes. Our central hypothesis is that maternal pancreas growth will be altered by diabetes
and can be used to predict diabetes incidence in the mother. While the focus of this study is on the pancreas,
the images generated will encompass the maternal abdomen and entire fetus. Thus, the data generated will be
valuable datasets for secondary analysis of the interaction of diabetes with fetal development and maternal
liver, fat, and placenta dynamics over the course of pregnancy."
10940408,"A robust enzyme design strategy will profoundly impact human health, such as by achieving asymmetric
synthesis of pharmaceuticals not easy to be achieved by small-molecule catalysts. However, photoexcitation
has rarely been considered in enzyme design. In recent years, it has been found that certain enzymes can be
repurposed by photoexcitation for non-natural chemical reactions that cannot be easily achieved by small-
molecule catalysts or traditionally engineered enzymes. These enzymes, termed photoenzymes, are believed to
utilize photoactivatable cofactors, combined with a natural or mutated enzyme scaffold, to reach new reaction
spaces. Photoenzymes have emerged as a promising new class of catalysts for non-natural reactions important
in pharmaceutical synthesis, such as asymmetric radical reactions important in late-stage functionalization of
drug-like molecules. However, the mechanisms of photoenzymes have not been studied well and there has not
been a clear rational discovery and design strategy for photoenzymes, not only because these are emergent
systems, but also because existing computational methods are not adequate. In this research program, we will
develop an integrated computational framework to predict the combined effect of light, cofactor, substrate(s),
and protein sequences on photoenzyme reactivity and the mechanisms that lead to this effect, and will develop
a physics-informed design strategy that makes use of descriptors derived from both ground and excited
electronic states to control the activity and selectivity of photoenzymatic reactions. This will fill the gap in
computational enzyme design where the excited electronic states are not normally considered. In specific, we
will 1) develop machine learning-enhanced simulation methods to efficiently simulate both the ground and
excited electronic states of photoenzymes to assist mechanistic studies and to inform the prediction and design
of photoenzymes, and 2) develop a photoenzyme design strategy centered on descriptors derived from both
ground and excited electronic states computed by molecular simulations. We will use flavin-dependent “ene”-
reductases (EREDs) as the prototype system for the computational tool development and testing since there
have already been a collection of computational and experimental data for EREDs, where the computational
data are from the PI’s group. This research program will not only deepen our understanding of photoenzyme
mechanisms, but will also greatly facilitate the design and prediction of photoenzymes for non-natural reactions
important in pharmaceutical synthesis. In the long term, it will also facilitate the identification of natural enzymes
that may have previously unknown photo-driven reactivity, which may become new protein scaffolds for
developing novel photoenzymatic reactions or become new drug targets."

Widespread use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening results in 50% of new cases of prostate
cancer being diagnosed with low-grade localized disease. Standard of care for these cases is to defer immediate
treatment in favor of active surveillance (AS), a low-toxicity management which entails close monitoring with
PSA tests, repeat prostate biopsies and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). Around 30% of men on AS progress or
electively undergo definitive treatment within two years of diagnosis. Efficacious low-cost, low-toxicity strategies
to limit exit from AS are needed to reduce over-treatment and improve health-related quality of life (QOL).
 Accordingly, in this proposal we will test whether and how exercise alters prostate cancer molecular
landscape. Using a two-arm RCT design, 122 men initiating AS (e.g., inactive, diagnostic biopsy <6 months) will
be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to exercise therapy intervention (n=61) or usual care (plus general physical
activity advice; n=61) for 12 months. Exercise therapy will consist of home-based, treadmill walking five days
each week at 65-75% of their personal baseline exercise capacity. All sessions will be implemented using
TeleMed-X, a novel telemedicine platform pioneered in our program. Our central hypothesis is that exercise
therapy will reduce the number of nimbosus features to collectively inhibit clinical progression. This central
hypothesis is tested in three distinct, but complementary aims: Aim 1. Determine effects of exercise therapy on
molecular nimbosus hallmarks; Aim 2. Determine effects on the radiologic and pathologic nimbosus hallmarks;
and Aim 3. Delineate the precision of estimating rates of clinical progression at 18 months."
10910973,"The new Covid-19 virus is deadly for 0.2% to 4% of people infected, with older men the most severely afflicted
with this scourge, being mortal to ~15% of those infected over 80 years, making the US Veteran population
especially vulnerable. It is critically important to understand the mechanisms of this lethal pathophysiology in
order to design interventions that will save lives. MERS, SARS-CoV, and now the new human Covid-19 mean
that three coronaviruses have threatened to become horrific public health problems for the entire world; this
last and most recent one, Covid-19, has succeeded.
Some of the antibodies formed against this virus appear to accentuate the clinical severity of disease, possibly
making the specific details of the immune response responsible for the demise of many infected patients. We
have had more than two decades of experience as VA Merit supported investigators exploring the antigenic
structure of the lupus autoantigens, leading us to the theory that Epstein-Barr virus causes lupus, which is a
hypothesis now supported by convincing circumstantial evidence. We propose to apply our experience to
exploring the details of the fine antigenic specificity of the anti-Covid-19 antibody response in order to
understand what specific antibodies are dangerous. We propose to explore two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. Specific and detailed knowledge of antibody immune responses to Covid-19 will be
useful for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, predicting disease severity, designing vaccines,
selecting therapeutic plasmas, making patient care decisions, informing population epidemiology,
determining infection dynamics, and choosing individual behaviors in the face of the Covid-19
pandemic.
Hypothesis 2. Anti-Covid-19 antibody fine antigenic specificity will correlate with clinical
manifestations and infection severity.
We propose two aims:
Aim 1. Develop and apply assays to dissect the antigenic fine specificity of antibodies forming against shared
and sub-strain specific Covid-19 antigens in the natural human Covid-19 infection.
Aim 2. Isolate and purify anti-Covid-19 antibodies against the major epitopes and any specific antibodies that
are associated with severe pulmonary disease.
We will use Western blotting, solid phase assays (ELISAs), phage display libraries expressing 30-mer amino
acid peptides, and synthesized overlapping fmoc peptides to fully characterize the fine specificity antibody
response to the Covid-19 virus. We will obtain plasma and serum from Veterans and others which we will
evaluate for correlates with clinical outcome. We will isolate individual specificities and characterize their
properties with respect to type, isotype, glycosylation, and activity. We will perform pseudotype assays on
whole repertoires and individual antibody specificities in BSL2 and test for confirmation with neutralization with
collaborators with BSL3 facilities. From these studies we hope to learn how to identify Veterans who are likely
to have a more severe illness and provide clues for developing approaches that could succeed in ameliorating
infection severity and prevent severe disease."

Vaccination represents the single most effective and cost‐effective medical intervention devised to date, saving lives and
reducing morbidity and disability for billions of humans. Despite the early success of the oral polio vaccine, most
vaccines are delivered parenterally, and as such are associated with pain, non‐compliance, biohazardous medical waste
and the need for trained medical personnel. Moreover, strict requirements for production, transport and storage
logistics (the “cold chain”) are costly and present substantial logistical challenges. Mucosal (oral, intranasal, etc.) vaccine
strategies eliminate or significantly reduce these drawbacks. The potential use of Arthrospira platensis (commonly called
spirulina) as an oral vaccine delivery platform is highly attractive, given its safety profile, rich nutritional content and
wide acceptance as a human food source. Lumen Bioscience has developed unique, patented technology to genetically
engineer spirulina to express heterologous proteins. Lumen Bioscience's spirulina vaccine platform consists of
recombinant strains designed to express viral capsid proteins that assemble and form durable high‐order complexes
commonly called virus‐like particles (VLPs). Parenterally‐administered VLP‐based vaccines have been used in humans for
prevention of infections with human papilloma virus, hepatitis B virus, and malaria parasites. Intranasally and orally‐
administered spirulina‐expressed VLPs have been engineered to efficiently express pathogen‐derived antigens inserted
into the exterior‐facing VLP domains. Here, VLPs bearing epitopes derived from Plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite protein (CSP) in spirulina will be administered intranasally and orally to mice and non‐human primates.
This approach has been shown to induce systemic anti‐CSP IgG, which confers protection against sporozoite challenge in
mouse models. This project aims to optimize and develop the intranasal/oral spirulina vaccine model as a safe and
effective malaria vaccine using mice and non‐human primate models to enable a future transition to the clinic."

The development of antimicrobial resistance involves the rise of heterogeneity in populations of
microbes by uncertain mechanisms. This Unit is focused on the understanding the rise of cell-
states that we call enablers that give rise to treatment failure. Identifying these cell states
requires the development, sharing, implementation support, and analytical training of a broad
suite of genomics and bioinformatics methods for each scientific project. The key function of this
Core is to integrate methods, data, and support team members with their analysis goals. This
Genomics and Bioinformatics core commits to provide this support and analytical leadership by
establishing rigorous workflows for a wide range of nucleic acid library preparations. In addition,
we will develop and share a range of innovative bioinformatic analyses methods for assembly,
quantitative read-mapping, community profiling, and portable bacterial genome nomenclature.
Most importantly for the broader impact of this project, we will enable iterative, reproducible
inquiry of ‘omics data with bioinformatics training for trainees, staff, and collaborators throughout
the team.
In Aim 1, we develop and provide methods to analyze genome fragments or amplicons, including
gDNA sequencing, barcode sequencing, Tn-Seq, droplet-TnSeq (dTnseq), Deplete-seq (called
Enabler-seq here) and CRISPRi/Tn-seq. We will also continue development and economization
of RNAseq methods such as RNAtag-Seq, dual-host-microbe RNA-seq (dRNA-Seq), 3’-end map-
sequencing (3pMap / Term-Seq), and will develop the use of direct RNA sequencing to identify
transcript modifications or isoforms that drive enabler types. In Aim 2, we develop and support
implementation of a variety of analysis methods to turn these ‘omics data into knowledge,

10911822,"PROJECT 1: SUMMARY
 Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest worldwide health challenges lacking a clear path toward
a solution. Chief among the concerns are nosocomial diseases recalcitrant to antimicrobial treatment, turning
treatable illnesses unrelated to infectious diseases into end-of-life events. The source of this antibiotic
treatment failure (ATF) varies, but failure itself is remarkably common, with healthcare-associated pneumonia
resulting ATF in up to 70% of the cases. Although ATF is often tied to the spread of antimicrobial resistant
bacteria, a large proportion of cases cannot be so easily explained. Furthermore, the acquisition of
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) itself appears to be more complex than originally envisioned, as precursor
mutations appear to exist in microbial populations that may be required as stepping stones for the development
of AMR. These precursor mutations are enablers, resulting in increasing drug tolerance, persistence, or
heteroresistance, with the consequence that a subpopulation can remain viable in the presence of
antimicrobials allowing the outgrowth of resistant populations as antibiotic concentrations ebb and flow. The
central hypothesis of this work is twofold: these enabler mutations increase the evolvability of the microbe to
acquire antimicrobial resistance, and these strains having enabler mutations can be demonstrated to cause
ATF even in the absence of acquisition of clinically-defined AMR. To test this hypothesis, experiments are
proposed to analyze the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii, a causative agent of nosocomial
pneumonia that has become increasingly difficult to treat due to the acquisition of multidrug resistance.
 To study the connection between A. baumannii enabler variants, ATF and the outgrowth of drug
resistant mutants, a series of experiments are proposed that systematically identifies a large spectrum of
enabler mutations, including partial function lesions in essential genes. The enablers will be characterized to
determine the relative size of subpopulations that provide precursor pools for the development of AMR, in work
involving collaboration with Project 3 and the Scientific Core. This will allow an evaluation of the likelihood that
a variant will eventually give rise to AMR. Once the pool of enablers is identified, they will be tested under
multiple growth conditions for their ability to cause ATF in culture conditions as well as their ability to generate
resistant mutants. Similarly, the clinical development of ATF and AMR will be modeled in a murine pneumonia
model. This will be accomplished by first determining if acquisition of an enabler mutation, in the absence of
known determinants of AMR, can result in ATF, and then determining if enabler mutations increase the
evolvability to drug resistance during the course of disease."
10911823,"Project 2: Collateral Consequences of Enabler Genotypes in Antibiotic Treatment Failure
Antibiotic treatment failure (ATF) is of critical medical importance as delays in effective antibiotic therapy
promotes prolonged morbidity and increase mortality leading to overall poorer patient outcomes. While
antibiotic resistance is one primary mechanism for ATF, the roles for transient cell-states conferring
antibiotic tolerance, persistence, and hetero-resistance, herein referred to as “enablers” are increasingly
recognized as a major mechanism for bacterial evasion of antibiotic therapy. These enabler bacterial
populations are of considerable scientific and medical importance as typically precede the subsequent
evolution or acquisition of high-level resistance mechanisms, making these populations a “canary in the coal
mine” for understanding how resistance and treatment failures can emerge. Enabler mutants identified thus
far in central cellular pathways indicate commonalities for developing an enabler state suggest these
findings will be broadly applicable in a cross-species manner. Our underlying hypothesis is that the
collateral phenotypes of enabler genotypes can be identified and rationally targeted to optimize the
treatment outcomes and prevent subsequent acquisition of high-level resistance. We plan on using a
multifaceted approach to understand the genetic and mechanistic basis of enabler mutations. We will
experimentally select for enabler mutations using continuously variable antibiotic exposures in both
sensitive strains and those with defined enabler mutations. These antibiotic sensitive but tolerant
populations will be used to model the impact of different enabler genotypes on the probability and genetic
pathways to subsequent evolution of high-level antibiotic resistance, the role of these genotypes on
horizontal transfer of resistance, and how enabler mutants impact antibiotic treatment failure in vivo. These
enabler strains will be used to model how the respective genotypes, upon antibiotic exposure, affect key
pathways such as bacterial stringent response, transcriptional signaling, and translational fidelity, and how
this in turn leads to the production of enabler phenotypes. These lines of investigation will provide insight
into whether different enabler genotypes have common mechanistic underpinnings. We also plan to
examine if rational targeting of enablers could provide therapeutic benefit to either stop the spread of
resistance or improve antibiotic efficacy when enabler mutants are present. Enabler mutations are often
associated with collateral consequences that confer sensitivity or resistance to metabolic of chemical
stresses. We will determine the possibility of exploiting these cross-sensitivities by both targeted and
unbiased chemical screening approaches. These synergies will then be investigated for their capacity to
prevent emergence of enabler mutants as well as their capacity to more effectively treat infections caused
by enabler strains recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy. The successful completion of these aims will provide a
genetic basis and mechanistic insight into transient cell-states conferring enabler phenotypes. We anticipate
these findings will be applicable across multiple bacterial species given the likelihood of conserved
mechanisms underlying enablers and may provide additional strategies to prevent antibiotic treatment
failure during bacterial infection."
10911826,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Transient bacterial cell-states including tolerance, persistence and hetero-resistance (HR) are harbingers of
antibiotic treatment failure (ATF) and enablers of antibiotic resistance. Importantly, they are missed in any
currently employed diagnostic assay or antibiotic susceptibility tests. Intriguingly, in the treatment of different
types of cancer, physicians are often confronted with similar treatment failure issues. It turns out that these
epigenetic cell-states create extended opportunities for high-level resistance mutations to emerge. Moreover,
due to the phenotype’s transience, they themselves can directly drive the re-emergence of the (susceptible)
population after drug pressure subsides. While these cell-states are increasingly recognized as drivers that sit
at the root of treatment failure, new strategies are emerging to specifically identify, track and target them. To
achieve such highly targeted treatment, approaches are developed that map out the composition of complex
cancer tissue, for instance through single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), or computational deconvolution of bulk
RNA-Seq data. While, scRNA-Seq on bacteria remains technically challenging we found that by modifying
existing tools, specific bacterial cell-states can be identified in complex bacterial populations. However, the
capabilities of current tools are limited, and through the implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning
algorithms there is much room for improvement. Moreover, ATF cell-states are poorly characterized, making it
currently impossible to effectively define them. Herein, 3 aims are pursued to develop an approach that, based
on bulk RNA-Seq data, dissects a complex bacterial population into its separate cell-states, and calculates their
frequencies and MICs. In Aim 1 a large and diverse temporal RNA-Seq dataset is generated by following a wide
variety of strains and species while they are exposed to antibiotics and a subset of the population switches to an
ATF cell state. In Aim 2 a blind source separation algorithm is explored to design a state-of-the-art machine
learning tool that deconvolves bulk RNA-Seq data from a complex bacterial population into the cell-states and
their frequencies that make up the population. Moreover, by reconstituting each cell-state’s expression profile
we enable transcriptional entropy calculations and thereby cell-state specific MIC predictions. In Aim 3 the
approach is validated by retrospectively predicting the presence of ATF cell-states in patient samples. Finally,
the model’s applicability is extended to bulk dual RNA-Seq data from host and bacterium, and validated on
patient serum samples. This project therefore not only informs on how ATF cell-states develop and are
maintained in a population, but also creates a path towards the development of diagnostics that can detect them
in an active infection. Combined with the collateral sensitivities from Project 2 this could eventually enable linking
detection to targeted treatment decisions."

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), carrying genetic instructions for the growth, functioning, and
reproduction of most living organism, presents a critical avenue for exploring evolutionary
history, disease etiology, personalized medical interventions, and beyond. However, our grasp of
the role played by DNA sequences, especially non-coding DNA, remains limited. Unraveling this
mystery proves challenging due to the labor-intensive and resource-demanding nature of
experiments required for its decoding. Although computational techniques have arisen, they
grapple with obstacles such as insufficient training data to unlock the secretes within DNA
sequences. Inspired by recent advancements in natural language processing, we recognize
significant prospects for employing a similar approach to study DNA sequences as a form of
biological language. Our central concept revolves around developing an advanced DNA
language model. Aligning with the trajectories of its linguistic and protein structural counterparts,
our model holds the potential to reinvigorate the research of DNA structure and functionality.
This model serves as a versatile tool, enabling the exploration of various functions residing
within DNA sequences using an innovative multi-task learning architecture. Our initial
exploration focuses on unveiling the fundamental mechanisms driving DNA regulation. The
model is adaptable to various DNA functions under the multi-task learning framework.
Additionally, the model facilitates the understanding of the functional impacts of non-coding
variants, which has profound implications for genetic testing. Our innovative framework could
significantly expand the scope of variants that can be reported in genetic testing, thereby
enhancing our ability to identify genetic contributions to health and disease and guiding
personalized medical interventions."

10912725,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule in biological systems, but it is poorly understood due to a lack of
temporal and spatial sensors that measure NO. A direct, fast and accurate sensor for measuring NO would be
of immense value to ongoing and future research. Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) have excellent
potential for use as NO sensors both in vitro and in vivo, but they are not widely used by the research community
because they are not readily available in an easy-to-use platform. The goals of this project are to 1) develop new
SWNT sensor platforms and modify the current systems to improve sensor specificity and handling, and 2)
determine nitric oxide concentration and dynamics with a highly sensitive and accurate sensor. The goals will be
accomplished through the completion of four specific projects. In the first project we will develop a ratiometric
sensor to quantify NO over long time periods, the second project will involve the development of an easy-to-use
platform for the in vivo delivery and stabilization of SWNT sensors that are capable of both spatial and temporal
analyte quantification. Projects 3 and 4 will use the SWNT sensors to investigate NO concentrations, specifically
for project 3 we will determine the intracellular dynamics of NO in relation to organelles and membranes and
project 4 will involve the investigation of extracellular NO concentration values and gradients associated with
healthy and diseased cells.
This work will leverage the expertise of the Iverson Laboratory to engineer new and improved sensor delivery
platforms and use the sensors to investigate intracellular and extracellular NO signaling. By developing these
platforms a template for the development of other SWNT sensor systems will also be provided, allowing
researchers to learn about reactive oxygen species, small molecules and proteins in a spatial and temporal
fashion at the sub-cellular level. The investigation of the NO signaling for the cells investigated in this project will
provide researchers with a basic understanding of NO’s role in cell signaling and provide a template for
investigation of other cell types."
10912609,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY.
Cardiomyocyte cell state is dramatically altered during postnatal development. During this period,
cardiomyocytes terminally differentiate, fundamentally changing their energetics, functional machinery, and
mechanism of cell growth. Although we have a good understanding of the factors controlling embryonic heart
development, we still have a poor understanding of the mechanisms that establish cardiomyocyte terminal
differentiation during postnatal development and maintain this cell state in the adult. Critically, cardiomyocyte
terminal differentiation is integrally linked to cardiac remodeling and regeneration. While a terminally
differentiated transcriptome is necessary for cardiomyocytes to accommodate adult circulatory demands, this
transcriptional program also suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation, underlying the inability of the mammalian
heart to meaningfully regenerate after injury. Indeed, in model systems of cardiac regeneration, cardiomyocytes
must first de-differentiate and return to a fetal-like transcriptomic state in order to proliferate. Few studies examine
the factors responsible for maintaining cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation, but it stands to reason that targeted
disruption of cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation could unmask latent pro-proliferative pathways in the adult
heart and promote endogenous cardiac regeneration.
In this study, we will examine the role of the RNA-binding protein Muscleblind-like protein 1 (MBNL1) in
controlling cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation and cardiac regeneration. Although MBNL1 expression
increases during cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation and MBNL1 is known to promote fetal-to-adult isoform
switching of a number of developmentally regulated genes, it has never been examined directly for controlling
cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation or integrated into regulatory mechanisms surrounding cardiac plasticity.
Specifically, this proposal will use a variety of in vivo and in vitro genetic approaches to address the following
aims: (1) to determine the role of MBNL1 in maintaining cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation in the adult
mammalian heart and (2) to determine the role of MBNL1 in controlling cardiac regenerative potential. Insight
gleaned from these aims will characterize MBNL1-dependent post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
governing cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation and will determine if MBNL1 could be used as a novel
therapeutic target to promote endogenous cardiac regeneration."

Phase separation in cells can lead to the formation of biomolecular condensates, also known as membraneless
organelles. The material properties of these condensates are associated with various biological and pathological
roles. For example, the surface tension of a liquid condensate governs its interaction with both membranous and
membraneless organelles, regulating processes such as autophagy, vesicle trafficking, nucleoli organization,
microtubule branching, P granule growth, and cell surface signaling. Under abnormal conditions, several types
of biomolecular condensates change from liquid states to solid fibrils that resemble the hallmarks of
neurodegeneration. However, current understanding of the material properties of biomolecular condensates
severely lacks in two important aspects: 1) quantitative assessments of condensates in live cells; 2) a
mechanistic understanding of factors that control the properties and functions of condensates.
 Recently, we demonstrated the use of micropipette aspiration, a technique known for studying membranes,
in quantifying both the surface tension and viscosity of protein condensates, free from common sources of
artifacts. Importantly, our technique shares a large part of its core hardware with patch-clamp, a well-established
tool used by neuroscientists to record electrical signals in live cells and animals. In ongoing experiments, we
have applied the technique to several different types of biomolecular condensates. This includes proteins
associated with neurodegeneration as well as synapsin, a highly abundant neuronal protein that regulates
synaptic vesicle clustering and transmission. Furthermore, we have tested the compatibility of our technique with
cellular patch-clamp recording. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that micropipettes can be
broadly applied to understand the material properties of biomolecular condensates in live cells.
 In the next five years, we will first develop the micropipette-based technique into an accurate, broadly
applicable, and easily accessible tool for quantifications of biomolecular condensates in common cell lines and
primary neurons. This new tool will allow us to collect the much-needed quantitative data that can give direct
insights into the roles of condensate material properties in mediating a wide range of biological processes. We
will study the role of surface tension in governing the integrity of synapsin condensates, and the role of
condensate viscosity in modulating the dynamics of synaptic vesicle release and exocytosis. We will also
investigate the interplays between cell membrane mechanics and membrane-wetting condensates such as those
at synapses and tight junctions. On the front of pathological relevance, we will focus on elucidating condensate
material properties that underlie the aberrant phase transition of neurodegeneration-associated proteins. We will
take advantage of the cytosolic access of our technique to directly test the effect of drug molecules that are
targeted to intracellular condensates. Our quantitative studies of condensates in cultured neurons will also set
the stage for exploring biomolecular condensates in complex nervous systems."

The human tendency to discriminate emerges early in development: By 3 months of age, infants
prefer looking at same-race faces over different-race faces. However, it is unclear how these
perceptual tendencies translate to later racial prejudice and stereotypes. Previous infancy
research on racial groups has mostly focused on perceptual skills (such as classifying faces of
different races) rather than infants’ cognitive reasoning about and naturalistic behaviors toward
different racial groups that may be more direct precursors of racial biases. Of the few studies that
explore whether infants use race to guide their behaviors, there are conflicting evidences: Some
find that infants show more positive behaviors toward same-race than different-race people,
whereas others find no evidence of race influencing infants’ behaviors. Such discrepancy could
be due to these studies not accounting for infants’ experience with different race individuals.
Exposure to different races clearly impacts infants’ face processing; it is possible early social
experience with racially diverse individuals may also shape infants’ cognitive inferences about
and social behaviors toward people who differ from them in race. The current project will thus fill
a critical gap in our knowledge about how exposure to different races shape infants’ inferences
about and stranger fear toward different-race individuals in the K99 phase (Aims 1 to 2). Aim 1
will examine whether infants have differential expectations about intra- vs. inter-racial interactions
and whether racial diversity in their social networks and neighborhood environments relate to their
expectations about interracial interactions. Aim 2 will utilize large-scale, longitudinal datasets to
analyze whether infants show greater fear to racial outgroup than ingroup strangers, whether
stranger fear is modulated by neighborhood racial demographics, and how this fear may change
across development from infancy to childhood. In the independent R00 phase (Aims 3 to 4), the
candidate will integrate techniques learned from her F32 and K99 phases to examine which type
of exposure to different-race individuals most effectively changes race-based reasoning and
behavior in infancy and childhood. Specifically, the R00 research will examine if interactive
interactions with different-race individuals are more effective than passive exposure in changing
inferences, stranger fear, and neural activities toward racial outgroup individuals in infants (Aim
3) and children (Aim 4). These studies will help elucidate the developmental trajectory of racial
biases. This award will provide the candidate, who has a strong background in experimental
research with children, with training in infancy and longitudinal research techniques to facilitate
her transition to an independent researcher that can lead large-scale, longitudinal research efforts."

 Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer
death in American men.1 For metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), therapeutic options
include taxane drugs, docetaxel and cabazitaxel, Radium-223 chloride (Xofigo®) for bone disease, Sipuleucel-
T immunotherapy (Provenge®), and 177Lu therapy (Pluvicto®).2–4 Unfortunately, each of these therapies only
offers a short-term survival advantage, and mCRPC ultimately evades treatment. Like taxanes, monomethyl
auristatin E (MMAE) is a potent tubulin disruptor and known to inhibit prostate cancer tumor growth.5 However,
MMAE cannot be administered as a drug alone due to significant toxicity to normal cells.5,6 To overcome dose
limiting toxicity, MMAE must be conjugated to a targeting moiety. Small molecule drug conjugates (SMDC) and
antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver toxic therapeutic payloads to cancer cells through a cancer-specific
biomarker or protein, sparing non-target cells and tissues that do not express the biomarker. SMDCs and ADCs
can effectively increase the therapeutic index (i.e. increasing efficacy against tumor cells while decreasing toxic
effects to normal tissues) of the drug payload.7 To date, four MMAE ADCs are FDA approved; however, no ADCs
or SMDCs are approved for use in mCRPC. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well characterized
biomarker for prostate cancer with great success in targeting drug payloads (including 18F for imaging and 177Lu
for radiotherapy) for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. PSMA is expressed at low levels on normal tissues
but is overexpressed on >90% of prostate cancers, and expression increases as the cancer progresses to the
mCRPC stage.8–14 Cancer Targeted Technology (CTT) has developed a unique high affinity PSMA-targeted
scaffold that irreversibly binds to and is rapidly internalized by PSMA expressing cells.15,16 In addition, CTT has
developed a unique PhosAm linker attached to the scaffold that acts as a prodrug (CTT2274) and releases active
MMAE only in target PSMA+ tumor endo/lysosomes. Rapid drug release by the PhosAm linker is ideal to quickly
concentrate drug payload inside of the tumor cells.17–19 Using this unique delivery mechanism, CTT’s novel
backbone, and PSMA-targeting, CTT2274, has the potential to both decrease toxicity of MMAE and result in
substantial anti-tumor efficacy, offering a novel therapeutic for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. This
Fast-Track SBIR will develop and validate CTT2274. In Phase I, CTT will (a) perform process development and
optimization on CTT2274 synthetic procedures, (b) assess the pharmacokinetics of CTT2274, and (c) determine
the minimum effective dose of CTT2274 in a relevant model of prostate cancer. In Phase II, CTT will (a)
synthesize a non-GMP engineering batch and perform stability tests, (b) conduct a GLP acute rat safety/toxicity,
and (c) conduct a GLP chronic rat safety/toxicity study, Successful completion of these studies will establish a
therapeutic index for CTT2274, establish a future clinical dose and serve as the framework for downstream GMP
synthesis, large animal safety/tox assessment, clinical protocol development, and IND submission."

Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression are unavoidable at the single-cell level and affect fate decisions from
HIV to embryonic development. Yet, there remain fundamental gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms
generating and regulating expression fluctuations in mammalian cells. Addressing this gap in knowledge is
critical to therapeutic development in systems where fluctuations and heterogeneity present treatment barriers,
such as in HIV, stem-cell therapeutics, and cancer. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutics that target
mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity to overcome barriers to precise control of cell fate.
During the past 5 years, our work established mechanistic roles for noise and heterogeneity, demonstrating that
noise is a feature, rather than a bug, of biological systems that can be modulated for therapeutic effect.
Specifically, we: (i) elucidated a viral transcriptional-feedback circuit that harnesses noise to regulate HIV latency,
(ii) found this circuit to be optimized by evolution to function as a viral bet-hedging circuit, (iii) made contributions
to cell biology showing that transcriptional fluctuations are, in general, amplified by nuclear export and translation,
and, (iv) we discovered a novel post-transcriptional feedback architecture that efficiently suppresses noise to
stabilize fate commitment. Most excitingly, and most relevant to this application, we (v) discovered noise-
enhancer molecules that appear to substantially improve viral reactivation from latency and have been used
by other labs to increase noise in diverse systems (e.g., circadian rhythm).
The objective of this renewal is to identify molecular mechanisms of noise modulation in mammalian cell-fate
circuits to enable therapeutic control of noise. Based on our findings and extensive preliminary evidence in
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), our central hypothesis is that generalized `core' cellular mechanisms exist to tune
expression noise and that these mechanisms can be pharmacologically perturbed. Our specific aims build off
our unique tool of noise-enhancer molecules and will: (Aim 1) map the molecular mechanistic pathways of noise
enhancer molecules to develop a mathematical model predictive of transcriptome-wide noise in mammalian
cells; (Aim 2) map the molecular mechanisms of noise-suppressor molecules; and (Aim 3) to quantify relative
contributions of stochastic vs. deterministic mechanisms underlying HIV latency in vivo and safety &
efficacy of noise-modulating molecules in vivo. The proposed research has broad significance as it will determine
core molecular mechanisms regulating expression in disparate fate-specification models, reveal genetic targets
of noise enhancement and suppression that can lead to the development of new broad-spectrum noise
modulators, and propel clinical translation of noise-modulating molecules. Ultimately, the knowledge gained will
guide new therapeutic approaches to overcome barriers to precise cell-fate control across diverse mammalian
systems."

Sleep deficiency – defined here as an impairment in sleep duration, architecture, and/or circadian timing – is
estimated to be present in up to 70% of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In this
population, sleep deficiency is associated with adverse outcomes, including further cognitive and functional
decline, increasing the urgency for accessible tools measuring sleep and circadian timing across the continuum
of pre-clinical and clinical phases of ADRD. To advance our understanding of the link between sleep and
neurocognitive function in ADRD, feasible, accurate, and comprehensive tools that measure sleep architecture
and circadian sleep timing are needed. In addition, there is a paucity of information on the bidirectional
relationships between sleep deficiency, biomarkers of neuronal damage and plasticity, and ADRD pathological
proteins among persons with ADRD. Elucidating these relationships using measures of sleep architecture and
timing would advance mechanistic work and inform interventions to slow progression of ADRD.
For my Beeson K76 award, I am evaluating home-based measures of sleep duration, architecture, and circadian
timing over multiple days and nights in persons ≥ 60 years. We use a self-applied electroencephalography
(EEG)-measuring headband (i.e., an EEG-headband) to assess sleep duration and architecture and enhanced
actigraphy measures of circadian sleep timing (e.g., interdaily stability). Now that we have acquired considerable
experience in the use of comprehensive and rigorous measures of sleep deficiency in persons without ADRD,
we propose to extend this work to persons with ADRD. Working with Yale's Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center, we will enroll 45 persons with ADRD to evaluate the performance of the EEG-headband and evaluate
cross-sectional relationships between distinct sleep deficiency domains and serum levels of neuronal damage
and plasticity (brain derived neurotrophic factor, neurofilament light chain) and ADRD pathological proteins (tau,
amyloid-β).
The findings from this work will inform the design of a larger, longitudinal study on causal associations between
sleep deficiency, neuronal damage/plasticity, and ADRD pathology. Ultimately, this work may elucidate
mechanisms, improve prognostication, and establish targets for future sleep-promoting interventions to slow
progression of disease and improve quality of life in persons with ADRD."
10911157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Helminth parasites, including hookworms, infect approximately 2 billion people worldwide and represent a
significant public health concern. To combat these parasites, the mammalian immune system has evolved
mechanisms to maintain a delicate balance between promoting beneficial inflammation needed to reduce
parasitic burdens, but also subsequently restricting that inflammation once the infectious threat is eliminated.
When properly regulated, this allows for protective immunity to be achieved without the development of
unwanted immunopathology. It is well established that type 2 inflammation, characteristic of helminth-induced
immune responses in humans and mice, is initiated via the production of type 2 cytokines by group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and type 2 T helper (TH2) cells. The activation of both innate and adaptive lymphocytes
results in the induction of smooth muscle contraction, eosinophilia, mucus production and the population
expansion of basophils. Despite our knowledge of the factors that promote type 2 inflammation, the
mechanisms that restrict its ability to promote immunopathology remain poorly defined. Our preliminary
studies revealed that helminth-induced ILC2 responses, type 2 cytokine production, lung eosinophilia and
mucus production are significantly elevated following the depletion of basophils. Moreover, depletion of
basophils resulted in dramatic lung pathology and decreased lung function. Strikingly, our new studies also
revealed that ILC2s activated in the absence of basophils failed to upregulate expression of the receptor for the
neuropeptide neuromedin b (Nmb). Further, delivery of Nmb to helminth-infected mice resulted in reduced
ILC2 responses, eosinophilia and mucus production. These data suggest that Nmb is a potent inhibitor of type
2 inflammation. Nmb belongs to the bombesin-like family of neuropeptides consisting of neuromedin B, N, S
and U. Importantly, neuromedin U was recently shown to be an important positive regulator of helminth-
induced ILC2 responses. Collectively, our studies suggesting that Nmu and Nmb operate as neuropeptide
‘rheostat’ that properly balances helminth-induced inflammation. Based on our strong preliminary studies and
generation of novel Nmbr-floxed and Nmur-Cre mouse models, three specific aims will address the following
questions: (i) Do helminth-induced basophils regulate Neuromedin b receptor expression on immune cells, (ii)
Does Nmb restrict the activation of multiple immune cells in a manner that properly regulates helminth-induced
inflammation, and (iii) Do Nmu and Nmb directly counterbalance each other and operate as a neuropeptide
rheostat? Collectively, these studies will interrogate novel mechanisms through which type 2 cytokine-
mediated immunity and inflammation are negatively regulated. Defining the mechanisms through which
basophils initiate a Nmu/Nmb-mediated rheostat may inform new therapeutic strategies to treat helminth-
induced immunopathology."

can be interpreted, localized, and integrated with information from the other senses. A human listener can

combination allows us to track how transformations in perceptual representations are distributed and
instantiated in the brain; to experiment with multiple ANN architectures and tasks to test hypotheses about
why the representations take the forms we observe; and to refine iteratively our stimulus protocols and
models. Our objectives are (1) to evaluate these ANNs as encoding models for neurons in macaque
auditory cortex, recorded during auditory discrimination tasks; (2) to use the internal structure of ANNs to
generate and test novel hypotheses about the topographical and hierarchical organization of non-primary
auditory cortex; and (3) to demonstrate “stimulus- based control” of neurons throughout nonprimary
auditory cortex: optimizing stimuli via the ANN and then playing to the animals in closed-loop
neurophysiology experiments."
10937668,"SUMMARY:
Acquiring extracellular genetic and functional novelty can forever change the evolutionary trajectory of
organisms, from mitochondria to antibiotic resistance to placental formation. Retroviruses heritable through the
germline, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), comprise eight percent of the human genome (four times more than
protein coding sequence). The vast majority of ERVs lack all protein coding potential. A select few ERV genes
have been preserved over evolutionary timescales, a strong indication that these specific genes are beneficial.
env is the most frequently preserved ERV gene. In retroviruses, env encodes a glycoprotein that interacts with
specific cellular receptors and is the virus-cell membrane fusogen. These activities have been repurposed by a
pair of ERV envs that form the syncytiotrophoblast, an essential placental structure of fused cells at the maternal-
fetal interface. Divergent envs have been coopted by different mammalian lineages for the same function.
Knowledge of how ERV genes are acquired and repurposed is largely restricted to DNA and mRNA, while it is
typically the proteins that carry out their functions. A dearth of quality reagents for ERV proteins has impeded
our ability to define when, where, and why these proteins are expressed. We will leverage our expertise as
evolutionary biologists, protein biochemists, and B cell immunologists to move ERV research into the proteome
by generating, quality controlling, and disseminating the reagents required for this transition. Our primary focus
is EnvP(b)1, an env preserved for >40 million years with no known function. Evolution has maintained its
membrane fusion activity across human, ape and monkey orthologs. Expression in cultured cells results in fused
monolayers of multinucleated cells and rapid cell death. Expression in vivo must therefore be tightly regulated,
and its activity tailored to its function. We find genetic and functional evidence of evolutionary refinement of
EnvP(b)1 over the past >40 million years. We will, in vitro, define the tissue and species specificities of membrane
fusion by human and non-human primate (NHP) EnvP(b)1 orthologs. Using ancestral reconstruction, we will
determine how EnvP(b)1 function evolved to its present form across primate lineages. Given its cytotoxicity and
ability to produce cells with variable chromosomal content, the preservation of EnvP(b)1 indicates it must perform
critical functions. We will define the anatomical sites and context of EnvP(b)1 protein expression in humans and
NHPs, and if cell-cell fusion occurs at these sites. This work will ultimately establish NHP models required to
define the function and explain why EnvP(b)1 is maintained. Using a carefully controlled antibody reagent, we
find EnvP(b)1 protein expression in healthy human and NHP tissues, including placenta. The placenta, a rapidly
evolving structure, is a hotbed of functional ERV Env expression. We will develop the reagents needed to dissect
the roles and regulation of at least eight unique ERV Envs expressed in this tissue. This work will define new
human biology and raise the questions of how do species without these elements do the same thing and do
standard small animal models fail to capture the biology of these elements that are largely primate-specific?"
10937671,"Heart Failure (HF) is a multi-faceted syndrome characterized by significant morbidity and mortality.
Hereditary cardiomyopathies are common causes of HF - notable among them being mutations in Lamin gene
that cause progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and severe HF (LMNA-DCM). Irrespective of the etiology, the
development and progression of HF is associated with several features, including mitochondrial dysfunction,
alterations in sarcomere composition, and metabolic dysregulation. These pathological changes are preceded
and/or accompanied by changes in gene expression driven by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone
modifications. Importance of epigenetic regulators are beginning to emerge in HF. However, the roles of Histone
demethylases, especially H3K4 demethylases, despite their critical role in gene expression regulation, remain
largely unknown in HF. The major regulators of the H3K4 methylation state are KDM5 family of demethylases,
which suppress gene expression by eliminating the methyl moieties from H3K4 (H3K4me3→H3K4). The
proposed research is motivated by our recent findings of KDM5A and KDM5B dysregulation in human HF and
mouse models of LMNA-DCM, as well as preliminary results demonstrating activation of KDM5A and KDM5B in
the heart of mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Furthermore, our preliminary data also show
that deletion of Kdm5a improved cardiac function and increased survival in an LMNA-DCM mouse model (Myh6-
Cre: LmnaF/F), and suppression of KDM5 in vitro and deletion of Kdm5a in LMNA-DCM mouse model induced
expression of its target genes, a subset are involved in oxidative phosphorylation metabolism and sarcomere
formation. The data suggest broad pathogenic role of KDM5 in HF. However, neither the individual nor combined
actions of KDM5A and KDM5B, as well as their precise molecular targets in CM in HF, are known. As a result,
the goal of this project is to determine the pathogenic roles and molecular targets of KDM5A and B in LMNA-
DCM and HF. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism(s) of phenotypic rescue following Kdm5a and Kdm5b deletion
in a mouse model of LMNA-DCM. Aim 2 broadens the scope of the investigation by determining the pathogenic
roles and molecular mechanisms of KDM5A and KDM5B in pressure-overload-induced HF. In Aim3, we will
investigate cause and effect by re-expressing KDM5A and KDM5B in CM using dox-inducible bigenic mice, and
determining its sufficiency to induce cardiac dysfunction and HF, as well as their reversal when gene is switched
off by Dox withdrawal. The molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic changes will be investigated utilizing RNA-
seq and CUT&RUN assays in CM, with the latter mapping genomic occupancy of KDM5A, KDM5B, and
H3K4me3. The effect of KDM5A and B on genome-wide chromatin accessibility in CM, which leads to gene
dysregulation, will be investigated using ATAC-seq. At the conclusion of the study, we will ascertain the
pathogenic roles of KDM5A and B and their molecular mechanisms. The findings may pave the way for the future
development of specific treatment for targeting KDM5A and KDM5B proteins in DCM and HF."

10939137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is an application for a K23 Mentored Career Development Award for Dr. Ashley Jenkins, a dually trained
Internal Medicine and Pediatrics (Med-Peds) hospitalist. Dr. Jenkins career goal is to become an independent
researcher who uses patient-engaged approaches and implementation science to improve hospital care and
promote health equity for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Over 100,000 people in the US live with SCD,
the majority of whom are people of color and living in poverty. People with SCD experience extremely painful
vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE). VOE can be fatal, yet patients avoid hospitalization for severe VOE for the
same reasons they avoid ED visits: clinicians lack SCD knowledge, disease stigma, racial bias, and
complications of health system complexity like long wait times. Care delays for severe VOE add to the risk of
death. Hence, improving VOE inpatient care may not only mitigate negative healthcare experiences for
patients with SCD, but also decrease their risk of death. The NHLBI recommends use of patient-specific
protocols, or individualized care plans (ICPs), for acute VOE care. ICPs include patient-specific
recommendations for VOE care like pain medications. When tested in the ED setting, ICPs resulted in
improved patient experience and reduced need for hospitalization. Yet, a critical knowledge gap remains
regarding how to adapt and implement ICPs tested in the emergency department for inpatient care settings.
The overall objective of this K23 proposal is to use implementation strategies to adapt and preliminarily test an
ICP prototype specific for inpatient VOE care. In Aim 1, Dr. Jenkins will develop an ICP prototype adapted from
the emergency department setting for inpatient SCD care with a patient-inclusive multistakeholder team. In Aim
2, she will test the feasibility of implementing and evaluating ICPs for inpatient VOE care at both a community
and university-based hospital. Dr. Jenkins’s career development plan includes formal coursework, intensive
mentorship, and experiential training in 1) implementation research, 2) intervention adaptation, 3) delivering
high quality SCD inpatient care, and 4) the successful conduct of multisite collaborative research. Dr. Jenkins
will be supported by the extensive resources of the University of Rochester Medical Center and Clinical and
Translational Science Institute. She has also identified expert mentors in these disciplines with outstanding
track records in training independent investigators and securing protected time for this work. This award
addresses a significant gap in SCD and hospital-based research while affording the education and mentored
research experience critical to Dr. Jenkins and her career goal of becoming an independently funded
physician-scientist."
10932659,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Primary cilia are multisensory organelles that function as cellular antennae. We found that ciliary defects in
cholangiocytes and/or the loss of primary cilia are associated with biliary tract diseases like polycystic liver disease
(PLD) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). A better understanding of the signaling regulated by cilia and mechanisms
of ciliary loss in diseased cholangiocytes is critical to design new therapies based on the restoration of cilia, i.e.
ciliotherapies. Our current overall objective is to understand the role of cilia in the regulation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. EGFR signaling is abnormally persistent and enhanced in PLD and CCA, two
diseases with ciliary dysfunction. Furthermore, we aim to explore the mechanisms of ciliary loss in cholangiocytes
– especially how the autophagy machinery is targeted to resorption of this organelle. This proposal will assess how
cilia-autophagy communication works in cholangiocytes to reduce ciliary expression and, consequently, how the
loss or dysfunction of cilia enhances EGFR signaling. We propose that pathologically-induced ciliophagy
accounts for ciliary loss/dysfunction, inducing sustained EGFR signaling. We propose three Specific Aims:
In Specific Aim 1: To characterize molecular mechanisms of the ciliary-dependent degradation of activated EGFR,
we will assess the need of cilia for activated EGFR degradation; characterize the mechanisms of EGFR
translocation to primary cilia; and assess the hypothesis that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-CBL translocates to the
primary cilia upon EGF signaling and drives the degradation of activated EGFR located in the cilia. In Specific Aim
2: To identify the key players involved in targeting ciliary components to the autophagy machinery, we will assess
the role of autophagy and HDAC6/SIRT1 in ciliary expression in vitro; assess the role of HDAC6/SIRT1 in ciliophagy
in vivo; study the interaction between ciliary proteins and autophagy cargo receptors; and test the hypothesis that
in ciliary-defective cholangiocytes, overexpression of deacetylases induces lysine deacetylation of ciliary
components, which leads to ubiquitination of the same residues and targeting of the autophagy machinery by
specific autophagy cargo receptors. In Specific Aim 3: To test the combination of specific deacetylases,
autophagy, and EGFR inhibitors in pre-clinical rodent models as a therapeutic approach, we will assess the effect
of HDAC6 inhibition (Tubastatin-A or ACY-1215), and/or SIRT1 inhibition (Sirtinol) in combination with autophagy
inhibitors (e.g., HCQ, SAR405) with or without EGFR inhibition (Erlotinib, Afatinib) in vitro and in vivo; assess the
in vivo effects of Ciliomax (a novel dual inhibitor we recently developed) plus EGFR inhibition; and assess the most
promising treatments in patient-derived xenografts. Impact: identifying novel targets could lead to much-needed
new therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases. Our experiments in in vitro and pre-clinical rodent
models will characterize the ciliary-dependent regulation of EGFR and the communication between primary cilia
and the autophagy process, which will lay the foundation for potential clinical trials."

 Impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia
and a major source of patient and caregiver burden. Similarly to cognitive changes in AD, subtle difficulties in
IADL may begin even before the stage of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, greater emphasis
has been placed on preclinical AD, which consists of individuals with minimal or no symptoms but biological
marker evidence of AD pathology. As secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD are underway and the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) is providing new guidance for early-stage AD clinical trial outcome measures, it
is imperative that we develop new ecologically valid instruments to be able to track the emergence of subtle yet
clinically meaningful alterations in IADL. Older individuals are increasingly required to interact via the telephone,
computer, and most recently smartphone, to perform essential IADL, such as refilling prescriptions,
communicating with healthcare providers, and performing financial transactions. Most IADL tests do not use
everyday technology and are insufficiently validated. The goal of this project is to complete the development of,
optimize, and validate a novel performance-based IADL instrument that uses a smartphone to assess
healthcare-related daily activities, the Assessment of Smartphone Everyday Tasks (ASSET).
 For Phase 1, during Year 1 of the award, we will first develop 5 alternate versions of ASSET. We will then
recruit 20 cognitively normal young adults (YN), 20 cognitively normal older adults (CN), and 20 amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) participants at a single site, the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment
(CART) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Those 60 participants will undergo cognitive testing and
ASSET in the research clinic. The 60 participants will then undergo short-interval (2 weeks) test-retest
reliability of the 6 versions of ASSET (current version and 5 new alternate versions) remotely/at-home.
 For Phase 2, during Years 2 and 3 of the award, CART will serve as a coordinating center for 10 Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center (ADRC) sites, each of which will recruit 20 CN, 20 older adults with subjective cognitive
decline, and 10 MCI participants for a total of 500 participants. Those participants will undergo the Uniform Data
Set (UDS) neuropsychological testing battery as part of their ADRC annual visits, as well as the smartphone app
tasks, ASSET, and a subjective questionnaire at baseline and 1 year later, and in between remotely at home,
they will also perform ASSET on a monthly basis. Finally, AD pathology biomarker data (amyloid positron
emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid abeta positive/negative) available from other studies at the ADRC
performance sites will be analyzed in about half of participants."

Patients with locally invasive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have persistent minimal residual disease
(MRD) despite neoadjuvant therapy are at significant risks of developing lethal metastasis. This represents one of the
outstanding unmet needs in breast cancer therapy. A major cause of this high failure risk is the presence of rare, low-
proliferative disseminated tumor cells (lpDTCs), which are highly resistant to treatment. Many lpDTCs can persist in
distant organs for many years before reactivating to form metastasis. Attempts at eliminating lpDTCs in TNBC have
not been successful due to their rarity, making it difficult to isolate individual lpDTCs to identify therapeutic targets. To
that end, we report the identification and characterization of the IL-6, IL-6 receptor, and p38 (IL-6/R/p38) axis as a
critical signaling pathway required for the maintenance of a significant majority of lpDTCs in TNBC. In cultured human
TNBC cells and mouse models of TNBC, lpDTCs in the bone marrow (BM) can be forced out of quiescence simply by
inhibiting IL-6/R signaling. More importantly, once acutely reactivated, lpDTCs become exquisitely sensitive to
chemotherapy. Thus, the IL-6/R pathway is an attractive therapeutic target. In this proposal, we will test a novel
therapeutic strategy in a Phase I and II trial in patients with TNBC by specifically inhibiting the IL-6/R pathway to force
lpDTCs into proliferation, and then use conventional chemotherapy to eliminate these cells. First, we will determine
whether this treatment strategy is safe in patients in a standard dose finding Phase I study of sarilumab, an IL-6R
inhibiting antibody drug recently approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, sequentially combined with capecitabine, a
standard breast cancer chemotherapy drug, in patients with metastatic breast cancer (Aim 1). The Phase I’s
objectives are to determine tolerability and safety of the combination and the recommended dose of the combination
for the Phase II. Next, we will conduct a Phase II single-arm study using this recommended dose regimen in patients
with stage I-III TNBC who have persistent MRD in breast tissue or surrounding lymph nodes after neoadjuvant
therapy (Aim 2). The Phase II objectives are to determine how effective this drug combination is at clearing BM
lpDTCs, and if so whether patients cleared of BM lpDTCs have a higher rate of progression-free survival at two years
compared to patients historically treated with capecitabine alone. In Aim 3, we will isolate individual lpDTCs from BM
aspirates collected in this trial using the conventional magnet-based enrichment method and a locally developed
microfluidic device to 1) enumerate lpDTCs before and after treatment to determine the lpDTC clearing efficacy of the
test drug combination; and 2) to perform genomics analysis of single lpDTCs, primary and metastatic tumor samples
from the same patients. We will use a novel computational platform recently developed to analyze gene network
changes in response to treatment and tumor microenvironments that breast cancer cells transition during metastasis.
The goals are to 1) gain a deeper understanding of how lpDTCs are generated and maintained; and 2) yield additional
targets that can be combined with the IL-6/R pathway to improve DTC-targeting strategies in the near future."

Understanding how environmental factors trigger dysregulated immune responses was identified as a key challenge in preclinical research for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dysregulated responses to the luminal environment by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have been widely postulated to be a driver of IBD. On the other hand, the success of immunomodulatory biologics, such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab, clearly demonstrate the central role of T cells, especially pathogenic T cells, in IBD. However, it remains unclear how IECs convey innate immune detection at mucosal surfaces to adaptive immune responses and subsequent inflammation. Emerging at the center of this sensing function is the inflammasome, which can detect cellular stress and danger signals, such as ATP, found in injured tissues during chronic inflammation. In our quest to understand the role of the inflammasome in IECs, we found that IECs release large amounts of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) containing polyubiquitinated IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, in response to inflammasome activation in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Importantly, IEC-derived sEVs represent a novel form of communication between IECs and T cells. In particular, IL-18 promotes inflammatory pathogenic T cells via induction of IFN? and GM-CSF production. sEVs-derived from inflamed mouse colons exacerbate disease and confer resistance to anti-TNF treatment in a T cell transfer colitis model. Consistently, IECs from biopsies of inflamed areas from IBD patients displayed enhanced capacity to produce sEVs compared to that from non-inflamed areas. Thus, we hypothesize that IEC-derived sEVs play a critical role in IBD pathogenesis by amplifying epithelial inflammatory responses and promoting pathogenic T cells via the release of sEVs containing IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, and perhaps IL-33. This application seeks to determine the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie the release of sEVs and assess the importance of sEVs in promoting pathogenic T cells and anti-TNF therapy failure in murine models of colitis and in patient-derived specimens from IBD patients."
10932676,"Project Summary/Abstract
Regulatory T cell (Treg) immunosuppression is critical for maintaining immune tolerance to a diverse array of
potential antigens in the intestinal mucosa. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic intestinal
inflammation overwhelms local Treg function, allowing inflammation to persist. Our previous work and that of
others have identified important roles for 17β-estradiol (estrogen, E2) signaling in promoting Treg differentiation
and function. E2 signals through two nuclear receptors, alpha and beta (ERα, ERβ), to modulate gene
transcription in target cells. Although they share high sequence homology, ERα and ERβ mediate distinct and
often opposing functions on gene regulation. In previously published work, we showed that shifting the balance
of E2 signaling towards ERα is generally pro-inflammatory, whereas shifting towards ERβ is generally protective.
In recent preliminary studies using IBD patient samples, we observed significantly diminished ERβ expression
in intestinal biopsy tissues and peripheral T cells from females with active Crohn’s disease (CD). We also found
that ERβ-deficient T cells are resistant to ex vivo, TGFβ-dependent Treg differentiation, and that deletion of ERβ
in a spontaneous ileitis model (SAMP/YitFC, “SAMP” mice) results in significant impairment of Treg
transcriptional and functional responses, contributing to exacerbated inflammation. Therefore, the goal of this
project is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which altered E2 signaling impacts
Treg differentiation and function, contributing to intestinal inflammation. The mechanisms by which E2
signaling cross-talks with inflammatory signals to influence immune cell function are poorly understood. This
proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap through our central hypothesis that dysregulated E2 signaling
contributes to Treg transcriptional remodeling and loss-of-function, facilitating sustained intestinal
inflammation in IBD. In Aim 1, we propose to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which ERα- and ERβ
cross-talk with signaling downstream of TGFβ in primary T cells, influencing TGFβ-dependent Foxp3 expression
and function. Aim 2 will determine the functional impact of rebalancing Treg-specific E2 signaling on intestinal
inflammation in vivo, testing our hypothesis that augmenting Treg-specific ERβ signaling may prevent and/or
rescue intestinal inflammation. Experiments will include adoptive transfer of ERβ-expressing Tregs to SAMP
mice, as well as in vivo assays using a T cell-dependent colitis model. In Aim 3, we plan to determine the
transcriptional and functional effects of rebalancing E2 signaling in CD patient Tregs using novel MaxCyte
transfection technology, assessing ERα- and ERβ-specific effects on (i) TGFβ-dependent Foxp3 induction in
naïve T cells and (ii) ex vivo suppressive function of Tregs. Successful completion of our proposed Aims
will provide key mechanistic insight into the functional impact of E2 signaling in Tregs, an under-studied
area with broad applicability to numerous diseases exhibiting dysregulation of ER expression and/or
activation and subsequent reductions in Treg function."

Diminished early life environmental microbial exposures and perturbations to the infant gut microbiome are
related to asthma outcomes in childhood. Mexican populations resident in Nogales, Mexico exhibit a four-fold
decrease in childhood asthma rates compared with a population of comparable ancestry resident seventy miles
away across the border in Tucson, Arizona. Our preliminary data has demonstrated that these cross-border
populations experience significantly distinct microbial exposures in their environment (house dust and drinking
water) and that the stool microbiota of 1-month old infants raised in these environments are differentially enriched
for immunomodulatory bacterial genera. This suggests that microbial differentials in environmental and personal
microbiomes relate to the cross-border disparity in asthma rates observed in this population. BEAMS proposes
to comprehensively examine a population of Mexican mother-infant dyads resident in Nogales, Mexico or
Tucson, Arizona and their environment in early life to determine how differences in environmental, maternal and
infant microbial composition and function relate to asthma disparities in this cross-border population. Project 2
will examine at high-resolution the functional attributes of the microbiome of a subset of paired maternal prenatal
(vaginal and stool) and infant gut (longitudinally collected stool) samples collected from 200 mother-infant dyads,
as well as their paired house dust and water samples using shotgun metagenomics, RNA-Seq and
metabolomics. The study will examine functional differentials in inherited microbes and gut microbiome
development in cross-border communities that relate to T2 wheezing at age 2 years (a robust predictor of asthma
in later childhood) and immune development. These efforts aim to identify environmental, maternal and infant
microbiome attributes that promote protection against asthma within Mexican populations."

Lupus nephritis is the kidney manifestation of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE,
lupus); 10% of those afflicted progress to end stage kidney disease. Lupus nephritis kidneys are characterized
by a profound lymphocytic infiltrate and the degree of infiltrate, including B lymphocytes specifically, correlates
with tissue damage and disease severity. Kidneys are also characterized by axial concentration gradients of
sodium (Na+), up to 2-fold higher than serum. Thus the inimical kidney environment presents unique survival
challenges for infiltrating lymphocytes that may shape their phenotype and function. The function of intrarenal B
cells and the pathways they employ to adapt to the hostile kidney environment remain uncharacterized.
My preliminary data demonstrate that B cells from lupus-prone mice exhibit enhanced survival when exposed to
high Na+ ex vivo as compared to wildtype mice. This effect was mediated by high expression of sodium
potassium ATPase (Na+-K+-ATPase, NKA), a key regulator of cellular ionic balance. I have also shown that
kidney-infiltrating B cells in murine lupus adapted to elevated [Na+] and that the expression of in vivo NKA
correlated with the ability of infiltrating B cells to persist in the kidney. Pharmacological inhibition of NKA and
genetic knockout of the NKA g subunit, the latter not previously known to be expressed in B cells, resulted in
reduced kidney B cell infiltration and amelioration of proteinuria. B cells in renal biopsies of SLE patients also
expressed more NKA than intrarenal T cells, suggesting the same NKA-regulated B cell survival pathway is
operative in human SLE nephritis. How Na+ affects cell death pathways and whether it regulates B cell function,
such as antibody or cytokine production, is unknown. I hypothesize that Na+ modulates intrarenal B cell death
pathways and function, dissection of which will augment understanding of lupus nephritis pathogenesis. In Aim
1, I will investigate death pathways that lupus versus healthy control B cells undergo when exposed to high Na+
ex vivo. In Aim 2, I will assess B cell function upon alteration of kidney Na+ environment in mice while in Aim 3
I will utilize in situ imaging to define the functional landscape of these pathogenic cells in human SLE nephritis
biopsies. Together these studies will help identify kidney-specific targets for the treatment of SLE nephritis.

Sjögren’s Disease (SjD, previously known as Sjögren’s syndrome) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease
that causes significant morbidity. Experts estimate that 1.3 million individuals have SjD in the United States
alone. Previous research, particularly Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, has provided strong evidence
for low vitamin D as a risk factor contributing to several autoimmune conditions. Vitamin D is important for dozens
of biological processes. The gene transcription that occurs with the binding of vitamin D to vitamin D receptors
(VDRs) produces downstream effects implicated in immunomodulation, calcium metabolism, cellular growth,
proliferation and apoptosis, and other important immunologic functions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with genetic variation in VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) have been previously identified in
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); these VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with several
autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, depression, and cancer. To date, available
research on vitamin D in SjD has been limited to small studies of serum vitamin D levels in SjD cases and
controls which observed lower vitamin D levels in cases. There have been no published studies investigating:
1) low vitamin D as a risk factor for SjD using MR analysis, or 2) genetic variation within individual VDR binding
sites as a risk factor for SjD. VDR-BVs are therefore strong candidates to investigate for their genetic contribution
to SjD. The overall objective of this F31 application is to identify VDR-BVs across the genome and
characterize their association with SjD susceptibility, severity, and related clinical outcomes. We
hypothesize that altered VDR binding disrupts downstream gene regulation by vitamin D and increases the risk
of developing SjD or results in more severe disease. Our approach will use an assembled dataset with more
than 1,500 SjD cases and 27,000 controls (for which the data are already available) matched on race/ethnicity,
with whole genome SNP profiles and demographic and clinical data from the Sjögren’s International
Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) registry. For this project, we will use VDR-BVs previously identified
through ChIP-seq analysis in LCLs and conduct subsequent analyses in primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The
proposed study will: 1) Identify VDR binding sites through ChIP-exo analysis in primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
using the SICCA cases and controls; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs and vitamin D-related SNPs
and SjD susceptibility among SICCA study subjects using MR methods; and 3) Estimate the association between
VDR-BVs and vitamin D-related SNPs and clinical SjD phenotypes among SICCA study subjects using MR
methods. Results from the proposed aims will identify genetic risk factors for SjD related to vitamin D
and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of SjD. Ultimately, the goal
of this work is to understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune-mediated disease."

HD MSNs manifest developmental alterations that cause their dysfunction, dedifferentiation and potentially
dysregulation with inappropriate neuronal markers for MSNs. We further hypothesize that these HD phenotypes
can be corrected by modulating MSN developmental transcription factors or via drugs that correct transcriptional
dysregulation. Specifically, the failure of HD MSNs to differentiate properly makes them more susceptible to
neurodegeneration. Therefore, we can use our newly discovered MSN transcription factors to rescue this HD
phenotype. The early developmental alterations in MSNs set the stage for developing HD symptoms later in
life. In support of this hypothesis: 1) the maturation or maintenance of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is
dysregulated in human isogenic HD-iPSCs with corrected alleles; 2) that the developmental trajectory is distinct
and alters the DLX gene family, key MSN developmental transcription factors, as determined by bulk and
scRNAseq; 3) using bioinformatics, drugs can be identified that can be repurposed to rescue this altered
developmental trajectory; 4) the key developmental MSN transcription factor, Bcl11b (also known as Ctip2), is
also a key maintenance factor in the mature MSNs, as conditional and specific deletion in postnatal mouse
MSNs converts their transcriptome to one that mimics human and mouse HD gene expression and 5)
identification of novel TFs required for striatal compartmentation and striosome maturation may be potential HD
therapeutic targets. Therefore, the specific aims are: Specific Aim 1 will characterize the cellular,
developmental and functional deficits in human isogenic HD-MSNs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells,
and evaluate if predicted key TFs or drugs rescue HD phenotypes; Specific Aim 2 will characterize the cellular,
developmental and functional deficits in isogenic human HD-organoids (structural organization and diversity of
cells) and evaluate if predicted key TFs or drugs rescue HD phenotypes. Specific Aim 3 will determine if
overexpression of MSN TFs corrects abnormalities in the Q175 mouse model with focus on the striosomal
compartment. These studies will advance our understanding of how to model HD in striatal MSNs/organoids
and identify novel mechanistic pathways and therapeutic targets for HD."

Alcohol use is associated with both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects; however, cellular and
molecular mechanisms or therapeutic interventions to normalize immune disturbances caused by alcohol are
yet to be explored. Increased pro-inflammatory responses in the monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil
populations are complicated by immune exhaustion leading to poor clinical outcomes in alcohol-associated
hepatitis (AH). Recent studies described “trained immunity” that is characterized by long-term epigenetic
reprogramming of innate immune cells by an infection or host factors such as, potentially, alcohol use. Our
preliminary data suggest that alcohol induces features of “trained immunity” that is characterized by enhanced
pro-inflammatory responses to subsequent insults. Thus, we hypothesize that chronic and/or binge alcohol use
result in trained immunity in monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils and this contributes to exacerbated
inflammatory responses in AH. Emerging evidence suggests that trained immunity is a result of
immunometabolic and epigenetic programming of innate immune cells including bone marrow precursors.
Consistent with this, we found increased utilization of glycolysis as opposed to OXPHOX in PBMCs of patients
with AH. Thus, we hypothesize that alcohol-induced trained immunity is mediated by immunometabolic
reprogramming. Our preliminary results also show altered metabolic profile in mice, specifically when challenged
with LPS. We postulate that by identifying key alcohol-induced immunometabolic and epigenetic events, we can
design targets for reversal of dysregulated innate immunity in AH. Our Aims are #1: To investigate the effects of
alcohol use on features of trained immunity in mouse models and in human alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) by
a) Evaluating “trained immunity” in bone marrow granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (BM-GMP) and in liver
neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages (Mo/Mφ) in alcohol “trained mice” after an LPS challenge; b) Identifying
epigenetic features of trained immunity in liver neutrophil and Mo/Mφ populations and BM-GMP by
snRNA+scATAC seq, and determine specific gene activation/repression marks by ChIP-qPCR; c) Characterizing
the phenotypic and epigenetic signature of “trained immunity” in circulating neutrophil and Mo/Mφ populations in
AH patients. #2: To identify the immunometabolic signature in “alcohol trained” mice after an LPS challenge and
in humans with AH; and #3: To evaluate underlying mechanisms by which alcohol induces metabolic
reprogramming and trained immunity by a) Assessing the role of the cellular energy sensor “PAS Kinase” in in
vivo models of alcohol-induced trained immunity in mice; b) Restoring immune cell functionality by modulating
specific immunometabolic receptors (SUCNR1, OXGR1), and immune checkpoint receptors (PD-1); c) Targeting
key epigenetic regulators (HDAC9) in restoration of alcohol-induced trained immunity. Results from this proposal
will provide novel insights into alcohol-induced immunometabolic and epigenetic alterations that can lead to
“trained immunity” and thereby derail immune responses even after stopping alcohol use."
10905323,"Project Summary
Congenital hearing loss affects about 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the USA. Many genes associated
with congenital deafness encode proteins that are essential for formation of the actin-based
mechanosensory stereocilia in the inner ear hair cells. A number of molecules responsible for growth of
stereocilia and establishing their perfect staircase-like arrangement within a hair bundle have been identified.
However, less is known about the proteins shaping the base of stereocilia. Yet, this is exactly the point,
around which the rod-like stiff stereocilium rotates during sound-induced vibrations. Therefore, the
molecules located at stereocilia base determine both the mechanical properties of the hair bundle (and
hence its overall sensitivity) and its susceptibility to excessive deflections (acoustic trauma). Only in the last
two decades, we and others identified TRIOBP4/5, Fam65b/RIPOR2, and taperin (TPRN) as the proteins
essential for formation of the rootlets of the auditory hair cell stereocilia, shaping stereocilia “taper”, and
determining mechanical properties of the hair bundle. Here, we propose a central hypothesis that, in
addition to the already known distinct actin compartments inside stereocilium - at the very tip (stereocilia
growth), shaft (widening and stiffening), and rootlets (resilient deflections) - there is a distinct compartment
of F-actin that is cross-linked by TPRN at the base of stereocilium. This compartment anchors mechanically
the rootlet and prevents pulling the stereocilium out of cuticular plate. It also controls disassembly of
supernumerary stereocilia during postnatal development. This central hypothesis is well supported by our
preliminary data. We have found that TPRN crosslinks actin filaments in vitro and disrupts stereocilia actin
core when overexpressed in vivo. We have also identified interacting partners of TPRN that form protein
complex at the base of stereocilia. We have generated several mouse models with genomic truncations or
deletions in Tprn gene, including deletion that does not disrupt F-actin crosslinking in vitro. Preliminary
studies revealed structural and functional abnormalities in the auditory hair cell stereocilia of these mice. To
test our hypotheses further, we will: i) determine how exactly TPRN organizes F-actin in vitro; ii) determine
the effects of taperin deficiency on stereocilia F-actin in vivo; iii) elucidate the effects of TPRN deficiency on
mechanical properties of stereocilia bundles; and iv) determine how TPRN-based complex affects normal
disassembly of supernumerary stereocilia in postnatal development. Overall, our study will elucidate the
molecular machinery that shapes stereocilia at their base, thereby determining their optimal mechanical
properties that are essential for normal hearing."
10905422,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major source of morbidity in renal transplantation (Tx), as well as after cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, and trauma. IRI and related early allograft dysfunction occur in ~30% of renal Tx recipients and are associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Kidney scarcity has also led to acceptance of grafts with greater degrees of baseline ischemic insult. These factors help explain why short-term graft survival has steadily improved in conjunction with the development of better immunosuppression but why long-term graft survival has been unchanged for nearly 2 decades.
Our central goal is to develop ways to limit renal IRI and preserve renal function following renal Tx and other clinical scenarios. This proposal builds on our work in murine models showing that estrogen therapy preserves renal function and mitigates development of fibrosis after warm or cold renal IRI. We found that estrogen’s actions via estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) are renal-extrinsic, whereas actions of estrogen receptor-beta (ER) may diminish the benefits of estrogen therapy on renal IRI and are renal-intrinsic. We plan to further explore these actions, with an eye to improving clinical outcomes.
Aim 1. Assess the cells/tissues responsible for the differential effects of ER and ER on renal IRI. Whole animal ER deletion leads to decreased renal IRI tolerance, and in Tx experiments, renal ER deletion does not impact IRI tolerance whereas deletion in the recipient dramatically worsens IRI. In contrast, whole animal ER deletion leads to increased renal IRI tolerance, and in Tx experiments, ER deletion in the renal Tx promotes IRI tolerance whereas deletion in the recipient has no benefit on IRI. Using cellular, biochemical, and transcriptomic studies, we will assess various cell lineages for their contribution to the opposite effects of 1.1) ER and 1.2) ER deletion on renal IRI.
Aim 2. Probe the utility of SERMs and related compounds to modulate outcomes of renal IRI. We have tested various SERMs for their impact on IRI in mice and shown that raloxifene, a clinically approved osteoporosis drug, is superior to estrogen in promoting renal protection, while several other SERMs have no impact on renal IRI. Using murine models of renal IRI we will test whether: 2.1) ER antagonists, or 2.2) a SERM, such as raloxifene, in combination with an ER antagonist can maximize beneficial effects against renal IRI.
Our studies will identify pathogenetic mechanisms and test new approaches to prevent acute and chronic kidney injury with significant potential for translational intervention."

My long-term goal is to be a clinical-translational research scientist focused on developing effective therapies
for patients with cardiovascular disease. My background in the development and physiology of adipose tissue
as well as clinical training in cardiovascular medicine have motivated me to better understand the molecular
mechanisms by which epicardial adipocytes influence the development of atrial fibrillation. I propose to conduct
a prospective clinical investigation to test the hypothesis that adipocytes are recruiting myeloid cells to the
myocardium to increase vulnerability for postoperative AF. The specific aims of my proposal are:
Aim 1. Characterize transcriptomic profiles of epicardial adipocytes and determine circulating levels of
adipose-derived chemokines
Aim 2. Determine the relationship between inflammation in epicardial adipose tissue and left atrial function as
assessed by echocardiographic parameters, including left atrial volume index, left atrial function index and left
atrial mechanical dispersion.
Aim 3. Examine the relationship between inflammation in epicardial adipose tissue and incident postoperative
AF after coronary artery bypass graft surgery
I am seeking a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award from the National Heart Lung and
Blood Institute allow me the opportunities to expand my skills in clinical research methodologies, bioinformatics
and biostatistics and enable me to be a translational scientist. The training plan in this proposal takes
advantage of coursework and a strong mentoring team (Drs. McManus, Fitzgerald, and Corvera) with broad
expertise (atrial fibrillation, innate immunity, adipocyte biology and clinical research methodologies) to fill key
gaps in my previous training to advance my career goals. This proposal is among the first to explore the
mechanism by which myeloid cells are recruited to the myocardium. This work will provide novel insights into
the association between epicardial adipose tissue, inflammation and postoperative AF. The recruitment of
inflammatory cells is key to the subsequent immune-mediated dysregulation of the electrical properties in
cardiomyocytes and the downstream fibrotic processes. Understanding the molecular mediators of
inflammation will identify new treatments for postoperative AF."
10908604,"Project Summary / Abstract
Population dynamics are central to many pressing problems in biomedicine. Whether we look at
epidemics, microbiome, or cancer, we need to understand how populations grow, spread, and
evolve. The outcome of these processes is largely controlled by ecological and genetic diversity
of the population. Moreover, the patterns of diversity are often the only available cues about the
factors that drive population dynamics. Although a lot of effort went into characterizing the
diversity of stationary populations (both well-mixed and spatially structured) the understanding of
evolutionary processes in growing populations is much more limited. Our recent work found that
seemingly innocuous changes in the growth dynamics can fundamentally alter how populations
evolve during spatial expansions. To understand such phenomena, we developed powerful
theoretical tools, which lead to the discovery of hidden universality classes in the standard
reaction-diffusion models of population genetics. Preliminary data strongly supports the
hypothesis that each universality class has a unique structure of genealogies. Moreover, neutral
evolution in some spatially expanding populations seems to produce genealogies identical to
those in rapidly-adapting well-mixed populations, which suggests that some common signatures
of selection need to be revisited. The first aim is to develop this theory further and test it in
numerical simulations. The second aim is to examine how the universal behavior of genealogies
is affected by common biophysical process, which are neglected in standard one-component
reaction-diffusion models. Specifically, we will extend our theory of evolutionary dynamics to
include the influence of mechanical pressure, nutrient diffusion, and movement in response to
environmental gradients. The third aim is focused on establishing a connection between genetic
diversity and growth instabilities that produce typical population morphologies. Taken together,
these lines of research will lay the groundwork to interpret spatially-resolved genetic data and use
it to predict and control the course of evolution. Such capabilities are essential for our fight against
cancer, antibiotic resistance, and epidemics. The mathematical innovations developed in the
course of this work should also be useful across a wide set of applications because reaction-
diffusion models find numerous uses in chemistry, biology, and medicine."

10939834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More people will die from bacterial infections than cancer by the year 2050. Gram-negative (G–) pathogens are
largely responsible for the world’s nosocomial infections. They are more difficult to treat than Gram-positive
(G+) pathogens due to an outer membrane (OM) and OM efflux pumps that aid resistance against antibiotics
that would otherwise be effective. As a result, the arsenal of G– therapies could be expanded if G+ antibiotics
are repurposed to overcome these barriers. As more infections emerge that are resistant to all current
therapies, innovation in this area is direly needed. Siderophore-antibiotic conjugates (SACs) are touted as one
strategy for repurposing G+ antibiotics for G– bacteria. However only one marketed drug has resulted from two
decades or research. A major limitation of protease-activated prodrugs is that linkers are traditionally designed
to target one or two proteases. I developed a substrate phage platform that led to the first peptide linkers that
targeted bacterial proteases for prodrug release, which addressed challenges to cleavable linker development.
The platform was then expanded to enable identification of linkers with desired stability in host
microenvironments and cleavage selectivity in a broad range of pathogens. Incorporation of these linkers into
multifunctional siderophore delivery systems will enable us to overcome current limitations of existing cleavable
siderophore-antibiotic conjugates (SACs) and successfully repurpose G+ antibiotics for G– bacteria. Our goal
is to eventually develop more G– antibiotics, which is outside the scope of this application. To achieve this
goal, the challenging problem of cleavable linker selectivity must be addressed. To tackle these challenges, my
lab will work to: 1) discover selective cleavable peptide prodrug linkers (e.g., high serum stability and controlled
linker cleavage inside a broad range of pathogens); 2) develop multifunctional siderophore-delivery systems;
and 3) demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of conjugate systems containing these linkers in animal models for
treating diverse multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Our approach is not to develop a new antibiotic drug,
but instead is focused on development of selective cleavable linkers, which have not been successfully
developed for siderophore-delivery systems. The ultimate goal of our linker discovery program will be to
expand the platform to improve prodrugs for multiple diseases. My lab will continue to develop the linker
discovery platform, design new delivery systems, and study their properties in bacteria and in cell lines.
Together with our collaborators, we will integrate our expertise in synthesis, chemical biology, microbiology,
animal models, and genetic code expansion to improve cleavable prodrug delivery systems."
10940564,"The concept of this program derives from our observations that the involution of the human thymus does
not follow linear kinetics and is tailored to each individual. In most humans, the involution process
gradually shuts down the thymic T cell output until about the age of fifty. Still, in some cases, the structure
and function of this primary lymphatic organ are preserved in elderly subjects until they are about 100
years old. Our research plan asks how often we can find a functional thymus in the elderly, and we
propose a qualitative and quantitative study of the thymic structure using cadavers in the Gross Anatomy
course at KYCOM. Applying immunohistochemistry techniques, we will determine the degree of thymic
involution and rank it by preserving the thymic epithelial space, the symmetry of the involution in both
thymic lobes, and the presence of the T cells. To determine whether the thymus was functional at the
time of death, we will apply molecular biology techniques to amplify the FoxN1 mRNA in thymic tissue
and TREC (T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles) DNA in the splenocytes. Based on preliminary
data, we expect to find four stages of thymic involution in elderly: (i) functional thymus with active
thymopoiesis [TEC+/CD3+/FoxN1+/TREC+], (ii) functional thymus with no thymopoiesis [TEC+/CD3-
/FoxN1+/TREC-], (iii) structural thymic support with no thymopoiesis and no FoxN1 activity [TEC+/CD3-
/FoxN1-/TREC-], and, (iv) silent, involuted thymus [TEC-/CD3-/FoxN1-/TREC-]. We shall apply descriptive
statistics to find the central tendency or a typical element of the preserved thymic function in our sample
in the context of the donor’s age and COD. We will apply inferential statistics to establish relationships
between characteristics within the data sample. If we detect the functional thymus, we will correlate it
with the degree of the structural preservation of the organ and the cause of death (COD). In the long-
term plan, we will apply the results generated from this application to predict the longevity of the immune
system based on markers of the thymic function established in this study. This research proposal serves
two functions: (1) to meet the research goals, and (2) through this REAP funding mechanism, to provide
the Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine students much-needed exposure to basic biomedical
research. To ensure the feasibility of the proposed work, we formed an interdisciplinary team of experts

10940618,"Deciphering the Stepwise Regulatory Mechanisms of Genome Folding
In multicellular organisms, the precise regulation of gene expression across the different cell types and
developmental stages is achieved through the orchestration of cis-regulatory elements, notably enhancers.
These elements are positioned distantly from gene promoters and exert their function by establishing physical
interactions with them. Crucially, these interactions depend on the three-dimensional folding of the genome. Any
disruptions to this highly orchestrated genome folding, which can give rise to dysregulated gene expression,
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a myriad of diseases, including cancer and developmental
disorders. Hence, unraveling the mechanisms that govern genome folding becomes a paramount endeavor in
order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the precise control of gene expression, both in healthy
physiological contexts and in the aberrant states associated with disease. Over the last two decades, significant
advancements in genomic studies employing proximity-ligation and sequencing techniques have revealed the
cohesin complex as a key driver of genome folding. Recent groundbreaking single-molecule imaging
experiments have demonstrated cohesin's motor activity, directly engaging in loop extrusion to fold linear DNA
in vitro. However, it has been largely elusive how cohesin-mediated genome folding is regulated in the living
cells. To answer this question, we will focus on three research topics: 1. How do nuclear bodies influence cohesin
function? 2. What are the post-translational modifications (PTMs) on cohesin-associated factors and their impact
on genome folding? 3. What are the cytosolic signals that regulate genome folding through cohesin and how do
they do so? Cohesin-mediated genome folding is achieved through highly dynamic processes of cohesin
loading/loop extrusion, extrusion stalling, and cohesin unloading. We will dissect and pinpoint the specific
process within the genome folding that are regulated by nuclear bodies, PTMs and cytosolic signals. Collectively,
our proposed studies aim to unveil novel molecular mechanisms governing genome folding, providing a
comprehensive understanding of how genome folding is regulated in living cells and its contribution to disease
states."
10940689,"SUMMARY
The molecular basis by which a new function emerges in evolution sets the mechanisms by which
it can break down – ultimately contributing to disease. Unfortunately, our understanding of the
genetic, molecular, and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the origins of new functions is
limited because most functions evolved only once in the distant past and have been modified by
subsequent evolutionary processes. In particular, changes in gene regulation are a common route
by which new molecular functions occur, account for much of the variation in complex traits, and
play important roles in human health and disease. However, fundamental questions about the
evolution of gene regulation remain unknown. First, we often do not know the genes responsible
for regulatory changes. This is in large part because we lack systems and tools where the genetic
basis of regulatory differences can be determined between species. Second, while transcription
factors play key roles in gene regulation and changes in them can be sources of disease, we lack
approaches for determining whether they play key roles in the evolution of gene regulation.
Furthermore, if transcription factors are important sources of regulatory variation, the molecular
mechanisms by which pleiotropic consequences are avoided are poorly understood. Third, correct
gene regulation is essential, yet differences in regulation are quite common. Despite this, the rate
of regulatory change and the evolutionary mechanisms responsible are not known because we
lack systems where these can be dissected into the individual molecular changes that occurred.
Over the next five years, my research group will address these knowledge gaps using high-
throughput approaches in the Saccharomyces yeast. Despite being as genetically distinct as
humans and birds, species in the Saccharomyces genus naturally produce viable hybrids and can
be genetically crossed after precise genome engineering. We will use this ability to develop a
system for mapping the genetic basis of regulatory differences on long evolutionary timescales.
This will reveal common genetic sources of regulatory divergence, as well as the broad molecular
basis by which regulatory evolution occurs. Saccharomyces yeast also contain all common
mechanisms of transcription factor binding found among eukaryotes. We will develop high-
throughput and unbiased approaches for determining how important changes in these
transcription factors have been in regulatory evolution. Finally, we will determine the rate of
regulatory change and the molecular basis for compensatory changes in gene regulation. The
long-term goal of this work is to improve our understanding of how gene regulation functions and
evolves to improve our ability to predict the effects of regulatory variation in health and disease."

other individual projects/cores as deemed relevant to the Core’s Objectives and Specific Aims, and 2) coordination
of the Directors with other U19 U19 investigators. The quality of the Core services will be measured and continuously
improved upon user feedback, self-review/evaluation, and independent evaluation and recommendations from the
In-/Ex-ternal Advisory Boards, if necessary."
10913428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Clinical Core is located at Tulane University School of Medicine (SOM). The overall objective of the Core is to
recruit 300 human subjects, including 150 subjects with hip osteoporotic fracture (OF) and 150 controls without
OF, for Projects 1-3 during the first 4 years. All the case and control subjects are at least 55 years old. The
control subjects will be closely matched with hip OF cases for age, sex, weight, and ethnicity.
Recruitment plan: Recruitment of the 150 subjects with new hip OF (75 men and 75 women in each group) will
occur at Tulane Health System (THS). THS consists of three major Tulane SOM affiliated hospitals and an additional
25 medical clinics in the greater New Orleans area. Per our system records, THS treats >120 hip OF patients with
age ≥ 55 years old in recent years. Study clinicians will identify new hip OF patients who are ≥55 years in age and
have a unilateral hip fracture (with the other side normal) and will refer them for participation in the proposed study.
The control subjects will be recruited from our ongoing large-scale Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS). Currently,
LOS has >5,500 subjects (age ≥55 years) without any fracture history. Most of them (>95%) signed informed consent
forms to allow re-contact for future research opportunities. For the recruited hip OF subjects, we will screen for
potentially matched control subjects through the ongoing LOS recruitment and the extensive LOS archive.
For all the case and control subjects who are willing to participate, we will confirm their eligibility, consent subjects,
perform clinical examination, and collect specimens.
Steps in clinical examination and specimen collection: For all consented eligible case and control subjects, we
will collect their epidemiological information by three questionnaires. We will conduct DXA (dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry) scan at spine, hip, and whole body, to derive bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score
(TBS), and perform QCT scan at spine and hip for vBMD/finite element analyses (FEA).
For each subject, we will collect 50ml fasting blood (for Proj 1-3), 10ml urine (for biobanking), and ~0.5g stool (for Proj
1) samples. For each subject, we will also collect bone samples by bone biopsy at os ilium for isolation of osteoblasts,
and 10ml bone marrow samples by bone marrow aspiration for isolation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(BMSCs) for Project 2. All the collected specimens will be immediately transferred for subsequent processing (e.g.,
stool DNA extraction, plasma preparation, bone cell isolation) in Projects 1-3, respectively.
The PI’s group has had a long history of successful recruitment for clinical and epidemiological studies. The
services provided by this Core are routine in our Tulane Center for Biomedical Informatics and Genomics (CBG)
and have been successful for all of our previous and ongoing NIH projects (e.g., P50AR055081, R01AR050496,
R01AR064421, R01AR059781, and U19AG055373)."
10913430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this U19 Program Project (U19) is to comprehensively identify osteoporosis risk genes/bacterial
species and their functional products from the human genome and gut microbiome. We will characterize their functions
through comprehensive trans-omics integrative analyses of the data generated both from this renewal project and
from our ongoing U19 (U19 AG055373, 9/15/2017-). This program involves extensive data management and complex
analyses, requiring organic and simultaneous consideration of data from multiple component projects and demanding
powerful and innovative analysis methodology. Thus, a Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core (BBC) is necessary
focusing on the use of both existing and the development of novel, integrative analysis approaches.
The Objective of the BBC is to serve as a backbone support core for experimental design refinement, data quality
control, management, imputation, integration, and interpretation, and to serve as a synergizer to foster data and
information exchange and collaboration across individual projects/cores within the U19. Built upon the Core members’
long-term productive collaborations, the BBC will provide services through the following Specific Aims:
1) To deliver efficient support and services for data management, including high-quality data entry and database
management, query and maintenance, data quality control, safety, monitoring, sharing, etc.
2) To provide strong support for and conduct extensive biostatistics and bioinformatics, especially multi- and trans-
omics data imputation and integrative analyses. Closely working with the U19 investigators, the BBC will support both
single-level omics data analyses and integrative analyses of multi-level omics data. Particularly, the BBC will pioneer
a sophisticated integrative analysis strategy. This highly innovative strategy will link gut microbiome DNA, human host
DNA, miRNA, methylation, and metabolomic data anchored via gene-based mRNA hubs to construct unified functional
multi-omics modules and regulatory networks/pathways for both osteoblastogenic and osteoclastogenic lineage cells.
These re-constructed functional modules and regulatory networks/pathways will then be used in disease
association/causality analyses for osteoporosis risk.
3) To evaluate, validate, and apply novel, robust and powerful integrative analysis methods for the identification and
characterization of (epi-)genes and variants, gut microbiome bacterial species, and gene/pathway functions for
osteoporosis. The novel methods developed in-house (e.g., through recent R01’s funded to Core Director – Dr. Wang)
under rigorous statistical frameworks, together with those developed by other groups in the field, will be comparatively
used. These methods will characterize and incorporate crosstalks/interactions among-omics, along with prior
biological information, to study causal relationships between multi-omics data and diseases. The innovative methods
will be applied to, and empirically tested in, the multi-omics data obtained from and those available to this U19.
The BBC will be an efficient, capable, and powerful core component, serving all U19 projects and the overall goal of
this U19 that intends to integrate the individual project results."
10913432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is the most prevalent aging metabolic bone disease, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD)
and an increased risk of low trauma osteoporotic fractures (OF). BMD and OF share some—but not all—of their
genetic determinants. Animal studies have indicated an important role of gut microbiota in bone. Germ-free mice
exhibited increased bone mass with a reduced number of osteoclasts; colonization of these mice with a normal gut
microbiota normalized bone mass. Human studies have suggested an association of gut microbiota diversity with
osteoporosis, all with small samples. Direct solid evidence of the significance/mechanisms of gut microbiota for
osteoporosis has not been obtained, and the mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with the
human genome to impact bone metabolism through oteoblasto-/osteoclasto-genic lineages remain unknown.
In Project 1, we propose to conduct a large-scale, comprehensive gut metagenome-wide association study to gain
fundamental insights into gut microbial composition/function/impact for osteoporosis. Our Goal is to identify/validate
significant gut microbial signatures (at both taxonomic and functional levels) underlying osteoporosis risk, including
those shared by-or specific to-BMD and/or OF. Further, we will use both bioinformatic and experimental approaches
to investigate causal effects and underlying mechanisms of selected bacterial species on bone metabolism.
We will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) We will leverage the extensive data and sample archive from
our current U19 project and Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) to identify and validate metagenomic signatures
(microbial species and pathways) significantly associated with BMD, bone microarchitecture (assessed by
trabecular bone score, TBS) and quality (assessed by QCT/finite element analyses) in >5,000 subjects. We will
explore potential effects of sex and ethnicity on metagenomic profiles and their association outcomes. 2) We will
perform a metagenome-wide association study in 150 subjects with OF and 150 healthy controls (age ≥55) to
identify specific microbial species and pathways significantly and intrinsically associated with OF. 3) By cross-
referencing the results from Aims 1-2, we will identify significant metagenomic signatures that are unique to–or
shared by—BMD/TBS/bone quality and OF. 4) For selected significant bacterial species, we will assess their
potential causal effects and underlying mechanisms on BMD and OF by both computational analyses and functional
studies in aged mouse models. The data derived from this project will be further integrated (in Core C) with other
omics profiles from Projects 2-3 for a comprehensive trans-omics dissection of the molecular (epi-)genetic
mechanisms underlying osteoporosis.
This project promises to shed light on the significance of the human gut microbiome to osteoporosis, and reveal
novel pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. The findings will be essential for developing novel gut
microbiota-based approaches for clinical prediction (based on metagenomic markers) and intervention (based on
novel gut pro/pre/syn-biotics) to help alleviate the risk of osteoporosis."
10913434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is the most prevalent metabolic bone disease during aging, characterized by low bone mineral density
(BMD); deteriorated bone quality/strength/microarchitecture (measured by finite element analyses [FEA] and
trabecular bone score [TBS]); and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures (OFs). While studies of osteoporosis have
focused on BMD, the mechanisms of the disease, especially in vivo in humans and for OFs in particular, remain
unclear. Omics studies of OFs are rare but necessary given that BMD and OFs share only ~50% of genetic
determination. Joint omics studies of OF and bone risk factors (BMD/FEA/TBS) are imperative to identify mechanisms
that are both relevant to OFs and amenable for intervention from the aspect of bone metabolism.
Bone metabolism is mainly influenced by cells in osteoblastogenic (e.g., bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
[BMSCs], osteoblasts, osteocytes), and osteoclastogenic (e.g., monocytes, osteoclasts) lineages. These classical cell
types can be further classified into subtypes with differential biological functions. To date, functional omics studies of
osteoporosis—on bone biopsies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes (PBMs – potential)
(precursors of osteoclasts)—have been largely performed without distinguishing between cell (sub)types and without
considering cell composition (CC), hence, may yield false-positive/negative results.
In Project 2, our Goal is to conduct an innovative and comprehensive single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)-
based trans-omics study of osteoporosis in vivo in humans on both osteoblastogenic and osteroclastogenic lineages.
Our Hypothesis is that traditional bone lineage cells, composed of functionally distinct cell subtypes, have differential
genes and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that, together with cell–cell interactions (CCIs) and individual CCs, are
significant for osteoporosis. This will be tested through the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify/discover functionally
distinct cell subtypes, their corresponding marker genes and GRNs and explore their developmental
relationships/trajectories using scRNA-seq on freshly isolated bone, bone marrow, and PBMs obtained from 150
subjects with OFs and 150 matched (including matching for age) controls (age ≥ 55; recruited through Clinical Core
[Core B]). Significant differences in transcriptomic profiles, GRNs, CCs and CCIs will be determined between OF
cases and controls. The effects of age, sex, ethnicity, and other covariates will be assessed/adjusted throughout. 2)
With the sc-seq data collected in Aim 1 as reference, use innovative multi-omics approaches to impute sc-
transcriptomic profiles in >5,300 subjects that have been characterized both phenotypically and by various omics
through our ongoing U19 and Louisiana Osteoporosis Study; PBM methylome data from these subjects will also be
used as reference to impute epigenomic data in the 300 participants recruited through Core B. 3) Identify and validate
transcriptomic/epigenomic profiles, CCs, GRNs, and CCIs that are commonly or specifically significant for
BMD/FEA/TBS and/or OFs by integrating and comparing results from Aims 1 & 2.
This project is the first such comprehensive innovative pioneering study of in vivo mechanisms of OF and its bone risk
factors in humans. The resultant data will serve as invaluable public resources for research of various diseases."
10913437,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease related to aging, with significant sex/ethnic/population
differences in its risk. It is mainly characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), deteriorated bone quality/strength,
and subsequent increased risk to low-trauma osteoporotic fractures (OF). Our current pathophysiological knowledge
and diagnostic tools for osteoporosis are limited, and available medication is not satisfactory. New
prediction/diagnosis/treatment methods developed from novel biomarkers/pathways/targets are much needed.
Metabolomics offers systematic profiling of metabolites, revealing molecular variation closest to the disease risk and
phenotype. Biomarker discoveries and the corresponding biological insights gained from metabolomics studies have
improved our understanding of many disorders. However, metabolomics studies for osteoporosis, especially in
humans remain scarce, leaving many knowledge gaps to be filled. Current gaps include: 1) no metabolomics studies
for osteoporosis in elderly US populations; 2) no sex/ethnicity-difference examinations; 3) no metabolomics studies
for OF per se; 4) no chemical structural determination and validation for unknown metabolites detected in the studies
which used untargeted metabolomics approaches; and 5) no functional validation of identified osteoporosis-related
metabolites. The Overall Goal of Project 3 is to systematically discover metabolomic profiles associated with BMD
and/or OF in US populations, including both Caucasians and African Americans. We will use state-of-the-art
untargeted/global and targeted metabolomics (e.g., lipidolomics and short chain fatty acids) approaches, maximizing
the coverage of detectable metabolites. The osteoporosis/OF-related metabolites that are detected by the untargeted
approach will go through structural validation for known metabolites using standard compounds, and structural
determination for unknown metabolites as well as absolute quantification for evaluating their true effects. The Specific
Aims are: Aim 1) To identify metabolites associated with BMD (including areal BMD and volumetric BMD) and bone
quality traits (finite element analyses based on QCT and TBS based on DXA) in > 5,300 subjects from our current
U19 project and the Louisiana Osteoporosis Study; Aim 2) To identify metabolites associated with OF in 150 subjects
with OF and 150 controls who will be recruited through Core B; Aim 3) To identify metabolomic profiles that are
specific to—or shared by—BMD and OF by comparing the results from Aims 1 and 2, and identify causal metabolites
for BMD and OF using Mendelian Randomization approach; Aim 4) To conduct in vitro (e.g., effects on differentiation
of osteoblasts and osteoclasts) and in vivo (e.g., effects on bone traits in aged mice) functional validation of causal
metabolites associated with both osteoposoris and OF. This project promises to yield insights into the significance of
the human metabolome to osteoporosis and OF risk, and reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms and powerful
tools for diagnosis/prognosis. The metabolomics data generated here will be readily integrated (in Core C) with the
gut microbiome (Project 1), single-cell transcriptome data (Project 2), and epigenomic data (ongoing U19 project),
serving as potential mechanistic mediators linking these omics signatures with osteoporosis and OF."

The goal of the Admin/Coordination Core (ACC) is to provide administrative leadership and to guarantee that all
UCI subunits are interacting and communicating efficiently. Integration with the other consortium members,
Indiana University (IU)/The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)/University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) as well as with Sage
Bionetworks and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) are also key objectives for the ACC. As the leadership
core of UCI MODEL-AD, our goal is to ensure the success of the project by managing and supporting the different
cores in order to develop and characterize novel Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) mouse models as well
as to efficiently distribute them to the scientific community. During the past five years, the ACC has successfully
promoted innovative approaches for the generation of new mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by
providing necessary support to the Disease Modeling Project (DMP) Core and the Bioinformatics and Data
Management Core (BDMC) (now called the Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Data Management Core
[FGBDMC]). Moreover, all mouse models generated during the first iteration of this U54 are now available
through our partner, JAX, with no restrictions to academic and non-academic scientific community; and the data
obtained from the deep phenotyping of these mouse models is publicly available through our partnership with
Sage Bionetworks. The innovative leadership style of the Co-PIs, Drs. LaFerla, Tenner and Green, as well as
their strong experience managing multi-investigator grants, has been a valuable asset to UCI MODEL-AD,
leading to a harmonious and open communication and collaboration among all the core leaders and personnel.
Their continuous interactions with the Steering Committee as well as the External Advisory Board (EAB), via
recurrent meetings organized by the ACC, will help the core leaders to prioritize the generation of new mouse
models and select the most promising ones for a deep phenotyping characterization. As one of the main goals
of U54 is the dissemination of knowledge, the ACC will also coordinate the participation of UCI MODEL-AD in
several international scientific meetings, including those organized by the NIA. In summary, the ACC will play
the key role of being the management engine for this project and will ultimately ensure its success."

Clinical neuroimaging of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) subjects is a critical aspect of understanding disease onset,
progression, and response to therapies. The UCI MODEL-AD team is developing new mouse models of AD that
more readily recapitulate the human disease. As new mouse models are generated by the Disease Model
Development and Phenotyping Project (DMP), the Neuroimaging and Neurovascular Core (NIVC) will undertake
a compendium of imaging modalities to deeply phenotype these mice using clinically relevant, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) sequences to probe structure, tissue cellularity, and physiological functions in an age,
sex and diet dependent manner. The NIVC will also undertake a novel vessel-painting approach that labels the
cerebrovasculature. The goals of the NIVC are to significantly increase our structural and functional
understanding of how the MODEL AD mouse brain responds to genetic perturbations reminiscent of human AD
and to link these discoveries to clinical AD imaging. To accomplish these goals, we will undertake four Aims.
Aim 1 is to determine deep MRI and vascular phenotypes for DMP base-platform mice and high-interest models.
This Aim will use standardized (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; ADNI-derived) and innovative
multimodal MRI techniques to describe structural, vascular, structural/functional connectivity, and metabolic
signatures in emerging AD mouse models. Aim 2 is to facilitate biomarker development by integrating MRI with
histopathological and multi-omic data. Here, NIVC data will be merged with DMP and Functional Genomics
Bioinformatics Data Management Core (FGBDMC) data to identify biomarker signatures on neuroimaging data
that provides insights on the underlying AD neurobiology. Aim 3 will validate potential MRI biomarkers emerging
from recent human AD studies, which include spectroscopic imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping.
Aim 4 is to disseminate MODEL-AD neuroimaging and vascular findings to the larger international AD
community and to provide entry to new researchers interested in AD. In summary, the NIVC will: 1) innovate
new imaging approaches for phenotyping mouse models and make these data publicly available for AD
researchers, 2) collaborate with human and mouse neuroimaging groups to pursue evaluation of potential
predictive markers that could guide early clinical diagnosis of AD, 3) educate the scientific (students, postdocs,
new researchers) and the broader public community about AD, and, 4) translate the NIVC findings to provide
new directions for neuroimaging approaches to aid diagnosis and monitor treatment response of human AD."

The goal of the Disease Model Development and Phenotyping Project (DMP) is to develop novel mouse models
of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), to deeply phenotype these models, and to make all data and mouse
strains available to enable researchers to select the optimal mouse model and timepoints for therapeutic and
intervention testing, as well as for the testing of hypotheses concerning mechanisms of LOAD. During the past
five years, we have generated and deeply phenotyped mice with one component of our base genetic platform in
which the Aß region of the App gene was humanized, and we have recently introduced the second component,
a humanized MAPT (TAU) locus produced via gene-replacement. We have also used CRISPR and genome
replacement to model and validate nine GWAS identified LOAD risk-variants and have analyzed mice with each
variant both on a wild-type and 5xFAD background to determine their effects on plaque generation and damage
exerted on the brain in response to pathology. In this continuation, we will use the results of these analyses, plus
input from the FGBDMC and the literature, to identify combinations of LOAD risk variants most likely to
phenocopy LOAD and introduce them on two complementary hAb-KI, hTAU, hAPOE4 platform lines, designed
to mimic sub-types of AD that have been recently defined. These models will be characterized across their
lifespans to evaluate the effects of variants on the development of pathologies and subsequent tissue damage
in combination with aging. The UCI MODEL-AD group utilizes a comprehensive approach to evaluate these
LOAD mouse models, which includes behavioral/cognitive assessment, electrophysiological analysis, super-
resolution synaptic imaging, neuroimaging, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, single cell level spatial transcriptomic
analysis, proteomics, and microbiome and metabolome investigations including screening for novel biofluid
markers associated with progression to LOAD. UCI MODEL-AD will leverage the resources of our NIA-funded
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center combined with the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for
Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) and other human AD datasets to facilitate alignment of data obtained from these
mouse models to the human condition to identify the best mouse models for use by the international AD research
community. All data and models will be made available without restrictions, via The Jackson Labs (JAX), and
data will be explorable via the modeladexplorer.org website, and raw data freely available for download via the
AD Knowledge Portal."

Research Project
The overall goal of UCLA/UCSD Research Project is to investigate the interaction between the microbiome,
lipid metabolism and the host immune response in acne. The microbiome of the pilosebaceous unit (PSebU),
the initial site where acne lesions develop, is tractable, with Cutibacterium acnes the dominant bacterium. C.
acnes is considered to be one of the key contributing factors in the pathogenesis of acne. The UCLA/UCSD
Research Project is based on our recent findings using transcriptomics, metagenomics and lipidomics,
establishing the goal to link together these diverse biologic responses into a model that may explain the
pathogenesis of acne. By applying single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial-seq, the Modlin and
Gallo labs have together identified specific macrophage and mesenchymal stem cell fibroblasts subpopulations
that occur in acne lesions as compared to uninvolved skin from the same patients. Surprisingly, we detected a
large population of TREM2 macrophages, previously identified in diseases characterized by altered lipid
metabolism, in acne lesions expressing both lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory gene programs. We found
that squalene, a component of sebum, induced TREM2 macrophages in vitro that were not antimicrobial, in
part because squalene inhibited production of and scavenged oxygen radicals that kill C. acnes. Furthermore,
acne lesions also contain a unique inflammatory fibroblast subpopulation that undergoes an adipogenic
trajectory and produces pro-inflammatory cathelicidin in a TLR2 dependent manner, implicating for the first
time the perifollicular fibroblast as a critical contributor to acne inflammation. The UCLA/UCSD Research
Project (Modlin, Gallo), “Acne: a disease of lipid metabolism, microbiome and the immune response”, will
initially focus studies on the role of TREM2 macrophages and adipogenic fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of
acne. The project investigators will obtain acne biopsy specimens (Hata, Kim), then address the link between
the immune response in acne lesions to the microbiome and lipid metabolism. The Research Project will be
supported by a UCLA Bioinformatics Core (Pellegrini, Yang) to analyze scRNA-seq and spatial-seq of acne
lesions, a UCSD Microbiology and Metagenomics Core (Gallo, O’Neill) to isolate and characterize C. acnes
strains, and lipidomics analysis (Bensinger, UCLA) of biopsy specimens and key cell types derived in vitro.
Ultimately, Bioinformatics core will use mergeomics to combine data from transcriptomics, metagenomics and
lipidomics to create a network model of the pathogenesis of acne. The proposed studies will provide new
insights into how lipid metabolism and the skin microbiome shapes cutaneous immune responses contributing
to inflammation, with the potential for intervention in skin disease."
10912731,"Project Summary
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Fragile X-associated/Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) are two FRAXopathies
which are characterized by the unstable expansion of a CGG short tandem repeat (STR) located in the 5'
untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion of the CGG tract from wild
type length (WT, <55 CGG STR) to premutation (PM, 55-200 CGGs) results in a dramatic increase in FMR1
transcription with no noticeable elevation in levels of the protein it encodes (FMRP). Upon expansion to full
mutation (FM, >200 CGGs), FMR1 is silenced via DNA methylation and, consequently, FMRP also reduces to
baseline levels. Neither the removal of DNA methylation over the promoter and CGG tract nor transgene
rescue cannot fully restore healthy phenotypes suggesting FMR1 and FMRP dysregulation are not the only
disease drivers. The objective of my proposal is to investigate the RNA-mediated mechanisms driving
disease-associated H3K9me3 deposition, trans interactions, and genome-wide STR instability in FXS. My
central hypothesis is that FMR1 or FMR1-AS1 RNAs influence pathological heterochromatin deposition in a
CGG length-dependent manner by toggling between sequestering key chromatin readers, writers, and erasers
in inclusion bodies and forming toxic DNA:RNA structures locally and at distal loci. I have formulated my
hypothesis based on our recent surprising observations that (1) Megabase-scale heterochromatin domains
are acquired on autosomes and the X chromosome and spatially connect in ectopic inter-chromosomal
interactions FM FXS in a manner that is dependent on the length of the CGG STR and (2) cut-back of the FM
CGG to PM, or overexpression of PM-length CGG RNA, can reverse pathologic H3K9me3 deposition in FXS.
Moreover, in established literature, PM-length CGG RNA forms nuclear inclusion bodies, whereas FM-length
CGG can form toxic DNA-RNA R loops, but their interplay during FXS onset and progression and mechanistic
connection to heterochromatin is unknown. I will test my hypothesis by employing state-of-the-art techniques
like CUT&RUN, Hi-C, MapR, RADICL-seq, and ChlRP-MS in induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated to
neural progenitors (iPSC-NPCs) across a range of CGG STR expansions and engineered cut-backs to shorter
tracts. Upon successful completion of my experiments, I will elucidate the protein components of nuclear CGG
RNA inclusion bodies, the location and sequence of RNA:DNA hybrids and R loops, heterochromatin
placement, and genome folding features genome-wide as a function of CGG expansion and contraction. My
work is significant because ii will elucidate the mechanisms by which FXS might progress via RNA-mediated
heterochromatin in subnuclear bodies and established fundamental knowledge about the interplay between
RNA-based inclusion bodies and RNA-DNA hybrids genome-wide in repeat expansion disorders. Our models
of genome-wide heterochromatinization and gene silencing in FXS will also shed light on possible new
mechanisms for H3K9me3 in other human conditions such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging."

based practice that focuses on competitive employment through job coaching and unlimited support. This

that more of these Veterans can reach their vocational potential. Ensuring that Veterans with PT/TBI can
access effective vocational rehabilitation services may help prevent numerous downstream health and
functional problems.
Project background: Many OEF/OIF/OND Veterans have experienced PT/TBI, which can result in
functional limitations and challenges to employment. Pogoda et al. found that among Veterans evaluated
in VHA PT/TBI clinics, approximately 20% reported that they were unemployed and looking for work, and
of these, 71.6% had a TBI diagnosis and were in their prime working years. Carlson et al. reported that
Veterans with PT/TBI have an interest in receiving SE services, yet are not routinely informed of
vocational rehabilitation programs. Though SE is targeted to Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI),
up to 25% of the SE caseload may be used for non-SMI clinical populations. However a recent review
found that more than one-half of VA SE programs were working below their caseload capacity and were
able to serve more Veterans. Moreover, very few PT/TBI clinics were referring Veterans to SE.
Project Objectives: The purpose of this study is to increase access to SE for Veterans with PT/TBI. This
will be achieved by (1) identifying actionable barriers and facilitators to referring Veterans to SE, providing
SE services to and retaining these clients, and integrating the SE and PT/TBI clinic teams, (2) developing
and refining an intervention package/toolkit for an SE-TBI program, and (3) implementing the intervention
and conducting qualitative and quantitative assessment of its effectiveness at local VA Medical Centers
(VAMCs) that are below SE caseload capacity.
Project Methods: Guided by the integrated-Promoting Action Research on Implementation in Health

interviewing SE vocational rehabilitation specialists and PT/TBI providers at (a) 4 VAMCs that have a
successful SE-TBI program, and (b) 12 VAMCs that are below SE caseload capacity. Based on findings
from Aim 1, we will adapt and refine current toolkit materials to develop a customizable intervention
package that includes menu-based choices (e.g., educational materials, marketing practices to facilitate
integration between the SE and PT/TBI clinic teams) to maximize success in SE referral and
implementation. Finally, for Aim 3, at the 12 VAMCs from Aim 1 that are below SE caseload capacity,
through external and internal facilitation, we will implement an intervention package to enhance PT/TBI
participation in SE and document: (a) its effectiveness for change in number of Veterans with PT/TBI
referrals and SE caseload size from pre- to post-intervention, (b) stakeholder (SE vocational rehabilitation
specialists, PT/TBI providers, Veterans with PT/TBI) perceptions of implementation and SE program
progress, (c) Veteran vocational and nonvocational outcomes, and (d) SE program fidelity. We will follow
each site's progress over an 18-month implementation and evaluation period."

integration between the SE and PT/TBI clinic teams) to maximize success in SE referral and
implementation. Finally, for Aim 3, at the 12 VAMCs from Aim 1 that are below SE caseload capacity,
through external and internal facilitation, we will implement an intervention package to enhance PT/TBI
participation in SE and document: (a) its effectiveness for change in number of Veterans with PT/TBI
referrals and SE caseload size from pre- to post-intervention, (b) stakeholder (SE vocational rehabilitation
specialists, PT/TBI providers, Veterans with PT/TBI) perceptions of implementation and SE program
progress, (c) Veteran vocational and nonvocational outcomes, and (d) SE program fidelity. We will follow
each site's progress over an 18-month implementation and evaluation period."
10920475,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and microhemorrhages (CMHs) result from blood leakage across the blood-
brain interface (BBI). Subsequent millimeter-sized blood clots lead to inflammation, cellular injury, and neuro-
degeneration. Such CMBs are associated with deterioration of BBI integrity with aging, disease, traumatic brain
injury, and the sequelae of strokes, which impact >795,000 people in the United States every year. Notably,
CMBs and hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke occurrence is not random, but rather clusters in early day or evening.
Understanding of the circadian dynamics of the BBI with respect to vulnerability to blood leakage is limited. It
has been difficult to study in vivo or via on-chip models and there is no drug treatment. In addressing this gap,
this proposal responds to FOA RFA-HL-20-021. The purpose of this FOA is to support high risk/high reward
research on the blood component of the Blood-Brain Barrier and the associated Interface to facilitate the
development of a more complete neurovascular-blood model for translational applications with direct relevance
to humans. It is an R61/R33 Exploratory /Developmental Phased Award. Because knowledge of the circadian
dynamics in BBI vulnerability to blood leakage is limited, we aim to create a new biomimetic brain transport
model with mimicry of the coagulation system and circadian rhythm. We will develop an innovative microfluidic
platform to examine interactions of coagulation factors and circadian oscillations of both 1) the blood/vascular
components and 2) dynamic vascular pressure across the BBI over the circadian cycle. We propose to
reproduce circadian dynamics of the BBI by culturing human endothelial cells containing a clock-gene reporter
on the ‘vascular’ side with polarized astrocytes, neurons, and microglia in the ‘brain’ compartment. This project
assembles the expertise needed to facilitate the creation of enhanced platforms that more closely model the
human BBI. Contributions of team members will be: Han–Microfluidics and biotransport analysis; Kong–
engineering of BBI; Gillette–Assemble/validate a human iPSC circadian reporter-in-chip and assess rhythms
and fluxes, and consultation from Flick on blood coagulation factors and Obrietan on the circadian reporter
transgene. This grant will be separated into 2 phases: Focus in YR 1-2 (R61) will be on establishing tools and
in YR 3-5 (R33) on utilizing those tools to achieve our research goals. This will enable us to replicate dynamics
of the BBI in human brain and to probe it in the context of the oscillatory circadian cycle that drives integrative
physiology and behavior, including sleep and wakefulness. By targeting both sides of the BBI and their
intersection, we will gain insights into the emerging view that the BBI is plastic, changing with time-of-day, loss
of sleep, the stress of infection, and aging. This has significant implications for the role of the circadian clock in
blood coagulation in the brain and neurovascular function. The outcome will contribute to developing
therapeutic opportunities that target the temporal occurrence of adverse cerebrovascular events, including
hypertension, cognitive disorders and dementias, and gait syndromes."
10936222,"Abstract
 Numerous animal cell types have extended post-developmental lifespans, necessitating robust
mechanisms for cellular maintenance. Cellular maintenance deteriorates in conditions like metabolic and
neurodegenerative diseases and upon acute or chronic exposure to stressors such as pollution and radiation.
Moreover, decline in cellular maintenance is an evolutionarily conserved pathology of aging. Despite its
significance, our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning cellular maintenance remains
deficient.
 My lab aims to elucidate how post-developmental cells preserve their integrity and function in vivo. We use
the nematode C. elegans for its powerful genetic and live fluorescent imaging capabilities, and for its suitability
for studying cell biology within the organism’s physiological context. In the next five years, we propose to
investigate two key aspects of cellular maintenance:
 First, within mature cells, proteins and organelles undergo continuous turnover: they are degraded, largely
by lysosomes, and replaced to ensure cellular quality. The mechanisms determining lysosomal degradative
capacity and controlling the rate at which degradative cargoes are sent to the lysosome during steady-state
maintenance are not well understood. Building on research initiated in my independent lab, we will take a
three-pronged strategy to address this gap in knowledge, that will: probe the control mechanisms of an
established regulator of degradative capacity, discover novel regulators of degradative capacity through an
unbiased genetic screen, and develop a new tool to measure homeostatic protein degradation, an indicator of
degradative flux, with high spatial resolution in vivo. At present, effective methods to measure this remain
elusive; the development of this tool will not only enable the experimental interrogation of lysosomal
degradative flux but also facilitate exploration of numerous other cell biology questions.
 Second, cellular maintenance is not fully cell-intrinsic; rather, it is governed by intricate intercellular
signaling that coordinates both maintenance and metabolism across diverse cell types within an animal. The
molecular mechanisms underpinning this coordination are incompletely understood. During my postdoctoral
research, I developed the dauer – a C. elegans alternate organismal state – as an experimental paradigm to
study how cellular maintenance can be dramatically extended via intracellular metabolic signaling. We will
expand on this line of research to discover new understandings of the interplay between cellular maintenance,
organismal metabolism, and metabolic signaling.
 Collectively, this research will bridge existing gaps in our understanding of the intracellular and extracellular
mechanisms of cell maintenance, laying the foundation for designing interventions against cellular
maintenance loss in disease and aging."

There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood
tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related
mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for
childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins,
and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that
lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived
biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP)
accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We
hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional
relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis,
we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well-
characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra-
sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT-
6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children
under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV
prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted
mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse
models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with
confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1
and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and
both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be
evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed
TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut-
offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs
and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of
promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care
triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB."
10938574,"Child obesity is a public health crisis that disproportionately impacts Hispanic children. We propose a pilot study
of associations between perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with weight lost among overweight/obese Hispanic
children who participated in a 10-week weight loss intervention. The focus will be on pre- vs. post-intervention
differences in body weight, blood pressure and serum lipids associated with pre-intervention PFAS exposure.
The results will have implications for identifying factors that modify weight loss in children, and will lay the
groundwork for a more definitive and larger investigation to be supported by an R01 application.
Our proposal addresses a critical research gap. Despite widespread exposure to PFAS among children,
experimental evidence of obesogenic effects, and a growing body of epidemiologic results suggesting
obesogenic effects, the impact of PFAS exposure on children’s weight loss has yet to be evaluated. Furthermore,
no studies have focused on PFAS and weight loss in a Hispanic population, which experiences a greater obesity
risk than non-Hispanic children. This proposal builds upon the Vidas Activas y Familias Saludables (VALE) study,
a culturally-tailored 10-week community-based weight loss intervention, which significantly reduced children’s
BMI, percent body fat, blood pressure and serum non-high density lipoproteins.
We will measure 12 legacy and emerging PFAS in VALE study blood specimens previously collected before the
weight loss intervention, as prospective predictors of the differences in body weight, blood pressure and serum
lipids. We expect that pre-intervention PFAS will correlate to changes in weight loss, blood pressure and serum
lipids. We will also estimate the prospective impact of simultaneous co-exposure to the mixture of 12 measured
PFAS. Finally, we will explore cross-sectional associations between PFAS and previously measured serum
biomarkers of metabolism, lipids, hormones and liver function in pre-intervention blood specimens.
Ours will be the first investigation of PFAS exposure and children’s weight loss, and the first US study of PFAS
and weight loss focused upon Hispanic youth. Successful completion of our project is ensured by the experience
of the team, who implemented the parent VALE study, and have the necessary expertise in epidemiology,
biostatistics, analytical chemistry and exercise physiology. The proposed pilot study is the first step in a long
term strategy to advance understanding of how exposure to environmental factors, including PFAS, affect weight
loss among children, to develop targeted interventions. These data will be used to develop an R01 application
to support a larger, more definitive and mechanistic future study to address this important biomedical research
gap regarding the obesogenic effects of PFAS on weight loss in children."
10936461,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Inorganic arsenic is a known carcinogen and toxic chemical. Arsenic contamination in
drinking water is an environmental public health concern in the United States (US) and worldwide. Almost 43
million, or 15%, of all US residents, depend on private or domestic wells as their exclusive source of drinking
water. State and/or Federal agencies do not regulate domestic well water safety and quality. Instead, consumers
are responsible for monitoring their water safety and quality. In New Mexico (NM), naturally occurring arsenic
concentrations in drinking water are considered among the highest in the US. Of the 33 counties in NM, Doña
Ana County, one of the border counties in NM, has the highest average arsenic concentration, exceeding the
Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contamination Level of 10 µg/L. This project will focus on rural,
underserved counties along the NM-Mexico border, including Hidalgo, Doña Ana, Otero, Lea, Eddy, and Luna,
with residents who have well in their households. The NM-Mexico six border counties reported an alarming
incidence of 5,366 new age-adjusted arsenic-associated cancers per 100,000 population during the period 2016-
2020. Doña Ana County has the second-highest cancer incidence in NM. Rural people who live in NM-Mexico
border counties are underprivileged with lower socioeconomic status and are unaware of arsenic toxicity on
health. While the link between arsenic exposure and cancer burden is a nationwide issue, there is a simultaneous
need to protect and prevent arsenic-related cancers due to the long latency period to develop cancer in rural,
underprivileged people in southwestern border areas. A promising approach to examining links between arsenic
contamination and cancer lies in urine biomarkers. In particular, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), F2-
isoprostane, and 4-hydroxyneonal (4-HNE) lipid adducts are biomarkers for DNA damage and oxidative stress
and can initiate cellular damage that leads in the carcinogenic pathway. Our collaborative research team of metal
toxicity and carcinogen experts will detect metal-contaminated water and then identify the presence of
biomarkers and arsenic in urine samples from 125 well-water-dependent adults in the six NM-Mexico border
counties. Self-reported and doctor-diagnosed cancer history information provided by the participants will be used
to track the cancer burden among arsenic-contaminated, well water users. This project will use the urinary
arsenic, 8-OHdG, F2-isoprostane, and 4-HNE biomarkers to identify arsenic contamination; the presence of
arsenic, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and cellular mutation; and arsenic-related cancer burdens in the rural
underprivileged populations living on arsenic-contaminated well water in border counties at NM. This project will
help students, including underrepresented groups in biomedical sciences, gain high-quality, hands-on research
experiences in the execution, analysis, and reporting of a research study as guided by the PI. This project will
significantly impact the PI, an early stage and new investigator, and allow to generate data to aid in more
extensive federal grant proposals submitted in the future."
10909887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite breakthroughs that have improved the five-year survival of many cancer patients, the long-term
prognosis for many patients remains unchanged. My group has been studying the role of the extracellular matrix
(ECM) and tissue tension in malignant transformation and progression. Our findings argue that malignancy is
fostered by loss of tensional homeostasis induced by genetic modifications and a stiffened ECM that
synergistically stimulate actomyosins to alter the cytoskeleton, cell signaling and gene expression. This research
aims to identify conserved molecular mechanisms whereby tension promotes malignancy to identify predictive
biomarkers for risk stratification and to develop drug targets for chemoprevention and anti-tumor therapies. Our
pilot data showed a stiff ECM induces mitochondrial stress and metabolic reprogramming that promote
malignancy and tumor aggression in culture and in vivo. Studies revealed inflammation stiffens the ECM to
metabolically reprogram the myeloid cells towards a pro-tumor phenotype that represses anti-tumor immunity.
We determined that the ECM in chronically inflamed tissues with elevated risk to malignancy is stiffer and exhibits
evidence of mitochondrial stress. Thus, we predict that tissue tension induces mitochondrial stress and
compromises anti-tumor immunity to enhance tumor cell growth, survival and invasion and induce genetic
perturbations that promote malignancy and tumor aggression and foster metastasis. We have 2D and 3D culture
and mouse models with which we can measure, manipulate and modify tissue tension in breast, pancreas and
glioblastoma to test these predictions. We will expand these approaches with technical innovations that improve
analysis and monitoring of tension-dependent malignancy in vivo and our collaborators will assist with the
technical execution and clinical interpretation of the work. We have incorporated molecular and drug screens to
identify candidate regulators and inhibitory compounds to develop anti-tumor and chemoprevention treatments."

Glycosylation is an essential, post-translational modification with complex and poorly understood roles in
protein function. My long-term objective is to elucidate the neurobiological functions of glycosylation, including
identifying the roles of critical glycosylation sites in neuronal protein function. The importance of glycosylation
is emphasized by the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of genetic disorders that disrupt
cellular glycosylation machinery. Affected patients exhibit severe neurological deficits. The genetic basis of
CDG provides an opportunity to identify the neurobiological functions of glycosylation using mouse models and
glycoproteomics. Understanding glycosylation in the nervous system will elucidate the pathophysiology of
CDGs and other neurological diseases, enable therapeutic advances targeting glycosylation pathways, and
inform normal function of glycosylation.
GALNT2-CDG is a new CDG type caused by biallelic mutations in GALNT2, which encodes a critical
glycosyltransferase initiating the first step in mucin-type O-glycosylation. GALNT2-CDG patients suffer from
epilepsy and global developmental delay. Galnt2 constitutional knock-out mice recapitulate many of the patient
neurological deficits. My central hypothesis is that site-specific loss of O-glycosylation on neural proteins
contributes to neurological dysfunction. The specific objective of this project is to identify the cause of
neurological dysfunction in GALNT2-CDG. This will be achieved by determining cellular origins of Galnt2
deficiency-mediated neurological deficits using Cre-mediated deletion of Galnt2 in neural cells and by
identifying disrupted O-glycosylation in these cells using glycoproteomics.
This proposed five-year career development plan focuses on achieving four objectives: develop research skills
in mouse models and glycoproteomics, increase my knowledgebase in neuroscience and glycobiology,
establish a body of work focusing on the role of glycosylation in the context of neurobiology, and obtain the
necessary skills to transition to independence. Mentoring will be provided by Dr. Zhaolan Zhou, a recognized
leader in the development and investigation of mouse models of genetic disorders that affect brain
development and function, and Dr. Benjamin Garcia, a recognized expert in developing quantitative mass
spectrometry techniques to interrogate post-translational modifications.
The skill set developed through these investigations and career development plan will make me uniquely
poised to uncover glycosylation-mediated mechanisms of CDG and other neurological diseases, as well as to
elucidate the critical roles of glycosylation in human neurological function. These studies will generate new
tools and a foundation to establish a long-term research program to investigate the pathophysiology of various
glycosylation-related disorders in the nervous system and prepare me to become an independent R01-funded
physician scientist."

This proposal is for a new T32 predoctoral program to train the next generation of multi-disciplinary cancer
researchers with the expertise to unravel the complexity of factors underlying cancer risk and disparities. The
rationale for this T32 is to bridge the gaps between cancer research fields with integrative education and holistic
professional development. The T32 leverages strengths of Stanford University and the Silicon Valley to provide
specialized cancer-focused training across traditionally distinct fields. The program blends in a highly interactive
fashion training opportunities in coursework, seminars, internships at Stanford University and local biotech
companies, and mentored research projects. Coursework and seminars include core offerings newly developed
for this program. Trainees will learn the methods and technologies used in foundational disciplines of cancer
research: epidemiology, biostatistics, genetics, omics, environmental health, health disparities, and community-
engaged research. The program will also train students with the concept of “cells to society,” the complex
interplay between biological, social, and environmental factors that shape health outcomes at both the micro and
macro levels. This approach recognizes that health is not solely determined by genetics or individual behaviors
but is also influenced by the social and environmental contexts in which individuals live, work, and interact. The
T32 is designed to train students in diverse skill sets, such as novel research methods, data analytics, as well
as soft skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership. This framework provides rigorous training, which
will be underpinned by the principles of responsible research conduct. Drs. John Witte and Melissa Bondy lead
the program having overseen multiple previous training programs and with decades of successful experience
training the future generation of cancer researchers. The T32 mentoring team is comprised of 26 outstanding
faculty members with cancer-focused research projects across multi-disciplinary fields. The program has
extensive financial and administrative support for trainees from Stanford University and the Stanford Cancer
Institute, rigorous student advising, and 360-degree evaluation among the trainees, mentors, an internal
executive committee, and an external advisory committee. By integrating multi-disciplinary approaches, the T32
has a strong foundation in which trainees develop the skills vital for furthering their careers in research to
decipher the causes of cancer and underlying disparities, ultimately providing valuable knowledge regarding the
prevention and equitable treatment of this common, but complex disease."
10939390,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Site-one protease (S1P) is a membrane anchored protease in the secretory system and a critical
component of cellular signaling pathways including cholesterol biogenesis, the ER stress response, and
lysosome biogenesis. S1P begins as an inactive pro-enzyme in the ER and becomes active through
autoproteolysis of its inhibitory pro-domains as it folds in the ER and traffics to the Golgi, where it functions as
an active enzyme. S1P is best studied in cholesterol metabolism. The spatial control of S1P activity, with the
inactive form in the ER and the active form in the Golgi, underpins cholesterol metabolism in human cells.
Lipogenic transcription programs that cause the uptake and synthesis of cholesterol are controlled by a family of
transcription factor proteins known as Sterol response element binding proteins (SREBP). The SREBP
precursors are folded in the ER, where they must be protected from proteolysis by S1P. When cholesterol levels
are low, SREBP precursors are transported from the ER to the Golgi, where it they cleaved by S1P to initiate a
cascade that results in the liberation of the SREBP transcription factor domain and the upregulation of
lipogenesis. Ensuring S1P is active in the Golgi but inactive in the ER is critically important to cells and animals.
 SPRING (also C12ORF49) is a newly identified co-factor that is critical for the controlled maturation of
S1P and understanding their relationship will provide new insights into cholesterol metabolism specifically and
protease maturation in the secretory pathway more broadly. In preliminary work, we obtained a high-resolution
structure of the soluble S1P-SPRING complex using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural and
biochemical data develop the hypothesis for a proposed mechanism where SPRING matures S1P by competing
with and displacing an inhibitory pro-domain. Removing this pro-domain is necessary for S1P to proteolyze
external substrates. Experiments with S1P trapped in different maturation stages suggest SPRING binds S1P at
an intermediate stage of maturation as S1P traffics from the ER to the Golgi.
 In this proposal, we will use structural biology, biochemistry, and cellular biology to elucidate how S1P
matures in the presence or absence of SPRING and how SPRING controls the enzymatic activity of S1P. In Aim
1, we will obtain cryo-EM reconstructions of S1P in distinct stages of maturation. We will use competition assays
to test whether SPRING and the S1P pro-domains compete for binding at the same site of the S1P enzyme. In
Aim 2, will use a peptide cleavage assay to determine the substrate specificity of the S1P-SPRING complex and
which S1P substrate motifs require SPRING for proteolysis by S1P. In Aim 3, we will determine the functional
consequences of disrupting the S1P-SPRING interaction in biochemical and cell-based signaling assays that
measure SREBP activity and the ER stress response."
10938964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SPLIS is an ultra-rare, often lethal inborn error of metabolism recognized just five years ago. Most affected
children exhibit a rapidly progressive form of nephrotic syndrome which leads to failure-to-thrive and kidney
failure, the main cause of death. Affected children may exhibit adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, skin and
neurological defects, and immunodeficiency. Although kidney transplantation can be lifesaving, there is no cure
for SPLIS. SPLIS is caused by recessive mutations in SGPL1, which encodes sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
lyase, a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme responsible for catabolism of the bioactive lipid S1P in the final step of
sphingolipid metabolism. SPLIS-associated SGPL1 mutations impair S1P lyase activity, enzyme localization
and/or stability, and cause sphingolipid accumulation leading to multi-organ dysfunction and failure. Unlike
classical sphingolipid metabolic disorders involving lysosomal enzymes (such as Tay-Sachs disease), SPLIS is
an atypical (non-lysosomal) sphingolipid disorder. The study of SPLIS biology is revealing shared features of
atypical sphingolipid disorders and the potential for common diagnostic, monitoring and treatment strategies.
As pioneers in the field —having identified the first S1P lyase gene from budding yeast and studied its function
for decades—we are now directing our expertise to develop targeted therapies for SPLIS. To our knowledge,
we are the only group working toward that goal. Some children with less severe forms of SPLIS may respond
to supplementation with vitamin B6, the enzyme’s cofactor. Studies in a mouse model of SPLIS have provided
proof-of-concept for the use of adeno-associated virus-mediated SGPL1 gene therapy as potentially curative
treatment for SPLIS. Clinical trials testing these two therapeutic strategies are in the planning stages. Further,
we have developed disease biomarkers and are preparing to launch the first prospective SPLIS natural history
study. However, there are major challenges to existing interventions. Pyridoxine is only useful for a limited
number of patients harboring B6-responsive variants. Kidney transplantation requires adequate weight gain, is
costly, and has high morbidity. Gene therapy is irreversible, can have severe toxicities, and cannot be used
prenatally. We hypothesize that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) represents a lifesaving treatment for
SPLIS that acts by preserving kidney function and offers many advantages over other treatment strategies. In
this project we will use two powerful and complementary mouse models of SPLIS, a well-established knock-out
mouse and a novel knock-in mouse, to test our hypothesis with two specific aims: 1) Establish proof-of-concept
for ERT as a lifesaving treatment for SPLIS; 2) Establish proof-of-concept for the ability of ERT to prevent or
reverse SPLIS nephrosis. Our results will provide the rationale for further developing ERT as a treatment for
SPLIS. Our team, comprised of an expert in sphingolipid biochemistry, S1P lyase and SPLIS and an expert in
protein synthesis and ERT for inborn errors of metabolism, along with our scientific staff, are highly capable of
undertaking the project and have all the necessary tools to initiate the study immediately."

We have identified a novel driver of treatment failure in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed antibiotic

10938834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of the proposed project is to develop a method called PAINT (Precise Area
INtroduction and Transfection) for highly localized, versatile, and efficient biomolecule delivery for
“direct-write” guided administration at spatial resolutions from single cell to hundreds of cells. One
current approach that is commonly used to deliver biomolecules to cells involves viral or non-viral
transfection. These methods do not offer the ability to target delivery of cargo to a subset of cells.
Furthermore, they are limited in which cargoes they can deliver efficiently. In contrast, physical
delivery methods offer control over the spatial distribution of cellular modification and are
compatible with a wider range of cargo, but currently operation is too difficult, and versatility is too
limited for them to gain widespread use. The proposed effort addresses these limitations with a
new technology called PAINT, which will enable very precise control over the spatial distribution
of cellular modification, i.e., introduction of nucleic acids (RNA, DNA), proteins, nanoparticles or
viruses, using a novel combination of physical delivery means to transiently disrupt the cell
membrane thus enabling cargo entry at a rate orders of magnitude greater than the current state
of the art. The proposed new technology will be embodied in a PAINT “brush,” a stylus that
delivers from one set of nozzles a cold plasma, and from a very closely located adjacent set (<<
1 mm away) an electro-kinetically generated jet of the cargo-containing solution along with a
tightly focused coaxial gas jet for guided delivery. The plasma and coaxial gas jet remove any thin
liquid layers that could impede transport of the cargo carrying liquid from the target area. The
introduction of material is easily directed and confined to desired target areas so that PAINT
permits guided production of heterogeneously modified bio-samples. The development of this
new technology will be accomplished through completion of three key aims. The first specific aim
is engineering design optimization and improvement and characterization of PAINT devices. The
second aim is a careful characterization and optimization of the PAINT systems ability to deliver
different cargos to human cells. The final aim is feasibility demonstrations in which PAINT is used
to create biomimetic organoid systems in vitro.
Because PAINT is a non-contact method, it is more versatile and simpler in implementation than
micro-injection, and its electrokinetic jet can be caused to deliver cargo to targets as small as a
cell or to modify areas hundreds of times bigger. As a result, PAINT permits simple, quick
production of heterogeneously modified samples, including in vitro cell and tissue cultures."
10938972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inadequately managed symptoms caused by their disease and its treatment result in unnecessary suffering for
children with cancer that interferes with their quality of life and may impact survival. Communication that
emphasizes the child’s self-report and is actionable by the child’s parents and the clinical team is key to
effective symptom management. The early cancer treatment period (ECTP) is a key time to implement
interventions targeting symptom-related communication. Digital health tools, including mobile health (mHealth)
apps are emerging as proposed solutions to support health-related communication between patients and
clinicians. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology prioritizes the routine use
of patient-generated health data (PGHD), data recorded by patients that complement clinical data, in clinical
care. Achieving the larger goal of integrating PGHD from mHealth apps into clinical care requires attention to
data security, interoperability standards for data exchange, and representation of data within the electronic
health record (EHR). Integrating PGHD in clinical care also requires attention to facilitators and barriers such
as patient/family adherence to reporting, accessibility of PGHD in the EHR, and clinician engagement. Our
interprofessional team engaged school-age children (6-12 years) with cancer, parents, and clinicians to co-
design Color Me Healthy, a child-centric app that provides an evidence-based structure for children to report
eleven common symptoms, and demonstrated its feasibility and acceptability. Our next critical step to
advance Color Me Healthy to scalable implementation is to develop and evaluate a clinician-facing app that
is interoperable with electronic health record (EHR) systems to integrate review and discussion of children’s
data as part of the clinical workflow. The project will be conducted as an early phase Behavioral Intervention
Development Trial to define and refine key components of implementing Color Me Healthy during the ECTP
with attention to underlying mechanisms of the intervention and to identify and address facilitators and barriers
from perspectives of children, parents, and clinicians. During Aim 1, we will employ user-centered design
methods to develop a Web-based, clinician-facing version of the Color Me Healthy app for EHR integration as
a SMART on FHIR app. Aim 2 will allow us to optimize implementation of Color Me Healthy as an
implementable communications-support intervention in the clinical setting during the ECTP by engaging
children, parents, and clinicians to define and refine key components of the intervention. During Aim 3, we will
conduct a single-site repeated measures trial to evaluate the efficacy of implementing Color Me Healthy in the
ECTP to improve symptom communication. The immediate expected outcome is successful implementation of
an interoperable, scalable SMART® on FHIR app to improve symptom communication during the ECTP. The
proposed work will build a chain of evidence to meet our long-term goal to deliver timely, evidence-based care
to alleviate symptoms and promote quality of life for children with cancer."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills one in four of the people who die annually in the United States and is a
major disease burden worldwide. Inflammation is the main underlying trigger of CVD and exacerbates the
common ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Recruitment of leukocytes to damaged tissues is a key step in
inflammation and is dependent on the activation of β2 integrins. Circulating leukocytes in the bloodstream use
β2 integrins to arrest on the endothelium in response to inflammatory signals. Neutrophils express two of the
four β2 integrins, LFA-1 (αLβ2) and Mac-1 (αMβ2). Two proteins, kindlin-3 and talin-1, are required for neutrophil
arrest. The molecular mechanism underlying neutrophil arrest and how kindlin-3 cooperates with talin-1 in
integrin activation are poorly understood. It is unclear what signaling events lead to the kindlin-3 binding to and
activation of β2 integrin. We hypothesize that kindlin-3, together with talin-1, induces integrin activation by
breaking the inhibitory salt bridge within the heterodimeric α/β integrin subunits, and that blocking kindlin-3-
dependent β2 integrin activation suppresses inflammation and reduces IRI. To test this hypothesis, we have
generated reporter mouse lines for simultaneous detection of β2 integrin activation and imaging of kindlin-3 and
talin-1 in mouse neutrophils. We show initial data that identify a novel salt-bridge dependent mechanism of β2
integrin activation in inflammation. We propose to use molecular and cellular engineering, flow cytometry, live
cell imaging by quantitative dynamic footprinting, and intravital microscopy to address three specific aims: (1)
We will assess how kindlin-3 promotes integrin activation by unclasping the inhibitory salt bridge within the
heterodimeric α/β integrin subunits. (2) We will test the hypothesis that kindlin-3 permits talin-1-mediated
integrin activation and neutrophil adhesion. (3) We will evaluate if blocking kindlin-3 mitigates IRI damage. The
proposed research is innovative and significant because it will decode the conundrum of how high-affinity
integrin activation contributes to IRI-induced inflammation. This proposal will establish molecular mechanisms
of integrin activation and provide mechanistic insights for the development of new therapeutic drugs to reduce
ischemia-reperfusion injury."
10930716,"In this Phase I SBIR, Actuated Medical, Inc. (AMI) will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a
Photoacoustic Visualizer (PAV) system for greatly improving implantation accuracy of sacral neurostimulation
(SNS) leads for better outcomes with people with bladder (urinary) or bowel incontinence. The system will
enable ‘through-the-needle visualization’ and guidance control to direct SNS leads adjacent to the sacral
nerve. This phase culminates with an in vivo preclinical demonstration of visualization and placement feasibility
at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.
Unmet Need: Loss of bladder or bowel control, or urinary or bowel incontinence, is an embarrassing and
debilitating condition that greatly impacts the daily life of those affected. Over the continuum of severity,
incontinence is estimated to affect between 18M and 80M people and incur healthcare costs over $90B in the
U.S. alone, with many reports acknowledging low estimates because people do not want to be associated with
the social stigma. Conservative treatments are cumbersome or produce side effects, and up to two-thirds of
people stop treatment within a year. Because incontinence is ultimately caused by lack of muscle control, the
sacral nerve, which controls the bladder and other pelvic muscles, has been a focus. Direct neurostimulation of
the sacral nerve via an implant has become a viable option in otherwise intractable cases. After successful
implantation, long-term effectiveness of 50-80% has been reported, however, initial implantation success has
been reported as low as 24%. A significant factor in failure is inadequate proximity between the nerve and
electrodes in the stimulation lead, which is placed in a multi-step, minimally invasive surgical procedure that
requires high precision but has limited means of imaging to guide through the S3 foramen of the sacrum.
Muscle stimulation checks are the primary means of confirmation for alignment of the lead with the curved
nerve path. Representative cadaver studies have shown separations up to 16 mm, too far for clinical efficacy.
In this SBIR project, AMI is leveraging its experience in neuroscience, ultrasound and photoacoustics (PA),
and catheters/stems for medical devices to develop the PAV, a unique PA-based guidance system that aligns
with standard SNS lead implantation techniques. The PAV integrates optical transmit and ultrasound detection
to visualize the distance between the nerve and lead tract during the procedure to ensure millimeter-level
proximity for all SNS electrodes. The planned PAV system is a combination disposable kit with the PA-based
tools, used in conjunction with current SNS placement kits, and a reusable display/processing unit.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Design of PA transducers, hardware, and in vitro performance demonstration.
Aim 2. Integrate deflection, confirm performance ex vivo, and complete surgical plan.
Aim 3. PAV preclinical study demonstration and evaluation of minimal stimulation threshold."
10932049,"Project Summary
 Approximately 2% of children in the United States have strabismus, a condition in which the eyes are not
aligned properly. As a consequence, stereovision may be lost and the deviated eye is at risk for reduced vision
from amblyopia. There are many other potential consequences, including reduced eye-hand coordination,
diminished quality of life, employment discrimination, social prejudice, and psychological distress. The goal of
this project is to investigate the most common form of strabismus, intermittent exotropia. A translational
approach is used that combines a prospective, longitudinal observational study of patients with intermittent
exotropia to define its natural history and clinical features along with analysis of data from a parallel set of
laboratory studies in nonhuman primates. Aim 1 will focus on the problem of defining the severity of intermittent
exotropia. Patients wear tracking glasses that record the fixation point of each eye within the visual scene while
they go about their normal daily activities. This technology makes it possible to measure the “occurrence rate”
of exotropia – defined as the percentage of time that an ocular deviation is present. This data will enable eye
doctors to identify which patients have a stable versus a progressive form of intermittent exotropia. The latter
group may need surgery to re-align their eyes, but there is currently no consensus regarding the criteria for
recommending surgery, in part because it has not previously been possible to quantify the occurrence rate. The
project will also stratify patients into the 3 recognized subtypes of intermittent exotropia (basic, convergence
insufficiency, divergence excess) to probe the relationship between fusion loss and vergence demand. Insights
from that correlation could also influence surgical planning. Successful introduction of ambulatory eye tracking
into pediatric eye care would thus have a major impact on the management of intermittent exotropia. Aim 2 will
explore the contingent of retinal ganglion cells that projects to the superior colliculus, a brainstem center
controlling eye movements. Experiments have been performed in monkeys, injecting a retrograde tracer into
the superior colliculus to label these cells. A different retrograde tracer has been injected in the lateral geniculate
nucleus in the same monkeys. The data from these animals will be analyzed to determine the percentage of
ganglion cells which is double-labeled, signifying that the cells send a branching axon to both targets."

10932529,"BEAMS ABSTRACT: Core B
The prevalence of childhood asthma varies dramatically between populations living in different environments,
suggesting that pre-natal and early life environmental exposures play a role in establishing risk for this common
disease through influencing patterns of gut microbiota and immune development. The Binational Early Asthma
and Microbiome Study (BEAMS) Program Project takes advantage of a natural experiment in our own backyard
to elucidate the microbial origins of asthma protection. It will initiate a birth cohort study in two populations with
shared ancestry but dramatically different environments, which we have shown to have high and low prevalence
of asthma: Mexican American children born in Tucson, Arizona and children born in Nogales, Mexico,
respectively. The Recruitment, Data Collection and Sample Management Core (Core B), is critical to this
effort as it will direct, coordinate and complete all data collection on subjects enrolled in BEAMS. Core
B will serve all three projects proposed in this application, collecting blood and data for Project 1 and all the
microbiota and environmental samples used in Projects 2 and 3. Specific aims of Core B are to: 1) Enroll 250
Mexican American women in Tucson, Arizona and 250 Mexican women in Nogales, Mexico in the third trimester
of pregnancy, obtain samples for immunologic and microbiome assessments, obtain environmental samples,
and administer questionnaires for identification of prenatal exposures and potential covariates; 2) Follow the
children of these women from birth through the first 24 months of life, sampling stool and blood repeatedly,
obtaining environmental samples and administering questionnaires on exposures and intercurrent illnesses that
may influence asthma risk or the development of the gut microbiome and clinical outcomes; and 3) Provide the
resources for collection of all data on BEAMS subjects and manage all samples and questionnaires obtained
from collection in the field through sample processing in the labs, including inventory control, data entry and
quality control, and distribution to the appropriate laboratories. Core B will provide the resources for collection
of all data on BEAMS subjects, including personnel experienced in subject recruitment, home environmental
assessments, blood sampling and questionnaire administration, a laboratory for inventorying and processing of
environmental samples, and an infrastructure for specimen transport across the border. Core B will leverage
enduring relationships with two comprehensive health centers that will serve as our clinical partners for
recruitment and follow-up of mother/infant dyads. The Core B team includes national leaders in the conduct of
highly successful birth cohort studies and border health who bring long-term relationships with the communities
that will participate in the study. By implementing a coordinated approach to sample and data collection, Core
B will assure that comprehensive information is obtained on pregnant women and their children from birth
through 24 months in this unique border setting, thereby assuring the Program will achieve its overarching goals."
10932533,"BEAMS ABSTRACT: Project 1
Observations by our group and others indicate that risk for asthma originates very early in life. Some of the
implicated early childhood environmental exposures, such as to farms and pets, can inform establishment and
development of the gut microbiome in the neonate. This in turn may affect asthma risk through influencing both
the child’s immune development and response to respiratory infections such as those due to rhinovirus. Maternal
prenatal factors, including immunological phenotype and microbiota, similarly may influence development of the
child’s microbiota and asthma risk. We recently showed that Mexican-American schoolchildren living in Tucson,
AZ, have a fourfold higher rate of asthma than those living in nearby Nogales, Mexico (MX). We also showed
that infants born in Tucson and Nogales, MX, who are ancestrally related, are exposed to dramatically different
home environments and have differential gut microbiota characteristics at 1 month of age. We postulate that
exposure to specific microbial taxa in Nogales, MX may account for the relative protection against asthma as
compared to Tucson, and that this protection is mediated by differential seeding of the infant’s gut microbiota in
Tucson as compared to Nogales, MX. Project 1 of BEAMS will identify divergent early-life microbial and
immune developmental trajectories associated with asthma protection in Nogales, MX compared with
Tucson, AZ, and the microbiota exposures that promote them. Aim 1 will identify maternal factors related to
asthma protection, including characteristics of maternal (gut, vagina) and environmental (dust, water) sources of
differentially present microbiota, as well as immunologic characteristics which may relate to these exposures.
We will extensively phenotype these PBMCs using multiplexed cytokine panels and CyTOF, to identify cellular
phenotypes and characteristics that relate to exposures, location, and asthma outcomes in the child. Finally, we
will identify differential DNA methylation patterns from cord blood collected during delivery that relate to the
transborder differential microbiota and immune outcomes. Aim 2 will identify infant gut microbiota, environmental
and maternal factors, and infant immune cellular characteristics and phenotypes related to asthma protection, in
early life and longitudinally, using as an early asthma-related outcome the presence of wheezing with type 2
inflammation (T2 Wheezing, T2W) at age 2. Further, we will use single-cell analyses to identify differential
cellular transcription and development related to location and in response to ex-vivo stimulation with rhinovirus.
Aim 3 will identify the specific microbial exposures that may modulate the association between polymorphisms
in the asthma risk locus at chromosome 17q and wheezing lower respiratory illnesses at each location. This
innovative project utilizes a longitudinal, multiple-omics approach to identify potential microbiological and
immunological pathways by which exposure to dramatically different urban environments, prenatally through
early-life, may be associated with asthma protection or risk."
10932531,"BEAMS ABSTRACT: Core C
Early-life gut and environmental gut microbes have been linked to allergic asthma development in children.
Genetically similar school children in Mexico and the US have disparate outcomes in allergic asthma
development; the rate of asthma is four times higher in Mexican-American children born in Tucson, Arizona,
USA compared to Mexican children from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. The Binational Early Asthma and Microbiome
Study (BEAMS) examines how microbial exposures of both mothers during pregnancy and their infants during
the critical period of early life microbial and immune development child may explain this discrepancy. Core C will
provide biomarker sequencing for Projects 1 and 3 as it is currently the most economical, rapid and
computationally feasible methodology to sequence the 9,000 samples estimated from Projects 1 and 3. Core
C will also generate shotgun metagenomic data for P2 for n=200 mother infant dyad sample sets, representing
2,600 shotgun metagenomic profiles. Should sequencing costs decline by the time these assays are performed,
Core C will also produce shotgun metagenomic profiles for P3. The main goal of Core C is to provide a
centralized microbiota core, which will reduce variation due to sample processing during nucleic acid extractions,
PCR amplification, library and sequencing steps and data normalization using optimized protocols already
developed in the Lynch lab. The three main aims of Core C are: 1) Extract RNA, genomic and plasmid DNA,
synthesize cDNA from RNA, and prepare 16S rRNA V4 amplicon and shotgun libraries for sequencing; 2)
Process 16S rRNA and shotgun sequence data for downstream biostatistical analyses, securely transfer
microbiota data to Core D and work with Core D personnel on analyses and interpretation of results. 3) Perform
the trans-epithelial electrical resistance assay to identify nested sample sets for analyses in P2 and P3.
Core C will work closely with P1, 2 and 3 to ensure that they receive the sequencing data they need to fulfill
their aims and goals and with Core A, but especially with Cores B and D to facilitate sample transfer and
analyses respectively. Core C has the personnel expertise, equipment and capacity to provide timely high-
throughput microbial sequencing for the projects in this application."
10932535,"BEAMS ABSTRACT: Project 3
BEAMS seeks to understand how differences in environmental and personal microbiota determine
differences in asthma prevalence by exploring a unique human model: populations of comparable Mexican
ancestry that live 70 miles apart in Tucson, AZ, and Nogales, MX, but differ profoundly in childhood asthma rates
(4-fold lower in MX) and the microbial composition of children’s stool, drinking water and house dust. Project 3
builds on our findings that 1) microbe-rich environments [e.g., traditional Amish (AM) farms] protect from asthma;
2) inhalation of AM house dust is sufficient to protect mice from allergic asthma; 3) unmanipulated stools of
healthy preschool AM children, but not high-risk Hutterite children, protect associated germ-free (GF) mice from
asthma through selected microbial taxa and novel innate mechanisms; 4) individual AM stool metabolites are
sufficient to protect specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice from allergic lung inflammation; and 5) US and Mexican
environmental samples (house dust and drinking water) differentially protect mice from allergic asthma.
These data demonstrate that both environmental and gut microbiota are critical for asthma protection in natural
populations, and lead us to hypothesize that exposure to distinct environmental microbiota (especially from
house dust and drinking water) differentially shapes the composition and metabolic profile of gut
microbiota in US and Mexican pregnant women, thereby differentially shaping gut microbiota, immune
development and trajectory to asthma in their children. More specifically, we hypothesize that the microbial
environments prevalent in Mexican homes, and the gut microbiota especially abundant in pregnant Mexican
women and their young children, are enriched in taxa and metabolites that suppress type-2 responses and
asthma.
We will test our hypothesis using an innovative approach that combines environmental and personal gut
microbiota within a single experimental framework: the impact of environmental exposures on gut microbiota
development, immune responses and asthma will be studied in pregnant or young GF mice that first will be
“humanized” by association with stools of 40 mother/infant dyads (20 per location), then will be exposed to paired
dust and drinking water from the subjects’ homes, and finally will be tested in a classic allergic asthma model.
Specifically, we propose to assess how vertical transmission of stool microbiota from US or Mexican pregnant
women and early exposure to environmental microbiota differentially affect the development of asthma, immune
responses and gut microbiome in the progeny of associated GF mice (Aim 1); how microbiota enriched in the
meconium of US or Mexican neonates and early exposure to paired environmental microbiota differentially
influence the development of asthma, immune responses and gut microbiome in associated young GF mice
(Aim 2); which infant stool metabolites protect from asthma in vivo (Aim 3). Our work will elucidate the
mechanisms that link environmental exposures to gut microbiota development, immune responses and asthma
protection."

resistance), Project 3 led by Dr. Bandyopadhyay and Dr. Kuo (PDO tumor- TME acquired resistance), and the
Data Science Core, led by Dr. Wang and Dr. Bandyopadhyay. Additional goals include ensuring regular
communication with the NCI, and other ARTNet centers as well as with the basic, translational, and clinical
scientific stakeholders, and with lung cancer advocacy groups and the public at large. These goals will be
accomplished through three specific aims. The first aim will be to effectively manage and integrate scientific
projects and budgets. The Admin Core will create a Leadership Team consisting of the Project and Data
Science Core Leads, which will evaluate the progress and impact of research accomplished through regular
monthly team meetings as well as an annual retreat. The Admin Core will also oversee the submission of
scientific progress reports to the NCI in collaboration with the Leadership Team. The second aim of the Admin
Core will be to organize intra and trans-institutional activities to ensure regular communication between the
project teams with each other and with the Data Sciences Core. The Admin Core will ensure resource and
data sharing between each Project and with the Data Science Core. The Admin Core will also ensure regular
communication between the Leadership Team and the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), as well as the broader
scientific and patients advocacy community. This will be accomplished by organizing an annual research
retreat in which project teams will present research progress and receive feedback and guidance from the
SAB. The SAB will include a range of experts with extensive knowledge of EGFR and KRAS biology and
acquired resistance to molecular targeted therapies as well as clinical and patient expertise. The Admin Core
will also ensure regular presentation of our findings by coordinating travel and presentations at scientific
conferences. Finally, the Admin Core will ensure engagement with patient advocacy groups and the general
lay community. In these events, our scientific team will communicate our research to a diverse lay audience,
as well as seek input and observations from the community for our work. The third aim of the Admin Core is
to organize interactions with the NCI and other national ARTNet Centers. The Admin Core will spearhead
coordination and communication directly with the ARTNet Coordinating and Data Management Center

therapeutically counteract mechanisms of acquired resistance to molecularly-targeted therapies against mutant
EGFR and KRAS in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by delineating the tumor-tumor microenvironment
(TME) ecosystem and its plasticity during treatment. To achieve this goal, multi-omics data from annotated
clinical specimens and several complimentary model systems will be generated. Bioinformatics, computational
biology and biostatistics play an important role in this ARTNet Research Center. The major objective of the Data
Science Core is to build and manage centralized multi-omics database and provide a full set of bioinformatical,
computational and statistical support and integrate all 3 Project. This will include basic and translational science
in systems such as clinical biopsies, PDX, PDO and cell line models, and integration of transcriptomics, spatial,

statistical support and applying and developing optimal bioinformatic, and statistical algorithms, tools and
pipelines. The Core is staffed by expert faculty and computational scientists from the Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology and Biostatistics Departments at MD Anderson and from the Bioengineering and
Therapeutic Sciences Department at UCSF. This program’s PI and Co-investigators have previously worked
closely and synergistically with Data Science Core’s investigators in other projects and grant applications. The
Data Science Core will work closely with Projects 1–3 and the Administrative Core to manage and analyze
the data resources utilizing the existing, robust IT structure in place at MD Anderson and UCSF. The Data
Science Core has built various pipelines and algorithms for “-omics” and functional biology data processing and
analyses. The Core will apply these pipelines and algorithms to all types of data generated. The Core will utilize
standard design principles, bioinformatical, computational and statistical algorithms, and will develop new
methods as needed to analyze all data collected in these projects, including spatial transcriptomics, cell-cell
interaction analysis, and CRISPR- and proteomic profiling. Parametric and nonparametric methods will be used
for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Linear models and generalized additive models will be used to
find the best models to fit complex data structures. The Core will facilitate hypothesis testing across projects by
integrating datasets from multiple laboratories using various algorithms, including Bayesian network-based
models and Modular Analysis of Genomic NET works In Cancer (MAGNETIC). All data analyses will be
performed using R and Bioconductor packages. The Core will document all analyses and produce HTML or PDF
reports (using R packages: Sweave, knitR, markdown) for documentation and reproducibility and to facilitate

10932866,"Project Summary/Abstract: The goal of this translational Project within BAATAAR-UP is to characterize the
mechanisms of, and therapeutically counteract, acquired resistance to molecular therapies in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) by delineating the tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) ecosystem and its plasticity during
treatment. Acquired resistance (AR) is defined as tumor progression that occurs during active therapy and after
an initial therapy response. The overarching hypothesis is that AR can be therapeutically counteracted by
defining the cellular and signaling networks allowing tumors to survive and grow during therapy. The use of
molecularly targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic driver alterations such as mutant EGFR and KRAS and
block immunosuppressive checkpoints such as PD1/L1 is improving outcomes for patients with aggressive
tumors including NSCLC, which nonetheless remains the leading cause of cancer mortality. Despite profound
progress, a major challenge to transforming NSCLC into a chronic or curable cancer is AR that enables lethal
tumor progression in patients. Understanding the mechanisms driving AR is essential to develop strategies to
counteract it and induce sustained anti-tumor responses to improve patient survival. Critical knowledge gaps are
whether and how tumor cell/TME cell interactions and spatial relationships promote AR. Another aspect of the
evolution of AR that is poorly defined is the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that is typical
during therapy. This residual disease contains drug tolerant cancer cells and interactive TME cells that evolve
together to promote the aggressive transition into AR. Defining how this transition occurs could provide strategies
to thwart it. Our work accomplished during the prior U54 funding period showed that oncogene-driven NSCLCs
contain a rich cellular ecosystem that evolves during molecular treatments (e.g., EGFR, ALK, and RAS pathway
targeted agents). We discovered heterogeneity and plasticity in tumor cells and TME cells, including immune
and non-immune cell types, and spatial relationships at different clinical treatment states including at AR that we
hypothesize contribute collectively to AR. These include bi-directional interactions between tumor macrophages
and cancer cells and tumor fibroblasts and cancer cells via discrete signaling circuits that promote cancer cell
survival and remodel the TME into a more pro-tumor phenotype at AR. Examples include cytokine (CSF1, TNFa,
IL1b), and CD47 signaling between tumor macrophages and cancer cells and macrophage migration inhibitory
factor (MIF)-CD74/CD44 and extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling between tumor fibroblasts and cancer
cells at AR. Our goal is to define and therapeutically target these, and additional, cancer cell and TME cell
networks to therapeutically thwart AR. We focus on clinically important and prevalent NSCLC subtypes defined
by oncogenic mutant EGFR and KRAS and current clinical targeted inhibitors against these major oncogenic
drivers. Two Specific Aims are proposed. Our work will highlight mechanisms driving AR across the tumor-TME
continuum in EGFR- and KRAS-driven NSCLCs and identify counteracting therapeutic strategies for translation."
10932868,"Project hypothesis and Specific Aims: We hypothesize that the molecular subtypes of EGFR and KRAS
mutant NSCLC tumors with acquired mutation targeted drug resistance are associated with an
immunosuppressive TME including both immune and non-immune stromal cells that can be therapeutically
targeted in a way that will enhance the efficacy of drugs targeted to intrinsic resistance pathways.
Specific Aim 1: Develop and characterize existing and new models of mutant EGFR and KRAS inhibitor
acquired resistance including PDXs and PDX-derived organoids and characterize mechanistic
relationships between molecular subtypes and the TME, including immune and non-immune stroma.
Characterization will include histology, immunohistochemisry (IHC), RNAseq, and MS proteomics. We will
identify specific molecular alterations that can be functionally tested and determine their effect on the TME.
Examples being tested currently include 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1, PDPK1) expression,
SETD1B inactivating mutations, and YAP (yes-associated protein) expression. We will test drugs that target
specific cells in the TME to enhance the immune response. We are currently targeting M2 tumor associated
macrophages (TAM). Osimertinib and G12C KRASi resistant PDXs and organoids will be interrogated to identify
acquired drug resistance molecular pathways using MS proteomics, scRNAseq, and CRISPR screens.
Specific Aim 2: Define treatment strategies in mutant EGFR and KRAS inhibitor acquired resistance
models based on targeting pathways (e.g., PDK1, YAP, NF-B) implicated in current and future studies
of acquired resistance caused by tumor-TME cell networks (e.g., CSFR1, CD74). Potential drug targets for
overcoming acquired resistance to osimertinib (see preliminary data) include PDK1, YAP, NFkB, and TAM. We
will develop therapeutic approaches based on TME characterization. H1975R has a more immune stimulatory
TME than PC9 YAP thus providing a rationale for testing checkpoint blockade combined with PDK1 inhibition in
H1975R. M2 polarized macrophages are increased in PC9 overexpressing wtYAP thus providing a rationale for
testing TAM inhibition in PC9 YAP with a CSFR1 inhibitor. Residual tumors after osimertinib and KRAS G12Ci
will be characterized following treatment using MS proteomics, scRNAseq, and CRISPR screens to identify novel
acquired resistance pathways. The functional role of specific targets in acquired drug resistance will be validated
using CRISPR KO. We will develop new models to include future novel drugs developed to target these and other
pathways."
10907774,"Project Summary/Abstract
Candidate: Catherine Auriemma, MD, is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist passionate about
understanding and improving long-term outcomes of patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). To advance
her career towards research independence, she seeks didactic and experiential training to develop expertise in
consensus methods, prospective study design, and statistical modeling and simulation.
Research Context: Rising incidence and decreasing mortality of ARF has produced a growing population of
survivors facing significant physical, cognitive, and social impairments requiring increased healthcare
utilization. A crucial barrier to advancing ARF survivorship research is the lack of an outcome measure that is
patient-centered and appropriate for evaluating interventions with either palliative or restorative intent. Hospital-
free days (HFDs), the number of days spent alive and outside an acute care hospital, has become common in
studies of other acutely ill populations. However, HFDs does not account for decrements in functional status or
quality of life; and the bimodal distribution of HFDs among ARF patients raises questions regarding the
statistical power and construct validity of HFDs for ARF. This study proposes to design and evaluate a method
to quality-weight HFDs using patient-reported assessments of function, quality of life, or caregiver burden.
Specific Aims: 1) Develop an optimal approach to quality-weight HFDs using consensus methods with key
stakeholders; 2) Assess quality-weighted HFDs among a prospective cohort of ARF patients; 3) Compare
statistical power and construct validity of HFDs with and without quality-weighting in a large ARF cohort.
Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Auriemma will convene a Delphi panel of ARF survivors, family
caregivers, clinicians, and trialists to develop best practices for integrating patient- and caregiver-reported data
into assessments of HFDs. She will then apply the novel method to a prospective cohort of ARF patients to
assess acceptability, responsiveness, and variability of quality-weighted HFDs. Finally, she will use observed
values in the Aim 2 cohort to simulate quality-weighted HFDs in a large clinical trial among patients with ARF to
compare statistical power and construct validity of unweighted and quality-weighted HFDs.
Career Development Plan: Working closely with her mentors and advisors, Dr. Auriemma will 1) develop
expertise in consensus methods necessary to convert multiple patient-identified core values into measurable
outcomes; 2) obtain the skills necessary to design, launch, oversee, and complete a multisite, prospective
cohort study; and 3) gain methodologic expertise in advanced statistical modeling and simulation techniques.
Environment: The University of Pennsylvania offers an ideal environment to pursue this training, with well-
established mentors and her home department heavily dedicated to Dr. Auriemma’s success, and several
multi-disciplinary research centers with long track records of producing successful, independent investigators."
10907775,"Skin protects our body against the environment, and its ability to repair upon injury is directly connected
to both disease and survival. Failure to properly repair injured tissue can result in chronic wounds, which are
associated with severe complications and even death. Multiple cell types, like epithelial cells and fibroblasts,
must coordinate their behaviors to achieve injury repair. These processes have so far mainly been studied in
genetically homogeneous mouse models. However, healthy skin contains many clones harboring somatic
mutations, including oncogenic Ras mutations which are the leading cause of Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
 How genetically diverse epithelial cells affect injury repair is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to
unravel how cell behaviors are properly orchestrated on the single-cell and tissue-scale level during repair. The
critical barrier to addressing these fundamental questions lies in the inability to study these dynamic processes
in an intact mammal. To this end, my laboratory has established an in vivo strategy to directly visualize and
manipulate epithelial cells and fibroblasts in the skin of live mice. We have previously used this strategy to define
the roles of epithelial cells and fibroblasts in homeostasis, and the complex spatiotemporal organization of
epithelial cell behaviors during repair. We hypothesize that epithelial cells and fibroblasts use flexible behaviors
to enable proper wound healing of genetically mosaic skin.
 We will first define how a mosaic epithelium responds to injury (Aim 1). Our preliminary results show that
a mosaic Hras mutant skin epithelium heals at a normal rate and does not induce tumors, but that WT and Hras
mutant cells exhibit different behaviors during repair. We hypothesize that the behavioral flexibility of WT cells
confers the ability to contain their Hras mutant neighbors and ultimately achieve normal injury repair. To test this,
we will define the epithelial cell behaviors and evaluate the roles of signaling pathways during injury repair of an
Hras-mosaic skin epithelium. We will then examine the roles of fibroblasts in contact with epithelial cells during
injury repair (Aim 2). We hypothesize that direct communication between fibroblasts in the upper dermis and
epithelial cells in the epidermis coordinates cell behaviors and repair. To test this, we will define the behaviors
and functions of fibroblasts in the presence of WT epithelial cells and an Hras-mosaic epithelium. We will achieve
both these aims by combining intravital microscopy with genetic and pharmacological manipulations of distinct
repair behaviors or resident cell types in vivo.
 The proposed experiments will allow us to dissect the coordination and functional significance of
distinct cell activities, populations, and interactions during repair using an integrated approach of cutting-edge
imaging technology, genetic manipulation, cell biology, and single cell sequencing. Given that many aspects of
injury repair are widely conserved in other organs, our findings will be relevant to other tissues as well, and will
provide an important foundation to improve injury repair in a variety of patients."
10907777,"Pregnancy complications are emerging as important predictors of future cardiovascular health with the
demands of pregnancy acting as a “stress test” that reveals a pre-disposition to future cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in the mother. Pregnancy may also reveal a predisposition to future depressive disorders, a hypothesis
that is consistent with the co-occurrence of, and bi-directional relationship between, depression and CVD,
particularly in women. Therefore, the long-term objective of this research is to understand how physical and
mental health during pregnancy can help predict CVD events and mental health disorders in later adulthood.
The specific objective of the proposed research is to examine the association of pregnancy complications
and prenatal mental health with subsequent cardiometabolic profile and mental health in middle adulthood
among Hispanics of Puerto Rican heritage living in the continental US. The overarching hypothesis of this
proposal is that pregnancy complications will be associated with poorer cardiometabolic health and mental
health status in middle adulthood in Puerto Ricans, a Hispanic subgroup at high risk of CVD. Currently, the
majority of evidence regarding these associations derives from retrospective cohort studies that linked national
birth and death registry databases in Europe. No studies have evaluated these associations in Puerto Ricans
despite the fact that this group has the highest prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and major cardiometabolic risk
factors among Hispanics and a population growth rate three times higher than the general US population. The
proposed study provides a unique opportunity to leverage our previously-collected prospective
pregnancy data from Proyecto Buena Salud (PBS, R01 DK064902, PI: Chasan-Taber). PBS was a
prospective study of Puerto Rican women conducted from 2006-2011 that provided novel evidence that
pregnancy complications and prenatal depression were highly prevalent in Puerto Ricans and were
significantly associated with adverse maternal and birth outcomes. It has now been an average of 13.4 years
since the participants’ PBS pregnancy. Our feasibility study projects that 87% (n=1,096) of PBS participants
will participate in our proposed follow-up study. For the proposed study, bilingual/bicultural staff will conduct in-
person visits to collect biomarkers of insulin resistance, inflammation, lipids, adiposity, blood pressure, and
chronic physiological stress (hair cortisol concentrations). Interviewer-administered questionnaires, validated in
Hispanics, will measure depression, psychosocial stress, and anxiety. We will use actigraphy to evaluate the
novel hypothesis that poor sleep and low physical activity, highly prevalent among Puerto Ricans, may mediate
the above relationships. This research is significant in prospectively assessing whether pregnancy
complications offer a meaningful opportunity for early CVD prevention efforts. This research also has
translational significance in informing culturally sensitive prenatal interventions for early life prevention of
future chronic disorders in an understudied and particularly vulnerable population."
10905944,"Liver cancer remains a major challenge in the U.S. with over 41,000 new cases and 30,000 deaths annually.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary form of liver cancer, develops within the context of progressive
chronic liver disease (CLD), including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The etiology of HCC is not fully
understood and up to one-third of U.S. patients have no known risk factors, suggesting yet unrecognized causes.
Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and include a wide range of species
producing liver toxins with tumor-promoting and potentially carcinogenic properties, including microcystin (MC),
nodularin (NOD), cylindrospermopsin (CYN) —as well as the largely uncharacterized anabaenopeptins (AB). To
date, there is very little direct knowledge of the potential role of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the etiology of
HCC. Our novel work from communities in the U.S. Pacific, Northeast U.S., and Central America have yielded
compelling evidence supporting the role of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin exposure in the development of NAFLD
and HCC. Our highly novel overall hypothesis posits that cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin exposure increases the
risk of HCC independently and/or in interaction with metabolic risk factors. We propose a nested case-control
investigation of incident HCC cases (n=1,194) and matched controls (n=1,194) and incident CLD cases (n=824)
and matched controls (n=824) with prediagnostic exposure data and biospecimens (blood, urine, oral samples,
tumor tissue) from four well-characterized U.S. cohorts collectively comprised of residents of 30 U.S. states and
5 racial/ethnic groups. The oral bacterial microbiome, with a focus on cyanobacteria, will be characterized using
16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq in prediagnostic oral DNA samples from HCC (n=334) and CLD (n=164) cases and
controls and evaluated for their association with HCC and CLD risk (Aim 1). MC/NOD, CYN, and AB will be
measured by direct competitive ELISA in prediagnostic samples from HCC cases (serum n=458, urine n=216,
oral samples n=201), CLD cases (serum n=440, urine n=220, oral samples n=164), and controls and evaluated
for their association with HCC and CLD risk; a subset will be evaluated by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry for distinction of MC and NOD and main congeners. (Aim 2). Signatures of cyanotoxin exposure in
HCC tumors will be evaluated by Nanostring gene expression (n=98) (Aim 3). Our proposed study is highly
significant and has critical and immediate implications for public health in the U.S. and globally and may inform
future policies regarding environmental surveillance of and testing for cyanotoxins as well as strategies to
mitigate human exposure."

Project Abstract
Structural birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, accounting
for about 20% of all infant deaths according to the Centers for Disease Control. As a result there
is a deep and lasting impact of structural birth defects on public health, socioeconomic status,
and family life. Accordingly, Theme 1 of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) Strategic Plan is “Understanding the Molecular,
Cellular, and Structural Basis of Development”, with the ultimate goal of reducing the incidence
of structural birth defects. A better understanding of these disorders and their causes holds
substantial promise for improving the lives of the tens of thousands of children born with such
conditions in the U.S. each year. To further this goal, for nearly two decades scientists studying
structural birth defects have met eleven times (approximately every two years) to describe
progress and develop collaborations in support of this NICHD mission. This proposal will fund the
2020 Structural Birth Defects Meeting and the subsequent two conferences. The goals of these
meetings are a) to share recent, primarily unpublished research results to understand the causes,
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of structural birth defects; b) to foster collaborations among
basic and physician scientists for future progress in structural birth defects research; c) to support
training and mentoring of the next generation of structural birth defects investigators including
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and medical residents and fellows through trainee-
specific events during the conference; and d) to support involvement of women, underrepresented
minorities and individuals with disabilities in structural birth defects research through involvement
in the organization and conduct of the conference and through travel grants to attend the meeting.
The three day conference will include oral and poster presentations by investigators funded under
programs developed by NICHD and other NIH Institutes as well as presentations derived from
submitted abstracts, talks by two keynote speakers on topics of broad interest to the attendees,
a roundtable discussion of new directions in structural birth defects research, and five trainee-
specific events to foster interactions with leaders in the field. Consequently, the 12th-14th Structural
Birth Defects Meetings will extend the critical role and strong track record of the NICHD and the
structural birth defects research community in essential, forward-looking research in this important
area, accelerating the biological understanding of these disorders and new approaches for
diagnosis and treatment for patients."
10905480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tendons are dense connective tissues that are essential for mobility. These tissues are complex and are
exposed to different biologic, biochemical, metabolic, and biomechanical environments. Additionally these
environments change over the lifespan. Tendons function in high stress conditions and are challenging to
maintain healthy homeostasis, regenerate, and repair. Tendons are essential for improved health span
which is driven by maintaining movement and mobility for patients. The necessity for improved treatment
and diagnosis of tendon disorders and the unmet need for improved understanding of these tissues has
resulted in an expanding need for evidenced-based research for understanding connective tissues and for
improved therapeutics. This recognition for the robust research and understanding of tendons was the
impetus for the development of the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) Tendon Section. The group was
formed to address the prevalence of tendon disorders and the wide spectrum of clinical challenges in
diagnosis and effective treatment. The section recognized that research had been hindered by incomplete
understanding of fundamental biology, including basic mechanisms of aging, pathogenesis, and healing.
The section is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion to promote tendon research, facilitate
collaborations between clinicians, basic/translation scientist and engineers and development of the next
generation of researchers and clinicians. An important mission of the section is to hold satellite meetings
on recent advancements, areas of need and focus on the multi-factorial clinical and research arms that are
necessary to improve and advance connective tissue health, healing, and regeneration. Previous satellite
meetings focused on basic/developmental biology and on translation and animal models. This conference
will be focused on clinical needs, clinical research and emerging technologies that are essential to further
advance tendon health. The conference will focus on the use of ‘omics’, understanding of pain and
mechanism of pain in pathology and healing, clinical research including physical therapy and surgery, and
the use of imaging technologies to identify, diagnose and treat tendon disorders. Targeted speakers on the
topic areas will drive breakout discussions and the development of consensus and/or guideline papers that
will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Orthopaedic Research to direct the field moving
forward. The section has a strong interest in promoting equity, inclusion, and diversity, providing
opportunities, training, and mentoring for trainees to interact with PIs and clinicians. We anticipate that this
meeting will have a strong impact on tendon research and will promote increased rigor and reproducibility,
understanding of clinical needs, foster interdisciplinary research, and collaborations."
10905493,"Abstract: People who use drugs (PWUD) and are pregnant or postpartum are trying to survive at the
intersection of 2 of the gravest public health crises confronting the 21st century US: epidemics of (1)
drug-related harms, and (2) maternal morbidity and mortality. The US has the highest rate of maternal mortality
of all high-income countries, and analyses of death certificates suggest that 11% of deaths during pregnancy
and17% of postpartum deaths are drug-related. This crisis is escalating: rates of opioid use disorder diagnosis
at delivery quintupled between 2004-2015, and rates of amphetamine-related diagnosis at delivery doubled. In
the midst of this escalating crisis, public health has failed to adequately mobilize. Intervention develop-
ment is stymied by limited evidence about which harms PWUD suffer while pregnant or postpartum. Tailoring
and locating interventions is challenging, because we know exceptionally little about who suffers these harms,
overall or among structurally marginalized subpopulations; about where PWUD suffering these harms cluster
spatially; or about when during the highly dynamic 21 months of pregnancy and the postpartum year they suf-
fer them. Further, few studies have identified intervention targets: the decades of “risk environment” research
about why PWUD in the general (i.e., not pregnant or postpartum) population experience specific drug-related
harms has rarely focused on pregnant/ postpartum people. By generating essential evidence that answers
these fundamental questions, the proposed longitudinal study is designed to support a new arena of
interventions to help PWUD survive the 21 months they are pregnant and postpartum. By using rigorous
methods to analyze a novel longitudinal hospital database spanning 17 states from 2017-2022 and a recently
created CDC maternal mortality database spanning 36 states in 2018-2022, we will generate panoramic evi-
dence about (1a) the incidences of hospital encounters for specific drug-related morbidities across the 7 quar-
ters PWUD are pregnant and postpartum, overall and by race/ ethnicity, insurance status, and rurality, and (1b)
spatiotemporal variations in these incidences; and about (2a) the incidences of drug-related maternal mortality,
overall and by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and rurality; and (2b) spatiotemporal variations in these inci-
dences. Guided by the Intersectional Risk Environment Model, we will next (3) apply Bayesian models to iden-
tify risk environment features correlated with spatiotemporal variations in these morbidity and mortality inci-
dences, overall and by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and rurality. A National Advisory Board of PWUD, harm
reduction advocates, and reproductive justice advocates, and representatives of state agencies and Maternal
Mortality Review Committees, will inform the construction of Aim 1&2 incidence measures; prioritize which risk
environment features to analyze in Aim 3&4; and support dissemination of Aim 1-4 results so they rapidly in-
form the development of interventions to help PWUD survive the 21 months they are pregnant and postpartum."
10905606,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Myeloid cells are one of the most abundant immune infiltrates in the glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment
(TME); they can constitute 20-30% of the tumor mass and are either of hematopoietic origin or are tissue-
resident. Myeloid cells play a crucial role in shaping the TME, promoting tumor growth, regulating adaptive
immunity, and in response to therapy. Due to these significant roles, myeloid cells are an essential subject of
intensive research and therapeutic target development. However, targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells has
been remarkably challenging. One of the critical factors underlying this difficulty is our incomplete understanding
of their heterogeneity and of the interactions between various myeloid subsets. This application is focused on
myeloid subsets, referred to as monocytes and neutrophils, which infiltrate tumors from the blood circulation and
differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils. We provide evidence that
both populations infiltrate GBM, but that their composition differs; while monocytes are enriched in Proneural
and Classical GBM, Mesenchymal GBM shows increased neutrophils in addition to increased microglia
presence. Using genetically-engineered mouse models driven by human GBM-specific driver mutations, we
discovered that tumor growth was not impaired when the influx of monocytes was abolished in murine Proneural
monocyte-enriched GBM due to compensatory recruitment of neutrophils, which resulted in PN-> MES transition
of tumors. We hypothesize that although monocyte and neutrophil infiltration differ in various GBM subtypes,
they share many common tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive functions. Thus, targeting one population
will lead to infiltration of the other, but targeting both will lead to impaired tumor growth, increased activation of
T-cells, and improved immune surveillance. To address our hypothesis, we will: (1) determine how the spatial
and genetic heterogeneity of GBM affects myeloid infiltration and expression profiles using single-cell RNA-
sequencing, spatial multiomics, and multiplex FACS with a major focus on neutrophils in the presence and
absence of monocyte infiltration. We will functionally characterize myeloid subsets, test their immunosuppressive
properties, and identify how TNFα signaling and/or other neutrophil-driven gliomagens regulate neutrophil-tumor
crosstalk to promote GBM growth in the presence or absence of monocytes; and (2) determine the biological
significance on GBM tumor growth and immunity when infiltration of both myeloid subsets from blood is
abolished. These studies have the potential to help us to understand better the remaining challenges of
macrophage- and chemokine-targeted therapies in cancer. We will also determine the therapeutic efficacy of
two small-molecule inhibitors targeting monocytes and neutrophil influx into tumors."
10908337,"Antiresorptive medications, particularly bisphosphonates (BPs) and denosumab are potent inhibitors of
osteoclast function and are used to manage skeletal diseases such as bone malignancy or osteoporosis.
Although clinically important, these medications are associated with medication related osteonecrosis of the
jaw (MRONJ), a rare but serious side effect, that can cause debilitating pain and morbidity. Moreover, the fear
of developing MRONJ has contributed to a progressive decline in patient compliance with antiresorptive use,
and a looming crisis in osteoporosis. Improving MRONJ prevention, diagnosis and treatment would have a
great impact in health care of patients with skeletal diseases. From studies supported by the parent grant, our
well-established, interdisciplinary team of clinician-scientists has made important contributions to the
pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of MRONJ. Collectively, our studies have provided significant
insight into MRONJ pathogenesis. In control animals with dental disease, bone resorbs away from the
inflammatory nidus. In contrast, osteoclast inhibition leads to bone being exposed to inflammation, and to
osteonecrosis adjacent to inflammatory foci. Epithelial migration occurs in both control and antiresorptive
treated animals. However, with inhibition of bone resorption, the epithelium descends towards the alveolar
crest, and eventually rims the necrotic bone, resulting in bone exposure. Extraction of teeth with dental
disease, results in conspicuous MRONJ. In contrast, after extraction of healthy teeth in animals on
antiresorptives mucosal and socket healing is achieved. Through our studies, we have developed and
characterized animal models of MRONJ by inducing experimental periodontal or periapical disease and
treating with high-dose antiresorptives, in the absence of tooth extraction. These models capture early tissue
changes during MRONJ initiation. Based on our published and preliminary findings, we hypothesize that
initiation of the pathophysiologic framework that eventually leads to clinically exposed bone involves an
interplay among dying osteocytes, challenged soft tissue homeostasis, and a distorted immune response. Our
objective is to determine the early pathophysiologic mechanisms of MRONJ initiation and progression and to
pursue effective therapeutic interventions. To meet our objective and test our hypothesis, we propose three
Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the extent to which HMGB1 released from necrosing osteocytes contributes to
MRONJ initiation and progression Aim 2: Delineate macrophage involvement in MRONJ initiation and
progression. Aim 3: Define the role of macrophage and osteocyte heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in MRONJ
initiation and progression."
10908464,"Project Summary/Abstract
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a devastating type of stroke wherein a ruptured blood vessel
leads to blood in the subarachnoid space around the brain. Cerebral vasospasm, i.e.,
aberrant constriction of brain blood vessels, occurs in ~30% of patients after
subarachnoid hemorrhage and can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia following the initial
SAH. Delayed cerebral ischemia is a main contributor to patient survival and long-term
functional outcome. Unfortunately, therapeutic strategies to treat vasospasm and prevent
delayed ischemia are lacking. In 2010 Emory University Hospital implemented intrathecal
nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker that acts to dilate the cerebrovasculature, as a
treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with suspected vasospasm. Our
preliminary retrospective results from >400 patients showed that intrathecal nicardipine
has a low rate of complications, is effective at inducing macrovascular vasodilation, and
reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia. However, selecting patients for this
treatment, as well as estimating the benefit for the individual subject is still lacking. Our
overall objective is to develop biomarkers of outcome after SAH that can help optimize
treatment strategies and improve outcomes. Non-invasive diffuse optical spectroscopies
(DOS) show promise to provide such biomarkers. In preliminary data with DOS in 20 SAH
patients, we found that the cerebral blood flow response to the first dose of IT nicardipine
was significantly different in patients who developed DCI versus those who did not.
Specifically, cerebral blood flow increased in patients who did not go on to develop DCI
(as expected), whereas those who developed DCI showed a lack of response or decrease
in blood flow after treatment (paradoxical response). These promising data suggest that
DOS may provide valuable insights into the microvascular environment in SAH patients
that could be used to guide treatment and improve outcomes. Furthermore, preliminary
data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of IT nicardipine may provide an alternative
biomarker of target therapeutic nicardipine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Building on this promising data, in this proposal we will determine early, non-invasive
optical biomarkers of cerebrovascular hemodynamics associated with development of
delay cerebral ischemia (Aim 1), and we will prospectively determine the relationship
between IT nicardipine pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid and outcome (Aim 2)."

Mount Sinai’s Institute for Exposomic Research requests support for an annually held international
series of 5 symposia focused on Exposomics, Aging, and Alzheimer’s disease Across the Life Course. The
exposome is the study of all the health relevant environmental factors encountered across life.
Exposomics is a complex “big data” science with branches that include climate and health, untargeted
chemical assays, satellite remote sensing, wearable devices, and social media mining among other
measures. Mount Sinai has been hosting Exposome symposia annually since 2018 and our team has
successfully hosted meetings internationally in Europe and Latin America already. Our goals are to
advance exposomic science globally in order to accelerate research in exposomics in Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Dementias (ADRD). These symposia will foster new research collaborations and catalyze a
critical mass of researchers working in Aging and Exposomics. Many of the attendees, including junior
faculty, are or will become future leaders in the exposomics of aging. These conferences will also
targeted health disparities around ADRD and promote policy and research initiative designed to address
those disparities. Our R13 proposal has multiple highly committed partners already. Our meetings will
be held in 5 locations-Japan, Mexico, France, Rwanda and Meharry Medical College, a historically Black
College/University. We have strategically designed our program to promote diversity, equity and
inclusion in ADRD Exposomic Research and to address the role of environment and aging globally. By
doing so, we maximize its impact. Each symposia is preceded by a ½ day workshop (e.g. ArcGIS and
mapping the exposome, untargeted chemical assay and their analysis, mining google maps and mining
social media platforms are all examples of planned workshops). We will invite prominent speakers from
major research institutions. For example several NIH Institute directors as well as the NIH ECHO and All-
of-US program directors have been presenters at our symposia). Local experts from the host countries
will be prioritized as presenters, and we will include U.S. leaders in exposomic science and leaders in
ADRD research from across the country. Our poster sessions will bring together junior scientists with
established researchers, and we will use R13 funding for travel awards targeting underrepresented
scientists, junior faculty and trainees from developing/middle income countries and the U.S. Each
program is evaluated by attendees, and evaluation data will be used to improve each subsequent
symposium. We will track our ability to attract diverse participants. We will also track attendees and
activities employ a Kirkpatrick Model-based survey to measure participant satisfaction, increases in
knowledge, and utilization of exposomics in their research.

Dementia is the primary cause of disability and dependency worldwide. In the United States, minoritized
populations - including African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanic/Latino individuals -
are more likely to develop dementia than non-Latino Whites and Asian Americans. There is a paucity of data
on the impact of lifecourse, biological and structural factors on dementia risk in these underserved populations.
This is in part due to the historic exclusion of these populations from research into ADRDs. The proposed
conference will bring together established and early career researchers to examine these existing disparities
through a health equity lens. To catalyze vital conversations on the topic of disparities in ADRDs, the
Alzheimer’s Association hosted the first 2 Promoting Diverse Perspectives: Addressing Health Disparities
Related to Alzheimer’s and All Dementias conferences in 2021 and 2022. Building on the success of those 2
conferences, the Alzheimer’s Association is proposing three conferences and two workshops spread over a
five-year period under the name, AAIC Advancements: Towards Health Equity in ADRD. The conferences will
typically be two days and the workshops will take place in conjunction with the Alzheimer’s Association
International conferences held in the United States. At the core of the conference will still be the NIA HDR. To
meet our objectives, the five aims are: 1) Develop and finalize the scientific program and all logistical details for
the conference by working with a diverse group of experts led by PI Dr. Maria Carrillo. 2) Implement three
conferences and workshops over a five-year period entitled “AAIC Advancements: Toward Health Equity in
ADRD”, which will consist of lectures, plenary presentations, panels, poster sessions, networking opportunities
and feedback on the conference. 3) Facilitate the sustainability of the conferences by hosting workshops on
the off years in conjunction with AAIC. 4) Incorporate the perspectives of early career researchers by ensuring
that they are included on the planning committees to assist us in identifying barriers to participation and
retention of these scholars in the ADRD field. 5) Disseminate the proceedings of the conference in peer
reviewed journals which will help keep a record of the advancements being made in the field but also inform
future efforts to help the field move closer to health equity. Results from this conference will include 1)
dissemination of ideas for projects using existing datasets for health equity research in ADRD 2) increased
collaboration between early career and more established investigators 3) skills training in the methods required
to do health equity research in ADRD 4) awareness of barriers faced by early career research to funding
agencies and decision makers."

This R13 application is to request support for the 54th Annual Meeting of the American Society for
Neurochemistry (ASN) to be held April 14-18, 2024 in Portland, Oregon. The total expected attendance for the
ASN 2024 meeting in Portland is ~500. Past NIH financial support for the ASN meeting has been critical for
our goals of enhancing training for future neurochemistry researchers, and for implementing an attractive
educational and professional development program. ASN continues to build its scientific program around four
interwoven, but distinct, themes to accommodate the breadth of neurochemistry and to provide in-depth
analyses of chosen topics: 1) Building the Nervous System, 2) Metabolism and Cell & Molecular Neurobiology,
3) Glial Cell Biology, and 4) Neurodegeneration and Neurodevelopmental Disease. These themes have been
selected to increase our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of neural development and disease.
Each theme has one of the four Plenary/Presidential speakers and is represented in varying proportions each
year based on the submission of session proposals from the ASN membership and neurochemistry
community. ASN is strongly committed to representation at its meetings by underrepresented racial and ethnic
groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and women. While two of the
four Plenary/Presidential speakers and >50% of the Chairs/Co-Chairs/Speakers of Symposia and Colloquia
are female, we are vigilant in trying to identify, encourage, and secure greater numbers from other
underrepresented groups. One of the major goals of ASN is to advance the education and recruitment of early
career investigators. The ASN strongly supports these individuals through travel awards, mentorship, and
various training workshops. In addition, recent representation of trainees/junior faculty in Symposia and
Colloquia has been 40% for Chairs/Co-Chairs and 45% for speakers.
The annual ASN meeting provides participants numerous opportunities to network, collaborate, and exchange
ideas. There is also plenty of time for attendees to congregate informally. Multiple activities are planned during
the meeting to enhance professional development of early career investigators including 1) career development
sessions run by the early career development committee, 2) a student/postdoctoral fellow mingle for networking,
3) lunches with the plenary speakers, 4) participation in Public Forum, High School Day, and the Women in
Neurochemistry lunch event, 5) oral sessions selected from submitted abstracts, with an emphasis on
presentations from trainees, 6) two poster presentations for sharing findings and receiving feedback, 7) to
defray costs of attendance travel awards for outstanding early career scientists are available. This year we have
increased the number of awards and are committed to providing at least 25% of the awards to under-
represented groups as an impetus to further promote and retain diversity, and 8) a job-posting site and
opportunities for trainees to meet with potential future mentors or colleagues. The annual ASN meeting is a one
of a kind scientific conference that brings bring together early career and established scientists to experience
cutting edge neurochemistry and neurobiology and enhances the careers of early career investigators."
10909228,"Combining quantitative MR (qMR) with PET synergistically provides perfectly registered,
complementary physiological biomarkers. Our pioneering work during the initial funding cycle, Y1-4,
of our P41 in quantitative PET/MR, has provided solutions to some of the most vexing problems
affecting PET/MR, including reliable and accurate corrections for attenuation correction and
involuntary subject motion. These techniques achieve PET resolution close to the intrinsic resolution
of the scanner and enable a range of novel PET/MR applications. In this renewal application, we will
develop and deliver unique PET/MR imaging technologies that not only enable physiological high-
impact novel PET/MR but will also benefit standalone MR research. We focus our efforts on multi-
parametric qMR techniques by leveraging our recent breakthroughs on subspace/manifold modeling,
MR-physics informed deep learning (DL), and multi-contrast ultra-fast MR sequences. Our proposed
research focuses on developing and delivering new PET/MR imaging techniques along three axes: i)
multi-parametric, free-running, cardiac MRI method for motion corrected whole-heart membrane
potential imaging using PET/MR; ii) high resolution MRSI for multi-modality, multi-parametric,
molecular imaging using PET/MR; and iii) ultra-fast, multi-component quantitative MR using deep
learning and MR physics modeling. We will validate the proposed methods in TR&D3 PET/MR axes
of research and through collaborations with our Collaborative Projects. We will leverage the DL
methodologies proposed in TR&D2 to further improve image quality of quantitative PET/MR
techniques in TR&D1."

to have major societal impact, especially its effect on medicine. In the past funding cycle, we pioneered

understanding and extensive experience of its applications in medical imaging. In this new TR&D, we
propose use deep learning (DL) to push the application of AI in medical imaging beyond the traditional
image reconstruction problem. The study of novel contrast mechanisms (e.g. new MRI sequence and
new PET tracer) is a major frontline of PET/MR innovation. To achieve improved image quality, we
will incorporate anatomic image and motion correction in a novel DL-based image reconstruction
framework. We will also build our AI model based on the accumulated big imaging data at MGH while
also providing a methodology to transfer this knowledge to new studies with few existing data. Our
proposed domain adaptation and domain adaptation few shot learning technology will largely address
some of the biggest challenges of AI in medical imaging, i.e., limited training data, the generalizability
problem, thus enabling AI to be practically disseminated and used in clinical environment. Finally, we
propose to estimate the posterior distribution of the reconstructed image. The availability of the
uncertainty of reconstruction will open a new window for much more elegant and accurate diagnostic
protocols and early treatment response evaluation in precision medicine thus leading to a significant
number of new applications for PET/MR."

 Bacteriophage, or phage, infect and kill bacterial cells. At a programmed time, phage use a tailored suite of
proteins to release newly built virions by lysing the host cell. As the most common cell lysis event on the planet,
phage-induced lysis drives both microbial biogeochemical nutrient cycling and population dynamics in cellular
life. Host cell lysis in tailed phages is an active process carried out by phage proteins that specifically target
each cell envelope layer. In Gram-negative bacteria, phage holin proteins compromise the inner membrane,
endolysins degrade the peptidoglycan, and spanins disrupt the outer membrane. Molecular studies in a few
classic systems, such as phages T4 and lambda, exposed common functional principles governing lysis.
However, striking differences in their mechanisms of action also taught us about bacterial envelope layers and
their regulation. In addition, bacteria often co-opt phage lysis proteins to accomplish diverse behaviors
beneficial to a population such as seeding biofilm establishment and releasing toxins. Therefore, studying novel
phage lysis proteins will advance our understanding of both phage and fundamental principles in their hosts.
 Further, we and others have demonstrated that identifying or predicting the function of novel lysis proteins
based on sequence analysis alone is ineffective. Therefore, the studies proposed here focus on experimental
characterization of novel phage lysis protein mechanisms. For example, in E. coli phage Mu, where
bioinformatics predicted a canonical lysis pathway, we demonstrated that Mu lyses cells using a protein of
unknown mechanism in place of a holin. In a second example, we showed that E. coli phage phiKT produces an
antimicrobial peptide-like protein instead of spanins to disrupt the outer membrane, akin to eukaryotic
antimicrobial peptides. Finally, we have identified for study lysis protein candidates that are significantly
different from known proteins in phages infecting abundant and understudied human gut microbiota.
 Our goals for the next five years center on in-depth molecular characterization of two specific novel lysis
proteins and diverse candidates from less-studied phages infecting gut microbiota. We will use genetic,
biochemical, and microscopy approaches to elucidate mechanisms of individual proteins. Direct competition
assays will probe the contributions of lysis proteins to phage persistence and fitness, characteristics that drive
environmental microbial population composition. Overall, these projects are expected to uncover divergent
mechanisms of action used by phage in E. coli model systems and other prevalent gut microbiota. Broadly, this
foundation can be leveraged to study lysis protein types active across many different bacteria, which is critical
to understanding global microbial population fitness and turnover. The new molecular strategies uncovered
here may lead to more efficacious medical treatments since lysis is also the basis of successful phage therapy,
which aspires to use phages as alternative treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections."
10938269,"Natural products, par�cularly those derived from plants, are some of the most widely used
small-molecule drugs today, with over half of all drugs approved in the past four decades
naturally derived or closely related to natural products. This project uses computa�onal
approaches to model nanoscale interac�ons between natural products from plants, fungi, or
bacteria and their environment to facilitate use and eﬀec�veness for natural products in human
health and disease contexts. To this end, we have developed a molecular simula�on campaign
to quan�fy the ligand-protein and ligand-membrane interac�ons fundamental to natural
product u�liza�on and extrac�on. Since the natural product landscape is so broad, our focus is
directed towards exis�ng compounds where we have exis�ng collabora�ons. For lignin, a
polyaroma�c polymer found in plant cell walls, we are measuring binding to human hormone
receptors to evaluate its poten�al as a replacement plas�cizer in industrial applica�ons.
Cisprenyltransferase and the long polyisoprenoid chains it synthesizes oﬀer a unique look at
how natural product synthesis is controlled, even if the ligand does not ﬁt inside the protein
ac�ve site. Similarly, iden�fying a mitochondrial target for sorgoleone, a compound excreted in
large quan��es by sorghum roots, would open new avenues to probe and alter metabolism in
mitochondria. Other calcula�ons explore the membrane permeability of speciﬁc natural

composi�ons to elucidate if membrane permeability changes between cell types drive
diﬀeren�al eﬃcacy of cancer treatments. A further systema�c treatment of membrane
permeability in mul�component membrane models could pave the way for connec�ng modern

10939484,"Persecutory delusions, or the strongly held belief that others intend me harm, are distressing and disabling
transdiagnostic symptoms. They are the most common manifestation of delusions in psychotic disorders,
present in over 70% of cases, and exist at the extreme end of the paranoia spectrum. Persecutory delusions
are a leading cause of suicidal ideation and hospitalization amongst individuals with schizophrenia, yet
effective, sustainable treatments remain limited. One potential route towards developing new treatments is
identification of cognitive processes that directly contribute their maintenance. Predictive coding is a prominent
mechanistic account of delusions based in the process of belief updating, which describes how we learn about
the world and develop new beliefs. Development of adaptive, rational beliefs depends on an accurate
understanding of the volatility of the environment, or how frequently the probabilities underlying the
environment change. Over-estimation of volatility (i.e. inferring that the environment has changed when it has
not) drives the formation of new beliefs that are based on faulty inference. There is growing support that
aspects of volatility-related belief updating contribute to paranoia and persecutory delusions specifically.
Longitudinal data from the PI’s K23 newly demonstrate that volatility-related belief updating is abnormal in
delusional patients with schizophrenia, normalizes with symptom improvement, and is associated with
activation in specific brain regions. Yet, these data remain limited by their correlational nature. Randomized
controlled trials are the gold standard of causal inference testing, drawing more definitive conclusions about
mechanism. Therefore, to push this research forward and directly test the belief updating model of delusions,
we will recruit 120 individuals with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder endorsing a persistent persecutory
delusion and randomize them to receive either formulation-driven cognitive-behavioral therapy for persecutory
delusions (CBTp), which has been previously shown to reduce delusion severity, or an active control therapy
(befriending). We will then test whether modification of persecutory delusion severity using psychotherapy
impacts belief updating at the level of behavior (Aim 1) and neurobiology (Aim 2), investigating specific brain
circuits underlying distinct volatility parameters. Our ultimate goal is to leverage the insights gained into new,
mechanistically informed treatments for persecutory delusions and paranoia, translating computational
neuroscience to clinical applications."
10940839,"Project Summary
Genetic screens have been a mainstay of scientific research in animals for over a century contributing
immensely to our understanding of molecular cell biology, animal development, and numerous diseases
including cancer and neurodegeneration. Despite their success, genetic screens have been limited by several
factors. Pleiotropy, when the same gene is used in more than one process, can mask gene function in one
tissue if the same gene is required at an earlier stage. Redundancy, when more than one gene is sufficient for
a given function, can prevent the identification of genes with homologues with overlapping expression patterns.
Pleiotropy and redundancy are both quite common in animals precluding the functional assessment of many
genes. And finally, traditional genetic screens are very labor intensive, especially in vertebrates such as
zebrafish and mice, which has limited their full use. In this multi-PI grant, we will combine the expertise of Dr.
Allon Klein in technology development and computation for single cell approaches with that of Dr. Sean
Megason on zebrafish genetics and developmental biology. Here we propose a novel genetic screening
approach termed Mosaic in Vivo Perturbation (MVP) that can overcome the difficulties of pleiotropy,
redundancy, and scalability. MVP relies on: i) recent technological advances including single-cell RNAseq,
CRISPR/Cas9 pooled perturbations; and ii) the remarkable regulative ability of animals especially fish and
mammals to undergo “mosaic complementation”–where wildtype cells fill the niche of mutant cells in genetic
mosaics allowing for the formation of phenotypically normal organisms. Here we propose the development of
CRISPR-based MVP libraries using transposon based expression of multiple sgRNAs in zebrafish that will
allow for hundreds of cells per embryo to each receive a different defined mutation or combination of mutations
for putatively redundant genes. Given the regulative nature of zebrafish, these embryos will most often be
phenotypically normal; however, the proportion of cells with a given genotype that form each cell type will
depend on the fitness of each cell's genotype for that cell type (if a gene is important for forming a cell type, its
sgRNA will be underrepresented). Using scRNA-Seq we will jointly genotype (determine sgRNAs) and
phenotype (determine cell type) large numbers of cells from MVP zebrafish embryos to quantify the function of
all genes in the library for all measured cell types. Here we focus on the eye, because of its large size and
dissectability in zebrafish, remarkable development, and the large unmet medical challenges of eye diseases.
In three largely independent aims, we will 1) optimize the MVP approach through iterative testing culminating in
measuring the function of the complete TFome in the eye, 2) develop an ultra-scalable readout approach for
cell type based on our novel “capsule” technology, and 3) develop validated whole genome MVP CRISPR
libraries. At the conclusion of this work, we anticipate having generated key resources of widespread utility
including the MVP approach, CRISPR libraries, and a systematic catalog of gene function in the eye."
10940330,"ABSTRACT: Nucleoside transporters (NTs) mediate the cellular transport of physiological nucleosides and many
synthetic derivatives like the reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used in HIV/AIDS therapy. The emerging
toxicity and adverse effects like potentially irreversible kidney toxicity, weight gain/metabolic syndrome and potential
fetal abnormalities plaguing the most popular HIV/AIDS drugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir
alafenamide (TAF) and integrase inhibitor dolutegravir, makes relying on NRTIs, which constitute the backbones of
many HIV/AID combination therapies, attractive. As such it is imperative to seek to optimize their therapeutic
outcomes. Human (h) Concentrative Nucleoside Transporters (hCNTs) family comprises three members, hCNT1, 2
and 3, that mediate sodium-dependent nucleoside transport. In contrast to their ubiquitously expressed human
Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters (hENTs) counterparts, hENT1, hENT2, hENT3 and hENT4, hCNTs are
restricted in tissue distribution, being prevalent in absorptive tissues. Unlike hENTs with broad substrate specificity,
CNTs have limited substrate specificities, with hCNT1 and hCNT2 preferring pyrimidine and purine nucleoside
substrates, respectively, while hCNT3 transports both nucleoside classes. They occur on the luminal side of kidneys
and are principal drivers of reabsorption of nucleoside drugs like the NRTIs, which could result in toxicities. The time
is now to optimize NRTI therapies, and one way is to address their potential mitochondrial toxicity (mitotoxicity),
which is very troubling in early drugs like zalcitabine (ddC) and didanosine (ddI), limiting use. The current frequently
used NRTIs, zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC) also harbor mitotoxicity, particularly AZT,
that has not been addressed. The goals of this research are to develop hCNT subtype selective inhibitors for which
there is a woeful lack, hampering the study of hCNTs’ biology and pharmacology, and for therapeutic applications
like blocking drug reabsorption to mitigate against mitotoxicity. Unlike their hENT counterparts, for which there are
specific inhibitors with IC50’s down to nM levels, hCNTs lack them. Of note, the standard hCNT inhibitor, phloridzin
(PHZN), has hCNT1 inhibitory IC50 as high as 250 μM, with low subtype selectivity, and also inhibits sodium-glucose
transporters (SGLTs) even more potently. We are applying a multidisciplinary approach comprising structure- and
ligand-based design, synthesis, cell-based bioassays and ADMET to discover and optimize potent hCNT subtype
selective/specific inhibitors. We have already identified lead compounds with IC50 values down to 2 μM, and up to
25-fold improvement over phloridzin against hCNT1. Our specific aims are: 1) to discover and optimize potent
subtype selective hCNT inhibitors, to be used as biological tools, and 2) to use hCNT3-specific/selective inhibitor for
proof-of-concept that targeting hCNT3 can decrease NRTI reuptake and mitigate against mitochondrial toxicity. A
multidisciplinary approach combining computational and synthetic chemistry and cell-based biological testing will be
applied. The success of the project will make available highly anticipated probe compounds for studying the biology
of and pharmacology of this important transporters that are critical to the success of nucleoside drug therapies."
10939570,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective treatment modality for pelvic malignancies. However, radiation cystitis (RC) is
a widely recognized irreversible and chronic condition reported in 8-11% of cancer patients treated with pelvic
RT. The symptoms of RC can include hematuria, increased urinary frequency and urgency, incontinence, and
dysuria. Few effective treatments exist to alleviate these adverse symptoms, and there are no FDA approved
preventative agents. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy does alleviate some symptoms, but its use is restricted by
inaccessibility, cost, and contraindications, leading to poor patient compliance. The ill-defined pathophysiology
and mechanisms of RC thwart the development of new therapies. Our GWAS in six large prostate cancer (PCa)
RT cohorts identified SNPs, tagging AGT, correlated with patient-reported hematuria, a defining symptom of RC.
AGT encodes angiotensinogen, part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Our subsequent multi-site clinical
study supports the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are radioprotective in the
bladder; RC was seen in 16.5% of patients not taking an ACEi vs only 4.8% of those taking an ACEi during RT
(p=0.01). In the same clinical cohort, release of extracellular vesicles into the urine (uEVs) and increased
circulating levels of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL2 were significantly associated with symptoms of RC.
In our murine model, ACEi protected against micturition changes, immune cell recruitment, and urothelial injury
after RT. Based on these data, we hypothesize that RAS modulation and preventing CCL2-dependent immune
cell recruitment will prevent bladder injury after RT. Our objectives are to characterize and investigate the
mechanistic role of RAS and its pharmacologic modulation in tissue inflammation and injury in the bladder after
RT and develop a urine-based biomarker of clinical RC. Our four specific aims use a combined preclinical and
translational approach: Aim 1: To characterize mechanisms of bladder inflammation and immune cell
recruitment in the development of bladder injury after single dose and fractionated RT, as a function of dose and
irradiated volume; Aim 2: To determine optimal duration of ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to elicit
maximal radioprotection, and the mechanism of prevention of progressive bladder injury, and determine the
therapeutic ratio using an orthotopic PCa model; Aim 3: To assess bladder uEV release kinetics by nanoparticle
tracking analyses as a predictive biomarker of RT injury, and characterize EV cargo proteins and functional
ability to induce cellular stress/damage response in our mouse models; and Aim 4: To validate uEV kinetics as
a biomarker of late RC, and predictor of RAS modulator response, using biosamples in two clinical studies of
men receiving RT for PCa. An EV biomarker could be used to identify patients needing early mitigating
interventions, such as an ACEi, to avoid progression to severe RC."
10940398,"The discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other genes of homologous recombination repair, and the
characterization of the roles of these genes in inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, have had a
tremendous impact on cancer prevention and treatment. Yet family history remains one of the most important
risk factors for these cancers, and a great deal of that risk remains unexplained. We propose two hypotheses.:
(1) In some families, breast cancer is due to previously cryptic non-coding variation altering transcription and/or
expression of known breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD51C,
RAD51D, and TP53); and (2) In some families, breast cancer is due to rare or private non-coding variants
regulating expression of critical genes with no cancer-predisposing alleles in coding sequence.
To test these hypotheses, we will deploy new technologies: long-read sequencing of genomic and cDNA; Fiber-
seq identification of regions of open chromatin in cell types of choice; massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA)
to compare effects of variant versus reference alleles for many sites simultaneously; and CRISPR inhibition
(CRISPRi) of candidate regulatory regions. We propose to integrate these approaches to discover and
characterize classes of non-coding pathogenic variation in 1253 extended families, severely affected with breast
and/or ovarian cancer, but for whom no causal variants have been found by any current genomic technology.
In Aim 1, we will use adaptive-sampling long-read genomic sequencing to determine the spectrum of all classes
of rare non-coding variants in the extended TADs of the known breast cancer genes. In Aim 2. we will use long-
read cDNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional consequences of the complex SVs and rare deep intronic
SNVs co-segregating with breast cancer (from Aim 1). In Aim 3, we will use Fiber-seq analyses (already in hand)
of fallopian tube epithelial cells and MCF10A mammary cells to identify candidate regulatory regions of breast
cancer genes. Then, for rare variants in these peaks that are co-inherited with breast cancer in unsolved families,
we will use MPRA to test allele-specific differences in reporter activity; and in parallel silence the regions with
CRISPRi to evaluate their effects on gene expression. In Aim 4, we will extend Aim 3 genome-wide, to identify
variants near other breast cancer-relevant genes that lie in open chromatin regions, that co-segregate with breast
cancer in unsolved families, and that reveal allele-specific differences in regulatory activity.
We expect to discover clinically meaningful genetic variation in non-coding regulatory regions, including in
repetitive genomic neighborhoods particularly subject to complex rearrangement. We expect that this approach
will be directly applicable to any complex diseases with an inherited genetic influence."
10941693,"Project Summary
Sex chromosomes are key drivers of intersexual diversity by harboring sex-limited genes and mediating sex-
specific expression from the autosomes. In recent years, we have come to understand sex as a complex
phenotype, with morphology and behavior that can be tremendously diverse not just between the sexes
(intersexual diversity) but also within the sexes (intrasexual diversity). Intrasexual diversity has long been
appreciated in evolutionary biology as the substrate for sexual selection, but the mechanisms by which sex
chromosomes generate such intrasexual diversity are less known. The non-recombining nature of Y
chromosomes subjects them to unique evolutionary processes, which have made them powerful regulators that
drive differences in autosomal gene expression between the sexes. To determine the processes and
mechanisms by which Y chromosomes also generate diversity within the sexes, we have developed the powerful
Poecilia parae study system. Males of this fish are always one of five discrete morphs that differ substantially in
size, color, and behavior yet live in the same population. We found these morphs are entirely inherited through
highly diverged Y chromosomes. Our system uniquely provides the characteristics necessary for such research:
(1) clear, diverse phenotypes that correspond to discrete Y-haplotypes in a homogenous autosomal background,
(2) breeding lab populations for controlled studies of development, and (3) high-quality genomic resources. We
will draw on this powerful new system to first identify how Y diversity alters gene regulatory networks across the
autosomal genome (Aim1). While the non-recombining nature of Y chromosomes is generally thought to
decrease the power of selection to generate adaptive diversity; the converse can also be true. Thus, we will
identify how the unique processes of Y chromosome evolution can actually generate diverse supergenes (Aim2).
Recent work in Drosophila has shown that Y chromosomes can alter heterochromatin structure across the rest
of the genome by acting as “heterochromatin sinks”; thus altering autosomal gene expression. We will determine
if heterochromatin sinks alter autosomal heterchromatin stochastically or in a targeted manner, generating
intrasexual diversity (Aim3). The importance of understanding the mechanisms generating and maintaining
diversity within the sexes has direct implications for our understanding of gene regulation and the developmental
processes generating that diversity within the same population."
10911071,"We propose to characterize SARS-CoV-2 interactions with human T cells and examine how this influences
adaptive and humoral immunity. SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19, the third highly
pathogenic coronavirus to emerge as a human pathogen since 2000. CoV-2 causes disease by dysregulating
host inflammation and may lead to severe pulmonary inflammation, “cytokine storm” and other clinical
outcomes. Despite this immune-mediated pathogenesis, patients with severe COVID-19 paradoxically have
peripheral blood T cells that are not activated. Based on SARS CoV-1 and MERS, T cell responses are
delayed in development and relatively low in magnitude during infection. This, along with clear evidence that
CoV-2 is capable or reinfection and of causing “breakthrough” infection in vaccinated individuals raise
questions regarding CoV-2’s ability to elicit memory T cell responses. The T cell receptor (TCR) must interact
with antigens in the context of MHC class I or II to initiate a complicated cascade of signaling events. Following
TCR engagement, signaling leads to a variety of outcomes including T cell proliferation, development of
effector functions and differentiation. TCR signal strength (avidity and duration) following TCR stimulation is
critical for driving T cell fate, and lower TCR signal strength results in reduced T cell activation, proliferation
and effector responses with a reduction in long-term memory cells compared to higher signal strength
interactions. Low TCR signal strength also promotes a Th17 phenotype associated with autoimmunity and
inflammation. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with T cell functions contributing to
replication and immune evasion. Our laboratory has studied how virus particles and structural proteins
interfere with TCR signaling in vitro and in vivo. Although T cell proliferation, differentiation, cytokine release
and ultimate T cell fate are driven by TCR signal strength, the role of viral interference in downstream signaling
has not been well studied. CD4+ T cell signaling equilibrium also supports development of high affinity B cells,
and dysregulated TCR signaling may contribute to an increase the proportion of low-affinity B cells leading to
reduced B cell protection. We have data showing that incubation of primary human T cells with CoV2 particles
or spike (S) protein dysregulates TCR signaling leading to skewing of T cell differentiation away from a Th1
cytokine response. This is mediated at least in part by the S protein activating ERK kinase, with resultant
reduced calcium flow and LAT aggregation following T cell stimulation. ERK is important in regulating the fate
of T cell differentiation, thus our findings provide novel insights into the autoinflammatory cytokine storm
induced during CoV2 infection. Since reinfection and breakthrough infections contribute to the ongoing
pandemic, studies designed to understand how SARS CoV-2 dysregulates T cell function represent are
critically needed. We hypothesize that SARS CoV-2 particles and spike protein interfere with TCR
signaling and that downstream TCR interference reduces T cell responses and skews T cell
differentiation, cytokine response, and memory depending upon the site(s) of signal interference. We
further suggest that viral Cov-2 T cell dysregulation contributes to altered antibody repertoire and
immune pathogenesis and evasion. We will address this hypothesis in three aims. First, we will characterize
T cell signaling pathways regulated by SARS CoV-2 particles and S protein in both focused TCR signaling
pathway studies and using unbiased transcriptomics approaches. Second, we will examine human antibody
repertoire following COVID or vaccination and correlate this with T cell functional readouts. Further, we will
determine the risk of immune evasion from variant Spike sequences. Finally, we will examine how CoV2 and
S protein skew T cell differentiation and evaluate the impact of disease severity and vaccine formulation on
TCR and memory responses following infection and vaccination. These studies will offer new insights into
CoV2 pathogenesis and immune evasion, and identify potential targets for novel antiviral targets."
10911076,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the pathologic formation of ectopic bone in extra-skeletal tissues.
Approximately 20% of patients who suffer some type of musculoskeletal injury develop HO. These injuries can
be traumatic in nature or controlled tissue damage that occurs as a part of routine orthopaedic surgeries like
joint replacement surgery or surgical amputations. The risk of HO disproportionately affects the Veteran
population compared to civilians, especially due to higher risk of experiencing traumatic blast, brain, or spinal
cord injury. Indeed, 64% of military blast injuries from the recent conflicts and Iraq and Afghanistan have
resulted in HO. The presence of HO is associated with chronic pain, chronic infection, ulceration, impaired
wound healing, and other related health complications. These complications from HO often preclude regaining
mobility and function in the injured limb and substantially limit the use of prosthetics, impeding Veteran
independence and return to duty or integration into civilian life. These difficulties can lead to opioid addiction,
depression, and suicide, which are all major concerns to overall Veteran health. Current treatment options are
limited due to the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive ectopic bone formation during
soft tissue healing following damage. Thus, the proposed work seeks to elucidate the mechanisms driving
bone formation in HO in order to identify new, targeted therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating
ectopic bone formation. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an essential role in regulating many biological
processes including tissue repair and maintenance. While upregulated inflammation due to injury is known to
significantly increase ECM synthesis, mechanisms linking aberrant ECM deposition to ectopic bone formation
remain largely unexplored. We have carried out preliminary experiments in mouse models that consistently
form ectopic bone that is histologically similar to HO in patients. Importantly, the soft tissue changes that are
observed in these mice leading up to HO, particularly the aberrant and progressive accumulation of ECM
molecules like collagens (COLs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), closely recapitulate the changes observed
in patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that abnormal overproduction of COL I and chondroitin sulfate (CS)
GAGs creates an ECM environment capable of activating aberrant osteogenic signals in soft tissue in HO. The
overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the role of COL I and CS GAG accumulation in ectopic
bone formation in order to identify potential therapeutic strategies and diagnostic markers using
mouse models of HO. In Aim 1, we will determine the critical concentration and chemical composition of COL
I and CS GAGs in the ECM that is able to establish a microenvironmental niche conducive for osteogenic
differentiation and verify the concomitant upregulation of associated bone formation markers. In Aim 2, we will
establish the inhibition of COL I and CS GAG accumulation as potential treatment strategies for inhibiting HO.
In Aim 3, we will identify circulating biomarkers that may predict predisposition to HO and validate our findings
from mouse model studies in deidentified human patient data through biorepository analyses to establish
clinical relevance. The completion of these studies will establish direct links between excessive ECM
accumulation and activation of bone formation in HO, paving the way for the development of new therapeutic
strategies that can prevent ectopic bone growth by targeting mechanisms of ECM production. Furthermore,
this work will provide critical, fundamental insights to our overall understanding of the role of ECM production in
tissue repair following trauma, which will inform other important studies in fibrosis and wound healing to
improve Veteran health."
10911082,"Lower airway infections are a significant burden for Veterans. Current therapies commonly involve the use of
broad-spectrum antibiotics that lack pathogen specificity and decimates microbial ecology in the human body.
The discovery of lung microbiota with the use of next-generation sequencing identified a diverse lower airway
microbial community. Our group has shown that the enrichment of the lung microbiota with human oral
commensals, such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Prevotella, is a hallmark of lower airway dysbiosis
associated with increased inflammation and immune exhaustion markers. This dysbiotic signature can be seen
in healthy subjects and occurs with higher frequency with chronic inflammatory lung disease such as Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and lung cancer. In this Veterans Affairs BLR&D CDA2 resubmission, I seek to
demonstrate how chronic lung dysbiosis is associated with increased pathogen susceptibility by modulation of
the lung immune tone through anaerobic microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in a pre-
clinical murine model. In our publications, lower airway dysbiosis is associated with increased SCFAs, blunted
T cell response to pathogen associated molecular patterns, and increased expression of exhaustion markers
and Tregs. My mouse model of induced chronic lower airway dysbiosis and in my preliminary data show
increased expression of exhaustion pathways, PD1+ T cells and Tregs in the lung, and increased respiratory
pathogen susceptibility in the form of murine mortality and pathogen recovery.
The proposed study will use my chronic lung dysbiosis murine model to define the molecular mechanisms
leading to the host susceptibility to respiratory pathogens. In Aim 1, I will identify microbiota signatures with the
use of metatranscriptome and metabolome approaches present in the chronic murine lower dysbiotic airway,
including measurement of SCFA levels and bacterial functions affecting them. I will also test whether SCFAs
are sufficient to alter host pathogen susceptibility. In Aim 2, I will identify and test host functional phenotypes of
immune exhaustion in my chronic lower airway dysbiosis murine model using fluorescent-activated cell sorting,
single-cell RNA-Seq, and assessment of T cell subpopulation function following anti-CD3/CD28 activation. I will
also evaluate the role of immune exhaustion on pathogen susceptibility by using checkpoint inhibition during
chronic dysbiosis to assess if anti-PD-1 will restore pathogen response.
These studies will be performed under the mentorship of Drs. Leopoldo Segal, Xue-Ru Wu, Jun-Chieh Tsay
and Jeffrey Weiser. Dr. Segal is my primary mentor and a VA affiliated researcher. He is an expert in systems
biology approaches utilizing next-generation sequencing to evaluate airway disease. His expertise in
bioinformatic approaches to translational research places him at the forefront of lower airway multi-omic
research. My co-mentor is Dr. Xue-Ru Wu who is an expert on urothelial disease and built a career in
assessing pathogenic mechanisms that will be highly relevant for my mentorship. Although his expertise is
focused on the urothelial tract, his training in experimental design, assessment of molecular mechanisms, and
use of murine models will be critical for my scientific training. Dr. Jun-Chieh Tsay is a VA physician scientist
with a research focus on lung inflammation in lung cancer. As a co-mentor, he will be a significant resource to
assess host inflammation, transcriptomic pathway analysis, and for my career with the VA. In addition, I
recruited Dr. Weiser as a co-mentor for his expertise as an international expert in airway mucosal immunity
and infection. The mentors and their laboratories, together with the expertise of Veterans Affairs and NYU core
laboratories, will provide the optimal setting for the development of my research career. The BLR&D CDA2 will
provide the support for my training in the methodologies and techniques necessary to complete the proposed
experiments. This proposal will provide the fundamental mechanistic understanding to expand to future
investigations involving human cohorts."
10911177,"The PI is a physician-scientist and gastroenterologist whose long-term career goal is to independently
lead a respected, multidisciplinary research program that is keenly focused on personalizing Helicobacter
pylori (H pylori) management in order to optimize disease-, treatment-, and systems-related outcomes among
Veterans. This CDA-2 is designed to transform the PI into VA Merit-funded researcher with methodologic
proficiency in big data analysis, genetic epidemiology, and advanced epidemiologic methods, and scientific
proficiency in H pylori pathobiology. The PI is well-supported by mentors whose expertise and wealth of unique
resources quintessentially bridge her career and research objectives, and by deeply supportive and
collaborative institutions. The PI is committed to advancing Veteran health by providing exceptional patient
care at the bedside and by conducting cutting-edge, clinically relevant science.
 H pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer, a malignancy which claims over 780,000
lives annually and remains the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related mortality. This pathogen is also directly
causative for other diseases with high morbidity and mortality, including peptic ulcer disease. H pylori infects
approximately 28% of all Veterans, with the prevalence exceeding 50% among racial and ethnic
minorities. H pylori eradication necessitates 10-14 days of 2-3 antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression.
Successful eradication has led to a decreased incidence of gastric cancer and other diseases for which H
pylori is causative. However, rising rates of H pylori eradication failure threaten these successes and
contribute to the massive burden of antibiotic resistance and other adverse consequences, since eradication
failure is managed with repeated courses of therapy. Indeed, in 2017 the World Health Organization
designated H pylori eradication failure a research priority area, which speaks to its critical importance and
broad health impact. The reasons underlying eradication failure are multifactorial and, apart from antibiotic
resistance, have not been completely investigated.
 We hypothesize that defining host-level determinants of eradication failure will maximize the initial
success of eradication by providing an anchoring point on which to develop a personalized approach to
therapy. We further hypothesize that a personalized approach will improve individual treatment response,
reduce the unintended downstream consequences of eradication failure and, consequently, improve H pylori-
related outcomes among Veterans. In this proposal, the PI will leverage two powerful VA databases, the
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and the Million Veteran Program (MVP), the electronic health record-
linked genomic biobank, to first construct a cohort of Veterans from each database who completed H pylori
testing (approximately 10% of all Veterans based on preliminary data). A sub-cohort of Veterans who were
treated and had post-treatment H pylori testing to assess eradication success will also be constructed from
MVP specifically (~18,000 of the over 650,000 genotyped Veterans). Using these two cohorts, the PI will define
the prevalence of H pylori, the frequency and type of anti-H pylori therapy, select antibiotic resistance patterns,
the frequency of eradication failure as well as time trends and regional variations (AIM 1). This will be followed
by defining the genetic and non-genetic determinants of H pylori eradication failure using GWAS (AIM 2),
multivariable logistic regression and Mendelian randomization (AIM 3) study designs, respectively. Predictive
models for antibiotic resistance based on non-invasive data will also be constructed and validated. This work is
significant because it will fill critical knowledge gaps of H pylori epidemiology and treatment among Veterans.
In future prospective studies as an independent VA investigator, the PI will integrate host-level determinants of
eradication failure into a clinical support tool that can be translated to the bedside for personalization of H pylori
eradication therapy based on individual-level factors in an effort to optimize Veteran health."

Chromosomal aneuploidy underlies a variety of human diseases. The most prominent paradigm among these
is Down syndrome (DS) that is caused by an extra copy of homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). As the
most common genetic disease of human cognitive impairment, DS affects about 1 in 750 live-born infants in
the US, and it pre-disposes patients to muscle hypotonia, dysmorphic features, congenital heart defects and
early onset Alzheimer's disease. Despite many progress, our conceptual understanding of the pathological
basis of such chromosomal abnormality is so far largely limited to the “gene dosage hypothesis”, which
however cannot explain broad gene deregulation that takes place throughout the genome in specific cell types.
It has been unexplored that whether 3D genome mal-folding may play yet unrealized roles in DS and other
aneuploidies. Here, we assembled a strong team to test an overall hypothesis that the presence of trisomy 21
deregulates 3D genome as an entirety and changes gene expression in DS cells, particularly via forming
aberrant inter-chromosomal interactions (ICIs). We have two specific aims. In Aim-1, in multiple pairs of
isogenic iPSC cells and their derived neuron/glia cells that contain disomic versus trisomy HSA21, we will
conduct assays to systematically characterize their 3D genome (in situ Hi-C and PLAC-Seq), transcriptome
and 1D epigenome (PRO-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and histone modification ChIP-Seq). Integrative analyses will
dissect the aberrant chromatin interactomes, particularly these interchromosomal interactions altered in trisomy
nucleus, and correlate those with gene deregulation in specific developmental stages or cell types (neurons,
astrocytes or microglia). We will use leading-edge new techniques based on long reads sequencing to further
characterize aberrant inter-chromosomal interactions, and will validate them using DNA and/or RNA FISH. In
Aim-2, we focus on functionally dissecting the roles of aberrant inter-chromosomal interactions in gene
deregulation. This will be first investigated by chemical and epigenetic perturbation in both cultured primary
neural progenitor cells and in brain cortical organoids. We will then use novel optogenetic tools to model
disease-relevant formation of ICIs to deduce their potential causal roles in gene deregulation. The expected
results from this proposal are significant not only to our understanding of the 4D genome, but also to human
brain developmental disorders. The knowledge generated here will shed light on many forms of aneuploidy,
providing a new conceptual framework beyond “gene dosage effects” to understand gene deregulation, and
inspire strategies to ameliorate these diseases via restoring 3D genome architecture."

 The overall objective of the proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award
(K23) is to support Dr. Christine Hahn in acquiring the skills necessary to become an independent investigator
with a program of research focused on the development of interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and
comorbid mental health conditions, in particular posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AUD and PTSD frequently
co-occur among people who experience traumatic life events, such as sexual assault. There is a lack of
established evidence-based interventions, however, to reduce AUD and PTSD among recent victims. The
proposed study directly addresses this clinical gap by testing the novel integration of two, evidence-based,
cognitive-behavioral interventions for AUD and PTSD to be delivered in five sessions beginning in the six weeks
following sexual assault. In Phase 1, we will adapt the intervention using an iterative process informed by expert
feedback. In Phase 2, we will conduct an open label trial (n = 10) to finalize the treatment protocol. In Phase 3,
we will use the treatment protocol in a pilot randomized controlled trial among 54 recent sexual assault victims
to evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy in reducing AUD severity and PTSD symptoms. Ecological
momentary assessments (EMA) will be used to assess alcohol use, craving, and affect during the five-week
treatment phase. The candidate has assembled a team of experienced mentors with expertise in AUD, PTSD,
sexual assault, psychotherapy development, clinical trials, and ecological momentary assessment. On-site
mentors (Drs. Sudie Back, Kathleen Brady, Michael Saladin) have extensive knowledge in developing and
conducting clinical trials of behavioral and pharmacological interventions for co-occurring AUD and PTSD. Dr.
Saladin has expertise in real-time data collection methods in addiction research. Off-site mentors (Dr. Barbara
Rothbaum at Emory University and Dr. Brian Marx at Boston University) will provide additional guidance on early,
brief interventions to reduce AUD and PTSD symptoms following sexual assault. The mentorship, formal
coursework, seminars, and national conference attendance afforded by the K23 award will ensure that the
candidate achieves the following career goals: (1) Gain new knowledge in AUD mechanisms and interventions;
(2) Develop skills in designing and implementing clinical trials for AUD and co-occurring PTSD; (3) Increase
statistical skills with multilevel and longitudinal data analyses; (4) Enhance understanding of research ethics;
and (5) Continue professional development through manuscript writing, professional presentations, and grant
writing. The candidate will complete the proposed K23 activities at the Medical University of South Carolina,
which has a strong track record of commitment to the advancement of early stage AUD investigators. The
proposed K23 activities will ultimately prepare Dr. Hahn to lead a program of rigorously-designed AUD treatment
outcome research."

This proposal is an early phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) to obtain preliminary data on mechanisms
and efficacy of a hearing aid-based intervention to prevent cognitive decline in those at risk for Alzheimer’s
Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The target risk group is 55-75-year old people
with early-stage age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The RCT, entitled
“Early Age-Related Hearing Loss Investigation (EARHLI)” is in response to PAR-18-877, “Early Stage Clinical
Trials for the Spectrum of Alzheimer’s Disease and Age-related Cognitive Decline.” ARHL, the third most
common chronic condition in later life, is associated with cognitive impairment/AD/ADRD. This finding has
recently been extended to early ARHL (borderline-to-moderate hearing loss [20-55 dB] on pure tone audiometry),
which is rarely treated with hearing aids. The mechanisms linking ARHL and AD/ADRD are unknown, but
reduced social engagement and changes in brain organization/connectivity have been proposed. A 2020 Lancet
Commissions report estimated that eliminating ARHL could be associated with an 8% reduction in new dementia
cases, at least as much as well-established risk factors. Yet, 90% of the target population is not treated with
hearing aids and there is a dearth of RCTs testing the efficacy of hearing aids in ARHL. While studies have
suggested hearing aids improve social engagement, brain organization/connectivity, and, in turn, cognition, there
is no RCT evidence supporting these observations. There is one ongoing RCT (ACHIEVE, ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT03243422) examining the effect of a hearing intervention on cognition in older adults with more advanced
ARHL. EARHLI focuses on early ARHL in middle and early older age, a critical time for AD/ADRD prevention.
Unlike ACHIEVE, EARHLI also measures brain organization/connectivity. EARHLI will be a phase II 1:1 RCT of
a hearing aid-based intervention versus a comparator (health education program) conducted over 12 months in
150 participants (n=76 undergoing MRI) with early ARHL at risk for AD/ADRD. The overarching hypothesis is
that the hearing intervention will lead to improved social engagement and brain organization/connectivity that
will lead to improved cognition compared with the comparator arm. This hypothesis will be tested with an intent-
to-treat approach comparing the hearing intervention and comparator arms. Aim 1 is to compare change in
cognitive performance measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer
Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC; 1º outcome) and by domain-specific cognitive testing on ADCS-PACC
components (0, 6, 12 months). Aim 2 is to compare change in social engagement measured by activity
participation (1º outcome) and network size/support (at 0, 6, 12 months). Aim 3 is to compare changes in brain
organization/connectivity using task (visual task, auditory regions of interest,1º outcome) and resting-state fMRI,
and diffusion-weighted structural connectivity (at 0, 12 months). We will explore whether social engagement and
brain organization/connectivity mediate the effects of the intervention on cognitive outcomes."

Several clinical and preclinical studies suggest that adolescent binge drinking is one of the major risk factors for
the development of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and alcohol use disorder (AUD) later in life.
Adolescence represents an important stage of brain development, and epigenetic mechanisms are known to
orchestrate developmental maturation of the brain from adolescence to adulthood. This research component of
Neurobiology of Adolescent Drinking in Adulthood (NADIA) consortium will examine how epigenetic
modifications induced by adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) at the genome-wide level lead to an aberrant
gene network pathway regulating various synaptic mechanisms in the amygdala that are responsible for anxiety-
like and alcohol drinking behavior in adulthood. This component will identify closed and open domains of the
epigenome after AIE in adult amygdala using Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-
seq), and the corresponding regulation of the transcriptome by merging this dataset with existing RNA-seq data.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that AIE will produce differential gene expression due to
altered status of the epigenome in adult amygdala. The dynamic changes in epigenetic targets
(HATs/EZH2/G9a/LSD1/DNMT3b) will induce changes in the transcriptome that regulate synaptic
mechanisms in the amygdala after AIE in adulthood, ultimately regulating anxiety-like and alcohol-
drinking behaviors. Specific Aim 1 will examine a) the status of chromatin accessibility and loci of genomic
epigenetic marks using ATAC-seq in the adult amygdala of rats (male & female) after AIE. The emerging data
set will be merged with existing RNA-seq data to identify epigenetically regulated transcriptomic changes, and
b) To validate expression and epigenetic enrichments of new genes in the amygdala after AIE and use them for
functional studies. Specific Aim 2 will examine the effects of neuronal epigenomic editing in the CeA using
CRISPR/dCas9-p300, CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB, CRISPR/dCas9-Lsd1 (histone acetylation/methylation), or
CRISPR/dCAS9-Tet1 (DNA methylation mechanism) on AIE-induced changes in gene expression and on
anxiety-like and alcohol drinking behaviors in adult male and female rats. Specific Aim 3 will examine whether
treatment with G9a inhibitor (UNC0642) will normalize epigenetic, gene expression, and dendritic spine changes
in the amygdala and attenuate AIE-induced anxiety-like and alcohol drinking behaviors in adult male and female
rats. Finally, Specific Aim 4 will translate epigenetic dynamics and expression of novel genes that will be
identified from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq in the AIE rat amygdala to post-mortem amygdala of human alcoholics
with early age onset and correlate them to drinking data (daily or weekly ethanol intake). The proposed studies
will provide new information about epigenetic regulation of the whole transcriptome in the amygdala after AIE,
leading to identification of epigenetic targets for drug development for the treatment of adult psychopathology."
10936733,"Project Summary / Abstract:
 Due to the rise of antibiotic resistant tuberculosis and the long treatment time of current anti-tuberculosis
therapies, there is an immediate need for new drug targets against tuberculosis. My lab has identified the
mycobacterial BrkB ortholog as a likely drug target. We have already observed that mutation of mycobacterial
BrkB greatly attenuates growth of our model organism Mycobacterium marinum in its natural host, the zebrafish.
Furthermore, we have observed that this organism is attenuated for growth in both intracellular and extracellular
spaces, making it particularly attractive because extracellular mycobacteria are especially present in late-stage
TB and contribute to TB transmission, and because there is a specific need to target mycobacteria in the
extracellular niche.
 While BrkB is found throughout the bacterial kingdom, the function of BrkB remains elusive. I propose to
characterize the biochemical function of mycobacterial BrkB and resolve its role in virulence by completing the
following three specific aims: (1) Identify mycobacterial BrkB channel substrate(s) and test for protein
interactions, (2) identify mechanism of BrkB extracellular growth requirement, and (3) Measure mycobacterial
BrkB growth under late-stage infection conditions. Towards this end, I have purified recombinant tuberculosis
BrkB from E. coli. In collaboration with Dr. Paul DeCaen (Northwestern Univ.), my students and I will test BrkB
for channel function. My lab has extensive experience with the biochemistry, microbiology, and organismal
biology required to complete aims 1,2, and 3 respectively. With the biophysical expertise of the DeCaen lab, we
collectively share the expertise to solve the role of BrkB in the mycobacterial cell and in the context of infection.
 This project will serve as the foundation of a sustainable research platform that will empower undergraduates
to test independent hypotheses about mycobacterial virulence factors and host susceptibility factors. Students
will have the tools necessary to investigate the biochemical functions of these functions, to work at biosafety
level 2 to investigate mycobacterial cellular biology, and to test their molecular hypotheses at the organismal
level using the zebrafish Mycobacterium marinum model of infection."

In conventional metabolic signaling, secreted protein hormones such as insulin and glucagon elicit metabolic responses in target cells by binding to surface receptors. Recently, a new paradigm of metabolic signaling has emerged, where RNAs act as signaling molecules. For effective intercellular signaling, RNAs (e.g., microRNAs) must be transferred from donor to recipient cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs)—membranous particles released by nearly all cell types. EVs are released from donor cells either through secretion of intraluminal vesicles enclosed in multivesicular bodies/endosomes (exosomes) or by budding from the plasma membrane (microvesicles). When EVs fuse with the surface or endosome of recipient cells, the encapsulated RNAs are delivered into the recipient cell's cytosol, where they regulate gene expression. Previous studies have primarily provided evidence of EV-dependent RNA signaling through the deletion of RNAs from EVs and the inhibition of EV release from donor cells. However, these studies have not demonstrated the critical role of EV fusion with recipient cells, leaving open the possibility that metabolic responses might be triggered by non-RNA molecules co-purified with EVs or present on the EV surface. In this pilot project, we will conduct biochemical and genetic experiments to identify proteins crucial for EV-mediated delivery of adipose microRNAs into liver cells, with a focus on noncanonical proteins that have been overlooked in previous research. If such proteins are identified, we will develop genetic strategies to test whether EV fusion-mediated RNA delivery is necessary for metabolic signaling between adipocytes and liver cells. These pilot studies are expected to provide insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases associated with RNA signaling and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics."
10936738,"There is a critical need to generate age- and sex-specific survival curves to characterize chronological aging and
develop new biochemical and omic methods to describe biological age consistently across NHPs used in
biomedical research. Without accurate measures of chronological and biological aging, it is impossible to make
inferences into genetic, demographic, or physiological variables driving differences in NHP lifespan. The
Nonhuman Primate Lifespan Project (NPLP) now includes data on >110,000 individual NHPs from 59 species
across 15 research institutions that will be leveraged to identify demographic, clinical, and molecular biomarkers
of aging and lifespan. The first aim of this proposal will generate the most accurate and comprehensive
characterization of sex-specific lifespan and age-at-death distributions to date for 11 biomedically-relevant
species, including chimpanzees, baboons, vervets, four species of macaques, marmosets, tamarins, titi
monkeys, and squirrel monkeys. It will test the influence of energetic trade-offs including body size, age at
reproductive maturity, and number of offspring (in females) on lifespan across species. Aim 2 will identify shared
and species-specific patterns of biological aging across 15,000 NHP lifespans based on a deficit accumulation
index (DAI) generated from clinical blood chemistries collected annually to test if longer lifespans within and
between species are associated with increased physiological disruption later in life and a slower pace of
biological aging as characterized by a lower trajectory of deficit accumulation. This aim will focus on the most
used species for translational human aging studies: baboons, vervets, rhesus macaques, and marmosets. With
the lifespan and healthspan data generated in the first two aims, animals will be selected showing contrasting
patterns of pace of biological aging and lifespan. Aim 3 will identify omic biomarkers that differentiate
exceptionally long-lived animals to characterize pathways mediating health and lifespan differences within and
between species. This will leverage existing sequence data in 2700 pedigreed NHPs to identify rare and common
genetic variants associated with lifespan, healthspan, and pace of aging within species. Evolutionary
conservation of the implicated genes across 77 primate species, including humans, will identify genes selected
for longevity in each clade. Finally, longitudinal untargeted plasma proteomic data will be generated in 48 animals
with extreme or median longevity from each of the four species (a total of 576 plasma proteomes). This data will
be used to identify the underlying biology driving differences in longevity within and between species including
pace of aging as characterized in Aim 2. It is hypothesized that while individual genomic and proteomic variants
driving longevity may be specific to one species or clade, when taken together, the variants will coalesce to
highlight a limited number of biological pathways for potential intervention. Collectively, these aims will identify
energetic burdens (growth, reproduction), physiological maintenance (biological aging, proteomics), and innate
risk (genomics) that drive differences in longevity across NHP clades."
10937006,"Project Summary Abstract
The vast diversity in lifespans among organisms provides a remarkable natural experiment in which to explore the
evolutionary innovations that have shaped the extensive variation of this phenotype. Non-human primates represent
a critical taxon for understanding the evolution of human lifespan due to their close phylogenetic proximity and broad
range of lifespans. One key hallmark of aging is genomic instability and the accumulation of somatic mutations. Only
recent improvements in the accuracy of genome sequencing have enabled the study of these mutations in aging
tissues. A subset of these mutations confer growth advantages driving carcinogenesis, however emerging evidence
also highlights their role in several other age-associated diseases and potentially aging itself. We recently
demonstrated that somatic mutation rates are inversely correlated with lifespan in mammals, consistent with a
potential causal role in aging. Furthermore, comparative genomics analyses we and others have performed across
species with diverse lifespans have determined that DNA repair genes are key players in adaptations to long life. Here,
we propose to characterize somatic mutational landscapes of aging in primate species spanning 70 million years of
evolution. These maps will be generated across 10 tissue types from a collection of marmosets, macaques, baboons,
chimpanzees and humans of diverse ages and both sexes using ultra-accurate NanoSeq mutation profiling. For a subset
of tissues we will also perform PacBio long read sequencing to assess somatic structural variants. These data will be
supplemented with NanoSeq profiling of several cell types from 17 additional primate species. Together, these maps
will allow us to ascertain how somatic mutational processes, including mutation rates and signatures, vary with age
across primate species with diverse life spans and life histories. As a result of these somatic mutations as we age many
tissues also become colonized by clonal expansions of positively selected mutant cells. To determine how these clonal
dynamics relate to species lifespan we will next perform deep targeted-NanoSeq on 250 genes, known to drive clonal
expansions in humans, across individuals of different ages from 8 of the aforementioned species. These analyses will
permit identification of the mutations driving clonal expansions, the rate at which these expansions occur during aging,
and spatial clonal dynamics across the lifespan in diverse species and tissues, informing our understanding of how they
contribute to aging. Finally, we will seek to identify the species-specific genetic determinants of these somatic
mutation phenotypes. We will perform a phylo-GWAS analysis to identify the genes associated with differences in
mutational patterns among species using both general phenotypes (e.g. lifespan, body size) as well as the molecular
mutational phenotypes identified in aims 1 and 2 (e.g. mutation rates, spectra, and clonal dynamics). These
comparative genomics approaches will allow us to link both broad primate phenotypes and quantified molecular
phenotypes to the evolutionary innovations that have impacted lifespan in the primate clade. Together these multi-
scale evolutionary comparisons will reveal factors that contribute to the diversity of life spans across primates and to
ultimately identify novel targets for interventions to extend human health span."
10937471,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) currently affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, 80% of whom are male,
and is characterized primarily by impaired social interaction/communication. Prenatal exposure to air pollution
has been implicated in the etiology of ASD, as well as many other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the
mechanisms by which air pollution alters the development of social circuits in the brain remains unknown.
Importantly, there are large social disparities in environmental toxin exposure whereby marginalized communities
bear the greatest burden of exposure. Using a novel mouse model that combines an environmental toxin (diesel
exhaust particles; DEP) with an ethologically relevant maternal stressor (resource deprivation; MS), our
preliminary data show that these exposures in combination, but neither alone, induce robust deficits in social
interaction in male, but not female offspring. This is line with a model in which maternal psychosocial stress
unmasks vulnerability to environmental toxins in offspring. ASD is increasingly recognized as a whole-body
disorder. Gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in the composition of the gut microbiome are present in more
than 50% of individuals with ASD. Studies using animal models suggest a causal link between the gut
microbiome and social behavior, but this has not been studied in the context of environmental toxins. In Aim 1
of this proposal, we will test whether cross-fostering of DEP/MS pups at birth can prevent shifts in the gut
microbiome (assessed using metagenomic sequencing). The dopamine system supports social interaction, is
sensitive to microbial signaling, and my preliminary data suggests is down-regulated following DEP/MS
exposure. Thus, in Aim 2, we will test whether activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway is sufficient
to restore social behavior following DEP/MS. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine whether changes in the gut
microbiome are responsible for changes in social behavior and dopamine signaling in DEP/MS offspring.
Moreover, we will use the metagenomic data gathered in Aim 1 to ask what potential metabolites or molecular
mechanisms might be altered following DEP/MS. Finally, we will ask whether microglia, the resident immune
cells of the brain, play a key role in mediating these microbiome-driven changes. Together, these experiments
will elucidate the ways in which pollutants and stress synergize to produce dysregulation of the gut-brain axis
and deficits in social behavior. This proposal will significantly advance my career development by helping me to
launch my independent research career and the preliminary data obtained herein will serve as a foundation for
future R01 funding."
10933727,"Toxic contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic compounds, pose serious health threats to sur-
rounding communities. Bioremediation, which uses living organisms such as bacteria to degrade, detoxify, or
remove pollutants, has emerged as an environmentally sustainable approach to cleaning up polluted sites. The
Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella is capable of reducing metals like uranium and chromium to less-toxic
forms as well as of degrading organic compounds through redox reaction as part of their anaerobic respiration.
Leveraging the anaerobic respiration mechanism in Shewanella can thus revolutionize bioremediation and
wastewater treatment technologies. The biological foundation of this anaerobic respiration is the extracellular
electron transfer (EET) process, in which the bacterium exchanges electrons with extracellular electron accep-
tors or donors by employing a cascade of proteins residing at different cellular compartments, in which CymA,
an inner-membrane-anchored protein, acts as a central hub of EET pathways for relaying electrons across the
inner-membrane, either toward outside the cell or into the cell. Little is known, however, on how the involved
proteins, especially those at different cellular compartments, coordinate spatially and temporally in the cell to
ensure efficient electron transfer. The long-term goal here is to understand how electroactive bacteria carry out
EET to provide knowledge to better utilize or engineer such bacteria for bioremediation of contaminated sites.
The objective here is to define how CymA coordinates spatially and temporally with its redox partners to mediate
efficient EET across the cell envelope in live Shewanella oneidensis cells. Preliminary studies reveal that CymA
changes its spatial distribution in the cell from a dispersed pattern into a punctate pattern when actively engaged
in EET, which leads to our hypothesis that CymA and its redox partners dynamically cluster and colocalize spa-
tiotemporally in the cell to ensure efficient electron transfer across the cell envelope. The research will test this
hypothesis and use quantitative single-molecule/single-cell imaging approaches, together with specific protein
tagging, genetic manipulations, single-cell (photo)electrochemical manipulation/measurements, and bulk bio-
chemical assays. There are two aims: 1) Define the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of CymA in the cell
in relation to cell's EET activity. 2) Define the spatiotemporal pattern of periplasmic EET partners and their colo-
calization with CymA in the cell. The research is significant because it will provide insights into the mechanism
of EET across the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and the molecular basis of anaerobic respiration in
electroactive bacteria, and it will provide knowledge to potentially engineer S. oneidensis and other electroactive
bacteria for bioremediation applications. The research is innovative because of the novel mechanism of spatio-
temporal colocalization of EET proteins, as well as of the innovative combination of single-cell/molecule fluores-
cence microscopy, electrochemical manipulation, and photoelectrochemical microscopy."

The world’s population is aging, which brings about huge scientific challenges. Since the biological process of
aging is by far the greatest risk factor for most chronic diseases, understanding the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which aging leads to these conditions is of vital importance to increase the health span of older
adults. Aging results in several structural and functional changes in the immune system and is clinically
associated with increases in the frequency and severity of infectious diseases and incidences of cancer,
chronic in inflammatory disorders, and autoimmunity. This general dysregulation in immune system function is
referred to as immunesenescence. Immunosenescence is a multifactorial and dynamic complex phenomenon,
which is shown as a lengthy adjusting and remodeled process existing in immune system during lifespan.
However, the mechanisms under-lying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely
understood. This proposal investigates a new perspective on immune cell markers and function with age
across NHP species with differing lifespans. In addition, we will examine the relationship between immune
aging and neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition and compare these relationships across the NHP
species. These studies will help determine the role the immune system plays in longevity, neurodegeneration
and cognitive decline, which may allow researchers to develop and test immuno-restorative approaches with
the goal of improving longevity in humans."

The Training in Oncology Population Sciences (TOPS) T32 program trains postdoctoral fellows to conduct
research at the T3 and T4 interface to translate knowledge from the laboratory and clinical trials into practice
and population health to reduce the burden of cancer. The need for translational research at the T3 and T4
interface stems from persistent disparities in cancer outcomes and implementation gaps between what is
possible in the context of clinical trials and what happens in routine practice. The TOPS program trains 3
postdoctoral fellows each year in collaboration with 31 faculty from across the 7 institutions of the Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Training provides fellows with the skills necessary to address the challenges
and opportunities brought about by the tremendous growth in the complexity of cancer care, precision
medicine, electronic health records, mobile health, machine learning and data sharing. The TOPS program has
3 strategies to achieve this overarching objective: 1) training in core methods and skills necessary for
investigation through coursework and participation in regular seminars, workshops and reading; 2) intensive
focus on a research project with close mentorship; and 3) training in professional and career development
skills that are a prerequisite for investigation including project development, grant writing, presentation, building
and working with diverse teams, running a dry laboratory, and the responsible conduct of research.
The TOPS T32 is a continuation of the successful R25CA092203 Program in Cancer Outcomes Research
Training (PCORT), which trained 52 pre- and post-doctoral fellows between 2002 and 2017. Funded as a T32
since 2017, TOPS is co-led by Dr. Nancy Keating, a primary care physician, and Dr. Jennifer Mack, a pediatric
oncologist. TOPS trains postdoctoral students with degrees in the fields of medicine, nursing, behavioral
science, pharmacy, economics, clinical epidemiology, health policy, informatics, and engineering for careers
dedicated to cancer-focused population science. The core of the program is a group of 31 faculty mentors
(inclusive of the co-PIs) and 14 emerging mentors with expertise in 1) qualitative research, survey research,
and patient-reported outcomes; 2) observational studies and comparative effectiveness; 3) intervention
studies; 4) clinical informatics, mHealth/eHealth, machine learning, and AI; 5) health policy, economics and
decision science; 6) implementation science; 7) health equity; and 8) computational biology. At the end of the
two-year training, TOPS program participants are well-equipped with the skills necessary to launch
independent research careers in cancer-focused population science and have access to the core resources of
the DF/HCC and the Harvard Catalyst program for translational research training. The TOPS co-directors and
are supported by a 6-member Steering Committee that includes leaders from each of the 7 institutional

10938189,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
DNA encodes all of the information required to generate and maintain each cell within the body. However, DNA
alone is not sufficient and requires the genome to be labeled as active or inactive in a process termed epigenetics
by modifications to DNA itself or to histones around which all DNA is wrapped. These epigenetic modifications
are well established regulators of cellular development and differentiation, and their function is essential for
proper retinal development. While modifications to histone tails such as acetylation and methylation have been
extensively studied, we have not yet explored the roles of histone variants in the retina. In fact, histone H3 has
two isoforms H3.1/2 and H3.3, which are incorporated in a cellular replication dependent and independent
manner respectively. Recent evidence has emerged that mutations within H3.3 cause syndromic disorders,
which include severe neurodevelopmental issues, including in some cases retina degeneration and vision loss.
In this proposal, we aim to investigate the role of H3.3 in retinal cell fate specification and differentiation. We
have preliminary evidence that a mouse model lacking H3.3 in the developing eye causes loss of a subset of
retinal cell types. Additional data suggests H3.3 deposition is tightly regulated early in development to control
expression of an essential subset of genes. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will complete a full phenotypic
characterization of retinal development upon loss of H3.3 from retinal progenitors and post-mitotic neurons. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular role of H3.3 in the establishment of the mature retinal epigenome. The
results of this study will deliver the first in depth investigation of retinal phenotype after depletion of H3.3 and
define the role of H3.3 in retinal epigenetic remodeling and homeostasis. A better understanding of the role of
H3.3 in the retina is essential to better understand retinal development and for the design of treatment paradigms
for patients with H3.3 mutations."
10939182,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the forces that shape patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation in populations is a
central goal of evolutionary biology. Within a biomedical context, this translates to questions like: Why
are some individuals more susceptible to disease? Or why do some naturally age “better” and live longer?
Answering these questions is a crucial step toward true personalized medicine, and would pave the way
for intervention strategies and treatments that could transform how we approach human health. However,
efforts to answer these questions are often hampered by difficulties associated with inferring past and
present selective pressures, and differentiating between the consequences of selection, genetic drift, and
demographic shifts. Here experimental evolution offers a path forward. By studying evolution in real-time
in controlled environments, we are able to directly test hypotheses about how evolutionary forces shape
trait variation. The adaptive changes we observe also provide key mechanistic insights into the biology
underlying observed differences – a fact that is especially valuable in experiments where selection targets
health-relevant traits. In sexually reproducing systems that mirror human populations, we find that
adaptation is typically fueled by standing genetic variation and involves hundreds of genes. Taken
together, these findings suggest there is abundant functional genetic variation segregating for most
complex traits and recent selection significantly impacts patterns of phenotypic variation. However,
moving beyond the findings that “standing genetic variation facilitates rapid adaptation” and “complex
traits are highly polygenic” has been difficult. While we routinely use experimental evolution to identify
genes associated with specific phenotypes, we lack the ability to validate and explore their functions in
mass. As such, efforts to generate deeper biological insights have seen limited success. The Phillips Lab
is seeking to address this by incorporating molecular phenotyping and metabolomics into the
experimental evolution framework. Using metabolomic profiling and 3-dimensional electron microscopy,
we are working to understand the factors that drive differences in rates of senescence using
experimentally evolved fruit fly populations with radically different aging and life-history patterns. We are
also working to establish a new experimental system to study variation in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
By subjecting fruit fly populations to high-sugar diets for generations, we will effectively create populations
enriched for sugar-tolerant individuals. And by collecting genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data
from them as they evolve, we will decipher how the relationships between these levels of biological
organization shape this phenotype. As a whole, the proposed projects all aim to improve our
understanding of the factors underlying common trait variation in real populations."
11042024,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new long-acting 􀁸ormulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese
women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill,"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).
The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, and safety of this new
contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2"

 Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-system fibrotic disease characterized by hard, thickened (fibrotic) skin and
involvement of multiple internal organs, significantly impacting morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The
pathogenesis of SSc is complex, with contributions from genetic predisposition, striking female predominance,
associated vascular alterations (vasculopathy), immune system dysregulation, and aberrant tissue fibrosis.
Using single-cell sequencing, we have observed that both myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergoing
endothelial-mesenchymal transition (endo-MT) are the primary source of type I collagen in SSc skin and primarily
interact with a subset of myeloid cells (LAMP3+ dendritic cells. We further identified Hippo signaling, an
evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway implicated in female-biased autoimmunity through the vestigial like
3 (VGLL3) transcriptional co-regulator, through both direct inhibition and siRNA targeting, as an upstream
regulator of both fibroblast-to-myofibroblast and endothelial-to-endo-MT transition in SSc skin. This forms the
basis of our central hypotheses that LAMP3+ DC – stromal cell interactions drive myofibroblast and endo-
MT transition underlying fibrosis in SSc skin through modulation of Hippo signaling. We will address this
hypothesis through three specific aims, with aim 1 to mechanistically dissect the role of the Hippo-signaling
pathway in both endo-MTs and myofibroblasts, aim 2 to assess the role of the sex-biased transcriptional co-
factor VGLL3, which regulates the Hippo pathway at the nuclear level, and aim 3 to address LAMP3+ DCs, which
secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and is the primary immune cell subsets interacting with Endo-MTs and
myofibroblast in SSc skin. This proposal will address a novel pathway in SSc pathogenesis, assess cross-talk
with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic immune function, and assess the contribution of the sex-biased regulator
VGLL3 in the process. Thus, this work may add to our understanding of SSc pathogenesis and the biological
processes that drive the marked female bias observed in SSc."
10905148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanochemistry and mechanobiology are rapidly advancing fields that aim to understand and leverage the
effects of mechanical forces on multiple hierarchical length scales. Understanding the mechanical structure-
function relationships of biomolecules, cells and tissues is at the core of mechanobiology and recent evidence
shows that mechanical responses across all hierarchical scales are altered in many diseases. While initially
focused on fundamental mechanisms and the necessary method development, the knowledge gained is
increasingly utilized for the development of targeted materials for tissue engineering and the methods developed
laid the foundation for the entirely new field of mechanodiagnostics and mechanotherapeutics. Along the same
lines, a key focus of mechanochemistry is on understanding how synthetic molecules respond to forces and how
this response leads to emergent material properties. The knowledge gained is increasingly harnessed for the
bottom-up design of materials with tunable mechanical properties, self-reporting and self-healing capabilities as
well as sensor and/or actuator function. In coming years, exciting new research is expected to emerge at the
interface of mechanochemistry and mechanobiology that will ultimately allow for integrating smart synthetic
materials with living systems.
This GRC and its associated GRS aim to bridge research on fundamental mechanisms with emerging
applications that exploit mechanochemical and mechanobiological processes, with a strong focus on
biomedical applications as well as new multifunctional (bio)materials.
This GRC/GRS brings together researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, such as biology,
(bio)chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science to foster collaboration and innovation. Catalyzing
cross-disciplinary scientific exchange, the GRC/GRS will establish common principles, critical questions and
specific objectives at the intersection of mechanobiology and mechanochemistry. This effort will propel the
transformation of fundamental insights into a multifaceted array of applications dedicated to enhancing human
health. We aim to reach these goals via three specific aims: (1) The GRC/GRS will provide a platform for
presenting unpublished data across a wide range of emerging topics and promote interdisciplinary discussion
and international collaboration between all participants. (2) It will foster the career development and enhance the
visibility of early career researchers through contributed talks and highly engaged poster sessions as well as the
availability of partial meeting support. (3) We strive to enhance the diversity of participants with a focus on women
and attendees from underrepresented minorities, facilitating and promoting both invited and contributed oral
presentations from these groups. We strongly believe that the scientific environment created at this GRC/GRS
will advance research at the intersection between mechanochemistry and mechanobiology in order to develop
and improve strategies to better understand, diagnose and treat diseases with altered mechanoresponses."

 Neonicotinoids are synthetic nicotine derivatives that act as systemic neurotoxicants. They are used in
large-scale agricultural systems, in private home gardens, and as veterinary pharmaceuticals. The use of
neonicotinoid insecticides is rapidly increasing as they continue to replace known dangerous organophosphate
and methylcarbamate insecticides. Their ubiquitous and rapidly increasing use results in chronic exposure of
non-target species including humans, fish, birds, and pollinators. Despite their rising popularity, the literature is
devoid of studies that evaluate neonicotinoid toxicity in non-target species, especially regarding reproductive
function. Imidacloprid and two metabolites have been identified in the rat ovary 6 hours post dosing and reach
peak concentrations at 12 hours post dosing. It is unknown whether these metabolites reach the ovary via the
vasculature or whether the ovary has the metabolic machinery to metabolize the parent compound. Some
negative effects of imidacloprid on the ovary have been demonstrated in vivo including morphological
abnormalities of ovarian follicles, changes in plasma hormone concentrations, and evidence of oxidative stress
in ovarian cells. Beyond these pathologic endpoints, little is known about the mechanisms through which IMI or
its metabolites cause ovarian toxicity. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that imidacloprid causes
ovarian follicle toxicity via acetylcholine pathways and the ovary itself contributes to this ovotoxicity using its
metabolic machinery. Aim 1 will characterize the toxic endpoints of imidacloprid and relevant imidacloprid
metabolites through changes in gene expression and steroidogenesis in ovarian follicles in vitro. Aim 2 will
determine whether the ovary has the metabolic machinery to metabolize imidacloprid. Aim 3 will determine the
role that acetylcholine pathways play in imidacloprid-induced ovarian toxicity. Collectively these experiments will
provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of imidacloprid and its metabolites on both immature and mature
ovaries, with a focus on mechanism and the identification of ovarian metabolic machinery and acetylcholine
pathways. Through the completion of these experiments and other actives outlined in the research training plan,
the applicant will learn state of the art research techniques, develop technical writing skills, and create a strong
network of reproductive biologists, toxicologists, and veterinary clinicians."

The National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) comprises of nearly 3,000 local
health departments (LHDs) across the United States. NACCHO strives to protect and improve the health of
all Americans by assisting and engaging LHDs in promoting national public health policy, developing
resources and programs, seeking health equity, and supporting effective local public health practice and
systems. An integral piece of this mission is devoted to food safety, achieved through NACCHO's promotion
around the role of LHDs in food safety regulation and contributing toward an integrated food safety system,
in collaboration with federal and partner agencies. NACCHO's proposal will be accomplished by
collaborating with the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) and coordinating with the Retail Food Safety
Regulatory Association Collaborative (Collaborative). The Collaborative members have submitted a
coordinated set of funding applications, including constant ongoing coordination between the associations
across the proposed projects. NACCHO's and CFP's proposed three-year initiative lays out the six aims of
the Collaborative to advance state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) retail food protection programs and
reduce foodborne illness. These include the following aims led by NACCHO and CFP: (1) improve the
approach, competency, and food safety culture in the regulatory community; (3) increase enrollment,
engagement, and conformance in the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards
(Program Standards); and (4) increase the number of establishments that have well-developed and
implemented Food Safety Management Systems (FSMS). The aims will be achieved through Collaborative
workgroup efforts, environmental scans, key informant interviews, focus groups, establishing a Retail Food
Alliance, quantitative and qualitative research methods, educational curriculum/training development, and
utilizing communication channels to communicate the Collaborative's joint messages and resources. The
Retail Food Safety Advisory Group (SLTT program representatives from diverse geographical locations and
jurisdictional sizes) and Collaborative will inform the three-year initiative to provide direction and feedback
on project activities. Under the guidance of these groups and FDA, NACCHO, and CFP will develop tools
and resources essential for SLTTs to improve retail food safety programs and reduce foodborne illness. The
plan will also allow NACCHO and CFP to share strategies on successful adoption of the latest Food Code
editions, implementation of effective intervention strategies, application of effective risk-based inspection
methods, conformance to the Program Standards, and other Collaborative efforts based on the endeavors
of innovative leaders engaged through this initiative."

 The proposal in this application outlines a five-year training program for the development of a career as a
physician-scientist in neonatal neuroimmunology. Candidate, Dr. Maide Ozen, is an Early Stage Investigator and
an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The proposed research
will be carried out under the primary mentorship of Dr. Lauren L. Jantzie, PhD, an expert leader in translational
investigations in perinatal brain injury. Candidate’ s co-mentors are Dr. Shenandoah Robinson, M.D. an expert
in oligodendrocyte biology and Dr. Frances J. Northington, M.D. an esteemed Neonatologist and a leader in cell
death pathways in the brain. Specific training objectives of this K08 proposal are: develop Dr. Ozen’s scientific
and professional skills in 1) advanced neuroimmunology and neuroscience techniques, 2) gene-protein
interactions specific to Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to lay the foundation for a future R01 application.
Neuroscience research at JHU is exceptionally strong. Dr. Ozen and her mentoring committee have developed
a focused approach to achieve these objectives. The experiential research environment, intellectual guidance
and carefully selected didactic courses, each matched to a specific aim in this proposal, will ensure rigorous
training in neuroimmunology for achieving independence.
 White matter injury (WMI) is the most common form of brain injury in preterm neonates. Key focus of
candidates proposed project is interrogating HO-1 pathway, for the first time, in perinatal WMI. HO-1 is an anti-
inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective enzyme with essential roles in immune regulation and is
expressed in mononuclear cells, microglia and oligodendrocytes. The candidate is the first to show that
chorioamnionitis-induced perinatal alterations of HO-1 pathway in the developing rat brain correlate with
neuroinflammation. Therefore, utilizing a validated CHORIO model of Cerebral Palsy, the candidate will first
determine how CHORIO alters HO-1 pathway in WMI; second, determine if intracellular HO-1 expression in
peripheral mononuclear cells and brain microglia differentially contribute to WMI in CHORIO; third, determine if
modulation of HO-1 pathway will protect from WMI in CHORIO. Completion of the targeted career development
program and research proposed in this proposal will allow the candidate to learn new technical skills and gain
neuroscience expertise to excel as a physician-scientist in neuroimmunology and advance the field of HO-1
biology to perinatal brain injury. Rigorous inquiry in regulation of HO-1 pathway in CHORIO could provide
discovery of novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutic strategies for perinatal immune-mediated WMI."
10907554,"Project Abstract
Anal cancer risk is 80-fold higher among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV compared to the
general population, making MSM a critical population for implementing evidence-based anal cancer prevention
interventions. A randomized controlled trial at 21 clinical sites in the United States of people living with HIV,
recently established treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) as an evidence-based
intervention (EBI) for anal cancer prevention. Given its established efficacy, HSIL screening and treatment
should be implemented as prophylactic care to prevent anal cancer in low- and middle-income country (LMIC)
settings where HIV is highly prevalent. To accelerate adoption of HSIL screening and treatment in LMIC settings,
we will leverage an existing HIV infrastructure, the TRUST clinic, an MSM-friendly facility in Nigeria that has
been providing HIV care to a cohort of MSM since 2012. We conducted a proof-of-concept anal cancer screening
and treatment study at the TRUST clinic and found high uptake in the MSM community; representativeness, as
those screened had similar prevalence of HIV and high-risk human papillomavirus as our overall cohort; and
overall patient satisfaction. Despite high screening volumes, we under-detected and under-treated HSIL.
Knowledge gaps in HSIL screening and treatment among both the care team and the participants were identified
as major barriers that impeded implementation of the EBI with fidelity. The objective of the proposed Integrated
Model for the Prevention of Anal Cancer using screen and Treat for HSIL (IMPACT) study is to address these
barriers while capitalizing on facilitators within the existing TRUST clinic infrastructure to create an enhanced
training on Screening and Treatment of HSIL (e-STH) intervention. To achieve this goal, in AIM 1, we will use
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and mixed methods to identify barriers and
facilitators to usual training on the EBI at the TRUST clinic. In AIM 2, we will engage an implementation team to
co-design the e-STH intervention by matching the barriers identified with CFIR with specific strategies in the
Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) framework. We will then take an iterative
improvement approach to test and refine the implementation of the e-STH intervention based on specific
outcomes. In AIM 3, we will conduct a prospective study to evaluate the reach, efficacy, and implementation and
explore the sustainability of e-STH compared to usual training using the RE-AIM framework. The proposed
IMPACT study will provide insight into implementation of an HSIL screening and treatment EBI adapted for
existing community-based HIV clinics in Nigeria and generate essential evidence for scalability across LMICs."
10905489,"Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is a herpesvirus known to cause long-term morbidities in the eye and
serious vision problems. In our previously funded period, we discovered the high efficacy, unique mode of action,
pharmacokinetics, safety, and superior antiviral properties of BX795 against HSV-1 in the eye. Our findings
provided a new understanding of host protein targets involved in HSV-1 infection of the cornea. Through
extensive transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of BX795, we uncovered a novel cell cycle regulatory mode of
action with broader scientific implications beyond its antiviral properties. Due to our extensive studies, BX795
shows strong promise as a new topical antiviral for ocular herpes, and it can now be pursued for Phase 1 clinical
studies. However, our studies also revealed an interesting challenge: BX795 failed to synergistically enhance
other clinically relevant drugs, specifically nucleoside analogs like ACV and TFT, commonly used for ocular HSV-
1 infections. To address the scientific curiosity about whether a functional analog of BX795 can exhibit synergism
with existing antivirals, we utilized our omics data, conducted in silico L1000 assay-based CMap predictions, and
identified another small molecule, GW8150, as the closest functional analog of BX795. Our preliminary data
demonstrated high efficacy, low toxicity, and, to our satisfaction, strong synergy with ACV and TFT. Thus,
GW8150 presents a valuable new tool to study the pathways contributing to HSV-1 infection in the eye,
understand why synergy was absent in BX795, and offer a potential candidate for topical or oral antiviral
development. To achieve our goals, we have defined three specific aims for the competitive renewal period: first,
to determine GW8510's antiviral action and its impact on corneal cells by analyzing Omics data and identifying
interactions with corneal cell proteins and changes in cell proteomes; second, to assess the therapeutic benefits
of topically delivered GW8510 in murine models of ocular HSV-1 infection, establishing it as a potent candidate
for further development as an FDA approved antiviral for ocular indications; and third, to investigate GW8510's
synergistic abilities in reducing ocular HSV-1 infection, potentially in combination with clinically approved drugs,
with the aim of enhancing antiviral efficacy, improving treatment options, and exploiting transcriptomics and
proteomics analyses to uncover the specific targets and pathways that underpin this synergistic antiviral action.
Post-treatment corneal, as well as retinal health and associated vision functions, will be examined to determine
the benefits (and/or any toxic effects) of drug administration. By completing these specific aims, we aim to gain
valuable insights into ocular antiviral mechanisms, new proviral pathways targeted by GW8510, and develop
more effective strategies to combat HSV-1 infections in the eye. This research holds promise for advancing our
understanding and treatment of ocular herpes, improving patient outcomes, and contributing to the development
of novel ocular antiviral therapies."

Arenaviruses are a family of zoonotic RNA viruses that are capable of causing severe hemorrhagic fever disease
in humans. Lassa virus (LASV), an Old World arenavirus which is endemic in regions of West Africa including
Sierra Leone and is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), causes thousands of deaths annually. Arenaviruses
have repeatedly crossed over into humans over the past several decades, and emerging variants of known
arenaviruses often display increased human-to-human transmissibility and broader geographic range. For these
reasons, the CDC and WHO have classified several human arenaviruses as high priority pathogens and the
PREDICT consortium ranked LASV as the highest risk virus on their watchlist of potential pandemic pathogens.
Vaccines and therapeutics against arenaviruses are urgently needed, however, we must first gain a much deeper
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that result in protective humoral immunity. Although the discovery
of effective clinical countermeasures is the ultimate goal, this collaborative project focuses on leveraging
innovative, high-throughput antibody discovery and characterization tools to define the genetic, functional and
structural properties of anti-LASV antibodies with broad specificity across human arenaviruses. We have
assembled a collaborative, multidisciplinary group of investigators with a long history of productive collaboration
in viral immunology and with complementary areas of expertise. Additionally, we have access to a singular cohort
of LF survivors at Kenema Government Hospital, which is located in Sierra Leone and is at the heart of the LF
zone. We expect our work will result in the discovery of thousands of novel anti-LASV antibodies, characterization
of which will reveal conserved sites of viral vulnerability and uncover the precise molecular mechanisms of viral
neutralization. These fundamental studies directly address critical gaps in our understanding of the interplay
between humoral immunity and hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses and will serve as a foundation for future
translational studies."

The overall objective of the R25 Research Education Program(REP) summer experience is to establish an
approach for providing minority students attending USC with the support needed to increase diversity in the field
of biomedical science and aging by providing mentorship and research training opportunities for young URM
biomedical scientists with unique experiences and perspectives. To accomplish this objective, we will: I) use our
already developed and validated innovative strategies to recruit 100 URMs to the different biomedical science
disciplines and aging related research experiences at USC. We will attract these students by conducting
seminars, workshops, and lectures at the USC campuses throughout the academic year. II) Organize a USC
Biomedical Science Forum where 50 URM students from a pool of 100 URMs will be invited for a two-day
orientation during the spring semester. These students will visit USC and its biomedical science programs while
also obtaining information on the ten-week summer REP. III) Provide a 10-week summer educational mentoring
and research opportunity at USC for ten REP students every year for five years. For the summer program, we
will,1) match each REP participant with a mentor to initiate the development of an individual development
plan(IDP), and organize a weekly mentoring activity, 2) organize professional development workshop training for
URMs in aging research, 3) implement a weekly Science/Journal club meeting to discuss publications related
to aging research, 4) organize workshop training in professional development to synergize REP students with
USC training programs in professional development activities allowing networking with other young colleagues,
and 5) provide scientific research for REP students to enhance their research career development in biomedical
sciences and promote graduate school aspirations. Beyond the summer REP, we will provide research and
mentoring opportunities to continue to synergize REP students with USC training programs. By providing
academic support initiatives, including mentoring, professional development activities and training in biomedical
science and aging related research opportunities, we will be able to increase diversity in the field of biomedical
science and aging related research for young URM biomedical scientists. Continued ""mentoring "" of REP students
will go on until they complete their baccalaureate degree in biomedical science and will even continue finally to
their matriculation into graduate programs in biomedical sciences at USC. We expect that 70% of REP students
in their senior years will have research experience, evident in publications (manuscripts and conference
abstracts). The research experience will prepare them for graduate programs, while the publications will make
them competitive for graduate school admission. We plan to increase awareness for at least 60% of URMs,
freshman through senior years in different career opportunities in aging research."
10908468,"Cell encapsulation technologies are poised to improve conventional islet transplantation to more effectively
manage type I diabetes. Currently, lifelong whole-body immunosuppression is administered to avoid immune
rejection of the transplant, despite the associated life-threatening adverse effects. Clinical studies reveal that
transplants eventually fail due to lack of vascular support for nutrients and oxygen supply and host immune
rejection. To address all these critical needs and supported by preliminary studies, we propose the NICHE, an
innovative subcutaneous vascularized encapsulation system with local elution of immunosuppressants to protect
transplanted cells from immune rejection. The NICHE presents dual transcutaneously refillable reservoirs, for
drug and cells, respectively, separated by a nanoporous membrane. Local immunosuppressant delivery confines
drugs to the graft site where immune attack occurs, minimizing exposure to the rest of the body, thus avoiding
systemic immunosuppression and associated adverse effects. The NICHE cell reservoir is fully vascularized with
functional vessels, recreating an ideal physiological environment conducive for maintaining long-term viability
and function of transplanted cells. We hypothesize that the NICHE will provide a vascularized environment
with local immunosuppressant delivery for successful long-term islet engraftment to restore euglycemia
in diabetic hosts. In aim 1, we will study the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to induce vascularization within
the NICHE as well as modulate the NICHE immune microenvironment to be conducive for islet transplantation
in diabetic rats. This will be followed in aim 2 by the biodistribution analysis of immunosuppressants locally eluted
in the NICHE and the assessment of immunomodulation and pharmacokinetics in diabetic rats. In aim 3, the
NICHE efficacy in providing a suitable environment for successful islet engraftment to restore euglycemia in
diabetic rats will be assessed over 1 year, in parallel to a longitudinal study of NICHE microenvironment
remodeling. The proposed studies are based on our team’s extensive expertise in implantable drug and cell
delivery systems, tissue engineering, research and clinical transplantation, transplant immunology, type 1
diabetes, as well as supportive preliminary data and previously published work. Importantly, the NICHE is
designed prioritizing clinical considerations of efficacy, safety and user acceptability. Transcutaneous cell and
drug refilling allow for ease of drug replenishment when needed, thus extending implant lifespan potentially for
the lifetime of patients. Further, the thin and compact size of the NICHE, which is smaller than the encapsulation
implants under clinical investigation, is favorable for user acceptability. Successful completion of the proposed
work will provide a broadly applicable encapsulation system with localized immunosuppressant delivery for long-
term protection of transplanted islets, as well as minimize adverse effects associated with immunosuppressive
drugs. This could translate to a clinical breakthrough for deployment of cell therapies beyond islets, including
stem cell-derived β cells, to treat diabetes as well as other diseases."

promote and enable the broadest and most adept possible use of our PET/MR technologies. PET/MR is a young
modality that is technically complex, with a fast pace of growth in technology development and an increasing number
of sites nationwide. This can result in a hyper-competitive environment where sharing technology among centers is
not the norm. This is the very motivation behind making Training and Dissemination a cornerstone of our CMITT
program to aim at breaking down barriers through cultivating collaborations, providing numerous opportunities for
training physicists, engineers, radiochemists, and clinicians, and supporting avenues of broad dissemination. The
unique opportunity to develop PET/MR technology that is not tied to a specific manufacturer means that CMITT is the
first center, to our knowledge, to have access to both simultaneous PET/MR scanners available on the market today
from Siemens and GE with very strong collaborations in place with both manufacturers. With this Innovation Hub
comes also a unique opportunity for Training and Dissemination to the entire PET/MR community. To achieve this
goal requires a user community that is experienced in the utilization of imaging systems and working with and
interpreting image data sets. Thus, the training and dissemination initiatives are an essential component and
cornerstone of our mission."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new cancers (such as cervical and anal cancer)
caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). An effective vaccine exists that can prevent
these cancers, but uptake of the HPV vaccine is low among young cancer survivors (fewer than 1 in 4 have
received the vaccine). Lack of a healthcare provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine is the most common
reason that cancer survivors fail to get the HPV vaccine. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV
vaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge about the HPV
vaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively recommend the vaccine to young
people and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving the vaccine. This proposed research will evaluate
the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers
in pediatric oncology clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years
of age and at least one year off-therapy). If the intervention is effective in improving and sustaining increased
uptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this study will contribute important information needed to
move forward with testing the widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices. This proposed
research addresses improving healthcare delivery and clinical outcomes for cancer survivors through prevention
of HPV-associated cancers, which are high-priority research areas for the National Cancer Institute."

Addressing Food Insecurity in under-Represented Minorities (AFIRM) is a proposed collaboration
including Health Choice Network (HCN), Jessie Trice Community Health System, Broward
Community and Family Health Centers and other Florida Federally Qualified Health Centers

Community Based Organizations including Feeding South Florida. We propose to catalyze,
deploy, and evaluate community-led structural interventions leveraging multisectoral partnerships
to address food insecurity and ultimately reduce health disparities at HCN FQHCs across Florida.
The first two years will involve planning, capacity and partnership building to develop/pilot
structural interventions to address food insecurity. Structural interventions will address the social,
physical, economic, or political environments that result in food insecurity. The interventions
include developing universal screening for food insecurity for FQHC patients using simple
validated measures of food insecurity built into the EHR. We will then leverage existing and new
relationships to develop structural interventions designed to help all persons who identify as
having food insecurity. In years 3-8 we will implement community-led structural interventions
addressing food insecurity and ultimately assess the impact of these interventions on health
outcomes. Interventions include assisting eligbile patients in applying for state and Federal
programs, linkages to food insecurity resources such as food banks/pantries located proximal to
areas of greatest need (including within the FQHCs) and developing systems to address
transportation barriers. More broadly there will be engagement of state and local policy-makers,
leaders, and health plans in developing programs and policies and community programs to
address food insecurity."

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures composed of an RNA-DNA hybrid and a free single-stranded
DNA. The opened DNA strands may lead to DNA damage; thus, R-loops are a risk factor for genome integrity.
Improper R-loop accumulation contributes to abnormal human development and diseases. In contrast to the
detrimental effects of R-loops, growing evidence suggests that they also regulate gene transcription, mitosis,
and homologous recombination, thus contributing to many fundamental physiological processes. The formation
and resolution of R-loops must be tightly regulated. Therefore, the goal for the next five years of my research is
to investigate the mechanisms by which R-loops epigenetically regulate gene transcription in pluripotency, early
development, and tissue homeostasis. My unpublished work in mouse ESCs (mESCs) strongly suggests that
Zfp281 (human: ZNF281) is an R-loop-dependent transcription factor and recruits Tet1 and Brca2 for DNA
demethylation and DNA damage repair, respectively. We will explore the functions of R-loops as a DNA
epigenetic regulator in the mouse naive-formative-primed pluripotent state transition through pathways that
include Zfp281/Tet1-mediated R-loop formation for gene activation and Zfp281/Brca2-mediated R-loop
resolution for genome stability. In human development, naive human ESCs (hESCs) have a prolonged
developmental plasticity and can differentiate into extraembryonic lineages. My unpublished work showed that
ZNF281 is highly enriched in naive hESCs, with a widespread occupation of Polycomb repressive complex 2
(PRC2) and the repressive histone H3K27me3 mark at the extraembryonic master gene loci (e.g., GATA4,
CDX2). Therefore, we will investigate the effects of R-loops and ZNF281 on PRC2-repressed low-transcription
genes in naive hESCs and their differentiation into the human extraembryonic endoderm and trophectoderm
lineages. Moreover, we will investigate the relationship between DNA damage and genome-wide gains of
ZNF281, PRC2, and H3K27me3 in naive hESCs. And last, we will develop a research program to explore R-
loop functions in tissue homeostasis and in disease settings. We will focus on B-cell homeostasis, as evidence
shows that aberrant accumulation of R-loops accelerates the progression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL), a disease originating from the malignant transformation of B-cells in the germinal center. My
unpublished work showed that B-cell-specific Zfp281 conditional knockout mice had accumulated pre-/pro-B
cells in the bone marrow and had increased IgG1-expressing activated B-cells in the spleen upon immunization.
Using the DLBCL lines and the Zfp281 deficiency mouse model, we will investigate the effects of abnormal R-
loop accumulation induced by Zfp281 deficiency on B-cell development and the progression of B-cell lymphoma.
In summary, we aim to establish a coherent view of regulatory R-loops as DNA and histone epigenetic modifiers,
as well as a potential risk factor if they are not properly resolved, in different cellular systems."

Male breast cancer is critically understudied due to both the rarity of the disease and the exclusion of men
from breast cancer trials leading to a significant knowledge gap about how male breast tumors respond to
therapy. The efficacy of existing endocrine therapies in men with ER+/HER2- breast cancer have never
been compared prospectively, and this is the goal of the ongoing ETHAN trial. In this trial, 60 patients are
randomized to 3 endocrine regimens for a 3-week window phase, followed by biopsy, then a 4-month
neoadjuvant phase +/- the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, followed by surgical resection. The trial is well
powered to compare differences in response rates, measured in the window phase by a 50% reduction in
Ki-67, and in the neoadjuvant phase by residual cancer burden index. This design creates an
unprecedented opportunity for translational studies using samples from pre and post treatment timepoints
annotated with clinically relevant response endpoints. The goal of this proposal is to leverage patient
samples from the ETHAN trial to understand and predict how male breast tumors respond to therapy. We
hypothesize that multigene response signatures will predict response to ET in men with ER+ breast
tumors. To test this hypothesis, in Aim1 we will determine endocrine therapy response signatures using
whole transcriptome sequencing of pre and post treatment specimens. We will determine how each drug
treatment results in changes in gene expression and compare these to female predictors and response
signatures. We will perform stratified analysis of responders and non-responders to discover biomarkers
which will be validated using large cohorts of patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer treated with
endocrine therapy. In Aim2, we will utilize our single cell processing pipeline which we used to show
distinct responses in malignant cell subpopulations within female ER+/HER2- breast tumors, to dissect
heterogeneity in endocrine therapy response within male breast tumors. This analysis will define features
of low abundance cell populations that may be driving the resistance phenotype. Finally, in Aim3, we will
address a critical lack of experimental models of male breast cancer by using our organoid infrastructure
to generate male patient derived organoids. We will use organoids to test estrogen receptor gene
regulatory function and assess the preclinical efficacy of targeted therapeutic strategies. Cumulatively,
these studies will address a significant knowledge gap of why therapies are effective or i neffective in men
with breast cancer. These findings will generate predictors of response, identify pathways driving
resistance, and generate and utilize experimental models to uncover the intrinsic biology of male breast
tumors. If successful, these insights will lead to more precise treatment regimens and improve outcomes
for men with breast cancer."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Veterans with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, are recommended as first-line therapy for the
management of T2D. Unfortunately, the efficacy of these lifestyle interventions for preventing CVD morbidity
and mortality in patients with T2D is not well-established. Available evidence from our group and others
indicates that vascular adaptations to exercise training are impaired in subjects with T2D. We propose that
diminished vascular adaptations explain why increased physical activity does not lead to a robust reduction in
CVD morbidity and mortality in T2D. However, the mechanisms responsible for this deficit in vascular
adaptations to exercise in T2D remain unknown. This is a major limitation for identifying new adjuvant
therapeutics to maximize the cardiovascular benefits of exercise in the diabetic population. Exercise exerts
direct effects on the vasculature via repetitive exposure to hemodynamic stimuli or shear stress. The
increased blood flow and luminal shear stress attendant to each bout of exercise are primary mechanisms
contributing to vascular adaptations. Shear stress is detected by mechanosensitive endothelial luminal
structures, such as the glycocalyx, that convert mechanical forces into biochemical signals via
mechanotransduction. As such, we propose that an intact endothelial glycocalyx is required for the
mechanotransduction of increased shear stress and the subsequent chronic vascular adaptations associated
with exercise to occur. Notably, glycocalyx degradation is a classic feature of T2D. Accordingly, our
overarching hypothesis is that endothelial glycocalyx degradation is a key factor precluding shear stress
mechanotransduction and consequent exercise-induced vascular adaptations in T2D. The corollary to this
hypothesis is that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx by dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors
(DSGP) will improve vascular adaptations to exercise in T2D. Specifically, in Aim 1 (Proof of Concept Clinical
Trial Phase), we will document that DSGP enhances endothelial glycocalyx integrity in patients with T2D.
Although we provide preliminary evidence that DSGP can increase glycocalyx thickness and endothelial
function in a mouse model of T2D, this will be the first study to demonstrate these effects in T2D subjects. The
effects of DSGP for eight weeks will be studied using a double-blinded randomized placebo control trial.
Subsequently, in Aim 2 (Expended Clinical Trial Phase), we will demonstrate the permissive role of the
endothelial glycocalyx in exercise-induced vascular adaptations in patients with T2D. Having shown that
restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx via DSGP is feasible in T2D subjects, we will now investigate whether
such supplementation will potentiate exercise training-induced improvements in endothelial function. This will
be accomplished in a factorial balanced design in which T2D subjects will be randomized to DSGP or placebo
with and without concurrent exercise training for eight weeks. Our team is poised to move cardiovascular and
diabetes research forward with a translational project that will exert a sustained, powerful impact across a
number of levels of inquiry that are novel conceptually, methodologically, and therapeutically. Indeed,
targeting the glycocalyx holds extraordinary promise for achieving optimal exercise-induced vascular
adaptations in Veterans with T2D, thus maximizing the cardiovascular benefits of exercise."

“Childhood Pulmonary and Related Outcomes after Perinatal Exposure to Adjunctive Azithromycin Prophylaxis
for Cesarean Delivery” is a large multi-center non-inferiority follow-up cohort study designed to evaluate long-
term microbiome-mediated childhood pulmonary and gastrointestinal (GI) effects after perinatal exposure to
adjunctive azithromycin as compared with placebo (plus standard cephalosporin) prior to incision to prevent
surgical site infections at cesarean delivery. The parent C/SOAP randomized trial of adjunctive azithromycin
(4/2011–11/2014) demonstrated a significant reduction in maternal infections (endometritis and wound
infection) without any significant effect on short-term neonatal outcomes in the azithromycin group. This
reduction in maternal infection (a major cause of death) was so significant that azithromycin use was found to
be cost-saving – saving ~$360 for each use in unscheduled cesareans, corresponding to $270 million dollars
annually in US healthcare costs. However, enthusiasm for adjunctive azithromycin has been tempered given
reports of changes induced by azithromycin on the newborn gut microbiome (dysbiosis) that may be
associated with immune/inflammatory diseases affecting respiratory and GI function (asthma, wheezing, atopy,
inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]). In September 2018, ACOG suggested “consideration” of adjunctive
azithromycin, but emphasized the need for studies of its effect on microbiome-mediated long-term outcomes.
In this study, we hypothesize that perinatal exposure to adjunctive azithromycin compared to standard
cesarean prophylaxis alone is not associated with increased childhood pulmonary or GI morbidity (i.e. is non-
inferior). We propose a long-term follow-up study of the offspring of the C/SOAP trial cohort at optimal target
age of 7 years (range 6-8) at the 14 sites that participated in the parent C/SOAP trial. We expect at least 1410
of 2013 children (70% follow-up) whose mothers were enrolled in C/SOAP will undergo a single study visit
incorporating assessment of pulmonary and GI health. We will address the following specific aims:
1) To compare the incidence of childhood respiratory morbidity, specifically physiologic pulmonary
 impairment, based on a primary composite outcome of abnormal pulmonary function testing, physician
 diagnosis of asthma, or use of respiratory rescue medications in the previous year at age 7 (range 6-8)
 after perinatal exposure to adjunctive azithromycin versus placebo (standard prophylaxis alone)
2) To compare the incidence of childhood gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity based on a primary composite
 outcome of physician diagnosis of GI disease (eosinophilic esophagitis or IBD) OR an abnormal score on a
 validated GI questionnaire (Rome IV) between cohort offspring aged 7 (range 6-8) after perinatal exposure
 to adjunctive azithromycin versus placebo
This study is the only opportunity to provide long-term safety data from a large US trial to inform and
strengthen the newly recommended use of adjunctive azithromycin for cesarean delivery."
10910980,"The overall aim of this proposed study is to use machine learning prediction models to evaluate the
multifaceted, additive and multiplicative interactions of known and novel risk factors for opioid use disorder
(OUD) and overdose in Post-9/11 Veterans. The proposed study will also investigate the short- and long-term
impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the risk of OUD and overdose.
 TRAINING PLAN: The CDA-2 training plan will facilitate the applicant’s primary career goal of becoming a
fully funded, independent epidemiologic researcher at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with a focus on
addiction and suicidal behavior. The CDA-2 will provide additional training necessary to lead an independent
program of research investigating the multifaceted sociodemographic, physical, psychological, and behavioral
factors mediating and moderating the risk of addiction and suicidal behavior. The first step of achieving this
goal is to complete the following training aims: 1) gaining expertise in the biological and behavioral basis of
addiction; 2) gaining expertise in the assessment of the problems of TBI and blast exposure, psychiatric
disorders, and suicidal behavior, which is pervasive in this generation of Veterans; 3) gaining expertise in
advanced analytic techniques employed in health data science, including machine learning algorithms; and 4)
professional development to achieve career independence as a VA funded epidemiologic researcher.
 RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS: The proposed study will use Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
electronic medical records to develop models predicting OUD and overdose risk. The sample will include Post-
9/11 Veterans who are aged 18-65, receive care in the VHA, and will have completed the VA primary TBI
screen between October 2007 and February 2020 (n~1,267,000). We will assess the risk of incident and
recurrent OUD and overdose events, as separate outcomes, using machine learning algorithmic models. We
will examine whether overdose was 1) fatal and non-fatal and 2) intentional and unintentional. For Aims 1 and
2, we will examine the risk of OUD and overdose events between October 1, 2007 and February 29, 2020. For
Exploratory Aim 3, we will examine the risk of OUD and overdose events between March 1, 2020 and
September 30, 2025. We will use several machine learning classification-tree modeling approaches, including
classification and regression trees, random forest, and gradient boosting, to develop predictor profiles of OUD
and overdose incorporating important risk factors and interactions. The validity (sensitivity and specificity) and
prediction accuracy (area under the curve) will be assessed for all prediction profile models. OBJECTIVES:
Aim 1: Develop and evaluate the performance of predictor profiles incorporating known and novel risk factors
and interactions for OUD and overdose over proximal (30, 60, and 90 days) and distal (180, 365, 730, 1095
and >1460 days) prediction intervals using machine learning classification algorithms. Hypothesis 1a: The
machine learning algorithms will have high validity and prediction accuracy (e.g., sensitivity and specificity and
area under the curve) >0.8. Hypothesis 1b: Accuracy and predictive ability will be higher in the proximal vs.
distal prediction intervals. Aim 2: Examine gender, race/ethnicity, deployment-related trauma (e.g., TBI and
prevalent psychiatric and substance disorders), and close-blast exposure as moderators of the risk of OUD
and overdose. Hypothesis 2: There will be novel risk factors and differential variable importance impacting the
risk of OUD and overdose within the subgroup-specific predictor profiles. Exploratory Aim 3: Investigate the
short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk of OUD and overdose using machine
learning classification algorithms to develop predictor profiles of known and novel risk factors and interactions.
Hypothesis 3: The COVID-19 pandemic will have both a direct effect on the risk for OUD and overdose and an
indirect effect through the onset or exacerbation of mental health symptoms and psychiatric conditions."
10911963,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Zambia, where HIV prevalence is also high (11.3%).
HIV heightens the risk of developing and dying from cervical cancer. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
is a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent 90% of cervical cancers, and is recommended for
girls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low (16%) in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs),
and our team's on-the-ground experience suggests HPV vaccination is even lower in Zambia, particularly
among girls with HIV, who are most at risk of poor cancer outcomes. Currently, HPV vaccination is
delivered via school-based campaigns, which are viewed as efficient for broad coverage but also exclude the
most vulnerable children—those out-of-school or who irregularly attend (e.g., orphans, poor). Adolescents
living with HIV (ALHIV) are more likely to have these additional vulnerabilities. In addition, WHO recommends
ALHIV receive a 3rd dose of the HPV vaccine, which is not given in traditional 2-dose school-based campaigns.
To ensure that ALHIV have access to the WHO-recommended 3-doses, we propose to integrate HPV
vaccination into routine care in adolescent HIV clinics. Adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia have regular
contact with ALHIV and are trusted sources of health information for the community. Given the known
challenges of providing cervical cancer prevention in LMICs, including Zambia (e.g., stigma, misinformation,
staffing, supply chain), integrating HPV vaccination requires a multilevel approach, stakeholder
engagement, and diversified implementation strategies. To achieve success, we will co-design a package
of implementation strategies using a previously successful implementation research approach developed for
cervical cancer prevention in LMICs: the Integrative Systems Praxis for Implementation Research (INSPIRE).
INSPIRE is a novel, formal, and comprehensive framework to develop, implement, and evaluate
implementation science efforts. Following key elements of INSPIRE, our specific aims are to: 1) Identify the
unique multilevel contextual factors (barriers and facilitators) across HIV settings (rural, urban, peri-urban) that
influence HPV vaccine uptake; 2) Use Implementation Mapping to translate stakeholder feedback and findings
from Aim 1 into a package of implementation strategies to integrate HPV vaccine into HIV clinics; 3) Conduct a
Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the package of multilevel implementation
strategies for integrating HPV vaccine into HIV clinics. Our research team has significant expertise in HIV,
HPV, cancer prevention, implementation science, and LMIC research. Wehave strong institutional backing,
including$325,000 over the course of the study;strong support, technical expertise, and resources (e.g.,
vaccines) from the Zambian Ministry of Health; and political will for scale-up. If successful, this
stakeholder-based implementation model could be transported to HIV clinics across Zambia and serve as a
model to address cancer prevention priorities for those with HIV in other LMICs."

There is evidence from human and animal studies that support that imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS), specifically reduced ACE2 protein levels and/or activity, leads to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
Mouse dams and concepti with loss-of-function alleles of ACE2 exhibit increased embryonic loss, reduced fetal
weight, placental hypoxia, and preeclampsia-like phenotypes in dams. While the RAS has been extensively
studied in the kidney and circulation, much less is known about the local uterine and placental RAS early in
pregnancy and if their disruption contributes to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Our proposed collaborative
project will address this need, drawing on my expertise in embryo transfer techniques. The main objective of this
innovative application is to test the hypothesis that ACE2 plays a local role at the maternal-fetal interface
modulating normal placental development and fetal growth independent of the maternal circulating and kidney
RAS. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct in-depth morphological phenotyping, novel RAS protein analyses,
and blood pressure monitoring by radiotelemetry to determine the cell-specific contributions of ACE2 in the
placenta (Aim 1) and decidua (Aim 2). These experiments will elucidate the function of the RAS that are relevant
to idiopathic pregnancy loss and pregnancy complications. Given the known differences between mouse and
human placentas, we will also determine RAS gene expression, protein abundance and localization in rhesus
macaque placentas, which are more structurally similar to human (Aim 3). The Aims outlined in this application
will provide extensive information for the field by improving understanding of the basic RAS function in utero-
placental development during pregnancy. Determining the causes of pregnancy loss, and pregnancy
complications would greatly improve human health, reducing the associated physiological, psychological, and
economic burdens and help us shape advances in maternal-fetal medicine."

This proposal focuses on understanding the healthcare needs of fasting Type 2 diabetic Muslims and
identifying current gaps in the capacity of dietitians to respond to the needs of this population. This study
addresses 3 specific aims: 1) Determine dietitians’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding providing
care to fasting Muslims; 2) Assess the perspectives of Muslims with diabetes regarding the healthcare they
have received concerning how to manage fasting; and 3) Integrate the perspectives of dietitians and Muslims
to inform the development of care guidelines for fasting diabetic Muslims. The research design uses a cross
sectional survey to assess dietitians' knowledge, attitude, and practices to provide care to fasting Muslims;
focus groups with dietitians to explore the barriers, challenges, and opportunities dietitians experience while
providing culturally sensitive care; and in-depth interviews with diabetic Muslims to understand their healthcare
experiences related to managing fasting. Aim 3 will involve the comparison of data collected during Aims 1 and
2 to determine a) whether Muslims’ healthcare experiences align with or diverge from dietitians’ perception of
their capacity to provide culturally safe care and b) support the development of an overall conceptual
framework. This proposal aligns with the NIH mission by engaging in research focused on enhancing the
health and reducing illness and disability among fasting diabetic Muslims."

leveraging our work in ultra-scalable and record-low power nanoelectronics, which can lead to
beyond-Silicon dimensional scalability to create sub-cellular sized and highly energy-efficient

different surface functionalization and synthetic biology techniques to achieve the required
targeting. This supplement will extend our technology to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Current AD
therapies only provide marginal symptomatic benefits due to inability to achieve early intervention
and as irreversible neuron loss occurs after cognitive impairment. Pathological neuroinflammation,
tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregations, which are hallmarks of AD, start in small brain regions. We
will leverage our technology of wireless subcellular sized nanoelectronics to target these
pathological sites associated with AD for highly precise therapeutics. Our technology can provide
the advantages of early-stage intervention which can be instrumental to slow down and even
prevent development of AD. The proposed supplementary work is well within the scope of the
parent award and will lead to future R01-funded research on novel AD therapeutics."

Skeletal muscle shows amazing plasticity and has the capacity to continuously regulate its size in response to
external cues such as mechanical load, neural activity, hormones, growth factors, and nutritional status. The
maintenance of muscle mass is controlled by a balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation
pathways, a balance that shifts toward protein degradation during atrophy and protein synthesis during
hypertrophy. To date, protein synthesis and degradation systems have been extensively studied in the context
of muscle growth and wasting, while work to identify and characterize novel modulators of muscle hypertrophy
and atrophy has been less prolific. As an example, the MAP kinase signaling pathway has been found to play
an array of roles in skeletal muscle ranging from the regulation of fiber type development to controlling protein
synthesis and autophagy pathways. Interestingly, gene expression analysis of muscle tissue isolated from mice
following denervation revealed that Dusp4, a known negative regulator of MAP kinase signaling, is significantly
upregulated. Further, previous studies suggest that Dusp4 preferentially regulates the Erk1/2 branch of the MAP
kinase signaling cascade in skeletal muscle. While Dusp4 is rapidly and robustly upregulated in response to
sciatic nerve transection, the functional consequence of upregulation of this dual-specificity phosphatase during
neurogenic skeletal muscle atrophy remains unclear. Therefore, the overall objective of this investigation is to
characterize the functional role of Dusp4 in modulating the molecular mechanisms that regulate muscle size and
strength and determine how Dusp4 contributes to changes in muscle mass. This objective will be accomplished
through the completion of the following specific aims. In aim 1, we will determine if Dusp4 expression is
necessary and sufficient to induce muscle atrophy using in vivo electroporation of skeletal muscle to knockdown
or overexpress Dusp4 for 3- and 14-days followed by measurement of muscle weight, myofiber cross sectional
area, fiber type composition, and expression levels of markers of protein synthesis and atrophy. We hypothesize
that knockdown of Dusp4 in denervated muscles will attenuate muscle atrophy, while overexpression of Dusp4
will promote skeletal muscle wasting. In aim 2, we will explore the hypothesis that Dusp4-mediated
dephosphorylation may serve as a signal to alter the activity, localization, and/or stability of putative substrates
in muscle. This hypothesis will be tested using an in vivo overexpression approach combined with an unbiased
phosphoproteomic analysis to identify and validate the full complement of Dusp4 targets in skeletal muscle. The
successful completion of this project will demonstrate for the first time that Dusp4 acts as a regulator of skeletal
muscle mass through modulation of the Erk1/2 branch of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Furthermore, if the
findings of this investigation demonstrate that Dusp4 participates in the neurogenic atrophy cascade by acting
as a direct or indirect modulator of muscle wasting, then inhibition of this dual-specificity phosphatase could
prove beneficial in the treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy associated with neuromuscular disorders,
neurodegenerative diseases, and aging."

 One out of six people with HIV (PWH) in the U.S. are incarcerated annually; two-thirds of incarcerated persons meet
criteria for substance use disorder (SUD) and many more in carceral settings are at risk for HIV. Ending the U.S. HIV
epidemic hinges on linking and engaging criminal legal system-involved people with and at risk for HIV, especially those
with SUDs, to optimize ART and PrEP uptake and adherence. Carceral facilities can offer ART and PrEP access, and
increasingly SUD treatment, but in the year following release, nearly 80% of PWH lack viral suppression, and PrEP
coverage is extremely limited. Post-release disruptions in ART stem from multiple causes: health system complexity, SUD
relapse, unstable housing, medical mistrust, and stigma. PrEP outcomes are underexplored, but preliminary data suggest
similar challenges. Because HIV transmission risk is high upon community re-entry, multimodal interventions among
recently incarcerated people with and at risk for HIV are critical to ending the HIV epidemic. The goal of this phased
R61/R33 proposal is to develop a Decentralized, Status neutral, Stakeholder-engaged, post-incarceration intervention
for people with and at risk for HIV with SUD: The DEST2nation model. In addition to peer navigation, we will collaborate
with carceral-focused community-based organizations to address competing priorities, such as unstable housing, lack of
employment in culturally sensitive environments that mitigate stigma. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1 (R61 phase): Pilot
and refine a package of decentralized strategies to address barriers impacting criminal legal system-involved people with
HIV and those at risk. Aim 2: (R33 phase): Test the DEST2nation model (vs. SoC) in a multisite randomized control trial.
Aim 3 (R33): Estimate the cost of implementing and sustaining DEST2nation, and assess its economic value, relative to
SoC, from healthcare sector, state-policymaker, and societal perspectives."
10909820,"In HIV infection, circulating CD4+ T cell counts predict disease progression. Even under long-term suppressive
antiretroviral therapy (ART), up to 25% of virologically suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) fail to restore
CD4+ T cell counts to the levels similar to those in healthy controls, and increased morbidity and mortality have
been demonstrated in these immune non-responders. We were the first group to report that anti-CD4 IgGs
mediate CD4+ T cell death and play a role in poor immune recovery under ART. While the pathogenesis is likely
multifactorial, such as thymic and lymphatic fibrosis, systemic immune activation, and inflammation, our
proposed pathologic anti-CD4 IgG-mediated CD4+ T cell depletion provides a unique mechanism for targeting
CD4+ T cells specifically. In the current study, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms of pathologic anti-
CD4 IgGs and anti-CD4 autoreactive B cells from immune non-responders and identify the therapeutic targets
to prevent anti-CD4 IgG-mediated pathogenesis together with traditional ART to increase immune recovery and
reduce complications, morbidity and mortality in HIV+ Veterans and non-Veterans.
AIM 1. Determine the pathologic activities of anti-CD4 IgGs on CD4+ T cell activation and function and HIV
latency through the CD4 receptor signaling pathway in HIV+ immune non-responders.
AIM 2. Determine the B cell receptor characteristics and gene expression landscape of anti-CD4 autoantibody-
producing B cells from HIV+ immune non-responders.

10909821,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that
affects over 1 million people in the US. T-cell-driven immunopathology is a central feature of MS and other
immune-mediated diseases. As a consequence, the immune regulation of these pathogenic T-cell responses is
an important quest in the approach to autoimmunity. We have had a long-standing interest in the immune basis
of human multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model (EAE). While the pathogenic role of CD4 T-cells is well
established in these diseases, there is growing evidence from us and others for a role of CD8 T-cells in these
diseases. Through studies in MS and EAE, we have demonstrated the critical disease regulatory role of CD8
T-cells in disease. Similar appreciation for the role of these cells in downregulating other autoimmune
diseases has also emerged. We have also shown that the suppressor activity of MS relapse-associated CD8
T-cells can be restored by in vitro pre-treatment with specific cytokines, revealing functional plasticity of
these cells and providing a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. At the same time, it is also
becoming clear that severe autoimmune disease is characterized by increased resistance of
effector/pathogenic CD4 T-cells to immune regulation. Collectively, these studies underscore the
importance of understanding both the biology of CD4 effector T-cell resistance to suppression as well
as the intricacies of CD8 suppression and its modulation. Our proposal addresses this poorly
understood but fundamental feature of the immune regulatory apparatus, in the context of MS. Our
recent studies demonstrate several novel aspects of the CD4-CD8 effector-regulator dynamics and based on
these findings, we hypothesize that CD4 T-cells from MS patients have an intrinsically enhanced tendency to
develop effector resistance to immune suppression in an inflammatory context, while CD8 T-cells from MS
patients have an intrinsically enhanced tendency to develop lower suppressive ability. We also hypothesize
that these phenotypes are plastic and can be modulated by appropriate stimuli. To address these hypotheses,
we will use a two-pronged approach: (1) We will address the biology and modulation of CD4 resistance in MS
to gain direct insights into these processes in the context of autoimmune disease. A part of this aim will also
focus on the novel CD4-intrinsic biology of IL-17 cytokines, as demonstrated in our recent publication; and (2)
We will also address the biology and modulation of CD8 suppression in MS. These studies will provide
important insights into the immune dysregulation that underlies MS pathogenesis, with implications for
treatment approaches in MS and multiple other disease settings."

Liver cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths within the United States, being the fifth and seventh
leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women, respectively. There is a high demand for new and
more effective therapeutics for the treatment of liver cancer, especially for the most common hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), with an improved understanding of vital regulatory factors underlying HCC cell
metabolism essential for tumor progression. Genome-derived noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs)
have been revealed as critical elements to control posttranscriptional gene regulation, and restoration of
liver-enriched, oncolytic miRNAs (e.g., let-7-5p isoforms, miR-122-5p, and miR-148a-3p) lost or
downregulated in HCC cells represents a new therapeutic strategy. However, current miRNA functional and
experimental therapeutic studies are limited to the use of miRNA mimics chemo-engineered in vitro and
comprised of extensive and various types of artificial modifications, which are totally different from natural
miRNA molecules produced in vivo. This is also in sharp contrast to protein research and therapy in which
bioengineered or recombinant protein agents produced and folded in vivo, rather than synthetic
polypeptides or proteins made in vitro, have been used and found enormous success. To overcome this
barrier, the PI has recently developed a novel RNA molecular bioengineering platform technology,
based upon specific hybrid tRNA/pre-miRNA molecules identified in the PI’s lab as carriers, to achieve
high-yield and large-scale, in vivo fermentation production of true biologic or bioengineered RNA
(BioRNA) molecules for basic and translational research. Our following studies have demonstrated that
miRNA (e.g., let-7c-5p) is selectively released from BioRNA “prodrug” in human HCC cells to regulate target
gene expression (LIN28B) and control cellular processes (tumorsphere formation), and
liposome-polyethylenimine (LPP) nanocomplex is superior to in vivo-jetPEI to deliver BioRNA into
orthotopic HCC tissues and inhibit tumor growth in mouse models. Our further efforts have led to the
identification of proper human tRNAs to couple with human hsa-pre-miRNAs as new carriers to offer
humanized BioRNAs to target HCC. In addition, humanized BioRNA/miR-148a-3p is precisely processed
to miR-148a-3p in human HCC cells to modulate specific amino acid and glucose transporter expression
towards the control of aminolyses and glycolysis. Given these exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize
that novel, HCC-targeted, humanized BioRNAs can be bioengineered and used to dissect HCC nutrient
homeostasis and tumor metabolism. To test the hypothesis, we proposed to (i) design, clone, express, and
purify a focused group of novel humanized BioRNAs for the inhibition of HCC cell viability (Aim 1), (ii)
delineate the mechanistic actions of BioRNAs in the control of HCC cell metabolism (Aim 2), and (iii)
establish the effectiveness and safety of candidate BioRNAs in the modulation of HCC tumor metabolism
and progression in vivo (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will offer a set of one-of-a-kind,
biologic, HCC-targeted RNA molecules as research tools, establish new roles for miRNAs in the control of
HCC cell metabolism, and build a solid foundation for the development of new remedies to improve the
treatment of lethal HCC."

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a rapidly growing population with complex service needs estimated to cost $268 billion annually. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for young children with likely ASD yield long-term benefits in terms of child outcomes and reduced costs of ASD to society. As such, policies increasingly emphasize early screening and identification of ASD, placing demand on the early intervention service system to provide care the growing number of young children (under age 3 years) with likelihood of ASD. Latino children in the U.S. are increasingly being diagnosed with ASD at young ages, yet continue to experience disparities in service access and quality relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Recent work has made important progress in developing and testing interventions to promote service use, but not service quality, for Latino families of young children with ASD. A key factor impacting early intervention service quality is caregiver engagement. Caregiver engagement, a multidimensional construct that includes attitudinal (e.g. treatment expectancy) and behavioral (e.g. attendance, in-session engagement) dimensions, is an essential consideration for early intervention services which legally require caregiver involvement (IDEA, 2004) and frequently employ caregiver-mediated interventions which teach caregivers to deliver strategies with their children. While the extent of caregiver engagement is linked to child outcomes, and Latino caregiver engagement disparities have been found in other child service sectors (i.e., mental health), few studies have explored engagement disparities and determinants in early intervention services for ASD. Informed by frameworks of multidimensional engagement (REACH), implementation determinants (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment/EPIS Framework), and health and service disparities (Health Equity Implementation Framework), the present study will seek to: (1) characterize patterns of multidimensional caregiver engagement by ethnicity, acculturation, and socioeconomic status, and (2) identify barriers and facilitators to engagement in ASD early intervention services for Latino families. This SuRE First will build on the PI’s expertise in clinical research, quantitative methods, and student research mentorship, while providing the mentorship and protected time needed to achieve the following career enhancement objectives: (1) refine models for inclusive mentorship, (2) increase research productivity, (3) maximize competitiveness for future grants, and (4) establish the PI as an expert in ASD services and implementation research. This SuRE First award will ensure ample opportunities for active student involvement in research (e.g. observational coding, conducting interviews, mixed methods analysis), while producing pilot data needed to develop future grants (i.e., the development and testing of a multi-level engagement toolkit; future R34/R01) and launch a sustainable research career for the PI."

Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whether taking stimulant medications or not,
experience more sleep problems than their peers. These nighttime sleep problems often lead to daytime
sleepiness, which is likely to exacerbate some of the negative behavior effects commonly associated with ADHD.
Since the most common treatment for pediatric ADHD is psychostimulant medication, methylphenidate (MPH),
there has been a long-standing interest in whether this type of medication results in exacerbated sleep
disturbances and the further development of sleeping disorders later in adulthood. Despite ongoing interest in
the association between stimulant use and sleep in children, there is a lack of evidence regarding the causal
effects of MPH on the sleep functioning of children with ADHD. The goal of the proposed grant is to break down
the complex relationship that early psychostimulant exposure and ADHD can have on sleep neurophysiology
and whether this effect is unique to developmental exposure and persists into adulthood. The first aim of this
grant will study the effects of MPH on sleep architecture and neurophysiological activity (sleep EEG and waking
ERPs) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a well-established and validated model of ADHD, compared
to the inbred Wistar-Kyoto rat control strain. EEG can be used in rodents to provide a translational model of not
only sleep architecture and neuroactivity, but ERPs can be used as a predicting biomarker for neurological
disorders. Study 1A will investigate effects of MPH on sleep patterns and EEG/ERP activity in preadolescent
ADHD rat model of both sexes. Study 1B will determine whether these effects of preadolescent methylphenidate
on sleep patterns and EEG activity will persist into adulthood. The second aim will determine if preadolescent
MPH alters circadian rhythm and light/dark activity throughout the lifespan in ADHD rat models of both sexes.
Study 2A investigates how circadian rhythms and light/dark activity patterns can change across the lifespan in
the SHR compared to the Wistar-Kyoto control strain. This study will also determine whether behavioral
measures common in ADHD (e.g. inattention, hyperactivity, disinhibition) may correlate with sleep quality and
quantity throughout the lifespan. Study 2B will investigate how preadolescent psychostimulant medication in
SHR and control strain rats can alter these circadian rhythm, light/dark activity, and behavioral measures
throughout development and into adulthood."

Medical recordings contain dynamical information that can provide quantitative
pathological fingerprints that prove crucial to correct diagnostic. Brain recordings are
particularly important for cognitive studies, as the state of the brain at a single instant is
not sufficient to determine cognition, which is a highly complex dynamical process.
Consequently, in order to correctly diagnose the severity of cognitive pathologies, it is
important to analyze brain dynamics through their recordings. Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms based on static approaches tend to miss the dynamical spatiotemporal
relations of the recordings, while ML methods based on local equations do not take into
account the long-distance spatiotemporal relations. Here, we propose to use ML methods
based on nonlocal equations and operators that allow us to extract a dynamical fingerprint
of the brain, and use this to develop diagnostic continuous scores (spectra of severity).
The use of nonlocal equations such as integral equations and integro-differential
equations to model the brain has been pioneered decades ago. However, these studies
have never been extended to ML methods, except in our recent preliminary studies. Our
focus, therefore, is to apply such methodologies to model (predict) brain dynamics, and
employ the learned models to extract the model states (self-attention) that characterize
brain cognition. These states will therefore be used to develop diagnostic scores."

 Emergency care of older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is suboptimal
despite greater rates of emergency department (ED) use than for matched controls. Persons with dementia
(PwD) are poorly identified in the ED, are more likely to have an avoidable ED visit, be admitted to the hospital,
struggle in the ED environment, and experience numerous other challenges. Despite calls in the National
Plans to Address Alzheimer's Disease and their updates, limited research has been performed to optimize
the emergency care of PwD.
 To advance the emergency care of PwD first requires delineation of the research gaps related to
identifying PwD receiving emergency care and providing them optimal care, followed by establishing and
testing strategies to resolve the gaps. To effectively and efficiently identify and address these gaps, the goal
of this proposal is to launch the Geriatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network 2.0 - Advancing
Dementia Care (GEAR 2.0 ADC). Specifically, this network would partner and leverage existing ADRD and
emergency care focused networks, foundations, stakeholders, and organizations through a transdisciplinary
team of leading investigators and consultants who have already transformed the emergency care of older
adults and the care of PwD through rigorous NIH-funded research.
 During the first phase of this proposal, a stakeholder engagement approach will be used that has been
previously and successfully implemented by investigators. They will determine research priorities for ED
patients and caregivers using a consensus process in four domains: 1. ED practices 2. ED care transitions 3.
Detection, and 4. Communication and decision making. The GEAR 2.0 - ADC infrastructure and its network
will be established that includes the GEDC, ADRCs, and GEAR 2.0 Cores: 1. Administrative; 2. Research; 3.
Data/Informatics; and 4. Dissemination & Implementation. The second phase of the proposal will solicit, review,
select and fund research that will lead to future full-scale proposals addressing research gaps in emergency
care for PwD and their caregivers identified during the first phase. There will be over $1.1M in pilot study
awards. This proposal will create a platform from which GEAR 2.0 ADC and future investigators will generate
preliminary data for large-scale funding opportunities, including multicenter project proposals. This “priming” of
the research pipeline will promote further transdisciplinary studies and science and lay the groundwork for a
sustainable research network infrastructure to support development of an evidence base to optimize the
emergency care of PwD."

10905169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Skeletal growth occurs during development in cartilage growth plates, bone template regions wherein
chondrocytes actively proliferate, follow a stepwise maturation program, and produce an abundant extracellular
matrix. Their activities are tightly regulated by numerous factors, including the fibroblast growth factor receptor-
3 (FGFR3), whose importance in humans is illustrated by the fact that FGFR3 gain-of-function variants
(FGFR3Ach) cause achondroplasia (ACH), the most frequent form of short stature. The disorder markedly affects
the appendicular skeleton (short limbs), axial skeleton (vertebral stenosis and lordosis) and craniofacial skeleton
(frontal bossing and flat face) and also results in a large spectrum of neurologic issues. Various types of surgical
and pharmacological treatments have been proposed and approved for this condition, but none addresses all
clinical issues, and long-term outcomes are unknown. There is thus an urgent clinical need to develop new, safe
and efficient treatments for ACH. We propose to help address this need by deepening our current understanding
of the pathways acting upstream and downstream of FGFR3 in growth plate chondrocytes (GPCs) and by testing
in preclinical models if targeting newly identified pathways may provide successful treatments. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that the expression of FGFR3 is controlled by several cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) and that
the inactivation of key CREs could safely and effectively lessen the severity of ACH. This hypothesis and our
research strategy rely on a solid scientific premise constituted by published and pilot data. We will create and
analyze CRE reporter transgenic mice to determine to which extent individual CREs reproduce the expression
pattern of Fgfr3. We will also determine which CREs most significantly contribute to Fgfr3 expression in mice by
deleting the most likely ones in the Fgfr3 wild-type and ACH alleles and assessing phenotypic consequences.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that FGFR3Ach perturbs a pathway critical to ensure the high-energy demands of
GPC activities and whose link to FGFR3Ach was uncovered in pilot studies. We will analyze to which extent this
pathway is perturbed and affects GPC activities in ACH. Further, we will use transgenic approaches to test if
normalizing this pathway may safely and effectively lessen ACH features. This project is highly significant and
innovative considering on the one hand the prevalence and severity of ACH and the current lack of fully satisfying
treatments, and considering on the other hand that it will push forward the frontiers of scientific knowledge to
propose novel, potentially life-changing strategies to treat people with ACH, and may also suggest novel
mechanisms and treatments for other chondrodysplasias and still poorly treatable FGFR3-related cancers."

Piezo2 is a non-selective Ca2+-permeable cation channel activated by mechanical force. It is expressed in
peripheral sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and it plays important roles in gentle touch and
injury-induced mechanical pain. Piezos are large proteins, with 38 transmembrane domains and their membrane
footprint is larger than that of any other known ion channels. This suggests that membrane lipids could
significantly impact the behavior of these channels, but exploration of the effects of membrane lipids on Piezo
function is in its early stages. The goal of this proposal is to gain insights into how lipids regulate Piezo channels,
building upon our recent identification of membrane lipids that specifically inhibit Piezo2 activity while not
affecting Piezo1. The proposal is based on our recent finding that the TMEM120A protein robustly inhibits Piezo2,
but not Piezo1 channels. Structural studies of TMEM120A indicate that this protein shows similarity to a lipid
modifying enzyme ELOVL7, with a CoA molecule bound to each monomer. We hypothesized that TMEM120A
inhibits Piezo2 by modifying cellular lipid composition. Our preliminary data show that expressing TMEM120A
increases levels of lipids in the Kennedy pathway of triglyceride synthesis, with the most robust changes in
phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) with saturated acyl chains. Intracellular PA delivery
through the whole cell patch pipette inhibited Piezo2, but not Piezo1 activity. Generating endogenous PA in the
plasma membrane by optogenetic activation of phospholipase D inhibited Piezo2, but not Piezo1 activity.
Intracellular delivery of LPA, as well as incubation with carbacyclic PA (ccPA), a non-metabolizable analogue of
PA and LPA inhibited Piezo2 channels. Our data identify PA and LPA as endogenous inhibitors of Piezo2
channels. In our proposal we aim to identify the molecular determinants of the effects of PA and LPA (Aim1),
investigate their roles in regulation of Piezo2 activity by signaling pathways (Aim 2), and tests in vivo
effectiveness of this lipid regulation on Piezo2 mediated sensory processes (Aim 3).
Overall, we identified novel lipid regulators of Piezo2 channels, that do not affect Piezo1. Our data will provide
important insight into the regulation of Piezo2 by membrane lipids, and the knowledge gained from this study
has the potential to be utilized in the future development of Piezo2 inhibitors for treating various pain
conditions."
10905349,"Each year approximately 3 million United States citizens incur traumatic brain injury (TBI). An
additional 50,000 United States citizens derive permanent vision loss from direct ocular trauma.
Both brain and ocular trauma can involve the optic nerve causing traumatic optic neuropathy
(TON) even in the absence of physical damage, i.e. indirect (ITON). ITON occurs in 2-5% of TBI
civilian patients. Currently there are no effective treatments available for ITON. Secondary axon
degeneration and resulting vision loss occurs 3-6 weeks post-injury in ITON patients. Similarly,
in our mouse model of ITON, there is immediate loss of axons followed by a second wave of
axon degeneration at 14 days post-injury. This gap between initial insult and secondary
degeneration represents a window of therapeutic opportunity. In our model, initiation of
secondary degeneration coincides with an increase in the mitochondrial oxygen free radical,
superoxide and a decrease in the scavenger, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Further,
treatment with vitamin E prevents these changes and promotes RGC axon survival and
preservation of vision. These data support a role for dysfunctional mitochondria in secondary
axon degeneration. In other optic neuropathy models, astrocytes promote RGC axon function
through transfer of healthy mitochondria, while delivery of metabolic resources prolongs axon
survival. Based on these results, we propose that the timing of secondary axon degeneration
after ITON is controlled by astrocyte support of the ratio of normal to dysfunctional mitochondria
in surviving axons. As a corollary to this hypothesis, we also propose that exogenous
mitochondrial transplantation will delay onset of secondary degeneration. We will test this
through the following Specific Aims: 1) Quantify mitochondria dysfunction following ITON; 2)
Quantify resource sharing from astrocytes to surviving RGC axons prior to onset of secondary
neurodegeneration after ITON; 3) Quantify mitochondrial dysfunction immediately prior to and
during ITON-induced secondary neurodegeneration. Upon successful completion of these
studies we will know how mitochondria and mitochondrial quality control processes determine
the timing of onset of secondary neurodegeneration after ITON. This insight will allow us, in
future studies, to test novel therapies that could further slow, prevent, or decrease secondary
neurodegeneration after ITON."

During pregnancy, the uterus gradually transitions from a quiescent state characterized by weak, asynchronous,
regional contractions to an activated state in which contractions increase in force, frequency, and synchrony to
expel the fetus at term. A major driver of this transition is gradual depolarization of the myometrial smooth muscle
cell (MSMC) membrane potential. As the inside of the membrane becomes less negatively charged, the
myometrium becomes more excitable. However, the molecular pathways controlling this transition are unknown,
hampering our ability to develop strategies to regulate uterine contractility to prevent pre- or post-term labor.
Here, we propose to test the central hypothesis that a sodium (Na+) signaling complex formed by the Na+-
activated potassium (K+) channel SLO2.1 and the Na+ leak channel NALCN regulates this transition. This
hypothesis is founded on published and preliminary data we obtained with funding from our previous R01. In
primary human MSMCs isolated at term, we showed that Na+ entry through NALCN activated K+ efflux through
SLO2.1 and hyperpolarized the membrane. Next, we showed that activation of this complex reduced tension in
uterine strips. Finally, we reported that inhibiting this complex induced MSMC depolarization, triggering calcium
(Ca2+) entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and promoting contractility. Together, these data indicate
that the NALCN/SLO2.1 complex is a strong candidate to control the MSMC membrane potential. However,
because we used human tissues, we could not determine the role of this complex in the gradual depolarization
of the MSMC membrane potential over pregnancy. To address this limitation and fully test our hypothesis, our
objective is to define the function and regulation of the NALCN/SLO2.1 complex across pregnancy in mouse
MSMCs. The goals of this project are to: 1) Define NALCN/SLO2.1 complex activity across pregnancy, 2) Assess
the effects of NALCN/SLO2.1 complex activity on intracellular Ca2+ and uterine contractility and 3) Identify
additional members of the NALCN/SLO2.1 complex in MSMCs and determine their effects on functionality of the
complex. In completing these aims, we will define the main regulators of MSMC membrane potential and how
they change as pregnancy progresses. This work will facilitate future efforts aimed at developing therapeutics to
inhibit the NALCN/SLO2.1 complex to promote labor or to activate the complex to promote quiescence and
prevent preterm labor."

The major goal of this training program, which entered its 45th year in September 2019, is to successfully train
young investigators in a career in biomedical research pertaining to lymphocyte biology, ranging from cancer
immunotherapy to neoplastic transformation. This competitive application is especially timely given that results
from Penn-based immunotherapy trials were markedly effective in treating leukemia, a result that contributed to
two FDA-approved drugs. The Penn training program sits at the nexus of the NCI-designated Abramson
Cancer Center and the Institute for Immunology to offer multi-disciplinary training in both basic and
translational research related to cancer immunobiology. Drs. Pear (Program Director) and Beatty (Program Co-
Director) will provide the sustained leadership required for continued development of top-tier cancer
immunobiology training at Penn and have an administrative structure that oversees the needs of the training
program, assisted by an Internal Executive Committee and an External Advisory Board and complemented by
individual research trainee advisory committees. Our training faculty are in multiple departments campus-wide,
including the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia and the Wistar Institute, and have diverse interests that are focused on cancer immunobiology.
Common among our trainers is successful mentoring, independent funding, continued productivity and projects
relevant to cancer immunobiology. Our 2 predoctoral and 8 postdoctoral trainees are competitively selected
and are expected to meet high standards of competence, motivation and perseverance, and have a
commitment to a research career in cancer immunobiology. Recruitment of qualified trainees from diverse
backgrounds is high priority. The training program is anchored in an intensive laboratory experience with a
rigorous mentor. The laboratory experience is complemented by basic lecture courses in immunology and
related disciplines, advanced seminar courses in various aspects of cancer immunobiology, cancer biology and
bioethics, seminars from visiting scientists and Penn faculty, research conferences, workshops and retreats.
Programs developed specifically for our trainees include , a monthly research-in-progress meeting, a tumor
immunobiology journal club, clinical connection experiences, an annual retreat and special symposia, and
training in the responsible conduct of research. Ultimately we will continue to meet our twin goals of supporting
the research and training of young scientists with new or established interests in cancer immunobiology and
providing a rich and rigorous training environment in cancer immunobiology that provides multi-disciplinary
training in cancer biology and immunology."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronically painful condition and a leading cause of disability around the world. OA is
characterized by articular cartilage deterioration and other joint pathologies including meniscus and ligament
damage, synovitis, bone spurs and joint pain. None of the currently approved treatments alter disease
progression by slowing articular cartilage degradation or repairing damage to joint tissues. We identified Phlpp
phosphatases as modifiable targets for cartilage regeneration and joint pain. Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 are
abnormally expressed in human OA cartilage. Phlpp1 knockout (KO) mice are protected from cartilage
degradation and pain-related behaviors (allodynia and reduced mobility) after surgery that destabilizes the
medial meniscus (DMM), but mice where Phlpp1 is conditionally depleted in just aggrecan (Agc)-expressing
cells (Phlpp1 CKOAgc) are only protected from cartilage degradation, not reduced mobility. These results
indicate an intrinsic role for Phlpp1 in chondrocytes, as well as a role for Phlpp1/2 in other tissues or cells
within articulating joints. Of interest, small molecule inhibitors of Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 further slow cartilage
degradation in Phlpp1 CKOAgc mice and increase mobility. Phlpp1/2 inhibitors also stimulate chondrocyte
proliferation and matrix production and prevent neurite outgrowth and expression of sensory neuron genes in
vitro and in vivo. Together these data indicate that Phlpp1/2 activity in multiple cell types/tissues within
articulating joints contributes to OA pathogenesis and that Phlpp2 may contribute to OA phenotypes by
compensating for Phlpp1 deficiency in cartilage and/or by regulating joint innervation and pain-related
behaviors. The overall goals of this project are to define how Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 modulate cartilage quantity
and quality (i.e. stiffness) and how Phlpp1/2 inactivation contributes to injury-induced innervation. The specific
aims are to: 1) Elucidate the roles of Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 in articular chondrocytes following a joint injury, 2)
Determine how Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 affect biomechanical and structural properties of articular cartilage and
other joint tissues after injury and throughout aging, and 3) Define activities of Phlpp1/2 in sensory neurons
and OA-associated pain behaviors. These studies will provide new information about the relationship between
joint damage, joint innervation and pain. Such insights will enable the development of much needed disease-
modifying drugs for osteoarthritis."
10905541,"Each year, approximately 90,000 adolescents and young adults (AYA; National Cancer Institute defined age 15-
39 years at cancer diagnosis) are diagnosed with cancer. Despite increasing recognition that over 10% of AYAs
harbor a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutation in cancer predisposition genes, we know that many
AYA do not get genetic testing, particularly at centers where there is limited access to genetic services. Focused
efforts on the delivery of genetic services in the community setting, where many AYAs receive their care are
needed to improve outcomes in this population. To address this important gap in genetic testing among AYAs
and to address the need for innovative and effective models for delivery of genetic services in community
oncology practices, we propose that an enhanced multimodality eHealth remote genetic services delivery model
could increase uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing among AYA. Our enhanced eHealth delivery
model builds upon related research demonstrating high uptake of web-based pre-test counseling as an
alternative to pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor with no difference in patient reported outcomes (R01
CA190871:Bradbury). Further, we propose to incorporate chatbot technology into our web-based alternative to
address patient-specific questions and to increase engagement and provide service reminders and educational
support throughout the delivery model. The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if our enhanced eHealth and
chatbot enabled delivery model can increase uptake of genetic services and provide non-inferior patient
reported outcomes as compared to the standard model for remote services. We will recruit AYA patients through
the NCORP (National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program). We propose a randomized
study in 396 AYA cancer patients (18-39 YO at enrollment) in community practices to evaluate the efficacy of an
enhanced eHealth and chatbot enabled delivery model as compared to remote genetic counseling and testing
to increase uptake of cancer genetic testing in AYA (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will evaluate the efficacy of the
enhanced eHealth and chatbot enabled delivery model to provide non-inferior short-term and longitudinal
cognitive (e.g. knowledge), affective (e.g. distress), and behavioral outcomes (e.g. cancer screening and
communication to relatives) and costs (Aim 2a), and moderators of these short-term and longitudinal patient
outcomes to understand who benefits more or less from the delivery intervention (Aim 2b). Concurrently, we will
conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)-informed process evaluation to
understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes and facilitators and barriers to future
implementation and sustainability of these delivery models to AYA cancer patients (Aim 3)."
10905602,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Gram-negative oral anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with oral and extraoral diseases due
to its remarkable ability to escape host immunity and spread to extraoral sites, including placenta and colon,
promoting preterm birth and colorectal cancer. How this pathobiont adapts to various metabolically changing
environments enabling its virulence potential is not well understood. To overcome the well-known genetic
intractability of F. nucleatum, we employed multidisciplinary approaches, combining reverse and forward
genetics, advanced electron microscopy, biochemical methods, and rodent models of infection to investigate the
molecular assembly on the cell surface of F. nucleatum, since surface proteins and structures are important in
many cellular processes, including host cell adherence/invasion, motility, and nutrient transport. Subsequently,
we uncovered tubular structures produced by biofilm cells and planktonic cells under stress. Cryo-EM
tomography revealed that these nanostructures are grown out from the outer membrane mainly at the cell pole,
hence named outer membrane tubules or OMTs. Mass spectrometry analysis of isolated OMTs revealed a large
number of proteins predicted to be involved in transport, metabolism, host cell interactions, and stress response,
with many hypothetical outer membrane proteins/lipoproteins. Critically, genetic disruption of OMT-associated
proteins identified two mutants defective in OMT formation, ∆omtA and ∆omtB. Informed by structural studies of
OmtA and OmtB, we propose here to elucidate the mechanism of OmtA-mediated OMT biogenesis, examine
the role of OmtB and its biochemically and genetically linked factors in OMT biogenesis and fusobacterial
metabolism, and examine the role of OMT formation in the pathophysiology of F. nucleatum. The results
generated from this study will not only provide insights into the pathophysiology of this oral pathobiont, as well
as promising targets for therapeutic development, but also advance our knowledge of assembly mechanisms of
membrane-derived appendages in other bacteria."
10905607,"ABSTRACT
Individuals with Substance Use Disorder (SUD) often exhibit increased stochasticity in their choice behavior,
indicating an inability to adopt a consistent internal model and/or an appropriate rate of learning. Tackling
uncertainty related to model adoption requires the brain to estimate the reliability of different internal models
and arbitrate between these models. These processes, however, are not well understood mainly because in
most experimental paradigms only a single type of reward contingency is tested such that either stimuli or actions
predicts reward, not both. Additionally, the rate of learning is affected by other types of uncertainty in the
environment: (1) expected uncertainty due to the probabilistic nature of reward outcomes, and (2) unexpected
uncertainty due to actual changes in the reward environment. Interestingly, subregions of prefrontal cortex (PFC)
are involved in both stimulus- and action-based learning, and in learning under uncertainty. For example, both
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) seem to be similarly engaged in learning under
uncertainty while their activity reflects stimulus and action values, respectively. Although ACC and OFC
subregions of PFC are both involved in adaptive behavior, they may serve different functions. Densely
interconnected with both OFC and ACC, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is also involved in adjusting behavior
when the environment changes. However, it is unclear how BLA and PFC subregions interact to control these
behavioral adjustments. Based on our experimental and computational work in the prior funding period, we
hypothesize that BLA provides information to different subregions of PFC to adjust learning under different forms
of uncertainty. Our central hypothesis is that BLA contributes to the arbitration between internal models
(stimulus vs. action-based) and between different forms of uncertainty (expected vs. unexpected
uncertainty) through its connections to OFC and ACC. Using a combination of computational methods,
pathway-specific chemogenetics, in vivo 1-photon (1P) single-cell calcium imaging, and closed-loop
manipulation, we will test how adopting an appropriate internal model (Aim 1) and adjustments to changes in
the environment (Aim 2) rely on BLA-to-OFC (BLAOFC) vs. BLA-to-ACC (BLAACC) pathways. We further causally
test these circuits by closed-loop control of learning based on both reward-expectation signals in ACC and OFC
at the neuronal ensemble level, which we can decode in real time, and behaviorally using our novel information-

The University of Colorado Anschutz (CU Anschutz) has a strong history of training undergraduate, pre-
and post-doc scientists in the biomedical sciences, and specifically in cancer research. The overarching
goal of the Cancer Research Experience for Undergraduates (CREU) program is to provide a mechanism
through which undergraduate students can explore cancer research as a future career. In this research-
intensive experience, students will spend 10 weeks in a laboratory working with a mentor from the
University of Colorado Cancer Center. Students will choose from 52 qualified mentors with expertise in
basic and clinical/ translational cancer research. CREU is primarily a research-intensive experience,
however students will also attend weekly seminars that explore fundamental questions in cancer biology
and professional development, including career mentoring. In addition, students will select from a variety
of clinical/translational workshops (CTWs) based on their interests. CTW's will typically be ½ day
experiences with faculty and biotechnology companies on the CU Anschutz campus and will be
structured so as to capitalize on unique strengths and cancer training opportunities on our campus in
personalized medicine and bioinformatics, cancer pathobiology and molecular diagnostics, and
experimental therapeutics and biotechnology. A total of 26 students will be selected to participate in
CREU from a pool of national applicants. To assure representation of diverse trainees, we have
established “links” to two minority serving institutions, Chaminade University of Honolulu and the
University of New Mexico. Applicants from these institutions will be given preferential consideration for
participation in CREU, provided they meet our admissions standards. We will also actively recruit under-
represented students at regional and national minority recruitment events. The CREU program is
designed to provide potentially transformative experiences for college students who are interested in
careers in biomedical research, but who have had limited immersive experiences in cancer research.
Our goal is to increase the number of students, particularly from underrepresented minorities, who
choose to pursue cancer research for a career. We will determine how well we meet our goals using
short and long-term evaluation tools."

Chronic lung dysfunction (CLD) is a potentially severe complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT),
particularly prevalent in patients who develop chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) post-BMT. The
development of CLD is associated with a 20%-40% long term survival rate, with the majority of patients
diagnosed with CLD only after they have developed significant (and potentially irreversible) lung pathology.
There is a critical need to identify CLD earlier in its clinical course, at a stage when treatment may prove beneficial
to patients. Parametric response mapping (PRM) is a novel computed tomography (CT) based methodology that
when applied to standard CT scans is capable of identifying and quantifying a variety of lung disease subtypes
in patients. This technology was initially developed at Michigan Medicine over 10 years ago for patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In both single center and multicenter trials, PRM has
demonstrated efficacy for the identification of CLD in adult BMT patients. Our central hypothesis is that PRM can
identify patients with chronic GVHD who are at high risk for the development of CLD. We propose an
observational study to examine PRM in adult and pediatric subjects (≥ 3 years in age) with chronic GVHD post-
BMT. To test our hypothesis, we have established 3 specific aims. In the first two, we will examine PRM values
at two main time points: at the onset of chronic GVHD (Aim 1) and at the onset of CLD (Aim 2), with CLD defined
by standard NIH criteria. In Aim 3, we will develop a machine learning model that will incorporate serologic and
pulmonary function test (PFT) biomarkers with PRM values to develop a composite biomarker strategy. Upon
completion of our current proposal, we will establish PRM as a predictor of CLD in adult BMT patients. In addition,
the PRM, PFT, and serologic data obtained from pediatric BMT patients will provide a data bank for future
research in this population. Historically, the ability to identify CLD in pediatric patients has been PFT-dependent,
with PFTs technically challenging to conduct in young children. The use of PRM as a diagnostic indicator of CLD
in pediatric BMT patients will be a major advance of this proposal. Finally, our proposal takes our PRM
methodology forward in adults, allowing us to study the trajectory of lung disease in adult BMT recipients with
chronic GVHD, and following the onset of CLD."

We propose renewed funding of the Breathing Research and Therapeutics (BREATHE) Training Program at the
University of Florida (UF). This combined predoctoral and postdoctoral training program, which began in 2017,
is focused on the respiratory neuromuscular system, emphasizing discovery of new knowledge and its translation
to severe clinical disorders that compromise breathing capacity, stability and airway defense. In just over 4
years, with a “ramp-up” of 2 years, we established an internationally known training program with a “unique
focus, unlike any other” (quote from anonymous NIH reviewer); we are unaware of any other T32 with a similar
concentration on breathing and airway defense in traumatic, ischemic, infectious or degenerative clinical
disorders, despite their high cumulative prevalence and importance. Nine predoctoral and 7 postdoctoral trainees
have been funded through the BREATHE training program, including those supported by institutional match
funds; all graduates thus far have continued in academic, biomedical or research positions (eg. assistant
professor, clinical research director, K99 awardee, postdoc fellows, grant writer). We successfully recruited
demographically and scientifically diverse trainees (56% women, 31% underrepresented groups, 44% clinically
qualified, 19% engineering backgrounds). In this renewal application, we seek funds to continue building and
refining this unique program, with the goal of training the next generation of scientists devoted to preserving
and restoring breathing and airway defense in clinical disorders that most often end life by respiratory
failure. Our intent is to establish a cohort of respiratory scientists with diverse backgrounds capable of engaging
in basic discovery and/or clinical/translational research, with the necessary background and skills to work
independently and in interdisciplinary teams. BREATHE emphasizes training in respiratory neural and muscle
plasticity, and development of new therapeutic strategies to treat patients with compromised breathing capacity,
stability and/or airway defense. Our objectives are: 1) recruit a diverse cohort of high-quality basic science and
clinical predoctoral (3/year) and postdoctoral (4/year) trainees with an interest in breathing research and
therapeutics, and potential for independent research careers; 2) implement a carefully designed training program
that provides predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with solid foundations in respiratory biology, airway defense
and translational research, and the technical, analytical and professional skills necessary for productive research
careers; and 3) foster an interdisciplinary, collaborative research environment conducive to preparing scientists
for successful careers in interdisciplinary research. The UF environment includes collaborative faculty mentors
with diverse and complementary expertise, state-of-the-art facilities, ongoing translational research partnerships
and a rich menu of career development opportunities. Our renewal application builds on proven elements, with
an emphasis on being responsive to the rapidly changing landscape of respiratory research."

It is clear that the progress of diabetes research during the coming decades will depend heavily upon the ability
to utilize the mouse as an experimental model to investigate both basic and clinically relevant questions in
diabetes research. The strong conservation between the genomes of humans and mice makes the approach of
using genetic alteration mouse technology to create models for human diabetes, endocrine pathologies, and
diabetes complications extremely useful. The Transgenic and Knock-out Mouse Core (TKMC) provides
investigators at UCLA and UCSD with a wide array of genetic manipulations in the mouse including targeted
deletions, insertions, and mutations using CRISPR/Cas9, transgenic genes, homologous recombination in
embryonic stem cells (ES cells), creation of chimeric mice from ES cells, and the most cutting-edge
approaches to performing reverse genetics in the mouse. Transgenic, knock-out, and CRISPR mouse models
are created that utilize the most advanced approaches including conditional Tet-inducible and tamoxifen-
inducible transgenes, tissue-specific and conditional knock-outs using Cre-LoxP and Flp recombinases and
recombination–mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), BAC transgenics, BAC-Trap, RiboTag, and other
specialized technologies. This long-standing Core is an outstanding example of how extraordinarily specialized
techniques, highly trained dedicated personnel, specially constructed facilities, and expensive equipment can
be accessed by researchers who could not reasonably expect to develop them on an individual basis.

Abstract
Survivors of childhood cancer in their thirties have exercise intolerance that mirrors values found among older
adults in the general population. Exercise intolerance among survivors substantially increases their risk for early
mortality, reduced cognitive function, poor quality of life, emotional distress, and sub-optimal participation in
social roles. Fortunately, exercise intolerance is modifiable, even among individuals with impaired cardiac,
pulmonary, and neuromuscular health. Nevertheless, survivors do not, on average, engage in exercise. Our
hypothesis is that regular exercise may be difficult and/or uncomfortable for childhood cancer survivors because
of underlying organ system impairments (specific impairment prevalence ranges from 15.5-37.7% in our eligible
population). The premise of this proposal is that tailored interventions, designed, and supervised by a
professional with appropriate expertise are necessary to help survivors with significant impairment feel
comfortable and gain confidence with exercise and physical activity. These interventions need to be delivered in
a way that both incorporates the initial supervision and advice that these survivors need, while minimizing
disruption in their daily lives. This proposal tests the efficacy of an individually prescribed exercise intervention
on exercise tolerance, with initial instruction provided at one clinical visit, and subsequent supervision and
exercise progression provided remotely. This study, using an experienced multidisciplinary team (exercise
physiology, psychology, cardiology, internal medicine, oncology, survivorship, implementation science experts),
if effective, will move standard of care (encouraging physical activity) for exercise intolerance from its’ current
state, where it is ineffective for many survivors, to a clinically actionable, practical, sustainable, relatively low
cost, and generalizable intervention."

including autologous and allogeneic transplants using cells from matched and mismatched related and unrelated
donors, cord blood units, ex vivo manipulated cell products and genetically modified cells, as well as novel
chimeric antigen receptor T cell products. Stanford’s BMT-CT Program participates in basic and clinical research
as a single institution, and within regional, national and international consortia. The Division is supported by a
NIH Program Project Grant with over 32 years of funding of basic scientific research and clinical translational
trials that advance the field. The Program is strengthened by highly experienced biostatics and data management
groups, and a cGMP-compliant, FACT and CLIA certified Cellular Therapy Facility for routine cell processing
and the development of investigational cellular therapies. The Program is a high accrual BMT CTN center and
has enrolled 579 patients to 25 CTN studies. In the past granting period, Stanford investigators served in
leadership roles of both committees and clinical trial protocols. Additionally, Stanford faculty participated on
several protocol development committees and on other steering committees and task forces. Stanford will
continue to leverage the capabilities of its Program to support the research goals of the CTN. It is our collective
mission to advance the field of BMT-CT for patients with rare and difficult to treat blood diseases through high
quality multi-center clinical trials. The goal of the proposed protocol in the current application is to determine
whether a novel strategy can prevent and reduce the risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
patients lacking HLA matched donors, and thereby improve upon traditional allogeneic BMT. We propose a
phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Orca-T, an engineered donor graft in which a highly
purified Treg product is administered the same day as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells followed 2 days
later by conventional CD3+ T cells. The target population is patients with ALL, MDS, or AML receiving
myeloablative conditioning followed by HCT using HLA mismatched unrelated donors (MMURDs). This
investigator-initiated study builds upon our prior preclinical and clinical work with the Orca-T graft engineering
platform in the HLA matched donor setting. The primary outcome of the Phase 2 portion is efficacy, as defined
by GVHD-relapse-free survival (GRFS) at one year following HCT. Based on aggregated data, we hypothesize
that the Orca-T allograft in combination with dual-agent GVHD prophylaxis (tacrolimus plus ruxolitinib) will
synergistically and significantly reduce rates of GVHD in adults undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT with
MMURDs. The Stanford BMT-CT program is committed to continued participation in BMT CTN trials, contributing

More than 250,000 children survive pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization each year in the United
States, yet we have an incomplete understanding of recovery trajectory and modifiable factors to optimize
survivorship. PICU survivors have multisystem diseases and suffer multisystem morbidities many years after
hospital discharge in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health domains. Our preliminary data indicate
presence of clinically significant pain among 1 in 3 children and sleep disturbances in over 50% of children
months to years after PICU hospitalization, placing them at risk for poorer long-term health outcomes.
However, key knowledge gaps remain in understanding risk factors and mechanisms for persistent pain and
sleep disturbances in PICU survivors, limiting potential interventions that could have broad implications for
long-term recovery. For example, PICU survivors are known to suffer substantial cognitive impairments,
particularly within the executive function construct, crucial to long-term academic achievement, quality of life,
and psychosocial well-being. Chronic pain and sleep disturbances are potentially modifiable, and linked to
worse executive function in other pediatric populations. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the
impact of pain and sleep on executive function outcomes in PICU survivors. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that pain and sleep disturbances are important post-PICU morbidities that are key mediators
between acute illness factors, psychosocial vulnerabilities and executive function outcomes in children after
critical illness.
We will conduct a longitudinal outcomes study of PICU survivors aged 8-18 years with the following objectives:
1) Identify pain trajectories and biopsychosocial risk factors for chronic pain in PICU survivors; 2) Elucidate
longitudinal sleep disturbances in PICU survivors and sleep-pain associations over 12 months; 3) Test the
impact of sleep and pain on EF outcomes in PICU survivors over 12-months. The study will utilize objective
measures of acute illness severity, novel metrics of psychosocial vulnerabilities, and a mix of objective
assessment and subjective report of pain, sleep, and executive function outcomes to comprehensively
evaluate temporal and mediating relationships 3, 6, and 12-months after PICU hospitalization. This proposal is
significant because it addresses the common and debilitating morbidities of chronic pain and sleep
disturbances that affect thousands of PICU survivors annually. Our data will identify risk factors across a
biopsychosocial framework to improve identification and treatment of pain and sleep disturbances, and aligns
with the National Institutes of Health Sleep Disorders Research Plan and Federal Pain Research Strategy. This
research will provide a greater understanding of sleep, pain, and executive function in PICU survivors key for
designing and implementing interventions aimed at optimizing recovery."
10939926,"Project Summary / Abstract
The long-term goal of my lab is to better understand cellular mechanisms that regulate secretory granule
maturation, efficient packaging of hormone, and secretion. In doing so, we will identify drug targets that improve
secretory efficiency during disease. Defects in storage, maturation, or secretion of peptide hormones can lead
to several mental and metabolic disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, and diabetes. Despite the
importance of this widespread secretion mechanism, the cellular signals that regulate secretory granule
maturation remain unclear. Dense core secretory granules (DCSG) are organelles for the intracellular storage
and stimulus-dependent exocytosis in regulated secretory cells. The hallmarks of granule maturation include:
losing the clathrin coat, acidifying lumen, processing of hormone peptide, and formation of a dense core. This is
consistent for many peptide processing cells. In this proposal, we will focus proinsulin processing in β cells and
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) processing in neurons. In both cell types, distinct subpopulations of DCSG exist.
These subpopulations have different protein and lipid content which affects their secretory capacity. For example,
specific signals lead to preferential secretion of subsets of DCSG granules. We have a limited understanding of
how many subpopulations exist and even less is understood regarding their spatial localization.
A key gap in knowledge is understanding how different signaling networks affect maturation and the formation
of distinct DCSG subpopulations. Additionally, DCSG maturation and the locations it occurs within the cell are
still considered a black box. Thus, use of single-cell unbiased imaging approaches, or those with no requirement
for stains or probes, are ideal for capturing DCSG maturation in the context of the entire cell. Over the next 5
years, we will establish a high-throughput, and generalizable quantitative structural cell biology platform. To do
this, we will leverage soft X-ray tomography (SXT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). SXT
will be used to map cell organization and quantify the molecular packing of secretory granules (or maturation),
which has not been possible with other approaches. We will complement these studies with functional live-cell
imaging, using a FLIM-based pH probe developed in my lab to monitor granule pH (maturation). We will explore
how different signaling pathways influence DCSG maturation and the spatial localization of specific DCSG
subpopulations. For a holistic understanding of how the rest of the cell contributes to maturation, we will quantify
cellular reorganization by analyzing organelle volumes and inter-organelle contacts. We hypothesize that cAMP
signaling and DCSG interactions with the mitochondria enhance secretory efficiency. The proposed work will
validate our pipeline as a generalizable approach for studying DCSG maturation and uncover new mechanistic
insights into how the cell regulates maturation. This will provide the basis for future development of more effective
therapeutics that enhance secretory efficiency during disease."
10940315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of premature birth and increases the risk
of mortality, long-term medical needs, and neuro-developmental impairments. Exposure of preterm lung to
supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) increases the risk of BPD, due to arrest of alveolar and vascular growth.
Impaired angiogenesis is a key component of this growth arrest in the lung. Lung endothelial cells (LEC) initiate
angiogenesis to establish vascular networks; the mechanisms of decreased angiogenesis in hyperoxia remain
unknown. Our recent studies in a neonatal mouse model of oxygen induced BPD identified decreased expression
of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in the lungs. LKB1 regulates the function of 5'AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a
key metabolic regulator, and the expression of sucrose non fermenter related kinase (SNRK), a novel AMPK
related kinase; both were decreased in hyperoxia exposed lungs. Levels of PGC-1α, an AMPK target required
for mitochondrial biogenesis, were also decreased in hyperoxia exposed lungs. Treatment of mouse pups with
the AMPK activator, metformin, restored mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis in the lung. The mechanistic
link between mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis remains unclear. Endothelial cells (EC)
initiate angiogenesis through commitment to either a migratory, tip cell phenotype which initiates the sprout or a
proliferative stalk cell phenotype that elongates the vascular sprout. Notch ligands determine the EC phenotype
with the tip cells expressing delta like 4 (Dll4) and stalk cells, Jagged1. Our preliminary data show that hyperoxia
increases Dll4 and decreases Jag1 levels in LEC. Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that the exposure
of preterm lungs to hyperoxia decreases LKB1-AMPK signaling, which leads to decreased mitochondrial
biogenesis and sustained alterations in Notch signaling to impair angiogenesis. We propose two specific aims
to investigate our hypothesis: (1) Determine the mechanism by which hyperoxia decreases LKB1-dependent
signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis. Experiments under this aim will investigate the role of LKB1
downregulation in decreased mitochondrial number and function in hyperoxia, using genetic gain and loss of
function studies in LEC and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and genetically altered mice. (2)
Investigate the role of decreased LKB1-dependent signaling in the impaired angiogenesis in lung during
hyperoxia. Experiments under this aim will investigate the role of LKB1-AMPK downregulation in the decreased
Jag1/increased Dll4 expression and the role of this altered phenotype of EC in decreased angiogenesis in the
lung in hyperoxia. Aim 2 studies will use mice with endothelial specific loss or gain of LKB1, PGC-1α, and Jag1.
Delineation of the mechanisms of decreased angiogenesis in BPD can identify novel therapeutic targets to
restore lung growth in BPD. Since the AMPK activator, metformin is approved for clinical use, our studies are
highly translatable to the prevention of BPD."

 This research aims to develop and test a wearable, always-on stethoscope to provide a solution to the
unmet need for the quantification of respiratory symptoms. Such a device is necessary for the accurate diagnosis
of asthma and assessment of asthma control in 6.8 million infants, young children and other populations with
intellectual disability who are unable to report their respiratory symptoms or perform lung function testing in the
United States. With accurate diagnosis and assessment of control, appropriate asthma therapy can be initiated
without delays to minimize adverse asthma outcomes. The key elements needed in the proposed wearable
stethoscope (i.e., a wireless stethoscope without a bulky acoustic coupler) are (1) resonant microphone array
with unprecedented sound detectability over 100 – 800 Hz and (2) ultra-low power signal processing. We propose
to develop a bank of acoustically-filtering microphones that are based on a high Q (quality factor) resonance of
a microphone diaphragm, for accurate detection of abnormal lung sounds. A bank of Q-filtered and Q-enhanced
microphones is proposed so that (1) feature-extracting filters may be avoided and (2) extremely small lung
sounds can be detected from the chest without an acoustic coupler.
 Lung sounds are very difficult to detect from the chest without a bulky acoustic coupler, as the sound
pressure level (SPL) is only 22 – 30 dB SPL, in free space, over a frequency range of 100 – 800 Hz. This kind
of SPL cannot be accurately detected by a commercial miniature microphone. Thus, we will develop and use an
array of 8 resonant microphones with Q of 40 – 60 (fabricated with a microfabrication process) to detect lung
sounds down to 22 dB SPL, 4 dB lower than the lowest sound a human ear can detect, and to automatically
segment the sound’s frequency components into 8 different narrowly-band-passed frequency regions over 100
– 800 Hz.
 We hypothesize that continuous ambulatory monitoring of lung sounds for acoustic characteristics of
asthma will improve the diagnostic accuracy and treatment in pediatric asthma patients. Currently, asthma is
diagnosed in small children primarily through caregiver history and brief in-office exam as direct patient history
and respiratory function testing are not available for these young patients. The proposed device is entirely novel
as currently there is no device capable of providing round-the-clock monitoring for signs of asthma. While
conventional microphones can detect cough and overt wheezing, their utility is limited by insufficient sensitivity,
and are not amenable for continuous, ambulatory monitoring.
 The proposed resonant microphone array will be integrated with ultralow power electronics for a wearable
stethoscope that continuously tracks lung sounds for the detection of asthma signs and symptoms such as cough
and wheeze which may occur during exercise or sleep (when caregivers are not present) and may be
misreported or ignored by young children. Wirelessly transmitted abnormal lung sounds will be accessed through
the internet. The proposed stethoscope will provide an unprecedented means for those incapable of providing
an accurate history or difficulty with self-management, such as pre-verbal children and individuals with
intellectual disability, to avoid serious asthma morbidity. The device detects signs of uncontrolled asthma and
notifies the parent, caregiver and medical professionals through the internet. In doing so, we may improve the
management of asthma patients through more accurate tracking of environmental and behavioral triggers which
can be used to improve management.
 To test the potential clinical utility of the wearable stethoscope, we will first record lung sounds with
conventional electronic stethoscopes from pediatric patients, and annotate them as “normal,” “wheeze,” “cough,”
etc. by a panel of expert reviewers. The annotated sounds will be subjected to spectral filtering chosen to parallel
the frequency response of the proposed resonant microphone array. A pattern recognition algorithm will be
applied to these sound files and be used to determine the recognition accuracy of the wearable stethoscopes.
Four sets of the wearable stethoscopes will be delivered at the 18th, 30th, 42nd and 54th month of the research
period, and will be used to record lung sounds and test automatic classification accuracy, which will be compared
to patients diagnosed with well- or poorly-controlled asthma as determined by consensus diagnostic criteria.
Finally, the wearable stethoscopes will be tested in ambulatory asthmatic pediatric patients continuously over a
30 day period, for the predictive ability of the wearable stethoscope in detecting asthma attacks."
10912456,"Cilia (also known as flagella) are hair-like organelles protrude from the surface of most eukaryotic cells and are
responsible for cellular motility, fluid flow and sensory perception. A large group of human diseases, known as
ciliopathies, are caused by cilia dysfunction. The elongated shape of the cilium is supported by a highly
conserved structure called the axoneme. In most motile cilia, the axoneme has a 9+2 architecture in which
nine doublet microtubules (DMTs) surround a central pair of singlet microtubules (MTs). Bound periodically
along the length of each DMT are a variety of MT-associated proteins and complexes that decorate the
external and luminal surfaces with different periodicities (8,16, 24, 48 and 96-nm). These protein complexes
are found in coherent register along the entire length of the DMT, and loss of the coherence causes impaired
motility. How periodicity is established, maintained, and synchronized, especially over a long distance, has
been a long-standing question in the field. Each DMT has a distinctive structure with one complete ring of A-
tubule and one incomplete ring of B-tubule. How the unique architecture of the DMT is formed in vivo is still
unclear. Furthermore, many axonemal components are asymmetrically distributed in both the longitudinal
direction and the radial direction among the 9 DMTs. For example, 3 of the 9 DMTs contain a unique “beak”
structure in the proximal B-tubule lumens. To date, the molecular components and biological functions of the
beak are unknown. In this proposal, based on the identification of 33 microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) in our
recent work using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we propose to elucidate the functions of
individual MIPs during ciliogenesis using Chlamydomonas mutants. The objective of this application is to use a
combination of genetic and structural approaches to investigate the architectural principles governing the
assembly of DMTs and axonemes. We will focus on three key aspects of the architectural principles with the
following specific aims: (1) We will identify the key proteins responsible for maintaining coherent registry
between different periodicities, and investigate their mutual dependence, using Chlamydomonas mutants
lacking filamentous MIPs, external coiled-coil proteins, and proteins located at interfaces between different
repeat regions. (2) We will investigate the molecular mechanism governing B-tubule formation, and test two
hypotheses: (i) proteins located at the MT seam, the unique site within the A-tubule, are essential for B-tubule
formation; (ii) MIPs located at the outer junction (OJ) function to promote the B-tubule formation by shielding
the inhibitory effects of tubulin C-terminal tails at the OJ. (3): We will identify protein components of the beak
using high-resolution cryo-EM. Our preliminary data suggest that two main components are tektin filaments
and SAXO proteins. We will investigate their cellular functions and relevance to human diseases using
Chlamydomonas mutants and in vitro assays. Most of the proteins studied here have orthologs in human cilia;
therefore, our work will provide a molecular basis for understanding the etiology of many human ciliopathies."

 It has been estimated that over 1.4 million people in the United States suffer from Lewy body
dementia (LBD), including both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease with dementia
(PDD). Patients with LBD suffer from cognitive decline, sometimes linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD),
and the motor and behavioral changes seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, the diagnosis
of LBD can be difficult, particularly in those DLB patients that present with cognitive impairment prior to
motor or marked behavioral changes. While diagnostic biomarkers for LBD have been limited, recent
developments have suggested that determining Lewy body pathology (LBP) and AD pathology change
may be possible with biofluid biomarkers.
 Until recently, impediments to biomarker development in LBD have included small subject numbers, a
lack of systematic patient characterization and a failure to perform longitudinal follow up with autopsy.
Both AD and PD have benefited from a number of large “consortiums” that have advanced research by
leveraging the strengths of several groups of research centers to combine efforts with standardized
approaches to the study of the disease. One good example is the Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC)
program, funded by the National Institute on Aging, where over 30 research centers across the United
States have agreed to a standardized approach to the diagnosis and characterization of patients with
AD. Other similar programs include the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
(NINDS) Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), and the Parkinson's Progression Marker
Initiative (PPMI). Fortunately, the latter two PD programs have included more systematic clinical
assessments and collection of biofluids and imaging data relevant to cognition in PD. Until funding of
the Dementia with Lewy Body Consortium (DLBC), no similar US-based program had existed.
 The objective of this DLBC renewal proposal is to utilize and expand the DLBC cohort with additional
subjects enrolled, continued longitudinal systematic assessments, collection of biofluids and imaging
data, and ultimately autopsy. As a more hypothesis-driven renewal proposal, the DLBC will utilize the
longitudinal data, imaging and biofluid collection from DLBC participants to focus on diagnosis,
progression and clinical variability. Two new Co-Principal Investigators and a number of new co-
investigators and collaborators will join the DLBC to enhance the additional focus on the new
hypothesis-driven aims."

Sustained attention, the ability to focus on an activity or stimulus over time, is impaired in many brain disorders.
Targeting attentional deficits for treatment is critical because these symptoms are negatively correlated with
functional outcome and quality of life. Continuous performance tests (CPTs) have been designed to measure
sustained attention in multiple species. Similar neural circuits are engaged in both humans and model organisms
during CPT performance, supporting their use in translational studies that screen for novel therapeutics. The
prelimbic cortex (PrL), is involved in both conflict detection and allocation of attention to cues before orientation,
important components in go/no-go tasks like CPTs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies in humans show that
neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which shows functional and anatomical analogy to
the rodent PrL, is correlated with task engagement and performance in the CPT. In this application, we optimize
the rCPT to determine the effect of target percentage on the time-on-task vigilance decrement. We then evaluate
the optimized CPT paradigm by assessing the impact of amphetamine, a known enhancer of performance, on
the electrophysiological correlates of behavior. Finally, we mechanistically test the role of neural activity in the
PrL-LC circuit in controlling behavioral performance and electrophysiological correlates in the optimized rCPT."
10936854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus identified at the end of
2019, has led to the current global pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus of
the genus betacoronavirus, the genus from which two SARS-CoV-2 closely related viruses (SARS-CoV-1 and
MERS-CoV) have crossed the species barrier to humans in the past 17 years. These coronaviruses have
crossed into humans through zoonotic transmissions from animal reservoirs highlighting a potential threat for
future spillovers. Therefore, development of intervention strategies that can mitigate outbreaks of future
coronaviruses is critical. To prepare for future coronavirus (CoV) pandemics, it is desirable to generate vaccines
capable of eliciting neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against diverse CoVs. Currently there are two major
challenges to develop prophylactic vaccine-based strategies against coronaviruses; 1) identification of CoV spike
broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites for vaccine targeting; and 2) the development of vaccine strategies
that can reproducibly induce durable and protective bnAb responses against a broad range of coronaviruses. In
this R01 grant application, we will squarely address these knowledge gaps by employing a bnAb epitope based
rational vaccine design approach to develop immunogens and immunization strategies that can induce
coronavirus protective bnAb responses by vaccination. The project consists of 3 aims: Aim #1 will design novel
spike S2 stem bnAb site targeting vaccine immunogens using a rational reverse vaccine engineering approach.
Using CoV spike S2 stem helix bnAbs and their UCAs we will design, CoV S2 stem peptide-based nanoparticles,
rationally engineered S2 bnAb germline-targeting S-protein trimer immunogens and their multimerized
nanoparticle versions that can efficiently in vivo activate B cell precursors targeting the S2 stem region conserved
across β-CoV spikes. Aim #2 will iteratively evaluate and optimize prime boost immunization strategies in
appropriate pre-clinical animal models to develop vaccine protocols that can reproducibly induce durable and
protective bnAb responses against diverse β-CoVs. We will assess the in vivo protective efficacy of the vaccine-
induced bnAb responses in appropriate virus challenge models. Aim #3 will generate spike S2 stem helix bnAb
based “super antibodies” against β-coronaviruses by utilizing rational antibody engineering approaches. The
overall goal of this R01 grant proposal is to rationally design novel vaccine immunogen candidates, develop
robust vaccination strategies that can induce durable protective bnAb responses against a broad range of β-
coronaviruses and develop “super antibody” molecules promising for broad coronaviruses intervention strategies
to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and emerging coronaviruses as part of pandemic preparedness."
10936855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
By 2050, over 75% of cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are expected to occur in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as India, which is world’s most populous country with a population
of >1.4 billion. Education is the strongest known modifiable protective factor for ADRD, yet ~50% of adults aged
≥45 in India have no formal education and will carry a heavy share of the future global dementia burden.
Education is thought to protect against ADRD by promoting cognitive reserve, a theoretical construct
representing between-person differences in the susceptibility of cognitive function to brain pathology. The
determinants of cognitive reserve in older adults who lack formal education are unknown. There is a critical need
to identify modifiable factors that promote later-life cognitive reserve in older adults across a range of educational
backgrounds. Our overarching goal is to empirically characterize cognitive reserve in a diverse population that
largely lacks formal education and identify the roles of life course employment, social relationships, and social
engagement as modifiable factors that may promote cognitive reserve, slow cognitive decline, and reduce ADRD
risk, among older adults with and without formal education. To achieve our goal, we will use data on general and
domain-specific cognitive function from the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP), MRI and blood-
based AD biomarker measures of brain pathology, and in-person interviews in the NIA-funded, nationally
representative “Longitudinal Study of Aging in India: Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia” (LASI-DAD) Waves 1
and 2 (2017-20 to 2022-24). We will operationalize cognitive reserve as the variance in general and domain-
specific cognitive function that is not explained by MRI and blood-based AD biomarker measures of brain
pathology. Indeed, our preliminary data show a robust operationalization of this approach that is consistent with
results from high-income, Western older populations, using data from an MRI pilot study at LASI-DAD Wave 1.
We aim to 1) compare the contributions of comprehensive brain pathology measures to general and domain-
specific cognition between older adults with and without formal education; 2) evaluate the roles of employment,
social relationships, and social engagement in promoting cognitive reserve among older adults with and without
formal education; and, 3) compare the associations of employment, social relationships, and social engagement
with cognitive change and ADRD incidence among older adults with and without formal education. This proposal
is a major innovation in ADRD research, as it will challenge the conventional use of formal education as the
predominant contributor to cognitive reserve. It will identify modifiable non-educational pathways to later-life
cognitive reserve. This proposal is significant because it represents a large share of the global population that
has no formal education due to a lack of opportunity and has high ADRD risk. Our results will advance scientific
theory on resilience to aging-related brain pathology in the absence of formal education and support the
identification of intervention targets to reduce the global ADRD burden for diverse older populations."

The real-world clinical bulk sequencing samples contain mosaics of various cell types. The recent success of
signal deconvolution methods demonstrated that properly accounting for cell type mixture proportions leads to
improvement in biomarker discovery and better interpretations at cell-type resolution. The current statistical
methods, however, are all based on a very strong assumption that a common reference panel is shared across
the whole population. This deviates from the biological fact that person-to-person heterogeneity exists, even at
cell-type level. To address these issues, I propose to develop a series of novel statistical methods to conduct
deconvolution at the `personalized + cell-type' level. I will properly model the admixture data, retrieve individual-
specific and cell-type-specific reference panels, use them to improve cell type proportion deconvolution, and
conduct statistical rigorous test to identify cell-type-specific differentially-expression genes. First, leveraging on
temporal or repeatedly measured data, we will develop a mixed-effect model based iterative algorithm, to extend
the current cell type mixture modeling by allowing for personal-level reference panels. We will obtain individual-
specific and cell-type-specific reference estimation, to retrieve more accurate, personalized gene expression
profiles. Next, we will develop a statistical framework to deconvolute samples with repeated measures, to im-
prove the cell type proportion estimation. We will also conduct wet-lab experiments to validate our statistical
methods. Third, we will develop methods to test for cell-type-specific differentially expressed genes, by incorpo-
rating individual-specific reference panels. We will also compile existing tools that can conduct cell-type-level
differential expression gene analysis in the bulk data, benchmark them, and develop methods to evaluate the
statistical power. Finally, we will apply the proposed methods to analyze the bulk transcriptome data from The
Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) for type 1 diabetes research, from Parkinson's
Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP), and other large consortia with longitudinal bulk samples. Our methods
and software packages will provide important resources that enable new biomedical genomics studies, such as
biomarker discovery of individual cell-type transcriptomics/epigenetics biomarkers associated with environmen-
tal factors, or disease risk prediction using cell type related profiles and proportions. Our proposed work will
significantly enhance our abilities to re-analyze and re-use bulk sequencing data, enhance the utility of decon-
volution to a `personalized + cell-type' level, and have major impact on the cell-type-specific data mining and
inference in clinical settings."

More robust and accurate health knowledge is a cornerstone of better health policy and action. There are
tough questions in HIV that can be addressed better with new quantitative tools. Results from experimental
and observational HIV studies can be made better and more policy-relevant through development and use of
new methods at the interface of statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, and artificial intelligence. An
innovative combination of semiparametric statistical theory, causal models, and ensemble machine learning
provides a unique opportunity for better results from HIV studies. In this work, we propose new estimators of
the risk (or survival) function. These new estimators improve accuracy, accommodate competing events, allow
effects to be generalized to specific populations of interest, incorporate machine learning of nuisance functions
to relax assumptions about model form, and allow sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of uncontrolled
biases. The specific aims are vehicles to develop, test, and disseminate these new estimators. These aims are
to 1) estimate the long-term treated history of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in this large US cohort
of women with HIV; 2) estimate the observational analog of the per-protocol parameter using a treatment
decision design to compare composite endpoints under an integrase-inhibitor-based treatment compared
to an efavirenz-based treatment in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design;
3) estimate the per-protocol parameter for TDF-FTC versus ABC-3TC arms; and 4) estimate the per-
protocol parameter for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus masked placebo on risk of preterm
birth in Zambian HIV+ pregnant women. The assembled team features field-leading expertise in
epidemiology, statistics, and HIV medicine. Scientific products will include publications and workshop
presentations describing new methodological approaches and new substantive findings that emerge after
applying the proposed methods to each of the problems identified in the specific aims. We will also produce
publicly available R packages and SAS macros to implement the proposed estimators."

Two out of every three adults has overweight or obesity, which is associated with significant medical and
psychological consequences. To date, the most successful weight loss treatment is behavioral weight loss
(BWL), which includes nutrition and physical activity education, as well as behavior therapy techniques.
Although some adults lose weight in these programs, one third to one half do not respond with even bleaker
rates of weight loss maintenance over time. These low success rates suggest that there are underlying
mechanisms, such as appetitive traits, that may interfere with response to BWL and underscore the critical
need to develop targeted models for the treatment of obesity. Our data suggest that high food responsiveness
(FR) is a risk factor for failure in BWL. We have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity based on
the Behavioral Susceptibility Theory, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), that focuses on decreasing FR and
improving satiety responsiveness (SR). In this study, we propose to recruit adults with overweight and obesity
who also exhibit high levels of FR to test the efficacy of an enhanced ROC treatment program (ROC+) for this
specific behavioral phenotype. We propose a 3 arm randomized controlled trial that will compare ROC+, BWL
and an active comparator (AC). We will recruit and randomize 300 adults with overweight and obesity and will
assess them at baseline, during treatment, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Primary and
secondary aims are as follows. Primary Aim 1: Compare ROC+ to AC on body mass index (BMI) over the
course of treatment and follow-up. Primary Aim 2: Compare ROC+ to BWL on body mass index (BMI) over the
course of treatment and follow-up. Secondary Aim 1: Compare BWL to AC on body mass index (BMI) over the
course of treatment and follow-up. Secondary Aim 2: Compare ROC+, BWL and AC on sensitivity to satiety,
sensitivity to food cues, inhibition, restriction, caloric intake, and overeating over the course of the treatment
and follow-up. Exploratory aim 1: Evaluate effects of mediators (FR, SR, restriction, overeating) and
moderators (demographics, baseline BMI) of treatment effects on weight loss over time. This program of
research is an important next step in the development of treatments for specific phenotypes of adults with
overweight/obesity, and could change the paradigm of obesity treatment for these individuals. This study will
contribute to the study of appetitive phenotypes of obesity, will provide a targeted treatment for individuals with
high FR, and could inform clinical decision making for adults with obesity."
10909987,"A major recent advancement for the field of pain research is the recognition of immune system
dysregulation as a contributor to the most serious adverse outcomes from injury. Both autoinflammation
involving mediators of inflammation and autoimmunity involving autoantibodies have been identified in
patients with chronic pain and disability after limb trauma. Taking advantage of these advancements, the
overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify novel approaches to controlling immune system
activation after limb injury thereby increasing the rate and improving the quality of recovery while reducing
chronic pain, functional loss and neuropsychiatric consequences such as anxiety and cognitive decline.
Building on evidence from the fields of immunology, pain and rehabilitation, this project will focus on the
autonomic regulation of the immune system after injury. The proposed experiments involve a well-validated
rodent tibial fracture model of limb injury as well as samples obtained from patients with chronic limb pain
after traumatic events. Our central hypothesis is that interruption of a sympathetically-initiated
immunological cascade will greatly enhance the rate and quality of recovery by reducing IL-6 production,
autoantibody formation and activation of the complement cascade.
 The project is divided into three aims. In the first aim we will determine whether modulation of autonomic
outflow after tibial fracture reduces immune activation and improves key dimensions of recovery. We
hypothesize that post-traumatic activation of the sympathetic nervous system sets an immunological
pathway in motion including IL-6 expression, IgM autoantibody production and complement activation
ultimately leading to chronic pain, functional decline, anxiety and cognitive decline. Activation of the
parasympathetic nervous system may have opposite effects. Using neuroablative and pharmacological
approaches, we will test this hypothesis using a panel of outcome measures designed to address multiple
dimensions of recovery.
 In the project’s second aim we focus strongly on the roles of IL-6 signaling after limb injury as a mediator
supporting IgM autoantibody production. We hypothesize that blocking the sympathetically-enhanced
production of IL-6 after limb injury will reduce autoantigen expression in the injured limbs, regional lymph
node hypertrophy, B-cell differentiation and IgM autoantibody production. We will use genetic tools as well
as clinically available biologic and small molecule anti-IL-6 agents to define the role of this cytokine in
supporting the long-term adverse outcomes of limb injury.
 Finally, the project’s third aim is to determine whether injury-related autoantibodies support adverse
outcomes via peripheral and central complement system activation. We hypothesize that IgM
autoantibodies produced by limb injured mice and, translationally, limb injured patients support complement
cascade activation leading to the generation of pain-promoting C5a and neuron injuring C5b-9 membrane
attack complexes. We predict that genetic complement component deletion and pharmacological C5a
receptor blockade will accelerate recovery after limb fracture. In addition, we predict that the local injection
of injured mouse and human IgM will cause pain sensitization and functional loss in the involved limbs.
Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies will identify local complement activation and fiber loss.
 Chronic pain syndromes after injuries and surgery including CRPS have substantial pain, functional,
neuropsychiatric and financial consequences. Available treatments are poorly effective. At the conclusion of
these experiments we will be in position to design clinical protocols evaluating the impact of sympatholysis,
immunomodulation and anti-complement therapeutics on recovery from injury using clinically available tools
and ones currently in late stages of development."

This T32 renewal application for years 27-31 seeks continuing support for this exemplary Lung Biology and
Pathobiology Training Program at The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago. Our primary emphasis
continues to be in the training of the next generation of creative and meritorious lung researchers at the
predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. To support our goal of training in this rapidly-evolving and competitive
scientific environment, we have re-vitalized the program to encompass development of careers of individuals
seeking to become independent investigators as well as aspiring to research-related careers. The Program
continues to have a strong focus on fostering career development and promoting essential skills such as in
problem-solving skills and developing characteristics such as resilience and grit which are necessary for long-
term success in any research-intensive career. Our alumni move on to successful careers in academia, industry,
and related-fields. In addition to the cohort of stellar well-funded preceptors we have always had, we have
selectively replenished our faculty to provide to new training opportunities. Our Training Program covers five
complementary thematic areas: (1) Biology and Pathobiology of the Lung Vasculature, (2) Regenerative
Mechanisms in Lung and Vascular Biology, (3) Cellular and Humoral Basis of Lung Inflammation and Injury, (4)
Cell Signaling in Lung Injury, and (5) Lung and Vascular Genomics. The Program's vitality is reflected in the
numbers of highly qualified applicants applying and those we must decline. We anticipate an even greater
interest with the launch of new thematic areas, recruitment of exceptional faculty, and programs such as the
internally funded internship program and summer undergraduate research program to attract better trainees.
Therefore, we are requesting 7 predoctoral (as opposed to 6 PhD trainees currently) while maintaining 6
postdoctoral training positions. The Program is designed to provide mentoring by a primary preceptor, however
co-mentorship is encouraged. Trainees formulate Individual Development Plans with their mentor(s) and their
progress is carefully monitored throughout based on various systems and checks and balances in place. Thus,
we are poised with renewed vigor to train a select group of individuals in lung-related research and important
intersecting disciplines for careers in academia, research institutions, biopharmaceutical industry, and other
burgeoning areas."
10909822,"As SARS-CoV-2 vaccines enter mass distribution, little is known about vaccinated individuals who nonetheless
develop Covid-19 (symptomatic disease or “vaccine failure”), require hospitalization, and die. Pfizer-BioNTech
reported 3.8 vaccine failure cases/1,000 person-years, meaning vaccine failure will be relatively common on a
population level. Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen vaccine efficacy trials involved 35,000 to 50,000 individuals
from which there are insufficient numbers to study vaccine failure, calling for post-vaccination surveillance with
observational cohort studies in real-world settings. Using the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and the
Covid-19 Shared Data Resource, we can harness real-time data to design a forward-thinking, active
surveillance system to pragmatically study the epidemiology of vaccine failure. Our overarching goals in the
proposed VAccine Failure study are to characterize post-vaccination Covid-19 clinical outcomes and
identify factors associated with vaccine failure. Our central hypothesis is that adverse Covid-19 clinical
outcomes after vaccination will be increasingly common over time, driven by delayed vaccination, clinical
factors associated with weak or rapidly declining immune responses, and viral lineages accumulating escape
mutations. We propose to identify a national longitudinal cohort of all Veterans age >65 years who had a
primary care visit in the VA within the past 2 years and received at least 1 dose of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
(N>1.55 million Veterans). We will observe these Veterans for up to 3.5 years and ascertain diagnoses of
Covid-19 incidence or vaccine failure (acute SARS-CoV-2 infection + at least 1 symptom), hospitalization, and
mortality. We will leverage our extensive experience conducting observational cohort studies with VA and
Medicare data to emulate a target trial approach and achieve the following Aims, rooted in the epidemiological
triad: Aim 1. To describe and compare Covid-19 clinical outcomes by vaccine type and manufacturer in a
population-based national cohort of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated Veterans. Aim 2. To determine environmental
factors associated with vaccine failure. Aim 3. To determine host factors associated with vaccine failure. Aim
4. To determine agent factors associated with vaccine failure. To achieve Aim 4, we will use a case-control
study of 600 Veterans with Covid-19 to identify cases with the outcome of viral variant and perform density
sampling of controls from our SFVAHCS/VISN-21 catchment area, where we have access to banked remnant
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples. This project is uniquely positioned to provide the National VA Vaccine
Program with real-time evidence to rapidly adapt its vaccine delivery for Veterans (e.g., vaccine boosters for at-
risk groups; timing of next-generation vaccines) while filling the urgent national need for post-vaccination
surveillance in real-world settings."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) causes 1 in 20 deaths worldwide and imposes huge economic costs on
society. Twin studies have shown that the risk for developing AUD is heritable. Genome wide association
studies (GWAS) have indicated that, like most psychiatry diseases, AUD is highly polygenic. Although GWAS
in both humans and rodents are powerful techniques, with different strengths and weaknesses, techniques to
integrate the two are poorly developed. GWAS identify individual SNPs that influence a trait; because those
SNPs are species specific, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and similar approaches cannot be used to transfer
information across species. To address this limitation, we are proposing a framework for transferring polygenic
signals across species. We introduce the concept of polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS). Whereas
PRS sum the effects of many SNPs, a PTRS sums the effects of genetically predicted transcript abundance
across many genes. Because these effects are at the gene, rather than SNP level, they can be applied to
orthologous genes in other species. The extent to which a PTRS for AUD that was developed in humans might
predict rodent behaviors believed to be relevant to AUD is currently unknown. In this grant we will assess
whether PTRS can be used to translate polygenic signals related to AUD between humans and rodents. We
focus on AUD because of the existence of high quality human GWAS data about AUD and related traits like
alcohol consumption. In Aim 1, we will phenotype 1,250 HS rats for multiple alcohol self-administration traits.
In Aim 2, we will perform GWAS and transcriptome wide association analysis (TWAS) for alcohol-related traits
in the rats from Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will build PTRS for AUD and related traits and optimize them for portability
across species. These aims address a critical limitation, namely the inability to transfer polygenic knowledge
between species, which is inhibiting progress towards a deeper understanding of how polygenic liability for
AUD alters molecular and cellular processes, brain circuits and behaviors. If successful, our results will open
new avenues for research aimed at prediction, prevention, and treatment of AUD."

Stroke is a leading cause of death and permanent disability. Cardiovascular diseases are commonly
presented and are primary causes of death in stroke survivors. Numerous studies have proven the benefits
of walking or other forms of aerobic exercise for cardiovascular and pulmonary function in people after
stroke. Most of the past studies targeted stroke survivors with mild or moderate sensorimotor impairment
who can walk independently but did not include 22% or more of stroke survivors who remain non-
ambulatory despite intensive rehabilitation. Upright walking may be a superior intervention to improve
cardiovascular and pulmonary health in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors compared to sitting
exercises that are commonly used. Current clinical guidelines could not make a clear recommendation as
regarding to gait training for non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors because they have been rarely
enrolled in trials of gait training. Consequently, gait training is often not included in their rehabilitation plans
despite its tremendous potential. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines
recognize this gap in our knowledge and strongly encourage research to explore broader application and
effectiveness of assisted gait training in managing risk factors of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases in
non-ambulatory stroke survivors. To address this gap, the proposed randomized controlled efficacy trial will
primarily examine whether our gait training can improve cardiovascular system in non-ambulatory chronic
stroke survivors better than a sitting leg cycling exercise. We have recently developed a novel gait training
device and a training program. A detailed description of the technical advantages of our device and
promising pilot results of our gait training program are presented in the text of this application to support
our scientific rationale. Our primary aim is to investigate the efficacy of an 8-week gait training program in
comparison to an 8-week sitting leg cycling exercise program of a control group. Our primary hypothesis is
that the gait training will result in significantly different changes in a positive direction in resting heart rate
(rHR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than the sitting leg cycling
exercise in non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors, as demonstrated through a comparison between the
experimental and control groups. To accomplish this goal, 90 non-ambulatory chronic stroke survivors will
be recruited into the study. Individuals will be randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 45) or control (n =
45) group. The intervention group will receive three sessions of walking exercise each week for eight
weeks along with usual care. The subjects in the control group will receive a sitting leg cycling exercise
program. The proposed project will examine differences between the two groups in a set of comprehensive
outcome assessments of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and sensorimotor functions"

From a single fertilized egg, the human genome must regulate an incredible succession of cellular divisions and
fate decisions to give rise to the adult human body and its ~30 trillion cells [1]. The genome must also orchestrate
highly diverse functions in these terminal cell types and in many instances allow for dynamic responses to a
variety of stimuli - from white blood cells responding to stimulation [2] to hepatocytes responding to hormonal
cues [3]. Furthermore, developmental processes are asynchronous and continue for many cell types into
adulthood. Fundamental to our understanding of the causal links in all of these processes is the concept of time.
While time course studies have a long history in genomics [4], single-cell genomic technologies are providing
unprecedented views into the temporal dynamics of cellular differentiation and response at a genomic scale [5].
This will have widespread implications for our strategies of stem cell therapy, windows of intervention in disease
progression, and our basic understanding of developmental biology. However, these inferences are to-date
limited and rely on a concept called ‘pseudotime’ [5], which is difficult to validate and can be warped relative to
real time. To truly understand how the genome coordinates development, differentiation, and disease we need
new tools that allow us to better measure several key features of developmental trajectories: the ordering
of regulatory cascades, the duration of the key genomic events in developmental processes, and the
specific DNA sequences that can regulate temporal expression patterns. In order to address these
concerns, we will develop a new suite of tools that leverage single-cell readouts to better understand the
genomic regulation of time. In particular, we will focus on highly multiplexed assays to better understand the
necessary and sufficient ordering of regulatory cascades in differentiation pathways, assays to convert
pseudotime to real time, and genome scalable assays to identify and validate the exact regulatory
sequences that define temporal patterns of gene expression."

The Statistical Core complements and supports the aims of the Projects by aiming to:
 Aim 1: Provide data management expertise and coordination.
 Acquire, prepare, integrate, manage, secure, and archive data; advise on data use and quality.
 Aim 2: Coordinate analytic tasks and provide statistical expertise.
 Identify organizations and sites to sample; code common variables to be used in all Projects;

 and sensitivity analyses; perform cross-project analyses.
 Aim 3: Develop and apply novel methods for network analyses of health care delivery.
 Build a network of the cancer care delivery system, characterize its features, and develop and
 integrate novel network measures into Project analyses.
This Program Project’s unique combination of depth (each Project having specific expertise about their
provider organization types) and breadth (the Statistical Core mapping the whole network) provides
unprecedented opportunities to synthesize knowledge and advance our understanding of integration in the

instance, the Statistical Core will construct sampling frames for the Projects to survey provider organizations,
and the Projects will provide the Statistical Core with definitions of forms of integration to inform claims-based
measures. The Statistical Core will operationalize quality measures in administrative data, and the Projects will
study how these relate to integration in their specific segments of the delivery system.

Diet and nutrition are central to the treatment and prevention of many diseases. Diet is also a convenient, non-
invasive lever to manipulate the composition and physiology of the distal gut microbiome, a community of
nearly 100 trillion microorganisms that live in the ileum and colon of all humans. Although precise mechanisms
are still being unraveled, the microbiome is emerging as a contributor to many diseases, suggesting that diet-
mediated microbiome intervention is a fruitful but underdeveloped path to control some diseases. Dietary fibers
are mostly polysaccharides and are enriched in the edible plants (fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc.) that are
common in our diet and are directly degraded by some bacterial members of the microbiome. Some members
of the microbiome are also capable of consuming mucin glycoproteins, the largest component of secreted
mucus, which forms a protective barrier overlying the colonic epithelium. We and others have shown that
dietary fiber—the major nutrient category that escapes digestion in the upper intestine and therefore reaches
the microbiome—offsets colonic mucus erosion when eaten in sufficient quantities. Part of our working model
is that dietary fiber encourages growth of non-mucin-degrading bacteria by providing alternative nutrients.
However, we have also discovered that dietary fiber or fiber-derived simple sugars actively repress expression
of mucin utilization functions in the generalist bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). This repression
leads to reduced mucus erosion and less severe symptoms in a model of post allogeneic bone marrow
transplant graph versus host disease (GVHD). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that certain plant
foods are capable of delivering nutrients to Bt and other mucin-degrading bacteria, which offset their ability to
erode mucus and cause worse GVHD in transplant patients. Since Bt cannot directly access all of the fibers
available via diet, we further hypothesize that some repressive effects are indirect and dependent on the
presence and activity of other fiber degrading bacteria that release simple sugars consumed by Bt. We will test
our hypothesis using a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our focus on foods that contribute beneficial
fibers will be guided by direct measurements of the abilities of commonly consumed plant foods to repress Bt
mucus degradation in vitro, followed by separate tests of how the most repressive food items translate to
reduced mucus erosion in vivo in animal models and correlate with improved GVHD outcomes in patients. We
will focus our investigations on the effects of fibers contained in actual fruits, vegetables and other plant items,
providing an innovative approach that will better connect real foods with microbiome effects at a mechanistic
level. Finally, we will perform molecular genetic experiments in Bt to define the regulatory mechanisms through
which fiber-based nutrients cause suppression of mucin utilization. These experiments may reveal additional
targets in this regulatory pathway that can be manipulated by molecules other than dietary carbohydrates to
reduce mucus erosion in patients recovering from transplant."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease of the elderly that often transforms from pre-AML states of age-
related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms
(MPN). Traditional models ascribe this association to the slow process of acquiring mutations over time. Work
from our group suggests that functional declines in aging blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and
signals from the aging niche that alter the transcriptional milieu or promote expansion of HSC compartments
have an impactful role in myeloid disease progression by promoting clonal expansion of mutated (pre-leukemic)
HSCs and emergence of AML. These two aspects, genetic drift and HSC extrinsic events, are typically studied
separately. The goal of our program is to apply cutting edge genetic tools and single cell technology to integrate
studies of clonal mutational evolution and niche components in patients and mouse models, to establish the
mechanisms through which the aging marrow supports outgrowth of AML initiating clones. We have collected
data that led us to hypothesize that inflammatory, transcriptional and stromal niche pressures mounting in
the aging BM act on mutated pre-leukemic HSCs to promote their clonal outgrowth ultimately enabling
AML development from pre-AML states. To address this hypothesis our goals are to: 1. Establish the role
of transcriptional deregulation and environment-triggered inflammatory and stromal signals in AML
transformation. We will examine whether AML transformation from ARCH, MDS, MPN results from clonal
outgrowth of pre-leukemic HSCs through inflammation-induced activation of emergency myelopoiesis (EM)
facilitating HSC expansion; MDM4-induced β-catenin, IL-1 signaling and P53 inactivation; and stromal cell -
induced CNOT6L-mediated transcriptional deregulation in HSCs. Interactions among these pathways and their
independent vs. collective contribution to disease progression will be examined. Data from shared patient
samples and mouse models, single-cells analyses and functional screens will be integrated to identify targetable
pathways elicited by novel facilitators of clonal outgrowth. 2. Map human AML evolution at the mutational and
transcriptomic level and in the context of HSC intrinsic and niche factors using a patient sample cohort
analyzed at the single cell level for mutational and transcriptional status to establish a trajectory of AML
development in the context of aging and identify new regulatory nodes to target for clinical interventions.3:
Characterize the molecular profile of HSC populations implementing clonal outgrowth in AML and
determine how interactions between HSCs and specific niche populations affect transformation by
deconvoluting shared transcriptional signatures among specific BM and niche cell populations that will provide
new intervention paradigms. Our studies will deliver an integrated molecular and cellular characterization of
aging-related mechanisms implicated in AML progression, paving the way for the development of specific
therapeutic interventions aimed at curtailing AML transformation in patients with high risk ARCH, MDS and MPN."
10938305,"Project Summary. This award is sought to support the foundation of a research program that will broadly
capitalize on the unique properties of inorganic compounds to afford medicinal solutions that are complementary
to those accessible via traditional organic medicinal chemistry. The underlying philosophy of the research
program is that the historic and continued success of the medicinal chemistry enterprise derives from the diversity
of structures and reactivities that can be accessed using organic chemistry. This diversity notwithstanding, there
is a greater diversity of properties that can be accessed using inorganic compounds in addition to organic ones.
There will be instances in which the chemistry of inorganic substances, or the methodologies and approaches
of inorganic chemists, will allow problems to be solved that would otherwise remain intractable. During this award
period, the problems that will be tackled are: (i) the lack of an antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning, and (ii) a
gap in the understanding of the chemistry and biology of antimony-containing drugs that are widely used to treat
the neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis. The need for an antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning stems
from the fact that conventional oxygen administration cannot clear carbon monoxide from the body quickly
enough in cases of severe poisoning. My research group has previously obtained proof-of-principle data
indicating that a small-molecule iron-porphyrin platform can exhibit the chemistry needed by an antidote. I
propose to explore this modular platform to uncover the relationships that govern carbon monoxide sequestration
and biological efficacy. The parasitic disease leishmaniasis is widely treated with two antimony-containing drugs.
Although effective, treatment with these drugs is accompanied by severe side effects. Efforts to improve upon
these drugs are hampered by our lack of knowledge concerning their chemistry and biology. We have recently
demonstrated that a range of physical inorganic techniques can be used to gain insight into the chemistry of
antimony compounds, and we will apply these methods to the antileishmanial drugs. A particular focus will be
placed on uncovering the molecular structures of the drugs and their biotransformation products and establishing
spectroscopic signatures that will allow these transformations to be followed in complex biological media and
environments. Although distinct, these two areas of investigation both center on problems that require a
combined expertise in fundamental inorganic chemistry, medicinal bioinorganic chemistry, and biological
chemistry. My past training, complemented by key collaborations, will allow me to establish an impactful research
program in medicinal inorganic chemistry."

 GLIA IN HEALTH & DISEASE
 August 20 – 24, 2024
Abstract
The proposed meeting on Glia in Health & Disease will be held August 20 – 24, 2024 at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory. The goal of this conference is to provide an active forum for exchange of results in the rapidly
advancing fields of glial biology and neuron-glia interactions. Glial cells comprise a diverse group of non-
neuronal cells that are essential for nervous system development, circuit function, and disease. Glia perform
many important roles, such as regulating the development of neural circuits, modulating neurotransmitter
signaling between neurons, providing metabolic support to many nervous system cells, supporting the fast and
efficient propagation of action potentials, modulating vascular development and blood flow, and regulating the
propagation of pathology and inflammatory cascades in disease. With the advancement of genetic tools to
specifically target glia, we are now gaining a deeper mechanistic understanding of how glial cells function in
health and disease. This includes mechanisms highlighting glia actively modulate neural circuit function,
plasticity, and behavior under healthy, steady-state conditions. We are also now appreciating how these
functions go awry in pathological states, leading to circuit dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and destruction of
neurons and their synaptic connections. There are also clear indications that glia may not only react to
diseased neurons to propagate disease, but they are a part of the underlying etiology. For example, many
gene mutations linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, are
in genes enriched in glia. Further genetic manipulation studies are beginning to reveal how these mutations
alter glial cell function and contribute actively to the earliest initiation and propagation of these diseases.
Adding to the complexity in disease, glia can also be beneficial and promote regeneration and tissue repair by
performing functions such as providing metabolic support, engulfing debris, and forming protective glial scars.
This meeting will highlight the latest developments in glial cell biology obtained through studies of invertebrate
and vertebrate model systems, as well as human tissue and cells, using the most up-to-date genetics,
molecular biology, biochemistry, physiology, and imaging technologies. Using the goals and format of the
previous nine extremely successful meetings as a guide, we will: 1) assemble a diverse meeting of scientists
engaged in studies of glial biology and neuron-glia interactions; 2) showcase the newest and most exciting
developments through talks selected based on scientific merit from openly submitted abstracts; 3) empower
junior scientists to present their work and engage with established investigators; and 4) foster collaborations for
accelerated discovery."
10905445,"Progressive accumulation and misfolding of tau are critical drivers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other related diseases. Increasing evidence from tauopathy studies
suggests that dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) plays a major role in these diseases. Under
normal conditions, the ALP is responsible for maintaining proteostasis by degrading and recycling damaged
organelles and misfolded proteins. A full understanding of ALP dysregulation in tauopathies is increasingly within
reach, but first requires new tools that can monitor temporal changes in the pathway in human neurons. The
currently available cellular biosensors that are commonly used to track ALP dysfunction only offer static
snapshots of individual components of the ALP, (e.g., autophagosome number, lysosomal acidification) limiting
their capacity to elucidate how tau perturbs the complex and delicately balanced dynamics of this system.
To remedy this, we have developed two complementary fluorescence-based biosensors that report on real-
time nuclear translocation and dimerization of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of autophagy
and lysosomal biogenesis. The first biosensor monitors subcellular TFEB localization using high-content
imaging; the second biosensor uses high-resolution time-resolved FRET measurements that sensitively report
on TFEB dimerization. Using these biosensors, which have not previously been reported in the tau field, we have
already shown that: 1) tau induces pathological translocation of TFEB into the nucleus; 2) mutant tau alters
nuclear import kinetics of TFEB; and 3) TFEB activation involves its homo-dimerization in the nucleus. To prove
the feasibility of these tools, we did the initial optimizations in highly scalable model cell systems (N2a and
HEK293 cell lines), but we recognize that those are not sufficient models for tauopathy or for future applications
of the technology. Thus, this proposal takes the critical next steps in the engineering of these TFEB biosensors
by translating them into human iPSC (hiPSC) glutamatergic neurons from healthy and AD/FTD patient lines.
We will exploit our patented rapid differentiation protocol to generate hiPSC glutamatergic neurons expressing
our TFEB biosensors. We will then establish the baseline for native TFEB dynamics under non-stressed
conditions. Having done so, we will investigate perturbations induced by known small molecule effectors of tau
and ALP (including torin1 and forskolin). Lastly, we will study a limited set tau of mutations using AD/FTD patient
derived hiPSC lines (Tau Consortium) to classify which most strongly compromise TFEB function in neurons.
Establishing this new technology is significant because it will: 1) enable future studies elucidating biological
connections between ALP dysfunction and tauopathy; and 2) will provide a platform for the first high-throughput
screening campaigns that target tau-induced deficits in the most vulnerable, rate-limiting steps of the ALP."
10907964,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide rates among adolescents have increased over the past decade. During this same time period, social
media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now
using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is
likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors
(STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for
STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach,
integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific
mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~
2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescents, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify
specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social
media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed
using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye-tracking will be
used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs.
Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline and 6-month follow up, with suicide-related hospital visits
tracked over 12 months. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of
becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this
research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning
methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-
based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on
training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors
and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth
suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms.
The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful
completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study
has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent
suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to
become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use."
10907967,"Project Summary/Abstract
We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by
virtue of activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that
cause us to eat more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more
interesting: a taste hits the tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing
food-related information back and forth as the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is
palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this process by recording from multiple parts of the
taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes. We have observed this decision-
making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report, in turn, that a taste is
on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the taste; this last
step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in the
rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves
and requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do
rigorous tests of where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles
played by amygdala and hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level
mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole, this research project has the potential to
completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in new thinking about perception
in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given the complexity of
brain circuitry."

The 2024 Gordon Research Conference on Mutagenesis will explore cutting edge research into the mechanisms
and consequences of changes in the genomic sequence of organisms across species. Despite being a well-
established conference, “Mutagenesis” remains a forefront topic, bridging the traditional boundaries of many
fields that do not usually interact with each other. Alterations to the genetic blueprint of an organisms drives
many aspects of biology such as viral restriction and effective adaptive immunity and can have serious
pathological consequences such as antimicrobial resistance development, aging and related diseases, to driving
cancer, and dampening the effectivity of anti-cancer therapeutics. Importantly, common molecular mechanisms
link these apparently diverse processes. To explore critical mutagenesis mechanisms, the meeting will highlight
a wide range of experimental approaches from basic genetic and molecular approaches, to deep sequencing
and single molecule biophysics, bringing together scientists of all career stages and backgrounds. The GRC will
comprise of 27 invited speakers (junior and senior), 28 slots for talks to be selected from the abstracts, as well
as an interactive poster session which will be summarized orally by the presenter in two “flash talk” presentations.
In addition, the GRS, which precedes the main conference will have further oral and poster presentation
opportunities specifically for graduate students and post-docs, as well as a career panel discussion. A ‘power
hour’ in the main meeting will focus on the challenges facing women in science, the usage of appropriate
pronouns (and the LGBT+ community), and navigating communication-related challenges between trainees and
mentors. We aim to foster an interactive, friendly environment in which ideas can be freely exchanged
independently of background or seniority. To that end, the sessions and working meals will be supplemented
with a vigorous social program to foster these interactions. The GRC program will be organized into nine morning
and evening sessions titled: (1) Critical mutagenesis mechanisms (Keynote session); (2) Replication fork-
associated mutations (3) DNA damage and mutagenesis (4) Transcription associated mutagenesis (5) The
influence of DNA sequence on mutagenesis (6) Mutagenesis mechanisms in cancer (7) How exogenous and
endogenous DNA damage leads to mutagenesis (8) Barrier induced mutagenesis and (9) The ultimate
consequences of mutations and evolution. The GRC and GRS will thus promote exchange of the latest ideas
and techniques in the broad field of mutagenesis and drive new ideas and cross-field collaborations while
enhancing and promoting the careers of the next generation of scientists in this exciting and important field."
10905663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The 2024 Gordon Research Conference on Membrane Transporters titled “New Insights into Structure,
Function, and Regulation of Critical Membrane Transport Proteins in Health and Disease” will bring an urgently
needed translational focus to research on clinically relevant and highly druggable membrane transporters.
Although they account for 10% of the human genome and are critical proteins involved in both highly prevalent
(autism, depression, diabetes), as well as orphan and rare diseases (Christianson syndrome, mucoviscidosis
and Episodic Ataxia), recent data indicate that membrane transporters represent potential therapeutic targets.
The goal in organizing this conference is to link molecular and mechanistic insights on clinically important
membrane transporters expressed in different tissues, including carriers, ion channels, and pumps, to
physiological function and disease-related dysfunction. The intent is to offer and discuss opportunities for the
development of pharmacotherapies targeting transporter dysfunctions in disease states. The program will
include talks from both established and early-career researchers and there are speaking slots reserved for
students and postdoctoral researchers that will be selected from submitted the abstracts. Nine highly
interdisciplinary scientific sessions are bringing together topics, approaches and novel ideas that are not
conventionally related. These range from genetics of transporter and ion channels in disease states, to
unconventional animal models to study transporters, or approaches such as single-molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer and transcranial magnetic stimulation. This prevents the perception of a single
approach or topic dominating the conference and amplifies opportunities for discussion of new ideas. New
topics have been introduced (e.g., lipid transporters, plant, microbe and pathogen transporters, transporter
dysfunction in metabolism and obesity, as well as new perspectives from Pharma and Industry). Ample
discussion time after each talk, daily posters, and afternoon free time allow for informal discussion, networking
and forming new collaborations. In addition, a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Membrane Transport
Proteins will be held immediately prior to the conference. The GRS, organized by trainee scientists, will provide
an additional forum to highlight research, network with colleagues, as well as to discuss challenges of the early
career stages. We have invited a diverse group of speakers and will offer travel awards to underrepresented in
STEM scientists who apply to the meeting. Finally, we have secured Dr. Rajini Rao, Professor of Physiology at
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as the Discussion Leader for the GRC Power Hour. Dr. Rao has been a
strong advocate for equity, diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and is
a well-respected mentor and advocate for trainees."
10908265,"Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA) involve abnormal
accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn). Although it has been nearly two centuries since PD was
first described, a dearth of biomarkers has greatly impeded progress toward development of disease-modifying
treatments and accurate and early diagnosis. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that pathology in these
diseases propagates through the brain via a mechanism in which transcellular movement of misfolded α-syn
protein aggregates or “seeds” occurs. There is also evidence that pathogenic α-syn has diverse structures in
diseases such as PD or MSA, that may underlie the clinical and pathologic differences seen in these
synucleinopathies. This proposal utilizes a novel cell-based assay that has been shown to detect and quantify
abnormal α-syn seeding activity that differs both biochemically and structurally in brain extracts from patients
with PD and MSA. In this project we propose to (1) optimize the ability to detect aggregated forms of α-syn
utilizing genetic manipulation of a cell-based sensor, (2) utilize cutting edge molecular and imaging techniques
to parse out differences between α-syn in the synucleinopathies MSA and PD, and (3) determine whether α-syn
seeding activity in blood components of patient samples can serve as a marker for clinical disease progression.
The implications of this work include facilitation of diagnosis and therapeutics for patients with PD and MSA.
The applicant is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at University of Kentucky, who is firmly
committed to an academic career as an independent translational scientist in the area of neurodegenerative
disease. The proposed training will take advantage of the rich and collaborative environment at the VA, the
excellent clinical documentation and records system, and the very relevant patient population affected by these
diseases and followed in clinic at the VA: all are factors that are integral and crucial to the success of this
proposal. Training will be conducted under the direction of an experienced mentor team. Dr. John Slevin, will be
the primary mentor, and has over 40 years of expertise in clinical research in Movement Disorders and holds a
Merit Award at the VA in basic science research. Dr. Sidney Whiteheart and Dr. Haining Zhu will serve as co-
mentors. They are experts in platelet biochemistry and abnormal protein aggregation, respectively, hold Merit
Awards in their fields, and are also faculty in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at University
of Kentucky. These mentors have been specially selected to advance the candidate’s knowledge of molecular
techniques for investigating aggregated proteins in peripheral fluids of patients with movement disorders.
Training during this proposal includes advanced genetic, molecular, and imaging-based techniques for protein
amplification and detection, and techniques for isolation and analysis of exosomal and platelet fractions from
whole blood. These components will be essential to completing the applicant’s immediate goal of developing a
biomarker that can detect and differentiate between synucleinopathies in peripheral samples by utilizing
differences in α-syn seeding activity. The comprehensive training program will position the applicant to conduct
independent research in the study of novel biomarkers in PD and related neurodegenerative disease."
10908268,"Ischemic injury to the kidney and other organs is deadly and expensive. Ischemic acute kidney injury
(AKI) occurs in up to two thirds of intensive care patients and 1 in 5 hospitalized adults with ~1.7 million of
these patients dying annually. The very high mortality in AKI, however, is NOT caused by renal failure per se.
Epidemiological and clinical data support the critical role of AKI-associated distant organ dysfunction in poor
outcomes and mortality in AKI. AKI also can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), progression of CKD to
end stage renal disease (ESRD) and kidney transplant failure. While AKI and CKD are onerous, the transition
to ESRD can be particularly perilous; mortality rates in Veterans (~40%) are huge in the first 90 days of
ESRD care. AKI has no current treatment; thus, effective AKI therapy is an important unmet medical need.
 The robust, prompt inflammatory and oxidative stress response to renal ischemia has been well
documented by others and by us. Inflammation in remote organs has also been found after renal ischemia,
but the “crosstalk” between the injured kidney and remote organs is also not well understood. With Merit
Review funding, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of adult-cell based therapies in multiple models of
renal failure. Given the large benefits of relatively few cells, we hypothesized that extracellular vesicles (EV or
exosomes), a non-viral biologic, released from the transplanted cells were the therapeutic effector. We found
that renal EV were more effective than the originating cells, decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress and
improving renal function postischemia, even when given after renal failure was established. Others have
shown benefit with EV in renal injury models. We now propose to define the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxid-
ant effects of renal EV in the kidney and remote organs and determine the specific therapeutic cargo.
 Our long-term goal is the development of effective therapies to improve outcomes in Veterans with
renal insults. Our objective in this proposal is defining key mediators of benefit (including anti-inflammatory
and anti-oxidative molecules) in the kidney and remote organs that are improved by EV and determine the
“active ingredients” in EV cargo. Our central hypotheses are that renal EV provide a multi-faceted therapy for
renal ischemic injury, increasing renal superoxide and catalase and anti-inflammatory cytokines and that skin
and platelet EV do not decrease inflammation and are not protective. This will allow us to define the specific
beneficial cargo in renal EV. We will employ the powerful technique of spatial transcriptomics to examine the
changes with ischemia and improvements with EV. Furthermore, we posit that systemic and remote organ
inflammation result from ischemia and not uremia and can be improved with EV. Based on our preliminary
data, we propose the following aims to fill knowledge gaps in the mechanisms of renal injury and protection:
 1. To define the efficacy of extracellular vesicles from different sources on postischemic renal function,
 inflammation and oxidative stress. Preliminary data support efficacy of renal, but not platelet or skin EV.
 We will examine means (including ischemic preconditioning) to improve efficacy. We will also compare
 cargo and the effects on pathways of ischemic injury between beneficial renal EV and ineffective EV in
 order to define the essential therapeutic cargo components and most altered pathways of renal injury.
 2. To determine the effect of renal ischemia on inflammation and oxidative stress in remote organs and
 the effect of EV on inflammation and organ function following renal ischemia.
 At the conclusion of this work, we expect to have defined the key inflammatory and oxidative stress
mediators of ischemic renal injury, the effects of renal ischemia on inflammation in remote organs, other
specific mechanisms of benefit postischemia and the EV cargo that improve inflammation and renal function.
The results are expected to have a significant positive impact in that they will provide the strong evidence-
based proof of principle for further development of potential therapies to improve outcomes in AKI."

Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), a cancer epidemiology cohort of 51,529 U.S. male health professionals
age 40 to 75 years at baseline in 1986. This cohort is unique in its focus on men’s health and with 35 years
follow-up, provides a time frame essential to study modifiable risk factors for cancer incidence with realistic
latencies. Information has been regularly updated on diet, physical activity, smoking, weight, medications, and
other potentially modifiable determinants of cancer risk. The biorepository is key element of the cohort and
includes DNA, red blood cells, plasma, stool, and toenails. Tumor tissue has been obtained from 7,522 incident
cancers of the prostate, colon, bladder, kidney, and lung (nonsmokers), and hematologic cancers. Cohort
follow-up is consistently 90% at each two-year cycle and mortality follow-up is virtually complete. At present,
21,853 participants are living and at a heightened age of cancer incidence; these will be the most informative
cases given extensive exposure data since midlife. In the current grant, 492 papers were published that utilize
data and/or biological samples from HPFS; 317 of these specifically examined cancer or precursor outcomes
including >100 led by external investigators. To date, 17,091 participants have been diagnosed with cancer
and 4,704 cancer deaths have occurred; 7,061 men are currently living with a cancer diagnosis.
 In the next funding cycle, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. To actively follow-up for cancer
incidence and mortality; to update exposures pre- and post-diagnosis of cancer; Aim 2. To collect data on
quality of life, treatment, progression, and cannabis use among cancer survivors. Aim 3. To update the food
composition and nutrient databases that support the HPFS and external studies; to jointly calibrate dietary
questionnaires with the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) to support combined studies. Aim 4. To
maintain and expand the HPFS tissue biorepository to collect tissue from prostate, colon, lung, kidney, and
bladder cancers; to pilot artificial intelligence approaches to characterize morphologic features of prostate
tumors. Aim 5. To maintain other biorepositories including plasma, red blood cells, toenails, and germline
DNA. Aim 6. To expand linkage of geocoded addresses of HPFS and SCCS participants to assess longitudinal
measures of the built environment and neighborhood SES over three decades. Aim 7. To maintain and
augment the statistical infrastructure and data management to support HPFS analyses by internal and external
investigators; to develop new software to facilitate latency and competing risk analyses in HPFS and share
with external investigators. Aim 8. To facilitate resource sharing and collaborations with external investigators
and consortia, including the transfer of HPFS questionnaire datafiles onto a secure cloud environment. With
additional follow-up, including after cancer diagnosis, the HPFS remains ideally positioned to make innovative
contributions to our goal of reducing cancer burden by identifying primary and secondary prevention strategies."

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by
deposition of the protein 4-repeat (4R) tau in the brain. Patients typically present with postural instability with
falls, axial rigidity and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, although other atypical clinical syndromes occur in
which patients present with parkinsonism, freezing of gait, behavioral abnormalities, limb apraxia or speech
and language difficulties. In the 1st cycle of the R01 we characterized the cross-sectional and longitudinal
behavior of the tau-PET ligand [18F]AV-1451 in PSP and showed that it is related to other neuroimaging
measures of neurodegeneration. The 1st cycle focused on the typical clinical presentation of PSP. Since the 1st
cycle, a panel of leading experts published new criteria with a standard to diagnose the atypical clinical
syndromes. We currently lack understanding of the neurobiology of the atypical PSP syndromes. The primary
goal of the 2nd cycle is, therefore, to characterize the clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological
features across typical and atypical PSP syndromes. Specifically, we aim to characterize the cross-
sectional and longitudinal multi-modal neuroimaging signatures of the PSP syndromes, determine the
relationship between neuroimaging and clinical evolution, and evaluate the autopsy characteristics of the PSP
syndromes. We will have data from 160 PSP patients to allow us to address our aims (84 recruited into the 1st
cycle and 76 which will be recruited in the 2nd cycle). Each newly recruited patient will undergo the identical
examinations as the 84 patients from the 1st cycle, including a neurological and dysphagia evaluation, a 3T
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that includes structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and tau-
PET using the [18F]AV-1451 ligand. All patients will undergo two serial assessments one year apart. We will
assess differences and commonalities in all three neuroimaging modalities across PSP syndromes primarily
using a focused region-of-interest approach which will target key brainstem, subcortical and cortical regions
that are involved in PSP. We will then ascertain whether the PSP syndromes exhibit unique multi-modal
signatures using a classification model. Voxel-level analyses will also be performed to assess patterns across
the whole brain. The relationship between clinical evolution, including the evolution of dysphagia, and the PSP
syndromes and neuroimaging measures will be assessed. Autopsy examinations will be performed on all
patients from both cycles that die and 4R tau burden will be compared across PSP syndromes. We will also
determine the degree to which neuroimaging differences across syndromes are related to tau burden and
investigate how additional pathologies are associated with the different syndromes. The results of this grant will
increase our knowledge of the neural underpinnings of the clinical and anatomical heterogeneity in PSP and
will also be essential for the development of optimum biomarkers for PSP that will aid diagnosis, track disease
progression and allow patients with all PSP syndromes to be included in future treatment trials."
10908356,"Accurate non-invasive biomarkers are urgently needed to identify which patients with hormone
receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer will respond to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Lack of
direct knowledge of the endocrine sensitivity of each patient’s breast cancer impedes optimal,
tailored therapy. Without a more personalized approach, many women and men will continue to
suffer from the current morbidity and mortality of breast cancer. The overall objective of the
proposed clinical trial is to investigate the ability of quantitative, hybrid functional imaging for
assessing hormonal sensitivity, estrogen receptor (ER) functional inhibition, and early response
to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The long-term goal is to develop functional imaging
approaches to directly test tumor sensitivity to endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients for
individualized treatment plans and improved outcomes. The proposed research will investigate
early changes in expression of a classic estrogen-regulated target gene as a surrogate measure
of endocrine sensitivity: progesterone receptor (PR) using a progestin-based radioligand, 21-
[18F]fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) and quantitative simultaneous breast positron
emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). The central hypothesis is that
FFNP uptake in primary breast tumors will show dynamic changes in response to presurgical
endocrine therapy, which will correlate with treatment response and exceed inherent technical
variability. The proposed clinical trial is a prospective, single-center study that will enroll women
with newly diagnosed ER+/PR+/HER2- invasive breast cancer who will undergo simultaneous
breast PET/MRI with FFNP before and after a short course of endocrine therapy prior to surgical
excision. The study aims to determine 1) the efficacy of FFNP PET/MRI for predicting response
to presurgical endocrine therapy and 2) the quantitative reliability of FFNP breast PET/MRI. The
proposed research is innovative because it will use functional imaging with simultaneous breast
PET/MRI to improve the success of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Imaging treatment-induced
changes in estrogen-regulated signaling events, using FFNP PET/MRI, will have a significant
positive impact by enabling early assessment of endocrine therapy response mediated through
ER before changes in tumor size can be measured using conventional techniques such as
mammography, ultrasound, and palpation. Once validated, this approach can easily be
integrated into the preoperative evaluation of patients with primary HR+ breast cancer to
individualize neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment plans for improved patient outcomes."

Identifying causal disease variants and elucidating how they lead to chronic disease remain important
challenges in medicine. Genome-wide association studies have shown that polymorphisms associated with
different human chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes map
predominantly to noncoding cis-regulatory regions of immune cells. Recent work has shown that a substantial
fraction of non-coding variants linked to autoimmune disease lie in cis regulatory elements (CREs) of T
lymphocytes, a subset of immune cells that play vital roles in preserving self-tolerance and preventing
autoimmunity. However, determining which specific genes are regulated by CREs remains a challenge due to
the temporal and spatial contexts in which they are modulate gene expression and the lack of suitable models
to assess their activity in a manner that preserves their native chromatin structure. Importantly, T cells from
autoimmune patients also exhibit marked changes in DNA methylation. However, the link between epigenetic
changes and disease-associated variants is unclear. Our work has shown that T cells undergo significant
epigenetic programming via DNA demethylation in the thymus and this programming is essential for long-term
gene regulation in T cells. Remarkably, we have found that CREs active during T cell development play a
critical role in modulating these epigenetic changes. Furthermore, we have shown that a significant number of
genes that have critical roles in regulation of signals received the T cell receptor, which is essential for proper T
cell function, are programmed in this manner. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate how CREs modulate
epigenetic programming in genes with long-term functionality during thymic development and to define their
contribution in chronic diseases. We propose a new model to test how human CREs in which disease-
associated variants are present, modulate gene expression during thymic development and affect long-term
epigenetic programming. We propose a new conceptual framework and mouse models to then investigate the
mechanisms by which these CREs alter T cell function and promote chronic disease. Finally, we will
investigate the involvement of newly discovered molecular factors that facilitate DNA demethylation during T
cell maturation in the thymus. Understanding these mechanisms not only offers crucial insights into the
aberrations of normal gene function in T cell driven diseases but also presents opportunities for the
development of innovative approaches to enhance treatments for these illnesses. The comprehensive
strategies outlined in this proposal will not only establish the foundation for future investigations into non-
coding disease variants in autoimmune disorders driven by T cells but also offer a conceptual framework and
new models for future investigations into disease-related variants that are prevalent in other cell types such as
B cells.

Complex diseases are driven by intricate interactions among various cell types present at the disease sites.
Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics have enabled
cell-type-specific characterization of molecular phenotypes at the RNA-level. However, systematic profiling of
the protein-level dysregulation for different cell types remains a technical challenge. Addressing this unmet need
is critical for developing and optimizing therapeutic strategies, as proteins constitute the majority of clinical
biomarkers and druggable targets. In recent years, advanced mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has
been applied to primary bulk disease samples to detect genome-wide protein expression and modifications.
Moreover, by simultaneously profiling the disease samples via next generation sequencing (NGS), a new
multiomics field, “proteogenomics”, has enabled deeper understanding of biological regulations at different
molecular levels. Our previous studies have demonstrated the values proteogenomics data in understanding the
functional consequences of genetic abnormalities and elucidating signaling pathway cascades. However, due
to the moderate sensitivity of MS and the high requirement of NGS read depth, proteogenomics data are mostly
generated from bulk disease samples and lack firsthand information about constituent cell types. In this project,
our goal is to develop innovative computational approaches to infer the cell-type-specific protein phenotypes
from MS-based proteogeomics data. First, for canonical proteins annotated by public databases, we will develop
a data deconvolution pipeline to infer their cell-type-specific expression and active modifications. Second, we
will create a proteogenomics pipeline to identify noncanonical peptides and proteins and map them to their cell
type of origin. Of note, our computational approaches will address the unique challenges in MS proteomic data
quantification and leverage the integrative nature of the proteogenomics data analysis. We will create two data
portals, CellPathDb and cskAtlas, to host our methods and inferred results from current proteogenomic datasets.
These data portals will enable interactive queries of cell-type-specific protein phenotypes for experimental
biologists and clinical researchers."
10938280,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than one third of the approximately 2 million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year experience
moderate to severe pain related to their disease and/or its treatment. To date, 38 states and the District of
Columbia have adopted medical cannabis laws, and 24 have subsequently adopted adult-use (i.e.,
“recreational”) cannabis use laws, that enable patients with cancer to use cannabis for pain management.
Clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of cannabis to manage cancer pain, citing limited and
mixed evidence. Instead, guidelines continue to emphasize opioid therapy as a cornerstone of cancer pain
management. The strength of such consensus varies somewhat across cancer contexts. Consensus on the
appropriateness of opioid therapy is strongest for patients with advanced (i.e., incurable) cancer, especially
those with limited life expectancy. It is also strong for patients undergoing active cancer treatment with curative
intent. In contrast, guidelines for chronic pain management among cancer survivors (i.e., those who have
completed curative treatment and are in remission) reflect an emerging emphasis on opioid-sparing
approaches. Regardless of guideline recommendations, many patients with cancer prefer to limit or avoid
using opioids. In this context and based on prior studies documenting rates of cannabis use exceeding 25%
among patients with cancer, cannabis laws could lead patients to use cannabis in place of opioid therapy, with
downstream effects that are unknown and may differ across cancer contexts. The objective of the proposed
study is to address evidence gaps about the effects of state cannabis laws on pain management practices
(e.g., receipt of opioid therapy) and outcomes (e.g., receipt of treatment for opioid and cannabis use disorder;
patient-reported pain) in cancer. We will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of state cannabis laws using
a unique combination of two existing population-based data sources (SEER-Medicare and SEER-MHOS). We
will also collect and analyze survey and interview data to explore how state cannabis laws have influenced
cancer pain management from the perspectives of cancer center leaders, physicians, and patients.
Triangulating results from our policy evaluation with information about cancer center-level implementation of
state cannabis laws, physicians’ practices for recommending, and patients’ practices for using cannabis for
cancer pain will strengthen the validity of observed policy effects. Each year, states consider, enact, and/or
amend cannabis laws. To inform this rapidly evolving policy context, it is essential to understand how these
laws affect pain management for patients with cancer as one of the largest groups of consumers of therapeutic
cannabis. Our proposed study has significant potential to impact policy and practice."

 Primary cilia mediate transduction of all major signaling pathways, which in turn modulate cilia
morphology and functional outputs. The research in my lab is focused on identifying new genes and mapping
signaling networks that regulate cilia assembly during development and cilia remodeling in response to
environmental stress at single-cell resolution in vivo. To pursue these research questions, we use sophisticated
molecular genetics, proteomics, and live imaging approaches in C. elegans with complementary studies in
mammalian cell culture models. In the next five years, we propose to address three research goals. A first
major goal is to define molecular mechanisms that regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling during cilia
morphogenesis. Heterotrimeric G proteins and their canonical activators G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
localize to cilia, modulate cilia morphology, and when disrupted cause genetic disorders in humans. Key
outstanding questions that we propose to address are: What conserved and species-specific mechanisms
regulate ciliary trafficking of heterotrimeric G proteins? How do non-canonical, GPCR-independent
mechanisms modulate functions of ciliary G proteins? A second major goal is to determine in vivo mechanisms
that regulate and mediate cilia remodeling in response to stress. After exposure to environmental stress,
primary cilia undergo structural remodeling, which is associated with altered signaling output. We want to know
how stress modulates signaling capacity of cilia in vivo. What are the stress- and cell-specific mechanisms of
stress-induced cilia dynamics? A third major goal is to identify new conserved genes and pathways in cilia
morphogenesis and function. Cell- and tissue-specific differences in the ciliogenic programs are not well
understood, and the causative genes for many ciliopathy cases are unknown. For example, nearly 40 percent
of individuals with neurodevelopmental ciliopathies are estimated to be without genetic diagnosis. We want to
harness the power of bioinformatic approaches and C. elegans genetics to ask – what are the developmental
mechanisms that operate in cell-specific contexts to assemble cilia? Collectively, these projects will generate
fundamental insight into cell-specific signaling networks that regulate cilia assembly, remodeling, and cilia-
mediated cellular functions. This knowledge is an important steppingstone toward better understanding of the
genetic basis of ciliopathies, and more broadly, of mechanisms that allow cells to communicate with their
environment. This award would also allow us to recruit and train a diverse pool of researchers, launch new
collaborations, and follow new hypotheses that emerge in the course of this study."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) causes severe morbidity as plaques obstruct blood flow, preventing adequate
perfusion to limbs, which may result in amputation or death. There are one million interventions to treat PAD per
year, emphasizing the high prevalence of this disease. The preferred treatment is percutaneous vascular
interventions (PVI), where vessel plaque is penetrated and threaded (crossed) by a guidewire, followed by a
balloon over the wire and/or other adjunctive devices to open the blood vessel. Unfortunately, PVI fails
immediately for 20% of patients because the plaque proves impenetrable -- meaning patients are put at risk for
no health benefit. Furthermore, after ballooning open there is damage to the vessel wall and vessels block again
within a year for 70% of patients with below-the-knee plaques. These failures then require additional invasive
interventions. The difficulties with PVI are frustrating for the clinicians performing the surgery and needlessly
risky for our patients. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge in how to select patients that benefit from PVI
and how different preparation devices alter vessel wall injury. We propose a two-pronged approach: 1) improve
patient selection for PVI using a novel MRI-histology based anatomic scoring system that identifies patients with
impenetrable plaques; and 2) improve device selection by identifying devices that reduce vessel wall injury during
PVI using histopathologic analysis after PVI in a cadaveric model. Our preliminary data show that our in vivo
MRI-histology method can visualize hard plaque components (both calcium and dense collagen) to decipher
individual patients' plaque morphology and determine which plaques are penetrable. Furthermore, our cadaveric
model indicates differences in vessel wall injury following different preparation devices using detailed ex vivo
plaque analysis post-intervention. Our Specific Aims are:
1. Establish a novel MRI-histology anatomic scoring system that predicts PVI immediate technical failure to
improve patient selection for PVI. We will image patients prior to their PVI with our clinical MRI-histology protocol
to prospectively score individual patients’ plaques to predict successful guidewire crossing.
2. Describe the benefits of using orbital atherectomy before balloon angioplasty versus using balloon angioplasty
alone for various plaque types in arteries below the knee. We will randomize amputated legs from PAD patients
with calcified below-the-knee arteries to undergo plain balloon angioplasty versus atherectomy preparation
device prior to angioplasty. Pre-procedure 3T MRI-histology, intravascular ultrasound, and ex vivo plaque
analysis with histology, will determine vessel wall injury between intervention groups.
We will establish a patient selection process for PVI and define vessel wall response with ballooning only versus
vessel preparation with atherectomy through histologic analysis of cadaveric lesions. Our study will empower
clinical decision-making toward the safest, most effective strategies to ultimately save patient limbs and lives."

Obesity increases the risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). Indeed, epidemiological studies have found a strong link
between a poor diet and colorectal cancer and experimental studies in mice substantiate these claims. Because
adiposity and diet drive metabolic dysregulation, we posit that understanding the interaction between diet and
adiposity are key to understanding the genesis of CRC (as well as other obesity-related cancers). The
insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which is dysregulated in obesity and functions on a pro-
inflammatory substrate, is a major determinant in the pathogenesis and progression of CRC. Low-grade, chronic
systemic inflammation (i.e., meta-inflammation) associated with obesity – is inextricably linked to these metabolic
derangements. Indeed, inflammatory mediators contribute to metabolic dysfunction, including increases in
circulating cytokines, decreases in protective factors like adiponectin, and communication between inflammatory
and metabolic cells. Consumption of pro-inflammatory, energy-dense, often high-fat diets modulate microbiota
and induce alterations in intestinal barrier function that is associated with an increase in low-grade inflammation
and insulin resistance. Thus, gut microbes are likely at the epicenter of the obesity-meta-inflammation-CRC link.
Diet is the most influential factor on gut microbe composition and function and therefore presents a strategy for
intervention including natural products as dietary supplements. Cannabinoids have received recent attention for
their potential health benefits. In fact, the NCI is supporting research on the potential for cannabinoids in cancer
related outcomes. Excitingly, preliminary data that we have collected shows that cannabis administered to obese
mice improves the homeostasis model of risk assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and reduces adipose
tissue inflammation and pro-inflammatory macrophages without changes in body weight. These outcomes have
been associated with CRC progression and have been linked to changes to the gut microbiome. As such, this
Diversity Supplement will test the hypothesis that the cannabis plant can reduce meta-inflammation and
subsequent metabolic dysfunction in obesity-associated CRC, and this will be mediated via its actions on gut
microbes. Under this award Christian will 1) achieve training in cutting edge techniques related to metabolic
dysregulation and cancer risk including extensive training in mouse models of cancer, in immune profiling, and
in assessing microbiome and metabolite signatures, as well as in professional development training; 2) publish
1 first author paper and 2 co-author papers for each year of the award; 3) achieve training in career development;
and 4) contribute to the MeDOC consortium. Funding from this Diversity Supplement, mentoring from Dr. Murphy
and support from the other REMEDY investigators (advisory committee: Drs. Hebert, Hofseth, Velazquez,
Kubinak, and Li), the MeDOC consortium, and the resources at the University of South Carolina will allow
Christian to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on metabolic dysregulation and
cancer risk."

Prenatal screening for genetic conditions (PGS) has changed the landscape of prenatal care by offering
noninvasive indication of some fetal genetic conditions. PGS should be clearly distinguished from prenatal
diagnostic testing using microarray analysis of amniotic fluid, which is considered the gold standard for fetal
genetic assessment. While other routine screens are not held to the standard of fully informed consent, the ethics
literature on PGS, from maternal serum screening to cell-free DNA and other technologies, has argued that PGS
requires higher levels of consent based on the exceptional nature of its informational impacts, including potential
abortion decisions based on fetal characteristics. Multiple studies examining the patient experience have
described or proactively expressed concern at the routinization of PGS, including insufficient pre-test counseling
and ethical reflection on whether PGS was the right approach for the patient and family, consistent with their
values on disability and abortion. However, our own research on the implementation of PGS in low-resource
settings in the U.S. has found that there are few resources to attempt, let alone achieve, fully informed consent
prior to screening. Furthermore, for the great majority of pregnancies that do not receive a high-probability PGS
screen, attempting fully informed consent introduces mental and psychological stress on pregnant individuals
that may be unnecessary and undesirable. Patients who receive screen-positive results do require extensive
information and support for pregnancy and parenting decision-making, but they represent a tiny minority of all
those screened. Thus, we argue that a model of just-in-time consent (JITC) for PGS, incorporating simple
consent with shared decision-making, better fulfills the goals of prenatal screening and locates intense moral
decision-making in a more appropriate place in the pregnancy journey. JITC acknowledges the increased moral
weight that prenatal screening may have over other routine screens without burdening pregnant individuals and
health systems with unnecessary consent procedures. We propose a clinical trial over three demographically
and geographically diverse sites that serve a large pregnant population from historically underserved
communities to compare a novel JITC mechanism to current care. Our Aims are: (1a) Conduct community
engaged research with patients and providers to understand the necessary components of JITC for PGS; (1b)
Design and pilot a mobile-based intervention to deliver knowledge elements necessary for JITC for cfDNA; (2)
Using a stepped-wedge design, implement the mobile-based intervention at three diverse sites and evaluate
outcomes of feasibility and decisional satisfaction; and (3) Develop data-based, ethically informed
recommendations regarding implementation of a just-in-time consent model for patients receiving high risk PGS
screening test results."

The mammalian circadian system regulates metabolic processes over a 24-hour cycle and molecular circadian
clocks control functional tissue specific and cell autonomous oscillations. Adipocytes, the primary cell type in
adipose tissue, are central to regulating free fatty acid metabolism; dysregulation of free fatty acid release from
adipocytes (i.e. lipolysis) is central to the pathophysiology of obesity and contributes to lipotoxicity in other
tissues such as pancreas, liver, and muscle. Shift workers have disruptions in the circadian system and are at
increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease. Adipocytes have a cell autonomous cycling molecular
circadian clock and the literature suggests that adipocyte metabolism and lipolysis pathways are regulated by
cell intrinsic circadian rhythms that are altered in obesity. However, adipocytes are highly responsive to both
nutrient delivery and systemic hormonal signals driven by intermittent meal intake, making many secreted
adipocyte products appear rhythmic over a 24 h fasting/feeding cycle. Therefore, the relative control of adipose
tissue by feeding versus molecular clock driven mechanisms in humans is not understood. As such, the overall
goal of this application is to define the molecular and systemic role of intrinsic adipocyte molecular circadian
clock and how this is impacted by obesity in humans. In this context, Aim 1 will establish whether human
subcutaneous adipose tissue exhibits autonomous systemic and molecular circadian rhythmicity independent
of diurnal nutrient delivery in vivo in normal weight humans. Aim 2 will interrogate whether obesity alters
adipocyte specific rhythms in circadian and lipolysis genes and is related to measures of systemic adipose
tissue function. Finally, Aim 3 will interrogate the impact of feeding regime and obesity on the adipocyte
specific cistrome of core circadian clock transcription factors allowing a more complete understanding of
genomic regulation of adipocyte clock. This work will be the first work to address the relative contribution of
intrinsic adipocyte circadian clock during continuous feeding versus adipocyte function driven by intermittent
food intake in humans and interrogate circadian clock in the context of obesity. Answering these fundamental
questions is essential to understanding whether disruptions in circadian molecular clocks contribute to
metabolic abnormalities in obesity and these studies will provide a regulatory paradigm for circadian clock in
adipocytes. Importantly, these proposed research activities with an outstanding mentorship team and the
intellectually enriching environment at Mayo Clinic will build upon the applicant’s training and provide
opportunities to expand her clinical translational knowledge and skillset culminating in the development of a
research niche for the applicant."

 Dental care-related fear, anxiety, and/or phobia (hereafter, DFA) traditionally refers to the emotional,
behavioral, and/or physical responses that may occur when thinking about or engaging in dental care. There is
ample evidence in the scientific literature that DFA is associated with greater prevalence of oral conditions and
diseases, including dental caries, tooth loss, and periodontal disease, leads to avoidance of both preventive
and restorative dental care, and impairs oral health-related quality of life. Moreover, these observed
associations appear to pervade populations and are global in nature, and, although significant advances in
pain management and anxiety control, society-wide estimations of the prevalence of dental care-related
fear/anxiety have remained relatively constant for over half a century.
 Despite the impact of DFA on oral health, the scientific literature is replete with terminology that refers
only to dental fear or only to dental anxiety, yet in the broader psychological literature, fear and anxiety are
known to be separate constructs with unique manifestations. This lack of consistency and interoperability
between the medical and dental care communities in defining and classifying such phenomena has contributed
to the current stalemate in scientific progress as it relates to understanding the etiology and implications of
such phenomena in the dental care context. Without a consensus on the definition, types, scope, and etiology
of DFA, the associated individual, clinical, and population impacts, and viable strategies for intervening to
mitigate or manage such impacts the impact of DFA cannot be adequately studied.
 To address these terminological shortcomings, we have created the Ontology of Dental care-related
Fear, and Anxiety, and/or Phobia (ODFA). By more precisely representing the types of fear and/or anxiety
experienced by individuals, the ODFA’s concepts and relations facilitate the development of tools and
resources capable of enhancing our understanding of the individual, clinical, and population impacts of dental
care-related fear and anxiety. When applied to study data, the ODFA enables the integration and
interoperability of data from multiple studies, which, in turn, provides a means to perform rigorous analysis on
larger datasets in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon and treatments for DFA."

Overview: During interphase, the cohesin complex extrudes chromatin loops to mediate the formation of
chromatin domains and loops, which are elementary 3D structures of the human genome and guide enhancer-
promoter interactions. Disruption to these structures can lead to many diseases including cancer. Our research
has significantly advanced our understanding of how cohesin actively extrude native chromatin loops.
Specifically, we have achieved the following milestones: 1) Established a simple yet very powerful system
enabling mechanistic studies of loop extrusion in near-native nuclei under highly controlled manners. 2)
Uncovered that cohesin engages with chromatin in distinct ways dependent on the stages of loop extrusion. 3)
Discovered distinct biochemical and conformation states of cohesin during loop extrusion.
Goals: Our preliminary results revealed a correlation between cohesin’s biochemical states and its role in
genome folding, and also demonstrated the power of our semi-in vitro systems to study genome folding. We aim
to use this system to capture and analyze distinct states of cohesin during the highly dynamic loop extrusion
process. Our innovative approach also affords us the ability to analyze additional cohesin-dependent activities
such as transcription. We plan to address four major gaps in our understanding of genome folding and its
relevance in cancer. 1) how dose cohesin engage with chromatin? We will use synthetic variants of cohesin
and CTCF to probe the molecular connection between CTCF binding and cohesin-chromatin interactions. 2)
What changes occur in cohesin's composition and conformation during the loop extrusion process? We will
establish a novel analytic framework to systematically explore dynamic changes of cohesin and identify novel
regulators of cohesin. 3) how does cohesin interplay with transcription machinery? We will employ our methods
to analyze cohesin’s states during transcription and probe the interplay between genome folding and
transcription. 4) how do cancer-associated mutations within cohesin affect genome folding and functions.
Cohesin mutations are strongly associated with cancer, but their mechanisms of action remain largely unclear.
We will integrate our analyses with AlphaFold to construct a predictive model and assess the impact of clinically
relevant mutations within cohesin on genome folding and transcription.
Vision: Our innovative methodologies not only enable the functional analysis of cohesin's biochemical states
(subunit composition and conformation such as its ring-like structure) during highly dynamic activities like loop
extrusion and transcription, but also afford a comprehensive understanding of genome folding and regulation,
particularly in the context of cancer."

Novel immune therapies are needed to help the majority of patients with melanoma and other solid tumors who
fail to benefit or stop responding to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and adoptive transfer of tumor specific T
cells is one method that con overcome resistance to other immune therapies. Most research has focused on
engineering CD8 T cells that directly target and kill cancer cells, but this proposal will focus on the “helper”
CD4 T cells that work by orchestrating the function of other immune cells. The goal of this proposal is to
develop a therapeutic strategy using CD4 T cells to overcome treatment resistance in solid tumors.
Correlative studies from patients with cancer show that having greater numbers of tumor specific CD4 T cells
are associated with activation of other immune cells in tumors and better outcomes. Work in mouse cancer
models show that CD4 T cells can work through support of CD8 T cells and through innate immune cell killing
of tumors even when other T cells are not present. The most effective CD4 therapies in the mouse cancer
models have combined CD4 T cells with other signals that activate innate immune cells in tumors, but these
signals are toxic when given throughout the whole body. We have found that two potent innate immune
signals, IL-12 and IL-18 can be engineered into CD4 T cells that can target these signals specifically to tumors.
We find that CD4 T cells engineered in this way can destroy tumors, activate CD8 T cells, and activate immune
cells in mouse cancer models. In our first aim we will identify which molecules made by T cells are important in
this process, which immune cells in tumors are the targets, and which immune cells are responsible for tumor
cell death.
Use of this approach in patients with melanoma will require ways to produce large populations of CD4 T cells
that are specific to the patients’ cancer, and we will obtain these cells from surgically removed tumors from
patients. Existing methods to grow tumor specific T cells from tumors have had some benefit, but the CD4 T
cells are mostly lost during the standard process. We have identified a way to identify the tumor specific CD4 T
cells within a tumor and will use this information to isolate these cells away from other T cells so that we can
grow them. In our second aim we will develop a reliable process to isolate and expand these cells that
maintains their function, as well as engineer them with human versions of the IL-12 and IL-18 signals we
explored in mice. We will then use a humanized mouse model to test whether CD4 T cells grown from human
tumors can effectively target human tumor and immune cells.
The goal of this work is to develop a new type of treatment for cancer using CD4 T cells engineered with innate
immune signals that can be used in clinical trials of patients with treatment resistant melanoma and other solid
tumors."

this, I have integrated novel testing techniques and promising immunotherapy combinations into the design of
NCI-supported clinical trials. I am the overall Principal Investigator for the NRG-GI005 phase II/III trial evaluating
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a predictive biomarker for adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in patients with stage
IIA colon cancer. NRG-GI005 is the first NCI-supported trial for any solid tumor type to incorporate ctDNA as an
integral biomarker for treatment assignment as part of a clinical trial design. Planned analysis of optional blood
collected on this study will compare head-to-head different methodologies for detecting minimal residual disease
(MRD) performed on the same samples and provide missing insights into optimal ctDNA assay selection needed
for future NCI trials evaluating ctDNA as a surrogate for the presence of MRD. I have also written and led, as
overall PI, two immunotherapy trials across NCTN (SWOG S2107) and ETCTN (NCI 9673) sites. Promising
clinical activity for the triple therapy of encorafenib, cetuximab, and nivolumab for patients with microsatellite
stable BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal cancer from a pilot trial at MD Anderson were applied for the
subsequent SWOG S2107 randomized phase II trial, now activated across the NCTN. The ETCTN-sponsored
NCI 9673 trial demonstrated antitumor activity of nivolumab metastatic anal cancer and led to this treatment as
a recommended option on the NCCN Guidelines for anal cancer.
As an R50 funded clinical scientist, I propose to combine these clinical trial leadership experiences and expand
on the role of blood-based biomarkers to generate novel combination immunotherapy trials. I have utilized
extravesicle RNA (evRNA) isolated from plasma to characterize changes in RNA signatures associated with
treatment response to encorafenib, cetuximab, and nivolumab in patients with BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal
cancer. With R50 protected effort, I will expand plasma evRNA analysis in evaluating response using samples
collected from SWOG S2107, with >90% yield from patients enrolled thus far. During the funding period, I also
propose to develop my leadership institutionally in my role as SWOG PI for the NCTN LAPS grant Executive
Committee, where I will expand enrollment at new affiliate sites for MD Anderson, prioritizing SWOG/NCTN trials
first, which we also anticipate will improve underrepresented minority enrollment and address health disparities
on NCI trials conducted under MD Anderson umbrage. If successful, these efforts collectively could serve as
justification to expand the utility of liquid biopsy beyond ctDNA, with the goal of applying translational studies to
identify effective therapeutic strategies for all patients with gastrointestinal malignancies on future NCI-supported
clinical trials."
10942105,"Summary. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer that is treated with
neo-adjuvant therapy that targets both the primary tumor and systemic disease, with subsequent
immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Even with the most cutting-edge therapeutic approach, approximately
20% of these patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) will recur. Our long-term goal is to develop
strategies that target the innate immune system and aim to prevent the establishment of or destabilize sites in
which the tumor cells are protected from destruction by the immune system. Immunotherapies such as CAR-T
cells or immune checkpoint blockade have emerged as promising therapies targeting adaptive immune cells;
however, the efficacy of these treatments remains limited due to the immune protection offered at the
metastatic site by innate cells. We propose a nanoparticle (NP) strategy for targeting monocytes and
neutrophils in circulation, prior to their arrival at a metastatic niche (MN), which we propose can destabilize the
immune suppressive environment that is needed to protect tumor cells from the immune system. The scientific
premise of this application is to investigate the design of NPs to program circulating monocytes and neutrophils
that would normally travel to a MN, with programming indicating the ability to redirect immune cell trafficking
and alter immune cell polarization. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the NP design for polarization of monocytes
and neutrophils that programs an anti-tumor phenotype that leads to tumor cell clearance from metastatic
sites. Properties such as size influence the biodistribution, with the chemical composition influencing cell
interactions and polarization. We propose to initially assess internlization, the biodistribution, safety, and
persistence of NP-associated cells in the MN, the cell types that associate with NPs and the phenotypic
programming, and the impact of NPs on systemic inflammation and tumor cell numbers. We also propose to
analyze the mechanisms of NP function through assessment of i) TC recruitment and persistence in vivo, ii)
immune cell trafficking following adoptive transfer to determine the direct and indirect effects of NPs, and iii)
modulation of neutrophils numbers or phenotypes. Specific Aim 2 will investigate NP design to relieve immune
suppression at the MN and enhance/enable adaptive immune responses. We will investigate the composition
and phenotype of T cells at the MN with and without NP administration in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting.
Additionally, we will investigate the mechanisms by which innate cells direct T cell responses, using studies
such as depletion of T cell subsets, and performing studies to investigate T cell trafficking and persistence at
the MN. The research team includes breast cancer biologist and clinician (Jeruss), an engineer with a
successful history of translating NPs to the clinic (Shea) and am immunologist with expertise in cancer (Yolcu).
NP based targeting of innate immune cells represents a novel strategy for immune modulation that presents
opportunities to replace or complement existing immunotherapies."

This is an application to the Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats (CounterACT) NIH-wide program part
of the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program. Sulfur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and
nitrogen mustard (NM), a chemotherapeutic agent, are both potent vesicants. The cornea is exquisitely sensitive
to these agents leading to keratitis, vascularization, ulceration, and perforations. Following acute SM exposure,
a subset of patients will experience chronic/delayed-onset ocular complications known as mustard gas
keratopathy (MGK). Delayed MGK reportedly can manifest several years after the initial exposure and presents
with severe corneal disease with significant visual loss. We have made the observation that in experimental
animal models of NM injury to the cornea, there is dose-dependent increased senescence in the cornea. We
hypothesize that senescence in the cornea promotes tissue dysfunction and inflammationand that senescence
after mustard injury contributes to the progression of chronic MGK and the severity of delayed MGK. We
further hypothesize that reducing/eliminating senescent cells may alter the progression and severity of MGK. In
this application we propose in Aim1 to investigate the role of senescence and SASP in the progression of
corneal disease following acute exposure to NM; and in Aim 2 to investigate the role of senescence in a new
model of delayed MGK. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to have an improved understanding of the
role of senescence in the development of MGK and identify novel approaches for its prevention/treatment."

Core B: CMS Data Core
The CMS Data Core acquires, manages, enhances, and makes available for researcher use a rich collection of
claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The NBER’s existing CMS database
consists of Medicare claims for all beneficiaries covered by traditional fee-for-service Medicare over the last 35
years. Incremental goals of this continuation are to add Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicaid records, and to
enhance the data to better support studies of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and racial
and ethnic disparities in health and healthcare. Working with Core C, we will incorporate in our CMS databases
state-of-the-art measures of ADRD symptoms and diagnosis, stages of dementia, and cognitive impairment;
state-of-the-art identifiers for patient and to some extent provider race and ethnicity; and likely spousal
identification as potential caregivers. There are substantial interactions between Cores B and C, as the
methodological implementation of existing algorithms and advances in ADRD and race/ethnicity measurement
developed under Core C will be incorporated in our CMS database infrastructure under Core B. To accomplish
these aims, we will draw on our extensive experience working with the underlying claims records, newly informed
by additional Program Project collaborators with relevant expertise in ADRD patient care, ADRD and dementia-
related measurement, and racial disparities research. The core also administers all CMS data security systems
and assures that all resources developed from this grant and other NIA-supported research at the NBER are
hosted or linkable from the NBER public use data archive. These NBER’s CMS data infrastructure will be used
extensively in the research projects proposed here and in roughly 200 other projects that we expect CMS will
authorize to reuse the NBER database over the next five years."
10942627,"Project Summary/Abstract
The nematode C. elegans is a leading experimental and genetic model for aging, and both public and private
institutions have made enormous investments in aging research in this system. Several lines of evidence
show that the intestine is the major tissue affecting healthy lifespan in C. elegans. The intestine is likely to be a
sensitive and early indicator of age-dependent cellular stress, as the intestine lacks an apoptosis pathway or
stem cell population to remove or replace damaged cells. Intestinal nuclei have been shown to undergo
progressive deterioration during aging, including the loss of entire nuclei. Old, abnormal intestinal nuclei show
a loss of peripheral heterochromatin, a disruption of chromosomal organization, and the accumulation of
intranuclear bodies that contain the protein lamin. Recent studies showed that some intestinal nuclei show
abnormalities as early as the first two days of adulthood, and that these early abnormalities include the
formation of lamin-containing nuclear bodies and the loss of peripheral heterochromatin. Because these
defects occur early in development, they are likely to represent critical events that drive nuclear deterioration
during aging, rather than indirect consequences of age-compromised cells. Some of the intranuclear lamin
and loss of peripheral heterochromatin is associated with fat accumulation in the nucleus, called nuclear lipid
droplets or nLDs. Recent studies have shown that diverse liver diseases in humans are associated with
increased numbers of nLDs, and nLDs in C. elegans have been shown to increase during aging. nLDs in other
systems show a complex relationship with fat, and nLDs in the C. elegans intestine appear to be correlated
with changes in lipid storage that occur during reproductive development. This proposal investigates the origin
of intranuclear lamin in intestinal cells, its relationship to nLDs, and the role of lipid storage. The research uses
C. elegans tools for forward and reverse genetics to identify pathways that cause, or act to remove, the
intranuclear lamin. The project analyzes specific roles for two genes which are involved in nLD formation and
that are conserved in humans. The long-term goal of the project is to develop strategies that modulate these
pathways to intervene in age-associated tissue deterioration."
10943430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of healthy molar teeth with elongated roots, mineralized dentin, and sensory innervation re-
quires coordinated efforts between neuronal and mesenchymal tissue. During the first week of development,
mouse molars begin all three developmental processes of secreting a dentin matrix, initiating root elongation,
and secreting chemoattractants to guide sensory afferent penetration into the pulp tissue. Research has shown
that disrupting pulp mesenchyme signals during this period can have drastic effects on one or more of these
processes. These coordinated processes are conserved in humans and pose clinical challenges for pediatric
dentists and endodontists attempting to ensure the long-term vitality of an infected or damaged immature tooth.
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cellular mechanisms that protect teeth via dental tissue
crosstalk. The objective is to determine the mechanisms that regulate the development of a tooth into a miner-
alized, anchored, sensory organ. Our central hypothesis is that Sema7a signaling from differentiating odonto-
blasts regulates tooth mineralization, root elongation, and innervation. This hypothesis was formulated because
our mouse model of conditional Tgfbr2 deletion in tooth mesenchyme demonstrated reduced mineralization,
root elongation, and innervation coinciding with reduced Sema7a RNA expression in the DP and aberrant lo-
calization of SEMA7a in the apical regions of the developing teeth. Guided by our previously generated data,
we will test our hypothesis with the following two specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of global and condi-
tional deletion in dental pulp mesenchyme of Sema7a on dentin mineralization, root elongation, and tooth in-
nervation; and 2) Isolate the role(s) of SEMA7a signaling to DP neuronal and mesenchymal populations with in
vitro assays. Under the first aim, we will analyze tooth morphology, including the dentin volume, density, and
thickness, root length, and tooth innervation using the Sema7a-/- mouse model in addition to a conditional
knockout mouse with Sema7a deletion induced by the osterix-promoter driven Cre recombinase induced at
postnatal day 3. For the second aim, we will utilize a co-culture model with primary dental pulp cells and tri-
geminal neurons to assess whether SEMA7a regulates the processes of odontoblast differentiation, matrix
deposition and neurite outgrowth. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it a) investi-
gates a previously unrecognized chemoattractant involved in the process of tooth development during the criti-
cal window of time during the initiation of matrix deposition, root elongation, and tooth innervation; and b) pro-
poses to be the first study to examine tooth development in models with global and conditional deletion of
Sema7a. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the understanding of how
these three developmental processes are regulated during a critical window of time during postnatal tooth de-
velopment. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to bolster regenerative endodontics to treat injuries
and disease states, and to ensure the proper development and long-term retention of healthy teeth."
10943154,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major public health problem that is commonly seen in primary care clinics
where a majority of outpatient office visits occur. Prior studies suggest that OSA is severely under-diagnosed in
primary care practices, but these studies relied on patient reported symptoms rather than objective diagnosis.
Consequently, the prevalence of OSA and rate of under-diagnosis of OSA among primary care practices are
not currently known. Given the recent studies implicating the excessively sleepy OSA symptom subtype to the
development of cardiovascular events, it is also important to ascertain the prevalence and underdiagnosis rate
of this OSA subtype among patients seen at primary care clinics. In addition to estimating prevalence, it is
equally important to evaluate the factors contributing to the likelihood of underdiagnosis across different
primary care practices. Barriers to OSA diagnosis include patient factors related to lack of awareness and
understanding of the disease, physician perceptions of OSA risk and knowledge about the heterogeneous
presentation of OSA, and system and practice-specific factors such as time constraints. The growth of
electronic health records (EHRs) in recent years also provides the unique ability to identify these undiagnosed
and untreated cases via the application of automated algorithms. Our preliminary data suggest that combining
readily available data in EHRs including comorbidities using machine learning techniques offers an opportunity
to develop a reliable OSA phenotypic risk score that would facilitate OSA case identification in primary care.
New paradigms for identification of OSA and its subtypes centered on primary care and using data from the
EHR, including comorbidities and patient symptoms, are needed to meet the high prevalence of OSA. In Aim 1,
using a two-stage sampling strategy in primary care practices, we will determine the prevalence of OSA and its
subtypes, and robustly estimate the rate of OSA under-diagnosis in primary care clinics. In Aim 2, we intend to
develop a root cause analysis of the underdiagnosis of OSA problem in primary care practice setting using a
systems engineering framework. We will elicit the barriers and facilitators of the OSA diagnostic process within
the work system of the primary care practice setting using stakeholder engagement methods with multi-level
stakeholders. Using these results, we will survey primary care providers and staff to estimate the frequency
and priority rank-order of OSA diagnostic process barriers and facilitators within the primary care work system.
In Aim 3, using a novel machine learning pipeline, we will develop an efficient and accurate tool for determining
OSA risk in primary care participants recruited in Aim 1 and an efficient tool to determine OSA subtype that
could be employed within the context of primary care practice. This proposal will ultimately lead to increased
identification of OSA and its subtypes in primary care clinics and prioritize treatment of patients that will most
benefit from therapy which may reduce the burden of significant health problems that are associated with this
very common condition."
10939741,"The term ""prion"" was originally coined to describe the agent responsible for neurodegenerative diseases
associated with the prion protein, PrP. This concept has now broadened to encompass a wide range of proteins
in various organisms, linked to crucial cellular functions or diseases. For example, human pathogenic proteins
like Aβ, tau, α-synuclein and p53 in cancer and neurodegeneration have been proposed to follow prion-like
mechanisms. However, the precise role of prions in these proteinopathies remains unclear. Yeast is a valuable
platform for prion research, with several prion proteins acting as transcription modulators. One notable example
is [SWI+], the prion form of Swi1, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF. Despite clear
evidence of [SWI+] significantly impacting transcription, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Moreover,
whether Swi1 orthologs or other components of the human SWI/SNF (also termed BAF) complexes can undergo
prion-like conformational changes has yet to be investigated. Understanding this is vital because SWI/SNF
complexes play a crucial role in transcription regulation, and BAF mutations are implicated in over 20% of tumor
cases and numerous neurological diseases. The long-term goal of our research is to uncover the link between
prions and BAF complexes and contribute to novel therapeutic strategies for related diseases. Specifically, this
project aims to determine if [SWI+] exists in ""variants"" that produce distinct transcriptomic and phenotypic effects.
Additionally, we aim to understand how [SWI+] alters the structure and activities of SWI/SNF, and induces
abnormal protein interactions and heterotypic protein aggregation, ultimately leading to transcriptomic and
phenotypic changes. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether any BAF proteins or their mutants exhibit prion-
like behaviors. Our studies have far-reaching implications for other prion-based models and are highly relevant
to human health. To achieve our research goals, we will employ a range of techniques. For Aim 1, we will use
classical genetic and biochemical manipulations, RNA-seq, and functional assays to characterize [SWI+] variants.
For Aim 2, we will utilize immunopurification, quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), ATPase assays, ChIP-seq,
and reChIP-seq to examine the impact of [SWI+] on SWI/SNF architecture and functions. Meanwhile, we will
employ differential centrifugation combined with MS to identify the [SWI+] aggregome and perform genetic and
cellular assays to investigate the interaction mechanism among the aggregomic components. For Aim 3, we will
examine prion-like domains (PrLDs) of BAF proteins for fibrillization in vitro and prionogenicity in yeast. We will
also develop human cell lines with EGFP-based prion reporters to screen for prions of full-length BAF proteins
and their mutants and investigate whether their prion conversion can be promoted by the generated in vitro fibrils
and yeast prion lysates originating from PrLDs. In summary, the outcome of this project will not only underscore
the link of the prion phenomenon with SWI/SNF (BAF) complexes but also will advance our understanding of
prion-mediated cellular activities and diseases in general."
10928371,"Objective. There is no universal measure of tinnitus apart from subjective reports. Therefore, to
improve Veteran health and wellbeing, it is crucial that objective tools be developed that distinguish
between the presence of tinnitus and tinnitus distress. Tinnitus distress is a high impact area of study in
Veterans because tinnitus is consistently the most-common service-connected disability. The Cognitive
Behavioral Model of Tinnitus Distress predicts that one of the proposed mechanisms behind tinnitus
distress is that it increases the cognitive demands on the listener, which interfere with their ability to
concentrate. The application of cognitive resources towards a listening task is commonly referred to as
listening effort. Increased listening effort increases sympathetic nervous system activity, and
pupillometry can reliably capture these changes. The Cognitive Behavioral Model of Tinnitus Distress
asserts that bothersome tinnitus increases arousal and distress, which also increase sympathetic
nervous system activity. Skin conductance measurements reliably increase when participants view or
listen to arousing images and sounds; they also covary with pupil responses. Therefore, this proposal
will use pupillometry and skin conductance to explore how distressing tinnitus alters listening effort and
affective processing.
Design. The proposed study will employ a cross-sectional design and quantify sympathetic nervous
system activity that has been associated with listening effort and affective processing. Adult Veterans
and non-Veterans will be recruited and grouped into one of three categories: 1) adult controls without
hearing loss or distressing tinnitus, 2) adults with hearing loss but not distressing tinnitus, 3) adults with
hearing loss and distressing tinnitus.
Methods. Participants will listen to sentences, view affective images, and listen to affective sounds.
Pupillometry and skin conductance responses will be simultaneously recorded for all stimuli. These
methods will be used to address the following aims:
Aim 1: Quantify the “selective monitoring and attention” component of the Cognitive-Behavioral
Model of Tinnitus Distress by assessing listening effort in Veterans with and without distressing
tinnitus. The working hypothesis is that distressing tinnitus is associated with increased listening effort.
Participants with tinnitus distress will exhibit larger pupil dilations while listening to sentences,
particularly in quiet, compared to adults without tinnitus distress. Skin conductance responses are not
anticipated to be sensitive to listening effort.
Aim 2: Quantify the “arousal and distress” component of the Cognitive-Behavioral Model of
Tinnitus Distress by assessing physiological responses to affective visual and auditory stimuli
in Veterans with and without distressing tinnitus. The working hypothesis is that distressing tinnitus
is associated with amplified physiological responses to affective auditory and visual stimuli. Participants
with tinnitus distress will exhibit larger pupil dilations and covarying skin conductance responses to
affective stimuli compared to adults without tinnitus distress.
The rationale for these aims is that they will lead to the development of high impact tools that will allow
future research to 1) objectively measure therapeutics designed to reduce tinnitus distress and 2)
examine how different comorbidities such as blast exposure, TBI, and PTSD affect tinnitus distress."
10928394,"Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) remains the topmost killer among infectious diseases globally, and is one of the world’s most
significant medical challenges. Approximately one quarter of the world population has been infected with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the majority being latent cases that could give rise to active disease. Ten
million incident cases associated with 1.4 million deaths were reported in 2019. In the last 90+ years, Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, has been the only available vaccine
against TB. The vaccine has been effective in preventing life-threatening extra-pulmonary TB in children, but has
variable efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB in adults, and is associated with side effects. With escalating
population movement around the globe, the need for improved TB vaccines that can prevent infection has
become critical. Yet, despite significant interest, vaccine development has been limited by insufficient funding,
as well as a lack of clear understanding of the nature of both innate and acquired immunity in the lung, and their
role in the protective immune response against M.tb. In order to address the need for improved versions of BCG
that provide better efficacy and safety compared to traditional BCG, OncoSTING is developing OS-101 and OS-
151, recombinant versions of BCG engineered to overexpress the potent STING agonist c-di-AMP for a two-
pronged mechanism of action: (i) induction of anti-TB immunity by the same mechanisms known to be elicited
by traditional BCG (BCG-WT ) and (ii) stimulation of the STING pathway leading to upregulation of a several pro-
inflammatory responses and enhanced “Trained Immunity” (TI) in macrophages. OncoSTING is the only
company developing STING agonist delivery by a live bacterial vaccine—BCG. As supported by preliminary
data, these improved versions of BCG offer potential both for greater protective efficacy that lasts into adulthood,
and an improved safety profile. A significant database has been compiled for OS-101, which is resistant to the
antibiotic kanamycin. However, the FDA does not allow advanced human clinical trials with BCG strains
harboring antibiotic resistance. OncoSTING has therefore generated OS-151, an antibiotic resistance-free
version of OS-101. In Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal bridging mouse immunogenicity and efficacy studies
will be conducted to support the use of data generated with the OS-101 strain in regulatory filings for OS-151. In
Phase II, OS-151 drug product formulation and manufacturing approach will be established, and pivotal GLP
toxicology studies will be conducted to position for an IND application and clinical trial initiation. A toxicology
study in guinea pig to characterize post vaccination toxicity and identify potential for vaccination site inflammatory
response, systemic toxicity, and long-term persistence of any adverse findings will establish that OS-151 is safe
to initiate a clinical trial. The results from this proposal will position OncoSTING to submit an IND and conduct a
U.S. Phase 1 first time in human trial (FTIH); with the ultimate goal of demonstrating superiority of OS-151 versus
BCG as a vaccine against TB."
10928490,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In the United States, diabetes (DM) impacts 37.3 million people (11.3% population) and 96 million people aged 18
years or older have prediabetes (38.0% of the adult US population). One in three of DM will develop diabetic
retinopathy (DR) in their lifetime, which is the leading cause of blindness in adults leading to permanent disability.
Ethnic minority groups are at greater risk for vision-threatening disease and disability from diabetes. Vision loss
can be the result of progression to proliferative DR (PDR) or from diabetic macular edema (DME). An eye exam
can detect these conditions and may include the technology of optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus
photography (FP), and/or fluorescein angiography (FA). OCT measures central macular thickness (CMT) to detect
DME and can be used to guide treatment decisions, while FP and FA improve PDR detection. Subjects in many
DR clinical trials are disproportionately White and male compared to the population undergoing DR treatment.
Early evidence suggests that minoritized men with greater CMT are at risk for vision loss if left untreated. Given
that DM and DR are more prevalent in minorities and that 90% of DM-related vision loss is preventable, immediate
effort is needed to address this disparity and evaluate predictive capabilities of DR stage, CMT, clinical measures
(hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, etc.), and social determinants of health (SDH) to improve screening and
treatment guidelines for high-risk groups. The proposed study, Health Equity and Access to Leverage Technology
for Improved DR Outcomes (HEAL-DR) fulfills a large gap in the current NIH ocular health disparities portfolio with
modelling (OCT machine data) to better identify minority people at greatest risk for both undetected and high-risk
disease using the Sight OUtcomes Research CollaborativE (SOURCE). SOURCE links electronic health record
data from 35 large academic medical centers to capture visual exam data and details typically found in clinical
trials. SOURCE overcomes major data barriers in ophthalmology health disparities work because it contains
robust, granular eye exam data for assessing treatment, quality, and outcomes, combined with key information on
race and ethnicity, gender, SDH measures, medications, HbA1c, Centers for Disease Control National Death
Index Data and others. Outputs from this research will enhance visual risk assessment with new modelling to
better identify minority people at greatest risk for vision loss from undetected and/or worsening disease (early
PDR, occult DME) on a population level. This study fulfills the target goals for National Eye Institute and Healthy
People 2030 and will lead to enhanced clinical guidelines for targeted outreach to those at greatest risk of DM
related visual impairment. This study: 1) is innovative, 2) is stakeholder-driven by both the American Medical
Association (AMA), Center for Health Equity and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), Task
Force on Eye Care Disparities), 3) uses SOURCE data from multiple states and regions to analyze and reduce
health care disparities in DR. The project is aligned with the missions of the NIH, AMA, AAO, and the National
Academy of Medicine (NAM) on reducing health disparities and the prevention of vision loss."
10928970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain is a ubiquitous problem and growing concern for the Military Health System (MHS). Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain are the most common chronic pain conditions in the MHS. Numerous recommendations have been made to improve care for chronic MSK pain in the MHS. Important recommendations informing this project include; 1) the Office of the Army Surgeon General is promoting transition of the MHS to a holistic health system that seeks to maintain, restore and improve health through team-based care supporting self-management and recognizing the complex, biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain; and 2) a stepped care approach to pain management is advocated to make less intense, but effective, first-line care broadly available and basing subsequent care on response to first-line options. While the MHS has articulated its vision for holistic pain care delivered within a stepped care framework, there is a need for research addressing key questions about which interventions are most effective and how to operationalize the stepped care model. In addition, pragmatic, sustainable, strategies to implement holistic pain care in the MHS are needed. Electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly used to implement evidence-based interventions, but have not been widely tested in the MHS. The MHS has deployed a new system-wide EHR with standards-based capabilities for
decision-support, making EHR-based implementation a timely option with high potential for Future scalability.
Our goal in this project is to improve pain care in the MHS by identifying effective, whole-person, nonpharmacologic interventions for persons with chronic MSK pain. We will evaluate two promising, evidence-based interventions; Empowered Relief (ER) and Move-to-Health (M2H). We will compare these interventions to one another and to usual care (UC). We will also test a stepped care strategy of providing ER first, followed by M2H for non-responders. The current environment and policy priorities in the Department of Defense and MHS makes this the ideal time to evaluate holistic pain interventions and test strategies for stepped care delivery.
Our project has two Phases: 1) a UG3 Planning Phase, and 2) a UH3 Clinical Trial Phase. In the UG3 phase the plans for implementation across MHS sites will be completed and all necessary preparations will be made for the clinical trial. In the UH3 phase we will conduct a hybrid type-I, individually-randomized pragmatic clinical trial comparing M2H vs. ER vs. UC as first-line pain interventions, and examining a stepped care strategy of providing ER first, followed by M2H for non-responders. We will use EHR-based strategies to connect patients with chronic MSK pain in primary care clinics with the holistic pain management strategies. The primary outcome will be the PEG measure of pain impact. Secondary outcomes will include additional effectiveness measures as well as implementation outcomes grounded in a RE-AIM framework."

Synapses are the basis of neuronal communication and plasticity. Decades of research in reduced preparations
have revealed fundamental principles of neuronal transmission and synaptic plasticity. This work identified key
molecular constituents of synapses and pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying activity dependent
changes in synaptic transmission. Now, technological advances in optical manipulation and read-out
technologies have opened the door to studying the role of synapses in-vivo. Thus, allowing dissection of synapse
function from neuronal circuits to cognition.
Synaptic plasticity is integral to development and experience-dependent changes in the brain. While there have
been attempts to link synaptic plasticity mechanisms discovered in reduced preparations to in-vivo function such
as memory formation, important challenges and questions remain. How do the longer time scales of behavioral
memory formation and the corresponding in-vivo synaptic changes relate to the relatively short time scales of
synaptic transmission and plasticity? What role does synaptic plasticity play in the formation and updating of
large-scale neural networks (internal models) underlying cognitive processes involving prospective planning and
inference? How is information maintained in neural circuits in the face of dynamic and changing synaptic
architecture in the developing and adult brain? How do non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes and microglia
contribute to synaptic function and plasticity? When and how can our understanding of basic mechanisms of
synaptic function be used to develop treatments for debilitating psychiatric disorders?
Coming out of the global coronavirus pandemic this meeting is particularly relevant as the usual lines of
international scientific communication and collaboration were cut and research endeavors became isolated.
Trainees and junior faculty were particularly hard hit during this time as their ability to network and collaborate
across borders was severely curtailed. In-person, face-to-face scientific interaction and discussion is needed
now more than ever. Our meeting will bring together scientists from the US and Japan at many stages of career
development to re-energize global scientific exchange between our two countries. Our goals are to share in
recent scientific successes and, most importantly, identify new directions for the field which will spark innovation
and collaboration."
10930360,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 As part of NHLBI’s ENRICH program, this research will test an implementation-ready intervention designed
to improve cardiovascular health (CVH) among high risk mothers and young children during pregnancy and the
first two years after delivery. Home visitation (HV) models meeting federal criteria of evidence of effectiveness
will be leveraged to compare existing HV programs against those with an additional CVH intervention in a
cluster-randomized, multicenter trial.
 Our multidisciplinary team has pioneered behavioral and lifestyle interventions for women during
preconception and pregnancy and for infants during the first years after birth including those using HV for the
primary prevention of obesity. We also have extensive research experience linking and integrating community-
based healthcare programs with health system electronic medical records (EMRs). For this proposal, we will
collaborate with two Nurse-Family Partnership agencies in Northern Appalachia, a medically underserved
region with high rates of poverty and poor CVH, including high rates of obesity, heart disease, and tobacco
use. We will enroll ≥500 of the 3000 pregnant women required for the UH3 phase multicenter trial.
 During the UG3 phase, we will pilot our proposed intervention with our community partners and work
collaboratively with other ENRICH sites and NHLBI to develop the UH3 phase common protocol. Our proposed
intervention incorporates tenets of Social Cognitive Theory and the Framework for Understanding Poverty
using a skill-building curriculum that includes role modeling, goal-setting, and skill practice opportunities in the
home. Five intervention pillars (Lifestyle Behaviors, Self-Regulation, Responsive Parenting, Home
Environment, EMR Integration) are designed to increase maternal knowledge and self-efficacy in their ability to
establish healthy lifestyle habits and maternal parenting practices to improve CVH. Consistent with a Hybrid
Trial Type 1, the study design aims to understand the context for implementing the intervention. The composite
primary outcome for mothers will be a modified version of the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 one
year after childbirth; outcomes will also be assessed 2 years postpartum. The childhood primary outcome will
be a composite of seven early life risk factors for poor CVH across with the final assessment at age 2 years.
For these outcomes, the moderating effects of social determinants of health and psychosocial indices on
outcomes will be explored. In addition, the context for implementation will be evaluated and factors influencing
intervention efficacy will be identified to determine in HV, what works best, for whom, in which contexts, why
and how. Lastly, we aim to lead network efforts to link and integrate HV summaries into EMRs to allow for data
sharing with healthcare providers to enhance intervention effectiveness so that the UH3 protocol can evaluate
whether EMR integration with HV programs improves CVH composite indicators as well as health equity."

Dilation & curettage (D&C) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on women throughout
the world. Intrauterine adhesions (iUA), or Asherman, develop in about 40% of women who undergo D&C in
the postpartum (6 week period after birth), but is very rare after D&C in nonpregnant women (<1%) for reasons
that are not well understood. It is a debilitating condition characterized by intrauterine fibrosis and scarring.
Patients with iUA suffer from infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss and a broad range of dangerous pregnancy
complications (e.g. preterm birth). While endometrial mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (eMPCs) and
macrophage immune cell populations are crucial for endometrial repair and postpartum uterine remodeling, the
role of these cells and underlying molecular mechanisms in this postpartum susceptibility of the endometrium
to fibrosis and abnormal repair are unknown. This application is specifically focused on defining the role that
macrophages play in abnormal uterine repair, given the known important role of macrophage activation as a
driver of fibrosis in other organs. The central hypothesis is that macrophages in the postpartum uterus are
polarized to M2 phenotype, resulting in a profibrotic response to uterine injury as compared to M1
macrophages of the nonpregnant uterus, ultimately leading to fibrosis and scar formation. The approach is to
use our novel postpartum mouse uterine injury model which recapitulates the susceptibility of the human
postpartum uterus to injury. Using this model, we will characterize the macrophage populations and
polarization dynamics in the postpartum and nonpregnant uterus in response to injury (Aim 1). We will directly
examine the role of macrophage polarization in inducing profibrotic transformation of endometrial stromal
fibroblasts using in vitro co-cultures (Aim 2) to gain detailed insights into the cellular and molecular differences
that predispose the postpartum endometrium to form iUA. The proposed aims are conceptually innovative and
together will have a broad impact on the field by filling a substantial gap in our fundamental knowledge of
endometrial biology and infertility pathogenesis. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this proposal will not
only be invaluable to our understanding of many more subtle conditions of abnormal endometrial repair, but
provide unique insights into the body’s physiological anti-fibrotic wound healing mechanisms leading to a
deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of fatal idiopathic fibrotic diseases in other organs."

The UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute is a research partnership of the University of California
Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and the
Harbor- UCLA Medical Center/ Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Our mission is to bring biomedical
innovations to bear on the greatest health needs of Los Angeles, an ethnically and economically diverse
metropolis of more than 10 million people. In the past 10 years, we have built a robust research infrastructure
to support our mission. In partnership with the community, we have made important advances against the
leading causes of preventable disability and death. Supporting these advances is a streamlined regulatory
infrastructure. We have instituted scientific review, reduced time-to-study-activation by 42%, and achieved
100% compliance with ClinicalTrials.Gov. As we enter our next decade, we are building on our progress by
augmenting the integration with our institutional hub partners and broadening collaborations in the community
as well as with investigators outside the health professions. Because Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is a
foundational principle of our CTSI, we have embarked on an Inclusive Science Initiative, led by our EDI Senior
Associate Director, to ensure that our research and training programs continue to embrace this guiding
principle. Through new T1-T4 seminars and team science trainings and opportunities, we are equipping our
trainees to conduct multidisciplinary team science across the translational spectrum. We are systematically
evaluating our CTSI outcomes and overall impact. The UCLA CTSI has five specific aims: 1) Enhance
education and training to prepare and expand the translational workforce, 2) Engage stakeholder
communities in multidisciplinary team science and disseminate successful models of collaboration, 3)
Integrate special populations, including those experiencing health disparities, into translational
research, 4) Improve methods and processes to accelerate efficient, high-quality, multisite research,
and 5) Provide informatics solutions to advance high-impact translational science."
10930621,"PROJECT SUMMARY - FROM PARENT AWARD
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Though the risk of mortality from
stroke has declined with advances in reperfusion therapies, the number of survivors developing long-term
cognitive impairment has increased with patients experiencing deficits across multiple cognitive domains
including short-term memory, executive function and language. While significant research efforts have focused
on neuroprotective strategies to reduce infarct volume following ischemic insult, numerous clinical trials showed
no improvements functional outcome, despite effective reduction in infarct volume. For this proposal, I consider
potential molecular targets for neurorestorative strategies, which aim to restore neural networks perturbed by
ischemic injury. I specifically investigate molecular targets which improve Schaffer-CA1 hippocampal long-term
potentiation (LTP), one of the mechanisms thought to underlie learning and memory, at both acute and delayed
timepoints following stroke. By targeting hippocampal pathways, we aim to reduce the burden of cognitive
deficits experienced by numerous patients following ischemic stroke.
The transient receptor potential melastatin-related 2 channel (TRPM2) ion channel serves as a promising
candidate for pharmacologic intervention post-stroke. TRPM2 is a nonselective cation channel, well-studied due
to its sensitivity to oxidative stress and its implication in various central nervous system pathologies. Here, we
demonstrate TRPM2 global knockout or pharmacologic inhibition restores hippocampal LTP and hippocampal-
dependent learning and memory in a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). However, the
cell-type specific role of TRPM2 and its mechanism of activation remain largely unknown. In this proposal, I
examine the neuronal contribution of TRPM2 to hippocampal synaptic and cognitive impairment in a mouse
model of MCAO. I also provide compelling preliminary evidence the ectoenzyme, CD38, is upregulated in
astrocytes following MCAO, generating ligand necessary for TRPM2 activation, thereby producing cognitive
deficits in both sexes. To further elucidate the cell-specific role of TRPM2 and its mechanism of activation, I
propose to employ in vitro and in vivo electrophysiologic, molecular and neurobehavioral approaches. In this
proposal, I investigate a novel neuroglial mechanism to uncover potential molecular targets for acute and chronic
pharmacologic intervention to reduce the burden of cognitive disability following ischemic stroke."
10935868,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE 1
The liver is of central importance to whole-body metabolism, with major roles, among others, in glucose and fatty
acid metabolism, and cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. Excess nutrition leads to the development of aberrant
fat deposition, which contributes to metabolic stress and the potential for progression of liver disease to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Study of metabolism is therefore of great relevance for understanding the
development of HCC and is a central theme within this P01 application. Core 1 will support the metabolic
research in Projects within this program both by providing an analytical service and by provision of expert advice
on the design of experiments and interpretation of results. Core 1 will quantify metabolites and measure the
stable isotope content (labeling) of metabolites in cells and tissues, and will use the labeling data to calculate
metabolic flux. Areas of metabolism of specific interest are glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, TCA
cycle, fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol, oxy-sterol, bile acid and hexosamine metabolism. These assays will be
implemented for in vitro cell and tissue slice cultures, and in vivo, with analysis of liver, tumor, and plasma
specimens. Through these studies, we aim to contribute to knowledge of the metabolic landscape of HCC, and
how by differing from normal metabolism it might offer avenues for therapeutic intervention leading to improved
HCC treatment."
10935611,"Project Summary/Abstract (Core A: Administrative Core)
The Administrative Core will facilitate coordination among all other cores and supported grants. The purpose
of this center is to provide services that were part of our P50 center from 2014 to 2024. That center led to the
development of numerous interacting projects and grants that we will continue to support. Dr. Palmer will serve
as the Center Director; consistent with PAR-23-049 he will also serve as the PI of the Administrative Core. He
will be assisted by Dr. Oksana Polesskaya, who has served as the Scientific Coordinator for the P50 since
January 2015; she will continue to serve in a similar role in the proposed P30 center. We have identified seven
Specific Aims for the Administrative Core:
Specific Aim 1. Promote interactions among users of heterogeneous stock (HS) rats.
Specific Aim 2. Maintain the center’s website (www(dot)ratgenes(dot)org).
Specific Aim 3. Maintain the Center’s Database and Support the Center’s Data Management Plan,
Specific Aim 4. Maintain an External Advisory Board (EAB),
Specific Aim 5. Promote education of junior scientists and outreach to the public and implement our Plan for
Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP)
Specific Aim 6. Resolve conflicts and maintain succession planning, and
Specific Aim 7. Provide financial and administrative support.
This core will coordinate the activities of the other three cores. Core B will maintain the HS rat colony, and will
expand its scope to also distribute RATTACA rats, which are HS rats with genetically predicted phenotypes.
Core C will provide genotyping of HS rats, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping and other genetic analyses. Core D will fund Pilot Projects to promote
the use of the services offered by this center and to continue to support the ecosystem that has developed
over the past decade."
10935612,"Project Summary/Abstract (Core B: HS Breeding Core)
 The heterogeneous stock (HS) Breeding Core (PI: Dr. Leah Solberg Woods) will maintain an HS rat
colony at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM), and a satellite colony at the University of
California San Diego (UCSD). These colonies will produce and distribute HS rats at a subsidized price to
encourage their widespread use. HS rats were created in 1984 by interbreeding eight inbred rat strains. Since
their creation, HS rats have been maintained as an outbred population for almost 100 generations.
Recombinations have accumulated over those generations, which break the founder chromosomes into small
haplotypes, which is essential for fine-mapping of genetic loci. Dr. Solberg Woods has maintained the HS rat
colony since 2006; the colonies at WFUSM and UCSD are the only HS rat colonies in the world. Over the
last decade, the HS rat Breeding Core supported by our P50 center became a heavily used national
resource. That core sent out more than 16,000 rats to more than 25 universities in the US and to Italy,
Germany and Spain. This core will support numerous funded and submitted grants.
 In addition to providing HS rats, this core also supports a new and innovative paradigm called
RATTACA (RAT Trait Ascertainment using Common Alleles) that uses data collected over the last decade to
predict the phenotypes of newborn HS rats based on their genotype. As we describe, RATTACA can be used
to predict any of the phenotypes that have been the subject of prior genome wide association studies (GWAS)
in HS rats. This allows this core to provide rats that are likely to display extreme phenotypes, somewhat
analogous to what has previously been available using genetically selected lines. RATTACA will allow us to
expand the center’s impact by supporting scientists who are not geneticists. RATTACA prediction works best
when a few rats can be genetically selected from a larger population, making it a perfect complement to an HS
Breeding Core that produces large numbers of HS rats.
 RATTACA rats can be used for unique study designs. For example, we can identify rats that would
show strong susceptibility or resilience to cocaine addiction-like behaviors. Normally, such rats would be
identified based on their observed phenotype. However, differences between such groups might then be due to
the different levels of cocaine exposure in the high and low groups, or to the genetic predisposition that led
them to self-administer different amounts of cocaine. Using RATTACA, cocaine naive groups that are
genetically susceptible or resilient to cocaine addiction-like behavior can be compared; observed differences
must be due to this genetic predisposition. Thus, RATTACA is an innovative experimental paradigm that will be
offered as subsidized service by this core, thus broadening the impact of our center."
10935614,"Project Summary (Core D: Pilot Project Core)
 The purpose of the Pilot Project Core is to fund pilot projects that are likely to produce new
collaborations, publications, and grants. We will consider the project and the applicant and will seek to fund all
career stages, genders, under-represented minorities, people with disabilities and people from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Pilot projects will not be used to supplement or prolong ongoing research, nor will they serve as
bridge funds for the maintenance of ongoing research.
 While this P30 application is a new grant, we hope to build on our experience from our previously
funded P50 center, which also had a pilot project core. The Pilot Project Core will offer 1- and 2-year grants
that will include money (up to $25,000 per year), heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, RATTACA rats (RAT Trait
Ascertainment using Common Alleles), which are HS rats selected based on genetically predicted phenotypes
as described in Core B, genotyping or analysis services or any combination thereof. We anticipate various
types of grants, for example: 1) projects to follow-up on studies that target specific genes identified by
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), for example by using mutant rats, viral vectors, or pharmacological
agents, 2) projects to collect preliminary phenotype data using HS rats, 3) project that develop new statistical,
bioinformatic or machine learning methodologies that can be used to better analyze data that have already
been generated by our center, 4) projects that use the genotyping or analysis services provided by Core C,
and 5) we will also consider awards that use complementary approaches provided that they are related to the
center’s work. For example, our P50 funded a project that examined genes identified in HS rats using a mutant
c. elegans screen. In all cases, the goal of these grants will be to strategically enhance the impact of the center
and to engage the broader scientific community. Grants will allow initiation of activities that, if successful, will
become self-sustaining.
 We describe how pilot project applications will be solicited, evaluated, and how we will use those
evaluations, in conjunction with other programmatic considerations, to make funding decisions. We also
present examples of grants that we might fund in year 1, and we describe how we will ensure that all pilot
projects will comply with all applicable federal regulations."

This is the renewal application of a SPORE initiative from Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. We
focus on gliomas of children and young adults. Our objective is to develop therapies targeted to
oncogenic drivers and/or oncogene-induced vulnerabilities of these tumors. Towards these ends, basic
scientists join with clinician scientists from Boston Children’s Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. There are three projects:
 Project one targets pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs). Nearly 75% of pLGGs are driven
by truncation/fusion variants of the BRAF protein kinase. The project one team has made significant
contributions to development of tovorafenib – a brain penetrant type 2 RAF inhibitor that is effective
on all common BRAF oncoproteins. For this renewal application, the goals of project one are to
reduce variability in response to RAF inhibitors such as tovorafenib and develop non-invasive “child
friendly” tools to predict children most likely to require (and respond to) these drugs. Project two
targets diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) – the deadliest brain tumor of children. DMGs cannot be
cured by conventional therapeutic modalities and the prevalent oncogenic drivers are undruggable.
During the current funding period, the project two team has identified a synthetic lethal “addiction” to
the alternate end joining pathway for DNA repair (“alt-EJ”) and identified brain-penetrant drugs that
specifically target this pathway. Going forward, the goal of project two is to exploit alt-EJ repair
antagonists as targeted therapeutics for DMG. Project three addresses the early-stage (lower-
grade) IDH mutant gliomas (hereafter termed “IDHM”) of young adults. During the current funding
period, the project team identified synthetic lethal vulnerabilities for the more aggressive (WHO grade
4) IDHM gliomas. Going forward, the goal of project three is to integrate these synthetic lethal
therapeutic opportunities for grade 4 IDHM glioma into “the vorasidenib era” that has been opened by
the recent clinical studies on early stage (grade 2) IDHM gliomas of young adults.
 The study plan employs contemporary methods in structural biology, cancer genomics,
computer science and machine learning. Each project has a human endpoint, and two projects will
involve clinical trials. Rigor and reproducibility of work will be fostered by cores for Pathology and for
Biostatistics. An Administration core will enable and manage the multiple consortium agreements
and collaborative interactions Harvard Medical School, the four participating Harvard teaching
hospitals and facilitate clinical trials and imaging studies. Intellectual vigor within the program is
sustained and refreshed by annual Career Enhancement Awards to young investigators and by
annual Developmental Project Awards."
10943297,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are used by millions of Americans, however, we do not
understand their long-term health effects. Although ENDS use delivers far lower levels of carcinogens than
tobacco smoking, very little is known about whether ENDS use affects the risks of developing cardiovascular
(CV) or pulmonary diseases, two of the most highly prevalent causes of morbidity and mortality in the United
States. This research proposal will quantify the effects of long-term ENDS use on validated and novel biomarkers
of CV and pulmonary disease and how they are influenced by use heaviness, age, body weight, and co-use of
other products. This research also will shed additional light on long-term ENDS use patterns and ENDS
dependence. The importance of this study does not rest upon demonstrating adverse effects of ENDS use.
 We will recruit 400 long-term, stable users of ENDS and 200 age- and gender-matched control participants
who do not use ENDS or combustible cigarettes. They will undergo comprehensive biomarker assessments over
36 months. Biomarkers assess CV and pulmonary health status and risk and include vital signs, fasting blood
samples for systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, lipids, and markers of insulin resistance and
cardiometabolic health. Arterial structure changes will be assessed using carotid ultrasound and brachial artery
flow-mediated dilation. Sympathetic nervous system activation will be assessed by heart rate variability and
arterial diameters. For pulmonary measures, we will obtain non-contrast quantitative computed tomography (CT)
images to assess air trapping and texture-based measures of inflammation. We also will perform spirometry and
measure exhaled nitric oxide. Integrated cardiopulmonary health will be assessed via treadmill stress testing.
Other measures will include exhaled carbon monoxide, real-time measures of nicotine product use, nicotine
dependence, and use of cannabis and alcohol. Biomarker status over time will be compared across groups and
related to ENDS use heaviness, use of other products, and person factors (i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity,
weight, and smoking history). We will include ~130 participants who were phenotyped from 2019-2021.
 Our Primary Aim is to determine relationships between ENDS use heaviness and changes in our CV and
pulmonary biomarkers over 3 years. We will compare biomarker status across ENDS users and non-users over
time and examine associations between biomarker status and ENDS use heaviness within the ENDS user group.
Our Secondary Aim is to characterize changes in ENDS use patterns and dependence over time and to
determine how these are related to biomarker status changes and how they are influenced by the person factors
described above. Our primary and secondary CV measures are changes in carotid intima-media thickness and
grayscale median. Our primary and secondary pulmonary measures are the changes in the quantitative CT
measures of air trapping and parenchymal texture. This proposal will produce the most informative evidence to
date on how long-term ENDS use affects CV and pulmonary health and disease risk."
10943301,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a degenerative ocular disease affecting 4% of people over 40
and more that >300 million people globally. A hallmark of FECD is the accelerated loss of corneal endothelial
cells (CECs), which are required for maintaining corneal transparency and visual clarity. This study will
elucidate the underexplored regenerative potential of the corneal endothelium and use this knowledge to
devise innovative therapeutic interventions for FECD. Our hypothesis, grounded in preliminary experiments, is
that CECs, although naturally dormant, harbor an innate capacity for regeneration. Using innovative live
imaging approaches, genetic mouse models, and modified mRNA technology to manipulate CECs in vivo, we
identified a prospective therapeutic pathway: stimulating CEC proliferation in vivo to renew the corneal
endothelium, thus restoring corneal transparency and vision in FECD patients. To test this, we propose a two-
pronged approach utilizing relevant animal models. Aim 1 centers on elucidating the proliferative potential of
CECs in normal physiology and during FECD progression. Using established mouse models that recapitulate
the main features of FECD, we will perform real-time analysis of CEC dynamics by two-photon microscopy.
Moreover, we will investigate the molecular blueprint of a pro-regenerative endothelial cell identity, that can be
targeted for therapeutic intervention in FECD. For this we will perform in vivo assays of precision corneal
endothelial ablation combined with single-cell genomic analyses to elucidate the molecular programs that
influence the proliferation of CECs in vivo. To further illuminate the signaling pathways responsible for
regulating the cell cycle of CECs in response to changes of their biomechanical environment during FECD
disease progression, we will test the requirement of YAP, the downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, for
corneal endothelial function and regenerative ability. Aim 2 builds on our preliminary data demonstrating
effective control of CECs with injectable mRNA-encoded growth factors to induce their proliferation in vivo. We
propose a new mRNA-based therapy for FECD by directly targeting CECs to prompt the regeneration of a
diseased corneal endothelium, restoring its functionality. Toward this, we will systematically test the optimal
composition and delivery of our mRNA therapeutic factors to develop a robust treatment protocol. We will
comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of our mRNA treatment in two complementary mouse
models of early- and late-onset FECD, then scale up to pre-clinical trials in canine and non-human primate
models. Our team of investigators with deep expertise in regenerative biology and FECD disease modeling is
optimally equipped to carry out this research. With this study, we are aiming to not only revolutionize our
understanding of corneal endothelial physiology and FECD pathophysiology, but also develop groundbreaking
mRNA-based treatments to bring restored sight for patients with FECD and possibly other ocular degenerative
diseases closer to reality."
10943418,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated their efficacy in treating blood-based cancers.
However, the durability of responses is often hindered by challenges related to long-term T cell persistence and
engraftment. The success of CAR T cell immunotherapy relies on the differentiation status and overall fitness of
the CAR T cell product. Current protocols involve the activation and ex vivo expansion of patient T cells, however,
activation leads to irreversible differentiation, compromising their therapeutic potency.
Our recent work showed that a manufacturing protocol utilizing non-activated T cells results in superior
differentiation characteristics and reduced exhaustion, with concordant benefits in long-term tumor control.
Nevertheless, as quiescent T cells are highly resistant to lentiviral infection, CAR T manufacturing yield is a
significant limitation with non-activated T cells. The goal of this study is to harness the intrinsic stemness qualities
of non-activated CAR T cells and improve their transduction efficiency and effector function, thereby enhancing
their durable efficacy following infusion.
Quiescent T cells initiate a type I interferon (IFN1)-mediated innate response upon lentiviral vector transduction,
which limits CAR T cell transduction efficiency. Our preliminary data indicate that pre-treatment of non-activated
T cells with an IFN1-binding protein enhances CAR T cell transduction efficiency, and promotes a more naïve
and central memory phenotype. This research will delve into the impact of IFN1 blockade on CAR lentivirus
transduction and function of non-activated T cells, both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Given that
sustained type I IFN signaling facilitates tumor immune escape and resistance to therapies, we hypothesize that
continuous IFN1 blockade not only enhances T cell fitness by inhibiting the innate response to the lentiviral vector
but also amplifies the therapeutic efficacy of T cells in tumors reliant on IFN-mediated immune evasion. To
explore this further, we will evaluate the effect of sustained IFN1 blockade by constructing lentiviral transfer
plasmids encoding both a CAR and a secreted anti-IFN1 binding protein in various xenograft models of cancer.
Another key aspect of our investigation is the interplay between SAMHD1 and IFN1 signaling pathways in
quiescent T cells. SAMHD1 restricts nucleotide availability for reverse transcription and is upregulated by IFN1.
Given that Vpx, a component of natural HIV, degrades SAMHD1, we will assess the impact of Vpx incorporation
on the efficiency of reverse transcription and vector integration of CAR lentivirus in non-activated T cells. Our
hypothesis is that restoring Vpx, which targets rate-limiting steps of the viral transduction pathway,
will synergize
with IFN1 inhibition in quiescent T cells, ultimately enhancing lentiviral transduction efficiency and bolstering the
function in non-activated CAR T cells.
These studies represent a significant step toward enhancing T cell fitness by countering anti-viral defenses
triggered during manufacturing. We are dedicated to advancing the non-activated CAR T cell platform, with the
ultimate goal of improving the clinical potential of non-activated CAR T cells as a viable CAR therapy. Given our
well-established translational infrastructure, our findings hold immediate clinical relevance."

 Gynecologic malignancies accounted for over 114,810 new cancer cases and approximately 35,640
deaths in 2023 in the United States. Brachytherapy has been used to treat locally advanced cervical and
endometrial cancers since the early 20th century and is now part of the standard of care. Brachytherapy involves
the precise placement of short-range radioactive sources near or in direct contact with the tumor through thin
catheters, enabling high radiation doses in the target volume with rapid fall-off to protect adjacent normal
structures. Today, high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is commonly employed along with a computer-controlled
remote afterloading system, which allows accurate control of radiation dose for each catheter by adjusting the
“dwell time.” Though computer-controlled afterloading systems are widespread, the quality of brachytherapy is
still limited by suboptimal catheter placement. Clinicians often struggle to properly deploy the catheters in the
target volume because of the deviation of the catheters from the intended path during insertion and lack of
quantitative catheter position feedback or the dosimetric consequences resulting from the current catheter
locations. Intraoperative imaging, either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR), potentially
provides such feedback and allows for “adaptive catheter placement,” where the clinician adjusts catheter
location until optimal dosimetry is achieved. However, adaptive catheter placement is not practical in the current
form because it requires iterative implantation and imaging; each iteration involves positioning of the patient for
imaging and catheter placement and moving of the clinician between the imaging room and the control room. To
enable adaptive catheter placement in a wide range of clinical settings, we will develop a catheter placement
manipulator system that combines (1) a state-of-the-art fiber-optic shape-sensing stylet to obtain real-time
quantitative measurement of the catheter trajectories in the patient, and (2) a teleoperated catheter placement
manipulator to shorten the turnaround time for catheter placement and evaluation, (3) a visualization framework
that provides quantitative measures of a catheter’s deviation from its intended trajectory and real-time evaluation
of the consequences to the achievable radiation dose distribution. We hypothesize that the combination of real-
time catheter trajectory digitization and quick catheter insertion will allow adaptive catheter placement, where
the catheter locations are optimized through frequent iteration of the plan-insert-check cycle with real-time
quantitative dosimetry feedback, leading to optimal radiation dose distribution. We will pursue the following
specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a fiber-optic shape-sensing stylet for real-time catheter tracking to achieve real-
time tracking and prediction of the catheter trajectory for real-time feedback; (Aim 2) Develop a teleoperated
catheter insertion manipulator for quick catheter placement to achieve a shorter turnaround time for the frequent
plan-insert-check cycle; (Aim 3) Develop, optimize, and validate the system for teleoperated adaptive catheter
placement to test the impact of teleoperated adaptive catheter placement for optimal dose distribution."

Timely and accurate diagnosis of ocular infections is critical to guide early effective therapy and save vision.
However, because current methods for diagnosis of ocular infections are time-consuming and not sensitive,
empirical treatment with broad-spectrum therapies selected on the basis of clinical judgment continues to be the
mainstream approach. Since ocular infections are caused by a wide range of organisms, which may present with
overlapping features, many patients are treated unnecessarily with inappropriate antimicrobials. These broad-
spectrum scattershot approaches lead to increased toxicity, select for resistant bacteria, and are increasingly
compromised by the global emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR is a global pandemic that poses
a major threat to vision health, as ocular pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to first-line antimicrobials
used in ophthalmology. Unlike infections at many other sites, delays in diagnosis and in initiation of targeted
effective treatment of ocular infections can lead to serious consequences. Treatment failures or reduced efficacy
due to AMR can result in delayed infection resolution and consequences ranging from incremental visual loss to
loss of the eye. Metagenomic sequencing-based approaches are increasingly being explored to detect
pathogens and predict their antimicrobial resistances. Recent technological advancements now place the
development of rapid near point-of-care diagnostic tests that employ third-generation sequencers (e.g., Oxford
Nanopore) within reach. Our goal is to capitalize on these advances, and combine them with novel bioinformatic
tools for real time pathogen identification and methods for pathogen enrichment to create a completely
cultureless precision diagnostic tool for improved diagnosis of sight-threatening ocular infections. First, we will
develop and validate a practical metagenomic sequencing approach for rapid, sensitive and comprehensive
detection of bacteria, fungi and acanthamoeba from ocular samples using the portable Nanopore sequencer.
This will be accomplished using specimens derived from ex-vivo models of keratitis and endophthalmitis with
known microbial loads. Clinical validation will be performed using our existing large biorepositories of clinical
specimens collected from patients presenting with sight-threatening keratitis and endophthalmitis and additional
samples to be collected prospectively. Additionally, we will also adopt and validate direct association approaches
for antibiotic resistance prediction using the minimum of new sequence information necessary. At the
conclusion, we will have developed a rapid and culture-independent precision diagnostic approach that would
transform ocular infection diagnosis and treatment from an empirical one-size-fits-all approach to a precise and
more effective one tailored to the patient’s needs. This has the potential to significantly advance clinical
management and help improve the care of patients suffering from sight-threatening infections."

Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune digestive disease triggered by the consumption of gluten-containing
grains (the environmental trigger) in genetically predisposed individuals. The exact cause of CD is unknown as
research shows that genetic predisposition and exposure to gluten are necessary but not sufficient to trigger
the development of CD. A growing body of research supports the critical role of the gut microbiota in CD
pathogenesis as alterations in the gut microbiota composition (“gut dysbiosis”) have been associated with the
clinical manifestation and severity of CD. However, it is unclear whether the gut dysbiosis is the cause or the
consequence of intestinal inflammation in CD. This is because there are critical gaps in our knowledge about
molecular mechanisms and biochemical pathways through which the gut microbiota interacts with the host and
environment, and how precisely specific microbial species/strains contribute to a disrupted gut homeostasis
and the loss of gluten tolerance in CD. This proposal aims to build a mechanistic understanding of the
functional role of individual gut microbes and the gut microbiota as a whole in CD pathogenesis. To this end,
we will leverage multi-omics data and specimens collected before and at disease onset from at-risk subjects to
construct mechanistic in silico and ex vivo models of the gut microbiota and host. Our in silico models are
based on computational genome-scale models of metabolism and integrate diet (as an environmental risk
factor), the gut microbiota (at metagenome scale), and the host’s intestinal epithelial cells and macrophage into
one inclusive model. Our ex vivo models are based on patient-derived organoid co-cultures and integrate the
host’s intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages with microbial cues. By modeling germ-free and non-germ-
free human gut conditions using these in silico and ex vivo models, we aim to address two key objectives. First,
we will uncover specific gut microbial species/strains that are mechanistically linked to the production of
modulatory metabolites previously implicated in CD under different dietary regimens. Second, we will parse the
metabolic crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the host’s intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages
before and at disease onset. This integrative approach will allow us to uncover key microbial players in the gut
that individually or collectively trigger aberrant metabolic and immunometabolic responses by the host in the
early stages of disease development. Overall, this study paves the way for designing early intervention and
therapeutic strategies for CD that target specific gut microbial strains to re-establish the host’s immune and
metabolic homeostasis."
10931869,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The nuclear envelope (NE), a double-membrane structure surrounding the cell nucleus, and the nuclear pore
complex (NPC), the largest protein assembly residing in the NE, together govern paramount cellular
processes of the eukaryotic life, spanning chromatin organization, gene expression regulation,
nucleocytoplasmic transport, and signal transduction. Our laboratory is committed to studying diverse and
novel functions of the NE and NPC using plants as our model organisms. Our emphasis on plants stems
from their unique combination of both conserved and distinct NE and NPC-associated mechanisms evolved
in response to complex environmental challenges. In this proposal, we aim to leverage an integrated
proteomic, molecular, genetic, and bioinformatic approach, to achieve a mechanistic understanding of how
PNET1, a newly identified and evolutionarily conserved NPC membrane component, impacts mitotic
progression in undifferentiated cells. Concurrently, we seek to elucidate the central role played by the NPC
basket protein, GBPL3, in the precise regulation of stress-induced transcriptional reprogramming through the
gene gating mechanism. This research endeavor is expected to significantly advance our understanding of
fundamental biological principles underlying cell division and the regulation of gene expression occurring at

There is strong association between cannabis use and depression and suicide, but the underlying cellular links
are poorly understood. This presents a challenge for understanding how drug use can lead to additional
psychiatric disorders. It is believed that cannabis use alters the development of key brain regions which in turn
makes the brain more susceptible to additional stressors that could lead to major depressive disorder (MDD).
These findings are particularly concerning given the popularity of cannabis legalization. One of the key unsolved
problems is how to link drug use with specific molecular changes in the brain that can lead to depression. In this
proposal, we take the first steps to bridging this gap. First, we will use innovative single cell type postmortem
genomics to identify the molecular (transcriptomic and chromatin) changes occurring in the cannabis use
disorder (CUD) brain. We will focus our studies on two discreet brain regions: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
and the ventral striatum in 120 donors with CUD, MDD, and neurotypical controls. We will use reverse genetic
approaches to identify genomic alterations in the CUD brain that harbor GWAS risk signals for MDD. We
hypothesize that these alterations lead to widespread epigenomic changes that make the brain vulnerable to
stress and developing MDD. We will prioritize a credible set of genomic regions and genes and validate their
function in a human iPSC brain organoid model using massively parallel reporting assays (MPRA). We will also
test the effect THC (the active compound in cannabis) has on these organoids by comparing THC-exposed
organoids from donors with a history of CUD (but not MDD) with our MDD postmortem brain genomics to identify
convergent molecular mechanism changes. These studies will uncover genes driving MDD pathogenesis and
establish if cannabis use shares and drives these mechanisms. We expect this project will open new lines of
exploration in the comorbidity of substance use disorders and major depression and contribute broadly to
understanding the relationship between gene regulation and functional roles in cannabis use, which may identify
new therapeutic targets."

Although health professions (allied health, nursing, social work, clinical psychology) represent more than 80%
of the healthcare workforce, rigorous research within these fields, a cornerstone of evidence-based practice, is
often trailing behind that of other medical professions. The urgency of closing this gap is amplified for health
professionals practicing in communities characterized by poverty, low educational attainment, health care
access challenges and, consequently, poor health outcomes. Thus, building and strengthening HP biomedical
research capacity is vital to improving health and addressing health disparities.
The primary goal of the proposed study is to lay the foundation for a robust health professions research
environment at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), one of the largest Hispanic-Serving
Institutions in the nation. Located along the Texas-Mexico border, UTRGV serves one of the most economically
disadvantaged and medically underserved regions in the United States.
Guided by a conceptual framework that integrates multiple levels and domains of influence, our overall
objective is to engage the UTRGV HP community in a structured, comprehensive research needs assessment
and develop a corresponding action plan characterized by clear, feasible, measurable, sustainable, and
institutionally championed action items that support high-quality, cutting-edge biomedical research.
To achieve our objective, our multidisciplinary team will conduct an environmental scan, analyze research-
related policies and procedures, assess faculty research capacity and needs, examine the institutional
research support infrastructure, and explore student research support and opportunities. This will allow us to:
Aim 1. Identify the structural, systemic, social, and psychological factors impacting biomedical research
productivity of HP faculty.
Aim 2. Identify the critical interactions between factors, domains and levels of influence enabling and hindering
research productivity.
Aim 3. Develop an action plan to strengthen biomedical research capacity of HP faculty, with a focus on health
disparities research in the context of Hispanic/Latino culture.
Our work will add a much-needed perspective, without which the potential of health research to better
understand, deal more effectively with, and eliminate health disparities in underserved populations will not be
realized. The proposed assessment and action plan promise to build a multidisciplinary, interprofessional
biomedical research capacity that will uniquely position UTRGV to advance health research, support the
pipeline of the future biomedical research workforce, and serve as a research capacity building model for
minority-serving, resource-limited institutions."

Prospectively selecting an appropriate sequence of actions from a large number of alternatives requires
extensive computation. Although behavioral and modeling studies have advanced our understanding of how
the internal model of the animal’s environment might be interrogated to evaluate the outcomes of future
actions, the biological mechanisms of such computation remain poorly understood. In addition, new techniques
to monitor the activity of many neurons in multiple brain areas are enabling researchers to systematically test
theories of how temporally extended computations for high-order cognition like planning might be subserved by
broadly distributed neural activity. To capture these exciting opportunities, we have chosen to study the neural
basis of planning during the four-in-a-row task, which is both rich enough to keep the essential elements of
complex planning and tractable for rigorous computational and neurophysiological investigations. The objective
of the four-in-a row task is to place four consecutive stones in a grid before the opponent does so. This task
allows us to study the neural processes for iteratively evaluating possible outcomes or values of alternative
action sequences across many well-defined states. Recent work has characterized the computational
strategies of humans in this task and how they are refined during practice. In addition, our preliminary studies
show that non-human primates can be trained to perform the same task. In Aim 1, we will apply rigorous
statistical and machine learning techniques to understand how the animals use feature-based evaluation and
potentially tree search to make a move. In Aims 2 and 3, we will examine how computational aspects of
planning rely on the coordination between neural populations in fronto-striatal and fronto-hippocampal
networks. In Aim 2, we will simultaneously record the activity of many neurons in the dorsolateral and
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and in the caudate nucleus to test how these regions are involved in integrating
various task features during action selection. In Aim 3, we will simultaneously record from the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus to test whether dynamic changes in the state representation in the HPC are reflected by
successive transformation of neural signals related to values and actions in the PFC. We will also test whether
sequential moves decoded from neural activity in the HPFC and PFC during replays correspond to past and
future choices made by the animal. The results from these experiments will improve our understanding of how
the brain develops good plans adaptively."

This project will create two complementary quality measures focused on pediatric anxiety. Pediatric anxiety
disorders are the extremely prevalent and rates are rising rapidly. Without effective treatment, anxiety
disorders can lead to more severe anxiety, depression, and substance use. Moreover, unresolved anxiety
disorders can have profound effects on functioning into adulthood and increase the risk for depression,
suicide, and chronic medical disorders. Although pediatric anxiety interventions, such as cognitive behavioral
therapy and antidepressant medications, are highly efficacious, many clinicians are under-using these
evidence-based treatments. An outcome-focused anxiety quality measure would provide a new tool for
improving the quality of pediatric anxiety treatment. By comparing aggregate casemix-adjusted anxiety
treatment outcomes among clinicians, clinics, and populations, organizations could identify opportunities for
quality improvement.
An obstacle to creating outcome-focused mental health measures in the United States has been the
absence of a practical way to collect, aggregate, and report mental health symptoms/functioning on
thousands of patients before and after treatment. We will develop and test two complementary casemix-
adjusted pediatric anxiety outcome quality measures using the GAD-7: (1) a measure of whether patients are
responding to treatment (treatment response), and (2) a whether patients’ anxiety remitted, which should be
feasible to implement at scale. Our specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1. Develop and test two complementary casemix-adjusted pediatric anxiety symptom quality measures.
Aim 2. Assess whether there are differences in anxiety outcomes by race, ethnicity, and social risk factors.
Aim 3. Determine how the measure will be implemented and used for quality improvement (feasibility and
usability).
Aim 4. Submit the quality measures for endorsement.
The GAD-7 is a widely used seven-item anxiety questionnaire that is psychometrically reliable, valid, and
responsive to change in pediatric and adult samples. Critically, the GAD-7 is easy for both specialty and
primary care providers to incorporate into their daily workflow and captures the primary symptoms of most
prevalent anxiety disorders, thus overcoming the main challenge to outcome-based mental health quality
measures. Large mental health systems in England, and more recently in Norway, Australia, and Northern
Ireland already use remission and response measures based on the GAD-7 to monitor outcomes on
thousands of pediatric patients with anxiety to inform quality improvement efforts."

Growing evidence suggests that adaptive value representations in the brain are critical to flexible decision making. Inflexible
decisions are a hallmark of a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, understanding the typical neural substrates of value
representation may provide critical insights into the patterns of disordered decisions that characterize pathological
conditions. Convergent evidence over the past decades points to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as a critical locus for value
representation and adaptive decisions. Evidence for neural encoding of the value of choice options is abundant, but it is less
well appreciated that such representations are also intertwined with spatial information the reflects the location where the
outcomes in question will be delivered. The utility—if any—of these pervasive OFC spatial representations is unknown.
This is at least partly due to the fact that most studies of OFC’s role in decision making involve subjects that make their
choices with minimal, if any, movement. We hypothesize that OFC spatial representations are a neural substrate for spatial
credit assignment, the process by which organisms learn to associate locations with the value of outcomes those locations
predict. Drawing inspiration from decision problems that foraging animals face in natural settings, we developed two new
behavioral tasks for rats that require spatial credit assignment. In the patch-leaving task rats shuttle between two foraging
patches where food pellets are delivered at different rates. The longer rats remain in one foraging patch, the lower the rate
of reward becomes. Switching between patches resets the reward rate to its maximal level, but incurs a time penalty in the
form of delay, during which food is not available. Adaptive decision making requires rats to associate information about
reward rate with each patch. In the value-map task, rats are trained to approach visual stimuli projected on to the floor of an
open-field arena, and are reinforced probabilistically for successfully completing trials. Reward probability is determined
by an uncued underlying probability map with localized regions where reward is more or less likely to be delivered.
Choosing correctly on choice trials requires learning the underlying probability structure of the task, and attributing higher
or lower value to locations in the arena with increased or decreased reward probability. Preliminary data demonstrate that
rats successfully perform both of these tasks. Neural recordings in lateral OFC identified two classes of spatially-responsive
neuron, one of which encodes space coarsely, over a large scale, and the other of which encodes space over a much finer
scale exhibiting discrete firing fields at particular locations. We hypothesize that these spatial cells are recruited to represent
value over large spatial scales (as required by the patch-leaving task) or finer spatial scales (as required by the value-map
task). Combining electrophysiology, modelling, and chemogenetic manipulations, we will quantify spatial representations
across the medial-lateral axis of OFC, assess how OFC spatial representations are modified by spatial value learning, and
test the role of cortio-hippocampal interactions in these processes. This work will provide the first detailed characterization
of the prevalence, form, and dynamics of medial and lateral OFC spatial responses, and take the first steps towards
understanding their role in value-based decision making."

Up to 33% of women and 16% of men report experiencing intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV), and sexual
minority (SM) individuals are 2.5 times more likely to experience IPSV than heterosexual individuals. Yet, little
research has examined proximal and temporal predictors of IPSV among couples. The impetus for this project is
to address five critical gaps in the current scientific evidence base on IPSV: (1) the role of alcohol in IPSV, both
as a predictor and an outcome, has been largely overlooked in research despite alcohol being a contributing cause
and consequence of non-sexual partner violence, (2) most research on IPSV is cross-sectional, which prevents
identification of causal predictors, (3) current research on IPSV fails to take into account dyadic associations
(e.g., effects of each partner's alcohol use, how each partner communicates sex consent and refusal), (4) there
are no empirically supported theoretical models of IPSV, and (5) past research on IPSV has over-relied upon
heterosexual relationships to the exclusion of SM couples. Using rigorous experimental and intensive
longitudinal designs—the goal standard for establishing proximal and temporal relationships—the overall
objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of alcohol and sexual communication (i.e., consent and
refusal) on IPSV, which will inform an etiological model for IPSV. The aims of proposal are to (1) examine the
effects of one's own and one's partner's acute alcohol use and partner sexual communication refusal (indirect
verbal vs. direct verbal) on laboratory IPSV perpetration (Aim 1), (2) examine the effects of event-level alcohol
use and sexual communication (indirect vs direct, verbal vs non-verbal) on IPSV perpetration over time (Aim 2),
and (3) explore similarities and differences between SM and heterosexual couples (Exploratory Aim). Across two
studies, 440 couples (50% cisgender SM, 50% cisgender heterosexual) with a history of partner violence and
heavy drinking will be recruited, wherein at least one member identifies as a man. In Study 1, using a couple-
level 4x2 design with 240 couples (n = 480 participants), SM and non-SM couples will be separately block-
randomized into eight experimental conditions corresponding to: (1) one of four couple-level beverage
conditions (alcohol/alcohol, alcohol/no-alcohol, no-alcohol/alcohol, no-alcohol/no-alcohol for Actor/Partner)
and (2) one of two couple-level partner sexual communication conditions (direct/indirect refusal), and then
complete validated laboratory paradigm for IPSV perpetration ostensibly against their partner. In Study 2, 200
couples (n = 400 participants) will complete 26 weekly assessments measuring alcohol use, sexual
communication (indirect/direct, verbal/nonverbal) and IPSV for each day of the prior week. This proposal is in
direct response to NOT-AA-23-003 in that findings will inform etiological models of the association between
individual and contextual factors for intimate partner violence perpetration over time, with a particular focus on
understudied SM populations. In doing so, this project will offer valuable insights that can inform future
interventions aimed at reducing sexual violence within SM and heterosexual couples."

Early life environments can have profound and long-lasting effects on human health, yet the mechanistic basis
of these effects remain poorly understood as do the factors that explain inter-individual variation. These gaps in
knowledge severely limit our ability to both predict susceptible individuals and to develop effective intervention
strategies. At the molecular level, early life effects on later life health are thought to be mediated by stable
changes in gene regulation. However, many gene regulatory elements are responsive to environmental stimuli
throughout life, making it challenging to isolate the effects of early life conditions or to understand their stability,
especially when within-lifetime environmental variation is absent or longitudinal data are not available. My
research program aims to overcome these challenges by working with two subsistence-level groups: 1) the
Turkana of Kenya, who are experiencing rapid lifestyle change such that early life and adult conditions are largely
decoupled and 2) the Tsimane of Bolivia, who have been followed longitudinally for decades. In both groups, I
will generate genome-wide gene regulatory datasets (DNA methylation, gene expression) paired with information
on environmental experiences and health, allowing me to identify the mechanisms that embed early life
exposures into lifelong physiology. I will also generate genome-wide genotype data for each individual, in order
to ask whether genetic variation predicts sensitivity versus resilience to early life challenges at the gene
regulatory level. Finally, I will complement this field-based, observational work with lab-based methods capable
of testing for causal connections between 1) DNA methylation and gene expression and 2) genotype and
environmentally-induced gene expression, both in high-throughput. In doing so, this project will uncover the gene
regulatory mechanisms that mediate early life effects on health, as well as the degree to which these
relationships are modified by genetic variation. By working “in the field” and “in the lab”, the proposed work will
inform our understanding of developmental and environmental processes in natural human populations as well
as causal mechanisms. More broadly, the proposed projects will link a major global phenomenon—increasing
urbanization and market-integration—with gene regulatory processes and health in two understudied and
underserved populations (Africans and Amerindians). It will also generate new methods and resources that will
inform our understanding of the general patterns of genotype x environment interactions in human complex traits."

Overview of research: Research in my lab centers on marine regenerative biology and specifically on stem
cell-mediated regeneration. Our research organism is the hydrozoan cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus.
Hydractinia is a colonial invertebrate that has evolved a remarkable stem cell system and an astonishing
capacity for regeneration. This animal can regenerate all of its tissues throughout life, owing to the constant
turnover of its migratory stem cells, known as i-cells. The i-cell population is functionally heterogeneous and
recently, fast-cycling and slow-cycling ‘quiescent’ sub-populations of i-cells have been identified based on cell
cycle characteristics. Together with collaborators, we recently sequenced and assembled the Hydractinia
genome and have created fluorescent transgenic lines. The genomic resources we have created and the
functional molecular tools that currently exist and are under development for gene loss- and gain-of-function
experimentation are enabling a new era of Hydractinia research.
Goals for next five years: Our first goal is to successfully isolate purified sub-populations of stem cells from
Hydractinia. Once this is achieved, we will work to characterize the essential nature of the i-cell sub-
populations using global single cell transcriptional profiling (single cell RNAseq), followed by careful functional
genetic experimentation. We will aim to characterize the underlying mechanisms governing i-cell maintenance
during homeostasis and deployment during regeneration.
Overall vision: My overall vision is to significantly contribute to the field of regenerative medicine by
establishing Hydractinia as an exciting new research organism for stem cell and regeneration research.
Hydractinia has a combination of traits such as small size, transparency, short generation times, and easy
access to embryos that make it ideal for model organism development. As one of a handful of highly
regenerative animals that can be easily cultured, spawned, and manipulated in the lab, Hydractinia is poised to
help us unlock the mysteries and mechanisms that govern stem cell quiescence and proliferation. Our studies
will characterize stem cell function in the contexts of normal tissue homeostasis and throughout the diverse
molecular and cellular events of regeneration. One major long-term goal is to provide a means to specifically
target and activate quiescent stem cells in vivo to enhance tissue regeneration that may ultimately be applied
to human cells."

High- and low-level computations for coordination of orofacial motor actions
 Neuronal circuits in the brainstem integrate control of life-sustaining motor actions, such as breathing and
feeding, with exploratory motor actions, such as sniffing, licking, nose and head turning, and, for rodents,
whisking. All of these contain a rhythmic component that is entrained by the breathing cycle. What are the
underlying circuits that produce these motor actions and how are they coordinated into flexible behaviors? Our
hypothesis is that high-level rhythmic signals use feedback to modulate the phase of low-level oscillator activity
on a cycle-wise basis. High-level broadband signals also regulate set-point and posture of effectors. Together,
low- and high-level signals lead to coordinated and precise rhythmic behaviors to achieve sensory goals.
We address our hypothesis using two theoretical concepts and a plethora of experimental procedures. One
theoretical concept is control theory. This concept emphasizes internal models, that is, computations that yield
signals to drive a physical plant, such as the vibrissae or the tongue, that respect the innervation of the
musculature. Control theory also emphasizes the role of feedback signals to correct the timing of rhythmic
actions. The second theoretical concept is coupled oscillators circuits, one for each rhythmic action with an
overall ""coordinator"". These guide schemes for the continual adjustment rhythmic action phases to form a precise
behavior. Theoretical guidance was pivotal toward the discovery of the oscillator for whisking, identify a
mechanism brain used to create a hierarchy of oscillators, and identifying modularity in the control of movement.
We seek to discover a second fundamental oscillator in the brainstem, one that controls chewing and licking.
In parallel, we will complete a biomechanical model of the tongue that includes changes in shape and turgidity
based on motor innervation of the muscles and the control of blood flow by local parasympathetic neurons.
Together with whisking and joint vibrissa and head movement, these are a trifecta of targets for high-level control.
A novel concept in our proposal is the fine control of rhythmic motion by high-level feedback to refine the
relative timing of different rhythm motor actions. Thus head position, tongue position, possibly whisker position
are optimized in the context of a behavior. We address this possibility through three interdependent approaches:
anatomical tracing of molecularly identified high-level cell types to molecularly identified low-level targets in the
medulla; recording and perturbing signals in superior colliculus that influence head orientation and whisking; and
recording and perturbing cortical signals that influence licking.
 The collective expertise of our Team bridges state-of-the-art anatomical, behavioral, computational,
molecular, and physiological technologies. We have historically adhered to the highest standards in
experimentation, analysis, and theory. Critically, we are joined by top trainees in a diverse workforce committed
to progress on motor control, and we are dedicated to educating our trainees in a culture of curiosity and
scholastic excellence."

Confluence of high- and low-level signaling for the control of orofacial rhythmic motor actions
 Orofacial actions are nominally comprised of two components: a rhythm that can be entrained by the
breathing oscillator, i.e., the preBötzinger complex (pBötC), and a broadband component that directs the actuator
to the region-of-interest. Project 1 addresses both low-level, via pBötC, and high-level means to coordinate the
rhythmic components of actions into a behavior. We hypothesize that the precise timing of each constituent
action is continually adjusted through the merge of pBötC and reflex input within the brainstem and a sensory-
derived, high-level feedback signal(s). This Project focuses primarily on whisking and the synergy of whisking
and head turning. It serves, in part, as a blueprint for proposed studies on the low- and high-level coordination
of licking and chewing in all other Projects.
 Our first goal is to construct theoretical models of coupled oscillator circuits that provide insight into the
signals needed to control the phase of multiple low-level oscillators through a single high-level coordinator. The
models are abstractions of biological reality. Yet they are tractable and provide guidance on plausible scenarios
for the fine control of timing in orofacial motor actions whose movements are coordinated to form behaviors.
 At the low-level, we consider the nature of the inputs from the breathing oscillator pBötC in mice. Are the
initial phases of each motor action, relative to breathing, set by phase-specific projections from the pBötC? Or
are they set by the synapses and promotor circuits that transform the pBötC inputs? We use deep imaging of
pBötC projection neurons that are functionally labeled by their molecular phenotype and their downstream
target(s). These data will constrain the capability of low-level signals to provide the initial phase relations among
different motor actions.
 At the high-level, we consider signals that originate in the deep motor layers of the superior colliculus (SCm)
that provide inputs to vibrissa motoneurons and, from our preliminary data, further provide input to whisking
oscillator cells. We will examine how signals from the SCm shift the timing of whisking relative to pBötC signals
using deep imaging and functional perturbations in mice. We will also test the role of the SCm to coordinate and
finely control concurrent motor actions in freely behaving rats that perform an orientation-search-consumption
task. The reliability of the combined motor actions, analyzed with respect to the variability of optical and
extracellular recordings from SCm neurons, directly tests our hypothesis and supports or falsifies specific
models. The results will reveal the interplay among autonomous low-level and conditional high-level signaling."

The shape, movement, and signals of active sensors: Modeling the neuronal control and biomechanics
of deformable orofacial organs (Golomb as lead; all PIs contribute)
 This Project addresses the dynamics of the neuronal circuits and their associated motor plants that underlie
different orofacial motor actions. We focus on two actions: whisking, driven by the vibrissa system, and licking,
driven by the lingual system. The proposed studies on the vibrissa system build on the relative plethora of
information on this orofacial action, as well as includes new data. In contrast, the proposed studies on the licking
system make extensive use of new data that is gathered in the Team experimental projects.
 Models of each system include neurological centers, i.e., sensory, motor, premotor, and pre2motor nuclei
and ganglia, and biomechanical elements, i.e., the vibrissae, its mystacial pad, and the tongue. We will use
theoretical and computational techniques, together with new experiments, to describe how motor actions emerge
from these centers and elements. We further explain how active feedback alters motor activity during active
sensing. For the case of the tongue, we model two strong nonlinearities:the 1:n and n:m entrainment of breathing
with licking and the potnetial loss of entrainment of the tongue and jaw by breathing as the animal chews.
 In Aims 1 and 2 will complete our analysis of the interaction between the vibrissae and the motor plant. Our
preliminary results show that a vibrissa functions as an elastic beam for distal objects and as a rigid body for
proximal objects. Using data from Project 1 to build a model that predicts spikes and object location from vibrissa
touch, we further investigate how ascending low-level inputs via the brainstem loop together with descending
high-level inputs control motor activity during behavior. Aims 3 and 4 are related to the tongue. We will construct
and analyze hydrostatic models of the tongue, including intrinsic and extrinsic muscles as well as vascularization,
that will describe changes in the shape of the tongue in responses to motor commands in foraging and in
consumption; these yield predictions for Project 5. In Aim 4, we further define how brainstem nuclei generate the
licking rhythm and its amplitude and how they are entrained by breathing oscillators. This study is carried out
interactively with experimental groups through Projects 1, 3, and 4."

will train next-generation researchers to formulate and conduct studies in close collaboration with and
responsive to the actual interests, needs, and priorities of health care system stakeholders. To illuminate and
better understand variation in practice and outcomes and the barriers of T4 translation, the interdisciplinary
curriculum and mentored hands-on research opportunities of the new T32 program interweave the scientific
expertise and mentoring experience of 27 multidisciplinary faculty who are committed to collaborative, team-
based cross-training and research in health services and patient-centered outcomes, clinical epidemiology,

10932882,"Project Summary
 Virus-host interactions drive a remarkable diversity of host immune responses and viral countermeasures
during host-pathogen coevolution. Identifying and characterizing virus-host interactions within this evolutionary
“arms race” is critical for understanding how the outcome of these interactions favor either productive pathogen
replication or abortive infection. Furthermore, if one can identify pathogen-encoded immune evasion proteins
(IEPs), they might be exploited to discover and probe the cellular machinery they target. We are developing new
approaches to identify IEPs that target conserved eukaryotic machinery and are capable of tipping the balance
between abortive and productive viral infection. While classical approaches have employed virus-host models
wherein the virus can productively infect the chosen host, we have developed a new paradigm that exploits
naturally abortive arbovirus infections in lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) cells as a screening tool to identify
novel IEPs encoded by mammalian pathogens that convert abortive infections to productive infections by
countering host immune responses. By identifying IEPs encoded by mammalian pathogens that retain
immunosuppressive function in insect cells, we can select for IEPs that target antiviral machinery conserved
between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Using this approach, we have identified several IEPs encoded by
mammalian pathogens that target conserved host machinery that we have subsequently found to perform
antiviral functions. For example, one current area of focus is the characterization of poxvirus-encoded A51R
proteins as a new family of mammalian IEPs that target the facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex,
an evolutionarily-conserved histone chaperone complex, that inhibits cytoplasmic virus replication in insect and
human cells. Using A51R proteins to probe FACT functions, we discovered that a post-translationally modified
form of a FACT complex subunit is bound by A51R proteins and mislocalized to the cytoplasm during poxvirus
infection. We also found several, unrelated RNA viruses to encode IEPs that prevent and/or reverse FACT
subunit modification. Using virological, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we aim to reveal how viral IEPs
impede FACT complex activity, the role of FACT in determining host susceptibility to infection, and the function(s)
of FACT subunit post-translational modification in both antiviral and normal cellular processes. Finally, we are
developing a pipeline to exploit our arbovirus-lepidopteran host system to identify additional IEPs targeting
conserved host factors that act as key determinants of intracellular pathogen restriction. Using this pipeline, we
identified ~10 IEPs encoded by bacterial pathogens infecting mammals that relieve arbovirus restriction in insect
cells, suggesting these IEPs target host defenses that broadly restrict viruses and bacteria. Our overall mission
is to identify novel IEPs encoded by mammalian pathogens in our unique system and use them to provide
mechanistic insights into the antiviral (and normal) functions of the conserved host machinery they manipulate."
10933922,"Core C has two overarching goals: (1) to provide reliable and technically consistent complex murine models
of lung transplantation to identify pathways causally linked to primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and chronic
lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD); (2) to provide the Project investigators expertise with established and
emerging technology platforms for advanced phenotyping of mice and human tissues after lung
transplantation. All four Projects will use these tools to test and validate their hypotheses. Because the
technologies deployed by Core C generate unbiased data that can inform multiple studies, Core C will work
with Core A to make this resource available to all PPG investigators and the research community. Achieving
these goals will provide the PPG investigators with (1) quantitative insights into the molecular pathways that
underlie the development of PGD and CLAD, (2) pathways that drive the enhanced incidence of allograft
dysfunction in the presence of clinical risk factors, and (3) measurements of the response to current
therapeutic strategies as well as novel, validated protein targets for therapeutic intervention. Accordingly,
the Cell Phenotyping and Mouse core (Core C) will support all four scientific projects by focusing on the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Provide well-characterized murine models of murine orthotopic lung
transplant and live cell imaging of immune infiltration into the allograft. Core C investigators have
published extensively using murine lung transplant PGD models and chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Core
C measures of PaO2/FIO2 ratio, flow cytometry assessment of lung inflammatory cell populations, lung fibrosis
measurements, murine pulse oximetry, and in vivo live imaging through a surgically placed window to
accurately phenotype these models. Aim 2. Provide a multi-omic assessment of lung injury and fibrosis
after lung transplantation using homologous approaches to those used in humans. Core C
investigators have developed protocols to process lung tissue for various techniques that would undergo
multi-omic bioinformatics analyses by Core B. These techniques include flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-
seq/CITE seq, microbiome analysis, TCR profiling, whole genome DNA methylation assays, proteomics,
and metabolomics. Core C will collaborate with Core C for the sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of
murine tissues processed by Core C. Aim 3: Perform breeding and genotyping of all the murine strains,
including the generation of tissue- and cell-type-specific knockout and reporter animals required by
the Project Investigators. Core C will breed wild-type and genetically engineered mice, including global
knockouts, conditional knockouts, and transgenic and overexpressing mice, to generate inducible cell-type-
and tissue-specific knockout or overexpressing mice. Core C will maintain a centralized database of all
animals and perform strategic planning according to experimental plans proposed by individual Project
Leaders."
10932776,"ICAL ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: SUMMARY
This is a resubmission of the renewal application for the NIDA Center of Excellence, Impact of
Cannabinoids Across the Lifespan (ICAL). The Center tests the hypothesis that non-physiological
activation of the endocannabinoid system during adolescence – caused by exposure to D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – initiates a reprogramming of the molecular processes that govern this
system, ultimately producing persistent abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and behavior. ICAL’s
Administrative Core serves as the organizational hub for ICAL’s scientific and programmatic activities.
In its first 4-year funding period, the Core: (a) organized two international symposia with
>1800 registrants from 127 global locations; (b) hosted multiple workshops, webinars, and
student-directed teaching activities; (c) supported and/or trained 47 undergraduate students
(22 from underrepresented minorities, URM), 9 graduate students (5 from URM), and 5
postdoctoral scholars (2 from URM); and (d) contributed to the establishment of a new NIDA-
funded T32 Training Program in Substance Use and Use Disorders (PIs: Wood and Piomelli).
If renewed, the Core will continue to oversee and integrate the activities of ICAL’s research projects,
shared research cores, pilot core, and outreach programs. The Core director, D. Piomelli, is
Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry and
Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Louise Turner Arnold Chair in the Neurosciences, and director of the
UCI Center for the Study of Cannabis. The core co-director, M. Wood, is Professor and Chair in the
Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, and director of the Irvine Center for Addiction
Neuroscience. In the previous funding period, Piomelli and Wood assembled an External Advisory
Group (EAG) composed of leaders in the field of cannabinoid research and addiction neuroscience,
who have agreed to continue serving if ICAL is renewed. With support from an Administrative
Specialist acting as Center Coordinator, Piomelli will manage workflow, coordinate meetings,
facilitate interaction with ICAL’s SC and EAG and other stakeholders, track and report the Center’s
progress, identify challenges, and implement solutions. The Center Coordinator will also be
responsible for budget management and reporting, drafting, and maintaining of animal protocols,
generating content for ICAL’s website and other communications, and for coordinating and
scheduling all meetings, seminars, workshops, and outreach events. The combined expertise of the
Administrative Core’s leadership and staff will ensure that ICAL’s scientific and programmatic goals
are met and disseminated to cannabinoid researchers as well as to the scientific community and the
public."
10932777,"ICAL ANIMAL CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Center of Excellence Impact of Cannabinoids Across the Lifespan (ICAL), the renewal of which is
proposed in this revised application, deploys a vertically integrated strategy that combines molecular,
synaptic, and behavioral approaches to test the hypothesis that adolescent cannabis use reprograms
the endocannabinoid signaling system at the molecular and cellular level, producing persistent
abnormalities in its function and, ultimately, in cognition and motivated behavior. In the first funding
period, which lasted 4 years, the Animal Core (1) developed and validated (in collaboration with
the Analytical Core) a THC treatment regimen that captures key features of daily cannabis use
in adolescence, a use pattern that is increasingly common among teenagers [80]; (2) produced
~5,000 animal subjects for ICAL projects and pilot grantees; (3) created a public repository of
tissues from male and female mice and rats treated with THC in adolescence, which distributed
>500 biospecimens to six laboratories in the USA and abroad in a period of ~12 months; (4)
characterized the adult metabolic, nociceptive, and immune phenotype of mice of both sexes
exposed to THC in adolescence. The studies have produced three published articles and one in
preparation. In this renewal, the Core has three aims: Aim 1: Continue to implement ICAL’s THC
treatment protocol to support projects and seed grantees. The Core will also conduct focused
phenotyping investigations on the impact of THC on processes that (a) can affect the interpretation of
data generated by ICAL projects; and/or (b) may have direct or indirect repercussions on cognition,
affect, and motivation. Aim 2: Maintain and expand ICAL’s tissue repository. The Core will increase the
bank’s inventory and aggressively publicize its services through periodic email and social media
campaigns. Aim 3: Produce genetically modified mouse lines for ICAL projects. The experiments
proposed in this renewal application require the development of several mouse lines carrying cell-
selective deletions of CB1 cannabinoid receptor or fatty acid amide hydrolase. The Core will (a)
generate the lines from available ‘flanked by LoxP’ (‘floxed’) and Cre recombinase mutants; (b)
characterize their pharmacokinetic profile after THC administration; and (c) make them available for
ICAL projects and the research community."
10932779,"ICAL PILOT CORE: SUMMARY
This is a revised application for the renewal of the NIDA Center of Excellence, Impact of Cannabinoids
Across the Lifespan (ICAL). The Center tests the hypothesis that non-physiological activation of the
endocannabinoid system during adolescence – caused by exposure to D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) –
initiates a reprogramming of the genetic and epigenetic processes that govern this system’s molecular
structure, neuroanatomical architecture, and synaptic functions, ultimately producing persistent
abnormalities in cognition and motivated behavior. In this revised application for renewal, ICAL’s Pilot
Core will continue to fulfill two major programmatic objectives of the Center: (1) foster innovative research
that aligns with the Center’s scientific mission and maximizes use of its research resources; and (2)
provide career development activities and mentorship for junior investigators and/or established
investigators who are new to cannabinoid research. In the first 4-year funding period, the Core
supported seven projects, which provided evidence that daily exposure to THC in adolescence
produces: (a) disruptions in male and female reproductive function in mice (projects 6 and 7); (b)
sex-dependent alterations in extracellular vesicle signaling in the rat brain (project 3); (c)
microstructural changes in the brain of male mice (project 5); and (d) alterations in reward-related
behaviors (projects 1 and 4). Moreover, (e) one R01 and one R01-level California State grant
applications were funded based on results produced by project 3; and (f) three articles were
published and several others are in preparation. For this renewal, the Core plans to continue its
annual competition for pilot funding. Its Director, Dr. Christine Gall, is Professor and Chair of the
Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology and Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior at UCI. Dr. Gall
will supervise the recruitment of projects and oversee their progress in consultation with the Center
director and co-director, the internal Steering Committee (SC) and External Advisory Group (EAG). The
Center’s Administrative Core will provide clerical support. Early-career investigators and/or investigators
new to the field who receive ICAL pilot funding will be paired with senior faculty members who will provide
mentorship during the project funding period and after research is completed. In addition, pilot grantees
will have access to the leadership and expertise of the SC and the EAG. The Pilot Core will continue
serving as a conduit for the exploration of new ideas and as an important venue for mentoring both junior
investigators and established investigators new to the field. The Core’s leadership will work to ensure that
the potential for each individual project and project investigator is fully realized."
10932782,"ICAL BEHAVIORAL PROJECT: PROJECT SUMMARY
Early cannabis use is associated with long-term psychiatric risks including susceptibility to abuse of
harder drugs like opioids. Yet in humans it is difficult to determine the impact of adolescent THC exposure
(ado-THC) itself, versus underlying comorbidities or societal factors that also contribute to the
association. Despite their shortcomings, rodent models are thus still crucial for establishing causal,
biological influences of ado-THC on addiction susceptibility. Indeed, preclinical studies suggested that
ado-THC conveys later susceptibility to opioids. In the first funding period, we confirmed and
extended this finding, demonstrating that ado-THC causes a sex-dependent vulnerability in rats:
males show a pre-sensitized locomotor response to heroin, while females show greater heroin
place preference and economic demand for a fentanyl derivative. Regardless of founded criticisms
of the THC “gateway effect,” such robust findings, seen across labs and behavioral models, cannot be
ignored. How might adolescent THC promote opioid reward? Adolescence is a period of active brain
maturation, especially in late-developing structures like the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Microglia, the
resident immune cells of the brain parenchyma, play a key role in this process. Initially thought to respond
solely to insults by attaining an “activated” phenotype with cytokine release and other pro-inflammatory
processes, microglia do much more than counteract physical threats. Indeed, drugs of abuse like opioids
recruit incompletely understood microglial processes which seem to be essential for the acutely
reinforcing effects of opioids, as well as longer-term progression of use into addiction. Indeed, our
preliminary data support the hypothesis that ado-THC impact microglia in short and long
timeframes, and that these changes may be involved in the pro-opioid, sex-dependent phenotype.
We test this novel hypothesis in three Aims: 1) determining how ado-THC and heroin impact microglial
protein and RNA markers, and whether “resetting” microglia in adulthood selectively reverses ado-THC
behavioral effects, 2) determining the precise developmental stages at which ado-THC has the most
pronounced long-term pro-opioid effects, and 3) determining the mechanisms required for ado-THC to
have its persistent effects on microglia and behavior, and whether these are the same or different from
those underlying Molecular and Synaptic Project findings. These studies, especially in the context of our
integrated Center-wide research program, will break new ground in understanding the roles played by
microglia in opioid addiction, and in the neurodevelopmental consequences of adolescent use of drugs
like cannabis."
10933317,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER EPIGENETICS RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Cancer Epigenetics (CE) Research Program is
composed of 26 members from nine departments and co-led by Ramin Shiekhattar, PhD, and David Lombard,
MD, PhD, who bring complementary expertise and knowledge to the program. CE aims to pinpoint epigenetic
factors and mechanisms that contribute to cancer risk, initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. It
endeavors to develop innovative approaches to epigenetics research to mitigate the impact of cancer in
Sylvester’s catchment area (CA), a highly diverse four-county area known as South Florida (SoFL). The CE
program’s three specific aims are to 1) elucidate the oncogenic molecular mechanisms associated with
epigenetic regulators that are mutated or dysregulated in cancer; 2) define the enhancer and transcriptional
reprogramming imposed by aberrant signal transduction and altered metabolism in cancer; and 3) identify and
validate epigenetic mechanisms and targets as the basis for biomarker development and therapeutic
intervention. CE members receive $4.6M in annual direct peer-reviewed funding, with $1.6M from the NCI and
$1.5M in 11 multi-principal investigator (MPI) grants. During the current reporting period (6/1/2018-5/31/2023),
CE members published 252 cancer-related papers; 20% represent intra-programmatic, 32% represent inter-
programmatic, and 82% reflect multi-institutional collaborations. Forty-four percent of CE’s publications are in
top-tier journals with an impact factor greater than ten. CE works collaboratively with Tumor Biology to
understand the interplay between oncogenic signaling and epigenetic dysregulation in cancer, with Cancer
Control to understand how environmental and socio-economic disparities impact the epigenome and influence
cancer initiation and progression, and with Translational and Clinical Oncology to translate findings made by
CE researchers into clinical trials. These efforts are supported by NCI and NIH R01 grants, Department of
Defense awards, and a newly awarded Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Specialized Center of Research
program project grant. CE’s research efforts leverage Sylvester’s Shared Resources (SRs), particularly the
Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, Cancer Modeling, Biospecimen, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics SRs.
Major CE discoveries during the reporting period include the 1) paradigm-shifting demonstration that the
Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 promotes estrogen receptor-dependent oncogenic gene expression in breast
cancer; 2) elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms underlying the changes in enhancer function in hematopoietic
stem cells in the aging process, relevant to Sylvester’s aging and cancer cross-cutting theme and its large and
diverse elderly population in its CA; and 3) demonstration that targeting LSD1 can potentiate the clinical activity
of differentiation therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. CE strives to
elucidate basic epigenetic abnormalities underlying cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance,
and mechanisms that can be targeted to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments."

The Administrative Core manages the Center for Targeted Therapeutics (CTT) at the University of South
Carolina (USC) in all of its organizational, fiscal, reporting, program building, communication, and evaluation
aspects. During CTT COBRE Phase 3, the Administrative Core will have the following aims: 1). To manage all
the organizational, fiscal, scientific oversight, communication, reporting and evaluation aspects of the CTT. To
attain this, the Administrative Core will coordinate and promote the activities of the three research cores of the
CTT, interact with other USC components for the fiscal management of the CTT, organize the meetings of the
Advisory Committee (AC); collect, organize and redistribute as appropriate all the information needed for AC
reporting and evaluation of the CTT. The Administrative Core will produce and submit the Annual Progress
Report for the NIH IDeA program; maintain a web presence to connect the CTT with the USC academic units,
other IDeA programs/centers inside and outside the state, the NIH IDeA program, and the scientific
community. 2) To administer the Pilot Project program supporting Targeted Therapeutics research. The Pilot
Project program will provide competitive funding for Targeted Therapeutics research projects each year, aimed
at generating preliminary data leading to grant applications. In addition to conducting the competition for Pilot
Projects, the administrative core will implement specific strategies to promote diversity and inclusion and will
identify and promote priority scientific areas for support through the Pilot Project program and arranging
collaborations. The administrative core, together with the AC, will select Pilot Projects for funding and monitor
their productivity and impact on the career development of Pilot Project Leaders (PPL). 3). To foster the growth
and expansion of Targeted Therapeutics research at the University by organizing and managing monthly CTT
meetings, biannual meetings with the AC and annual symposia, as well as invited seminars. The
Administrative Core will also mediate the monitoring of the pilot research projects and the review of drafts of
grant proposals and manuscripts, coordinate opportunities for brainstorming and the generation of ideas, and
identify priority scientific areas for future CTT growth. The Administrative Core will support the submission of
team-based grant proposals and grow a research environment conducive to the development of young
scientists and to acceleration of discoveries with inherent translational applicability. 4). To perform the
evaluation of the CTT Program by utilizing a series of milestones and metrical indicators that have been
developed. The administrative team will be responsible for conducting the evaluation process, assessing it
against the established indicators and taking corrective actions if needed. Reports on the evaluation outcomes
will be provided to the AC to receive feedback and recommendations for the appropriate course of action."
10933193,"This proposal aims to continue to improve the quality and breadth of predoctoral immunology training at
Dartmouth. It builds upon and improves a continually funded T32 program that has been successfully training
the next generation of immunologists for thirty years. The scientific focus is to better understand the immune
system in health and disease and to leverage these findings to develop better therapies for an array of different
conditions where the immune response is central to pathogenesis. Our goal is to provide a cutting-edge program
to train the best graduate students to conduct rigorous and ethical research in the field of immunology. Trainees
will be mentored to become productive researchers who are experts in their fields and also very well-informed
about immunology as whole. Faculty trainers are drawn from a wide variety of areas within immunology. The
program can therefore offer interdisciplinary training that includes the interfaces between immunology and
infectious disease, cancer, mucosal homeostasis, pulmonary disease, autoimmunity and systems biology. In
addition to training in the design, implementation, reproducibility and interpretation of research projects, the
program teaches students how to effectively present their research in seminar presentations and in written
formats such as grant proposals. Major strengths of the program include: (i) the strength of the research
programs of the training faculty. Faculty research program represent a broad array of disciplines within
immunology, many of which span different fields and involve interdisciplinary collaborations with different labs
both within Dartmouth and at other institutions. The relatively small size of Dartmouth laboratories also leads to
very close interactions between faculty and trainees, creating an ideal learning environment. (ii) Students
appointed to the training program enter through two very strong umbrella graduate programs, the Molecular and
Cellular Biology program and the Quantitative Biological Sciences program. Graduate education is coordinated
by the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, that offers a wealth of professional development
activities for students, supplemented by activities by training program trainers, to help them with their future
careers. (iii) The Geisel School of Medicine and Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth offer state-of-the-
art facilities for laboratory research, computational and statistical resources, an AAALAC approved animal facility
and core facilities for genomics and bioinformatics. In this competitive renewal we detail new training programs
that have been added during the last grant period and new initiatives we propose adding to the training program.
The Dartmouth Immunology Program has had outstanding track record of success in training young
immunologists over the past thirty years, and trainees populate many of the most prominent immunology
laboratories throughout the world. We will augment this success in the current proposal and train scientists who
will become the future of immunology research."
10935472,"Overall – Abstract
This is the competitive renewal for year 30-34 of the UNC Breast Cancer SPORE. SPORE goals and aims
have been reinvigorated every five years with advice from a robust advocate group and an insightful series of
external and internal advisors. However, the emphasis on racial, ethnic, and lower socioeconomic status (SES)
breast cancer disparities, genomic technology and analytic capacity, subtyping/biomarker research and
therapeutic resistance have been consistent, as has the recruitment and mentoring of junior faculty. Career
development has returned dividends, with multiple SPORE leaders being previous recipients of CEP funds.
One constant since 1992 is a biospecimen, epidemiologic, and clinical data-rich population-based Carolina
Breast Cancer Study (CBCS). CBCS Phase 3 (3,000 new cases, 2008-2013) has collected ten years of
follow-up; CBCS 4 will recruit an additional 3,000 new cases, again oversampling Black (50% of study
population) and younger (50% of study) women, who are typically understudied in genomic and health services
research. CBCS has made seminal contributions to our understanding of Triple Negative Breast Cancer
(TNBC) and other subtypes in Black and White populations with 230+ papers published (47 from this cycle),
many high impact and heavily cited. Understanding and addressing racial disparities in breast cancer is a
longstanding emphasis of this SPORE, and CBCS in particular, which will focus on a cells-to-society model
wherein tumor biology and immune response are part of a complex system that includes differences in health
care access and social environments. All 4 projects, which share a focus on TNBC that disproportionately
afflicts Black and young women, will contribute to understanding across this spectrum.
Continued institutional investment, averaging $2-$2.5M yearly, allows the renewed SPORE to: i) Incorporate
new technologies and methods; ii) Develop infrastructure for population and translational research; and iii)
Support junior and mid-level faculty from the population, basic, and clinical sciences. In the past 5 years the
CEP supported 17 new faculty (12 women and 8 URM individuals) who successfully competed for foundation,
cooperative group, and NCI funding. DRP funded multiple collaborative projects (two are among the 4 Projects
in this application). With EAB, Advocate, and Executive Committee input, the MPIs Perou and Carey selected
four Projects, focusing on disparities, biomarkers, immune-based therapeutics and TNBC therapeutic
resistance: Project #1 – Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS): Linking Tumor Biology to Social Determinants
(Troester PhD, and Reeder-Hayes MD, MBA MSc), Project #2 – Determinants of Response and Resistance to
DNA-Damaging Radiation Plus Immunotherapy Combinations in TNBC (Gupta MD, PhD, and Vincent MD),
Project #3 – Development of Novel Therapies and Biomarkers for TNBC (Perou PhD, and Carey MD, ScM),
Project #4 – Activity of CAR-T Cell Therapy for Patients with Metastatic TNBC (Dotti PhD, Serody MD, and
Dees MD, ScM)."
10943799,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tumor metastasis is responsible for the vast majority of deaths from epithelial cancers, including breast
cancer. Understanding how cancer cells spread to distant sites, persist as dormant disseminated tumor cells
(DTCs), and eventually recur is essential to improving the treatment of this disease. The long-term goal of my
research group is to identify pathways that regulate these processes to enable the development of therapies that
can prevent or treat metastatic recurrences.
 We recently identified a role for the antioxidant stress response transcription factor NRF2 in promoting
the survival and local recurrence of mammary tumors following targeted therapy. We found that NRF2 is
activated following diverse targeted therapies as a consequence of metabolic and oxidative stress. NRF2
remains constitutively activated in recurrent tumors, where it functions to promote recurrence through regulating
redox homeostasis and nucleotide metabolism.
 While these results identify a function for NRF2 in local recurrence, a role for NRF2 in promoting
metastatic dissemination remains relatively unexplored. Emerging evidence suggests that metastatic
dissemination is associated with metabolic and oxidative stress. Consistent with this, we recently found that the
NRF2 transcriptional program is elevated in metastatic tumors from patients with breast cancer. However, a
thorough understanding of NRF2 regulation during metastatic dissemination, and how NRF2 activation
functionally affects metastasis, remains unknown.
 This proposal will build on this work to define the regulation and function of NRF2 during metastasis in
breast cancer. In new preliminary data, we found that NRF2 suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling in breast
cancer. Consistent with this, NRF2 knockdown leads to infiltration of immune cells into the tumor
microenvironment. Based upon these findings, the central hypothesis for this proposal is that NRF2
promotes breast cancer progression by inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling between cancer cells and
the tumor immune microenvironment. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will define the mechanism and function of NRF2 regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. In Aim 2, we
will determine the role of NRF2 suppression of inflammatory signaling in promoting the outgrowth of
disseminated tumor cells. In Aim 3 we will test whether targeting metabolic pathways can prevent the growth of
NRF2-high tumors. Our work will reveal new information on how NRF2 functions to regulate tumor progression
and may uncover novel therapeutic opportunities to prevent metastatic recurrence."
10943838,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a global health challenge and affects around 463 million people worldwide. For up to 5% of these
individuals their diabetes is due to a defect in a single gene. These monogenic varieties of diabetes provide
important opportunities for precision medicine altering the first line treatment for patients, providing information
on prognosis and risk for family members. Our inability to interpret DNA sequence variation results in uncertainty
regarding the impact of a DNA change on protein function leading to variants of unknown significance (VUS)
which are a barrier to precision medicine. A proposed solution is the deployment of multi-variant assays of
effects (MAVES) which generate a comprehensive catalogue of the effect of DNA sequence on protein function
which can then aid clinical variant interpretation and provide important information on protein structure and
function. The choice of assay and its alignment with gold-standard low throughput approaches is paramount for
accurate variant interpretation.
The overarching aim of our research program is to generate comprehensive maps of variant effects for
genes involved in monogenic diabetes to deliver precision diagnostics to enable precision medicine.
We will capitalize on our expertise in gold-standard assays for variant characterization in monogenic diabetes
genes and alignment with the Clin Gen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel. We will deploy state-of-the-art
microfluidic platforms and use authentic human cell models coupled to gene and disease relevant assays to
determine the effects of all missense variants which can be generated by a single nucleotide substitution for the
two most common causes of monogenic diabetes, defects in the key glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) and
the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A). We will achieve this by [1] Quantitatively
characterizing the `functional enzymatic signatures' across 1000s of GCK variants using High-
Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Kinetics (HI-MEK); [2] Determining HNF1A transcription factor function at
scale using Simultaneous Transcription factor Affinity Measurements via Microfluidic Protein Arrays (STAMMP)
to determine effects on DNA binding and coupling this with a high-throughput pooled screen for insulin secretion
in human beta cells and; [3] working with international leaders in monogenic diabetes to Integrate our variant
maps into clinical diagnostics through variant curation & the developing improved prediction models.
Outcome: We will deliver a roadmap for design, validation, and implementation of MAVES to assess the impact
of protein coding variants in any medically actionable gene relevant to diabetes risk."
10941885,"Project Summary
The human body has ~37 trillion cells and over 200 different cell types. Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC1,
PRC2) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) are evolutionarily conserved chromatin modifier enzymes that
are essential for establishing and maintaining cellular identity by silencing lineage-inappropriate genes during
embryonic development and cellular differentiation. PRC1, PRC2, and DNMT1 are also key enzymes in cardiac
development, and defective activity of these enzymes is a hallmark of cardiac diseases and loss of cell identity
in various cancers and tumors. Polycomb-mediated gene silencing involves the coordinated activity of PRC1
and PRC2 through histone post-translational modifications. PRC1 is a histone E3 ligase that catalyzes the mono-
ubiquitination of H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) on nucleosomes, which aids in the recruitment and activation
of PRC2 for the trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K27me3) leading to gene silencing. Similar crosstalk between
trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and mono-ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 18 and 23
(H3K18K23ub2) is thought to be responsible for the recruitment and activation of DNMT1 at replication forks for
the maintenance of DNA methylation. The major research goal in the lab over the next five years is to uncover
the mechanistic basis for the recruitment and activation of PRC1 and DNMT1 on chromatin.
We will utilize an integrated approach combining cryo-electron microscopy, chemical biology, mass
spectrometry, and biochemical assays to (a) uncover the mechanistic basis for how DNA and histone post-
translational modifications activate PRC1 and DNMT1 on chromatin and (b) design and develop new inhibitor
and activator candidates that can target specific regions of PRC2 that are important for chromatin interactions
and enzymatic activity. We will use biochemical mutational and activity assays to validate our results from the
structural studies. We will also biochemically characterize how known disease-causing mutations lead to defects
in the enzymatic activity of PRC1 and DNMT1 on chromatin.
The vision of our research program is to provide novel structural and mechanistic insights into the role played by
chromatin in activating gene-silencing enzymes such as PRC1, PRC2, and DNMT1. We envisage that such
insights will aid in developing small molecule effectors targeting these enzymes in malignancies such as solid
tumors, which have so far lacked targeted treatments. One example of this structural biology approach is our
proposed work on developing effector molecules targeting specific regions of PRC2 in this proposal."
10943814,"Project Summary
We currently lack effective therapies for treating chronic infections because most antibiotics were screened for
their ability to kill fast-growing, planktonic bacteria. In chronic infections, bacteria are difficult to eradicate
because they grow slowly and form biofilms; these physiologies facilitate antibiotic tolerance and resistance to
host immune defenses. Our research aims to address this challenge by investigating how the host nutrient
environment drives bacteria to adopt these recalcitrant states. Our preliminary studies have identified nutrient
availability as a key regulator of the slow growth and biofilm lifestyles, highlighting bacterial metabolism and the
host nutrient environment as inroads for controlling these difficult-to-treat states. This research program will
build from these findings to determine how nutrient cues direct the physiologies of gram-positive anaerobic
cocci (GPAC). GPAC are a diverse group of obligate anaerobic bacteria; their physiologies are distinct from
well-studied biofilm-forming bacteria, providing an opportunity to uncover new mechanisms for counteracting
antibiotic tolerance and disrupting biofilms. GPAC are prevalent members of the human microbiota and
understudied agents of chronic infections. In this proposal, we will determine how the nutrient environment
supports or limits GPAC metabolism, investigating how this relationship underpins antibiotic treatment failure.
We will also identify how specific nutrient cues regulate biofilm formation or dispersal, and further explore how
biofilm regulation has diverged within an important GPAC lineage. Our work integrates a range of techniques
to pursue mechanistic studies of GPAC physiology, including quantitative microscopy, experimental evolution,
and genetic and omics approaches. We have also developed crucial new tools for studying these non-model
bacteria, including genetic manipulation, defined media for manipulating the nutrient environment, and the
establishment of an ex vivo wound tissue growth medium to recapitulate the host nutrient environment. In
completing these projects, we will reveal how the host nutrient environment regulates bacterial physiologies
that enable chronic colonization and recalcitrance to antibiotic therapies. Studying physiologically relevant
bacterial states will inspire new therapeutic approaches for combatting chronic infections."

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons are essential for associative learning of reward and aversion-
related cues, updating learned associations by prediction errors, as well as supporting a value of rewarding
and aversive outcomes. While it is well established that VTA dopamine neurons show heterogenous signaling
patterns related to these motivationally-relevant events, as well as express diverse molecular characteristics,
our understanding of how dopaminergic molecular heterogeneity contributes to VTA dopamine neuron
functions are unclear. A primary distinction between subtypes of VTA dopamine neurons is whether they
release dopamine alone or co-release dopamine with glutamate. We propose to test the hypothesis that VTA
dopamine neuron signaling patterns and roles in motivated behavior are genetically-determined by whether
they co-release dopamine with glutamate or they release dopamine without glutamate. In AIM 1, we will
determine the neuronal activity signaling patterns of VTA glutamate-dopamine co-releasing neurons,
nonglutamate-dopamine neurons, or glutamate-only neurons that do not co-release GABA or dopamine, in a
variety of reward and aversion-based motivated behavior tasks involving associative learning, outcome
prediction and errors, and outcome values. In AIM 2, we will causally determine the roles of these same
neurons in reward and aversion-based motivated behavior tasks involving associative learning, outcome
prediction, reward, and aversion. Finally in AIM 3, we will causally determine the roles of dopamine and/or
glutamate release from these distinct VTA neuronal phenotypes in reward and aversion-based tasks involving
associative and nonassociative learning as well as other motivationally-relevant behaviors. Together these
studies will comprehensively identify how the molecular heterogeneity of the midbrain dopamine system
contributes to associative learning and motivated behaviors."

African Americans have both the highest incidence and mortality of lung cancer compared to any
other racial/ethnic group. A possible explanation for this disparity is that African Americans (AA)
may be less likely to utilize preventative screenings such as Low-dose computed tomography
(LDCT), which has the potential to encourage smokers to quit smoking successfully. In 2021, the
USPSTF expanded their lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendations to include individuals
ages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year history, increasing the number of eligible U.S.
adults. While the expanded criteria are expected to increase the number of high-risk individuals
eligible for screening and reduce lung cancer mortality, the impact on racial and ethnic minorities,
including African Americans, has shown mixed findings. This is problematic as previous research
has found that African Americans may have different quit behaviors than whites. While use of
LCS as a teachable moment for tobacco cessation is important, currently, there is no well-
integrated, comprehensive, culturally relevant community-engaged, sustainable program. Still, it
is not clear whether the synergy effect of smoking cessation and LDCT LCS intervention was
observed in both quitting behaviors and LDCT uptake among African-American smokers. To
address this urgent public health concern, this study aims to reduce disparities and the burden of
lung cancer among AA smokers by supporting a Multiple-level intervention integrating lung cancer
screening and smoking cessation(MILS), followed the NIH DEIA strategies using multilevel
interventions that impact determinants of health and address health disparities at appropriate time
points across the life course. Aim 1) Investigate smokers' and providers' attitudes, knowledge,
and experiences with the expanded 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations. Aim 2) Compare the
effectiveness of a MILS vs. usual care on the biochemically-validated 7-day point-prevalence
tobacco abstinence rates, LDCT uptake, nicotine dependence and stage of change was
assessed. Aim 3) Explore barriers and facilitators that influence primary outcomes at the
community, provider, and individual levels for the improvement of a multilevel intervention. To
date, no study has evaluated the synergy effect of smoking cessation intervention and LDCT LCS
in AA populations with multilevel strategies. We will move the field forward by providing effective,
scalable interventions to improve both smoking cessation and LDCT lung cancer screening
adherence to reduce health disparities promised by large clinical trials that motivated screening
guidelines. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to
improve lung cancer screening rates among minorities."

CAR T cell therapies have been revolutionary for patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies;
however, the relapse rates are unacceptably high, with ~60% of patients relapsing with leukemia and lymphoma,
and for multiple myeloma (MM), where more follow up is needed, relapse is likely even higher. Notably, adult
patients rarely develop long-term immunologic memory or functional long-term persistence of CAR T cells, with
relapse predictably often occurring after the loss of functional adoptive anti-tumor immunity. One solution to
short-lived adoptive immunity is to genetically modify hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with the transgene for the
CAR. This would result in the CAR being expressed across hematopoiesis long-term. However, as cytokine
release syndrome (CRS) is mediated by T and myeloid cells, this long-term pan-hematopoietic expression would
put patients at great risk for cytokine-mediated or other toxicity. We propose an alternative concept, where
HSCs are stably integrated with DNA encoding the CAR; however, transcription is only initiated once
cells have differentiated into NK cells to generate safe and efficacious “HSC CAR-NK factories”.
We selected NK cells as the risk of CRS is minimal, there is no need for thymic differentiation, and they have a
proven track record of CAR-mediated killing; however, the defining limitation of CAR-NK cell therapies has been
persistence, which this approach is designed to address via long-term continuous renewal. We hypothesize that
including NK-specific regulatory elements controlling CAR transgene expression will generate NK-specific, highly
efficacious long-term anti-cancer immunity.
In preliminary data, we demonstrated that patient HSC-based CAR transduction and transplantation in the setting
of murine models that generate minimal T cells can be highly active in preventing tumor growth; NK cells
generated this way and isolated ex vivo maintain cytolytic anti-tumor function through the CAR. We further
identified, via analysis of comparative ATAC-seq data, a library of NK-specific regulatory elements and found a
lead assembly of these regulatory elements that reproducibly led to CAR expression highly enriched in NK cells;
a finding that we validated in different in vivo HSC transplant/NK differentiation models using patient HSCs.
Here, we will investigate if a naturally occurring NK-specific regulatory element assembly, (Aim 1) can be
leveraged to develop a model HSC-based persistent adoptive cellular therapy platform for anti-tumor immunity,
and (Aim 2) seek to understand the biology and maximize the efficacy of a “HSC CAR-NK cell factory” approach.
Specifically, we will use three separate in vivo models that allow for NK development post-huHSC
transplantation."

Secondary lymphedema poses a significant financial and health burden afflicting 1 in 1000
Americans, resulting in a debilitating and incurable swelling and fibrosis in the affected extremity
or tissue. The prevailing hypothesis for the pathogenesis of secondary lymphedema posits a
role for lymphatic collecting vessel (cLV) pump failure in response to elevated lymphatic
pressures observed in LE patients, and points to a deficit in lymphatic muscle cell (LMC)
function. The process by which LMCs regulate pressure-dependent pacemaking, contractility,
and transcriptional regulation are critically dependent on inositol triphosphate receptor 1
(IP3R1)-dependent Ca2+ oscillations, although the mechanisms that sustain LMC Ca2+
homeostasis remain unexplored. The central goal of this proposal is to address this knowledge
gap and determine how LMC Ca2+ dynamics regulate contractile activity and transcriptional
adaptation to ensure fluid transport homeostasis. The Ca2+ source that refills the store has been
assumed to be only voltage-gated L-type channels, however our preliminary studies identified
the novel expression of the SR Ca2+ sensor proteins Stim1 and Stim2 as well as the plasma
membrane (PM) Ca2+ channels Orai1 and Orai3 in healthy LMCs, which are the critical
components of store operated Ca2+entry (SOCE). Our preliminary findings also show functional
SOCE in healthy LMCs in response to store depletion and that LMC Ca2+ oscillations are lost
when SOCE is inhibited. Intriguingly, robust SOCE activation by excessive vasocontractile
agonist signaling or SR Ca2+ leak drives cLVs into a contractile rigor and thus may contribute to
lymphatic dysfunction. This led us to hypothesize that SOCE is a key modulator of lymphatic
muscle cell function. We proposed the following aims to determine the role of SOCE in the
regulation of lymphatic contractility and transcriptional regulation. Specific Aim1: Assess SR-PM
junction formation and SOCE activity in LMCs. Specific Aim2: Determine the contribution of
SOCE to pressure-dependent LMC pacemaking and contractility. Specific Aim3: Investigate the
mechanisms by which IP3R1- Ca2+ oscillations and SOCE regulate LMC contractile protein
expression through Ca2+-dependent transcription factor activation such as nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFATs). This project will provide novel information about the role of SOCE as
a fundamental Ca2+ homeostatic mechanism in LMCs and the degree to which SOCE is
required for acute and chronic cLV adaptation to pressure. These results will identify novel
targets for pharmacological intervention in LE patients and may shed light on cLV contractile
dysfunction reported in obesity, diabetes, and hypertension."

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a widespread mucosal infection caused predominantly
by the commensal fungus Candida albicans. VVC is a global health concern due to its
high prevalence in immunocompetent women (>75% incidence). Although not fatal,
approximately 15% of women experience VVC recurrently, resulting in serious impacts
on quality of life and significant cost burden. There are no licensed vaccines to any
fungal pathogens. While much has been learned about immunity to C. albicans in other
sites (mouth, gut, skin), our understanding of immunity at the vaginal mucosa is
comparatively limited. Control of C. albicans in mouth and skin unquestionably requires
Th17 cells/IL-17, but the role of the Th17 pathway in VVC is controversial. Women with
HIV/AIDS or rare Th17/IL-17 receptor genetic deficiencies are not thought to have
abnormal incidences of VVC, yet Th17 signatures are upregulated in VVC, and VVC is a
statistically significant adverse event associated with IL-17 or other anti-cytokine
blockade. Here we show that multiple cytokines in the Th17 axis act in concert to
promote immunity to VVC, and we will probe the essential correlates that drive immunity
in this mucosal setting from both the host and the fungal side."

The Systems Approaches to Cancer Biology (SACB) meeting aims to bring together scientific leaders and
early-stage investigators in Cancer Systems Biology to build and foster a thriving and collaborative field
through sharing scientific advances. Started as a grassroots effort from early-stage Cancer Systems Biology
investigators, the first SACB meeting was held in 2016 and is held every other year. SACB has previously
been co-sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Association for Cancer Systems Biologists
(ACSB). The meeting is solely focused on research topics that address cancer as inherently complex, with
spatial, temporal, and interpatient heterogeneity, and with multifactorial causes and consequences that cannot
be understood without integrating diverse approaches from a combination of traditional scientific disciplines.
The SACB meeting consists of seven plenary sessions, poster sessions, and many opportunities for early-
stage investigators to network and gain mentorship from more senior investigators, including “meet the PI”
lunches and happy hours. SACB plenary sessions focus on many aspects of cancer biology and cover a
diversity of computational/mathematical modeling approaches. This problem-domain-focused programming is
particularly conducive to the synthesis of new ideas and collaborations among attendees. Given the history of
this meeting, there is a strong emphasis on the development and fostering of early-stage investigators, which
includes at least half of the oral presentations being given by trainees and addressing topics of interest to
early-stage investigators through special topic sessions. Another focus of the meeting is to grow the Cancer
Systems Biology community, which we will accomplish by targeting underserved research communities,
reaching out to researchers in complementary topic areas, such as computer science or engineering, as well
as funding support for investigators with additional family needs. The SACB Scholars program, initiated in
2022, will support at least 8 undergraduate and/or graduate trainees from under-represented groups in
biomedical research to attend the SACB 2024 meeting. This program in 2022 was highly successful and is
aimed at providing training and networking opportunities to individuals that might not be able to gain these
experiences otherwise. SACB has successfully helped to advance the careers of many early-stage
investigators and brings together like-minded investigators to share research findings. SACB 2024 will maintain
the hybrid meeting format to both in-person and virtual meeting options. This will provide a venue for SACB to
reach colleagues across the world and still be able to provide the intimate environment needed to foster
Cancer Systems Biology research into the future."
10941975,"Abstract
The α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) mediates the signaling of many hormones, autocrine/paracrine
factors, and neurotransmitters. Gsα and its gene, the GNAS complex locus, are central to many human disorders
with perturbed hormone actions and skeletal development. A distinctive way Gsα signaling is regulated involves
the control of allelic Gsα expression. While Gsα is produced from both parental GNAS alleles in most cells,
including growth plate chondrocytes and osteoblasts, it is derived predominantly from the maternal allele in
specific cells/tissues, most prominently renal proximal tubules and thyroid cells. This monoallelic expression
plays a crucial role in patients with maternal loss-of-function GNAS mutations, causing severe Gsα deficiency
and impaired hormone signaling in those tissues already with monoallelic expression, most prominently affecting
parathyroid hormone (PTH) actions, particularly in the renal proximal tubule, and thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH) action in the thyroid. Patients with this disorder, pseudohypoparathyroidism type-1A (PHP1A), also show
additional phenotypes, including brachydactyly and short stature due, at least partly, to Gsα haploinsufficiency
in tissues with normally biallelic Gsα expression. Thus, allelic expression of Gsα critically regulates Gsα signaling
in specific tissues and dictates the phenotypes associated with GNAS mutations. To better understand the
regulation of Gsα-mediated hormone signaling and to develop curative treatments for these diseases, an
improved knowledge of the mechanisms governing allelic Gsα expression is required. We focus on PHP1B, a
pseudohypoparathyroidism subtype characterized by PTH and TSH resistance without the additional
phenotypes in PHP1A. GNAS is a methylated gene, and all patients with PHP1B show maternal hypomethylation
in the GNAS exon A/B differentially methylated region (DMR) adjacent to Gsα-coding exons, suggesting that the
A/B DMR is involved in allelic Gsα expression. However, the role of A/B methylation and the underlying
mechanisms have remained poorly understood. We have recently developed human embryonic stem cell models
of PHP1B by introducing the genetic deletions identified in patients into the GNAS locus. We will employ these
unique tools, as well as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from healthy and PHP1B patients, to
elucidate the mechanisms by which GNAS methylation regulates allelic Gsα expression. Based on our recently
published findings, we hypothesize that exon A/B methylation, controlled by the upstream NESP55 transcription
in the early embryo, is crucial for allelic Gsα expression and hormone signaling in specific differentiated tissues.
Aim 1 will determine whether inducing NESP55 transcription can increase A/B methylation in cis to rescue Gsα
deficiency due to different GNAS defects. Aim 2 will determine whether the methylation of the GNAS exon A/B
DMR is needed for Gsα expression and hormone signaling in a tissue-specific manner. Our study will establish
the role of GNAS methylation in regulating Gsα expression and signaling in specific tissues and contribute to a
deeper understanding of the disease mechanisms responsible for end-organ resistance to PTH and TSH."
10942150,"Nocturnin (NOCT) is a NADP(H) phosphatase with highly rhythmic expression peaking in the early dark
phase (ZT12) in most tissues in mice. Noct-/- (Noct-KO) mice exhibit a range of tissue-specific phenotypes, but
notably are resistant to diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis on a high-fat diet. Despite this protection from
obesity and fat accumulation in the liver, these mice do not eat less and are not more active, but instead have
alterations in energy expenditure that are not well understood. Given the widespread role of NADP(H) as an
essential cofactor in numerous metabolic reactions, it is likely that NOCT has distinct tissue-specific effects,
making it difficult to understand NOCT’s role in metabolism using a global KO model. Therefore, this proposal
will use adipose-, liver-, muscle-, and intestine-specific conditional Noct-KO (cKO) mice, generated via the Cre-
loxP system, to study NOCT’s role in metabolism. Aim 1 will determine if loss of NOCT in one tissue is
responsible for the body weight phenotype. In this aim, both male and female cKO and control mice will be
subjected to a high-fat diet for twenty weeks. Body weight and food intake will be recorded on a weekly basis,
energy expenditure will be measured using metabolic cages and body composition measurements will be taken
to determine differences in fat and lean mass. At the end of the study, plasma, adipose, liver, muscle, and
intestinal tissues will be collected from each cKO line and their respective controls at two time points (ZT2 and
ZT14) further analyses including measurement of plasma lipoproteins and plasma adipokine levels. Histology
will also be done to define any gross morphological differences caused by loss of NOCT. Aim 2 will examine
the gene expression changes in global Noct-KO and cKO mice. We will determine how the transcriptome
of each of the four tissues change over the circadian day in the global Noct-KO when fed HFD for 20 weeks and
will compare this to the transcriptome of each of the four individual tissues in the cKOs to assess the relative
contribution of local NOCT activity on gene expression. In Aim 3 we will examine the molecular mechanisms
that result in the protection of hepatic steatosis in the global Noct-KO and will determine whether this
liver-specific phenotype is the result of loss of NOCT in the liver or requires contributions from other
tissues. The experiments outlined in this proposal will define how tissue-specific loss of NOCT, and thus how
tissue-specific increases in NADP(H) levels, impact metabolism. More specifically, this proposal will aid in
understanding how loss of NOCT protects against diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis, which, in turn, can
aid in the development of treatments for obesity and obesity-related diseases."
10942153,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is growing global threat, especially among younger adults. Impaired differentiation
is a critical mechanism by which CRC cells unlock cell state plasticity; it enables neoplastic cells to persist rather
than turnover in the rapidly renewing intestinal epithelium and eventually acquire malignant features. The
molecular underpinnings of impaired differentiation are complex and challenging to unravel. Recent studies from
our group spotlight the transcription factor (TF) SOX9 as a pivotal functional mediator of impaired differentiation
in CRC. Disrupting SOX9 induced differentiation and reduced tumor burden in several CRC models, sparking
deeper inquiry. Our preliminary data support a compelling link between aberrant SOX9 activity and reactivation
of fetal intestinal genes in mouse and human models of CRC. Based on these findings, our overall hypothesis
is that SOX9 impairs differentiation by facilitating developmental reprogramming in CRC. To investigate this
hypothesis, we have developed powerful in vitro and in vivo systems to address two Specific Aims.
 In Aim 1, we will apply unbiased topic modeling analyses to paired singe cell RNA and ATAC sequencing
data from genetically engineered mice to nominate regulators of fetal reprogramming in neoplastic cells (1A). By
integrating mRNA, open chromatin, and TF binding profiles from our mouse models and patient-derived
organoids, we will investigate if SOX9 directly regulates fetal genes via pioneer activity (1B). We will determine
if SOX9 is required for fetal gene reactivation in vivo through histopathology and single cell characterization of a
genetic mouse model (1C). Finally, we will leverage a newly engineered cellular platform that enables drug-
induced rapid degradation of endogenous SOX9 (dTAG system) to study its role in chromatin access, histone
mark deposition, and fetal gene expression (1D).
 We observed new chromatin accessibility at TACSTD2 and aberrant expression of its protein product TROP2,
a fetal glycoprotein, in human CRC. Our preliminary data also indicate that SOX9 directly regulates transcription
of TACSTD2. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that TROP2 is a functional component of the SOX9-mediated
differentiation block in CRC by evaluating its necessity (2A) and sufficiency (2B). Beyond TROP2, we will
systematically evaluate short-listed developmental factors using a custom engineered endogenous
differentiation reporter system, asking whether each candidate is required for impaired differentiation in a positive
selection genetic screen (2C). Through the functional investigation of TROP2, we will strengthen a key link
between SOX9 and developmental reprogramming.
 Overall, armed with robust model systems, rigorous scientific methods, and a hypothesis-driven approach,
our proposal will define basic mechanisms by which aberrant SOX9 activity promotes CRC. By offering deeper
insights into impaired differentiation and aberrant cell state plasticity, we aim to inspire new strategies for next-
generation CRC therapeutics."
10942500,"The study of state-level Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) policies and their impact on health
outcomes is hindered by the absence of a comprehensive, longitudinal database. The existing fragmented and
incomplete data sources limit the field's ability to produce robust research. This project aims to address this
critical gap by creating, optimizing, and disseminating a comprehensive, open-access data dashboard of state
SRH policies spanning from 1973 to 2028 that prioritizes rigorous legal expertise and accessibility for users.
This period crucially captures both historical and contemporary policy changes, starting in 1973 to coincide
with the Roe v. Wade ruling capturing a full six legislative years after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, a
crucial contemporary period of SRH policymaking likely to shape SRH and MCH outcomes for years to come.
Our overarching goal is to facilitate rigorous research on the associations and causal pathways between state
SRH policies and health outcomes. Aim 1 will compile comprehensive state SRH policy data by collecting and
aggregating approximately 90 state-level policies related to the three key domains of abortion, contraception,
and sex education in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Rigorous policy surveillance methodology will
be employed to systematically collect and code relevant statutes, regulations, executive orders, case law, and
attorney general opinions. Furthermore, we will engage public health and social science researchers in a
human-centered design process to elicit data requirements and create consistent variables that balance
accuracy with accessibility. Aim 2 seeks to enhance the usability of the data by building a user-friendly
dashboard. This will involve iterative user experience design to optimize functionality and incorporate feedback
from researchers. State-of-the-art data science techniques will be used to create a platform that houses ready-
to-use SRH policy data files and offers multi-policy visualization capabilities. This will enable researchers to
efficiently explore geographic and temporal patterns and policy co-existence. Aim 3 focuses on the
dissemination of the dashboard. We will showcase its utility through peer-reviewed studies that
comprehensively document the history and variability of state policy on abortion, contraception, and sex
education while illustrating its potential uses in future research. We will develop and publish targeted
methodological guidance to facilitate rigorous policy data analysis and support users’ production of high-quality
research. Given the evolving socio-legal landscape with active revisions to SRH policies by states, our
dashboard will provide the definitive source of accurate, research-ready data. It will empower researchers to
conduct the rigorous analyses necessary for evidence-based policymaking, ultimately contributing to the
improvement of SRH and related maternal-child health outcomes in the United States."
10933383,"Each year, an estimated 1.7 million Americans suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI). The incidence of TBI
among veterans of the military may be as high as 30%, with blast injury from explosive devices causing the
overwhelming majority of TBIs in combat settings. An association between non-severe (i.e., mild or moderate)
mTBI and substance abuse has been demonstrated in numerous epidemiological studies. Therefore, veterans
of the military that have experienced TBI during deployment or during non-deployed and civilian life may be at
higher risk for drug abuse disorders than people that have not experienced TBI. However, despite extensive
evidence of increased substance abuse disorder following non-severe TBI, little is known about how traumatic
brain injury changes brain structure and function to make somebody more susceptible to drug abuse. Thus, there
is a great deal of inconsistency in clinical treatments prescribed to non-severe TBI sufferers that can include no
drug treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or even opioids. The long-term consequences for millions
of veterans remains unknown.
Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) in humans have
revealed subtle damage to brain tissues following mTBI, in which specific brain regions seem to be particularly
vulnerable to injury. In our published data, an experimental model of blast mTBI in rodents led to an enduring
inflammatory response that was evident in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the brain, which was evident
using advanced MRI techniques and pathological investigation. There is emerging evidence of a link between
these types of inflammatory responses in the brain and drug abuse behavior. In fact, recent research has
indicated that the use of opioids, which are commonly prescribed for TBI, initiate similar inflammatory responses.
Therefore, our hypothesis is that drug intake and/or drug abuse relapse would be more likely following mTBI.
Given that opioids are commonly administered to mTBI patients in emergency departments, combined with the
fact that over 13 million Americans misused prescription pain killers or used heroin in 2016, this could lead to a
significant public health issue with mTBI patients that are treated with opioids suffering from possible life-long
issues with drug dependency.
This study will explore the relationship between mTBI and substance abuse disorder using a laboratory model,
wherein rodents will be exposed to blast mTBI and post-injury opioid self-administration to model individual drug
treatment following injury. After removal of opioids, rodents will later be exposed again to opioid self-
administration to identify relapse behaviors and addiction liability. The effects of pharmacological treatment on
addiction liability will also be defined. The mechanisms for these changes in the brain following mTBI and opioid
exposure will be determined using advanced MRI techniques and analysis of brain structure and chemistry.
Results of this study may help to define a correlation between mTBI and substance abuse disorders that can be
used by VA clinicians to better understand and treat veterans with drug addiction issues and history of TBI."
10943495,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Effective wound care is of paramount importance for individuals who have sustained burn injuries.
Wound healing is intricately associated with the sensations of itching and pain, which can significantly impact a
patient's quality of life. Following a burn injury, monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (LCs) are mobilized from
the bone marrow and recruited to the epidermal layer, potentially playing a pivotal role in the wound healing
process. Furthermore, the sensations of itch and pain are largely mediated by the free nerve endings of
nociceptive sensory neurons, often found in close proximity to resident LCs within the epidermis. However, our
comprehension of how LCs modulate wound healing, itching, and pain remains notably limited, primarily due to
the absence of established methods for selectively manipulating LC activity. Here, we hypothesize that
distinct subsets of LCs mediate wound healing, itch, and pain after burn injury. To test this hypothesis, we
have successfully applied optogenetics to directly control the activity of LCs by establishing a mouse line
that selectively expresses light-sensitive cation channels (ChR2) in LCs. We have also successfully
applied chemogenetics to directly control the activity of LCs by establishing a mouse line that selectively
expresses Gq- or Gi-biased Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (Gq- or Gi-
DREADD) in LCs. The long-term goal of this application is to advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms behind wound healing, itch, and pain after burn injury regulated by LC-sensory neuron
interaction and to offer innovative ways to treat these conditions by targeting LCs. Aim 1 will determine the
role of LC-sensory neuron interaction in wound healing using hematopoietic chimeras in which monocyte-
derived LCs selectively express Gq- or Gi-DREADD and transgenic mice in which sensory neurons
selectively express Gq- or Gi-DREADD. Aim 2 will determine the contribution of LCs to postburn itch and
pain using hematopoietic chimeras in which resident LCs selectively express ChR2 or Gi-DREADD, and in
vitro calcium imaging from LCs. Aim 3 will genetically define the heterogeneous population of LCs involved
in wound healing or nociception after burn injury using single-cell RNAseq. This proposal will help us to
understand completely new roles for LCs and how they may regulate wound healing and wound-related
itch and pain after burn injury. The successful completion of this proposal would provide a unique
approach to treating wound healing, wound-related itch, and pain after burn injury by targeting distinct
subsets of LCs."

The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Translational and Clinical Oncology (TCO) Research
Program (RP), established in July 2022, is led by C. Ola Landgren, MD, PhD, and Jaime R. Merchan, MD,
MMSc, and is composed of 39 members representing 14 departments. TCO’s goals are to advance clinical
and translational investigations leading to scientific discoveries and improved patient outcomes. In accordance
with Sylvester’s 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, the Center established TCO to drive collaborative scientific efforts
across the translational research continuum, enabling discoveries made in the other RPs to rapidly enter the
clinical setting and develop and test novel strategies to improve cancer therapies, overcome therapeutic
resistance, and implement more effective precision medicine approaches. Taking advantage of TCO members’
expertise in translational research, computational oncology, precision medicine, and the development of
investigator-initiated studies, TCO has two specific aims 1) identify and characterize novel targets, molecular
signatures, and biomarkers, to optimize clinical prediction, prognosis, and support new therapeutic
approaches; and 2) leverage discoveries made in TCO and other RPs to develop precision medicine-,
epigenetic-, and immunotherapy-based strategies to improve treatment outcomes. The availability of
numerous, excellent Sylvester Shared Resources facilitates multidimensional TCO research. TCO currently
has $4.9M in direct peer-reviewed funding, including $2.1M from the NCI, and $1.5M from 16 MPI grants.
During the current reporting period (6/1/2018-5/31/23), TCO members published 599 peer-reviewed cancer-
relevant papers: 21% were intra-programmatic, 33% were inter-programmatic, 69% involved collaboration with
external institutions, and 58% included investigators from other NCI-designated cancer centers. Notably, 40%
of TCO publications had an impact factor ≥10, demonstrating the quality of the studies and their recognition by
the scientific community. For example, collaborative TCO research provided insights into the 1) mechanisms of
resistance to non-covalent Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; 2)
the role of LMO2 on synthetic lethality to PARP inhibition in diffuse large B cell lymphomas 3) the role of
STING signaling in allogeneic stem cell transplant-induced GVHD; 4) identification of a novel role for
neutrophil-derived TNF in sustaining immunosuppression and stromal inflammation in pancreatic cancer; 5)
promising activity of the VEGF receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, axitinib plus pembrolizumab, in patients with
sarcoma (especially alveolar soft-part sarcoma); and 6) intensification of salvage radiotherapy combined with
short-term androgen deprivation therapy to improve outcomes in prostate cancer patients with biochemical
recurrence after prostatectomy. TCO plays a critical role in Sylvester’s mission to move discoveries from the
laboratory into Sylvester’s diverse patient population. The program utilizes team science approaches to drive
impactful, innovative, and catchment area-relevant translational and clinical research."

10932016,"ABSTRACT
Gonorrhea affects over 87 million people annually globally. In 2021, over 700,000 cases of gonorrhea were
reported to the CDC, a 118% increase since the historic low in the US in 2009. However, the true incidence of
cases annually in the US is estimated to be ~1.5 million. The spread of antimicrobial resistance has severely
limited treatment options – currently, ceftriaxone is the only approved first line of treatment. A safe and effective
therapeutic against gonorrhea is urgently needed. Gonococci (Ng) possess several mechanisms to evade killing
by complement (C’), including binding of factor H (FH) and C4b-binding protein (C4BP), key host inhibitors of
the alternative and classical pathway respectively. We showed previously that a chimeric protein comprising
human IgG3 Fc fused to FH domains 18-20 (containing a point mutation in domain 19 to prevent lysis of host
cells) (Fc3/FH*) killed Ng in a complement-dependent manner and reduced the duration and bacterial burden in
the mouse vaginal colonization model of gonorrhea. Ng can be broadly classified into two serovars based on the
sequence of the outer membrane protein (PorB): PorB1A and PorB1B. PorB1B strains account for 70-90% of
gonococcal infections. PorB1A strains are strongly associated with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) and
have caused serious sequelae including dermatitis, arthritis and endocarditis. Fc3/FH* is effective in vitro against
all PorB1B Ng strains tested, but it killed only 13% of tested PorB1A strains. We have developed and tested 2
additional C’ based immunotherapeutic molecules with better activities against PorB1A strains: FH (6-7)/Fc3 and
C4BP-IgM. We have shown that FH(6-7)/Fc3 binds to PorB1A strains and killed 60% of PorB1A strains tested.
C4BP/IgM binds 90% of PorB1A strains and killed 92% PorB1A Ng. The main goals of this project are to develop
a FH6-7 or a C4BP based-Fc fusion that is effective against PorB1A Ng to be part of a combination therapeutic
with Fc3/FH* in order to provide broad protection against both PorB1A and PorB1B strains. In Aim 1, we will
design and produce novel C4BP/Fc3 fusions with improved characteristics. Instead of using C4BP-IgM (which is
impractical to produce commercially), we will develop and produce multimeric C4BP/IgG fusion proteins in tobacco
plants . In Aim 2, we will evaluate in vitro efficacy of FH(6-7)/Fc3and C4BP/Fc3, alone and in combination with
Fc3/FH*. We will use a panel of 60 diverse Ng, consisting of 40 PorB1A and 20 PorB1B strains for testing. We
will test the binding of the fusion proteins to Ng by flow cytometry, and their bactericidal activity in the presence
of serum. The lead molecules will be evaluated under conditions mimicking those in the vagina and we will test
for any in vitro cytotoxicity. In Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of lead FH(6-7)/Fc3and C4BP-based/Fc3
immunotherapeutic molecules in human FH/C4BP transgenic mice. The murine Ng vaginal colonization model
is currently the only non-human model available to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of anti-gonococcal vaccines and
therapeutic molecules. We will evaluate the lead FH(6-7)/Fc3and C4BP/Fc3 alone and in combination with
Fc3/FH* against 1 PorB1A and 1PorB1B strains. Successful completion of the work in this proposal will identify
a lead gonococcal immunotherapy against multidrug-resistant Ng for further pre-clinical development."

Rigorous graduate academic and research programs enable quality training in (degrees and projected numbers): Industrial Hygiene (PhD-11, MS-12, MPH-18); Occupational and Environmental Medicine (MPH-17); Occupational and Environmental Health Nursing (PhD- 3, MS-0, MPH-13); Occupational Health Services Research and Policy (PhD-10); Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology (PhD-8, MPH-2); and Occupational Injury Prevention Research (PhD-9); while program duration varies, program expectations are: masters' (~2 years); PhD (~ 4 years) In addition, a major CE Program offers novel courses in-person and through distance learning (projected =18,000) to meet the needs of a diverse workforce."
10935869,"CORE 2 PROJECT SUMMARY
Key to this proposal is the inclusion of Core 2, which encompasses unified support for Bioinformatics,
Biostatistics, Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Computational Biology and the development of an integrated
analytical platform that will consolidate all the computational methods and tools developed or adapted to
accomplish each of the projects’ research agendas. Core 2 will provide support for both exploratory and
hypothesis-free analyses as well as for hypothesis-driven targeted identification of the molecules and pathways
identified in the research programs of each of the three projects. For example, a detailed analysis of the
sequencing data generated by the projects will reveal the changes in the somatic mutations, driver mutations,
clonal evolution, and mutational signatures due to hypernutrition and metabolic stress. This core will also
maintain a database linking all the biospecimens, organoids, PDOXs, and the associated data from all projects
and cores. As the different projects generate data, this core will integrate the data with analysis modalities to
identify, e.g., novel pathways and cross-talk between NRF2, ATF6, SAB, and other identified biomarkers."

10933086,"In people with HIV (PWH), infected cells persist in several tissue compartments, including
brain and lymphoid organs, and can remain indefinitely during combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART). This persistence is due to the ability of the virus to establish a state of latency in cells,
where the proviral DNA remains transcriptionally silent for long periods. The central nervous
system (CNS) is considered one of the viral reservoirs due to the blood-brain barrier, resulting in
cellular compartmentalization and limited penetrability of some antiretroviral drugs. The primary
cells that serve as reservoirs in the CNS compartment are microglia, macrophages, and
astrocytes; however, very little is known about HIV-1 infection of these cells and the establishment
of HIV-1 reservoirs in the CNS. Studies evaluating latent resting CD4+ T cells in the periphery
have shown that epigenetic regulation, histone modification, transcriptional control and
methylation in the 5' HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), which serves as the viral promoter,
facilitates viral latency. However, there remains limited understanding of how viral latency is
promoted and maintained in CNS microglia and macrophages. Accordingly, this proposal aims to
identify the key factors, pathways and their regulators, which determine the establishment and
reactivation of latent virus in the CNS. We hypothesize that HIV-1 latency establishment,
maintenance and reactivation in brain myeloid cell lineages are controlled by unique cellular
factors and their regulators specific to the CNS milieu that are distinct from latently infected CD4+
T cells in the periphery. Using our recently developed in vitro multicell lineage 3D-CNS organoids
with microglia from brains of HIV-1 positive donors, and infiltrating monocytes, a humanized
mouse model with infected microglia, and a precise Systems Biology approach, we will define the
on-off switches involved in myeloid cell reservoirs at the single cell level and HIV-1 latency in the
CNS. Successful completion of this study will identify new therapeutic targets (activators and
silencers) that are unique for myeloid cells in the CNS. A better understanding these factors can
improve treatment of PWH and can contribute to the development of a HIV-1 cure."
10935787,"The WISDOM Study, that includes 45,000 women in the US, is the first large-scale study of a risk-based
approach to breast cancer screening. Its goal is to determine if risk-based screening is as safe, less morbid
and preferred by women. The ‘WISDOM 1.0’ cohort, enrolling since 2016, began with a risk model that
integrates clinical risk factors, race/ethnicity, breast density, polygenic risk score (PRS), and sequencing for
moderate- and high-penetrance germline mutations.
However, in the past 7 years there have been significant advances in breast cancer risk assessment, such that
we have models that, for the first time, allow us to predict the type of cancer a woman is likely to develop.
Breast cancer is not one disease and women have different risk factors. Thus, it is the hypothesis of this P01
that tailoring screening and prevention recommendations to an individual’s risk as well as the type of cancer for
which she is at risk, can improve the efficacy and efficiency of breast cancer screening, improve the healthcare
value of screening and ultimately reduce breast cancer mortality, incidence, and screening burden.
The four Projects proposed represent a comprehensive research program to advance the science and
evaluation of subtype-specific risk-based breast cancer screening and prevention. In Project 1, we extend
enrollment of the WISDOM Study for 5 years, applying a subtype-specific risk assessment and screening that
delineates risk for fast-growing and slow-growing cancers, and assigns commensurate screening and
prevention recommendations. An additional 50,000 women will be enrolled via an expanded site network.
While Project 1 evaluates our initial fast vs. slow-growing risk models, Projects 2 and 3 will work to improve
subtype risk assessment in two ways, utilizing 5 large, diverse study cohorts with >200,000 women and
>14,000 breast cancer cases, with available imaging and germline data. Project 2 aims to develop improved
PRS for subtype-specific breast cancer risk, building on our preliminary predictor of fast-growing cancer.
Project 3 will apply deep-learning artificial intelligence models for subtype-specific risk based on 2D and 3D
mammographic imaging, and integrate with PRS from Project 2. Project 4 will take the best integrated subtype-
specific risk models and associated screening strategies from Project 3 and determine their impact on the
efficiency and efficacy of screening and prevention of slow growing cancers. We will work in collaboration with
the well-established MISCAN/CISNET modeling team to determine the potential impact for individuals as well
as the population of women in the US. The goal is to find the optimal risk classification schema, based on
reduction in cancer death as well as screening’s potential harms and improvement in overall healthcare value.
Our long-term goal is to iteratively reduce breast cancer mortality, while demonstrating that the WISDOM study
can ultimately serve as a continuous quality improvement platform for breast cancer screening and prevention.
Four cores support this extraordinary effort to bring smarter screening to women in the US."
10935788,"CORE A: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Program Project comprises four individual projects, which will: extend the WISDOM Study to evaluate the
use of subtype-specific risk models and associated screening recommendations in improving key metrics of
screening outcomes (Project 1); continuously develop better subtype-specific risk models using large
population cohorts and cases where we have imaging and genomic information that can be validated using the
WISDOM Study and other cohorts (Projects 2 and 3); and use the MISCAN model to estimate the long-term
benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of the subtype-specific risk approach and set thresholds/milestone
goals for subsequent updates to the WISDOM platform (Project 4).
The primary aims of the Administration, Communication and Project Management Core are to ensure program
integration, collaboration and scientific advancement by providing project management leadership and
administrative support to the Projects and Cores in four areas: Communications and meeting coordination, Project
management and oversight, Partnerships and external relations, and Program integration support.
Aim 1: Administrative Support to facilitate communication amongst investigators, projects,
participants, public, private partners, NCI, DSMB, Scientific Advisory Board
Aim 2: Provide project management for all of the projects within this P01 - support and tracking of the
individual projects and cores to ensure that all projects are completed on time and on budget
Aim 3: Facilitate transition of successful products and models developed within the Program Project and
support WISDOM protocol development as part of the WISDOM Stakeholder process.
The Administration, Communication and Project Management Core is the organizational hub of the Program
Project. A strong organizational hub focused on program progress, information exchange and readily available data
and resources is of utmost importance for the success of the Program. This includes the Cores and Projects
targeting risk assessment, imaging, iterative testing of risk models and screening thresholds, data collection
and educational tools, as well as managing advisory boards and importantly, stakeholder development and
ongoing engagement. A critical role of Core A is to facilitate collaboration and communication across projects
and teams, a role which Core A’s leadership has demonstrated within Athena, WISDOM, I-SPY 2, and MCL
consortium with great success. This is an experienced, multidisciplinary team capable of leading and managing
large, complex clinical trials with integrated biomarker components that has a proven track record for rapidly
and successfully integrating new processes and procedures using tested, systems-based approaches for
management and project execution."

Director and Co-Directors are senior administrators, institutional leaders, and researchers who have worked
together on the current funding period for this SPORE and on prior DF/HCC initiatives and, consequently,
provide consistent, strong, complementary leadership for the grant. The trans-institutional administrative team
consists of senior personnel at DF/HCC institutions who have worked together effectively in the current and prior
funding periods of this grant. We include a senior clinical investigator in the Administration Core to supervise
Glioma SPORE- specific clinical trials, and to enable this Glioma SPORE to capitalize on existing DF/HCC P30
Cores to support these types of studies. We have established and utilized an effective internal and external
committee structure to provide multidisciplinary expertise, advice, and oversight of the program. Each of the
committees consists of collaborative, complementary members who have worked together in the current and
prior funding periods of this SPORE or on prior projects. A series of regular Glioma SPORE meetings involving
both administrative and scientific SPORE personnel will continue to facilitate close collaboration,
troubleshooting, and monitoring of the SPORE program. We will continue an effective internal and external
communications program, which includes a Glioma SPORE-specific component. An established and extensive
DF/HCC communications infrastructure is utilized to promote open, regular, trans-institutional communication
regarding SPORE opportunities and activities. We will reinforce an active SPORE program to enhance
participation by women and individuals underrepresented in medicine and science."
10935602,"Project Summary
Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGGs) are collectively the most common brain tumor of childhood and
associated with devastating and life-long morbidity. pLGGs most often arise from single genetic driver events
involving the BRAF oncoprotein. This finding has paved the way for precision medicine approaches for pLGG,
leveraging MEK, BRAF and pan-RAF inhibitors. Research within our prior SPORE program identified the RAF
inhibitor tovorafenib as a promising compound for BRAF-altered pLGGs and generated structural insights into
its function. Our Phase 0/1 Clinical Trial of tovorafenib led to breakthrough drug designation by the FDA and
set the stage for a company-sponsored Phase 2 trial (FIREFLY-1) of tovorafenib in recurrent pLGG. While
early results are encouraging, response to tovorafenib is variable across patients for unclear reasons and there
remain important unmet needs for children with pLGG. There is a need to better understand RAF alterations
within pLGG at the cellular level and investigate if more specific RAF inhibitors, or combination therapies, could
improve the therapeutic window and efficacy. Additionally, many children with pLGGs will be cured by standard
of care (i.e. surgery and chemotherapy), and it is difficult to predict who needs targeted therapies and who can
be spared additional, potentially toxic treatments. Even children who are ultimately cured by standard of care
are followed with periodic MRIs that can be stressful for patients and parents alike. Non-invasive prognostic
technologies are needed to better define risk of recurrence in pLGG. To address these needs, we have three
specific aims: (1) to define RAF and MEK inhibitors with enhanced efficacy and tolerability for targeted
inhibition for pLGG, (2) to conduct a genomic “audit” of WT RAF expression in pLGG, and (3) to develop non-
invasive “child friendly” predictors of which children with pLGG are most likely to require and respond to RAF
antagonists. For (1), we will determine if (and how) other RAF isoforms aside from BRAF play a role in pLGG
tumor development and assess which RAF and MEK inhibitors, alone or in combination, most selectively target
the relevant RAF isoforms. For (2), we will leverage novel single-cell genomic profiling and mass spectrometry
technologies to probe the expression and activation state of RAF isoforms (A, B, and C) in surgically resected
pLGGs. The aim 2 study plan may explain why certain BRAF-altered tumors do not respond as well to
tovorafenib. For (3), we will utilize emerging, imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze
longitudinal MRI scans from a large multi-institutional database and the FIREFLY-1 tovorafenib study. We will
determine how volumetric trajectories change over time in pLGG patients on and off therapy, and if trajectories
can predict clinical progression. We will determine if voxel-based deep learning analysis of longitudinal MRI
can better predict recurrence and select patients who do (or do not) need RAF antagonists. Together, these
investigations will advance our understanding of pLGG at the micro- and macroscopic scale and provide
insights and tools to improve the therapeutic window of targeted therapies for children with pLGG."
10935603,"Project Summary
We propose a SPORE project on diffuse midline glioma (DMG)--a uniformly fatal glioma occurring mainly in
children. The prevalent oncogenic drivers for DMG are a set of recurrent amino acid substitutions in histone H3
(H3.3 and H3.1), wherein lysine 27 is mutated to methionine [H3K27M]. The mutated histones have no
enzymatic function and are thus completely undruggable. Various workarounds, including histone deacetylase
inhibitors and immunotherapy, are being developed but have yet to show clear benefit for DMG patients.
 Against this backdrop, during the current funding period of this SPORE, we conducted a genome-wide
CRISPR screen for DMG metabolic vulnerabilities. Our screen (Pal et al, Cancer Cell 2023) showed that
DMGs are “addicted” to the alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) pathway for repair of DNA double-strand breaks.
We identified a trio of clinical-stage, brain-penetrant drugs that target this addiction in complementary ways by
suppressing separate components of the alt-EJ pathway. Finally, we performed all pre-clinical requisite studies
for one of these drugs (orludodstat--a DHODH antagonist) towards support of a clinical trial trial in this project.
Our study plan builds upon this preliminary work and has three hypothesis-driven specific aims:
 Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pre-clinical findings with orludodstat can be recapitulated in children with
DMGs. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a lead-in phase 1 trial of orludodstat, followed by a phase 0/
target validation arm, in children with H3K27M DMG. We note that this pediatric trial will complement a trial
with the same drug for grade 2 IDH-mutant astrocytomas of young adults being developed by the Project 3
team of this SPORE. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that our alternate drugs for suppression of alt-EJ (POLQ
and ATR antagonists) will prove efficacious as single agents and in combinatorial regimens to overcome innate
or acquired resistance to DHODH inhibition. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that suppression of alt-EJ will enrich
for specific tumor cell subsets and stromal cell types in DMG patients. As a tool to test this hypothesis, we will
assemble a 3D reference map of DMG tumor cells, partially differentiated DMG subtypes, and normal stroma
using recently developed “spatial transcriptomic” technology from Dr. Filbin and her team.
 The study plan is enabled by an interactive collaboration among four investigators whose skillsets exceed
the sum of their component parts. Dr. Daphne Haas-Kogan is a physician-scientist with much practical
experience in clinical care of children with DMG. Basic scientist, Dr. Mariella Filbin, Scientific Director of the
Pediatric Brain Tumor Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, is a leader in single cell genomic analylis of pediatric
brain tumors. Dr. Sabine Mueller is an expert on design and conduct of clinical trials and leads the Pacific
Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC). Dr. Nathalie Agar provides specialized expertise in MALDI-
mass spectrometry imaging technology for visualizing drug penetrance and drug action in brain tumors."

10943341,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is a curative treatment for many blood diseases
and cancers. However, these procedures still need to be optimized to improve patient outcomes and survival.
HSPCs reside in a microenvironment surrounded by niche cells that help regulate their function. Our research
proposal seeks to address fundamental questions regarding the cellular interactions between HSPCs and niche
cells. During development in the embryo, HSPCs move through different tissues and have changing
requirements for contact with the microenvironment. HSPCs first arise in the dorsal aorta, a large vessel in the
embryo, and are then released into circulation. Next, HSPCs migrate to the fetal liver where the population of
cells expands via symmetric divisions. Finally, HSPCs migrate again to colonize the bone marrow where they
will remain throughout adulthood. As HSPCs are migrating between these different hematopoietic tissues, they
are also becoming more mature and are programmed towards their adult quiescent state. We use zebrafish and
mice as model systems that are highly conserved with humans and have many genetic tools for functional testing
and live imaging of cellular behaviors. In zebrafish, we have found a novel role for vascular endothelial growth
factor c (vegfc) in the release of HSPCs from the dorsal aorta. Vegfc also regulates a fate decision in pre-HSPCs
that determines if they will become a stem cell or a different type of progenitor cell. At later stages, we found that
integrin alpha 4 (itga4) in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), the zebrafish equivalent of the fetal liver, is
required for proper epigenetic programming of HSPCs. We hypothesize that dissecting niche-dependent HSPC
programming, using mutants with prolonged or shortened retention in developmental niches, will enable us to
decode mechanisms governing HSPC fate decisions and track their long-term impact on hematopoiesis. We will
address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of vegfc in fate
determination and release of HSPCs from the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta; 2) Establish
how itga4-dependent contact with the fetal/CHT niche programs HSPCs as they transition from immature
to mature states. We will perform in vivo genetic knockdown and small molecule treatments, together with live
imaging, to understand the dynamic interactions between HSPCs and niche cells. We will use a multiomics
approach to infer and functionally test the gene regulatory networks involved in HSPC programming. Together,
our proposed aims will identify functionally critical signals and networks that integrate to program HSPCs. Our
goal is for these novel insights and paradigms to improve HSPC-based therapies for patients."
10943827,"Project Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer. PDAC is the 4th leading cause of
cancer related death with a 5-year survival rate <12%, resulting in 200,000 deaths per year. Early detection of
tumor size one inch or less with surgical resection of pre-metastatic disease has the best survival benefit. Clinical
imaging is important in the early detection of small tumors. Unfortunately, no individual diagnostic imaging
technique is sufficiently accurate for the detection of small, potentially curable PDAC. PDAC has a profuse
extracellular matrix which can constitute 90% of tumor volume. A dominant cellular component of this matrix is
infiltrating immune monocytes including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs contribute to tumor
progression and treatment resistance through a variety of mechanisms, ultimately culminating in failed antitumor
immune responses. As a clinical imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET) is capable of
quantitating molecular features of MDSCs present in the PDAC that drive tumorigenesis, progression and
treatment resistance. Mechanistically, the chemokine receptor 2, CCR2, expressed on monocytes may be
instrumental in securing residence of these CCR2 positive monocytes in PDAC tumors. The monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a specific ligand to CCR2 and induces migration by binding to components
of the TME where MCP-1 expression is elevated. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a 18F-CCR2 PET
imaging agent can enable functional imaging of MDSC or other monocytic cells, thereby providing valuable
insight into their role during tumorigenesis, progression or response to therapy. This hypothesis will be tested by
completing the following specific aims: 1 Synthesis of CCR2 PET imaging tracers. SA1a. Synthesis of
18F-CCR2-1 and syntheses of three backup candidates. 2. In vitro characterization of 18F-CCR2 ligands. SA2a.
In PANC-1 and MIAPaCa2 cell lines. SA2b. In mouse bone marrow derived monocytes (BMDM) and human
monocytes. 3. To test and evaluate PET imaging capability of developed 18F-CCR2 candidates. SA3a. Selective
uptake of the 18F-CCR2 probes in tumors in immune compromised rodent orthotopic models of pancreatic cancer
determined by microPET and MR imaging. SA3b. CCR2 PET ligand specificity determined by blocking with non-
radiolabeled CCR2-1 ligand followed by microPET and MR imaging. SA3c. The sensitivity and the ability to
delineate tumor margins by PET will be evaluated in comparison to histo-pathology and autoradiography to
demonstrate that a 18F-CCR2 probe specifically binds to regions associated with CCR2+ macrophage
abundance. Overall, this project will enable development of an innovative, non-invasive imaging tool that acts as
a CCR2 antagonist."
10943867,"The goal of this proposal is to better understand a novel signaling axis initiated in prostate cancer (PCa)
patients by next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs). The standard use of ARSIs in PCa
patients help limit tumor progression, but inevitably result in the development of therapeutically resistant
disease. We have identified a synthetic lethal relationship established when ARSI is combined with CD105
antagonist, carotuximab, based on the finding that ARSI promote CD105 up regulation by PCa epithelia and
associated stromal fibroblasts, and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of CD105 receptor
signaling support multiple mechanisms of ARSI resistance. CD105 was found to be a mediator of androgen
receptor splice variants, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling, and treatment emergent small
cell neuroendocrine (t-SCNC) that are all demonstrated to limit ARSI sensitivity. CD105 expression by PCa
associated fibroblastic cells of the prostate and bone marrow also potentiated paracrine signaling by glutamine.
We reported the role of glutamine as not only a metabolite supportive of tumor expansion, it was necessary
and sufficient to impact t-SCNC and FGFR3 signaling. Importantly, either ARSI or carotuximab as single
agents had no effect on altering tumor progression in the preclinical models tested. We recently reported on a
phase 2 trial (NCT03418324) demonstrating feasibility of combining ARSI with carotuximab in re-sensitizing
PCa patients to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Given these findings, we will test the hypothesis that for PCa
demonstrating resistance to ARSI, the inhibition of CD105 in combination with apalutamide will provide
extended sensitivity compared to apalutamide alone by the following specific aims: Aim 1 is a prospective
analysis of advanced PCa patients with an ongoing randomized clinical trial receiving apalutamide in the
presence and absence of CD105 inhibition (NCT05534646). During this study, we will obtain prospective blood
for circulating tumor cells to understand how changes in biology relate to changes in clinical behavior. These
efforts will leverage a novel nanotechnology platform originating from the innovative molecular analysis
technologies program and whose current development is supported through the nanotechnology alliance in
cancer. Aim 2 will reveal the mechanism of action for the apalutamide/carotuximab combination. We will use
reverse translation approach to help identify the relevance of the novel glutamine-BMP/CD105 signaling axis in
PCa stromal-epithelial androgen signaling and define the criteria for selecting patients who will benefit from the
combination treatment. Pharmacodynamic responses in mice will be compared to that in men with castration
resistant prostate cancer from pre- and post-treatment samples from the trial."
10942041,"Project Summary
Human respiratory tissues have a unique cellular architecture and a mucus-based clearance system that,
together, constitute an impressive barrier to viruses that use the airway epithelium as their portal of entry. The
mucus-based clearance system acts as a physical, innate defense mechanism. Nasal epithelial cells have two
classes of protrusions on their surfaces—long motile cilia and short microvilli. Motile cilia are specialized
organelles that extend from the cell into the airway to drive mucociliary clearance. However, the mechanisms
used by respiratory viruses to breach this barrier and infect the respiratory epithelium are not well understood.
Our previous work has highlighted the crucial role of cilia in respiratory virus infection. Using cultured human
primary nasal epithelial cells, we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and RSV specifically attach to motile cilia
during infection. Importantly, inhibiting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 or RSV and cilia can effectively
suppress viral infections, indicating the critical role of the virus-cilia interaction. Furthermore, treatment with an
inhibitor of ciliary protein trafficking significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal epithelial cells. These
findings underscore the critical role of cilia during viral entry. Based on these findings, we propose specific aims
to understand how RSV and SARS-CoV-2 hijack nasal cilia for viral entry using the primary nasal epithelium as
a model. By comparing the infection mechanisms of RSV and SARS-CoV-2, we aim to gain a clearer
understanding of the differences between these viruses and the significance of nasal cilia in their respective
contexts."
10941775,"Project Summary
Heme enzymes are powerhouses for catalyzing a plethora of pivotal reaction pathways in humans, and have
been the focus of intense research interest throughout the past century. The ubiquitous nature of these enzymes
implicates them in a range of physiological functionalities, as well as pathogenic pathways that lead to an array
of disease situations including major neurodegenerative and autoimmune conditions, and cancer. In light of that,
numerous research efforts have focused on targeting heme enzymes for therapeutic purposes, particularly
through meticulously designed selective inhibitors. Nonetheless, a clear mechanistic understanding of a majority
of these crucial enzymes is still in its infancy, impeding the rational design of mechanism-based inhibitors that
could emerge into promising drug targets. Markedly, most of the mechanistic studies thus far have focused on
high-valent heme intermediates, whereby details pertaining to mid-valent heme species (i.e., those containing
Fe(III) centers such as heme superoxo, peroxo, hydroperoxo, peroxynitrite, hyponitrite etc.) have remained
gravely understudied. Importantly, heme enzymes where mid-valent species are active oxidants and/or key
reaction intermediates exhibit a growing significance in human health, making their mechanisms of action of
supreme interest. This research program targets this impactful deficit in current knowledge via the utilization of
carefully designed synthetic mimic compounds as mechanistic probes. The proposed work is predominantly
geared toward gaining a rigorous understanding into heme enzyme mediated nitrogen oxide (NOx/y)
interconversion pathways, which, albeit indispensable for normal physiological functions, could lead to nitrative
and nitrosative stress in humans under certain conditions. Thus, this project will strive to delineate the exact
attributes of heme centers that dictate the geometric and electronic properties of heme-NOx/y intermediates,
thereby fine-tuning the structure-activity relationships that choregraph the precision of their biorelevant reactivity
pathways. In that, a medley of synthetic heme-NOx/y model complexes supported by systematically varied ligand
architectures will be employed (i.e., in relevance to both primary and secondary coordination spheres of the
heme center), and their generation, stabilities, and competencies to engage in biorelevant reactivities will be
evaluated in detail. Mechanistic investigations will be carried out under cryogenic conditions, which will shine
light on the identities and properties of pivotal reaction intermediates; these intermediates will be rigorously
analyzed using a combined approach encompassing both spectroscopic and theoretical elements. Moreover,
the reaction landscapes of interest will also be examined using exhaustive thermodynamic and kinetic studies;
a layer of information that is often exceedingly difficult to obtain solely based on enzymatic systems. This work
will therefore further the frontiers of knowledge relevant to NOx/y interconversions facilitated by heme enzymes,
which will directly benefit ongoing efforts based on such pathways that target the design and implementation of
novel drug candidates with enhanced effectivity and specificity."

10942243,"Tradeoffs Between the Equal and Equitable Distribution of a Scarce Health Resource: Evidence from a
Large Randomized Natural Experiment with Targeting by Health, Social Vulnerability, and Race
The recent pandemic and supply chain disruptions have created scarcities in life-saving health resources from
ventilators to vaccines, highlighting the need for evidence-based guidance on how to navigate tradeoffs in
distributing them. Policy responses to scarcity have important implications for large and widening disparities by
health, social vulnerability, and race. Our long-term goal is to inform evidence-based policies to address
inequities and improve public health when resources are scarce. Our objective is to use economics to
analyze a tradeoff between two key goals. One is equality: the same chance at early access for all subgroups
of a population. Another is equity: the same average outcomes for all subgroups of a population. We are
uniquely positioned to overcome a major barrier to understanding tradeoffs between the equal and equitable
distribution of vaccines and other scarce health resources by applying rigorous methods from economics to a
credible research design based on a large randomized natural experiment that randomized early access to
vaccines to a large population of patients age ≥65 when doses were extremely scarce. We have three specific
aims. Aim 1: Estimate inequities in vaccine takeup along many detailed dimensions of health, social
vulnerability, and race using equality in early access via random assignment and rich data that we
construct and disseminate. This aim will analyze inequities in a large novel dataset constructed by linking
randomized invitations to electronic health records, survey data, and population-level data from vaccination,
death, salary, and voter registries, which we will share. This aim will also contextualize inequities from our
randomized setting using national population-level vaccination, health, and voter data to inform the impact of
further policies that target by geographic vs. individual characteristics. Aim 2: Quantify how much of the
inequities by health, social vulnerability, and race that persist given equality in early access via random
assignment can be explained by various mechanisms that operate through health behaviors, health
conditions, and social and environmental factors available in our electronic health records and survey
data. This aim will quantify the potential equity impacts of policies that address various mechanisms such as
distance to vaccination sites using approaches that go beyond targeting greater numbers of invitations. Aim 3:
Characterize how the composition of the vaccinated population changes by health, social vulnerability,
and race as the share vaccinated expands with randomization, and relate those changes to inequities in
downstream impacts of vaccination on health and economic wellbeing. This aim will inform the potential
for vaccine distribution policies to affect current and future inequities in health and economic wellbeing."
10904500,"Polygenic scores (PS) represent an exciting translational application of genomic information that
can mitigate some short comings of traditional genetic approaches, and which have great
potential towards understanding and leveraging genetic predisposition to health traits. However,
key barriers to clinical application exist, prominently including the fact that current PS were
developed nearly exclusively using European individuals. These PS are much less predictive
when applied to non-European populations (e.g. African Americans). Second is that there has
been only very limited application of PS to pharmacogenomics, despite that medication use is
arguably the most common and impactful type of medical intervention for patients with common
chronic diseases. The goal of this proposed project is to develop novel methods to create and
validate PS for African Americans that predict medication response in common complex
conditions. To accomplish the goal of valid and ancestry robust PS for African Americans, we
will develop innovative analytic approaches that incorporate localized ancestry to construct PS
in a manner that allows for SNP selection and the allelic effect to be dependent on the local
ancestry context, thus creating tools that are robust to varying genetic admixture and population
structure. We will then compare the performance of these novel tools to two current methods
(including state-of-the-art Bayesian approaches) within cohorts of African American patients
across two different common complex diseases (heart failure and diabetes)."
10906161,"Abstract
Naphthalenones are bicyclic scaffolds found in many natural and synthetic compounds which display diverse
biological activities and serve as building blocks to access more complex molecules. Naphthalenones have been
successfully synthesized via dearomatization of naphthols with simultaneous installation of new C–C or C–X
bonds. Formation of these new quaternary centers with stereoselective control has proven to be a synthetic
challenge and commonly requires use of expensive, rare, or toxic transition metals. In few cases where earth
abundant iron or organic catalysts are utilized, enantioselective control and/or yield are compromised. Biocata-
lysts provide a great alternative for a more sustainable synthetic route which operate under mild conditions,
generate enantioenriched products, reduce side products, and achieve high substrate selectivity. Through itera-
tive rounds of genetic mutation and natural selection, enzymes can evolve to catalyze new-to-nature reactions.
Herein, I propose to engineer an alternative catalytic route to synthesize chiral naphthalenones utilizing the di-
verse library of hemoproteins developed by the Arnold group. This work will be achieved through engineering
and evolving hemoproteins for (i) dearomative amination of 2-naphthols by nitrene insertion, (ii) dearomatization
of 2-naphthols by carbene insertion, and (iii) further functionalization of naphthalenone core scaffolds by stereo-
specific biocatalytic reactions. These reactions will be the first of its kind to be characterized in hemoproteins.
The products of these reactions will feature new quaternary carbon centers and will expand current mechanistic
knowledge of the robust hemoproteins and their abilities to tame reactive carbenes and nitrenes for highly en-
antioselective reactions. This work will explore new methods to access substituted polycyclic structures in a
facile and sustainable approach expanding the synthetic feasibility of biologically relevant naphthalenones. The
biocatalytic method generated in this proposal will begin to elucidate new strategies for dearomatization and
allow for transformation of many readily available 2-dimensional aromatic feedstocks into intricate pharmaco-
phores."
10943490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Studies have demonstrated that adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) repair
myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by indirect paracrine mechanisms rather than by
differentiation and tissue replacement. In the past decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as
promising cell-free agents for treating ischemic injury. Several exosome-based therapeutic companies have
launched early phase clinical trials. However, the large-scale production of EVs remains a challenge. We seek
to develop a scale-up friendly method to generate a large number of therapeutic nanovesicles (NVs) from
MSCs by extrusion. Passing through a series of extrusion microfilters, the MSCs can be converted into billions
of NVs. Those engineered cell vesicles serve as “cell-drones” to deliver biological information to the recipient
cells. Companies such as MDImune and SQZ Biotech are conducting clinical trials using extruded
nanovesicles in the area of oncology and infectious diseases. We wonder whether those cell-drones would
carry the regenerative materials from MSCs and can promote tissue repair in a way similar or superior to
naturally secreted EVs. In this proposed study, we plan to investigate the fabrication, characterization and
toxicity of NVs (Preliminary study). After that, we will test the therapeutic effect of NVs on a mouse model (AIM
1) and a porcine model (AIM 2) with cardiac I/R injury. Then, we will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
therapeutic benefits of MSC NVs and create “super” NVs with enhancement cargos (AIM 3). This leads to our
central hypothesis that extrusion is a highly efficient method to generate a large quantity of therapeutic NVs
that can potentially be manipulated, and may replace EVs in regenerative medicine applications."
10931913,"Abstract. Mosquitoes kill nearly half-a-million people each year. Due to lack of effective
vaccines for most mosquito-borne diseases, prevention of mosquito bites remains the primary
focus of disease mitigation. Larval surveillance - monitoring potential breeding sites to
understand larval species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution - is key to enabling
precision vector control. If medically relevant larvae are detected, targeted larvicide treatments
can eliminate the population prior to emergence as adult mosquitoes, when disease
transmission occurs. Unfortunately, due to its resource-intensive nature, few mosquito control
organizations (MCOs) have the capacity to conduct the full-process of larval surveillance with
identification to species. Technicians need to travel to the potential breeding site, collect
specimens, return to the lab for visual morphological identification under a microscope, and if
medically relevant species are found, return to the field for larvicide treatments. Delayed,
inaccurate, or missing larval species data can miss an opportunity for intervention prior to
emergence of adults, or misinform costly unnecessary treatment. While significant efforts have
been made to explore crowdsourcing larval data and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for rapid
assessments of potential breeding sites, implementation and technical challenges have limited
practical use of these approaches. No automated solutions exist to build larval species
identification capacities. We propose to develop the first commercially available image
recognition platform for operational larval surveillance of the 20 most relevant mosquito species
in the US. This proposal will first validate the optical requirements for species identification of
larvae. This will enable the development of a standardized imaging configuration that will be
used to build a high-quality image dataset of mosquito larvae of different species capturing
diagnostic morphological features. The image dataset will be used to train a computer vision
system to identify species of mosquito larvae. Ultimately the approaches developed here will
enable new larval surveillance products, from an identification field-tool to inform technician
larviciding at the point of specimen collection, to remote sensing systems that will continuously
monitor historical breeding sites and alert mosquito control organizations (MCOs) when
intervention is needed."
10934140,"OVERALL COMPONENT – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This revised application for a Program Project seeks support for a coordinated, multi-disciplinary investigation
of molecular mechanisms that underly clinically important immune-mediated thrombocytopenic and thrombotic
disorders. The Program is housed at Versiti's Blood Research Institute and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia –
both nationally renowned facilities with long-standing commitments to basic, translational, and clinical blood-rela-
ted research, particularly in the areas of platelet immunology, platelet activation, thrombosis, and B cell immuno-
biology. These disciplines are of programmatic significance to the NHLBI, and of central importance to trans-
fusion medicine and classical hematology - disciplines that, despite their impact on the nation's health, are cur-
rently underrepresented in both human and financial resources. Our application reflects ongoing, close collabor-
ative ties amongst the Project Leaders, some for more than three decades, and is bolstered by a strong history
of interdependence that has allowed us to tackle thematically related issues of clinical relevance and importance.
The central unifying theme of our application is to build on and develop a deeper understanding of clinically rele-
vant immunological insults that lead to thrombocytopenia and downstream pathophysiological sequelae in the
fetus, newborn, and adult. The Program comprises three highly synergistic, interdependent Projects, each of
which is characterized by (1) examination of an unpredictable pathology attributable to a subset of antigen-spe-
cific antibodies that, in addition to causing thrombocytopenia, also adversely affect other cell types, and (2) judi-
cious use of preclinical mouse models that are specifically designed to investigate the etiology of different forms
of immune thrombocytopenia. Project 1: The Immunobiology of Fetal/Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia
(FNAIT) employs a novel antigen-specific mouse model and a battery of clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies
to define the functional significance of specific maternal antibody subpopulations that contribute mechanistically
to, and may be diagnostic of, the severity of FNAIT. The etiology of this disorder is examined by exploring routes
of antigen exposure that cause maternal alloimmunization to occur unpredictably in first pregnancies. Project 2:
The Immunobiology of Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) uses sophisticated human antibody cloning
techniques and analysis to identify and characterize the specific pathogenic antibody subpopulations that cause
HIT, and explores an intriguing role for the gut microbiome in the etiology of this man-made immunological dis-
order. Project 3: The Immunobiology of Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) examines novel
mechanisms by which platelet factor 4, platelet basic protein, and neutrophil activating peptide 2 contribute to
the etiology of this rare, but life-threatening, immunologically mediated disorder. Taken together, there is strong
scientific and programmatic rationale for this comprehensive effort to examine molecular and cellular mechan-
isms that underly the immune-mediated thrombocytopenias. Insights and concepts derived from these basic
studies should enhance the development of novel, clinically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic applications."
10931995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Objective: The goal of this SBIR CRP project is to move a novel hemodialysis access graft design through the
major commercialization milestone of 510(k) submission. This STARgraft device is currently in an active clinical
trial, with outcomes to date showing evidence of superior resistance to infection and occlusion failure compared
to on-market grafts.
There are two major task areas for this late-stage development project:
 • Formal testing against the FDA requirements and standards for this device type, including animal studies,
 in qualifying a replacement ePTFE core component for the silicone-ePTFE composite graft construction
 (the ePTFE core tubing used to date has been discontinued by the supplier).
 • 510(k) preparation, submission and clearance.
Significance: The need for treatments at least 3 times per week makes maintenance of reliable vascular access
for hemodialysis patients extremely challenging. More than half of all first-year hemodialysis patients, and 20%
longer term, are treated via “last-resort” infection prone catheters. Successful clinical introduction of a
synthetic AV graft with significantly increased resistance to infection and improved reliability in maintaining
blood flow would increase access options and the quality of life for a significant number of patients, and very
importantly, enable a significant reduction in the use of catheters.
Innovation: The STARgraft approach is a new way to address both infection concerns and the recurrent venous-
end stenosis failures in existing arterio-venous (AV) bypass access grafts. The STARgraft retains a conventional
ePTFE core as the blood contact and primary structural element but features an exterior biointerface that
incorporates with the surrounding tissue in a unique manner. This response exhibits a dramatically greater
degree of vascularity than is found surrounding ePTFE-only devices, minimizing fibrotic capsule development
and the consequent mechanical constriction effects on the graft. The vascularized and stress-relaxed tissue
interface is more resistant to bacterial biofilm infections induced by repeated cannulations, and it allows the
graft wall to elastically flex in response to pulsatile blood flow. Compared to a plain ePTFE graft, this flexure
maintains a hemodynamic environment for blood cells and tissue inside the graft more closely resembling that
in natural arteries and veins and provides longer-term flow stability.
Approach: Specific aims of the CRP are straightforward: 1) Verify product design and development with the
new core graft, 2) Validate in a 20-week GLP animal study, and 3) FDA 510(k) submission and clearance.
Impact: 510(k) clearance, coupled with successful clinical results obtained prior and in parallel to the CRP
project, will allow the company to attract the needed additional private investment for successful commercial
launch, providing a safer and more reliable access graft option for a large number of dialysis patients.

hearing) involves overcoming anatomical frequency mismatch, the discrepancy between the normal
cochlear frequency-place function and that imposed by the CI. This can result in perceptual frequency
mismatch, defined as the difference between pitch percepts elicited by a sound in a normal ear and a CI-
stimulated ear. Importantly, higher levels of perceptual frequency mismatch are associated with poorer speech
perception. Fortunately, the human auditory system is plastic and perceptual frequency mismatch decreases
over time. The current standard of care is based on the assumption that such adaptation can completely
compensate for anatomical frequency mismatch. However, the literature and our pilot data indicate that this
assumption is often incorrect.
An alternative approach to improve speech perception and sound quality is to use frequency-place maps that
match the physiological frequency-place function, with the goal of making adaptation unnecessary. This
approach may also be suboptimal. Given typical insertion depth of CI electrodes, matching the physiological
frequency-place function can only be done at the cost of failing to deliver low-frequency information. This
unexplored tradeoff will be studied in the aims that follow. Our overall goal is to study the extent and possible
limitations of the adaptation process that underlies speech perception improvement, and to test personalized
medicine approaches that seek to accelerate and improve adaptation outcomes after CI activation.
Aim 1 will study adaptation to frequency mismatch in single-sided deaf (SSD) CI users longitudinally, starting at
CI activation. SSD-CI users are ideal for this purpose as they can provide a precise comparison between
normal acoustic stimulation and CI stimulation. This will be done using two innovative tools: one that is speech-
based, and another one that represents a generalization of electroacoustic pitch matching. Aim 2 will examine
adaptation over time using a broader set of central and peripheral measures in a more traditional population of
CI users who lack usable residual hearing. Lastly, and as a complement to the observational studies in Aim 1,
Aim 3 will evaluate different interventional approaches to overcome frequency mismatch in CI users, including
SSD CI users (Aim 3a) and CI users without usable residual hearing (Aim 3b).
The proposed experiments will provide foundational information about the nature, extent, and potential
limitations of perceptual adaptation after CI activation, as well as a path for translation of these results to
clinical practice."
10942631,"Neuro-immune mechanisms against skin-penetrating helminths
Summary
Diverse helminth species establish host infection through direct skin penetration, but the mechanisms of
cutaneous immunity are poorly understood. Curiously, percutaneous infection of over 250 million people with the
water-borne blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni often goes unnoticed and most of these individuals experience
frequent re-infection due to poor immune responses to skin-penetrating larvae. Whether a mechanistic link exists
between impaired protective immunity and failure of skin afferent neurons to release immunostimulatory factors
is a major gap in our current understanding of host immunity. Moreover, the role of the alarmin cytokine
interleukin 33 (IL-33) in driving host resistance or susceptibility to skin penetration by helminth larvae has not
been tested. Our data reveal that pre-emptive activation of mouse skin-afferents drives innate resistance to
parasite invasion accompanied by the recruitment of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4 and gd T cell subsets,
and inflammatory monocytes. Surprisingly, skin neuron activation also rapidly depletes IL-33 in tissue
macrophages and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2), but not skin fibroblasts. Indeed, mice with a genetic
deletion of IL-33 only in CD11c+ myeloid antigen presenting cells (APC) phenocopy host immune responses in
wild-type mice with activated skin-sensory neurons. This project seeks to identify the specific neuron subsets
and the soluble mediators they release that drive host resistance and discern whether such protection requires
loss of myeloid-specific IL-33. One of the key immunoregulatory neuropeptides released by skin afferents is
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and our data show that CGRP administration results in myeloid APC-
intrinsic loss of IL-33 through unknown mechanism(s). Therefore, our central hypothesis that itch-responsive
skin neurons initiate host resistance to skin penetrating helminths via CGRP-mediated reduction of
myeloid-specific IL-33, which initiates production of IL-17-promoting cytokines from skin macrophage
and cDC subsets. The two specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Identify the neuron subsets necessary and
sufficient for skin resistance to helminth infection and (2) determine how CGRP causes decrease in myeloid-
specific IL-33 and host resistance to parasite invasion. Successful completion of this project designed to
understand how sensory neuron-APC interactions control host protection and IL-33 expression stands to provide
key insight(s) for developing preventative measures against helminth skin penetration in humans, which do not
currently exist."
10941909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA-protein interactions play a fundamental role in biology through complex processes regulating gene expression
programs. Perturbation of native RNA-protein assemblies (RNP) alters gene expression and can result in diseases,
from infection to cancer to neurodegeneration. This proposal focuses on the discovery of chemical modulators of
RNA-protein assemblies through the systematic targeting of DEAD-box RNA-dependent ATPases. DEAD-box
ATPases are the driving force of many RNP remodeling processes, including the functioning of RNA polymerase
II, the spliceosome, the ribosome, and biomolecular RNA condensates. Unsurprisingly, mutations in DEAD-box
genes are implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and rare genetic diseases. Despite their biological
importance, our understanding of the remodeling activities and functions remains rudimentary for most of the 37
DEAD-box proteins in the human genome. We propose that developing selective chemical modulators of DEAD-
box proteins will propel biological studies of known and yet-to-be-discovered RNP and may lead to new drugs. As
DEAD-box ATPases allosterically regulate RNA affinity through distal communication with the catalytic site, we
hypothesize that we can generate selective inhibitors exploiting these allosteric mechanisms. We will provide proof-
of-concept for this approach through three projects: 1. Identify allosteric compounds that act as glues of DEAD-box
proteins in complex with RNA by screening the large St. Jude compound collection. 2. Optimize stabilizers of RNA-
helicase interaction for cell-based activity. We will combine ligand discovery with genetic-based approaches to
generate a chemical probe for studying DDX19 function in Ewing sarcoma. 3. Systematic discovery of targetable
allosteric circuits in DEAD-box ATPases. We have identified ligands that bind DDX19 together with the nucleotide
cofactor. We will extend this approach to five structurally similar, but biologically and mechanistically distinct, DEAD-
box ATPases. Using protein NMR and structural analyses, we will identify chemically targetable allosteric circuits
and analyze their functional roles across the DEAD-box protein family. This multidisciplinary program will combine
structure-based design (synthetic chemistry and X-ray crystallography), protein dynamics (NMR), computational
methods, biochemistry, and cell biology to determine how chemical modulators of RNA-protein assemblies can be
generated. Successful completion of these projects will break new ground and could yield first-in-class chemical
probes for fundamental biological processes, providing approaches that are broadly applicable to nucleic acid-
dependent ATPases and extendable to other protein-RNA interactions."
10928988,"ABSTRACT
Fentanyl is a widely used opioid in the clinic for relieving chronic pain. Fentanyl abuse leads to mortality due to
opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). OIRD is a major health concern in the USA and there is an
unmet need for developing therapeutic strategies for mitigating OIRD. Breathing is regulated by brainstem
neurons generating respiratory rhythm. Sensory feedback from carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors, which
stimulate breathing, is an important regulator of breathing. Current evidence suggests that OIRD is in part due
to fentanyl-induced inhibition of brainstem neurons by µ-opioid receptors (MORs). the effects of fentanyl on CB
are not known. Preliminary data showed fentanyl stimulates CB sensory nerve (CSN) activity acting on κ-
opioid receptors (κ-ORs) and co-administration of fentanyl and a κ-OR agonist prevent OIRD. Based on these
observations, we will test the hypotheses: a) fentanyl stimulates CB acting as a partial κ-OR agonist by
elevating [Ca2+]I in glomus cells through κ-OR-Gαq signaling and b) full activation of CB with co-application of
fentanyl and a κ agonist mitigate OIRD without compromising analgesic effects of fentanyl. These hypotheses
are tested in rats and mice using repertoire of approaches. Studies in AIM 1 determine relative abundance of
κ-ORs in the rat and murine CBs and assess their role in CB activation by fentanyl. AIM 2 delineate the role of
κ-OR-Gαq signaling in [Ca2+]I elevation by fentanyl in glomus cells and assess its significance in CB activation.
AIM 3 tests the hypothesis that co-application of fentanyl and κ-OR agonist mitigate OIRD without
compromising analgesic efficacy of fentanyl and assess whether CB is the site of action. Major conceptual and
technical innovations include that a) Fentanyl activates CB through κ-ORs as opposed to inhibition of
brainstem neurons by µOR; b) Mitigating OIRD with κ-OR agonist is a hitherto unexplored concept that may
have important therapeutic implications and c) Integrating various standard and state-of-the-art approaches
provide information at the systems level and cellular insights. The proposed studies provide much-needed
framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies for mitigating OIRD."

Continuing funds are requested by 18 vision scientists (holding 20 eligible NEI R01 grants) and their
personnel to support three resource and an administrative core in the Department of Ophthalmology
Visual and Anatomical Sciences (former Ophthalmology and Anatomy/Cell Biology Departments). The
Imaging/Histopathology (I/H Core) will be directed by Dr. Susmit Suvas, an R01-funded investigator with
significant imaging expertise. Together with the PI, and two research assistants, the environment and
capability to conduct vision research at Wayne State University and affiliated institutions will be
enhanced through prioritization of the work of NEI R01 funded investigators, their staff and students
(graduate and fellows) in numerous aspects of Imaging and Histopathology. The I/H core, (in Scott Hall)
is readily accessible to vision scientists, and will provide for visual function analysis, embedding,
sectioning/cryosectioning and immunostaining of tissues for confocal laser scanning, light microscopy,
immunofluorescence, OCT and other cell imaging analyses (e.g., cell viability and quantification of
plasma membrane potential), and train in equipment use. The I/H Core will foster collaboration among
NEI R01 funded investigators primarily, and at reduced priority for unfunded colleagues. Clinical and
translational studies also will continue to be fostered between NEI R01 funded investigators and
clinicians in the merged department (OVAS). The I/H Core also will support, at reduced priority, new

Our vision is to develop, apply, and advance new technologies in the broad thematic program of the manipulation
of nucleic acids. The research largely focuses on RNA-based applications, which is both driven and enhanced
by our unique environment at The RNA Institute, enabling easy collaboration and cross pollination of ideas and
techniques across fields. The importance of RNA and RNA technologies has never been clearer, with a pandemic
RNA virus (SARS-CoV-2) being managed by RNA biosensing tools and mRNA-based vaccines. It is now well
accepted that RNA plays a complex role in biology that goes far beyond the “central dogma”. Elucidating many
RNA functions and biomedical applications requires investment in technology development. In this proposal,
carried out over the next five years, we aim to advance technology in three main areas: 1) DNA nanoswitches
as programmable nanoscale reagents for reporting molecular interactions, 2) the Centrifuge Force Microscope
(CFM) for high throughput single molecule probing and analysis, and 3) DNA nanotechnology for applications in
drug delivery and sensing. Each of these areas builds on our strengths and past performance.
In the first area, we use DNA nanoswitches as “smart” reagents that change conformation upon binding a target
molecule. Building on past success, we will expand this innovative method to enable low cost and simple RNA
detection, quantification, and purification for various RNAs. These include detection of RNA modifications,
detection of regulatory lncRNAs, and purification of RNA and RNA complexes. In the second area, we will
develop and execute assays for the Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM) in RNA and DNA interaction analysis
and RNA structure-function probing. In particular, we will investigate fundamental thermodynamics of weak
interactions in DNA and RNA, develop a new method for single-molecule structural probing of RNA, and study
the structure-function relationship of a pre-clinical therapeutic ribozyme. In the third area, relatively new for our
lab, we expand work to analyze and develop DNA nanotechnology for applications including drug delivery.
Specifically, we are interested in understanding and “programming” biostability into DNA nanostructures, and in
coordinating chemical attachment and triggered release of molecular payloads from DNA nanostructures.
This proposal aims to carry out ambitious research and development plans performed within the context of
several biomedical projects. The impact of the developments will extend beyond the individual projects, as our
core technologies and methods are increasingly adopted by other groups. In the first MIRA term we have proven
our ability to develop impactful technology and advance innovative science on several fronts. In this second term,
we aim show sustainability of our research endeavors, solidifying our niches, maintaining high productivity, and
ultimately producing knowledge and tools to benefit the scientific community."
10929988,"Heme-Dependent Chemistry in Aromatic Oxidation
Abstract
Heme-containing enzymes are ubiquitous, contributing to various processes and catalyzing a vast array of
oxidative chemistries. Histidine-ligated heme enzymes, such as the heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase
(HDAO) superfamily, can use either molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to oxidize their substrates. What
is currently not understood are the molecular factors that engender these enzymes with their respective
specificities, i.e., after generation of the critical active oxidant, how is a single reaction type catalyzed. The
answer to this question will broaden our fundamental understanding of enzyme catalysis, de novo enzyme
design, and protein engineering. This application focuses on the structural and mechanistic characterization of
three aromatic-oxidizing enzymes of the HDAO superfamily that are involved in natural product and
antimicrobial drug biosynthesis: TyrH, SfmD, and MarE. TyrH is a group of heme-dependent L-DOPA forming
monooxygenase in the biosynthesis of antibiotics with a pyrroline moiety. SfmD mediates the regioselective
hydroxylation of 3-methyl-L-tyrosine for synthesizing the core quinone structure of saframycin A. MarE forms
an oxindole structure for many compounds. These enzymes play important roles in the biosynthetic pathway of
secondary metabolites found in many biologically active natural products and pharmaceutical lead compounds.
Our primary goal is to understand the key factors that govern their hydroxylation mechanisms and their
differing strategies to form oxidizing intermediates with these enzymes. We have utilized a broad spectrum of
approaches to probe the intricate molecular details of these enzyme mechanisms using noncanonical amino
acids, substrate analogs, time-resolved UV-vis and EPR spectroscopies, kinetics, and isotope-labeling studies,
and we have been successful trapping on-pathway reaction intermediates in crystallo. The proposed work will
test our hypotheses regarding i) how the heme-based oxidant is generated, ii) how oxygen is directed to the
substrate, and iii) unravel the structural factors that affect catalysis. The outcome of the proposed studies is an
in-depth understanding of these three related catalytic systems to aid the development of scaffolds for rational
drug design and discovery processes."

10929994,"ABSTRACT
 Vision is one of the fundamental senses that enables the perception of the surrounding environment. In
humans, this process is initiated in the retina, which is lined with millions of photoreceptors expressing opsins
bound to the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal (11-cis-RAL). Absorption of a photon by the opsin-bound visual
chromophore causes its isomerization to an all-trans configuration. This initial photochemical reaction triggers
the activation of a signal transduction cascade that eventually leads to the transmission of visual information to
the brain, while the activated opsin is rendered insensitive to further light stimulation. Sustained vision thus
requires continuous renewal of the visual chromophore following light exposure, a process thought to be
accomplished through the canonical retinoid (visual) cycle. Here, we propose to explore a non-canonical
complementary pathway for the photic generation of 11-cis-RAL. Our long-term goal is to obtain a better
understanding of the retinoid cycle and other pathways capable of regenerating the visual chromophore and to
develop interventions that stop the progression of human retinal diseases related to these metabolic events.
 Accordingly, we propose four thematically and experimentally linked Specific Aims to: 1) improve our
mechanistic insights regarding a photochemical reaction catalyzed by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-retinal
G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) that can generate 11-cis-RAL. We will determine the quantum yield (Φ) of
recombinant RGR and compare its rate of photoisomerization with the activity of RPE65, the enzymatic
isomerase of the RPE visual cycle. We also will test the influence of retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) and cellular-
retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP encoded by Rlbp1 gene) as modulators of the RGR-based
photoisomerase activity; 2) determine the role of RGR in RPE and Müller cells (MC). To accomplish this
objective, we will investigate conditional Rgr-/- mice that permit the temporal regulation of the expression of RGR;
3) establish the contribution of RPE and MC separately to both the visual cycle as well as the photochemical
production of 11-cis-RAL using the traceable artificial chromophore 9-cis-RAL; and 4) establish the role of
CRALBP in RPE and MC during the regeneration of rod and cone visual pigments, by employing genetic and
pharmacological approaches. We will evaluate the effects of RPE/MC-specific Rlbp1 deletion on the
regeneration of rod and cone visual pigments, along with photoreceptor function in the presence and absence
of potent inhibitors of RPE65.
 In summary, recent advances pertaining to the photic generation of 11-cis-RAL in the RPE have added a new
and novel physiological element to our understanding of the cellular pathways capable of regenerating the visual
chromophore. However, these advances have yet to be fully integrated with what we know about the canonical
visual cycle. Here, we will provide a more unified perspective on both processes. These new insights will then
be utilized to generate innovative pharmacological approaches to treat blinding diseases in humans."

Ultra-high-throughput plate reader for drug discovery using all-optical electrophysiology
Neurological disorders remain a major unmet medical need in the United States and worldwide, accounting for
more than 10% of the total years of healthy life lost in developed countries. Drug discovery for diseases of the
nervous system has been challenging in comparison with other disease areas. A major barrier to progress in
neuroscience drug discovery is the lack of translatable assays, models, and technologies that can be used to
predict human efficacy with both the information content and throughput needed for rapid identification and
optimization of therapeutic candidates. As such, there is a strong commercial need for scalable assay and
instrument platforms that can be leveraged throughout the CNS-based drug screening and discovery pipeline.
The Swarm microscope, developed through Phase I and Phase II efforts, leverages Q-State’s proprietary
Optopatch technology, enabling the recording of both voltage and calcium activity under optical stimulation from
24-objectives simultaneously. Our instrument has the potential to transform high-throughput screening (HTS) by
leveraging our advanced optogenetics tools in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well plate formats. The instrument was
successfully used to screen Q-State’s 200,000 internal compound library against Nav1.7, a genetically validated
target for pain, on our Spiking HEK cell assay demonstrating the utility of the Swarm for CNS-based therapeutic
discovery.
In this Phase IIB application, Q-State will leverage these technologies and expertise towards full
commercialization by building the next generation Swarm 2.0 platform with significantly improved functionality,
throughput, and stability. First, we will develop a camera-based Swarm 2.0 instrument with upgraded illumination,
stimulation, and detection subassemblies and pair these capabilities with new analysis tools. Next, we will
develop two differentiating Swarm 2.0 compatible optogenetic classes of assays: 1) target-based HEK cell
assays for voltage-gated Na channels, representing a major class of drug targets for CNS disorders, and 2)
intact, native cell assays in neurons, enabling critical bridging secondary assays for therapeutic discovery. After
the instrument is constructed and validated, we will optimize Nav1.8, a drug target for pain indications currently
pursued by the pharmaceutical industry, and secondary multiplexed spiking HEK assays for HTS compatibility
on the platform. Finally, we will perform a screening campaign using an in-house library of approximately 200,000
small molecules for inhibitors of Nav1.8 followed by the hit confirmation and selectivity counter-screens. At the
conclusion of this Phase IIB work, the Swarm 2.0 platform will be fully validated for commercialization, generating
chemical hits that can be optimized for pain therapeutics and more broadly by enabling execution of HTS
compound screens with the potential for expansion into new assay types. Success in Phase IIB has the potential
for significant impact both in neuroscience research and in enabling our novel, proprietary platform for drug
discovery for CNS-based disorders such as severe epilepsy and pain, areas of significant unmet medical need."
10930310,"Project 4 Summary
 Motor circuits in the vertebrate brain are arranged hierarchically. Low-level circuits in the
brainstem and spinal cord – such as the oscillators and pattern generators that control breathing
and locomotion – can autonomously generate basic motor patterns. High-level motor circuits allow
animals to learn and adapt movements, detect and correct errors, predict the cost and benefits of
actions, and assemble movements into complex sequences to attain behavioral goals over long
time scales. High-level circuits do not generally control movements directly, rather, they engage
and coordinate the basic motor actions produced by low-level circuits during complex behavior.
Low-level circuits in turn integrate an array of inputs from many high-level areas to synthesize the
motor commands that drive motoneurons and muscles.
 In this Project, we focus on a molecular and anatomical dissection of the structure of high-
and low-level circuits that are responsible for controlling orofacial movements, and the structure
of the circuits connecting high- and low-levels of the motor system hierarchy. Orofacial
movements are amongst the most precisely controlled movements within the mammalian
repertoire for movements and support behaviors most critical for survival – the consumption of
food and water, respiration, and communication. Using a suite of tools for viral genetic circuit
tracing, whole-brain imaging, single-neuron reconstruction, and molecular labeling, we will first
determine the architecture of low-level circuitry in the mouse medulla responsible for orofacial
movement at the level of single-cell axonal morphologies. Second, we will determine the brain-
wide distribution of cells that are synaptically connected to low-level orofacial motor circuits and
responsible for their control. Third, we will determine the structure of descending pathways from
higher-order orofacial motor regions that connect to low-level medullar circuits. Finally, we will
determine which elements of low-level motor circuits are under direct high-level control at the level
of molecularly defined cell types.
 All told, this investigation will provide a blueprint of a critical motor system in the mammalian
brain across levels of the motor system hierarchy."

10934265,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has historically graded meningiomas according to histological
features, and many WHO grade 1 meningiomas can be effectively treated with surgery or radiotherapy, but many
WHO grade 2 or grade 3 meningiomas are resistant to treatment and cause significant neurological morbidity
and mortality. Approximately 30% of WHO grade 1 meningioma develop recurrences that cannot be predicted
from histological features, and some WHO grade 2 or grade 3 meningiomas are unexpectedly well controlled
with surgery and radiotherapy. These data indicate that improvements in risk stratification and new therapies for
patients with meningiomas are needed, but limited understanding of meningioma biology and the misconception
that all meningiomas are benign has encumbered medical and scientific advances for patients with meningiomas.
 Using multiplatform molecular profiling on 2092 meningiomas from 13 institutions, we discovered DNA
methylation groups and a gene expression biomarker that improve risk stratification compared to all other
classification systems across all WHO grades. Our data demonstrate that meningiomas from the DNA
methylation group with the worst outcomes are vulnerable to cell cycle inhibitors (28%), and that gene expression
profiling predicts which meningiomas will benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (32%). Cooperative group
trials, clinical guidelines, and classification systems that incorporate our DNA methylation and gene expression
biomarkers are under development. More broadly, our biomarkers provide a framework for understanding how
meningiomas grow and respond to therapy, but biomarkers that are based on one sample from a single point in
time may not be optimal. Here we propose to study (1) biological drivers, (2) imaging features, and (3) therapeutic
vulnerabilities underlying DNA methylation and gene expression biomarkers using regionally distinct samples
from individual meningiomas (Aim 1), patient-matched meningioma samples over time (Aim 2), and an organoid
model of meningioma heterogeneity integrated with a novel functional genomic technique (Aim 3).
 Our central hypothesis is that understanding how meningiomas grow and respond to therapy will (1) identify
drivers underlying meningioma biomarker performance to optimize risk stratification, (2) define magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging features of meningioma biomarkers to establish a foundation for non-invasive risk
stratification, and (3) inform future therapies to improve the care of patients with the most common primary
intracranial tumor. Our studies will use bulk, single-cell, spatial, and functional genomics to investigate
meningioma evolution and heterogeneity in the context of intratumor or whole tumor MR imaging features. To
do so, we have assembled a biobank 367 patient-matched meningioma samples from 156 patients who were
treated with serial surgery ± radiotherapy, 27 patient-derived meningioma cell lines that represent all DNA
methylation groups, and completed genome-wide CRISPRi screens to identify genetic dependencies underlying
meningioma response or resistance to cell cycle inhibitors and radiotherapy."
10934267,"PROJECT 4: PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to improve the management of patients with primary brain tumors by utilizing
innovative hyperpolarized carbon-13 MR imaging techniques. These techniques use non-toxic and non-
radioactive metabolites to dynamically image metabolic pathways in a matter of seconds. Our team has made
significant progress in acquiring, processing, analyzing, and interpreting hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI during
the previous cycle. Our application in high-grade gliomas has also shown that hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate
MRI can uncover Warburg-related metabolic dysfunction and regional heterogeneity. Building on these results
and our experience in translating different hyperpolarized carbon-13 imaging probes clinically to image glioma
subtypes, we aim to challenge the current clinical practice paradigm through the use of dynamic metabolic
imaging as opposed to only anatomic imaging in the two most common types of primary brain tumors –
glioblastoma and meningioma in this project.
In Specific Aim 1, we will explore the impact of using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate to assess early metabolic
changes in patients with recurrent glioblastoma who are treated with novel therapeutic agents. Glioblastoma is
the most common malignant primary brain tumor, with a medium overall survival of 14-16 months. Developing
and applying noninvasive, easily acquired measures of the pharmacodynamic effect of novel agents in
glioblastoma can provide early evaluation of treatment response. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate newly
diagnosed patients with meningioma prior to surgical resection using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [1-
13C]alanine MRI. This will be used to identify meningioma DNA methylation groups, which have been shown to
be more robust classification systems with distinct clinical outcomes and biological drivers across WHO
grades. The development of noninvasive imaging techniques for improving risk stratification is a priority for
improving patient care. We believe that the results of this study will significantly enhance the management of
patients with brain tumors, providing clinicians with a better understanding of the metabolic changes in patients
and making early decisions about target modulation in early-phase clinical trials and treatment planning."
10933174,"This is the first competitive renewal of a T32 program to prepare postdoctoral trainees for
collaborative research careers in two inter-related topics: thrombosis and inflammation. There is
increasing evidence of a direct relationship between thrombosis and inflammation, or
thromboinflammation, in numerous human diseases. Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of
thrombotic disorders such as stroke and coronary artery disease, while thrombosis influences disease
severity in inflammatory conditions such as the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), sepsis,
autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Despite the close links between thrombosis and inflammation, to
our knowledge, this is the only T32 program in the nation focused specifically on both processes. The
Center for Translational Research on Inflammatory Diseases (CTRID) at Michael E. DeBakey VA
Medical Center and the Division of Thrombosis Research at Baylor College of Medicine sponsor this
collaborative training program with rigorous research opportunities and close mentoring by faculty.
The group of 19 faculty mentors includes 9 NIH-funded investigators and 7 VA Merit-funded
investigators; 11 of the mentors are physician-scientists and the balance are non-physician scientists.
The major strengths of our program include: 1) a cohesive and highly collaborative group of
successful mentors with research expertise in relevant topics for our program, including platelets,
neutrophils, microvascular thrombosis, stroke, cancer, sepsis, autoimmunity, inflammatory conditions
in lung, bone, and infection, among others; 2) a unique combined curriculum with shared didactic and
clinically- oriented training for physician and non-physician trainees; and 3) it is based in a thriving
research center committed to mentoring, including a weekly seminar series that consists of > 60%
speakers with scientific interests aligned with the themes of this T32. In addition to training physician-
scientists in biomedical research, PhD scientists will be trained in translational medicine offering a
direct interaction with patients with clinical conditions related to the focus of this T32. PhD trainees
are paired with physician trainees during these clinical practicums; this collaborative aspect of the
program teaches PhD postdoctoral fellows the importance and benefit of conducting research in
collaboration with physician-scientists and vice-versa. The program consists of 2-3 years of research
training, enriched by didactic courses, an outstanding seminar series and a vibrant scientific
environment. Successful renewal of this T32 on thrombosis and inflammation will continue to pave
the way for new biological insights and novel ways of prevention and treatment of thrombotic-
inflammatory disorders by educating future physician- and non-physician scientists for collaborative
research careers in thrombosis and inflammation."

10935604,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower grade gliomas, as well as the high grade gliomas that arise from them, are now diagnostically defined by
the presence of mutations in genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes. Mutant IDH enzymes
exhibit the neomorphic ability to synthesize the oncometabolite (R)-2HG. (R)-2HG accumulates to millimolar
levels in IDH-mutant glioma cells and competes with a structurally similar metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), for
binding to 2OG-dependent enzymes. These enzymes include dioxygenases that promote DNA and histone
demethylation. Consequently, (R)-2HG accumulation in IDH-mutant cells causes chromatin hypermethylation
and epigenetic reprogramming, ultimately leading to oncogenic signaling, a block in differentiation, and
malignant transformation. Recently, an inhibitor of mutant IDH (IDHi) oncoproteins, vorasidenib, was shown to
dramatically enhance progression-free survival of patients with grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma in a large-scale
multi-center phase 3 trial, setting the stage for promulgation of vorasidenib (and similar IDHi drugs) as new
“standard-of-care” therapies for these brain tumors. Patients in this study did, however, experience progression
on IDHi therapy, indicating that widespread use of these agents will create a new molecular brain tumor cohort:
post-IDHi recurrent IDH-mutant glioma. Developing new treatments tailored to the unique biology of this glioma
cohort is an emergent, unmet clinical need. Against this backdrop, our group has developed two treatment
strategies that hold promise for combating acquired resistance to IDHi therapy. These strategies seek to
exploit, rather than inhibit, mutant IDH activity by targeting synthetic lethal vulnerabilities conferred by the (R)-
2HG oncometabolite. We discovered that (R)-2HG accumulation sensitizes IDH-mutant glioma cells to
inhibitors of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis and NAD+ metabolism. These dependencies can be
targeted with orludodstat, an inhibitor of the pyrimidine synthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
(DHODH), or with temozolomide (TMZ) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor combination
therapy, respectively. Our central hypothesis is that these synthetic lethal treatments will serve as effective
second line therapies for IDH-mutant gliomas with IDHi acquired resistance. We will test this hypothesis
through three specific aims. In Specific Aim #1, we will create neurosphere, organoid, and genetically
engineered mouse models of IDH-mutant lower grade glioma with IDHi acquired resistance and use them to
test the antitumor activity of orludodstat. In Specific Aim #2, we will use these models and others to test the
impact of IDHi resistance on the antitumor activity of combined TMZ and PARG inhibitor therapy. In Specific
Aim #3, we will use primary samples from a window-of-opportunity trial of orludodstat in grade 2 IDH-mutant
glioma patients who have progressed on IDHi therapy to assess molecular markers of target engagement and
antitumor efficacy associated with this drug. If successful, these studies will nominate new treatment strategies
for patients with IDH-mutant glioma who have failed IDHi therapy and facilitate their clinical translation."
10943864,"Bereavement is highly prevalent among older adults, a rapidly growing demographic of the US population that
is projected to double by 2050. Estimates suggest that 3%- 10% of bereaved adults experience clinically
significant levels of prolonged grief disorder (PGD), with older adults at higher risk. Recognition, prevention,
and effective treatment of PGD is critical to reduce excess mortality among older adults, yet the capacity to
identify and refer cases has lagged because PGD has not historically been included in the major psychiatric
diagnostic manuals until the most recent editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
5th Edition Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). As a
result, it is only now possible to fill the historical knowledge gap around the prevalence and risk/protective
factors for this highly impairing condition. The long-term goal of our work is to ascertain and validate PGD case
status among older adults enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study and identify modifiable factors that improve
health outcomes for at-risk people. The central aim of this proposal is to use the unparalleled epidemiological
resources of three >30-year longitudinal studies to characterize prevalent PGD consistent with newly
introduced criteria in the DSM-5-TR for the first time in an ongoing cohort with exceptionally high response
rates. First, we will ascertain probable PGD case status among 91,630 older adults with >30 years of
prospective longitudinal data in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study (HPFS) and validate PGD case status among a randomly sampled bereaved subcohort of 27,115 adults.
We will test apriori hypotheses regarding prevalence: a) PGD increases with age; b) After adjusting for sex
differences in survival via inverse probability of censoring weighting, the prevalence of PGD does not
meaningfully differ by sex; and c) Inclusion of sex and age in models will improve accuracy, as quantified using
the mean absolute difference metric of model adequacy. Second, we will harness a novel data science
approach to identify risk factors associated with PGD based on more than 30 years of prospective longitudinal
data spanning biomarkers, genetics, psychosocial variables, and prior psychiatric history. Third, using a similar
analytic approach, we will identify protective factors guided by the NIH Common Fund-supported Science of
Behavior Change framework associated with reduced risk for PGD. Impact: The recent inclusion of PGD as a
diagnostic category in the DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 affords healthcare professionals an infrastructure to identify
and mobilize targeted bereavement-related services. The proposed project will address a gap in our
understanding of PGD among older adults, thus advancing NIMH Strategic Goal 2: Charting mental illness
trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene. Results will deliver insights into risk and
protective factors that can inform targeted primary prevention efforts for the millions of older adults currently at
risk of PGD."
10943866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biologically-grounded data-driven stratification of disease has revolutionized most of modern medicine. Yet,
psychiatric disorders—a major public health concern—are still defined strictly on the basis of subjective signs
and symptoms. Newly available large-scale human neurobiological data offer an unprecedented opportunity for
biologically-grounded data-driven stratification of psychiatric disorders. However, conventional data analytical
procedures are ill-suited for such investigations, and new computational approaches are needed. The goal of
this proposal is to develop and validate a novel computational framework for identifying, validating, and
characterizing biological subtypes of psychiatric disorders, and to apply the framework to the study of autism.
We aim to leverage newly available large-scale open-source human brain imaging, phenotypic and
transcriptomic data from consortia and repositories around the world, as well as data we have acquired at
Stanford University, combined with our recent work in brain circuit analysis and modeling methods and
advances in machine learning. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and
validate novel computational methods to extract individual-level neural fingerprint, in particular brain circuit
dynamics, using human brain imaging data. In Aim 2, we will develop analytical procedures to stratify
psychiatric disorders using neural fingerprints and apply the procedures to identify and validate biological
subtypes of autism. In Aim 3, we will perform integrative analysis to determine the transcriptomic signatures of
the identified biological subtypes, using neural fingerprints and human brain gene expression data. The
proposed work is highly relevant to the strategic plan of the NLM to accelerate discovery and advance health
through data-driven research. Through the successful completion of the work described here, the proposed
studies will add new knowledge to our current understanding of the etiology of autism and, crucially, provide a
new computational framework for improved stratification of other psychiatric disorders. Ultimately, these
advances will lead to better diagnosis and more effective treatments for psychiatric disorders and, more
broadly, advance precision medicine."
10939464,"Abstract of the proposed research that shows the relevance to AD/ADRD
Chronic pain and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are common in older age and
emerging evidence links pain as a significant risk factor for subsequent cognitive decline and dementia. However,
the up-to-10-year preclinical phase of AD/ADRD with no objective cognitive deficits significantly limits the study
of pain’s potential impact on cognition, and once diagnosed, there are significant limitations assessing the
multidimensional pain experience using verbal reports. Given the complexity of chronic pain in aging, there are
likely a combination of mechanisms contributing to pain-cognitive decline interactions. Our own previous work
has demonstrated accelerated biological aging in persons with chronic pain including accelerated brain aging
using brain aging biomarkers known to predict cognitive decline and AD. Thus, the current study aims to
determine the association between brain tissue and blood-derived epigenetic aging biomarkers along with
determination of brain aging from the clinical MRIs within the same individual to further understand biological
aging interactions and potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms. The proposed research addresses a
significant gap in the literature and would be the first to evaluate pain-related differences in multi-tissue-derived
epigenetic aging and associations with brain aging biomarkers derived from clinical MRIs."

Covalent inhibitors of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) are effective in multiple B-cell malignancies but patients
discontinue these agents due to resistance and intolerance. Highly selective and reversible non-covalent BTK
inhibitors have been developed to overcome these problems and are currently being tested in clinical trials in
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell malignancies. Despite these beneficial
features of non-covalent BTK inhibitors and a high overall response rate seen in early clinical trials, some
patients did not respond to treatment or relapsed after initial response to monotherapy. This project’s broad
and long-term goals are to better understand these resistance mechanisms leading to relapse and design
better combination strategies or use of novel drugs to overcome this resistance. Our specific aims are to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of resistance to this novel class of BTK inhibitors by interrogating the
signaling pathways in mutant BTK cells that are kinase deficient. We plan to comprehensively evaluate the
dependence of kinase dead BTK mutations on potential surrogate kinases activated by mutant BTK. We are
also testing the requirement for BTK for survival and signaling in cells with PLCG2 mutations. Lastly, we will
identify the genomic basis for BTK degrader resistance. Given the widespread use of BTK inhibitors across
CLL and B-cell malignancies, and the increasing incidence of patients with acquired resistance to non-covalent
BTK inhibitors, the results of this study will have major therapeutic importance for patients with a variety of B-
cell malignancies. Our findings will inform future application of disease monitoring on non-covalent BTK
inhibitors and about the development of resistance mechanisms with BTK degraders that are now being used
in clinical trials."
10943031,"ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate blood and immune cells throughout life. However, aging HSCs
exhibit reduced self-renewal activity, diminished regenerative capacity, and myeloid-biased differentiation that
contribute to an increased incidence of immune dysfunction, bone marrow failure, anemia, clonal hematopoiesis,
and cancer in older adults. Translational control has emerged as fundamentally and preferentially important for
stem cells. Young adult HSCs have lower protein synthesis rates than other hematopoietic cells and increases
in protein synthesis impair HSC function by increasing the biogenesis of misfolded proteins and disrupting protein
homeostasis (proteostasis). In preliminary studies, we found that old HSCs preserve low protein synthesis rates,
but increase the biogenesis of misfolded proteins, raising the possibility that translation fidelity declines in HSCs
during aging and contributes to age-related HSC dysfunction by disrupting proteostasis. The goal of this proposal
is to test if young adult HSCs have elevated translation fidelity as compared to restricted progenitors and old
HSCs, and to determine if enhancing translation fidelity increases HSC fitness and longevity. To our knowledge,
translation fidelity has not yet been studied in a cell-type- or age-specific manner in vivo, and interventions that
specifically boost translation fidelity in mammals have not been reported. To overcome these limitations, we
developed a single cell assay to quantify relative translation fidelity, and developed a new genetic mouse model
with high-fidelity ribosomes (Rps23K60R) that enhances translation fidelity and reduces proteostasis stress in
aging HSCs. In Aim 1, we will use translation fidelity reporter mice to quantify relative translation fidelity in HSCs
and progenitors in vivo, and will determine if genetically or environmentally increasing protein synthesis reduces
fidelity in HSCs. Furthermore, we will test if enhancing translation fidelity in Rps23K60R mice protects HSCs from
the proteostasis disrupting effects associated with increased protein synthesis. In Aim 2, we will test if translation
fidelity declines in HSCs during aging, and if enhancing fidelity delays/mitigates age-related declines in HSC
function. We will also determine if enhancing translation fidelity delays/prevents stem cell exhaustion in serial
transplantation assays and extends organismal healthspan and lifespan. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the
effects of enhancing translation fidelity on proteostasis using a suite of single cell assays to investigate proteome
quality and quantitative proteomics to investigate proteome content throughout life. We will also test if enhancing
fidelity alleviates the need to activate proteotoxic stress response pathways to preserve HSC fitness during
aging. These studies will elucidate if cell-type-specific differences in translation fidelity are employed to confer
stem cell longevity and will reveal if modulating translation fidelity is a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance
stem cell fitness and organismal longevity by preventing age-related proteostasis disruption. Overall, this work
will open new directions for extending human healthspan and longevity."
10941900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ability to remember one's own features and monitor the current states is a fundamental for self-
recognition. To experimentally demonstrate the visual self-recognition, a mirror-induced visual self-recognition
(MSR) test was developed for non-human primates, which requires animals to remember visual features of
their own heads as a reference memory and recognize the current status via a mirror reflection. Human brain
imaging and electrophysiological studies have suggested several brain regions potentially important for visual
self-recognition. Especially, prefrontal cortex (PFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus (HPC)
are currently considered to be crucial for visual self-recognition. However, how neurons, circuits and inter-
regional network activity in the brain accomplish this remarkable function remains unknown, due to a limited
availability of experimental animal models. Although the ability of MSR was initially reported in only few
species, by modifying the experimental conditions to adjust to their nature, birds, fishes and rhesus macaques
were also able to show MSR, suggesting that MSR may present in many more species than previously
thought. Our goal is to examine the neural circuit mechanisms for MSR using a mouse model, focusing on
how mice remember visual features of the self and recognize the current status via a mirror reflection.
 Our recent studies indicate that mice display mark-directed head-grooming to remove ink stains on
their heads only when a mirror is visibly available. This mark-directed behavior requires long-term mirror
habituation and social experience in the home cage. Our preliminary study with whole-brain neural activity
mapping using immediate early gene expression revealed that both the medial PFC (mPFC) and HPC are
activated during MSR in mice, suggesting that these brain regions involved in MSR are preserved across
species. We found that chemogenetic inhibitions of ventral HPC impair MSR. Specifically, a subset of ventral
hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) neurons is highly reactivated during exposure to a mirror, but not to other
conspecifics, and is crucial for MSR in mice. We refer to these as self-responding neurons. Based on our
preliminary data, previous human studies, and anatomical connections, our central hypothesis is that
hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuits may be crucial for MSR. In particular, we posit the conceptual
framework that the visual self-image may be developed and stored in a subset of vCA1 neurons through
social experiences and mirror habituation, while mPFC may facilitate visual self-monitoring for MSR by
integrating the visual self-image from vCA1. To test these hypotheses, we will examine i) the roles of vHPC
and mPFC neural activity on MSR (Aim 1), ii) the roles of self-responding vCA1 neurons on MSR (Aim 2) and
iii) the roles of vCA1→mPFC pathway on MSR (Aim 3). We believe our proposed study is highly adventurous,
because it will provide a first demonstration of the detailed functional map of the hippocampal-prefrontal
cortical circuit that controls visual self-recognition."

IRACDA@TAMU is a partnership between Texas A&M University (TAMU), a historically white R1 university that
has recently achieved the status of a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU),
an HBCU that has recently achieved the status of an R2 university. By adopting community-based mentoring
models that emerged from Hispanic and Black communities, TAMU and PVAMU faculty from groups
underrepresented in the biomedical workforce developed the Research-Intensive Community model as an
alternative to the traditional 1-on-1 mentoring model. Leveraging the sustainability of multilevel mentoring and
the productivity of diverse undergraduate research teams, this model fully integrates research, education, and
leadership to train participants, produce research, and transform institutions. We will pursue four objectives to
form a unique postdoctoral training program: 1) Prepare Scholars to initiate a research program and develop
technical and operational skills by working with faculty research mentors. In Year 1, Scholars, guided by both
research and instruction mentors, observe PVAMU classes and work in TAMU labs to lay the foundation for an
adaptable research program that can be deployed in both research- and teaching-intensive institutions. 2)
Prepare Scholars to sustain a research program that integrates high-impact teaching practices into the lab
by leading undergraduate research teams. In Year 2, Scholars join the IRACDA Research Leadership Program
and learn to amplify their research productivity by effectively leading diverse undergraduate research teams. 3)
Prepare Scholars to sustain a teaching program that integrates research projects into the classroom by
teaching inclusive course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). In Year 3, Scholars continue in
the IRACDA Research Leadership Program and learn to establish CUREs at PVAMU that sustains their research
and expands research capacity of their instruction mentors. 4) Prepare Scholars to establish and direct
research education programs that cultivate inclusive, safe, and supportive research-intensive communities. In
Year 4, Scholars join the IRACDA Directors Program and learn to direct scalable research leadership programs
that bridge institutions. By the end of the grant period, 12 IRACDA Scholars will have gained the technical,
operational, and professional skills to become independent academics that develop sustainable research
platforms at either research- or teaching-intensive institutions. They will have become highly sought-after change

Caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorders often recall differences in their children as early as
infancy, despite most children with autism being diagnosed after age 3. Caregiver recall of behavioral
differences in infancy indicates that there is more to learn from the earliest developmental periods of children
later diagnosed with autism that could ultimately contribute to earlier screening and earlier interventions.
Understanding the prodromal period could identify sources of heterogeneity in autism phenotypes, such as
social communication deficits and delayed language, which are highly variable and predictive of long-term
outcomes in the autism population. Investigating emerging communication processes is an important domain
to focus on in early development. Infant cries are part of the earliest communicative exchanges for humans.
Cry characteristics impact caregiver perceptions and responses to their infants and thus may impact early
communication development. Differences in cry acoustics associated with later autism diagnoses have been
observed as early as 6 months, and caregivers have perceived autism-related differences in cries from
infants as young as 1-month of age. These findings support cry acoustics as an early risk marker of autism.
Aim 1 will replicate and extend the association between caregiver cry perception and autism outcomes to
aid in identification of the objective acoustic features driving the perceptual differences , requiring collection
of new caregiver ratings of cries from an existing library. Aim 2 will consist of detailed analysis of existing
daylong recordings to capture a phenotype of social contingency development through analysis of caregiver-
infant turn-taking involving cry over the first 12 months of life. The project will utilize recordings collected at
1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in children with and without autism. In addressing these aims and preparing for a
career as an independent investigator, the PI will be trained in three primary areas: 1) the autism spectrum
disorder phenotype and clinical knowledge, 2) measurement and data analysis relevant to prospective
longitudinal studies of developmental disorders and developmental trajectory phenotypes, and 3)
professional development, especially focused on training in grant writing and presenting research to multiple
academic disciplines and stakeholders. The research projects and training plan leverage the sponsor and
co-sponsor’s existing data (cry recordings and daylong recordings collected longitudinally), expertise in
autism and infant cry (sponsor) and statistical analysis (co-sponsor), experience in training and mentoring
(sponsor and co-sponsor), and the PIs strong foundation of research experience and commitment to multi-
disciplinary research of atypical language acquisition."
10943071,"ABSTRACT
 Child and adolescent behavioral health problems are related to the leading causes of youth morbidity and
mortality and are costly to society. Parent-focused interventions effectively prevent behavioral health problems
such as depression and conduct disorders and can provide an economic benefit to society. Unfortunately,
parenting programs are not widely available, not accessible, nor well-attended. Pediatric primary care is a non-
stigmatizing setting with nearly universal reach and, therefore, an ideal access point to increase access.
However, primary care clinicians (PCCs) often have insufficient training in behavioral health topics and typical
referral practices are often inadequate. There are also logistical barriers to attending in-person parenting
programs, like the need for childcare and a large time-commitment. There is a need to develop effective
referral practices in conjunction with increasing the accessibility of parenting programs. Our long-term goal is
to prevent significant behavioral health problems through widespread access to effective and accessible
parenting programs through primary care referrals. Previously, we successfully developed and pilot tested a
brief training for PCCs that we call Support & Guide (S&G). S&G training provides a communication strategy
for engaging parents in a conversation about parenting and for making referrals. We also successfully pilot
tested a brief, online parenting intervention based on GenerationPMTO, called Empowered Generations
(eGen); eGen is a six-session parent training program provided by therapists via video chat online to parents
with a child between the ages of 3-8 years. S&G training and eGen were both found to be feasible and
acceptable, and both demonstrated promise of effectiveness. Significantly, all clinical aspects of the study have
been conducted in real-world settings and systems and are highly pragmatic. In the proposed R01, we will
build on the knowledge gained through the R34 to conduct fully powered randomized trials. The secondary
objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of brief PCC S&G training. The primary objective of this
project is to test the effectiveness and cost-benefit of eGen. The study design includes two parallel randomized
controlled trials (RCT). In the S&G RCT, we will randomize PCCs (aim 1); in the eGen RCT we will randomize
parents (aim 2). These two trials are linked by the fact that the parents referred by PCCs in aim 1 are the same
parents who are invited to participate in the aim 2 eGen trial. In addition, we will examine the cost benefit of
eGen (aim 3) when implemented with community therapists and with a real-world, primary-care-referred
sample of parents. This research is significant because it simultaneously addresses the need to develop
effective referral practices in conjunction with increasing the accessibility of parenting programs. The
innovative design in this study captures the entire patient flow from initial engagement to outcomes and
operates within real-world systems and documents the potential return on investment for payors and society."
10942226,"Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the major cardiac cell type responsible for producing extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins, forming a structural scaffold crucial for supporting cardiac tissue during development and homeostasis.
CFs are also known for their high plasticity, enabling them to swiftly respond to injuries and pathological
conditions. Under such circumstances, CFs are rapidly activated and become transdifferentiated into
myofibroblasts that produce and secrete an excessive amount of ECM components, ultimately leading to fibrotic
scarring that disrupts tissue compliance and accelerates the progression toward heart failure.
 The transformation of CFs into myofibroblasts requires wholesale programming of the CF transcriptome. Yet,
in addition to transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has
emerged as a critical regulatory layer for controlling gene expression. RBPs actively regulate every step of mRNA
life cycle, including splicing, stability, and translation. In our preliminary studies, we found that one of RBPs,
Ybx1, was significantly upregulated during CF to myofibroblast conversion and further discovered a potentially
important role of this RBP in myofibroblast formation. Specifically, we found that Tcf21:MerCreMer mediated
ablation of Ybx1 inhibits the transformation of CFs into myofibroblasts and reduces cardiac fibrosis.
 While the conversion CFs to myofibroblasts is inherently pathological, the extensive pool and plasticity of
resident CFs has been recently harnessed for cardiac regeneration whereby CFs are reprogrammed into induced
cardiomyocytes (iCMs) by local delivery of three cardiac transcription factors (TFs) - Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5
(abbreviated as GMT). Building upon our intriguing finding that depletion of Ybx1 attenuates CF to myofibroblast
conversion and reduces cardiac fibrosis, we posed the question whether Ybx1 ablation enhances GMT-mediated
iCM reprogramming. Indeed, our preliminary study indicates that, compared to MGT-mediated iCM
reprogramming, delivery of GMT with Ybx1 depletion enhances iCM induction, further attenuating cardiac fibrosis
and improves heart function following MI.
 Combining these two lines of investigation and the corresponding preliminary data, in this proposal we will
leverage our series of unique tools, reagents, and animal models to address our hypothesis that Ybx1 activity
exerts a significant influence on the fate switch involving CFs, specifically the transformation of CFs into
myofibroblasts and the reprogramming of CFs into iCMs, which can be leveraged for reducing fibrotic scarring
and regenerating lost myocardium after MI."
10943493,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the significance of emerging infectious diseases for human health and
security. Bats have been associated with high-profile viral emergence events, including SARS-CoV-2 (the
causative agent of COVID-19), ebolaviruses, and a variety of zoonotic and almost invariably lethal lyssaviruses.
While much recent research has investigated virus diversity in bats, it is largely unknown how infection processes
in bats and their behavior shape virus exposure risk for other species. Exposure is the obligatory first step for
pathogen spillover and one of the strongest points for intervention in the process leading to the emergence of
new human diseases. Further, bat displacements are commonly used to mitigate human risks posed by bat-
borne viruses in low-income settings. Yet, how displacements and other perturbations affect viral exposure and
spillover risk is not known, largely because the necessary longitudinal monitoring is rarely undertaken and is
frustrated by challenges of appropriate controls and monitoring rare viruses in difficult to capture animals. This
project will focus on three important and unusually tractable host-virus systems: coronaviruses, rabies virus, and
Bombali ebolavirus in their wild bat hosts in Taita Hills, Kenya and Orange Walk, Belize. We will use a
combination of longitudinal monitoring, bat behavior studies, and field experiments to examine how virus
shedding dynamics in bat populations and bat use of anthropogenic structures shape virus exposure risk for
humans and domestic animals that can act as intermediate hosts. To explore generalizability across viruses and
assess whether perturbation triggers the shedding of latent viruses, we will further use proteomic and
metagenomic approaches to characterize stress and immunological responses to perturbations and measure
viral diversity shifts at a community level. Our multidisciplinary approach will confront field-collected virus
serological, shedding, and sequence data with competing epidemiological models to elucidate fundamental
principles driving viral infection and shedding from bats (aim 1); employ anthropogenic roost selection and use
surveys to identify local- and landscape-level areas where human encounters with bats and virus are greatest
(aim 2); and conduct controlled experimental displacements of wild bats through roost evictions to quantify the
responses of bat stress, immunity, and viral communities to this common occurrence (aim 3). Together, these
studies will represent an unusually comprehensive and detailed investigation into the dynamics of viruses in wild
bat populations and provide a critical advance towards evidence-based risk evaluation and prevention."
10934266,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT ABSTRACT
Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. Integrated genomic, epigenomic and
proteomic analyses of patient biopsies have identified biological groups of meningiomas with distinct clinical
outcomes and molecular drivers. Merlin-intact meningiomas have the best outcomes with the least risk of
recurrence and are distinguished by expression of the tumor suppressor NF2. Immune-enriched tumors undergo
loss of NF2 and have an intermediate risk of recurrence. NF2 loss combined with expression of the transcription
factor FOXM1 is observed in aggressive hypermitotic tumors with the highest risk of recurrence. Identifying
biomarkers of NF2 loss, alone or combined with FOXM1 expression, has the potential to enable non-invasive
stratification of meningioma patients according to their risk of recurrence.
Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including NF2 and FOXM1, rewire cellular metabolism in a manner
that can be non-invasively visualized by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 1H-MRS quantifies steady-
state metabolite concentrations and is in clinical use. Hyperpolarized 13C-MRS enables in vivo imaging of
dynamic metabolic activity and is in clinical trials in brain tumor patients. In combination, 1H- and hyperpolarized
13C-MRS provide a comprehensive view of the metabolic state of tumor tissue in vivo. Our preliminary studies in
isogenic models identify NF2 and FOXM1 driven differences in amino acid, glucose, and phospholipid
metabolism that can be interrogated using 1H-MRS, hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate and hyperpolarized [1-13C]-
alanine. Based on these studies, we propose to identify 1H-MRS (Aim 1) and HP 13C-MRS (Aim 2) biomarkers
of NF2 loss and FOXM1 expression in patient-derived meningioma cells, tumor xenografts, and patient biopsies.
We will then mechanistically validate our metabolic biomarkers by delineating the molecular pathways that link
NF2 and FOXM1 to meningioma metabolism (Aim 3).
Our studies are innovative because we will, for the first time, leverage metabolic reprogramming for non-invasive
imaging of meningiomas. Our proposal is significant because our biomarkers have the potential to non-invasively
discriminate between clinically relevant molecular groups of meningiomas. By doing so, they will provide
physicians with the ability to determine whether an individual patient’s tumor is likely to recur and tailor the
treatment plan accordingly. In essence, our studies will enable precision imaging that has the potential to
enhance outcomes and quality of life for meningioma patients."
10932560,"Urologic cancers impose a significant burden on the health of Americans. In 2023, an estimated 68,000
individuals will die from cancers that fall under a urologist’s care, a figure that accounts for 11% of all cancer
mortality. These numbers are expected to rise over the next decades as the overall population ages. At the
same time, the pace of innovation and discovery in translational science and health services research in the
area of cancer continues to accelerate. These combined factors require a well-prepared, research-oriented
work force that is capable of asking and answering clinically relevant scientific questions that have potential to
be translated into impactful discoveries. A number of sources suggest that today, only a small fraction of
urologic surgeons possess such skills. The primary goal of this T32 renewal application is to prepare urology
trainees for an academic career in urologic oncology by providing a comprehensive training program
comprised of mentored training options in either translational laboratory science or health services research.
Investigative themes of the program will be based on the research focus and expertise of a group of multi-
disciplinary externally funded faculty members in the Rogel Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of
Michigan and composed of individuals from the Departments of Urology, Internal Medicine, Pathology, Surgery
and Pharmacology- all in the University of Michigan Medical School as well as faculty from the University of
Michigan School of Public Health. This proposal is a renewal application to train 4 postdoctoral fellows per
year. The major objective of our Advanced Training in Urologic Oncology program is to prepare individuals for
research and teaching careers in the field of academic Urologic Oncology. Graduating urology residents having
an M.D. or M.D./PhD. degree will be eligible. The program is structured around a research project supervised
by both research and methods mentors as well as an interactive and informative conference series and a
required core curriculum that includes specific graduate level courses that may lead to a Master’s degree.
Each trainee will choose between 1 of 2 tracks: translational laboratory science or health services research.
The goals of the program are to ensure that trainees: 1) design, implement, analyze and report a research
project, 2) obtain formal instruction on fundamental research methods and 3) gain instruction on either
fundamental principles of cancer biology (translational science track) or essential elements of conducting
health services research (health services track). There will be a special emphasis on formulating and testing
hypotheses that address clinically important questions. Additional training in the effective communication of
scientific results as well as grant preparation will be provided to all trainees. The long-term goal of our program
is to prepare trainees for independent careers in academic urologic oncology."
10928505,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Half of adolescents with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) do not take medications regularly as
prescribed. Non-adherence increases the risk of uncontrolled disease and poor health outcomes. Non-
adherence to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a highly effective medication recommended for nearly all patients
with pSLE, is especially difficult to identify due to the poor predictive performance of available measures. To
identify and ultimately reduce HCQ non-adherence in pSLE, I propose to: 1) use pharmacokinetic model
simulations to define an HCQ concentration cutoff as an objective measure of non-adherence; 2) develop a
novel, patient-facing digital intervention that delivers personalized feedback on HCQ concentrations to promote
taking HCQ as prescribed; and 3) test feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention in 25 adolescents
with pSLE. Results will provide a non-adherence cutoff that will be immediately useful to identify non-
adherence in clinical care. Results will also generate preliminary data to plan a larger efficacy trial designed to
reduce non-adherence. The Mentored Career Development Award will provide the dedicated time, structured
training, and mentorship required to advance my existing clinical pharmacology, analytic, and trial skills and
develop new skills in digital interventions. My overarching career goal is to optimize therapeutics to improve
health outcomes in pSLE and other pediatric rheumatic diseases using patient-centric methods. By completing
the proposed research and training plans within the world-class research environment at Duke, I will acquire
the skills and experience necessary to apply for independent funding and launch an academic research career
dedicated to optimizing treatment and improving health outcomes in pediatric rheumatic diseases."

Continuing funds are requested by 18 vision scientists (holding 20 eligible NEI R01 grants) and their
personnel to support three resource cores and an administrative core in the merged Department of
Ophthalmology, Visual and Anatomical Sciences (former Ophthalmology and Anatomy/Cell Biology (two)
Departments). The Tissue Culture/Molecular (TC/M) core will be directed by Dr. Jena Steinle, an R01-funded
investigator with significant expertise in tissue culture and molecular biology techniques. Together with the PI,
and a research assistant, the environment and capability to conduct vision research at Wayne State University
and affiliated institutions will be enhanced through prioritization of the work of NEI R01 funded investigators,
their staff and students (graduate and fellows) in numerous aspects of both tissue culture and molecular
biology. The TC/M core will provide vision scientists (priority for NEI R01 funded) with facilities and technical
assistance that will assure quality and cost effectiveness of the work performed. This core will maintain and
propagate ocular and other cell types, as well as provide investigators with genotyping, reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction (RT) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q)-PCR, gene silencing-siRNA,
shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, nested PCR and adherence assays. It will also provide for consultation on
recombinant (r) AAV virus vector use (at no cost) and advice to the PI, students or staff for in vitro functional

Identifying brainstem oscillators and other low-level mechanisms controlling tongue and jaw
movements
All vertebrate species depend on feeding for survival. Like breathing, feeding behaviors such as licking and
chewing involve rhythmic actions that are thought to be generated by central oscillators located in the brainstem.
However, the anatomical locations and the identity of feeding oscillator(s) remain poorly defined. We previously
successfully delineated the rodent whisking oscillator at the molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological,
functional, and mechanical levels. With all the techniques required to comprehensively investigate brainstem
circuits in vivo during orofacial behaviors fully established, here we will explore the low-level neural mechanisms
controlling feeding, especially licking, movements. Based on exciting preliminary studies, we will test the
hypothesis that separate but coordinated neurons/circuits in the brainstem control different aspects of feeding
including rhythmicity, amplitude/direction, and tongue shape.
The goals of Project 3 are: (1) to molecularly, physiologically, and functionally delineate the brainstem
premotor licking oscillator and amplitude controlling neurons; (2) to determine the interactions of premotor licking
oscillator and amplitude controlling neurons during licking vs chewing behaviors; (3) to reveal the neural
mechanisms involved in switching the modes of tongue/jaw movement patterns during licking vs chewing; and
(4) to determine the function of intralingual parasympathetic neurons in regulating tongue shape and physiology.
Results from Project 3 will generate experimental data for models in Project 2, and also test predictions derived
from Projects 1 and 2. Project 3 will also provide the key brainstem substrates to dissect how descending control
signals interact with brainstem nodes to drive flexible orofacial behaviors in Projects 1, 4, and 5."
10932678,"The mechanism underlying neuronal hyperexcitability, as a result of excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance, leading
to cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not fully understood and effective approaches to prevent
or reverse memory deficits are unavailable. Our multimodal MRI connectomics demonstrated a hyperexcitation
connectome phenotype in healthy women ApoE4 carriers as they age, raising the possibility that at least some
sex differences in AD may be explained by E4 female carrier-specific neuronal hyperexcitation. In support of
this, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F revealed higher
interhemispheric functional connectivity in the hippocampus of female mid-life mice. Further, we observed
reduced functional anisotropy, altered myelin and oligodendrocyte count, and importantly, altered transcription
phenotype of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus of these female mice. The antiseizure drug
Levetiracetam (LEV) is currently being tested in human trials, with early data suggesting that it does improve
cognition in those with signs of hyperexcitability. However, there is conflicting information concerning the efficacy
of the drug and its mechanism is not fully understood. This collaborative, multidisciplinary MPI program is aimed
at unraveling the efficacy of LEV in humans and mouse models by leveraging expertise in computational and
experimental neuroscience. We will test the hypothesis that hyperexcitability is more prevalent both in ApoE4
woman carriers and in female FAD-linked APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F and LOAD-linked ApoE4 knockin mice and that
LEV treatment will normalize hyperexcitability and cognitive deficits in a sex-dependent manner. In the
R21 Phase, the experimental approach will establish feasibility of LEV treatment in APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F female mice.
The computational approach will develop new biophysically - informed computational framework for modeling
experimental mouse data. In the R33 Phase, we will establish the effect of LEV on hyperexcitability and pathology
in association with sex, ApoE4 and amyloidosis, and generalize our computational approaches from mouse
hippocampus to the entire brain to characterize the whole-brain biophysical parameters of E-I balance in AD with
or without LEV treatment. The results of this program will provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of
E-I and LEV, and its therapeutic value in AD."
10931834,"ABSTRACT
Genomic epidemiology is crucial to outbreak surveillance and response. Sequencing data lets us track virus
evolution in real time to characterize transmission chains, identify emerging variants, and predict future spread.
This information, which cannot be deduced from diagnostic testing alone, can signal the presence of an outbreak
before it becomes a pandemic. To inform corrective action from sequencing data, results must be obtained within
hours, instead of days. The biggest bottleneck to wider adoption of sequencing in distributed settings is sample
and library preparation.
Ideally, automated library prep would be achieved with an easy-to-use, single button device that can be deployed
in resource-limited settings as part of a point-of-need infectious disease surveillance/diagnostic system.
However, given the diversity of sequencing applications, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution to library
prep. Instead, we believe the correct strategy is to automate unitary library prep operations, with well-defined
breakpoints in between, enabling the user to mix and match these operations as the application demands. This
strategy will reduce hands-on time and operator burden while maintaining workflow flexibility.
Phase I of this project demonstrated feasibility of automating three library prep operations on the platform, and
compatibility with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. In Phase II, Redbud Labs will automate these
unitary operations on the NAxtract platform and validate NGS performance on both Illumina and Oxford
Nanopore platforms. Our solution will eliminate approximately 95% of pipette steps from the workflow. At the
conclusion of this project, the platform will be ready for early-access testing in fieldable sequencing
environments, including high-containment public health labs and overseas disease surveillance interventions."
10933332,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER MODELING SHARED RESOURCE
The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Cancer Modeling Shared Resource (CMSR) has
developed into an essential translational research resource for Sylvester members. The aims of the CMSR are
to 1) develop novel mouse models of human cancer; 2) validate cancer targets and test potential therapeutic
approaches using those models; 3) characterize cancer models and evaluate treatment responses using
noninvasive imaging; 4) provide histopathological analysis; and 5) offer training and consultation. In 2017,
Daniel Bilbao, PhD, MBA, was recruited to Sylvester to develop the infrastructure needed to support preclinical
and translational studies, using the mouse as a model organism. One and a half years later, the CMSR was
established as a developing Shared Resource (SR). Driven by the success of the CMSR in achieving metrics
comparable to other CCSG-supported Sylvester SRs (in terms of usage, scope of services, and publications
and grants supported), the CMSR is now proposed as a full CCSG-supported SR. CMSR services facilitate the
in vivo modeling of human cancers, including Sylvester priority cancers, such as hematological and
gastrointestinal malignancies and hormone-related cancers, providing high-quality preclinical data for
successful drug development or evaluation of novel treatment protocols. CMSR’s growth and success are
driven by the Center-wide interest in translational research, significant Sylvester investment in imaging and
other sophisticated instrumentation, and continued expansion in the services provided by the talented CMSR
team. Over the current reporting period (6/1/2018-5/31/2023), to meet the needs of Sylvester members, the
CMSR expanded its services by acquiring 21 instruments, including six new state-of-the-art imaging and
histology platforms (e.g., 9.4T MRI, PET/CT, and automated IHC) and providing numerous new services. This
led to a more than doubling in the number of members using the facility annually, from 28 members in FY19 to
63 in FY23 (Sylvester’s fiscal year (FY) runs 6/1-5/31). To support this growth in services, CMSR staff
increased from three to 13 personnel, and the facility’s space expanded 2.8-fold, to 3,662 sq ft. Over the
reporting period, the CMSR provided services to 83 Sylvester members from all four Research Programs, who
comprised 87% of total usage by revenue, reflecting CMSR services’ critical importance to members. CMSR
supported 37 cancer-related publications, including 19 in high-impact journals (JIF≥10), and 35 cancer-related
grants awarded to members, including 11 from the NCI. Future plans include expanding mouse modeling with
gene editing services; enhancing histopathology services related to digital pathology; expanding noninvasive
imaging protocols for tumor detection and therapeutic responses; and expanding coordinated multi-SR support
for translational research."

Pore-forming membrane channels are central mediators of many complex biological phenomena; such as
synchronizing the contraction of our heart and electro-chemical signals in our brain, and detecting light, sound,
touch, taste and smells of the world around us. This ability is dependent upon dynamic mechanism used to
spatially and temporally modulate their cellular activity. Our research group is focused on understanding how
these types of phenomena are choreographed by remarkably complex strategies of cell-to-cell communication,
through the gap junctions. We aim to develop a molecular and atomic-level of mechanistic understanding of
how gap junctions coordinate inter-cellular communication. To achieve this level of detail, we are combining
the unique power of electron cryo-microscopy (CryoEM), together with computational modeling and targeted
biophysical and functional studies to address several fundamental questions, such as: i) How do the gap
junctions selectively control the flow of chemical information between cells? ii) How are their activities
allosterically modulated by physiological signals and pharmacological agents? iii) How gap junction assembly,
structure and function is coupled with the local lipid/cellular environment? Despite their physiological and
medical relevance, membrane proteins still only represent ~4% of the protein structure database. However,
recent advances in the field of high-resolution CryoEM, coupled with advancements in membrane protein
biochemistry and in situ imaging technologies, are beginning to revolutionize the way we structurally
characterize these proteins. With these tools in hand, we are addressing several key questions about gap
junction assembly, selectivity and regulation. The results of our investigations are expected to provide an
architectural framework and the mechanistic knowledge required for the rational development of targeted
therapies against a range of gap junction related diseases, such as blindness, deafness, arrhythmia, stroke
and cancers."
10933188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder experience depression at rates nearly twice that of their neurotypical
peers (20% vs. 11%). Untreated depression is associated with adverse short (e.g., school refusal) and long-term
outcomes (e.g., poor physical health, lower employment) that impair quality of life. Adolescents with autism also
face a 10x increase in the risk for premature death by suicide than their neurotypical peers. Risk factors to
depression in autism are not well understood and measurement efforts may be complicated by social
communication difficulties (i.e., autism symptomatology) that complicate adolescents’ efforts to identify and
explain emotional experiences to providers and family members. Therefore, more objective measures (e.g.,
electroencephalogram [EEG], specifically event-related potentials [ERPs]) may provide a better understanding
of risk factors to depression in adolescents with autism. Altered reward responsivity (Research Domain Criteria
[RDoC] Positive Valence) and disrupted social processes (RDoC Affiliation and Attachment) are key risk factors
to depression for neurotypical adolescents, but have not been investigated in autism. Clinical and neural
measures of social and nonsocial reward responsivity and associations with depression symptoms have not
been examined in autism, which may provide meaningful information about developmental trajectories.
Consistent with the NIMH Strategic Plan, Strategic Goal 2, “to identify and understand risk factors, biomarkers
and behavioral indicators of mental illness,” this K23 application aims to examine clinical and neural markers of
social and nonsocial reward responsivity and associations with depression symptoms in adolescents with autism,
including longitudinal investigations. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts in autism, depression,
reward responsivity, psychophysiological methods, and longitudinal and statistical methodologies, this proposal
will examine the predictive influences of these RDoC constructs to depression in adolescents 14-17 years old
with autism. Adolescence is a key developmental period for early detection and intervention as it is characterized
by spikes in depression prevalence and an increasing importance of peer relationships. Specifically, this proposal
will use EEG/ERP techniques and clinician-rated interviews to measure social and nonsocial reward responsivity
in adolescents with autism and test relationships with depression symptoms. Adolescents will be assessed one
year later to investigate how clinical and neural measures predict depression symptoms over time, which will
inform the developmental course of these RDoC constructs in this vulnerable population. The applicant’s long-
term goal is to understand the neurobiological and behavioral development of reward responsivity in autism and
associations with depression from adolescence to adulthood so as to inform screening methods and intervention
development. Mentored training will allow the applicant to gain expertise in multimethod measures (e.g., ERP
methodologies, clinician-rated interviews) and longitudinal design and analysis, with an emphasis on assessing
mechanisms associated with the onset, maintenance, and treatment of depression in autism."
10950532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key antecedent to CVD in patients with CKD. A primary mechanism of
endothelial dysfunction in CKD is a decline in the vasoprotective molecule nitric oxide (NO). Reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-related oxidative stress, a key source of which is mitochondria, mediates reductions
in NO bioavailability in CKD. Establishing new therapies to enhance NO bioavailability and lower ROS-related
oxidative stress to improve endothelial function in patients with CKD is a biomedical research priority.
Targeting the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway represents a promising approach for enhancing NO bioavailability
and improving endothelial function in CKD. I have shown in older adults without CKD that targeting the nitrate-
nitrite-NO pathway with inorganic nitrite (sodium nitrite) improves NO-mediated endothelial function. The
improvements are associated with changes in circulating factors in plasma that reduce endothelial cell total
and mitochondria-specific ROS bioactivity. Sodium nitrite also alters the plasma metabolome, and changes in
select metabolites with treatment are associated with lower plasma-induced endothelial cell ROS bioactivity.
To translate these findings to CKD, I am completing a randomized clinical trial testing the effects of 3 months of
treatment with nitrate-rich beetroot juice vs. placebo (nitrate-depleted beetroot juice) for improving endothelial
function in individuals with CKD (K01DK115524). My preliminary findings suggest that nitrate-rich beetroot
juice improves NO-mediated endothelial function. My preliminary results also suggest nitrate-rich beetroot
juice may change circulating factors in plasma to improve endothelial cell function, as shown by an
increased acetylcholine (ACh)-stimulated NO production and reduced ROS bioactivity in human aortic
endothelial cells (HAECs) exposed to plasma from subjects taken before/after active treatment vs. placebo.
The purpose of this R03 application is to leverage samples from my K01-supported clinical trial to show
changes in ‘circulating factors’ as a novel mechanism contributing to improvements in endothelial function
with nitrate-rich beetroot juice supplementation in patients with CKD and to identify the specific circulating
molecular transducers of the benefits of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on endothelial function in CKD.
Aim 1: To assess before/after 3 months of nitrate-rich beetroot juice or placebo (double-blind, randomized) in
men and women ≥50 years of age with stage II-IV CKD: i) ACh-stimulated NO production; and ii) total and
mitochondria-specific ROS bioactivity in HAECs exposed to plasma from subjects before/after the intervention.
Aim 2: a) To determine the effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on metabolites in plasma via targeted
metabolomics analysis of plasma samples taken before and after nitrate-rich beetroot juice treatment vs.

Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMVD) accounts for 30-50% of ischemic heart disease and leads to angina,
myocardial infarction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and cardiovascular death. It represents a
mismatch between blood supply, which can be affected by structural or functional abnormalities in the coronary
microvasculature, and cardiomyocyte demand for oxygen, which is largely driven by cardiac work and depends
on heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiomyocyte contractility. Despite its significant clinical burden, little is
known about the pathogenesis of CMVD, and there are no targeted therapies. In prior work, we identified a
variant in the Friend of GATA 2 (FOG2) coding sequence, FOG2S657G, which is associated with CMVD. In
preliminary studies using novel mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cell models of FOG2S657G, we
show that FOG2S657G increases expression of β1-adrenergic receptor. Our central hypothesis is that this
increased expression drives increased cardiac work, including heart rate and cardiomyocyte contractility, to
promote supply-demand mismatch and CMVD. Our objectives in this proposal are to obtain multiscale
preliminary transcriptional regulation and functional data to support an R01 application focused on
understanding the mechanism by which FOG2S657G may promote CMVD. Aim 1 is based on our preliminary
data which shows that MEF2 is the top transcription factor family mediating cardiac gene expression changes
due to FOG2S657G in vivo. We will determine the mechanism by which FOG2S657G increases ADR1B
expression. We will use transfection experiments, luciferase assays, and co-immunoprecipitation to define the
interactions between FOG2S657G and two key cardiac transcription factors, MEF2C and GATA4. In Aim 2, we
will establish the effects of FOG2S657G in regulating cardiac work, with a focus on heart rate and contractility,
and coronary blood flow. First, we will use the IonOptix contractility system (Westwood, MA) to measure
contractility in FOG2S657G iPSCs differentiated to cardiomyocytes relative to isogenic controls. We will measure
contractility in vivo using invasive pressure-volume loop measurements. Then, we will use implantable
telemetry to measure heart rate and blood pressure and echocardiography to assess cardiac morphology and
function in male and female mice with FOG2S657G. Finally, we will use novel SPECT imaging to measure
myocardial blood flow in cohorts of mice with and without FOG2S657G. The experiments outlined in this proposal
will help elucidate the relationship between FOG2S657G, increased β1-adrenergic receptor, and cardiac work.
This work is important because it will (1) give insight into mechanisms by which a human variant causes
CMVD, (2) help establish the role of adrenergic receptor signaling in CMVD and (3) give new insights into
disease pathogenesis and potentially driving future therapies."

Gene expression is tightly controlled at both the RNA and protein level by mechanisms involving chromatin
modification, transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, processing, translation and degradation. Each of these
processes are regulated by nucleic acid-protein interactions (DNA-protein and RNA-protein). Accordingly, there
have been tremendous efforts in the scientific community to comprehensively map these interactions, including
major international research efforts (e.g. ENCODE, RoadMap Epigenomics) focused on generating reference
maps for specific cell types. However, because these binding maps are highly specific for individual cell types,
there is a critical need to enable the generation of comprehensive genomic maps for any cell type of interest –
including primary cell types, disease models, or other rare cell populations – within an individual lab. This goal
remains challenging because existing assays can only map interactions of a single protein at a time and are
therefore prohibitively expensive.
To address these issues, this proposal will develop a highly innovative technology based on our split-pool
barcoding strategy (SPRITE) that maps multiway protein-nucleic acid interactions using high throughput
sequencing. The proposed Hi-P technology will be used to establish: (i) a highly multiplexed eCLIP-seq method
to map up to hundreds of RNA binding proteins simultaneously to their RNA binding sites, (ii) a highly multiplexed
ChIP-seq method to map up to hundreds of DNA binding proteins and histone modifications to their DNA binding
sites, and (iii) methods to map these multiple protein-nucleic acid interactions across many samples, among
these rare cell types, simultaneously.
The proposed technology represents a major advance – it will dramatically increase the scale of existing methods
and create new capabilities that are currently not possible. These tools will empower individual researchers to
generate detailed genomic datasets in specific biological and disease contexts that are comparable in size and
complexity to those generated by the ENCODE project at a tiny fraction of its cost. More generally, we anticipate
that these tools will lead to critical new insights into gene regulation and human disease."
10943239,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related progressive pathologic condition in aging men. More
than 50% of patients with BPH have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a condition affecting storage and
voiding. LUTS is evaluated in the clinic using a validated scoring system, IPSS (International Prostate Symptom
Score). High IPSS drives medical and surgical treatments. However, these treatments have variable efficacy
and unwanted side effects. The pathobiology of BPH is progressive hyperplasia and fibrosis in the transitional
zone (TZ) of the prostate with chronic inflammation as the major contributor. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a non-sulfated
glycosaminoglycan, (GAG) is causally linked to inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. We discovered that HA and
associated family members are highly elevated in BPH tissues from patients with high IPSS, regardless of the
prostate volume. The overall objective of this study is to examine the clinical significance of elevated HA in
BPH pathology and associated symptoms. Further, to test the efficacy of an orally bioavailable drug that inhibits
HA synthesis. This drug has an excellent safety profile for prolonged use. Consistent with HA’s role in
inflammation, tissues from patients with high IPSS showed heavy immune cell infiltration in a dense matrix, and
related mitogenic and fibrosis hallmarks. Mouse models of inflammation-induced prostate hyperplasia and
fibrosis mirrored the pattern of HA expression, and immune cell infiltration. Initial studies showed efficacy of the
HA-inhibiting drug in a mouse model. The project will test the hypothesis that HA mediates inflammation-induced
prostatic hyperplasia and fibrosis. Furthermore, its inhibitor effectively abrogates this pathology and improves
symptoms, with little toxicity. Further, IPSS can stratify patients with BPH to the HA-inhibiting treatment. We will
characterize HA and the related molecules from BPH tissues, investigate why HA is elevated in BPH tissues and
determine HA functions in ex-vivo cultures (Aim 1). Efficacy of the HA inhibitor to prevent/treat inflammation-
induced hyperplasia and fibrosis will be examined in mouse models, along with the evaluation of symptoms,
toxicity, and tissue/cell analyses (Aim 2). Clinical significance of HA and associated family will be evaluated in
BPH specimens to determine if their levels correlate with IPSS, while adjusting for clinical parameters (Aim 3).
Impact: This study should establish HA as a critical mediator of inflammation-induced prostatic hyperplasia,
fibrosis and associated voiding symptoms. Testing the efficacy of the HA-synthesis inhibitor in multiple models
and evaluating if IPSS can stratify patients with BPH to this treatment should aid in the repurposing of the drug
to treat BPH-related symptoms."

Due to the large, rural burden of HIV in the state, Alabama (AL) is one of seven priority states for the Ending the
HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative. Alabamians struggle with late HIV diagnosis and suboptimal linkage and retention
in HIV care, at least in part due to poverty, rurality, and lack of public health infrastructure and Medicaid
expansion. Further, historic events have impacted HIV efforts in AL in myriad ways, halting progress towards
EHE goals: the pandemic and the Drug Crisis. At UAB Hospital, one hundred of persons who inject drugs (PWID)
are hospitalized with serious complications from drug use annually. Over 25% of them are from rural counties
where the absence of low barrier medical, harm reduction, and addiction services enables high risk injection
practices and infections, like hepatitis C and HIV. Unfortunately, the hospital is a missed opportunity for HIV
prevention: we found that hospitalized PWID are unaware of their HIV risk and providers are unlikely to offer
PrEP to PWID. At the same time, few PWID in AL reside in communities that offer integrated HIV, harm reduction,
and addiction services. Thus, PWID with life-threatening complications of drug use return to communities who
are not equipped to care for them. While it is not feasible to rapidly scale up integrated care across Alabama, a
combination of geospatial mapping and epidemiologic surveillance can allow us to identify and prioritize counties
at greatest risk for an HIV outbreak among PWID. The objective of this application is to 1) leverage hospital and
community-level data to identify AL counties at greatest risk for an HIV outbreak among PWID and 2) engage
community partners to identify needs and opportunities to build community capacity. The overall goal of this
proposal is to inform implementation strategies to integrate person-centered HIV, harm reduction, and addiction
services for PWID in AL. To achieve our overall goal, we propose the following specific aims:
AIM 1A. Using geospatial mapping and statewide HIV and opioid overdose surveillance data, we will identify AL
counties with the greatest risk of an HIV outbreak during the contemporary drug crisis (fentanyl and
methamphetamines).
AIM 1B. Upon identifying counties with the greatest risk, we will work in partnership with our existing Community
Advisory Board (CAB) to develop an engaged community of partners in counties at greatest risk, including health
officials, AIDS Service Organizations, nonprofits, and addiction treatment centers.
AIM 2. We will collaborate with Community Partners to identify hyperlocal opportunities for integrated HIV, harm
reduction, and addiction services. Specifically, we will use qualitative methods to identify barriers and
opportunities for integrated care from the perspective of service organizations and PWID."

Intravital microscopy has been widely employed to visualize the structures and functions of cells in their natural
environment. However, the imaging depth of intravital imaging is constrained by tissue scattering. State-of-the-
art multiphoton microscopy can only produce sharp images up to about 1 mm deep in biological tissues at cellular
resolution, which restricts numerous biological applications requiring access deep inside tissues. Deep tissue
imaging faces two major challenges. First, the 3D refractive index of tissues, often referred to as the 'scattering
potential,' undergoes dynamic changes in living organisms. Second, the total light power for illuminating
biological tissue is limited to prevent thermal damage. Therefore, optical imaging techniques that are capable of
high-speed scattering correction and maximizing the light power at the focal plane are needed.
In this proposal, our group aims to develop innovative two-photon microscopy systems with scattering correction
for deep tissue imaging. The fundamental concept behind our techniques is coupling the illumination light into
high-transmission channels (referred to as 'open channels') within the scattering tissues while mitigating light in
the low-transmission channels. To achieve this goal, we will employ various techniques, encompassing
advancements in optical hardware and computational software. The hardware innovation is to develop high-
speed, high-efficiency light modulation, while the software innovation is to develop new deep-learning-based
algorithms for optimizing correction patterns and reducing computational complexity. Our proof-of-concept
experiments demonstrated a remarkable 27-fold increase in fluorescent intensity for imaging through a bone
sample after scattering correction. Our goal is to complete the entire correction process within 10 ms and achieve
a 100-fold increase in fluorescent signal after correction. We will validate our techniques by imaging intact mouse
organs. We will assess our techniques by comparing the image signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution with the
ground truth images obtained after tissue sectioning.
The novel two-photon microscopy techniques with scattering correction will enable deep tissue imaging at
previously unattainable depths while achieving cellular resolution. In the long term, we will collaborate with my
colleagues in the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Comprehensive Cancer Center at UC Davis to
apply the microscopy to broad biological research. This technique will facilitate the study of cellular structures
and activity within living organisms, such as neuronal activity deep in the brain, immune responses in the lymph
nodes, cancer metastasis, and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to memory and cognitive impairment.
Neuroinflammation has been identified as a prominent hallmark of AD. Neuroinflammation encompasses a
variety of inflammatory events. The process is marked by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. These dysregulated cytokines orchestrate with microglia, astrocyte
and neuronal cells and contribute to the accumulation of Ab and tau, and neuronal injury. Therefore, therapeutic
strategies that may intervein the neuroinflammation process hold significant promise for AD treatment.
Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) is a pluripotent anti-inflammatory cytokine that has long been
implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. TGFβ-SMAD signaling-mediated regulation occurs at the level of neuronal
survival and differentiation, microglia activation, amyloid production-distribution-clearance cycles, and
neurofibrillary tangle formation, all of which contributes to AD’s pathophysiology. Therefore, the TGFβ-SMAD
signaling represents a novel promising target for therapeutic innovation. However, there is no successful attempt
to reinstall the impaired TGFβ-SMAD signaling. Recently, we have identified a panel of novel small molecules
as molecular glues that can stabilize the SMAD3-SMAD4 transcriptional complex and thus activate the TGFβ-
SMAD signaling. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that these novel SMAD3-SMAD4 molecular glues can 1)
stabilize the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between SMAD4 and SMAD3, 2) activate SMAD3-SMAD4
transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays, 3) stimulate TGFβ-SMAD signaling target gene expression,
and 4) promote corresponding cellular phenotypes. Based on these strong scientific premises, we hypothesized
that the impaired TGFβ-SMAD signaling in AD patients can be reinstalled using novel SMAD3-SMAD4 molecular
glues, which could serve as innovative therapeutic strategy to re-establish TGFβ-mediated anti-inflammatory
milieu and mitigate AD pathological symptoms. We will determine the effect of SMAD3-SMAD4 molecular glues
in primary and human iPSC-derived microglia cells model (Aim 1) and in neuroblastoma and human iPSC-
derived neurons and organoids model (Aim 2). Accomplishing the proposed studies is expected to identify a
novel therapeutic strategy with SMAD3-SMAD4 molecular glues to reinstall the impaired TGFβ-SMAD signaling
in microglia and neuronal cells, and thus reset the neuro-immune homeostasis for AD patients."

Background and Goal: Nearly 90% children with cancer live in low- and middle-income countries, where survival
is as low as 20%. Children undergoing cancer treatment frequently develop critical illness, however, low-resource
hospitals face multiple challenges delivering high-quality pediatric onco-critical care (POCC), including limited
material and human resources. Additionally, hospitals in these settings face challenges implementing and
sustaining evidence-based interventions that improve outcomes for children undergoing cancer treatment.
Pediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) are evidence-based interventions that aid in early identification of
critical illness in children with cancer, resulting in improved survival. Although sustaining interventions like PEWS
is essential for ongoing impact on childhood cancer outcomes, little is known about how resource limitations
impact their ongoing use and sustainability. The goal of the proposed diversity supplement is to investigate how
POCC resources impact PEWS sustainability in resource-limited hospitals.
Aims and Methods: We will conduct an observational cross-sectional study of 36 resource-limited centers
participating in Proyecto EVAT, a collaborative of hospitals in Latin America implementing and sustaining PEWS,
and evaluate how POCC resources affect PEWS sustainability. We will measure POCC resources through
PROACTIVE (PediatRic Oncology cApaCity assessment Tool for IntensiVe care), a consensus derived tool to
assess the quality and capacity for POCC in resource-limited hospitals. During Aim 1: We will identify common
gaps in POCC resources among Proyecto EVAT centers and their perceived impact on PEWS sustainability.
During Aim 2: We will evaluate the relationship between POCC resources, clinical capacity for sustainability,
ongoing PEWS use, and patient outcomes.
Innovation and Impact: Determinants of sustainability for evidence-based interventions, including the role of
resources, are poorly understood. This study will advance the field of implementation science by enhancing our
understanding of how resources promote ongoing use of intervention like PEWS in low-resource settings by
leveraging a new measure (PROACTIVE). This work will contribute to the overall aim of the parent award
(R37CA276215-01, MPIs: Agulnik/McKay) to identify determinants of PEWS sustainability in these low-resource
hospitals and inform development of sustainability strategies suitable to a hospital’s resources. Findings from
this study will also assist hospitals to advocate for resources that promote sustainability of interventions that

This supplement complements our parent grant: NIDCD R21DC021275-01 “Investigating the origin and
functional properties of immune cells in noise-induced hearing loss”, and extends the original studies to include
the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hearing loss has been identified as one of eight risk
factors for AD by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and accounts for 8% of AD cases worldwide.
However, the pathological link between hearing loss and AD has not been established. It is not known whether
hearing loss leads to AD, or if hearing loss and AD share a common underlying mechanism. Since individuals
with hearing impairment have a 30-40% rate of accelerated cognitive decline and an increased risk of AD
compared to individuals with normal hearing, and noise damage is one of the leading causes of hearing loss, it
is crucial to understand how/if these conditions share a common pathology.
 The parent project, started in July 2023, is investigating the cellular identities and functional properties of
macrophages after noise damage in young and aged mice. In the parent project, we are testing the hypothesis
that macrophages from different origins are involved in noise-induced hearing loss depending on the age of the
animal and stage of the disease (acute, recovery or recovered). During the course of the study, we made the
observation that cochlea contain several tissue-resident macrophage populations. We discovered that these
cochlea tissue-resident macrophage populations express genes responsible for “synaptic pruning” and genes
such as TREM2 that have been identified as AD susceptibility genes. Interestingly, microglia, the brain immune
cells, also express these genes. Research in the past decade has
the
loss
discovered
shown that microglia are critically involved in
 pathogenesis of AD and responsible for several aspects of AD athology such as early mediators of synapse
 and dysfunction. Whether the new cochlea tissue-resident macrophage ubpopulations that we have
and microglia represent the pathological link between hearing loss and AD is unknown. In
p
s
the current
supplement, we propose to perform single-cell RNAseq analysis of cochlea macrophages and brain microglia
(isolated by cell sorting from 5XFAD mice) at 6-weeks of age prior to the formation of AD pathology (amyloid
plaques) and hearing loss and at four months when there is severe amyloid pathology and hearing loss. Single-
cell RNAseq will provide new information on cochlea macrophage heterogeneity in AD before and after the
development of pathology. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis of cochlea macrophages and brain
microglia will help to test the hypothesis whether cochlea tissue-resident macrophages and microglia are
associated with a common pathological pathway that links hearing loss and AD.
Specific Aim 1. Characterize myeloid cell heterogeneity, and define phenotype and spatial distribution of tissue-
resident macrophage subpopulations in the cochlea of 5XFAD model of AD."

Parental care is an innate social behavior essential for species survival. Hence, a hardwired circuit
has evolved to support its expression. However, naïve animals often show hostile behaviors
toward infants, including infanticide. These are thought to be selected to free up resources for the
perpetrator's own future offspring. Though infanticide was once considered pathological, its
prevalence—e.g., in nearly 100% of wild mice—suggests that it is a part of animals' natural
behavior repertory and could be supported by a dedicated neural circuit. We reason that hostile
behaviors toward the young under pathological conditions could be caused by deficits in both
parental and infanticidal circuits. Thus, a better understanding of both circuits is needed to
ultimately prevent child abuse. Our earlier study pinpointed estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1)-
expressing cells in the medial preoptic area (MPOAEsr1) as an essential population for maternal
care. More recently, we demonstrated Esr1 cells in the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of
stria terminalis (BNSTprEsr1) as a critical population driving infanticide in female mice. MPOAEsr1
and BNSTprEsr1 cells antagonize each other and change excitability in opposite directions during
motherhood to support the emergence of maternal behaviors. Here, building on these findings,
we will continue our efforts to elucidate the neural circuits underlying infant-directed hostile and
caring behaviors using BNSTprEsr1 and MPOAEsr1 cells as two anchoring points. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the role of BNSTprEsr1 cells in infanticide in male mice. This is an important question
given that BNSTpr is sexually dimorphic anatomically and molecularly. We will also examine the
relationship between male BNSTprEsr1 cells activated during infant-directed behaviors and those
activated during adult-directed social behaviors using two-photon calcium imaging. In Aim 2, we
will further dissect the infanticide circuit downstream of BNSTprEsr1 cells using pathway-specific
manipulation tools. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of medial amygdala (MeA), an upstream
region of both MPOA and BNSTpr, in young-directed behaviors. We hypothesize that MeA cells
modulate positive and negative infant-directed behaviors through their projections to the BNSTpr
and MPOA, respectively. Overall, this study promises to provide new information about the neural
underpinning of infant-directed behaviors. Such knowledge is an important step toward new
strategies to prevent child abuse in humans that can profoundly impair child health and
development."

The uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a highly effective prevention intervention, remains low
among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ≥16-24 years) in Africa, a priority population for HIV
prevention interventions. Compared to other populations, African AGYW are at increased risk of HIV infection;
in Kenya, AGYW account for 33% of the total of new HIV infections yet comprise only 10% of the population.
Barriers to PrEP initiation for AGYW are multi-faceted and include institutional (e.g., stigma associated with use)
and intra-personal (e.g., lack of PrEP knowledge or self-efficacy) barriers. Innovative PrEP delivery models that
can help overcome these barriers are needed. The opinion of peers often influences the behaviors and
preferences of AGYW; the majority of AGYW who have initiated PrEP in Africa to date have done so because of
informal peer referral. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a new technology that has the potential to enhance peer PrEP
referral. Much of the emphasis on HIVST to date has been on identifying new individuals living with HIV and
facilitating linkage to treatment interventions, but most individuals who self-test will test negative and may be
interested in facilitated linkage to prevention interventions. We hypothesize that a formalized peer PrEP referral
+ HIVST delivery model (developed during the K99 phase of the R00 parent award) can amplify PrEP initiation
among Kenyan AGYW at HIV risk. In this supplement application, the research aims of the R00 parent award
have remained unchanged. The first aim, which has been completed, pilot tested and refined an intervention
where Kenyan AGYW using PrEP (i.e., peer providers) referred their peers (i.e., peer clients) to PrEP following
a formalized training on peer referral paired with distribution of HIVST kits. The pilot found that this intervention
had high feasibility and acceptability. The second aim, which is ongoing, is measuring the effect of a refined
version of this intervention (based on Aim 1 findings) on PrEP initiation among AGYW in a 2-arm hybrid
effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT). The control arm of this cRCT is informal
word-of-month peer PrEP referral and the trial is measuring both effectiveness (e.g., PrEP adherence) and
implementation (e.g., adoption, fidelity, cost) outcomes. To date (from May 3 to September 15, 2023), 35 peer
providers (44% of the targeted 80) have enrolled in the cRCT. However, unexpected implementation challenges
– including approval delays, participant recruitment challenges, national civil unrest, and supply chain challenges
– have made cRCT recruitment and enrollment much slower than expected. Thus, we are requesting an
administrative supplement to ensure we can reach our final trial endpoints and generate high-quality evidence
that indicates whether the proposed intervention increases PrEP initiation among an important population at HIV
risk (i.e., AGYW). The findings from this trial will inform national and international PrEP implementation guidelines
as well as an NIH R01 proposal for a community-randomized controlled trial, which can help launch the
independent research career of Dr. Ortblad, the Principal Investigator and an early-stage investigator."
10942106,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic infections and lung inflammation leading to bronchiectasis
and, ultimately, respiratory failure. Although recent advances, including the approval of highly effective CFTR
modulator therapy (HEMT), have improved the overall quality of life of people with CF (PwCF), chronic
infection and inflammation are the primary cause of morbidity. Although the magnitude of the inflammatory
response is known to be increased in the CF lung, the mechanisms underlying persistent inflammation are
unknown. We have shown that lung macrophages are critical to the local inflammatory response in CF. Lung
macrophages include functionally distinct subpopulations including CD169+ and CD169- lung macrophages.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that CF CD169- lung macrophages have decreased expression of Nrf2, a
transcription factor known to regulate cellular metabolism, compared to non-CF bronchiectasis and control
subjects, and this did not improve with HEMT. We also found that CF CD169- lung macrophages are
persistently glycolytic and inflammatory, even in the setting of HEMT, while non-CF bronchiectasis and healthy
CD169- lung macrophages can transition to an inflammation resolving phenotype. As immune cell crosstalk
can be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), we investigated the impact of CD169+ lung macrophage EVs
on the inflammatory response of CD169- lung macrophages and found that CF CD169+ lung macrophage EVs
induce persistent inflammation in CD169- lung macrophages. Lastly, we have preliminary data showing altered
expression of miRNAs predicted to inhibit Nrf2 and reduced levels of inflammation resolving lipids in EVs from
CF CD169+ lung macrophages. Thus, we hypothesize that specific miRNAs and lipids within CF CD169+ LM
EVs reduce Nrf2 levels in CD169- LMs, causing persistent glycolysis and failure to transition to an inflammation
resolving phenotype. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that there are functionally important
immunometabolic differences in CF lung macrophages that are specific to CF and persist after HEMT. In this
Aim, we will fully characterize subpopulations of lung macrophages in the CF lung and will quantify differences
in cellular metabolism and inflammation resolution between CD169+ and CD169- lung macrophages in PwCF,
non-CF bronchiectasis subjects, and healthy subjects. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that specific
miRNAs within EVs released by CF CD169+ lung macrophages impact the inflammatory response of CD169-
lung macrophages. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the lipid content of EVs released by CF CD169+
lung macrophages prevents the shift to an inflammation resolution phenotype in r CD169- lung macrophages.
The proposed studies are unique because they involve human subjects before and after HEMT and thus, our
data will be directly relevant to PwCF. In addition, our studies will provide new and essential information on the
mechanisms of persistent lung inflammation in CF and will allow us to identify targets for novel therapies to
reduce harmful CF lung inflammation and improve the lives and longevity of people living with CF."

More than 34 million people experience food insecurity in the US, and 1 in 3 households with low incomes are
food insecure. A growing body of evidence suggests that food insecurity is associated with higher rates of
cardiovascular disease and mortality. Therefore, efforts to improve food insecurity may be critical to improving
cardiovascular health in low-income adults. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity
increased dramatically among low-income adults. In response, the federal government took unprecedented
steps to expand benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). These policy actions
provided emergency allotments that collectively doubled the average SNAP benefit – the largest-ever increase.
However, SNAP emergency allotments were recently de-implemented across 32 US states on March 2023,
with some states electing to do so much earlier (2021), resulting in a significant increase in food insecurity.
Many policy experts believe that this reduced investment in SNAP benefits could not only impede low-income
families’ ability to purchase healthy foods, but may also create competing financial demands that have adverse
spillover effects. For example, low-income families may be forced to choose between spending limited financial
resources on food instead of important health care services and may also find it more challenging to afford
(and adhere to) important medications, which could collectively worsen cardiovascular health. However, these
hypotheses have not been rigorously tested to date. The time-staggered way in which SNAP emergency
allotments were de-implemented across US states provides a rare and unique opportunity to estimate the
causal effects of changes in SNAP benefits, and to elucidate the pathways by which food insecurity impacts
cardiometabolic health. In this proposal, will use a unique combination of national datasets, including survey
data from NHIS, biometric & laboratory data from NHANES, and administrative claims data from Medicaid and
Medicare to accomplish three aims. In Aim 1 we will determine changes in food insecurity among low-income
adults, including those with diet-sensitive cardiometabolic risk factors, during and following the pandemic. In
Aim 2, we will leverage the natural experiment created by some US states ending SNAP emergency allotment
policies much earlier than others to evaluate their impact on health care access and affordability, the
prevalence, treatment, and control of cardiometabolic risk factors, and self-reported health. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether the de-implementation of SNAP emergency allotment policies led to changes in the
incidence of acute cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke), as well as associated
outcomes. This research will advance our understanding of changes in food insecurity among millions of low-
income adults, elucidate pathways by which food insecurity impacts cardiovascular health, and provide critical
evidence on the spillover and health effects of SNAP benefits. Our work could have major public health
implications, and inform policy strategies to improve food security, cardiovascular health, & equity nationwide."

Patients diagnosed with genetic epilepsies suffer with severe seizures, neurobehavioral deficits and the
uncertainty of a lifetime with diminished quality-of-life. Epilepsy in this population remains poorly controlled
despite multiple antiseizure medications and is considered one of the greatest therapeutic challenges in the field.
Despite tremendous effort, there remains a crucial need to study these epilepsy conditions at a preclinical level
so we can identify new and safe drug treatments. Zebrafish mutants designed to represent these human genetic
conditions would provide valuable tools for elucidating basic disease mechanisms and drug discovery. As such,
we recently used CRISPR/Cas9 editing techniques to generate 37 different stable loss-of-function zebrafish
mutants representing a broad spectrum of these epilepsies (Griffin et al. 2021). In this R21 proposal, would
propose computational phenotyping of 12 different zebrafish mutants (arxa, cdkl5, chd2, depdc5, gabrb3,
gabrg2, gnao1, pnpo, pcdh19, scn8a, stxbp1b, and syngap1b) and initiation of a program for large-scale drug
screening. Using a recently developed high-resolution imaging system and machine learning based algorithms,
this proposal offers an unbiased approach to behavioral phenotyping and drug discovery. This first-of-its-kind
strategy could lead to a better understanding of a wide variety of currently intractable genetic epilepsies and new
drug candidates for patients suffering with these conditions."

 Post-mortem and in-vivo neuroimaging studies have shown that beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathology
are associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in typical aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Though previous work suggests that Aβ plays a role in driving tau pathology spread and that this interaction is
key to the development of AD, Aβ accumulates multifocally across the neocortex whereas tau deposits in the
medial temporal lobe and spreads in stereotyped patterns to highly connected cortical projections. Given the
spatiotemporal differences of Aβ and tau accumulation, it is unclear how these two pathological proteins
remotely interact, especially in the earliest stages of disease, to promote regional vulnerability to further protein
accumulation underlying aging and AD. Previous studies have identified distinct intrinsic brain networks and
functional connectivity patterns associated with early AD pathology deposition and spread, suggesting
vulnerability to AD pathology and subsequent spread may be dependent on brain activity. The current project
will use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) to investigate
mechanisms of Aβ and tau interactions via functional networks. The goal of this study is to examine how
network connectivity is associated with AD risk, longitudinal pathology accumulation, and aging. Aim 1 will use
regions of early AD pathology deposition identified in older adult (OA) PET scans as seeds to construct Aβ and
tau-seeded functional networks in young adult (YA) rsfMRI data. Then, functional network connectivity between
early Aβ and tau-seeded networks will be examined in relation to AD risk (APOEε4) in YA. Aim 2 will apply the
networks constructed in Aim1 to OA rsfMRI data and investigate how network connectivity of early Aβ and tau-
seeded networks is related to longitudinal AD pathology accumulation measured by PET imaging. Aim 3 will
explore how properties of Ab and tau-seeded networks change with age and how these age-related changes
are associated AD pathology accumulation and cognitive decline in OA. Overall, this proposal will allow the
applicant to develop skills in: (1) acquisition and advanced analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data, (2)
statistics and data analysis, (3) clinical impairment and pathophysiology of AD, (4) science communication, and
(5) teaching and mentorship. The UC Berkeley Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute is at the forefront of cutting-
edge research and provides access to world-class facilities and experts in neuroimaging, cognitive
neuroscience, and biostatistics, which will support the applicant in the completion of this project and training
plan. The sponsor, Dr. William Jagust, is an expert in using multimodal neuroimaging to investigate aging and
AD and is uniquely suited to oversee the proposed project and training plan. He has successfully mentored
many trainees who are now leaders in the field. The proposed research and training plan will provide the
applicant with critical skills necessary to attain a competitive post-doctoral fellowship and excel as a future
independent researcher in the aging and AD fields."

The increasing use of genetic testing and the development of syndrome-specific risk models has transformed
hereditary cancer risk assessment. We were funded under R01CA132829 awards (4/1/2008–present) to de-
velop the PREMM1,2,6, and PREMM5, risk assessment models, which use family history to identify individuals
with a clinically significant risk of carrying a germline pathogenic variant (PV) associated with Lynch syndrome
(LS). These models are recommended by national guidelines and widely used. We subsequently developed
the PREMMplus model to keep pace with the changing practice of multigene panel testing for several heredi-
tary cancer syndromes. PREMMplus predicts risk of carrying a PV in one of 19 genes implicated in 18 heredi-
tary cancers and was developed and validated from patient data of approximately 30,000 patients. Published in
Journal of Clinical Oncology this year, the model demonstrated greater than 90% sensitivity and negative pre-
dictive values. Despite progress in the development of better methodologies for risk assessment and the fact
that national guidelines recommend familial cancer risk assessment in primary care, these assessments are
rarely performed, leaving many patients with hereditary cancer syndromes unidentified. Patients from marginal-
ized backgrounds are even less likely to receive guideline-directed risk assessment and genetic testing, result-
ing in cancer health inequities. Providers report multiple barriers to conducting risk assessment, including time
in the clinical appointment, knowledge of risk criteria, and limited numbers of genetic counselors. Risk assess-
ment that can provide comprehensive and systemic identification of inherited cancer risk, along with clear clini-
cal decision support for providers is a critical unmet need. Further, this risk assessment must be integrable into
clinical workflows as well as scalable and sustainable in diverse clinical settings. To increase access to com-
prehensive cancer risk assessment, we have developed a patient-facing PREMMplus electronic health applica-
tion (app). We propose to use an implementation science approach to design and evaluate scalable and
sustainable implementation strategies; we will conduct our implementation science study in 5500 patients
from 3 diverse community health settings, each of which serves a unique medically marginalized popula-
tion. We will refine the app and implementation strategies – tailoring them to the unique needs of each site – in
a year-long pre-implementation phase. We will use mixed-methods approaches to evaluate the outcomes of
this study against multiple strong theoretical frameworks. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following
Specific Aims: 1) Evaluate a patient-facing PREMMplus app in diverse community health settings in a large
multi-center implementation study, 2) Evaluate barriers and facilitators to systematic hereditary cancer risk as-
sessment and refine long-term strategies for scalability and sustainability, and 3) Build EHR-compatible appli-
cations and evaluate their ability to further increase sustainability and scalability. This project will produce an
approach to hereditary cancer multigene testing that is scalable and sustainable in many healthcare systems."
10942227,"ABSTRACT
There is currently a dearth of FDA-approved medications developed specifically for women with alcohol use
disorder (AUD). This represents a major public health concern for several reasons. First, robust sex- and
gender-related differences set women at a marked disadvantage for progressing to severe AUD more quickly
than men (telescoping). Second, alcohol consumption levels in women have been steadily moving towards
parity with men. Third, women with AUD remain challenging to recruit into research trials, as many have
caregiving commitments and/or feel stigmatized. Together these factors compound the need to develop new
relapse prevention medications tailored to women, using methods that encourage women into clinical trials.
Hence, a 12-week multicenter clinical trial is proposed, using a validated remote platform, which has been
successful at increasing both recruitment and compliance in substance using women. Overarching aims are to
examine whether 3mg/d of guanfacine extended release (GXR) Vs placebo (PBO) can reduce drinking severity
in AUD women by targeting alcohol craving and emotion regulation during stress. Prior research suggests that
these relapse-related processes may represent risk factors particularly pertinent to women and unique to the
pharmacodynamics of guanfacine. N=70 women with AUD will be recruited at the primary site (Stony Brook) and
N=60 at the secondary site (Rutgers) into a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Momentary reports of drinking severity, stress, craving, mood, arousal, anxiety, and emotion regulation will also
be collected throughout the day and evening via three, 2-week bursts of Ecological Momentary Assessment
(EMA), across the 12-week trial (weeks 1 and 2; weeks 5 and 6; and weeks 9 and 10). All data will be collected
using smartphone technology. Participants will also take part in twice weekly remote visits for the entire 12
weeks to assess safety, vitals, collect urines, monitor alcohol use, and receive weekly Medical Management. It
is anticipated that GXR will decrease the number of positive urines across the 12 weeks and the % number of
days spent drinking (H1a, primary outcomes), as well as the mean number of drinks consumed per occasion
and mean number of binge drinking sessions (H1b, secondary outcomes) compared with PBO. It is also
expected that GXR Vs PBO will attenuate momentary ratings of stress-induced drinking and alcohol craving
(H2a), as well as momentary ratings of stress-induced emotion dysregulation, negative mood, arousal, and
anxiety (H2b) such that women taking GXR will have greater decreases in craving and use trajectories over time
(H2c). The efficacy of using a remote platform will additionally be explored by ascertaining attendance,
compliance and medication adherence rates. Findings will help determine the efficacy and underlying
mechanisms of a potentially well-tolerated medication developed specifically for AUD women. The multi-site
design will better assess feasibility of telehealth platforms while increasing the diversity and generalizability of
patient samples."
10909385," We are developing vaccine antigens for SARS-CoV-2 that focus the antibody response onto neutralizing epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike (S) protein. Booster antigens derived from variants of SARS-CoV-2 would especially benefit from being limited to the RBD, due to the preponderance of conserved but non-neutralizing epitopes in the full-length S protein. However, RBD-only vaccines face the technical limitations of aggregation and poor expression, due to hydrophobic patches on the RBD that form the inter-subunit interfaces in the native S protein. We have overcome these limitations by engineering N- linked glycosylation sites into the RBD. These glycans also help to focus the immune response away from off-target faces of the RBD, and onto the targets for potent neutralizing antibody responses. We will extend this strategy further, to focus the antibody response onto neutralizing epitopes in the RBD that are conserved among variants of SARS-CoV-2. The RBD antigens will be tested as lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccines. In Phase I of this project, we will enhance the intrinsic immunogenicity of RBD antigens delivered as LNP-mRNA vaccines. In Phase II, we will build upon this platform to compare boosters based on variant- derived RBD versus variant-derived full-length S, and to optimize RBD antigens for focusing antibody responses onto neutralizing epitopes that are conserved among variants of SARS-CoV-2. The antigens generated by this project will exploit four levels of immunofocusing to elicit or boost antibody responses that recognize conserved epitopes in the RBD and neutralize antigenically-distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2."

 Because of the high mortality, morbidity, and health care costs associated with critical illness, identifying
biological mechanisms that can be targeted to improve critical illness outcomes is an important public health
priority. Glucocorticoid treatment has been frequently studied in critically ill populations and can improve short-
term survival as well as long-term mental health outcomes. Full realization of the therapeutic potential of
glucocorticoids in critical illness is hampered by gaps in our understanding of its mechanisms of action and by
glucocorticoid resistance, which limits its efficacy. Our future research program will focus on the theme of
glucocorticoid mechanisms relevant to critical illness, with three main objectives. First, our prior work led us to
hypothesize that glucocorticoids improve mental health outcomes by enhancing factual memories from the ICU.
We will test this hypothesis in a population of sepsis survivors from our hospital. Second, we propose a novel
hypothesis about the importance of brainstem glucocorticoid signaling in the maintenance of cardiovascular and
immune homeostasis. We will test the role of glucocorticoid receptors in this specific brainstem area in the
response to acute hypotensive and inflammatory challenges using the tools and skills that we have acquired for
neural circuit interrogation. Finally, we propose to test a novel strategy to improve peripheral and central
glucocorticoid sensitivity in collaboration with a new industry partner.
 Over the past five years I have positioned myself as a multidisciplinary leader across critical care,
endocrinology, and neuroscience. My laboratory’s experience in running a translational research program at this
interface will lead to the identification of specific, targetable mechanisms to improve critical illness outcomes.
Alongside these research goals, I will continue my work as a mentor for the next generation of scientists and
physician-scientists. Because of the translational importance of our work and the inclusivity of our environment,
my lab has become a sought-after environment for scientific trainees. During this funding period I will continue
to grow as a mentor and leader, cultivating a collaborative and diverse group that reflects and prepares the next
generation of scientists."
10933518,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A hallmark goal in human biology is to define the relationship between genes and phenotypes.
Mapping the function of every gene in human cells will enable us to begin to define how gene
expression programs impart specialized and adaptive human cellular functions required for life.
We are especially interested in how transcription factors and epigenetic regulators enact cell
type specific gene expression programs to dictate cell function during early development.
Elucidating how individual genes function to regulate transcription and thus to program cell
phenotypes will transform our understanding of human biology, development and disease.
A mechanistic understanding of gene function requires scalable approaches for perturbing gene
activity, single cell molecular phenotyping assays and robust models of human multicellular
biology. We recently developed CRISPRoff— a programmable epigenetic memory writer
consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion protein that durably and robustly silences gene
expression. Unlike CRISPR mutagenesis approaches, CRISPRoff gene silencing effectively
programs null alleles at the level of target gene mRNA and protein in polyclonal cell populations
without induction of DNA damage or the unpredictability of DNA repair processes. We are
proposing to optimize a generalizable multiomic CRISPRoff platform for molecularly
phenotyping null alleles at single-cell resolution in multicellular models of human development.
We will then use this CRISPRoff platform to create single-cell molecular multiomic maps of
nuclear gene function across space and time. Lastly, we will evaluate genetic compensation and
paralog functional redundancy in multicellular models. Our proposed research will serve to
demonstrate the utility of this multiomics CRISPRoff platform for characterizing null alleles and
motivate extending this approach to functionally map null allele phenotypes for all genes
encoded by the human genome. The results of the proposed research will serve as a
fundamental resource and roadmap for a broad community of biomedical scientists and greatly
inform our understanding of gene function in human biology and disease."

Project 3 – Inside the Black Box of Clinical Decision-Making: Provider Practice Habits, Provider
Caseloads, and Implications for Patients with ADRD
The process of arriving at a clinical decision depends on a complex and hard to observe set of factors beyond
the biomedical decision itself, including the clinical environment, patient conditions and characteristics, belief
formation, team interactions, and information flow. These subtle factors may be especially influential for patients
with ADRD, who present unique challenges to medical providers. Project 3 aims to fill a gap in knowledge about
the economics of clinical decision-making for patients with ADRD. We will leverage unique, high frequency audit
log data on providers’ use of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) system for all UCSF Emergency Department
(ED) patients from 2017-2019. We use these data to analyze the process of diagnosis and treatment decisions
and their effects on the quality of clinical care and patient health outcomes. The project will generate information
needed for the design of technologies and organizations to improve quality of clinical decision making, care and
outcomes for patients with ADRD. First, we will describe the health profiles and needs of patients with ADRD in
the UCSF ED and relate those profiles and needs to the broader nationwide context for ADRD patient care.
Second, we will document the impact of provider characteristics on clinical documentation, practice patterns and
quality of health care for patients with ADRD. We will assess differences within physicians in how they care for
patients with and without ADRD and differences across physicians in how they care for patients with ADRD. We
will relate these differences to key observable characteristics (e.g., type of provider, level of provider, gender,
race, age) as well as unobservable factors that control for these observable characteristics. Third, we will
leverage the quasi-random assignment of patients to physicians in the ED to assess how treatment decisions
and health outcomes for ADRD patients are impacted by the cognitive load of a physician. Finally, we will develop
machine learning methods to identify patient diagnoses based on patient characteristics, clinical orders, and the
results of those orders, with a focus on modeling physician information acquisition. We will apply these methods
to assess how providers arrive at diagnoses for patients with symptoms of ADRD as compared to those without
them. While Project 3 shares the ED setting with other projects, the intent focus on decision-making processes
in the ED, including how pressured environments affect providers and their care of patients with ADRD, closely
complements the study of other influences on healthcare, outcomes, and disparities in the other P01 projects."
10940012,"Abstract
 The ability of certain animals to regenerate their cells and tissues has long been a subject of interest for
biologists due to its relevance to animal development and regenerative medicine. However, we still don't fully
understand why some animals regenerate so well, while others cannot. From a holistic perspective, the loss of
regenerative capacity in vertebrates correlates with the evolution of larger and more complex body plans as well
as the loss of asexual reproduction. However, it's unclear how body size or anatomical complexity affects
regenerative processes, and the role of asexual reproduction in this process is unknown. This knowledge gap
centers on a fundamental principle underlying the differential regenerative properties of animals and their tissues.
 Hox genes are conserved transcriptional regulators key to the evolutionary diversification of body plans.
Although Hox genes have been extensively studied in animals with limited regenerative capabilities, their
functions in animals capable of whole-body regeneration are not well understood. A better understanding of Hox
gene functions in highly regenerative organisms could provide valuable insight into the body plan features that
underlie the retention and modification of regenerative abilities.
 As a trainee, I have discovered that Hox genes regulate asexual reproduction in planaria, a flatworm that
can regenerate its entire body. This invertebrate model's potent regenerative abilities and amenability to
advanced molecular analysis and large-scale gene interference screens make it ideal for studying the
fundamental mechanisms of animal regeneration. Our recent preliminary data reveal a new role of Hox genes in
limiting the body size of planarians. Taking advantage of this finding, we generated animals five times their
normal size and discovered that planarian regenerative abilities cannot functionally scale in an expanded body
plan. Finally, we have identified genes with dual functions in both whole-body regeneration and asexual
reproduction from a large RNAi screen of transcriptional regulators, which lays the foundation for uncovering a
shared gene regulatory network linking these processes.
 Through the mechanistic dissection of how Hox genes support planarian whole-body regeneration, I aim
to expand our understanding of the functions of these key developmental genes while providing important insight
into the fundamental principles distinguishing regenerative versus non-regenerative body plans. This work has
the potential to enhance our understanding of the permissive factors underlying tissue regeneration and to inspire
and inform novel approaches to improving human health."
10941808,"SUMMARY Modeling cell-specific LRP1 signaling in acute myocardial infarction
Improving the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to prevent heart failure (HF) and death remains an
urgent unmet medical need. The AHA estimates that every 42 seconds an American will have an AMI, and
despite the improvement in treatment and prognosis, a significant number of patients develop continue to
develop HF or die. The AHA estimates that 17 years of life are lost due to AMI. With a rising prevalence and high
incidence (>900,000 new cases per year in USA alone), AMI and HF are important public enemies.
Low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) is a membrane receptor known as scavenger for the
serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN)-enzyme complex (SEC), linked to anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective
signaling. We and others have described the protective activities of LRP1 in ischemia-reperfusion injury during
AMI. We showed that non-selective LRP1 agonists, and more recently, that a targeted small peptide selectively
engaging LRP1, SP16, reduced infarct size in experimental animal models.
LRP1's role in ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarct healing is, however, complex as LRP1 is involved not only
in the cell survival pathway but also in the wound healing and repair process regulating fibroblast proliferation.
We hypothesize that after acute myocardial infarction, LRP1 transduces an early beneficial
cardiomyocyte-specific signaling network but a late detrimental fibroblast-specific signaling network
that can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes. We will test this overall hypothesis by combining cell-specific
network modeling with cellular and mouse experiments in two specific aims.
In Aim #1, we expand and experimentally validate a signaling network that predicts how early cardiomyocyte
LRP1 signaling enhances cell survival after ischemia-reperfusion in cells and mice. Network modeling combining
LRP1 mechanisms, survival signaling, and downstream ischemia-reperfusion modules will predict network
mechanisms mediating LRP1-dependent survival. Experiments will leverage pharmacologic and our new
cardiomyocyte-specific LRP1 gene KO mouse model with subject to AMI. In Aim #2, we will expand and
experimentally validate a signaling network that predicts how late fibroblast LRP1 signaling stimulates fibrotic
phenotypes in cells and mice. We will integrate single-cell RNA-sequencing with fibroblast network modeling that
identifies LRP1-dependent pathways in AMI. These will be validated using our new fibroblast-specific LRP1 gene
KO mouse model subject to AMI. Together, computational-experimental studies of cell-specific LRP1 signaling
networks will reveal how early exogenous LRP1 agonists promote cardiomyocyte survival while late endogenous
LRP1 agonists promote fibrosis. These insights will provide distinct therapeutic targeting opportunities for AMI
and HF."
10930410,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Women of color are underrepresented in biomedical research and this Diversity Supplement is submitted to
mentor Mariani Ramirez to earn a PhD as a pharmacologist. Her project is to look for ways to prevent preterm
birth, a major medical problem resulting in disability and death for very preterm infants. Therapeutic approaches
to manage preterm labor are off-label and ineffective. No tocolytic therapy in use today is satisfactory beyond 48
hours, and none are FDA approved. Preterm labor more often impacts African American women than their
Caucasian counterparts. We seek to understand the dysfunctional relaxation of the myometrium that leads to
preterm labor and resulting preterm birth. Our central hypothesis is that nitric oxide is generated locally within
the myometrium by microvascular endothelial cells as a result of mechanical stretch and increased blood flow to
the expanding uterus. Nitric oxide S-nitrosates Cx43 in the muscle cell. Cx43 S-nitrosation promotes C-terminal
phosphorylation that holds Cx43 in its hemichannel state and favors muscle cell quiescence. Hemichannels form
gap junctions at the time of labor. Gap junctions are a feature of activated myometrium. Promoting connexin 43
S-nitrosation offers a unique target for tocolytic development. Translational approaches in human pregnancy
tissues are essential if we are to discover and exploit the unique mechanisms that subserve uterine quiescence
during pregnancy and their dysregulation in preterm labor."

Abstract and Aims of Parent Grant. Given the shifts in social perceptions and legalization efforts relating to
cannabis use, it is imperative to determine the complex interplay between cannabis use and cardiovascular
health. Researchers have identified an association between cannabis use and cardiovascular events, but no
study exists measuring associations between cannabis use frequency and autonomic health in young adults. In
addition to addressing this gap in the literature, the current project will look to assess this association in African
Americans/Blacks at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU). In this burgeoning literature, no study
has examined the prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) in a sample with more than 15% African
Americans, with no published study examining students at an HBCU. The two aims presented in this proposal
focus on the cannabis use frequency/quantity and determine differences in heart rate variability (HRV) between
those with CUD and non-substance use disorder students at Virginia State University, an HBCU in central
Virginia.
Overall Aim 1: To examine the relationship between frequency and quantity of cannabis use and resting heart
rate variability. To accomplish this aim, we will use a self-reported substance use assessment to assess recent
cannabis use and a Heart Rhythm Scanner to record participants' electrocardiographic activity at baseline. We
hypothesize that: 1) frequent cannabis use will be associated with lower heart rate variability and 2) using
larger quantities of cannabis use will be associated with lower heart rate variability.
Overall Aim 2: To determine the difference in 24-hour heart rate variability immediately following cannabis use
among cannabis users. To accomplish this aim, we will analyze ecg measurements averaged from data
collected over a 24 hour period. We hypothesize that participants with CUD will have significantly lower heart
rate variability than their non-using counterparts.

10930684,"Self-destructive behaviors are frequently comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Veterans,
where they are linked to increased distress and impairment. Self-destructive behaviors encompass those with
the potential for immediate injury (e.g., [suicidal and nonsuicidal] self-directed violence) and those with more
distal consequences (e.g., substance use, disordered eating). The proposed research aims to apply advanced
quantitative methods to model interrelations of [PTSD and depressive symptoms] and self-destructive
behaviors at both the group and individual levels. In Aim 1, network models of relations of these constructs will
be developed in a gender-balanced sample of Veterans from all service eras (N = 1,187). Results will identify
which [symptoms bridge (i.e., connect) to suicide-related outcomes and other nonsuicidal self-destructive
behaviors and whether these differ by gender.] Analyses will also test whether baseline bridge symptoms
predict self-destructive behaviors [(specifically suicide-related outcomes)] at 12-month follow-up. Results will
be validated in a separate gender-balanced sample of post-9/11 Veterans (N = 1,494). Aim 2 is to examine
real-time, dynamic changes in network models of PTSD-related constructs and self-destructive behaviors at
the intrapersonal level. A new sample of Veterans (target N = 60, 50% women) who meet criteria for
subthreshold/threshold PTSD and report recent suicidal ideation and at least one other self-destructive
behavior will be recruited to complete an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol reporting on these
constructs. Multilevel autovector regression analysis techniques will be used to model real-time changes in
networks of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and self-destructive behaviors. The candidate is a postdoctoral
fellow in clinical psychology at the Women’s Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD, VA
Boston Healthcare System. Research and training will take place within the environment of VA Boston
Healthcare System and its academic affiliate, Boston University under the supervision of a distinguished
mentorship team with content and methodological expertise relevant to the proposal. The training aims
associated with this proposal include: 1) Gain advanced knowledge of models of traumatic stress and self-
destructive behaviors; 2) acquire skills in advanced quantitative methods for analyzing complex, multivariate
relations; 3) gain expertise in EMA data collection and analyses; and 4) engage in professional development to
prepare the candidate for a successful career as a VA clinical investigator. The research and training
associated with this CDA2 will prepare the principal investigator to achieve her immediate goal of preparing a
successful VA Research Merit Award application to study the impact of trauma-focused treatments on
mechanisms of self-destructive behaviors identified in this proposal. The candidate’s long-term goal is to
become an expert in the dynamic processes of psychological mechanisms maintaining self-destructive

10930685,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs commonly among individuals both with alcohol use disorder
(AUD) and prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) and such comorbidity is highly prevalent in Veterans.
Given the poor outcomes (e.g., relapse, treatment drop out, impaired functioning) and increased mortality of
individuals with these comorbid disorders, a better understanding of their etiology and the basis for the
comorbidity is of great clinical importance. Although common pathways for the development of these
comorbidities have been proposed (e.g., self-medication), the shared genetic pathways of MDD and these
substance use disorders (SUDs) have not been well characterized, an effort that is complicated by phenotypic
heterogeneity. For example, not all individuals present with the same rate of substance use or severity of SUD
symptoms. Consistent with the phenotypic complexity, these SUDs are likely to be genetically heterogeneous,
with multiple genetic pathways leading to AUD or POUD. Thus, by refining the SUD phenotype and reducing
the phenotypic heterogeneity, studying a large number of well-defined cases and controls, we may reduce the
genetic heterogeneity and identify true genetic associations. Moreover, the Million Veteran Program (MVP)
sample makes possible the investigation of causal pathways. The objectives of this CDA-2 proposal are to
characterize the genetic architecture of AUD and POUD, with and without MDD, identify novel relationships
between genetic liability for the disorders and other phenotypes (i.e., pleiotropy), and specify causal pathways
using the MVP sample. The specific aims are to: (1) identify Veterans with AUD, POUD, and co-occurring MDD
and characterize their depressive symptomatology and substance use using ICD-9/10 diagnoses and self-
report measures; (2) assess the genetic architecture and causal relations of AUD and AUD with co-occurring
MDD; and (3) the genetic architecture and causal relations of POUD and POUD with co-occurring MDD.
 Using all available data, Veterans with AUD will be identified in VINCI and categorized based on the
presence co-occurring MDD. Similarly, Veterans treated chronically with prescription opioids who have been
diagnosed with an opioid use disorder will be identified and their MDD history ascertained. Data on key
medical and psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., pain, PTSD) will also be extracted. Control and comparison groups
of Veterans without comorbid AUD or POUD and MDD and with MDD alone will be ascertained. We will also
extract self-reported alcohol consumption data using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-
Consumption and self-reported depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, both
administered regularly in primary care. Three separate genome-wide association studies of individuals with an
SUD (first AUD, secondly POUD) with MDD, an SUD without MDD, and MDD (no SUD) will be conducted on
the GenISIS platform using PLINK. Using summary statistics from these GWAS, polygenic risk scores (PRS)
will be calculated in 3 independent samples (the next release of MVP [N = ~200,000], the PennMedicine
BioBank [N = >63,000], and the Yale-Penn sample [N = >17,300 deeply phenotyped individuals]). We will also
perform downstream analyses (e.g., SNP h2, annotation, genetic correlation), phenome-wide association
analyses of the PRS in independent samples, and Mendelian randomization to assess genetic causal relations.
 By improving our understanding of the genetic architecture and causality of comorbid SUDs and MDD,
these findings will inform prevention and treatment of SUDs and MDD by identifying individuals at greatest risk,
elucidating novel biological pathways for medications discovery, and informing personalized treatment. This
effort will also contribute to the VA’s efforts to treat depression, a leading contributor to suicide risk, further
underscoring its clinical implications. This CDA-2 will also provide the applicant with focused training in
genetics, bioinformatics, advanced statistical methods, and grantsmanship to prepare her for a successful VA
research career focused on improving the quality of life for Veterans with SUDs and comorbid disorders."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The highly collaborative, transdisciplinary Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Research Program is a critical
translational innovation hub for Yale Cancer Center (YCC), bridging drug discovery and experimental
therapeutics to translate preclinical discoveries to patients, while returning clinical advances to the bench for
refinement. To achieve this mission, DT capitalizes on the science of all six YCC Research Programs. DT
assembles a critical mass of laboratory and clinical investigators who command expertise from basic and
translational science to science-driven clinical trial design and implementation. DT members have the proven
ability to translate findings into development, evaluation, and approval of new therapies. The breadth of expertise
in DT allows its members collectively to serve as a translational touchpoint for all YCC Programs. DT’s most
important focus is the transition from identification of a novel therapeutic target or strategy, through development
of a drug candidate, to early-phase clinical trials and correlative science. Our goal is to translate inventive YCC
science in directions informed by YCC’s strategic priorities accompanied by bidirectional community interaction.
We pursue three specific aims: 1) To translate basic discoveries into clinical candidates and strategies, with a

Project 1: HEARTSPOT: Evaluating a Machine Learning System to Aid Decision-Making in the
Emergency Department for Patients with ADRD
The HEARTSPOT project seeks to improve accuracy in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) for
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). An augmented intelligence algorithm will be
deployed across a large health system’s electronic medical record through a randomized evaluation to learn
about ACS, detect risk signals for individual patients, and generate a new decision aid for emergency department
clinicians. The goal is to give clinicians as much synthesized information on patient risk as possible at the point
of deciding on the ACS treatment path. This project may improve ACS decisions for patients overall, for elderly
patients given the complexity of their care decisions, but in particular for ADRD patients, for whom the algorithm
may help fill critical information gaps necessary for clinicians to accurately assess ACS risk. While focused on
improving healthcare decision-making in emergency departments and relating to ACS treatment for patients with
ADRD specifically, Project 1 complements the work of the other four projects that all study different influences
on healthcare for ADRD patients and healthcare disparities in different settings and contexts."
10934806,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL PPG
 Our Program Project Grant (PPG) exploits advances in transcriptional biology to fundamentally increase
our knowledge of the lasting abnormalities in brain that underlie stimulant and opioid addiction. We focus on
specific cell types in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, key brain regions implicated in addiction. The
PPG is composed of four Projects and three Cores all at Mount Sinai. The PIs are leaders in their fields, with
an established history of effective collaboration, and use their complementary expertise to chart a multi-
disciplinary course in the proposed research. Project 1 (Eric Nestler) focuses on transcription factors induced
in brain reward regions by self-administered (SA) stimulants and opioids. Project 2 (Paul Kenny) characterizes
specific neuronal microRNAs, which control gene expression in these regions and drug SA behavior, and
which are regulated by microglia. Project 3 defines subpopulations of microglia in striatum—including a subset
that expresses the D1 dopamine receptor—that modulate neuronal transcription and behavioral responses to
drug exposure including SA. Project 4 (Yasmin Hurd) concentrates on the influence of genomic enhancer
regions, and their transcriptional and chromatin mediators, in governing molecular and behavioral adaptations
to drugs of abuse. All four projects validate findings from animals in human postmortem brain tissue, while
discoveries in humans are fed back to animal models to explicate the underlying mechanisms involved. The
PPG is supported by three Cores, an Administrative Core (Eric Nestler) to oversee and coordinate PPG
operations; an Animal Models Core (Paul Kenny, Richard O’Connor) to provide animal models of addiction and
other advanced tools (e.g., viral gene transfer, inducible mutant mice, opto- and chemogenetics, and fiber
photometry) to manipulate individual genes of interest in specific cell types of the targeted brain regions and
thereby provide causal evidence linking molecular-cellular plasticity to addiction-related phenomena; and a
Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core (Li Shen) to provide state-of-the-art methods and bioinformatics to
characterize genome-wide regulation of gene expression and chromatin modifications in addiction. This
pioneering investigation of transcriptional mechanisms of drug addiction is driving major advances in the field."
10934807,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
 The primary objective of the Administrative Core is to ensure the effective integration and interaction of the
scientists and other personnel working on the Projects and Scientific Cores that comprise this PPG. First, the
Core establishes the scientific priorities and directions of the research through regular meetings of the PPG’s
Executive Committee. Second, the Core is responsible for administering the day-to-day activities of the PPG,
including monitoring all budgets, submission of progress reports, and adherence to regulatory requirements
associated with our research. Third, the Core coordinates the many modes of communication among PPG
investigators, including regular meetings, work-in-progress seminars, and interactions with our Internal
Advisory Committee, that ensure our cohesive research program. Likewise, the Core supports visits to New
York by members of our External Advisory Committee, and key consultants, to meet with PPG faculty and
trainees and review the progress of our research. Fourth, the Core maintains a creative PPG website to foster
communication not only among PPG investigators, but also with the scientific community and general public at
large. Such communication includes resource and data sharing and the dissemination of vast amounts of
genome-wide gene expression and chromatin data as rapidly as possible as well as enabling the free
download of novel PPG software designed to analyze complex datasets. Fifth, the Core fosters several
additional outreach efforts to patient advocacy and community organizations. Sixth, the Core, through the
Executive Committee, works to ensure the successful career paths of numerous students and postdoctoral
trainees. We expect several individual R and K grants and NRSAs to be generated by the PPG's research.
Such career development focuses in particular on the recruitment and retention of women and of scientists
from under-represented groups; we are very proud of our track record in this regard. Seventh, the Core is
responsible, in collaboration with our various training programs, to ensure the safe and ethical conduct of
research with the highest rigor. Joining together effectively to form a unified research team is key to the
success of this large undertaking, and we are confident in our continued ability to accomplish this goal."
10934808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – ANIMAL MODELS CORE
 A main objective of the Animal Models Core is to provide a broad range of behavioral assays of stimulant
and opioid action in mice and rats to support the PPG’s overall goal to establish the molecular and cellular
basis of addiction. Such assays include several routine behavioral tests as well as more sophisticated self-
administration and relapse procedures. It is crucial to employ a broad behavioral battery since it is difficult to
infer something about a complex behavioral syndrome like addiction from a single model or even a limited
number of models. The Core then utilizes these behavioral resources in two main ways. First, the Core
provides microdissections of brain reward regions from rodents that self-administer cocaine or heroin for
molecular-cellular characterization in each Project and the Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core. Second, the
Core works with each of the four Projects to generate causal evidence that directly links specific molecular and
cellular adaptations to particular behavioral abnormalities that define a state of addiction. We accomplish this
goal by providing a range of genetic mutant mice as well as a large number of vectors for viral-mediated gene
transfer, all of which are extensively validated by the Core. The mutant mice and viral vectors, often generated
initially to meet the specific needs of an individual Project, are then provided to other Projects to broaden their
application and thereby promote PPG integration. PPG investigators have led the field in generating mutant
mice and viral vectors, which make it possible to selectively manipulate a given gene of interest within a
particular cell type and brain region of adult animals, thus avoiding confounds with more traditional methods.
Finally, the Core provides advanced neurophysiology, opto- and chemogenetic, and fiber photometry tools to
Project investigators to directly relate altered molecular-cellular function to addiction-related circuit and
behavioral abnormalities. By consolidating these behavioral, mouse mutant, viral vector, and functional
validation studies within a centralized Core, we ensure rigorous control over the data and facilitate
comparisons and contrasts of experimental results across the individual Projects. This consolidation also
makes financial sense, since we concentrate and maximize efficient use of the required expertise."
10939717,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SMALL ANIMAL OCULAR IMAGING CORE
The Small Animal Ocular Imaging Core (SAOIC) provides a wide and growing array of in vivo ocular imaging
services to investigators who employ rodent models of ocular function and disease. The technological services
include widefield Micron IVTM fundus camera video imaging (fluorescence and reflectance, with laser damage
capability); cellular-level resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy
(SLO); Adaptive Optics (AO) versions of both (AO-OCT, AO-SLO); combined OCT/SLO; and polarization-
selective OCT. An especially noteworthy feature of the instrumentation is its ability to repeatedly image the same
retinal locus — and even the same cells — in individual mice over months. The SAOIC Director provides
experimental design consultation and tutorial sessions describing the capabilities of the instrumentation to
potential investigators. Because the equipment is customized and relatively difficult to operate, and the datasets
collected are very large, the SAOIC staff also provide image analysis services when needed. Finally, the staff
also trains the laboratory personnel of Vision Research Core Grant investigators to use key imaging tools
(including the Micron IVTM camera, and the widefield OCT/SLO) when long-term studies are undertaken."
10939718,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LARGE ANIMAL CORE
The Large Animal Core (LAC) provides a wide spectrum of support, including efficient in vivo ocular imaging of
large animal models as well as equipment and technical support for ocular surgical procedures, to vision
scientists who are investigating fundamental processes and therapeutic strategies in large animal models. The
Core comprises an AAALAC-accredited, fully equipped microsurgical suite and three advanced imaging suites.
Ocular imaging instrumentation provided by the Core includes multiple SD-OCTs, multiple electroretinography
units, confocal biomicroscopy, digital slit lamps, tonometers, pachymeters, external digital SLR cameras, fundus
cameras, and a Pentacam imaging system. The LAC will also provide expert technical support to help
investigators understand the Core technologies and their capabilities, develop appropriate study designs,
perform procedures and/or collect data. The LAC will stimulate collaboration among vision scientists by providing
support for innovative multidisciplinary research, and it will support early-career vision scientists as they set up
their laboratories and collect data essential for future NEI grant applications."
10943522,"ABSTRACT
Aicardi Goutières (AGS) is a severe autoinflammatory disease that predominantly affects the brain, leading to
severe cognitive and physical disabilities. Although this disease is genetically heterogeneous, all genotypes
lead to multi-system excessive type 1 interferon (IFN) activity. How the systemic inflammatory response in AGS
leads to predominant central nervous system (CNS) injury is not entirely understood, which limits development
of effective and targeted therapies for this destructive disease. In this study proposal, we aim to uncover the
“driver” cell in either the peripheral or CNS immune system or at brain vascular interfaces that converts genetic
mutations into progressive, IFN-mediated neuronal and oligodendrocyte injury. Using the first rodent models
with AGS patient mutations that confer neuropathology, paired with new viral targeting approaches and
immune chimeric models, we will test which cell(s) promote(s) neuropathology. We will use these approaches
to further interrogate which compartment requires rescue for AGS treatment. This proposal leverages the
unique expertise of three separate laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh (Wang) and Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia (Bennett and Vanderver) to dissect, for the first time, the distinct populations of cells driving
AGS neuropathology and treatment."
10942110,"ABSTRACT:
Background-subtracted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is unrivaled in its ability to monitor neurochemical
dynamics. This approach permits highly localized analysis of multi-neurochemical release and reuptake events
at single cells, in tissue slices, and in intact animal subjects over the course of seconds, hours, weeks, or months.
However, it is used almost exclusively for quantification of dopamine (DA) over short (< 2 minute) time windows,
and exploited almost entirely by users with formal training in voltammetry. This under-utilization is stunning,
because FSCV is attractive in almost any neurochemical monitoring application where cellular-scale spatial
resolution, speed, and accuracy are essential. The transfer of electrons across the electrode/solution interface
is the source of the signal and it is fundamentally dictated by the physical properties of that interface at any given
moment, which change (a lot!) over the course of an experiment. This can confound data interpretation,
particularly when experimental conditions also change in an uncontrolled fashion. This is the biggest factor that
has restricted the broad application of this technique to additional molecules and user groups. To address these
issues, we plan to use standard FSCV instrumentation to continuously monitor the physical properties of the
dynamic carbon/solution interface using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy during fast voltammetric
experiments, and to directly map this information onto shifts in electrochemical performance, in real time. This
will enable reliable prediction of - and thus correction for - shifts in voltammetric performance that develop as
experimental conditions change. The first goal is to enable continuous mapping of impedance information onto
electrochemical performance. This will provide a predictive framework for correcting impedance-related shifts in
electrode performance when the system impedance is known. The second goal is to develop, evaluate, and
optimize an automated feedback mechanism to account for distortions to the voltammetric data that result from
uncompensated shifts in system impedance. This will simplify interpretation of complex FSCV data, improving
quality and enabling multi-transmitter monitoring. Performance will be validated by recording the effects of
cocaine on coordinated glutamate and DA signaling in striatum, which has been implicated in cocaine abuse.
The project is innovative, because it will shift researchers from traditional methods of calibration that use static
characterization factors acquired in irrelevant recording environments, to an entirely new way of thinking about
signal standardization that accounts for ongoing shifts in system impedance during the course of the experiment.
It is significant, because it minimizes distortion of complex FSCV data, enabling measurements of coordinated
neurochemical signaling and providing for improved quantification, especially in instances where a traditional
approach to calibration is precluded. Ultimately, this work will enable countless new neurochemical
investigations."
10941939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ability of bacteria to adhere to each other and both biotic and abiotic surfaces is key to their ability to cause
infection and persist in the environment. Bacteria can adhere using proteinaceous adhesins, including fibrillar
adhesins. Key characteristics of fibrillar adhesins include: (i) they are extracellular, surface-associated proteins,
(ii) they possess an adhesive domain as well as a repetitive stalk domain, and (iii) they are either a monomer or
homotrimer (i.e., identical, coiled-coil) of a high molecular weight protein. Fibrillar adhesins are widely abundant
in bacteria with at least 26% of all UniProt bacterial reference proteomes containing predicted fibrillar adhesin-
like proteins. They provide a range of functionalities to the bacterial surface including adherence to host tissues,
and in many instances, fibrillar adhesins are key to structuring biofilms, which are aggregated bacterial
communities that cause chronic, difficult-to-treat infections. Thus, strategies to block fibrillar adhesin-mediated
bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation are desirable therapeutic targets. However, despite the wide-abundance
and prominent role in infection that fibrillar adhesins play, we have limited understanding of fibrillar adhesins
because their massive size and repetitive sequences have prevented structural and molecular biophysical
studies of full-length, intact proteins. Instead, structures and biomolecular interactions of well-behaving domains
of some fibrillar adhesins have been determined, and in a handful of cases, the domain structures have been
stitched together with a heavy reliance on homology modeling. The lack of structural insight into fibrillar adhesins
is problematic because protein structure is directly related to function. As it currently stands, the field lacks key
understanding of a widely used mechanism of bacterial attachment, and we are missing out on opportunities to
rationally design therapeutics to prevent bacterial attachment to abiotic and biotic surfaces and biofilm formation.
To address this knowledge gap, we will develop novel approaches to elucidate the structure and interactions of
a model fibrillar adhesin, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm matrix protein called CdrA, and then explore the
impact of these features on fibrillar adhesin function. The MIRA award will enable the PI (Reichhardt) to dedicate
greater time and resources to addressing this knowledge gap as well as training and mentoring a diverse group
of scientists at the interface between molecular biophysics and microbiology. Looking to the future, this proposed
research will open the path to the structural and molecular biophysical studies of other fibrillar adhesins as well
as other high molecular weight or repetitive proteins (e.g., eukaryotic extracellular matrix proteins)."

Protein interactions are the fundamental basis of all cellular processes. Proteins interact with each other to form
complexes that carry out a wide range of functions, from signal transduction, and gene regulation, to DNA re-
pair. Disruptions in protein interactions are implicated in a wide range of human diseases. While wet-lab assays
to study protein interactions are indispensable, with advancements in algorithms and machine learning, com-
putational methods for predicting protein interactions have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of
cellular processes, identify new drug targets, and develop more effective therapies. Our research applies domain
knowledge from biological sequence analysis, structural biology, and machine learning to computationally predict
whether given protein complexes will interact or generate novel protein receptors that may recognize target lig-
ands. These computational algorithms and machine learning models can be used to 1) develop new therapeutic
molecules to treat infectious diseases or cancer, and 2) produce new diagnostic tools to detect abnormality in
cells. To provide biological sequences (such as protein sequences) as input to these computational methods, one
must ﬁrst express them as a ﬁxed-size numeric vector, often referred to as an embedding of the input sequence.
However, the mainstream embedding techniques for biological sequences are simple adaptations of embedding
techniques from the ﬁeld of natural language processing. Biological sequences are highly complex and struc-
tured, where the unit of information is less noticeable when compared to natural languages. Two primary goals of
the proposed research in this project are: 1) pinpointing the determinant of an effective embedding of biological
sequences to have generalized principles to design protein language models for a given speciﬁc family of pro-
teins, and 2) applying these embedding techniques to better generate immune receptors such as T cell receptors
(TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs) that interact with a target epitope. Both research goals build on our previous
TCR embedding model that boosts downstream model performance by a wide margin on TCR-epitope binding
prediction and clustering of TCR repertoire. The outcome of this project will be a uniﬁed computational frame-
work for predicting protein interactions and designing novel TCRs and BCRs, which will have a profound impact
on human health."

Calcium is a critical second messenger in neurons, regulating neuronal processes from dendritic integration to
synaptic transmission. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major intracellular calcium store in neurons, and
aberrant ER calcium signaling is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is unclear
how ER calcium signaling regulates neuronal function and neural circuit stability. We aim to directly interrogate
the link between ER calcium handling, single cell processing, and neural circuit function in vivo. To that end,
we will take an imaging approach to simultaneously measure and manipulate physiological neuronal signals
and ER calcium dynamics in the context of motion vision circuits in Drosophila. This versatile experimental
system provides us with unique access to fundamental, understudied biological questions about the
relationship between the ER and neuronal activity. First, the neurons that comprise Drosophila motion vision
circuits exhibit a remarkable array of cytosolic calcium signals, reflecting their computational diversity. Our
experimental system will allow us to investigate how calcium handling by the ER contributes to these diverse
cytosolic calcium signals by comparing cytosolic and ER calcium signals across well-defined neuronal cell
types in vivo. Second, neurons are extremely energetically demanding. We will leverage our in vivo imaging
system to investigate the hypothesis that stimulus-evoked ER calcium signals allow neurons to upregulate ATP
production in order to keep up with fluctuating energetic demands. Finally, tight control of cytosolic calcium
concentration is critical for neuronal functions—including dendritic integration, synaptic plasticity, and
neurotransmitter release—that control neural circuit activity and, ultimately, animal behavior. By conducting our
experiments in neurons that perform specific computations critical for the function of well-defined motion vision
circuits, we will be able to assess the consequences of ER manipulations not only on single cell processing,
but also on large-scale neural circuit function and animal behavior. Altogether, we seek to integrate information
across organizational scales—from molecules to neurons to neural circuits—to provide a mechanistic,
molecular and cellular framework for understanding how ER calcium handling contributes to brain function and
dysfunction."

Minoritized pregnant patients sometimes face impossible choices between earning necessary income and
adherence to prenatal care; these issues were highlighted in our formative qualitative work with Black pregnant
patients. Increased prenatal care adherence and positive maternal and infant health outcomes may be promoted
by addressing work-related pregnancy care barriers. Obstetric clinicians are uniquely positioned to ensure
pregnant patients are educated about federally mandated employment protections during their pregnancy,
however very few clinicians have formal training about employment laws that govern accommodations during
pregnancy and postpartum. To fill this unmet need, a patient- and community-engaged multidisciplinary team
and I developed, and pilot tested PROvider ReMote ObsTetric-Related Employment Education (PROMOTE).
Our research aims will use a clinic-level randomized trial comparing PROMOTE vs usual care. During Research
Aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of PROMOTE to increase the likelihood that obstetric clinical teams counsel
patients about work and pregnancy. In Research Aim 2, we will determine the effectiveness of PROMOTE to
reduce undesired wage or advancement reduction, increase access to accommodations, and improve prenatal
care adherence and pregnancy health outcomes. The rich dataset that we will collect, including electronic
medical record review, patient survey and qualitative interviews will be leveraged as we advance our Diversity,
Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) work. Our DEIA work will enhance diversity in biomedical research
by developing and pilot testing ObsTetric HEAlth Equity ResearCH Mentoring (TEACH) Equity, a year-long
mentored career development and obstetric health disparities research program tailored to medical students
who are underrepresented in medicine. During DEIA Aims, the patient- and community-engaged multidisciplinary
stakeholder and I will develop the TEACH Equity mentorship program including career and research mentorship.
We will leverage existing institutional resources at Duke and integrate TEACH Equity seamlessly into the unique
Duke medical school curriculum which provides a year for mentored research. We will pilot test TEACH with six
Duke medical students to determine feasibility and acceptability of TEACH Equity. The proposed research and
DEIA work is led by an early-stage investigator clinically trained as a Maternal Fetal Medicine subspecialist with
master’s level research training, formal health disparities research training, local and national DEIA leadership,
and experience mentoring trainees underrepresented in medicine. The proposed project integrates research
that will yield an intervention that empowers obstetric clinicians with practical skills to address employment-
related barriers to prenatal care and DEIA work that will enhance diversity in biomedical research developing
and pilot testing an obstetric health disparities mentored research experience tailored for underrepresented
minority medical students."
10942396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."
10941802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project is a multi-site clinical trial of a transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG)
device for diagnostic and prognostic use in critically ill patients with acute disorders of consciousness (DoC).
Acute DoC after severe brain injury affect more than 1 million people worldwide each year. Withdrawal of life-
sustaining therapy based on a perceived poor prognosis is the most common cause of death. However, recent
studies suggest that 15-20% of patients who appear unresponsive in the intensive care unit are covertly
conscious when assessed with advanced neurotechnologies and that the presence of covert consciousness
predicts long-term recovery. Accordingly, recent clinical guidelines published by the American Academy of
Neurology, American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, and the U.S. National Institute on Disability,
Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (2018), as well as the European Academy of Neurology (2020)
and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (2020), endorsed the use of advanced
neurotechnologies to detect covert consciousness in patients with DoC.
Motivated by these recently published clinical guidelines and by emerging evidence that TMS-EEG outperforms
other advanced neurotechnologies with respect to its sensitivity for identifying conscious patients, we propose
an R01 project that will test the diagnostic and prognostic utility of TMS-EEG measures of brain complexity in
the intensive care unit. We hypothesize that TMS-EEG detects high brain complexity compatible with
consciousness in patients whose behavioral examination reveals a minimally conscious state, and that TMS-
EEG predicts long-term recovery of function in patients whose behavioral examination suggests a coma or
vegetative state. We will also perform functional magnetic resonance imaging and EEG assessments to provide
mechanistic insights into the brain network connectivity properties that underly TMS-EEG measurements of brain
complexity. This study leverages an interdisciplinary team of neurologists, neuroscientists, and
electrophysiologists, all with experience and expertise in developing state-of-the-art diagnostic and prognostic
tools for patients with DoC. Translation of TMS-EEG to the intensive care unit has the potential to save lives by
preventing premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy in patients who have the potential for long-term
recovery."
10942698,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Glioblastoma (GBM), the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumor, is an extremely aggressive form of
diffuse glioma originating from astrocytic lineage. Despite recent advancements in multimodal GBM therapy,
which incorporates surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and supportive care, the overall prognosis remains
dismal, and long-term survival is rare. Immunotherapy holds promise in leveraging the immune system to
target and eliminate brain tumor cells. However, the highly immunosuppressive environment within GBM
represents a critical impediment to successful immunotherapy. SLIT2/ROBO signaling is a novel immune
evasion mechanism in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. High SLIT2 expression in GBM patients results in
the accumulation of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as well as vascular
dysmorphia. This is further supported by the prevention of TAM tumor-supportive polarization and angiogenic
gene expression upon systemic SLIT2 inhibition, resulting in improved tumor vessel function and enhanced
efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in GBM mouse models. Therapeutic targeting of SLIT2/ROBO
interaction is currently restricted to biologics, and there are no active clinical trials for GBM evaluating
SLIT2/ROBO inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. In comparison to biologics, small molecules will minimize the
immunogenicity risk, enable better management of adverse events (AEs) based on their amenability for
pharmacokinetic optimization, and hold promise for central nervous system (CNS) penetration. In response to
PAR-23-264, our three-year proposal aims to establish a novel macrophage-based immunotherapy approach
for GBM based on targeting SLIT2/ROBO interaction with small molecules, which may synergize with current
FDA-approved therapies for GBM. Our expertise in assay development, high-throughput screening (HTS),
discovery of small molecule immunomodulators, hit-to-lead optimization, and immunopharmacology uniquely
positions us to achieve this goal. Aim 1 will complete the screening of a CNS-focused chemical library of small
molecules for SLIT2 binding, followed by an evaluation of the ability of the hits to inhibit SLIT2/ROBO
interaction using fluorescence-based assays. Aim 2A will validate the top hit compounds as SLIT2/ROBO
inhibitors using a panel of cell-free and cell-based assays, including an in vitro spheroid invasion assay using
patient-derived cells from GBM tissue. Aim 2B will perform exploratory medicinal chemistry and preliminary
structural optimization of the top validated hits in order to guide future extensive optimization. The proximal
expected outcome of this work is introducing first-in-class small molecule SLIT2/ROBO inhibitors as candidates
for preclinical evaluation, particularly within innovative combination therapies for GBM."

10943832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Successful motor skill learning is marked by decreased performance variability over time. For
motor skills learned during early developmental time periods, such as walking and talking, performance
remains highly stable and precise throughout life, suggesting that associated motor circuits exist in a
stable state that is tuned to performance. Motor skill stabilization has been studied in terms of changes to
neural population coding, neurophysiology, and synaptic plasticity, yet the molecular mechanisms that
transition motor circuits to a state that supports stable motor performance are unknown. Like
developmental motor skills in humans, the song of the Bengalese finch, an established animal model for
the neural mechanisms supporting skill learning, is learned over the first few months of life, becomes less
variable and plastic over time, and remains highly stable throughout a bird’s life. Birdsong is controlled by
a dedicated neural circuit whose connectivity, neuronal composition, and molecular properties are similar
to those of cortical motor circuits in mammals. The objective of this project is to leverage the
experimental accessibility of the birdsong neural circuit and the highly quantifiable nature of birdsong to
define the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transition from variable to stable motor skill
performance. Recent advances in genomics and single-cell molecular assays have enabled
genome-wide, cell-resolved analyses of how the molecular attributes of the birdsong neural circuit
change during song learning and performance. Our preliminary data indicate that birdsong stabilization is
associated with a suite of transcriptional changes in the birdsong neural circuit. In the proposed research,
we will test the hypothesis that song stabilization is associated with closure of neuronal epigenetic state
in song motor regions using single-nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility assays
combined with histone modification profiling (Aim 1). We will then characterize the roles of two candidate
molecular systems, one governed by a transcription factor and the other a neuropeptide pathway, in
regulating the maturation of song circuitry and the stabilization of song (Aims 2 and 3). First, we will
characterize the role of the homeodomain transcription factor SIX2, whose expression is dynamically
regulated during song stabilization, in establishing projection neuron identity in a cortical song motor
region using gene expression manipulations, transcriptomics assays, and sensitive analyses of birdsong
variability (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the role of the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)
neuropeptide system in regulating the developmental balance between song stability and variability (Aim
3). Together, the proposed research will shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate motor
stabilization and reveal candidate factors whose dysfunction underlie developmental motor disorders."

transplants. These contradictory results are likely due to the presence of both Bregs and Beff, and not knowing
which predominates at a given time, in a given clinical setting, or in a given patient. A similar dichotomy is present
in mice, where B cell depletion/deficiency can either inhibit or promote autoimmunity and allograft rejection. We
contend that targeting B cells in autoimmune and transplant patients would have greater efficacy if Beff and
Bregs could be selectively targeted. Unfortunately, until the advent of Tim-1, there was no unifying marker for
Bregs, hampering understanding of their biology. Even less was known about Beff cells. In mice, B cells
expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN play a key role promoting autoimmune responses
in EAE and proteoglycan-induced arthritis. Moreover, in response to various infections, B cells exhibit rapid
innate-like protective responses through expression of TNF, IFN, IL-2, and IL-17. However, it is unknown
whether, or how, any of these responses relate to one another, because no phenotype for Beff was established
and individual cytokines were examined in isolation. Thus, major aspects of Beff biology, including what regulates
their induction and cytokine expression, and relationship to Bregs, if any, were completely unknown. We
discovered that Tim-4 identifies Beff that express IFN and accelerate allograft and tumor rejection. We have
now used RNAseq and quantitative PCR to demonstrate that Tim-4+ Beff express a pro-inflammatory module
that includes IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-22, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-1 - all driven by IL-23 signaling. RORt-driven IL-17
not only reinforces its own expression, but is essential to enforce the proinflammatory module, and prevent
dysregulated expression of IL-10 and potent Breg function. While IL-23 inhibits IL-10 expression by Tim-1+ Bregs,
it does not induce inflammatory cytokines. Thus, Tim-4 is a unifying marker for Beffs and we are now in a prime
position to further identify signaling pathways and transcription factors (TF) that control their induction and
cytokine expression, and at the same time counter-regulate regulatory molecule expression.
 In Aim 1 we will further define the Tim-4+ Beff transcriptome and pathways that regulate the Beff inflammatory
module and counter-regulate Breg activity. In Aim 2, we will identify TFs that regulate the Tim-4+ Beff
inflammatory module. In Aim 3 we will define the in vivo mechanisms of Tim-4+ Beff activity in transplantation by
defining the roles of antigen specificity, plasma cells, and targets of B cell IL-17 in rejection, and the role of IL-
23-blockade in subverting Beff activity to prolong allograft survival. This work will greatly advance our
understanding of Beff biology and provide insight into manipulating Beff/Breg balance to promote tolerance."

Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common and severe structural birth defect arising in 1 out of 3000
live births, accounting for 8% of all congenital anomalies and 1-2% of infant mortality. The high mortality rates
are due to the abnormal lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension that accompanies the herniation of the
diaphragm muscle. The genetic etiology of CDH is highly heterogeneous and our understanding of the anomaly
is incomplete. Although whole exome and whole genome sequencing has identified more than 100 candidate
genes, only ~25 have been validated with reproducibility, and we estimate that many additional CDH genes and
alleles are yet to be discovered. Animal model validation of these discoveries are often lacking, which is due, in
part, to the fact that the diaphragm is a mammalian-specific structure. The generation and characterization of
germline mouse models is costly and time-consuming, and therefore typically incompatible with the need to
screen many candidate genes and variants. The high efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and the
appearance of phenotypes in founder animals has allowed us to develop a platform that can reduce the time for
validation from more than one year, to 2-3 months. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify novel
genes and variants that are associated with human CDH and to validate these discoveries in the mouse. We will
use genome data from our large, well-characterized and longitudinally studied CDH cohort to identify novel genes
and variants in patients with CDH, and prioritize these genes and variants for validation in mouse models. We
will screen prioritized variants using our high-throughput mouse F0 platform and select a subset of hits for
germline modeling and more extensive characterization. Together, these studies will advance our understanding
of the genetics and mechanisms underlying CDH, improve diagnostic tools for patients, and pave the way for
the future development of therapeutics aimed at improving lung maturation and function."

investigators dedicated to studies in respiratory diseases. The Lung Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(CSMC) has been in a growth phase for the last decade with a large influx of highly collaborative investigators
all with well-recognized research programs in respiratory research. Peter Chen, MD, and William Parks, PhD,
are co-Program Directors and will work with a diverse research faculty that bring knowledge from several
scientific disciplines and clinical faculty that provide an interface to collect human samples for translational
research as well as provide a foundation of medical education. All faculty, ranging from early-stage to senior
investigators, are provided mentorship training and education on bias and inclusion. Building upon the strong
history of recruitment of underrepresented populations at CSMC, four positions will be available (two in the first
year) for MD, MD/PhD, and PhD scientists to undergo a rigorous 2-year training program in basic and
translational respiratory research. Trainees will have a primary mentor (often coupled with a co-mentor) to guide
their research training in one of the following six core research areas: 1) Cystic fibrosis; 2) Development and
regeneration; 3) Fibrosis; 4) Lung immunology; 5) Lung injury; and 6) Transplant immunology. To ensure
multidisciplinary training and teach team science concepts, several of the following affiliated research programs
will be integrated into the research project: 1) Aging; 2) Bioengineering; 3) Biomarker discovery; 4)
Computational Biology; 5) Drug Discovery; 6) Imaging; 7) Microbiome; 8) -Omics; 9) Regenerative Medicine; 10)
Translational Research. Required coursework will provide instruction on topics such as research integrity and
bioethics, biostatistics, and grantsmanship and have required workshops that focus on diversity, equity, and
inclusion. Physician-scientist trainees will be provided additional scientific training either through the Clinical
Scholar program, which is a CSMC program that has an established record of successful academic development
or by obtaining a Master’s Degree via the Graduate Program in Biomedical and Translational Sciences at CSMC.
PhD trainees will have instruction in pulmonary medicine to provide deeper medical knowledge particularly as it
pertains to their research. A Mentoring Committee will also be created to oversee the overall training progression
and career development of each trainee during the training period and beyond. The trainee, mentors, and
program will be reviewed quarterly by an internal advisory committee and annually by an external advisory
committee. Upon completion of the training program, the trainee will be required to demonstrate research
productivity (i.e., publications), growth toward independence in developing research questions and implementing
studies, and grantsmanship skills with successful submissions for research funding."

Project Summary
Tissue protection following injury begins with shutting down vasodilation and limiting
subsequent swelling through the application of cold. In many cases, the cold comes in the form
of bags of ice or frozen cold packs, or commercial cooling products such ice packs or ice pack
holding limb wraps. In others it may be via a chilled water circulator device, for example the
Polar Care Kodiak Cold Therapy where ice water is sent from the “holding box” through ¾”
tubing into a cooling pad applied to the skin. The drawback with ice and frozen packs is the risk
of skin burn and soft tissue damage stemming from skin contact with such a low temperature.
With as little as 20-30 minutes of an icepack lying against the skin, damage may occur.
However, studies have shown that 20 minutes of cooling one time is not enough to change the
course of treatment and decrease the swelling. Longer term cooling is needed to make a
difference. However, the patient’s functional mobility and compliance is limited due the bulk of
the apparatus, and this discourages longer term use and increases risks associated with deep
vein thrombosis which combine decrease patient outcome. Ideally, the device could be worn
“hands-free” for extended periods providing a long-term (full day) programmable therapeutic
regimen which includes periods of anti-inflammation (T ~ 10 °C) followed by brief periods of
elevated temperature (T ~ 20 °C) to prevent skin damage.
An alternative electrical-to-thermal cooling device that could be applied directly to the injury
site would increase patient adoption and improve patient therapy benefit. Nanohmics’ direct
electric-to-thermal approach to address this shortcoming will provide programmable
temperature control over the entire contact region in a low-profile, low-power consumption
device that will enable the patient full ambulatory freedom during the therapeutic regimen after
injury (e.g. ankle/wrist sprain) or surgery (e.g. knee arthroscopy). No ice means there are no
issues with melting and replacement, and the temperature can be programmed for cold (anti-
inflammatory) and heat (cellular debris clearing, thrombosis) which may lead to benefits in
decreased pain medicine consumption, post-injury range of motion, and decreased pain score
and risks associated with deep vein thrombosis."

Training the next generation of cancer researchers and leaders is a core mission of Yale Cancer Center (YCC).
YCC has a long track record of providing infrastructure and funding for enhancing trainee research and
advancing the careers of trainees and faculty across all YCC disciplines, including basic, translational, clinical
and population sciences. YCC-supported education efforts have contributed to successful careers of trainees
with diverse backgrounds, from students through senior faculty. The Cancer Research Training and Education
Coordination (CRTEC) Council, which supports and advises CRTEC leadership includes representation from all
six YCC research programs as well as the Associate Directors for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Community
Outreach and Engagement (COE), ensuring broad, cross-disciplinary input and training and supporting the
major goal of CRTEC, to bolster and coordinate training activities across disciplines providing cancer-specific
training while leveraging the vast resources of Yale University and Yale School of Medicine (YSM). The CRTEC
Council reviews classes and other training vehicles in the various training programs and integrates trainees at
all levels into programmatic activities via their association with one of the six YCC Research Programs. Specific
CRTEC activities include building training capacity; monitoring success; coordinating existing YCC education
activities to maximize synergy and avoid redundancy; and providing additional opportunities by sponsoring
seminars, workshops, and travel to scientific meetings; providing mentoring on proposal and career
development; providing training in research of underserved populations; recruitment of women and
underrepresented minorities (URM), and monitoring metrics for success. YCC and YSM have multiple cancer-
specific and cancer-related training grants for high school, college, pre- and postdoctoral trainees and junior
faculty. Currently, YCC 10 cancer-specific institutional training grants supporting trainees working with YCC
Mentors. In addition, there are multiple active individual F and K awards from the NCI. The CRTEC Council
reviews YSM training programs annually and identifies opportunities to integrate cancer-specific training into
YSM activities and provide a cancer focus. An important goal is integration of training and education across
disciplines: basic, preclinical, and clinical science, epidemiology, and outcomes. These elements are very strong
individually and benefit from increased integration that encompasses nursing, medical, and graduate students,
postdoctoral trainees, residents, fellows, and faculty in cancer-related disciplines. Our Aims cover the spectrum
of trainees from school-age through post-baccalaureate and master-level trainees (Aim 1), pre- and post-doctoral

PROGRAM CODE: GGE
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Genomics, Genetics and Epigenetics (GGE) Research Program consists of 61 members, including
laboratory-based scientists, clinicians/clinical trialists, and computational biologists, belonging to 17 different
academic departments, including three members of the National Academy of Sciences and three members of
the National Academy of Medicine. Program members are bound together by shared interests in studying the
cancer genome and epigenome, and in translating this knowledge into the development of new drugs, new
therapeutic strategies, and diagnostic tests. The Program has three major research aims: (1) To identify and
characterize genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional changes that drive cancer initiation, progression, and
immune evasion; (2) To develop new analytical tools, data resources, and laboratory models that enable a deep
and comprehensive understanding of the cancer genome and epigenome; and (3) To translate genomic
observations into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests and develop new therapies that exploit genomic
and epigenetic alterations in cancer. GGE guides recruitment of new YCC members, fosters collaborations,
provides mentorship, and develops technology platforms and data analysis tools to accomplish the overarching
programmatic and YCC goals. In alignment with YCC priorities, the GGE Program serves the YCC catchment
area by prioritizing the study of breast and liver cancer and by focusing on cross-cutting themes including obesity,
metabolism and young adults with cancer. To achieve these goals, GGE organizes monthly research seminars
and interest groups in which members and trainees share their ongoing research to solicit feedback, nucleates
new intra- and inter-programmatic teams, and disseminates information within and across programs. GGE also
holds special retreats/symposia on cancer genetics and epigenetics topics, which provide venues to develop
collaborations and inspire the development of novel technology platforms and analytical tools that benefit all of
YCC. In 2020, GGE introduced an annual programmatic funding mechanism dedicated to the formation of new
intra-programmatic teams to kick-start promising novel GGE initiatives. These new initiatives led to GGE
research-inspired investigator-initiated clinical trials and increased collaborations between the GGE Program
and other YCC Programs. GGE has grown by 13 new members since its last renewal. GGE Program members
are training the next generation of scientists, including 240 graduate students and 232 postdocs and clinical
fellows. During this award period, GGE Program members published 520 cancer-focused papers with 34% in
high-impact journals. Of these, 42% were inter-programmatic collaborations and 16% were intra-programmatic
publications, which demonstrate strong interactions among GGE members as well as between GGE and other
programs. GGE’s total cancer-related funding has increased to $14.0M (direct costs), which represents a $1.3M
increase since the last CCSG site visit in 2018 and includes $10.3M in peer-reviewed funding. $4.3M of the

The Washington University SPORE in Leukemia is a highly dynamic translational cancer research program that
focuses specifically on leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We have assembled an outstanding
group of investigators with complementary expertise in basic and clinical leukemia research. In this SPORE, we
leverage expertise in cancer genomics, immunology, and hematopoiesis to develop innovative translational
research in leukemia. Our long-term goal is to develop novel biomarkers and treatments for leukemias and
myelodysplastic syndromes and to develop and promote innovative translational leukemia research. To achieve
these goals, the following specific aims are proposed.
 Aim 1. We will exploit institutional expertise in cancer genomics, immunology, and hematopoiesis to
develop novel biomarkers and treatments for leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Basic research
at WUSM has led to the development of the following four translational research projects, three of which feature
innovative investigator-initiated therapeutic trials for leukemias or MDS.
 · Project 1. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for T cell malignancies
 · Project 2. Memory-like NK cell therapy for AML relapsed after allogeneic transplant
 · Project 3. Targeted therapy for splicing factor-mutant myeloid malignancies
 · Project 4. Targeting ATR in TP53-mutated MDS/AML
 Aim 2. We will enhance the infrastructure that supports translational leukemia research. This SPORE
will support the following Shared Research Resources: 1) Core A. Biospecimen Processing; 2) Core B.
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; and 3) Core C. Administration.
 Aim 3. We will recruit and train new investigators in translational research. This SPORE will support a
Career Enhancement Program (CEP) to recruit and mentor new investigators in translational leukemia research,
with an emphasis on under-represented in medicine (URiM) investigators. The SPORE has established a
successful URiM post-baccalaureate training program. The SPORE also will support a Developmental Research
Program (DRP) to support innovative translational concepts.
 Aim 4. We will facilitate inter-SPORE collaboration. Two of the SPORE projects include multi-institutional
clinical trials, including participation by peer Leukemia SPORE institutions. We have established a CEP
educational exchange and grant review programs with peer Leukemia SPORE institutions. We will continue to
organize and participate in joint meetings of Leukemia SPOREs at MD Anderson, Harvard, and Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center."
10941896,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ion channels are proteins that allow the permeation of ions across the plasma membrane. These membrane
proteins orchestrate the cellular excitability in neurons and muscle fibers by firing action potentials that are
essential for neuronal communication and muscle contraction. In non-excitable cells, such as immune cells, the
role of ion channels is much less understood. However, solid evidence demonstrated by null mutations of human
or mouse genes have shown that ion channels play critical roles in immune cell function. Here, we aim to study
the physiological role of swelling-activated ion channels that are present in T lymphocytes. To achieve this goal,
i) we will use a systematic approach to discover the swelling activated Ca2+ (SWAC) channel that is active during
the maturation of T lymphocytes and study whether this channel is necessary to provide Ca2+ signals for the
positive selection of T cells in the thymus, and ii) study the mechanisms of transport by volume-regulated anion
channels (VRACs) for large substrate such as cyclic dinucleotides signaling molecules. We will use cross-
disciplinary approaches including functional genomics, systems immunology, electrophysiology, biochemistry
and structural biology, and genetic mouse models to understand the complex molecular networks regulated by
ion channels in immune cells. The long-term goal of my lab is to identify and characterize novel, specific and
functional ion channels in immune cells to gain better understanding of how these proteins regulate the immune
response, and make fundamental and translational advances in immunotherapy."
10942829,"Glaucoma is a heterogeneous ocular disease that affects nearly 70 million individuals worldwide. Despite the
availability of symptomatic treatments and surgeries, ~10% of patients reach permanent blindness, and
treatments do not address the underlying cause of the disease. In most glaucoma subtypes, elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP) is the causal risk factor. Elevated IOP originates from trabecular meshwork (TM)
dysfunction. Neuron-like TM cells maintain the TM extracellular matrix, an anterior eye segment tissue, and TM
cell loss an established pathological hallmark of a glaucomatous TM. Genetics also support TM cell death as
being an early event in glaucoma development. Coding mutations in myocilin are closely associated with the
early-onset autosomal-dominant inherited form of glaucoma and comprise the strongest genetic link to
glaucoma (4-10% of all glaucoma and ~30% of juvenile onset). Expressed robustly in TM cells, mutant myocilin
cannot be secreted and instead mutant myocilin is sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is
cytotoxic. TM cell loss hastens IOP elevation, leading to an accelerated timeline for retinal cell death and optic
nerve damage in the posterior eye, which are the proximal causes of vision loss in glaucoma. Molecular
pathways contributing to TM cytotoxicity are not established, however, hindering the development of disease-
modifying therapies. We will use our newly developed baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) model of
myocilin-associated glaucoma to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of TM
cell loss in glaucoma. S. cerevisiae is a model system that has been used to decipher mechanisms underlying
the pathophysiology of numerous human proteostasis disorders, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and
Huntington’s diseases, and has led to new therapeutic targets. Our S. cerevisiae model faithfully replicates the
gain-of-function mechanism underlying glaucoma pathogenesis: when expressed in the ER of S. cerevisiae,
mutant myocilin is cytotoxic, and, depending on the experimental design, wild-type myocilin can either be
benign or moderately cytotoxic. Further, targeted screening of S. cerevisiae deletion clones associated with
proteostasis has identified gene-specific modulation of cytotoxicity, with new targets beyond those identified
previously from experiments using mammalian cells. We propose three Specific Aims to define the cytotoxicity
mechanisms caused by myocilin misfolding: (1) screen the S. cerevisiae gene deletion library to identify clones
that restore cell viability; (2) probe the mechanisms underlying preliminary hits obtained in preparation of Aim 1
and new hits that emerge as Aim 1 is completed; (3) conduct a high throughput screen to identify small
molecules that rescue cytotoxicity due to mutant myocilin misfolding. The expected outcomes are gene
products and pathways that sensitize cells to myocilin toxicity and small molecule leads for rescuing TM cell
death. In the long term, this work will identify new targets for disease-modifying therapies for glaucoma."
10940416,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Circadian rhythms are the backing track to the symphony of life. Circadian rhythms not only allow organisms to
coordinate their behavior and physiology with daily and seasonal changes but also temporally coordinate
internal processes across organ systems. However, genetic, molecular, circuit, metabolic, and behavioral
studies of chronobiology have been conducted primarily in male animals. Although the overall architecture of
circadian systems is conserved across phylogeny and between sexes, circadian systems are not identical
between sexes. This proposal exploits the Drosophila melanogaster genetic model to identify sex
differences in circadian output signaling from the brain clock to peripheral metabolic tissues. We have
identified two major knowledge gaps: (1) Sex differences in circuitry and signaling from the brain clock to clock
output regions that communicate time of day to peripheral tissues; and (2) Sex differences in peripheral
responses to circadian entrainment at baseline and when exposed to clock desynchronizing stressors. Our
published and preliminary data has identified sex differences in the role of specific clock output neuropeptides
in regulating circadian behavior and shown that age and high-fat diet have separable effects on dampening
circadian rhythms of locomotor behavior and peripheral gene expression. In Project 1, we will use in vivo and
in silico circuit mapping techniques to identify how sex-specific circuitry interacts with circadian clock outputs,
identify sex specific transcriptional programs that alter morphology, cell number, connections, and physiology
of clock output neurons, and use CRISPR knockout screening to identify specific signaling molecules and
cognate receptors that contribute to sexually dimorphic circadian output signaling. In Project 2, we will use a
novel long-term circadian luminescence imaging approach to identify how circadian gene transcription rhythms
break down in peripheral tissues in response to aging, high fat diet, and the confluence of these stressors in
male vs. female flies. We will also focus on insulin signaling as a candidate clock output molecule entraining
peripheral metabolic tissues and characterize sex differences in insulin release, peripheral responses to
insulin, and insulin-dependent entrainment of peripheral gene expression at baseline, across the lifespan, and
under conditions of nutritional stress including high-fat and high-sugar diets. By investigating neuronal
physiology, specific signaling molecules, circuitry, and behavioral genetics, we will develop a complete picture
of how sex- and mating-dependent differences in circadian behavior and peripheral physiology arise. These
findings will provide important insights into behavioral circuit degeneracy – how sexually dimorphic circuitry
provides very similar circadian output under standard conditions. In addition, we will reveal sexually
dimorphism in how circadian physiology responds to aging and dietary stress. Understanding the fundamental
biology of sex differences in circadian biology across lifespan and stressors will identify principles that allow us
to leverage chronobiology to improve human health in more personalized ways."
10930046,"PROJECT SUMMARY
First line radical treatments for localized prostate cancer are associated with significant morbidity and side effects
impacting urinary, bowel, and sexual quality of life. As a result, there is strong interest in focal therapy in which
the cancer tissue is eradicated while sparing normal healthy prostate and adjacent structures (such as urinary
sphincter, rectum, and neurovascular bundles) in order to maintain oncologic outcomes while reducing side
effects. To date, clinically available focal therapies rely on thermal ablation (heating or freezing) to induce
coagulative necrosis and cell death. Presently, the most widely used thermal technique for focal therapy of
prostate cancer is transrectal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). While existing data suggest that thermal
HIFU has less morbidity than radical treatments, its ability to effectively control cancer is still uncertain with series
reporting positive biopsies in up to 30-40% of patients within one year of treatment. Limitations of thermal HIFU
systems, including heat diffusion/sinking and minimal real-time treatment feedback, may explain efficacy
concerns. Our team has developed a HIFU-based method termed boiling histotripsy (BH) that uses sequences
of milliseconds long HIFU pulses with shock fronts to mechanically ablate targeted tissue to subcellular debris
without thermal effects and with real-time ultrasound imaging feedback. We have developed the first prototype
of a pre-clinical system and have demonstrated the feasibility of transrectal BH for non-thermal ablation of
prostate tissue in a canine model. The specific aims of this proposal are built upon the previous work to refine
BH technology into a clinically viable format for focal therapy of PCa. In Aim 1, a novel transrectal multi-element
array transducer will be developed and built facilitating efficient volumetric BH prostate ablation using electronic
steering and mechanical translation of the focus. The BH transducer will be combined with an imaging probe
and both will be controlled by a Verasonics Flexible Ultrasound platform. Comprehensive acoustic
characterization of the BH system will be performed, and BH treatment protocols will be designed accordingly
and evaluated in tissue phantoms and ex vivo prostate tissue. In Aim 2, improved ultrasound-based imaging
algorithms will be developed to enable pre-treatment tumor localization using shear wave elastography and
quantitative tissue liquefaction feedback using plane wave Doppler imaging. In Aim 3, the resulting BH array
system, exposure protocols, and imaging algorithms will be evaluated in a series of acute and chronic in vivo
studies in a canine model to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device. At the conclusion of the project
period, transrectal BH technology will be ready for submission to FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption
in preparation for future clinical trials."
10930125,"Abstract: Immunophotonics is a biotech company developing a synthetic biopolymer, IP-001, to potentiate a
systemic immunotherapy via microwave (MWA) thermal tumor ablation for treatment of Hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). The goal of this SBIR Fast Track is to complete preclinical safety and efficacy testing to
support an investigational new drug (IND) application based on the feedback from a meeting with the FDA.
Significance: HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with 42,030 new
cases in the U.S. in 2019. This rise is partly due to an increase in hepatitis-induced cirrhosis and non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with obesity and diabetes. Currently, hepatic transplant and surgical
resection provide the best opportunity for long term remission, but less than 20% of patients are eligible. Non-
surgical candidates with regional disease only have a 10.8% five-year survival rate. Thermal liver ablative
therapies like MWA are a standard of care alternative to surgeries for BCLC stage 0, A and a subset of stage B
HCC patients. However, ablation targets only local tumors, and systemic tumoricidal effects on micro-metastasis
are rare, leading to recurrence rate of around 70% after two years. Better therapies for HCC are needed.
Product: IP-001 is intended for intratumoral injection immediately after thermal ablation (MWA). It acts by 1)
localizing tumor antigens liberated by ablation and prolonging their availability to the immune system and 2)
activating immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells. This results in a stronger systemic T cell response
that can reduce local recurrence, eliminate metastases, and elicit long-term memory. Investigator-driven trials
in advanced breast cancer show a favorable toxicity profile and early signs of systemic efficacy, with some
complete responders achieving long-term remission. The company has received clinical trial application (CTA)
approval in Switzerland to begin a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma.
Impact: In HCC patients who receive MWA ablation, IP-001 aims to lower recurrence by 50% in stage 0, A & B
patients and prolong progression-free survival by 50% and overall survival in stage B & C patients with regional
disease. IP-001 could revolutionize the field of interventional oncology by transforming it into a means of early
immunotherapy that is broadly applicable to other solid cancers without disruption to the standard of care.
Approach and Specific Aims: In the Phase I, Immunophotonics will generate feasibility data of MWA+ IP-001
in orthotopic rat HCC model H-4-II-E (in collaboration with Dr. Rob Martin at the University of Louisville) to 1)
establish efficacy and generate data demonstrating heightened systemic immune stimulation against cancer,
2) explore potential synergism with systemic immunotherapy, i.e. checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 in mouse HCC
model Hepa1-6. In the Phase II segment, Immunophotonics will further determine 1) maximum tolerated dose
of IP-001 for liver injection, 2) impacts of common comorbidity NASH/cirrhosis on treatment efficacy, and 3)
will develop CMC methods for scaling up and analysis of the drug product."

Motivation: In the US, almost 800’000 people have a stroke every year. Unfortunately, despite intense physio-
therapy stroke survivors retain permanent arm motor deficits, some complete hemiparesis.
Project Goal: Here we aim at testing the efficacy of a system delivering electrical neurostimulation to the cervi-
cal spinal cord (SCS) to improve arm and hand motor control in people with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis
Hypothesis: SCS of the lumbosacral circuits below the lesion immediately restored leg movements and weight
bearing locomotion in humans with spinal cord injury by increasing strength and function. Moreover, SCS com-
bined to physical therapy led to long-term improvements that improved motor control even when the stimulation
was turned off. In stroke the spinal circuits controlling arm and hand movements are intact and located below
the brain lesion. Therefore, we hypothesize that SCS targeting the cervical spinal cord will enable people with
post-stroke hemiparesis to produce functional arm and hand movements, and that these improvements will en-
able the administration of a tailored behavioral training leading to superior long-term motor recovery.
Preliminary data: We implanted a human subject with post-stroke hemiparesis with lateral cervical spinal leads
and showed that SCS substantially improved, strength at every joint of the arm and hand, range of motions,
dexterity, clinical assessment scales (Fugl-Meyer +13) and functional abilities. Moreover, SCS did not induce
pain or discomfort at intensities that were necessary to obtain motor improvements. Finally, our industrial partner
(CorTec GmbH), is finalizing the tests to obtain IDE approval of a fully implantable pulse generator tailored to
SCS of the cervical spinal cord.
Approach: In the UG3 phase of our proposal (years 1 to 3) we will finalize the necessary validation on our
implantable cervical stimulator to obtain IDE approval. In parallel we will perform a pilot 30 days trial with con-
ventional clinical leads used off-label in subjects with stroke to optimize SCS implant procedures and SCS pa-
rameters for maximization of arm functional movements. Finally, in the last 2 years during the UH3 phase we
will execute an early feasibility study testing the efficacy of cervical SCS in combination with 4 weeks of physical
therapy to improve arm motor control in up to 20 subjects with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis.
Perspective: Our clinical trial will be the first to assess the efficacy of neurostimulation therapies targeting the
spinal cord in patients with severe hemiparesis, potentially leading to a paradigm-shift in stroke rehabilitation.

studies and development of new tracing probes, in vivo electrophysiology to allow neuronal recording in awake
behaving animals, in vivo optical imaging with adaptive optics to computer science automated image
recognition routines (Projects 1 to 5). The three Resource Cores provide expertise and service for data
analysis and data sharing, expertise for high precision histology and anatomy, including raw images for the
shared portal of primary data in the data science core, and dissemination of adaptive optics-based two photon
microscopy.
The Administrative Core oversees tracking of all funding of personnel linked to projects and/or cores for these

most cases. Labor, birth, and postpartum are periods of increased sepsis risk, particularly for racial and ethnic
minoritized birthing people. Yet few evidence-based interventions exist. With our extensive community
partnerships and community organized leadership advisory board (CoLAB), EnCoRe
MoMS: Engaging Communities to Reduce Morbidity from Maternal Sepsis will address three highly related
specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop, implement, and evaluate a community-informed maternal sepsis bundle in 4
diverse NYC hospitals; (Aim 2) Develop algorithms to optimize prediction of sepsis around delivery and
postpartum; and (Aim 3) Conduct a co-design process and qualitative study to explore the experiences, needs,
and perceived solutions for maternal care continuity, sepsis prevention, and promotion of equity in postpartum.
In the UG3 phase we will establish robust community engagement and research infrastructures to: Aim 1a:
Design a comprehensive obstetric sepsis bundle that i) applies and optimizes standard evidence-based
components of readiness, recognition, response, reporting, and respectful care ii) incorporates multidisciplinary
obstetric provider implicit bias training, and iii) integrates social determinants of health (SDOH) training and
screening Aim 2a. Create a rich electronic health records (EHR) database from the Perinatal Research
Consortium (PRC). Aim 2b. Collate neighborhood-level datasets characterizing social determinants of health
(SDOH) Aim 3a. (3a.1) Refine our CoLAB and co-design process; (3a.2) Conduct in-depth individual patient
interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with community and hospital stakeholders from one site
to explore the lived experiences and perspectives of SDOH on care access/quality, outcome disparities, and
solutions for care continuity. In the UH3 phase, we will engage community to implement our maternal sepsis
care model, analyze results, and translate findings. Aim 1b. Implement our comprehensive obstetric sepsis
bundle and evaluate its effectiveness using process and outcome measures Aim 1c. Define patterns in EHR of
provider response to suspected sepsis, pre- vs post-bundle implementation; analyze associations between
provider response variation and outcomes Aim 2c. Harmonize patient-level EHR and neighborhood-level SDOH
datasets and use machine learning models to analyze the individual and joint contributions of patient and
neighborhood factors to optimize sepsis risk prediction within the PRC sample Aim 3b. (3b.1) Complete
qualitative patient IDIs and stakeholder FGDs for the three additional hospital sites; (3b.2) Co-design an
integrative supportive care model, with our community partner co-lead, CoLAB, and results from other aims, that
entails maternal sepsis community engagement, care linkages, education, services, and policy efforts. Our
resulting model can be scaled to hospitals and communities with lesser resources and applied to other
preventable causes of severe maternal morbidity."

Project 5 – Effects of Nursing Home Payment on Patient-Centered Outcomes for Older Adults and People
with ADRD
Nursing homes provide care to millions of older adults annually, half of whom have Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD). Yet many homes are unable to deliver high-quality care, putting patients’ health at
risk. One potential policy to address inadequate quality and safety is to raise payment rates for these facilities,
thereby encouraging facilities to employ more resources and treat more patients, for instance through increased
nurse staffing. This project takes advantage of 2010 and 2019 reforms that overhauled Medicare’s skilled nursing
facility (SNF) payment system, changing the payments for thousands of facilities (homes) by 5% or more. The
project will leverage these reforms as natural experiments to study the relationship between payment rates and
nursing home access and quality. Our rigorous empirical strategy, already validated in a study on hospital
payment, uses a simulation approach to predict each nursing home’s change in payment rates from each reform.
The method processes pre-reform patients under post-reform payment rules and then uses instrumental
variables differences-in-differences models to assess the impacts of payment rates on patient-centered
outcomes, tracked in detailed assessment and claims data. Through these data, we can measure direct effects
on Medicare patients as well as indirect effects on long-stay Medicaid and private-pay patients. The project will
show how SNF payment rates affect access to care and patient-centered outcomes in Medicare; measure effects
on key quality of life outcomes such as depression, behavior, and cognitive function; analyze the mechanisms
driving these effects by assessing impacts on resources for care, such as nurse staffing; study patient outcomes
due to shocks such as seasonal influenza to better understand whether payment contributes to SNF
preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19; consider the “spillover” effects of Medicare
payment on long-stay patients who were not the target of the reform; and consider how payment affects
racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic disparities. The project adds to the P01 research plan a fifth major
influence on healthcare – provider payment rates – and in an additional care setting – nursing homes. It considers
the effects of policy in a crucial setting where care is delivered to people living with ADRD and an important
potential cause of disparities in access and outcomes."
10931786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this application, we propose to continue our highly successful multidisciplinary post-doctoral training
program in critical care outcomes research. The training program provides 2-3 years of research
training in critical illness and acute cardiopulmonary dysfunction with a focus on complex critical
illness syndromes such as acute lung injury and sepsis. The academic home of our training program
is the Center for Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute Illness (CRISMA), an
interdisciplinary research center in the University of Pittsburgh Department of Critical Care Medicine.
CRISMA contains over 25 extramurally funded faculty members, 45 research staff members, and core
facilities supporting bench research, prospective data collection, data management, statistical
analysis, project management, and administrative support. Post-doctoral scholars train in one of five
interrelated areas of investigation reflecting the expertise of primary CRISMA faculty: (a) clinical and
translational science; (b) patient-centered outcomes research; (c) systems modelling and
computational biology; (d) critical care ethics and decision making; and (e) critical care organization
and management. In this renewal, we further strengthen our training program by expanding training
opportunities in data science, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, critical illness
throughout the lifespan, and advancement of the learning health care system. Training activities
include intensive mentorship in the form of weekly meetings with primary mentors and monthly
meetings with mentorship teams; didactic education in the form of formal coursework in research
methodology through the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Clinical Research Education, in most
cases culminating in the attainment of a master’s degree; and experiential research during which
trainees design, execute, and complete mentored research projects in a thematic area of study. In
addition, trainees present and receive feedback on their ongoing work during weekly lab meetings and
research seminars. All trainees also receive interactive instruction in the responsible conduct of
research and methods for enhancing rigor and reproducibility via both formal and informal activities.
The training environment is supported by numerous career development resources at the University
of Pittsburgh, including tight integration with our University’s Clinical and Translational Research
Institute. Overall, our training program is designed to create an innovative scientific workforce with the
skills necessary to answer the most pressing research questions about critical illness and severe
acute cardiopulmonary disease."
10931967,"Project Summary:
Fifteen percent of people with diabetes suffer from diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Within a year of DFU diagnosis,
about 17% will need minor amputation and 5% will need a major one. Complications from non-healing infection
and ischemia worsen DFU outcomes. Enabling early recognition of infection and ischemia, and providing
appropriate therapy, would enhance healing, reduce amputations, and save substantial costs. Effective DFU
management requires infection and ischemia status evaluation at multiple time points. Access to wound
evaluation and care centers would improve outcomes, especially in high-risk, minority populations. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for non-invasive tools for detecting DFU onset of wound infection and ischemia. We
organized a new venture, Anxomics whose mission is to bring an improved, home-based diagnostic system for
DFUs to market. The company has exclusive access to a deep learning-based image analysis system to
accurately segregate wound tissue from normal skin and measure physical parameters, including size, color,
and texture. Convolution neural network-based deep-learning models trained on segmented wounds achieved
an accuracy of 79.8% in differentiating infected vs. non-infected DFUs based on images in the independent
validation set. Similarly, the ischemia phenotype-trained deep learning model achieved 94.81% accuracy.
Further testing in an independent pilot study demonstrated accuracies of 88.9% and 94.4% in infection and
ischemia identification using images captured by conventional smartphones in standard clinical settings.
Dispensing with the need for more complicated and expensive image capture technology facilitates the broad
implementation of a remote, home-based, wound management system for DFUs. The platform is being
extensively tested using DFU images acquired from people with different skin tones (collected from Emory
University Hospital in Atlanta, which serves minorities, and another hospital in north India), taken under different
lighting and with different cameras to develop robust prediction models. Our results to date confirm the potential
utility of an image-based artificial intelligence technology to offer unprecedented, rapid, and accurate predictive
diagnosis of DFU infection and ischemia status. During this Phase 1 STTR project, we propose to optimize and
validate our platform for complete analysis of the physical parameters of the wound and infection and ischemia
status by completing the following specific aims: Aim 1a: Optimize the parameters for accurate wound
segmentation and deep learning (DL) based ischemia and infection prediction on a set of prospectively collected
images. (1b) Assess the performance of deep learning-based models in predicting wound infection and ischemia
on an independent dataset. Further, we aim to develop a mobile application (DFUCare) for the management of
physical, macroscopic, and infection/ischemia data relating to wounds (Aim2)."
10933253,"ABSTRACT: OVERALL
Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is rising in epidemic proportions, largely owing to rise in highly curable oncogenic
human papillomavirus (HPV) attributable disease. HPV-associated OPC is often diagnosed in young individuals
presenting with near normal functional status and high quality of life (QOL) at diagnosis. Standard therapy offers
excellent two- and five-year survival probability of 95% and 79%, respectively, yet at a high cost in QOL lost.
Long-term survivors risk a host of debilitating delayed adverse sequelae of therapy. Randomized trials seeking
to mitigate toxicity by reducing the intensity of systemic therapy or decrease radiotherapy dose in HPV-
associated OPC surprisingly resulted in inferior survival (e.g., RTOG-1016, HN005). Other noteworthy efforts to
optimize the therapeutic ratio (e.g., transoral robotic surgery [TORS] and highly conformal radiotherapy) still
yield significant early toxicities published extensively by the investigators, as well as numerous late symptoms
that persist or develop many years into survivorship as independent drivers of unemployment in young survivors
(under age 60) and decisional regret about cancer therapy long after cure (median 7 years survival). The
investigators have further published extensively on three distinct, but inter-related highly morbid delayed
adverse sequelae that threaten QOL and health: 1) mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN), 2) late radiation-
associated dysphagia (late-RAD), and 3) late lower cranial neuropathy (LCNP). To advance precision health of
OPC survivors, we must integrate these individual lines of inquiry to better describe the intersection of actionable
phenotypic presentations, trajectories, and clusters of adverse events and novel therapies to mitigate chronic
disability as adverse events evolve from early to late survivorship. The absence of well curated long-term
survivor cohorts was the stimulus for the development of the MD Anderson Oropharynx (MDA-OPC) cohort,
an active, single institution, prospective longitudinal cancer cohort. Since 2015, 1,750 OPC patients have
enrolled with interdisciplinary characterization of exposures, diagnostic/staging, treatment, disease control, and
validated clinician- and patient-reported survivorship outcomes. Survivors are in longitudinal follow-up by the
Patient-Reported Outcomes/Function (PROF) Core which has to date acquired 31,370 PRO questionnaires and
3,687 toxicity imaging studies. The MDA-OPC cohort is an unparalleled resource for integrated OPC specific
Projects focusing on delayed treatment sequelae in this rapidly growing cancer survivor population. The OPC-
SURVIVOR P01 Program Project aims to maintain and enrich MDA-OPC infrastructure, extending outcomes
data collection beyond 5-years into long-term survivorship to support three integrated Projects focused on: 1)
osteoradionecrosis (OPC-ORN), 2) cranial neuropathy (OPC-NERVE), and 3) late radiation-associated
dysphagia (late-RAD). Our central hypothesis is that clinically feasible PRO and objective measures uncover
phenotypes and trajectories of delayed cancer therapy induced adverse events for earlier detection and
mechanistically targeted mitigation strategies."

1. Overall: Project Summary
The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to advance Yale's clinical research
mission. One year later, YCCI became the home of the Yale CTSA. At YCCIs inception, Yale was a national
leader in T0-T2 translational research, basic/translational science training, and it supported distinctive
fellowship programs such as the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program. Since then, the CTSA has
had a transformative impact linking diverse components of the Yale community in T1-T4 research, providing
the central infrastructure for the effective conduct of ethical, innovative, rigorous, and reproducible research,
and in training the next generation of research leaders. By any metric of scale, breadth, quality, and impact,
both the CTSA's research enterprise and its educational mission have been enormously successful for Yale.
This renewal application does not simply seek to maintain excellence, but to enable YCCI to drive the
continued transformation of the Yale T1-T4 translational research mission and its predoctoral and postdoctoral
training mission and to promote collaboration across CTSA hubs. First, it will support informatics and
computational advances that drive the emergence of a learning health system. In so doing, it will draw on the
Yale New Haven Health System, a six-hospital 2,681-bed consortium that provides more than 2.4 million
outpatient visits from patients from upper Westchester county, throughout Connecticut, and southern Rhode
Island. It will also prepare young scientists to draw on this infrastructure to conduct research that influences the
future of healthcare. Second, it will support technological and scientific advances in areas that will support the
emergence of personalized healthcare, including multi-omics and imaging. YCCI will provide pilot grant support
and training to foster the development of research careers and research teams that can deepen our insights
into pathophysiology and build toward personalized treatments. Third, it will engage a broader and more
diverse group of faculty, trainees, and community representatives to collaborate in the mission of addressing
healthcare disparities that constitute a major burden on patients, their families, and on public health. To
support this mission, YCCI will also foster the development of careers in community-based research from a
diverse group of young investigators and enhance the overall clinical research workforce."
10933452,"Due to cultural stigma attached to breast cancer, cultural stoicism toward pain and symptoms, and language
barriers, Asian American breast cancer survivors tend to suffer unnecessarily from pain that could be easily
managed using existing pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic strategies. Especially, Asian American breast
cancer survivors with depressive symptoms (ABD) are more likely to have inadequate pain management due
to their depression, and pain could further deteriorate depression. Furthermore, the recent opioid crisis has
exacerbated their fear of addiction and reluctance to seek help for pain management. The COVID19 pandemic
has also placed an additional dimension of stress to this specific population. However, survivorship programs
at cancer centers lack the staff and time to adequately address these unique needs of this population. A
technology-based approach using computers and mobile devices promises to meet this necessity with high
flexibility, accessibility, and anonymity. Based on Preliminary Studies (PSs), the research team developed and
pilot-tested an evidence-based Web App-based information and coaching/support program for cancer pain
management (CAPA) that was culturally tailored to Asian American breast cancer survivors using multiple
unique features. However, CAPA rarely considered depressive symptoms accompanying pain in its design or
components, and PSs indicated the necessity of further individualization of the intervention components of
CAPA due to diversities in the needs of ABD. The purpose of the proposed 2-phase study is to further
develop CAPA with additional components for ABD and the individual optimization functionality (CAI) and to
test the efficacy of CAI in improving cancer pain experience of ABD. The specific aims are to: a) develop
and evaluate CAI through an expert review and a usability test (R61 phase); b) determine whether the
intervention group (that uses CAI and usual care) will show significantly greater improvements than the active
control group (that uses CAPA and usual care) in primary outcomes (cancer pain management and cancer
pain experience including depressive symptoms) from baseline to post 1-month and post 3-months; c) identify
theory-based variables (attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and social influences) that mediate the
intervention effects of CAI on the primary outcomes; and d) determine whether the effects of CAI on the
primary outcomes are moderated by selected background, disease, genetic, and situational factors. This study
is guided by the Bandura’s Theory and the stress and coping framework by Lazarus and Folkman. The R61
phase includes: (a) the intervention development process, (b) a usability test among 15 ABD, 15 family
members, and 15 community gatekeepers; and (c) an expert review among 10 experts in oncology. The R33
phase adopts a randomized repeated measures control group design among 300 ABD. Long-term goals are:
(a) to extend and test CAI in various healthcare settings with diverse subgroups of ABD, (b) examine the cost-
effectiveness, sustainability, and scalability of CAI in the settings, and (c) translate CAI into health care for ABD."

The objective of the CCDI is to ensure that data from each of the 16,000 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year contributes to reducing the burden of this disease. The success of the CCDI is predicated upon many factors, including making use of comprehensive, well integrated information systems into which data will be collected, processed and harmonized, and from which they will be distributed. The information systems identified to support the CCDI include those within the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) rubric and the Moonshot’s nascent National Cancer Data Ecosystem. The planning efforts for the CCDI require acknowledging the lessons learned from prior NCI systems holding cancer phenome and genome data, understanding modern architectures of research information systems capable of managing such data, and knowledge of the landscape of such systems currently in use and under development at NCI.

10935477,"PROJECT 4: Activity of Car T Cell Therapy for Patients With Metastatic TNBC - Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a tumor with dismal prognosis even in the era of immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Here we propose to develop chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) to target
TNBC. Specifically, we will target the B7-H3 antigen that is aberrantly expressed in several solid tumors
including TNBC, but has limited expression in normal tissues. In Aim 1, we will conduct a Phase I clinical study
infusing autologous B7-H3.CAR-Ts in patients with TNBC.
Solid tumors including TNBC are characterized by heterogeneity of antigen expression and can escape
immune targeting directed against a single antigen. Furthermore, brain metastases of TNBC remain difficult to
treat due to the presence of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) that poses physical impediment to both drugs and
immune cells.
In Aim 2 we propose to develop preclinical models of TNBC to test dual CAR-Ts targeting B7-H3 and
chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) using a novel dual CAR design and to engineer dual CAR-Ts to
express the CCR2b chemokine receptor, which we found to promote CAR-T cell trafficking through the BBB
when brain metastases produces the CCL2 chemokine.
The inhibitory TME contributes to attenuating CAR-T cell functions. We implemented a model of CAR-Ts in
immunocompetent mice and demonstrated that Th/Tc17 polarized CAR-Ts combined with STING agonists
prompted superior tumor control compared to conventional CAR-Ts. Furthermore, STING agonist 2'3' cGAMP
leads to significant enrichment of T cells with stem cell (TSCM) and central-memory (TCM) characteristics both in
vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, we will assess the mechanism and antitumor activity of Th/Tc17 CAR-Ts activated
by cGAMP in modulating the breast cancer TME and enhancing the expansion of CAR-Ts in the TME."
10935740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the two leading causes of death in the US and worldwide. Despite the
development of second-generation targeted cancer therapies, including covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), these chemotherapy agents frequently cause significant cardiovascular toxicities (CTX). Understanding
the mechanism of CTX susceptibility and developing mitigation strategies are major current challenges in this
field. In Project 2, our team will elucidate the genetic susceptibility of cancer patients to the CTX after treatment
with ibrutinib, a covalent Bruton kinase inhibitor. In Aim 1, we will harness multiomics and new multiplexing
methodology known as “cell village” to perform population level studies in vitro. In collaboration with Project 1
and Core B, we will recruit ibrutinib-treated patients who developed CTX (“ibrutinib-CTX”) and ibrutinib-treated
patients who did not develop CTX (“ibrutinib-nonCTX”) to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The
multiplexing capability of the patient-derived iPSCs will be utilized to form “cell village” pools that can be
differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). The effect of ibrutinib will be monitored on the transcriptome and
epigenome level through single-cell multiomics sequencing technology. In Aim 2, these changes will be
examined using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies to detect variants causal for CTX development,
which will be further screened for mitigating pathways in collaboration with Project 3. In Aim 3, we will validate
the causality of the top 3 detected genetic variants via genome editing in iPSC lines. The edited lines will then
undergo comprehensive functional studies using 3D models of iPSC-derived cardiac organoids (iPSC-COs). In
summary, understanding the mechanism and genetic background of ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicity will
contribute significantly to developing patient-specific strategies that can mitigate adverse effects of these drugs.
Once established, this versatile and high throughput genetic screening strategy can also be expanded to
encompass other covalent TKIs and cancer drugs."
10935741,"ABSTRACT
Modern, molecularly targeted oncology therapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, prolonging cancer
survivorship. As patients’ lives are extended, cardiovascular toxicities caused by treatments have emerged as
a major clinical problem. This problem persists despite the development of advanced therapeutics, including
covalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (KIs) that were expected to have reduced toxicity due to their increased
specificity.
Project 3 of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is focused at developing pharmacological strategies to protect the
heart from drug-induced cardiac toxicities. We will focus on ibrutinib as a paradigm because as a covalent,
irreversible inhibitor of the BTK receptor, it represents an important class of modern oncology drugs, and because
it is a first-line therapeutic for B-cell malignancies.
Our approach builds on our expertise in high throughput, automated assays of cardiac arrhythmia in hiPSC-
derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-aCMs and hiPSC-vCMs), and the use of deep learning
algorithms to recognize and quantify the incidences of arrhythmic waveforms in these cells. hiPSC-CMs treated
with ibrutinib exhibit arrhythmic waveforms consistent with presentations of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in
patients. Our pipeline to discover therapeutic strategies is based on identifying targets that block ibrutinib-
induced arrhythmia using hiPSC-aCMs and vCMs, and then testing candidates in a mouse model. We take two
orthogonal approaches to identify therapeutic targets. Specifically, we will delineate the regulatory elements in
chromatin (Aims 1 and 2) and key transcriptional inputs (Aim 3) that mediate the adverse effect of the drug on
cardiomyocytes. We will experimentally test each DNA element and each TF for the ability to block or exacerbate
ibrutinib-induced arrhythmia, thereby functionally defining genes and factors that are potential therapeutic targets
to revert the adverse effects of ibrutinib on the cardiomyocyte. Candidates suggested from preliminary data and
promising new targets emerging from these proposed studies will be evaluated for protective activity in a mouse
model of ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicity.
Project 3 synergizes with Project 2 since some of the factors and chromatin elements that we will discover are
expected to coincide with eQTLs for drug susceptibility. Hence, our joint efforts will provide human genetic
evidence supporting protective loci with verified functional effects that can be targeted pharmacologically. Project
3 also synergizes with Project 1 by using its expertise in mouse models as well as its data on human
susceptibility loci. Key deliverables of Project 3 include identification of therapeutic targets and possibly
therapeutics to mitigate ibrutinib toxicity, as well as a discovery paradigm to improve the quality of life and
survivorship of cancer patients."
10942344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but come with the significant downside
of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can lead to treatment discontinuation, hospitalization, or even
death. Understanding the mechanisms behind irAEs is imperative, not only to minimize toxicity but also because
irAEs are paradoxically linked to positive anti-tumor responses, while their aggressive management correlates
with increased relapse risk.
Our research posits that gaining a nuanced understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying irAEs could
enable clinicians to differentiate between clinical benefits and harmful side effects, thus optimizing
immunotherapy efficacy. We have previously shown that germline variants are associated with irAEs, and have
also noted that somatic alterations impact immunotherapy efficacy by interacting with the immune environment.
Short-term Objectives:
Aim 1: We plan to conduct the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for irAEs, covering over 13,000
ICI patients, using novel imputation and survival models. This will include aggregating pan-cancer data across
multiple cohorts. We aim to characterize shared and distinct genetic architectures of irAE subtypes and evaluate
how germline variants interact with therapy agents to influence safety and efficacy outcomes. We will aggregate
germline data for 13,000 patients to conduct a GWAS for irAEs and clinically annotate and aggregate pan-cancer
data. Sub-population GWAS will identify subtype/organ-specific germline associations. Longitudinal competing
event models will be used to assess the mechanistic effects of each variant on safety and efficacy outcomes.
Aim 2: We will delve into the cell-type-specific mechanisms, tumor microenvironment interactions, and ancestral
variability of germline irAE variants. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) data will be integrated to
elucidate these mechanisms, and somatic alteration interactions will also be analyzed. RNA-seq and tumor/blood
scRNA-seq will be utilized to identify cell-type-specific mechanisms and interactions of germline variants with
somatic drivers.
Long-term Objectives: Our long-term goal is to personalize immunotherapy by tailoring it to individual genetic
makeup, thus minimizing irAEs and optimizing efficacy. This could dramatically improve cancer treatment
outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens associated with complications, contributing to public health. By
dissecting the genetic landscape and its interaction with immunological and somatic factors, our work aims to
pave the way for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapies."

10942166,"This project will test the capability of a vestibular implant (VI) to improve cognitive dysfunction in patients with
severe vestibular damage. We will measure how higher-level behaviors, including spatial orientation,
navigation, and neuropsychologic function, are affected by long-term stimulation provided by the vestibular
implant, and in parallel will study these behaviors in non-implanted patients with different degrees of vestibular
impairment. Our goal is to determine if the cognitive dysfunction experienced by patients with severe
vestibular damage can be improved with prosthetic stimulation, findings which would expand the clinical utility
of the vestibular implant while concomitantly improving understanding of the role of vestibular information in
cognition. Damage to the vestibular periphery is typically permanent and untreatable (aside from physical
therapy), and when it is bilateral, can result in severe degradation of vestibular-dependent behaviors. The VI
was developed as a vestibular analogue to the widely employed cochlear implant, senses the head’s angular
velocity in three-dimensions, and provides this information to the brain by stimulating semicircular canal
afferents using implanted electrodes. While VI research has progressed from animal models to human
patients with vestibular damage, it has focused almost exclusively on eye movements and to a lesser extent
balance and gait (although recent human studies also queried subjective measures of dizziness and quality of
life). Cognitive processes have been ignored in prior VI studies, even though cognitive symptoms (often
referred to as “brain fog”) can be prominent and disabling in vestibular-deficient patients. More generally,
vestibular contributions to cognition remain controversial and poorly characterized. In this proposal, we will
investigate the effects of VI stimulation on spatial orientation (aim 1), navigation (aim 2), and neuropsychologic
function (aim 3) by characterizing these behaviors in patients with bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) who have
unilateral VIs, with and without chronic vestibular stimulation. To define the effects of vestibular loss on
cognitive behavior, we will also study non-implanted BVL and unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) patients and
normal subjects. Subjective assessments of cognitive function, dizziness and perceived disability will be also
be measured using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and we will also assess more general
quality-of-life metrics. We predict that the VI will improve spatial orientation, navigation, and visuo-spatial
neuropsychologic function in BVL patients and that these measures will correlate with the PROMs that
characterize symptom severity and quality-of-life metrics. In sum, the proposed work will be the first to examine
the capability of chronic VI stimulation to improve the cognitive deficits caused by severe vestibular damage,
and will also examine the association between cognitive deficits and the metrics that quantify subjective
disability. This work will advance scientific knowledge while promoting the development of the VI as a therapy
that has the potential to improve the clinical status and quality-of-life for vestibular-deficient patients."

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical respiratory condition with high mortality. Although the etiology of ALI is diverse,
its pathogenesis is commonly linked to an uncontrolled inflammatory response, driven by an overproduction of
proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Despite the pressing need, no effective therapies exist, and
current literature offers limited new information regarding the molecular components contributing to the
inflammatory processes in ALI. In this context, short non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been posited for their
roles in inflammation. While many studies have delved into the roles of microRNAs in ALI, recent advances in
RNA biology research have unveiled the existence of additional, and often more abundant, classes of functional
sncRNAs such as tRNA halves, the most abundant subgroup of tRNA-derived sncRNAs, and rRNA fragments
(rRFs). There is a growing recognition of the essential roles of these sncRNAs in a wide array of biological
processes and human diseases. Yet, most of these non-miRNA-sncRNAs remain largely uncharacterized as
standard RNA-seq methods cannot capture sncRNAs lacking 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl ends, representing
a significant scientific knowledge gap. For instance, during tRNA half biogenesis, the tRNA cleavage by
angiogenin, a predominant endoribonuclease, leaves a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP) at the 3′-end of 5′-tRNA half,
preventing such sncRNAs from being captured using standard RNA-seq. Our lab has developed the “cP-RNA-
seq” which can specifically sequence tRNA halves and other cP-containing RNAs. In this study, we aim to
leverage our sequencing technique to uncover the dysregulation of these “hidden” sncRNAs, with a particular
focus on tRNA halves and rRFs, in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI models in human cells and mice.
Preliminary studies indicate a significant upregulation of specific tRNA halves and rRFs in human monocyte-
derived macrophages (HMDMs) and murine lung tissues upon LPS exposure. Further, LPS-induced
accumulation of these sncRNAs is observed in extracellular vesicles secreted from HMDMs and obtained from
murine bronchoalveolar lavage. Additional findings suggest tRNA halves and rRFs strongly activate endosomal
Toll-like receptors and induce cytokine production in HMDMs and murine lung slices. We hypothesize that the
increased expression of tRNA halves and rRFs significantly enhances the inflammatory process in ALI by
inducing cytokine production via the endosomal TLR axis and by promoting immune cell infiltration. We will
comprehensively characterize LPS-induced tRNA halves and rRFs in ALI models of human cells and mice (Aim
1), investigate the proinflammatory effects of these sncRNAs by examining their endosomal TLR stimulation
activity (Aim 2), and further establish their role in regulating immune cell migration (Aim 3). Our study will uncover
a novel sncRNA pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of ALI and may have implications for the future
exploration of biomarkers and efficacious therapeutic applications targeting these sncRNAs in ALI."

Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early, less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for 3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.  Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.

To address this unmet clinical need, under our parent grant, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial malformations. The proposed supplement project will perform market research for the direct to consumer (parents of newborns) as well as business to business (primary pediatric clinics) path for SoftSpot, development of financial projections (pro forma), running a pilot with a channel partner, finding the strategic partners, and improving the product (both technically and regulatory wise) to be ready for launch and scaling.  

The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to lowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety."
10946862,"Abstract (Parent Grant)
Biology is driven through the action of proteins. We know that structure often provides the foundation for proteins’
function, but in recent years it has become clear that protein function is also critically dependent on dynamics,
or movements of structure. How dynamics enables function is now a central question in protein biology that limits
our basic understanding of proteins, as well as applications in drug discovery and protein design. While there
are many types of functions that dynamics – or conformational flexibility – promotes, two functional archetypes
for dynamics are enzyme catalysis and allostery. The mechanistic bases for these two phenomena, pervasive
as they are, remain largely mysterious and have attracted much attention for the likely role of dynamics. The Lee
laboratory has focused on studying dynamics and allostery in proteins using NMR and other biophysical methods
for nearly 20 years. The approach outlined in this proposal is to combine investigation of natural allosteric
enzymes (Areas 1 and 2) with efforts to engineer allosteric regulation into signaling proteins using optogenetics
(Area 3). In the last five years, the lab has developed two complementary systems for NMR and biophysical
studies of dynamics and allostery that are highly amenable for addressing these mechanistic questions and,
importantly, developing approaches to study intersubunit allosteric communication. The two systems are the
enzymes chorismate mutase (CM) and thymidylate synthase (TS), both symmetric homodimers that are
functionally allosteric. CM (from yeast) is a classically allosteric protein, exhibiting all the hallmarks of traditional
allostery: sigmoidal activity curve; symmetric quaternary structure; tense (“T”) and relaxed (“R”) conformations;
and small molecule allosteric effector ligands that either up- or down-regulate activity. In contrast to CM’s positive
cooperativity, TS is negatively cooperative because it is half-the-sites reactive. Work will be on the E. coli (ecTS)
and human (hTS) forms, which, despite their similarities show very different behaviors. The human TS is the
target of anticancer drug 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU). CM, ecTS, and hTS all have outstanding features for study by
solution NMR since they are highly soluble, stable, and yield excellent spectra. The goals for the next five years
fall into three main areas: (1) Through the use of NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations,
calorimetry, x-ray crystallography, and biochemistry, the structural and dynamic properties of these enzymes will
be related to functional behaviors of key interest, such as: allosteric communication; how apo state conformations
compare to T and R conformations; protomer asymmetry in singly liganded states; and the nature of the transition
state. (2) We will advance the study of protein homodimers by NMR by introducing a technology for chemical
conjugation of protomers using click chemistry. Mixed labeled dimers produced this way will facilitate NMR study
of interprotomer interactions, such as allostery, and improve NMR structure determination of homodimers. (3)
For engineered GTPases that have been artificially placed under optogenetic control, the allosteric mechanisms
will be determined using an NMR approach."

Knowledge of tissue oxygen levels has enormous clinical significance for accurate prognosis and treatment of
several pathologies including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, wound healing, and cancer. Currently, there is an
unmet need for devices that can measure oxygen reliably in the clinical settings. Although several methods are
promising for clinical oximetry, they lack the ability to make reliable and repeated measurements of absolute
values of oxygen, for example pO2, during or post-therapy. Oximetry based on electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) offers certain unique advantages including accuracy, direct detection and high sensitivity and specificity
to molecular oxygen (O2). Unfortunately, the adaptation of EPR oximetry for clinical measurements is faced with
certain limitations, most notably due to restrictions that arise from the existing hardware. The conventional EPR
systems are large, bulky units with restrictive spacing between the magnet poles (for patient placement) and
require the patient to be transported to the EPR facility for measurements. Major changes in the hardware and
more importantly out-side-the-box approaches in the overall design are needed to make the EPR technology a
viable tool for use by bedside or at treatment site for successful clinical adaptation and implementation. The
overall goal of this project is to develop an innovative device for on-site monitoring of pO2 in patients. We propose
to construct a unique self-contained ultra-small, needle-shaped EPR probe-head, namely OxyTrack that can be
used on-site, in the clinic or procedure room. In contrast to the existing EPR systems that contain a formidably
large magnet thereby necessitating the patients transported to the EPR magnet, our innovative approach will
use an extremely miniaturized magnet that is tightly integrated with resonator and oxygen-sensing probe, making
a single unit (sensor). The integrated unit will be built inside the tip of a 21G syringe needle for minimally invasive
insertion into tissues of interest. The EPR spectrometer, an external device connected to the OxyTrack needle,
will be built based on state-of-the-art software-defined-radio (SDR) technology. We will assess the efficacy,
reliability, and safety of the OxyTrack using tissue models and animals and validate the system performance
using existing methods for oximetry. The specific aims of this project include: (i) Design and construction of an
OxyTrack needle with built-in magnet, resonator, and oxygen sensor; (ii) Development of a compact
spectrometer to work with the OxyTrack sensor; and (iii) Testing and validation of the OxyTrack system
performance in vitro and in vivo. The OxyTrack oxygen sensor, when established as intended, will be a very
valuable clinical tool for clinical conditions where tissue oxygen is a critical variable for decision making, e.g.,
cancer patients and patients with diabetic peripheral vascular diseases."

The hallmark features of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are exercise intolerance and
exertional symptomology. It is now clear that the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance involves multiple
physiological systems in HFpEF with peripheral (‘non-cardiac’) abnormalities having a critical role. Locomotor
muscle afferent feedback reflexes are necessary for the normal locomotor muscle blood flow and ventilatory
responses to exercise in healthy adults. However, these locomotor muscle afferent reflexes appear to be
‘overactive’ with HFpEF impairing locomotor blood flow and exaggerating the ventilatory response. Additionally,
pulmonary system alterations and inspiratory muscle metabolic inefficiency in HFpEF necessitate an
exaggerated inspiratory muscle blood flow demand during exercise. Importantly, HFpEF patients are unable to
meet this exaggerated inspiratory muscle blood flow demand during exercise. This exaggerated deficit between
inspiratory muscle blood flow demand and blood flow response to exercise in HFpEF may predispose them to
exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnea. Our scientific premise is that locomotor and inspiratory muscle
pathophysiologic mechanisms contribute to the well described exercise intolerance and exertional symptoms in
HFpEF patients. The Specific Aims that will be explored in this proposal include: 1) To test if locomotor skeletal
muscle afferent feedback reflexes contribute to the abnormal cardiovascular and ventilatory function during
exercise in HFpEF, and 2) To test if inspiratory muscle training reduces the exaggerated inspiratory muscle blood
flow demand in HFpEF and improves exercise tolerance and exertional symptomology in these patients. Both
Aims are framed with testable hypotheses and clearly associated with the experimental protocol and statistical
analysis plan. Our integrative, highly collaborative research team has the intellectual and technical expertise,
established infrastructure, and clearly demonstrate high feasibility in performing all facets of these studies to
address and interpret the Aims we have proposed. Our proposal addresses an important problem by focusing
on ideas that are a significant departure from current paradigms on exercise intolerance and exertional
symptomology in HFpEF patients. Our preliminary data and review of the rigor of prior research supporting
our Aims provide strong justification for our innovative experimental design, gold standard techniques, and
inspiratory muscle training (an intervention with high clinical utility) to reveal how locomotor and inspiratory
muscle dysfunction impair exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea in patients with HFpEF. Finally, we have
aligned our scientific premise, aims, and associated hypotheses with the NHLBI Research Priorities and the
current NIH review criteria that emphasizes significance, impact, and innovation for R01 applications."

This project provides the applicant with Ph.D. training in cell and developmental biology. Thesis research will
further our understanding how cell signaling mediates cell-cell interactions to facilitate intricate skeletal patterning.
Additionally, the applicant will pursue activities supporting professional development, advanced imaging,
mentorship, and science communication skills. Zebrafish rapidly and robustly regenerate their caudal fins,
including their characteristic bony ray skeleton. During fin development and regeneration, most rays branch to
form distinct daughter rays. Ray branching occurs through the splitting of progenitor osteoblast (pOb) pools
adjacent to sonic hedgehog a (shha)-expressing basal epidermal cells (bEps). The shha-expressing bEp
domains themselves split prior to overt branching. Small molecule inhibition of Sonic hedgehog/Smoothened
(Shh/Smo) signaling specifically prevents ray branching. The unbranched rays grow to their normal length and
the shha-expressing bEp domains still split. However, the Shh/Smo target genes and how they influence cell
behaviors that divide pOb pools are unknown. This proposal aims to identify relevant Shh/Smo target genes and
how they promote interactions between shha-expressing bEps and pObs for ray branching morphogenesis.
Previous studies and the applicant’s preliminary data using a new long-term live imaging approach indicate that
collectively migrating shha-expressing bEps contact individual pObs and progressively escort them into split
pools during ray outgrowth. Further, the applicant has identified a Shh-dependent gene, fibrillin 2b (fbn2b), that
when germline mutated causes unbranched rays in regenerated fins. Together, these results support the
applicant’s hypothesis that Shh/Smo promotes transient Fbn2b-dependent heterotypic cell associations
underlying co-movements of shha-expressing bEps and pObs. The applicant will explore this hypothesis with
two aims. Aim 1 will identify Shh/Smo target genes that mediate ray branching during fin regeneration. Aim 2 will
define Shh/Smo driven associations of migrating Shh+ basal epidermal cells and underlying progenitor
osteoblasts throughout the duration of branching morphogenesis. Completing these aims will reveal Shh/Smo-
dependent, coordinated cell behaviors and new mediators of skeletal ray branching morphogenesis. These
insights will advance our mechanistic understanding of skeletal outgrowth and patterning with potential
biomedical significance for skeletal regenerative medicine."

The opioid epidemic is a persistent public health crisis in the United States and abroad, historically dominated
by the misuse of prescription opioids and heroin; however, those illicit substances have been overtaken by a
surge in the synthetic opioid fentanyl. Fentanyl’s unmatched potency and addictiveness makes it more difficult
to treat with pharmaceuticals that act on opiate receptors directly; as a result, opioid overdose deaths in the
U.S. skyrocketed to more than 80,000 in 2021. Novel therapeutic approaches to manage this crisis are
urgently needed, making understanding basic opiate signaling mechanisms in the brain critically important.
 A potential target to mitigate opioid use disorder (OUD) are the cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), which are
co-expressed alongside opiate receptors in the brain’s reward centers. Recent studies indicate that CBRs can
modulate opioid-reward behaviors; however, our understanding is challenged by multiple CBR subtypes that
have dynamic and overlapping expression in the brain. Antibodies for CBRs can be nonspecific and provide
only a snapshot of receptor localization, and conventional approaches to manipulate CBRs have poor spatial
and temporal resolution: Genetic knock-outs are prone to compensation, while microinjection or wash-on of
hydrophobic cannabinoid ligands suffer from poor kinetics and don’t distinguish between CBRs on overlapping
circuits. To delineate the role(s) of CBRs in opioid reward and as a potential therapeutic target for OUD, there
is a critical need for new tools to probe their localization and manipulate their signaling with high resolution.
The long-term goal of my lab is to build chemical tools for deconvoluting the molecular components of
substance use disorder, and I have pioneered several chemical biology technologies to study CBRs with
enhanced spatiotemporal precision. In collaboration with Erick Carreira’s lab, we developed fluorescent probes
that label CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors with a fluorophore. These overcome the poor selectivity of
antibodies and can be applied to live-cell imaging experiments. We also developed chemical photoswitches
allowing acute reversible optical manipulation of CB1 and CB2, which permits control of downstream signaling
by a precise optical stimulus. The objective of this proposal is to expand our cannabinoid chemical biology
toolkit towards the atypical cannabinoid receptor GPR55, and then apply these tools in ex vivo and in vivo
models of opioid administration. We will explore the interactions between cannabinoid and opiate receptors in
the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical hub in the brain’s reward system. This proposal has a strong
scientific premise built on our published studies, preliminary data, and a careful review of the literature. It is
innovative because it applies our state-of-the-art tools to illuminate basic signaling mechanisms relevant to
opioid reward and could generate novel therapeutic avenues for OUD. This study holds significant implications
not just for understanding the basic neurobiology of addiction, but also for the development of next-generation
therapies for one of the most pressing public health crises of our time—the opioid epidemic."
10903161,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cell identity, crucially controlled by transcription factors (TFs), is perturbed in cancer, contributing to highly
aggressive and metastatic tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC represents a
formidable challenge with an alarmingly low 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Predominantly driven by
mutations in KRAS and subsequent loss of tumor suppressor genes, PDAC is poised to become the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses
have identified two distinct PDAC subtypes: classical and basal. The critical difference between these subtypes
lies in the expression of endodermal lineage specifiers, with the classical subtype expressing FOXA1, FOXA2
(FOXA1/2), and HNF4⍺, critical for pancreatic cell-fate determination, while the basal subtype downregulates
these genes, leading to the loss of endodermal identity. The clinical significance of these subtypes is evident as
the basal subtype confers shorter median survival and exhibits differential responses to first-line chemotherapies.
We reason that endodermal lineage-specific TFs not only serve as a biomarker for the classical subtype but are
essential regulators of PDAC subtype differentiation. Understanding the molecular regulators of the classical
subtype is crucial as they may hold the key to developing effective targeted therapies and improving patient
outcomes. Furthermore, the emergence of targeted therapies has highlighted the role of changes in cancer cell
identity as a resistance mechanism. Here we focus on the pivotal transcription factors, FOXA1/2 and HNF4α,
that play critical roles in pancreatic development. Despite their relevance in other cancers, their specific functions
in PDAC remain largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to define the functional roles of FOXA1/2 and HNF4⍺
in the classical PDAC subtype, exploring their regulation of growth and cellular identity. Additionally, we will
investigate how MEK/ERK signaling influences FOXA1/2 and HNF4⍺'s transcriptional activity in PDAC, shedding
light on the mechanisms underlying lineage switching upon MEK/ERK inhibition. Overall, we will test the
central hypothesis that FOXA1/2 and HNF4⍺ are critical regulators of the transcriptional network
governing the cellular identity of classical PDAC and that MEK/ERK signaling modulates the activity of
these TFs. To test this hypothesis, we will be reconstituting and modulating the expression of these factors in
human and murine PDAC cell and organoid lines and assessing gene expression changes and genomic
localization of these TFs through ChIP-seq. This proposal will show how oncogenic signaling and lineage-
defining TFs regulate cancer cell identity."
10943676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Uncontrolled hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a major source of maternal mortality. National
guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) measurement 3–10 days after discharge and ≥1 preventive care
visit within one year of delivery. Yet, barriers such as childcare or transportation issues reduce adherence to in-
person BP checks, particularly among racial or ethnic minority patients. Programs in which patients self-
measure BP (SMBP) at home show promising results regardless of patient race. However, a recent meta-
analysis concluded current SMBP programs do not reduce maternal mortality or racial disparities in clinical
outcomes, potentially due to their specific limitations: they end within six weeks of birth (though HDP can
persist for months) and have decreased engagement with non-White people or those living in disadvantaged
areas, though these populations are at the highest risk of persistent HTN and its adverse long-term effects.
Thus, there is an urgent need to optimize SMBP programs to target short- and long-term HDP-related
morbidity and to broadly implement these programs to eliminate disparities in HDP-related outcomes. One
such program is Rhode Island (RI)-Statewide Postpartum HypErtension REmote Surveillance (RI-SPHERES),
a technology-based SMBP program that aims to reduce short- and long-term HDP-associated morbidity in RI
using the collaborative care model, a health services intervention that improves health outcomes and reduces
racial disparities on a population level for people with chronic conditions. The proposed research aims to
determine the effectiveness of RI-SPHERES in reducing short- and long-term morbidity associated with HDP
throughout RI. This builds upon our pilot RCT (NCT05595629), in which a standard SMBP program was
compared to a SMBP program that used a Bluetooth-enabled BP cuff that syncs to a smartphone application
(app) to send automated reminders and provide adaptive messaging tailored to distinct BP values and
symptoms. RI-SPHERES will expand this SMBP program to provide app-based patient-informed educational
content on HDP-specific preventive care and bidirectional communication with RI-SPHERES staff for one year
postpartum. Incorporating adaptive and automatic messaging increases RI-SPHERES’ scalability by reducing
clinical staff burden. However, formal analysis of factors that may hinder widespread implementation of RI-
SPHERES is needed. Thus, we will conduct a Hybrid Type I Non-Inferiority Implementation-Effectiveness
Trial among 1,536 patients with HDP that compares a standard SMBP program to RI-SPHERES in terms of
persistent HTN at six weeks postpartum and receipt of preventive care within one year of delivery. We will also
develop an implementation toolkit to facilitate the dissemination of RI-SPHERES. The proposed project is
expected to deliver a mechanism that will fill multiple research gaps for HDP identified by the US
Preventive Services Task Force: 1) addressing health inequities through multilevel interventions, 2)
evaluating SMBP programs; and 3) mitigating HDP’s short- and long-term health consequences of HDP."
10943723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sudden cardiac death is primarily caused by ventricular arrhythmias, accounting for nearly half of all
cardiovascular disease deaths in the US. However, most of the currently available antiarrhythmic drugs are
proarrhythmic, and while implanted cardioverter defibrillators are believed to be the most effective therapy, their
low efficacy and high cost pose significant challenges. Both implanted cardioverter defibrillators and drug
therapies necessitate accurate risk stratification, and drug therapies require not only a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanisms but also the identification of appropriate drug targets. The difficulties in risk
stratification and identifying the right drug targets are that: 1) at the individual scale, arrhythmias have multiple
and multiscale causes and mechanisms. Drugs target entities at the molecular scale but arrhythmias are
fundamentally tissue-scale phenomena, with no simple one-to-one relationships due to complex multiscale
nonlinear interactions. An antiarrhythmic drug may suppress one particular arrhythmia mechanism but potentiate
another mechanism, unexpectedly increasing rather than decreasing mortality as shown in large clinical trials;
and 2) at the population scale, a drug may be antiarrhythmic for one individual but proarrhythmic for another due
to inter-individual variability/diversity and complex environmental differences, which may also account for the
failure of current antiarrhythmic drug therapies. Therefore, for antiarrhythmic drug discovery, one must evaluate
the effects of a molecular intervention or a drug on not just a single arrhythmia mechanism, but all possible
arrhythmia mechanisms. Additionally, one must take into account inter-individual variability and complex
environmental stresses. Our goal is to use mathematical modeling, computer simulation, dynamical theories,
and ""virtual clinical trials"" in our in silico platform that includes normal and diseased human model populations,
and leverage the power of computer modeling and simulation in dealing with complexity to discover novel
effective antiarrhythmic drug targets for arrhythmia prevention and novel ECG markers for risk prediction. Our
central hypothesis is that dynamical instabilities are the major common mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis
regardless of the underlying biological causes, and suppressing dynamical instabilities by targeting the
appropriate dynamical parameters can be effective unified therapies for arrhythmia prevention. There are two
specific aims: 1) To discover effective antiarrhythmic drug therapies and test the hypothesis that targeting certain
dynamical parameters can be effective unified therapeutic targets; 2) To discover optimal clinical markers for
arrhythmia risk prediction and test the hypothesis that dynamically-sensitive ECG properties can be effective risk
predictors. This is a both data-driven and hypothesis-driven proposal which integrates computational modeling
and simulation, dynamical theories, concepts of evolution, experimental and clinical data to translate
computational modeling to clinical medicine. The long-term goal is to generate theoretical results serving as
scientific bases for future expensive and time-consuming experimental studies or clinical trials."
10942268,"ABSTRACT
In brain cancer, tumor cells form complex interactions with cells in the brain. Recent studies have
revealed a complex interaction between brain cells, or neurons, and tumor cells. Specifically, tumor cells
infiltrate healthy brain tissue inducing increased neuron activity and connectivity, particularly among a one
class of brain cells (excitatory neurons), making brain tissue more excitable in the process. This increase
in excitability is thought to act as an accelerant for increased tumor infiltration into healthy neural tissue.
Conversely, another class of neurons, inhibitory neurons, are degraded during tumor cell infiltration. This
feedback loop leads to further spread of tumor into healthy brain tissue, particularly as the excitation-
inhibition balance essential for normal brain function is tipped toward excitation. This imbalance is thought
to be a reason for 40-80% of glioma patients developing epilepsy. However, this detailed, intricate, and
devastating process of tumor infiltration has only been detailed through studies in non-human animals and
in surgically removed tissue samples, with little to no information on how tumor-induced changes alter
activity in the intact human brain. In addition to FDA-approved clinical electrodes, we propose using
cutting edge high-resolution microelectrodes we pioneered for use in the human operating room to
sample brain activity in, around, and far from tumor. We will use two types: 1) microelectrodes with 1000
channels printed on ultrathin materials to conforming to the surface of the brain; and 2) Neuropixels
probes which are microelectrodes which can record single cell activity across >300 channels along a
probe close to the thickness of a human hair. Recording neural activity altered by tumor infiltration
therefore not only offers unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution relative to current clinical
technologies but also fills a scientific gap in capturing ongoing tumor-induced changes in brain activity in
the intact human brain. The goal is to provide a high-resolution dynamic physiological map of the tumor
and the tumor boundary to better understand tumor infiltration in the intact brain working with patients
already scheduled for neurosurgery for the treatment of tumor following fully informed consent. We predict
the tumor boundary can be identified by physiological signatures possibly providing new diagnostic tools
providing high resolution information for clinical decisions in the future."

10943580,"Project Summary
 Primary cilia serve as cellular sensors for rapid detection of environmental changes. These microtubule-
based antennae are expressed on almost all eukaryotic cells across unicellular and multicellular systems and
encompass wide roles in development and homeostasis. In recent years, primary cilia have come into the
limelight in diabetes and metabolism research, as previously unappreciated functions have been attributed to
these organelles on endocrine cells. Recent human genetic and GWAS studies show that cilia have clinically
important roles in metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. In the pancreatic islet, we observe that loss
of cilia disrupts β-cell endocrine functions including glucose-stimulated Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion. Mice
lacking cilia on β-cells develop glucose intolerance and diet-induced diabetes. These findings suggest that
primary cilia mediate glucose responsiveness in normal β-cells, but the molecular drivers of ciliary glucose-
sensing and signaling are unknown. In addition, proteome and metabolome profiling have been done in other
mammalian cilia but not in pancreatic islet β-cells, posing a knowledge gap regarding cilia-dependent regulatory
mechanisms in β-cell glucose metabolism and secretory function. Our preliminary studies identify glycolytic
signaling machinery in β-cell cilia, both by proteomics and with a palette of newly developed biosensors that
monitor the dynamics of ciliary signaling. We further demonstrate that glycolytic fluxes differ between primary
cilia and cytosol in β-cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that compartmentalized glucose
metabolism in β-cell cilia generates signals that regulate ciliary and cellular function. To test this
hypothesis, we will combine genetic loss-of-function models with state-of-the-art proteomic and metabolic
profiling tools, microscopy, electrophysiological recordings, and islet function tests to delineate the mechanisms
by which cilia effect glucose-dependent β-cell functional changes. Aim 1 will leverage strong functional imaging,
proteomic, and metabolomics expertise and promising pilot data to delineate the signaling network by which
primary cilia relay glycolytic information and to comprehensively identify ciliary signaling pathways relevant to β-
cell function. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which cilia regulate β-cell electrophysiological properties
and intracellular metabolic crosstalk leading to insulin secretion. A detailed understanding of these regulations
by primary cilia could support the development of novel therapies to modulate β-cell function in diabetes."
10932843,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the rapid emergence of biophysical tools to detect and characterize conformational
changes in protein structure, studying protein dynamics with high sensitivity and reliability in its
native environment remains a formidable challenge. Laborious sample preparation and
requirement for special equipment present a major obstacle for democratizing these tools. Thus,
a simple yet robust platform for characterizing dynamic changes in protein conformation is highly
demanded. Using azide-containing hypervalent iodine reagents, we have developed a novel
chemoproteomic platform termed Protein Surface Azidation Mass Spectrometry (ProSurA-MS)
that detects conformational changes in proteins with unbiased chemoselectivity. Combined with
bioorthogonal chemistry, ProSurA-MS allows proteome-wide, site-specific profiling of protein
surfaces with wide coverage and reproducibility. ProSurA-MS effectively mapped conformational
changes of purified proteins upon denaturation, protein-small molecule interaction, and protein-
protein interaction. Additionally, ProSurA-MS detected structural changes in a zinc-binding protein
in whole cell lysate upon zinc depletion and measured proteome-wide azidation in live cells,
potentiating the characterization of protein dynamics in complex biological environments. The
herein proposed ProSurA-MS studies will enable i) characterization of dynamic changes in protein
conformation induced by post-translational modifications in response to oxidative stress and
monitoring of the protein dynamics of different genetic variants of a metal transporter (Aim 1), ii)
basic understanding of the chemical mechanism behind the ProSurA reaction and development
of second generation reagents with greater azidation yield and surface coverage (Aim 2), and iii)
establishment of a novel method for the identification of protein-protein interactions based on
protein surface azidation in live cells (Aim 3)."
10932851,"Project Summary
Tight junctions (TJs) at the boundaries of endothelial and epithelial cells are critical in the development and
function of vertebrates because they enable these tissues to separate, protect, and shape external epidermis
and limbs and internal organs and glands. TJs regulate molecular transport through the spaces between
individual cells (paracellular) while adhering cellular sheets. TJs perform two vital functions in tissues: 1) form
barriers to restrict paracellular flux of small molecules, protecting organisms from the external environment and
separating internal body compartments; and 2) creating size- and charge-selective pores, allowing permeability
of ions that maintain electrochemical gradients. Numerous proteins amass at TJs to form the macromolecular
assemblies necessary for barrier and pore function. But two families of membrane proteins—claudins and
TAMPs (TJ-associated Marvel proteins)—predominate TJ assembly, architecture, and function. As these TJ
integral membrane proteins (TJIMPs) are the sole components to span intracellular, intramembraneous, and
extracellular space, they act as cytoskeletal scaffolds and assemble side-by-side within a membrane (cis) and
with TJIMPs from adjacent cell membranes (trans) to form barriers and pores. The molecular structure of TJs
is dynamic. Changes in protein composition, interaction, conformation, or modification—useful for assembling
TJs to precisely tune paracellular transport under normal conditions—can also be mis-assembled, resulting in
pathologies such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, ALS, stroke, food poisoning and
inflammatory bowel disease, renal wasting, hepatitis, and diseases of the skin, eyes, and ears. Molecular level
insights into TJ structure and dynamics; the mechanisms of assembly that govern barrier and pore function;
and how disabling these mechanisms leads to pathologies, remain unresolved matters in our fundamental
understanding of TJs. We propose here a comprehensive research program that uses highly interdisciplinary
approaches to determine structure–interaction–function relationships between TJIMPs at dynamic TJ
microenvironments. These approaches integrate structural biology of TJIMPs and their complexes with
information obtained by traditional and state-of-the-art bioinformatics, biochemical, biophysical, and functional
experiments. The research program intends to resolve the underlying molecular principles of TJ assembly and
disassembly by confronting technical challenges and, in the near-term, by answering specific questions on
TJIMP interaction networks, the basis of gut barrier breakdown by a bacterial toxin, and the mechanisms of
TJIMP form and function at the blood-brain barrier. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the
molecular bases for construction, destruction, and reconstruction of TJs, occurring both naturally or via
disease-causing mechanisms, and to use the achieved insights to advance design and development of novel
therapeutics to remedy TJ-related ailments."
10933663,"Overall Summary
Tumor-microenvironment interactions underlie fundamental features of both tumorigenesis and therapeutics.
Surviving a hostile environment represents profound selective pressure to which aggressive malignancies like
melanoma evolve, in part because the cutaneous melanoma genome is typically riddled by numerous UV
mutations which may be immunogenic. This competing renewal application presents projects born from
collaborative and persistent efforts over the past 10 years (2 cycles) to understand these interactions and
gradually move towards translatable opportunities for patients. Our productivity has been high, with potentially
impactful studies proposed below based upon extensive preliminary data. The P01 collectively published 61
papers in the first 4 years of this cycle, 19 in Nature, Cell, Science, 33 in these journal “families” and 54 containing
multiple P01 labs during the first 2 cycles. Building on deep study of the MITF oncoprotein, Project 1 discovered
MITF regulation of DDI2 protease, a factor found to trigger destruction of MHC-antigen complexes, weakening
immune recognition. DDI2 suppression (genetically or using an FDA approved inhibitor based on cross reactivity
of DDI2’s active site) profoundly upregulates antigen presentation, T cell activation, tumor killing, and in vivo
immune checkpoint inhibition in multiple syngeneic models. Project 2 has generated novel live-imaging
technologies that visualize the in vivo cancer niche, which modulates tumor environment interactions, immunity,
and signaling responses. Project 3 identified CARM1 from an in vivo screen for immune-tumor modulators.
Carm1 is an epigenetic enzyme that negatively regulates T cell function and dendritic cell cross-presentation. To
mechanistically probe and translationally develop these concepts further, the following Aims are proposed.
Project 1 will test if DDI2 inhibition (knockout or drug) boosts only anti-PD1 or also anti-CTLA4, anti-LAG3 or
triple combinations, with tumors subjected to detailed phenotyping. Immunopeptidomics will determine whether
DDI2 inhibition enhances diversity of antigen-peptides presented by MHC, beyond overall MHC-antigen levels.
DDI2 will be tested as a mediator of MITF-induced oncogenic immune evasion. And >200 human melanoma
scRNAseq analyses will be examined to identify patients most likely to benefit from DDI2 targeting. Project 2
will utilize in vivo live imaging to examine immune interactions among cells upon activation of IFN, Wnt and TGFβ
pathways, which are key to tumorigenesis and therapeutic responses. A novel in vivo cell-barcoding technology
will also be deployed to understand clonality and cell function in the cancer niche. Project 3 will utilize highly
defined genetic tools and detailed expression/epigenetic analyses to identify how CARM1 in T cells modulates
an exhausted state, and how in dendritic cells CARM1 antagonizes antigen cross-presentation. The 3 projects
all have detailed components that are integrated with the other PPG teams, and the Pathology and Bioinformatics
Core will provide validation analyses in our large deeply annotated human biopsy collection, including cutting
edge imaging, ‘omics analytics, and computational support. The Administrative Core will oversee all operations."
10934143,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Fetal/Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (FNAIT), is a non-malignant hematologic bleeding disorder
that arises when maternal antibodies specific for fetal platelet alloantigens cross the placenta and remove a
baby's platelets from circulation in the fetal and/or neonatal period. Cases of mild thrombocytopenia often resolve
without incident, but 10-20% of severely thrombocytopenic cases are unpredictably associated with major organ
bleeds such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which can cause irreversible brain damage and death. More than
35 polymorphic Human Platelet Alloantigens (HPAs) on seven membrane glycoproteins have thus far been iden-
tified. Among these, HPA-1a (formerly known as PlA1) is the most clinically significant cause of FNAIT in the US,
being responsible for the vast majority of FNAIT cases, and is most frequently associated with ICH and other
adverse pregnancy complications. Interestingly, studies in a number of laboratories, including ours, have re-
vealed remarkable heterogeneity in maternally-derived HPA-1a-specific alloantibodies, and have reported an
association of specific subpopulations with the severity of FNAIT. Whether such subpopulations actually contrib-
ute mechanistically to the severity of FNAIT by binding to and inhibiting the function of platelets and other
vascular cells, however, is not known. Studies proposed in Project 1 will take advantage of a preclinical animal
model of FNAIT that we recently developed, and a newly assembled battery of epitope-specific human and
mouse alloantibodies. Specific Aim 1 will utilize expertise and technologies available in shared Core B and in
the laboratories of the Leaders of Projects 2 and 3 to characterize in vitro the functional and structural properties
of HPA-1a-specific antibodies that differentially recognize platelet and endothelial cell alloantigenic epitopes, and
test the hypothesis that the presence of specific alloantibody subsets contributes to the severity of FNAIT in vivo.
A second topic to be addressed in this proposal will confront the unexplained discrepancy between FNAIT and
its red cell counterpart, Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN), that has puzzled the field for more
than four decades: whereas red cell alloimmunization primarily occurs as a result of fetal maternal hemorrhage
that occurs at the time of delivery, affecting subsequent pregnancies, >25% of FNAIT cases occur without
warning during gestation of what is experienced as a first pregnancy. Specific Aim 2, therefore will examine
various modes of alloantigen exposure that might lead to maternal alloimmunization to test the hypothesis that
pregnancy complications that give rise to FNAIT are similar to those that cause HDFN, and that undetected,
unnoticed, and unobserved routes of platelet alloimmunization are likely taking place that induce undetected
alloantibody production, even in first gestations. Taken together, these studies will improve our understanding of
the etiology of this alloimmune disorder, and enable more accurate prediction of the severity of FNAIT - all with
the ultimate goal of preventing development of the maternal alloimmune response that causes FNAIT, even in
first at-risk pregnancies."
10931998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Isolating individual cells from mixed populations offers a powerful way to study molecular underpinnings of diseases and
unravel new targets for drug development. Single-cell isolation is also important for directed evolution screens for
engineering biological systems. Despite the growing interest in single-cell isolation techniques from both industry and
academia, current methods have a critical limitation. They fail to isolate individual interesting target cells from tissue or 3D
cultures. Addressing this problem would enable research in a more physiological environment, providing a more accurate
assessment of gene, protein, or cell behaviors and functions. We have recently reported SPOTlight, a versatile all-optical
method for isolating single cells within live cultures based on spatial and temporal properties. In SPOTlight, we optically
tag target cells exhibiting interesting phenotypes through fluorescence photoactivation using a specialized light-patterning
device connected to a microscope. These photoactivated cells, distinguishable by their bright red or green fluorescence, are
then isolated with a FACS machine. However, the current SPOTlight setup relies on a 1-photon widefield microscopy setup,
limiting its utility for 3D samples. The overall objective of this project is to create a 2-photon (2P) microscopy version of
SPOTlight, dubbed 2P-SPOTlight. Our commercialization plan is to provide 2P-SPOTlight as a service to our customers in
industry and academia. In Phase I, we will develop the necessary reagents to allow optical labeling of cells within 3D
cultures using 2-photon light. We will also develop a 2P-SPOTlight assay to isolate spatially distinct subpopulations of
tumor-infiltrating T-cells. We believe this project will satisfy the unmet need to isolate cells from 3D cultures to conduct
downstream spatiotemporal omics."

PROGRAM CODE: RGI
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Research Program in Radiobiology and Genome Integrity (RGI) is an interdisciplinary research effort
exploring radiation biology, clinical and experimental tumor imaging, and basic science investigations into tumor
mechanisms tied to DNA repair and the maintenance of genome integrity. RGI serves as Yale Cancer Center’s
(YCC) engine for scientific discovery in radiobiology and genome integrity research. It is also closely aligned with
the Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Research Program which facilitates the translation of these discoveries to
the clinic. The goals of RGI are strategically aligned with the needs of the YCC catchment, spurred by our
expanding interactions with YCC’s Center for Community Engagement and Health Equity (CEHE). Programmatic
research naturally aligns with YCC priorities, and aims to: 1) Identify new strategies to improve the efficacy or
delivery of radiation therapy and other DNA damaging agents; 2) Elucidate pathways in the etiology and
treatment of cancer that impact genome integrity. Investigations into cancers with etiologies driven by excessive
DNA damage (e.g., tobacco associated) or harboring DNA repair defects (e.g., BRCA mutations) are
representative of investments in YCC high priority cancer targets and cross-cutting research focuses. RGI is
composed of 35 members from 9 different departments within the Yale School of Medicine (YSM). Program
members published 395 papers during this award period, 16% in high impact journals, with inter-programmatic
(37%), intra-programmatic (29%), and intra- plus inter-programmatic (12%) collaborations demonstrating
interactions among RGI members within the Program and across YCC. Funding for this program is robust, with
total cancer-related funding of $10M (direct costs). This includes $7.5M in peer-reviewed funding, of which $3.5M
is from the NCI. Program leaders Joseph Contessa and Megan King foster intra- and inter-programmatic
interactions through YCC and RGI sponsored seminars, meetings, and funding opportunities to initiate and
support research teams that cross-pollinate scientific ideas for translating novel findings in cancer research.
Through our RGI liaisons to CEHE, we share a strategic plan, driving engagement of RGI members towards
enhanced catchment and equity focused research priorities and facilitating dissemination of research findings
back to communities served by the YCC. RGI furthers the mission of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(DEI) through participation and leadership in pipeline training programs to prepare the next generation of RGI
scientists and physicians. RGI also partners with the Cancer Research, Education, and Training Core (CRTEC)
to actively promote recruitment, retention, and success of scientists and clinicians at all career stages. Together
the RGI Research Program provides the infrastructure to nucleate transdisciplinary scientific teams who pioneer
groundbreaking approaches to improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy and for targeting DNA repair
defects in an increasingly broad number of malignant diseases."

The Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) was established in 1995 to provide comprehensive, effective, timely,
and cost-effective biostatistical support to Yale Cancer Center (YCC) investigators who span across the entire
university. It is affiliated with the Yale Center for Analytical Sciences (YCAS), which covers all collaborative
biostatistics efforts at the Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) under one
umbrella and has the YSPH Department of Biostatistics as its academic home. The BSR has a highly
experienced and interactive team of biostatisticians and bioinformaticians who work collaboratively with basic,
clinical, translational, and population science researchers to advance the frontiers of cancer medicine and public
health. The BSR faculty also offer workshops, office consultations, lectures, seminars, Grand Rounds, and
courses on study design, analysis methods, and software implementation to medical students, fellows, research
staff, and faculty. Shuangge Ma, PhD, Professor and Department Chair of Biostatistics with an outstanding
research record in cancer genetic epidemiology, population study, and bioinformatics, has been leading the BSR
since 2016.
During the most recent funding period, we have witnessed a steady increase in the demand for biostatistical and
bioinformatics support. Our biostatisticians have been providing strong and comprehensive support to multi-
investigator large projects (such as the SPOREs), R01-type projects, and developmental/pilot studies. We have
further strengthened bioinformatics support, especially for projects that also have significant biostatistical
components. Ma has served as the gatekeeper for all cancer-related bioinformatics needs for the YCC, to
facilitate collaborations among multiple bioinformatics groups and ensure non-overlapping support. Other
notable accomplishments include added expertise (in protocol review/development, data science, imaging data
analysis, and others), additional infrastructure building, and more effective management.
The Specific Aims of the BSR are to: 1) Provide powerful, comprehensive, and timely biostatistical and
bioinformatics support to all YCC investigators and projects; 2) Further strengthen in the areas of bioinformatics,
clinical trials, and multi-investigator studies; 3) Further reinforce our strong ties with YCC programs, other shared
resources, YSM, YSPH, and cancer biostatisticians/programs nationwide; 4) Develop leading-edge methods and
software to more effectively support cancer research; 5) Provide training in standard and advanced analytic
techniques to cancer students, fellows, research staff, and faculty, via workshops, office consultations, seminars,
Grand Rounds, lectures, and courses.
Over time, the BSR has been established as an essential component of YCC, and it will play an increasingly
important role in the next funding period."
10934207,"The long-term goals of this project are to translate novel findings in the field of immunology into early phase
immunotherapy clinical trials for patients with leukemia. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo
HCT) is a standard treatment for high-risk or relapsed AML and is potentially curative. However, patients who
relapse after allo HCT have a dismal prognosis, and there remains no clearly effective standard therapy.
Mechanisms contributing to failure of the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect include alterations in the AML cells
to avoid immune recognition, compromised antigen presentation, and immune cell exhaustion. Thus, post-HCT
relapse AML patients have a high unmet need for safe and innovative immunotherapies. Ideally, new
treatments will eliminate AML and act in concert with donor T cells to boost GVL. We hypothesize that donor
memory-like (ML) NK cellular therapy will provide 1) immediate NK-GVL effect that will induce AML remissions,
and 2) cytokines (IFN-γ) that rescue T cell-mediated GVL, thereby achieving short-term disease control and
long-term remissions.
 We discovered brief cytokine (IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18) activation results in differentiation of human ML NK
cells, which respond robustly upon restimulation (to AML) and have multiple anti-leukemic advantages
compared to conventional (c)NK cells. Safety (no CRS/ICANS/GVHD) and preliminary AML responses were
observed in our phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) AML. In our previous SPORE clinical trial
project, we demonstrated that augmenting allo HCT with immune compatible HCT-donor ML NK cells early
(Day+7) resulted in early AML remissions and donor ML NK cell expansion and functional persistence for >3
months after a single NK product dose. Here, we propose to test ML NK cells as therapy for adult AML patients
who have relapsed after HCT in an open and accruing phase 2 trial cohort.
 Our prior work also identified NKG2A as a predominant inhibitory checkpoint for ML NK cell responses to
AML, but this has not been thoroughly tested in vivo, nor in the post-HCT relapse setting. While NK activating
receptors recognize many AML blasts, this detection is imperfect, and thought to result in AML resistance.
Leveraging our prior work with ML NK cell chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineering, we are positioned to
test CAR ML NK cells for enhanced ability to eliminate AML.
 In this proposal, we will 1) perform a phase 2 study of same-donor ML NK cell immunotherapy for patients
with AML relapsed after allo HCT, 2) define donor ML NK cell expansion, functionality, and longevity,
mechanisms of AML resistance to NK cell therapy, and impact on T cells in the post-HCT relapse setting, and
3) evaluate NKG2A blockade and CAR engineering combined with ML NK cells. These studies will lead to a
new understanding of mechanisms whereby NK cells effectively attack AML, and whereby AML resists NK cell
therapy, and hence strategies to improve memory-like NK cell anti-AML responses in future clinical trials."

Project 2 – Provider-Patient/Caregiver Racial Concordance and Equity in Health Care Systems: Their
Influence on Health and Healthcare Outcomes for Populations with ADRD
Although more than 16 percent of the US population identifies as Hispanic and 12 percent as Black, less than 6
percent of physicians identify as Hispanic and 5 percent as Black. The proposed project will harness several
decades of Medicare data from rural and urban regions to shed light on the role of patient/provider racial
concordance in driving health outcomes for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) as
well as others. Using novel data sources on physician race and ethnicity, together with quasi-experimental
variation in the “match” that occurs in Emergency Department (ED) settings as well as an instrumental variables
strategy, we will estimate causal impacts of this concordance on healthcare and health, including ED visits for
ambulatory care sensitive conditions, in-patient admissions, readmissions, healthy days in the community,
medication adherence, and mortality. In addition, we will examine factors that mediate those outcomes and how
the effects may change over time. ADRD patients comprise a large fraction of Medicare beneficiaries who present
in EDs and are highly reliant on primary care physicians because of shortages of specialists. Finally, we will
compare the impact of racial (non-)concordance in ambulatory care settings, where greater sorting may occur, to
emergency department settings, where there is quasi-random assignment of patients to providers. Project 2
anchors the Program Project’s focus on racial disparities in care, complementing the work of other projects that
also look at racial disparities in care for ADRD patients and others in other contexts."
10942744,"Several common mechanisms have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The
accumulation of misfolded proteins, microtubule disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, upregulation
of autophagy, and oxidative stress are all known contributors to neurodegeneration. Because there
are currently no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, there is a critical need for
developing new model systems to study neurodegenerative mechanisms in order to identify novel
therapeutic targets. C. elegans has been used as a genetic model to study neurodegeneration
because of its well-defined nervous system and the C. elegans model system enables identification
of common mechanisms in neurodegeneration that are conserved across the animal kingdom. This
project seeks to identify a novel common mechanism in neurodegeneration that has not been
reported before, which is the precocious neuronal differentiation.
We model human congenital hydrocephalus associated human Trim71 genetic variants in C. elegans
neurons by knocking in the de novo p.Arg608His mutation at a homologous position in the C. elegans
lin-41 gene using the CRISPR engineering. lin-41, the C. elegans homolog of Trim71, was identified
as a heterochronic gene that coordinates the temporal sequence of cell division and differentiation
in many C. elegans cell types and tissues. The created lin-41(xr77) mutant allele, like the human and
mouse de novo p.Arg608His mutation in Trim71, causes precocious neuronal differentiation. To our
surprise, it additionally exhibits adult stage early-onset neurodegeneration, which has never been
reported before. Premature neuronal differentiation in lin-41 mutants results in precociously, yet
properly, built neuronal structures, that function normally in young adult stage. Other heterochronic
mutations that cause precocious neuronal differentiation, including lin-14 and lin-28 mutant alleles,
also result in early-onset neurodegeneration. We reason since neuronal structures in these mutants
are built earlier than the normal schedule, they break down earlier, leading to adult stage early-onset
neurodegeneration. We thus hypothesize that the timing of neuronal differentiation and the timing of
neurodegeneration have a strong relationship in heterochronic mutants. This project aims to
determine whether heterochronic perturbations that cause delayed neuronal differentiation result in
a delay in normal age-related neurodegeneration. In addition, we will determine whether the
heterochronic gene lin-14, like the heterochronic gene lin-41, is required and functions during early
development to deter precocious neuronal differentiation, which in turn prevents future adult stage
early-onset neurodegeneration."
10942579,"ABSTRACT
 Infections with Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, have been rapidly rising in the United
States over the past decade and present an increasing threat to public health. However, currently available
diagnostic methods for T. pallidum infection remain suboptimal: they are time consuming, costly, are variably
sensitive and specific for disease, are subject to false positive and false negative results, and are especially
complicated to apply for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. Moreover, most available testing algorithms
require involvement of clinical reference laboratories able to support high complexity testing, increasing the
overhead surrounding testing and the time necessary to achieve a positive or negative diagnostic result. As a
result of both the practical challenges of testing and the inherent diagnostic limitations of available tests, some
diagnoses are missed, and others are not made in a timely fashion, such that patients may be lost to follow-up
before treatment. There is an increasingly urgent need for robust, rapid, low cost, and widely accessible testing
to enable the diagnosis of T. pallidum in adult and congenital contexts. In response to these needs, we propose a
new diagnostic paradigm based on the detection of T. pallidum antigens using aptamers, short ssDNA molecules
that bind to target molecules with equal or greater affinity than antibodies. This innovative approach will enable
ultrasensitive, point-of-care (POC) testing for T. pallidum infections from a variety of specimen types, such that
syphilis can be rapidly diagnosed in adults and babies and appropriate therapy administered in real time. In
our first Aim, we will develop aptamers that strongly and specifically bind T. pallidum proteins having high
value as diagnostic targets. We will then evaluate the performance characteristics of those aptamers by
measuring their sensitivity of binding to cultured T. pallidum strains, and their specificity of binding by
confirming a lack of binding to related treponemal organisms, other genitourinary pathogens, and organisms
from the normal human microbiota. In our second Aim, we will use these aptamers to develop methods and
protocols for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of T. pallidum antigens from clinical specimens. Our strategy
will utilize polymerase-assisted cyclic signal amplification of organism-specific aptamers to generate and
amplify fluorescent signal that can be detected at POC using inexpensive instrumentation. After protocol
optimization, we will perform initial clinical validation of the assay using residual human specimens spiked
with cultured T. pallidum. Our overall goal is to generate an inexpensive, ultrasensitive, and rapid detection
method for syphilis that can be implemented at POC, so that accurate diagnosis of syphilis and administration
of effective therapy can be implemented in the same healthcare encounter."
10997329,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and
long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a
promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals
and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational
models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds
and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity
Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear
mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this
proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the
fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will
be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a
preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone
initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive
models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and
assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets
within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo
experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The
scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all
available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine
learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our
modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for
validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal
for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next
generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of
big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the
implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web-
based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These

 Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of genetic disorders that abrogate T cell development
and function. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the standard treatment for the disease and
can be performed successfully in SCID patients without the high dose pre-HCT busulfan conditioning due to the
unique capacity for progenitors to engraft in the empty thymus and reconstitute T cell development. Without
conditioning, lineages other than T cells remain of host origin. The CSIDE protocol was funded with an earlier
grant to test the efficacy and safety of a regimen of low dose, individualized targeted busulfan compared to
moderate dose in SCID patients at risk of poor humoral outcome undergoing non-matched sibling donor HCT.
We hypothesize that patients randomized to receive low dose busulfan will achieve similar outcomes compared
to those receiving moderate dose (myeloablative) busulfan, achieving both T and B cell immune reconstitution.
Due to COVID and competition with gene therapy, accrual slowed, but with 50 centers open and a redesigned
approach, additional enrollment facilitated by this grant will ensure that the trial reaches meaningful conclusions.
 In Aim 1, patients have been randomized to cumulative area-under-the-curve (cAUC) exposure of busulfan
of 30 mg*h/L versus 60 mg*h/L. IL2RG/JAK3 patients also receive rATG, while RAG1/2 patients receive rATG,
fludarabine, and thiotepa. Stem cell sources include unrelated and haploidentical related donor products that
have been TCRαβ+/CD19+ depleted with no post-HCT GVHD prophylaxis. The safety profile of the trial has
been excellent to date. The original primary endpoint was protective antibody response to tetanus by 2 years
post-HCT. Because of enrollment challenges, we redesigned the primary endpoint into an ordinal ranked win
comparison, which allows higher power even if we cannot fully enroll. The primary outcome will center around
the IL2RG/JAK3 cohort, which should achieve full accrual, randomizing 32 patients. The RAG1/2 cohort will
close once the IL2RG/JAK3 cohort closes, likely accruing up 18-20 patients which we will analyze descriptively.
 In Aim 2, We hypothesize that donor HSC engraftment measured by the surrogate of myeloid donor
chimerism will be associated with superior quality of T cell reconstitution and improved adaptive immune
responses to vaccination. We hypothesize that T cell exhaustion and poor T cell receptor (TRB) diversity seen
in patients undergoing HCT in the absence of conditioning will be diminished or absent in CSIDE participants
due to improvements in thymic output associated with engraftment of donor-derived HSC. We hypothesize that
IL2RG/JAK3 patients receiving moderate dose busulfan and/or with high level donor chimerism will exhibit
multiple in vitro biomarkers of IL-21 response, as this cytokine signals via IL2RG/JAK3. We hypothesize that
vaccine response will correlate with normalization of IGH CDR3 diversity in RAG1/2 patients with mixed
chimerism due to strong selective advantage for antigen-specific B cells. We hypothesize that T cell tolerance
will occur by different mechanisms (central deletion versus peripheral regulation) according to donor type. Finally,
we hypothesize that analysis of pK samples for elements of our preparative approaches (rATG, thiotepa, and
fludarabine) will allow targeted treatment of infants undergoing HCT for SCID or other disorders moving forward."
10930227,"Project Summary
This two-phased randomized controlled trial will examine the implementation and effectiveness
of a cardiovascular health (CVH) intervention on postpartum mothers and young children
through age 3. We will adapt a CVH intervention into an evidence-based home visiting program,
Family Check-Up (FCU) to create FCU-Heart. Through a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation design, the first phase RCT pilot study will test the feasibility and effectiveness
of FCU-Heart (FCU-Heart, n=100; FCU, n=50) (Aim 1a and 1b). A second goal of the hybrid
study is to understand the reach, engagement, and context for implementation of FCU-Heart
and gather information for development of the multi-center home visiting model trial. The second
phase of our study will compare the FCU-Heart to standard FCU outcomes through a
collaborative, multicenter randomized trial (Aims 2 and 3). Our FCU-Heart program is intended
to improve the CVH of high-risk mothers (low-income with cardiovascular risk during
pregnancy—hypertension, diabetes, obesity) compared to the traditional FCU and other home
visiting programs by incorporating individualized, culturally competent interventions that target
diet and exercise, blood pressure control, stress management and self-care, and smoking
cessation. The intervention includes cardiovascular assessment and feedback, followed by a
tailored treatment program delivered by family coaches in 3-4 week modules to establish goals
and track progress. These sessions will work towards obtaining positive CVH outcomes and
empowering mothers of infants to achieve their goals through education and a connection to
resources which we hypothesize will also preserve child CVH. Primary analyses will assess the
impact of FCU-Heart on maternal and child CVH outcomes at child ages 1, 2, and 3 years
compared to FCU Alone. Further, based on the higher rates of CVH complications among Black
women and children, we will examine the effects of FCU-Heart vs FCU alone on maternal and
child CVH racial disparities at the 1-, 2-, and 3-year assessments (Aim 3). This application has
the potential to improve the CVH trajectories of postpartum mothers and young children during a
critical period of their development, providing long-lasting health benefits."

This NIH STRONG-RLI proposal submitted in response to PAR-23-144 is entitled The Future of Rural Health:
Accelerating Biomedical Excellence at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). TTUHSC is a
proud Hispanic Serving Institution. TTUHSC received $12,539,679/year on average in NIH funding in the three-
year period 2020-2022, placing us in the High Research Active category. Established 54 years ago, we are a
comprehensive academic health center that trains health care and biomedical research professionals, conducts
cutting-edge research, delivers comprehensive patient care, and engages in robust community service. We have
5 schools (Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Health Professions, and Population Public Health) and 5 campuses
(Lubbock, Amarillo, Abilene, Midland/Odessa, and Dallas). We serve 108 counties in Texas, representing 50%
(131,000 square miles) of the state’s total land mass and 9.4% (3.1M people) of the total population. Inequities
in access to healthcare and education in our smaller communities carry risks for our nation and the world. The
inhabitants of West Texas generate three commodities (food, fuel and fiber) essential for survival. Research
capacity building with funds from this proposal will address these inequities and help secure a talented workforce
as we increase our research preeminence. Three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will conduct a needs
assessment that incorporates preliminary data and works to optimize the tools and instruments required to gather
new information. We will use risk assessments, SWOT analyses, and evidence-based tools developed by
leading organizations such as the National Council for University Research Administrators. In Aim 2, we will
create an action plan aligned with our values-based culture, execute the plan through our governance structure,
and refine the plan through an iterative process of evaluation and adjustment. The investigative team will focus
on organizational effectiveness through vertical integration (between office of research and associate deans for
research in each of the 5 schools) and horizontal integration (between university-level support units, e.g.,
research, finance, compliance, and information technology offices). Our strategic translational research themes
of cancer, brain health, cardiometabolic, and infectious disease will guide this process. Regular meetings through
our university governance structure including 5 councils (research, academic, clinical, people operations, and
external affairs) will facilitate the achievement of milestones. Aim 3 will foster alignment between the investigative
team and steering committee. Clear and frequent communication between the investigative team and steering
committee, and implementation and refinement of the action plan in concert with the TTUHSC governance
structure, are expected to build research capacity and productivity. After three years of funding, we expect our
efforts will translate into increased extramural funding that leads to a sustained doubling of our NIH funding to

Project 5: Top-down and bottom-up signals for flexible orofacial behaviors (O’Connor as lead)
Orofacial behaviors involve sequences of individual motor actions — such as chewing, licking, swallowing,
breathing, and so forth — that must be tightly coordinated given the essential function they play in sustaining life
and the dire consequences of errors in coordination such as choking or aspirating foodstuffs. In mammals,
orofacial behaviors are also highly flexible and can be altered in real-time based on sensory feedback and
behavioral context, for instance during vocal social communication, biting, and sniffing. How the brain satisfies
the competing demands of tight coordination and high flexibility remains an important unresolved problem. Its
solution will require a quantitative understanding of how high-level cortical circuits interact with the mid- and low-
level hindbrain circuits that mediate orofacial behavior, and how high-level signals for planning and control
interact with low-level sensory feedback signals.
The goals of Project 5 are: (1) to develop a set of licking-based behavioral tasks for mice that have varying
sensorimotor requirements; (2) to quantify descending task-related signals that populations of neurons in
orofacial areas of the cortex send to mid- and hindbrain circuits that control orofacial behaviors; and (3) quantify
ascending feedback signals that may impact high-level control. Project 5 will provide crucial insight into the
dynamics of the circuits for descending control that are studied anatomically in Project 4 and provide constraints
on the models developed in Projects 1 and 2. Results will also establish functional roles of the descending inputs
to the brainstem oscillators studied in Project 3 and the integrative midbrain hubs studied in Project 1."
10931873,"This Phase II SBIR further develops the Oscillated Syringe for Intracranial Injections (OSII) system to deliver
low-force, high-accuracy placement of cannulas for drug and viral vector infusions to the central nervous
system. The project: a) moves the system toward clinical use, including an FDA Pre-submission; and b)
completes testing required to market the device to the neuroscience community as a research tool. Actuated
Medical, Inc. (AMI) will collaborate with key staff at the Oregon Health and Science University and Penn State
University for development and validation tasks, including a critical adeno-associated virus (AAV) study.
Public Health Problem: Treating substance abuse remains a major challenge in the U.S. and worldwide.
Counselling approaches experience high relapse rates. Pharmacological interventions such as Naltrexone are
subject to inconsistent use and are not safe for patients with compromised renal and liver function.
AAV potential: Recent expansion of gene editing tools such as CRISPR, and delivery of stable gene
expressing plasmids through new delivery methods with cell-type specificity, such as recombinant AAVs, have
shown promise for treating previously intractable diseases. Research focused on addiction has produced
promising behavioral changes, but variability in regional AAV expression due to current delivery methods
results in too much uncertainty for clinical viability. This is in part due to needle deflections during insertion, as
well as bolus spread through perivascular spaces and backwards along large needle tracks. New surgical
devices and methods are needed that can achieve the specificity of viral infusion needed for clinical use.
OSII will simplify, standardize, and improve intracranial injections for pharmacology or viral-vector delivery.
Axial vibration of the cannula reduces insertion force and buckling, allowing use of smaller infusion cannula,
reducing damage to regions along the needle track, and minimizing aliquot backflow during needle withdrawal.
Product Innovation: OSII uses electronic control to maintain device oscillation at resonance frequency for long
(up to 30 cm) insertions. Precision tight coupling allows transmission of the vibration to the cannula. Long-
Term Goal: Phase II validates behavioral modification following gene therapy with OSII-delivered vectors in a
preclinical model and conducts an FDA Pre-submission discussion. Future projects obtain an Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE) for first-in-man trials of OSII as a delivery tool to treat addictive behavior.
Aim 1. Advance usability of OSII through development of improved syringe coupling and user control
mechanisms. Aim 2. In vivo validation of neural circuit modulation using OSII-delivered DREADDs. Aim 3. In
vivo validation of behavioral modulation using OSII-delivered DREADDS in attentional set-shift task and
schedule-induced polydipsia paradigms. Aim 4. Confirm safety and efficacy of OSII system through
Verification and Validation (V&V). Conduct Pre-submission discussion with the FDA."
10840301,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairments
and cognitive deterioration. Aging is the major risk factor for AD. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates
that astrocytes and microglia are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E
gene (APOE) has been identified as a major risk factor contributing to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD (SAD)
in about 15-20% of the cases. APOE is the major apolipoprotein expressed in the human brain primarily by
astrocytes and to a lesser extent by microglia, and is involved in cholesterol homeostasis, and regulates A?
clearance. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in genes
enriched in microglia (e.g. SORL1, CR1, CD2AP, CD33, TREM2, ABCA7) and astrocytes (e.g. CLU and
ABCA7) that increase the risk of developing AD. Recent advances in stem cell technology have allowed the
reprogramming of primary cells from human subjects into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their
differentiation in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. However, conventional 2D culture systems fail to
recapitulate the diversity and maturation of multiple cell types and their interaction under physiological and
pathological conditions. To overcome these weaknesses we have developed a novel bioengineered model of
iPSC-derived neural tissue. Our silk-collagen protein-based ‘donut’ scaffolds can support compartmentalized,
3D brain-like tissues over a year, without necrosis. This tissue model is highly innovative, supporting the
differentiating neurons growth in a donut-shaped porous silk sponge within an optically cleared collagen-filled
central region for axon connectivity and synapse formation, that will allow for the first time live in vivo studies
(e.g., cell-based electrophysiology, trafficking, synaptic functionality) of an human AD brain-like tissue during
ageing (months of cultivation) under controlled experimental conditions. More importantly, the architecture of
the scaffolds was optimized to meet the metabolic demand of high-density cell cultures in terms of free
diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, a fundamental requisite for long-term cultures and ageing-related studies.
Thus, we propose to: 1) Assess genotype-phenotype relationship of AD genetic variants enriched in astrocytes
and microglia in patient-derived 3D brain-like cultures; 2) Assess genotype-phenotype relationship of AD
genetic variants in vivo after transplantation of patient-derived cells in mice."

 The Gene and Chromatin Analysis Core provides the technical and bioinformatics infrastructure to
optimally mine the large amount of genome-wide gene expression and chromatin data that are generated from
the PPG’s work. PPG investigators lead the field in several aspects of genome-wide analyses, including
pioneering these approaches to specific cell types in brain, which offers several technical challenges. We use
optimized methods for the most advanced sequencing approaches, including RNAseq, ChIPseq, CUT&RUN,
ATACseq, HiC, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing, among others, for rodent and human brain, the latter
offering an additional set of unique technical challenges. These approaches are being used increasingly to
study individual cells within a given brain reward region as well as individual cells within intact tissue (spatial
transcriptomics), in both rodent and human. The Core has established expertise in analyzing the highly
complex datasets obtained, and works to further improve the tools available. All of the genome-wide data
generated by our PPG are analyzed by this Core. In parallel, the Core runs routine genome-wide assays on
defined animal models with the Animal Models Core, and on brain tissue from humans with substance use
disorders (SUDs), and thereby provides a foundation for the more targeted measures in the individual Projects.
Indeed, each Project focuses on genes that are among the most robustly regulated across rodent addiction
models and human SUDs. As well, the Core pilots novel experimental technologies; an example is locus-
specific epigenome editing to target single chromatin modifications to a single gene within a single brain region
and cell type in vivo, thus providing an unparalleled level of proof to establish transcriptional mechanisms of
addiction. By consolidating the analytical work and routine genome-wide analyses within a centralized Core,
we ensure rigorous control over the data and facilitate comparisons of experimental findings across the four
individual Projects. This consolidation also makes financial sense, as it maximize efficient use of our expertise.
Finally, the Core is responsible, with the Administrative Core, for sharing our genome-wide datasets and
analytical tools across the PPG’s laboratories as well as with the scientific community and lay public at large."
10934810,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
 Project 1 focuses on several transcription factors that mediate the lasting actions of stimulants and opioids
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum. Virtually all prior studies of transcription factors in drug
addiction used a candidate approach. This includes ∆FOSB and CREB, which are among the best studied
transcription factors in addiction and first investigated based on “hunches” of their involvement. This is in
marked contrast to a wholly unbiased approach to deduce, in an open-ended manner, those factors that are
most important in the addiction phenotype. During the first funding period, we utilized this approach by taking
advantage of large-scale RNAseq datasets, from rodent models and humans with SUDs, to identify those
factors predicted to be important for lasting drug actions. Importantly, while these datasets identified numerous
transcription factors not previously implicated in addiction, they also validated a central role for ∆FOSB, CREB,
and other factors studied previously. We confirmed predictions for new factors by defining a cell-type-specific
role for RXRa, E2F3A, ZFP189, and others in mediating cocaine and opioid action in NAc. We now propose to
complete characterization of RXRa, which plays an especially important role and also provides a translational
opportunity based on small molecule antagonists that could be used clinically. Our data show robust actions of
RXRa in NAc neurons in both male and female mice and rats in controlling neuronal physiology as well as
transcriptional and behavioral responses to cocaine and opioids, importantly, including the demonstration that
an RXRa inhibitor reduces motivation to SA cocaine. We will now further characterize RXRa mechanisms by
use of CUT&RUN—enabling the first mapping of transcription factor binding genome-wide in NAc—as well as
the binding of several other factors, notably, ∆FOSB and CREB. Our goal is to identify key target genes for
each factor in a cell-type-specific manner. Finally, Project 1 is building a novel pipeline to link these transcript-
tion factors not only to cell activity in brain slices but also to cell activity in awake, behaving animals and to
downstream effects on the functioning of the broader brain reward circuitry. Together, this work is revealing
fundamentally new transcriptional mechanisms by which cocaine and opioids produce an addicted state."
10934811,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
 Project 2 provides unique characterization of microRNAs in drug addiction, a focus pioneered by my lab.
In previous work, we identified two closely related microRNAs, miR-132 and miR-212, which are encoded by
the same gene and induced in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatal (DS) neurons by cocaine self-
administration (SA). While miR-212 signaling in striatal neurons potently regulates motivational responses to
cocaine, the actions of miR-132 remain unknown. In extensive preliminary work, we discovered a highly novel
mechanism of action for miR-132 in striatal neurons, where its expression is controlled by microglia through
release of the cytokine, TNFα, thus connecting this Project with Project 3. Brain-wide depletion of microglia
dramatically increases cocaine SA and disrupts extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior. As well, such microglia
depletion disinhibits neuroplasticity-related transcriptional programs in NAc neurons, including programs
regulated by miR-132 and by drug exposure in mice and humans. TNFα downregulates AMPA receptor
(AMPAR) signaling in striatal neurons via a mechanism that requires miR-132, and local application of TNFα
into NAc abolishes cocaine-seeking, while disruption of miR-132 signaling in NAc neurons enhances AMPAR
signaling and increases cocaine-seeking. We will now test our hypothesis that microglia—acting in part via
TNFα—control miR-132 signaling in NAc neurons to oppose the physiological and behavioral actions of
cocaine. We are using a single-cell spatial transcriptomics platform to define subregions of NAc and DS that
respond to cocaine in a microglia-dependent manner. We will perform initial studies with opioids as well, where
we expect shared actions of the two drugs. We will then delete miR-132 selectively from NAc or DS neuronal
subtypes and determine miR-132’s role in controlling the neurophysiology of the neurons and in mediating the
protective effect of TNFα. We will next use HITS-CLIP to identify mRNAs that are regulated by miR-132 in
these neurons in a drug- and microglia-dependent manner. This will identify prioritized mRNAs that we will link
back to changes in cell and synaptic physiology and SA behavior. This proposed scheme is innovative
because microRNA involvement in microglia protection against cocaine action has not been explored."
10934812,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
 Project 3's objective is to address the role of microglia in modulating transcriptional adaptations in nucleus
accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS) neurons triggered by cocaine or opioid exposure. Microglia
contribute to normal brain development and function by supporting neuronal survival and removing non-
functional neurons and synapses. We found—with Project 2—that ablation of microglia increases behavioral
responses to cocaine and to opioids, including drug self-administration (SA). These findings support the
hypothesis that microglia may function homeostatically to oppose conditions of excessive dopaminergic
transmission, such as seen with cocaine or opioid exposure. We have found as well that 10-15% of microglia in
striatum, but not other brain regions, express the D1 receptor (D1R), raising the novel possibility of direct
effects of drug (via increased dopaminergic transmission) on microglia, a possibility for which we now have
robust evidence. As next steps, we propose to fully characterize the influence of microglia in controlling neural
and behavioral responses to cocaine and opioids in mouse models. This will include delineating a role for all
microglia in striatum as well as the selective role played by D1R+ microglia and by D1 receptor signaling within
those microglia. We will next characterize the influence of microglia—again D1R+ and D1R- subpopulations—
on the ability of cocaine or opioids to influence gene expression profiles in the major neuronal cell types of NAc
and DS. This work includes characterizing a mechanism involving adenosine signaling that bidirectionally
couples microglia to striatal neuron functioning. As well, we will characterize changes in gene expression
induced by drug exposure in D1R+ and D1R- subpopulations of microglia themselves within striatum. These
experiments are made possible by several novel lines of genetic mutant mice that enable the selective
manipulation of microglial subpopulations within striatum combined with RNAseq of isolated neuronal and
microglia cell types, including at the single cell level. These investigations of cocaine and opioids in mice set
the stage for follow up studies of humans with substance use disorders. Overall, this Project is providing
paradigm-shifting information about the role of microglia in the pathophysiology of drug addiction."
10934813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4
 The objective of Project 4 is to characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of opioid use
disorder (OUD) with a focus on dorsal striatum (DS) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), two key brain reward
regions. In all prior molecular studies of the human OUD brain, we analyzed isolated neurons vs. non-neuronal
cells, which displayed major differences in opioid action. We are now advancing this effort by performing
multiomic analyses at the single-cell level, using single nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) and snATACseq. Since
genetic tags are not possible in humans, such single-cell approaches offer the only available means of
studying individual cell populations (e.g., D1 vs. D2 medium spiny neurons) in the human brain. We are
performing equivalent single-cell studies on DS and NAc of rats that self-administer (SA) an opioid drug across
multiple phases of drug intake including relapse. These temporal assessments are instrumental in guiding
analysis of human tissue. Our proposed experiments incorporate not only heroin, which our group has studied
extensively, but also fentanyl given its current dominance in OUDs and the virtual complete lack of information
about neurobiological aspects of fentanyl use in humans. Overlaying the human and rat snRNAseq and
snATACseq data with sequencing datasets on bulk DS and NAc or on sorted neurons from these regions, as
well as with sequencing datasets available from the PPG’s work on mouse SA models, provides insight into the
most important mechanisms underlying abnormal gene expression associated with OUDs. With this approach,
our research has identified PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) as one of the strongest-implicated
mediators of molecular pathology in DS and NAc across the three species. Based on these deductions, we are
now examining the causal role of PRC2 in opioid-induced behavioral and transcriptional abnormalities by use
of viral and genetic mouse tools already validated in PPG laboratories. We are also studying PRC2’s role in
opioid-induced regulation of the dendritic morphology of striatal D1 and D2 neurons. Given the prominent
development of PRC2 inhibitors for the treatment of specific cancers, characterization of PRC2 contributions to
OUDs offers a translational opportunity to advance novel therapies for drug addiction."
10935739,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)
In the past two decades, the recognition that aberrant activation of kinases plays a critical role in the
pathogenesis of cancers, has stimulated efforts to develop kinase inhibitors for therapy. However, kinase
inhibitors (KI) can lead to adverse cardiovascular effects, either due to the inhibition of the intended kinase target
(“on-target”) or another kinase (“off-target”). Existing needs in the field include understanding the paradigm of
“on-target” versus “off-target” and the need for generating a pre-clinical model to model drug toxicity in patients.
Project 1 of this PPG will focus on establishing pre-clinical models of covalent kinase inhibitor-associated
cardiotoxicity and attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms of toxicity. Specifically, ibrutinib (a first in-
class covalent KI) is associated with arrhythmia (especially atrial fibrillation), representing a unique and novel
toxicity. In Aim 1, we will utilize cell-based and novel genetic tools to examine that ibrutinib cardiotoxicity is
mediated via an “off-target” kinase, C-terminal Src Kinase (CSK). In Aim 2 we will use mouse models to show a
critical role for CSK in cardiotoxicity and test an additional hypothesis that ibrutinib treatment leads to cardiac
remodeling which further contributes to electrophysiologic effects. Aim 3 will use our clinical/pharmacovigilance
databases to corroborate our pre-clinical findings to clinical space.
There is considerable synergy with Project 2 of this PPG (led by Dr. Joseph Wu), which seeks to identify risk
factors for ibrutinib-associated cardiotoxicity, as well as Project 3 (PI: Dr. Mark Mercola), which hopes to develop
cardioprotective medications for KI-associated cardiotoxicity. Although the 3 projects will focus on ibrutinib and
other BTK inhibitors, the platforms created can be applied to the many novel covalent and noncovalent KI that
are being approved in oncology."
10942766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When you reach for an apple and miss, you immediately make corrective submovements to make contact. And
after contact, precise touches at your fingers reshape your grasp. Unknowingly, our tongues move with similar
sophistication during speech and as we use the tongue’s sense of touch to handle, chew, and swallow food.
Tongue discoordination in systemic neurological diseases results in aspiration pneumonia, a leading cause of
death in Parkinson’s and ALS. But because tongue movements are extremely fast and hard to measure, neural
mechanisms of tongue control have been understudied. Here we combine high speed videography and deep
learning guided segmentation to quantify tongue kinematics with millisecond timescale precision. Next we
develop new behavioral paradigms inspired by primate target-jump reach-and-grasp tasks (Aim 1). As with the
primate limb, when the mouse tongue undershoots an unexpectedly withdrawn target (water spout), it
immediately produces corrective submovements to make contact. And as with a grasping hand, when the
mouse nicks a moved spout with the left or right side of its tongue, it immediately redirects the lick left or right
for better contact. To identify signals and circuits underlying these corrections, we combine brainwide neural
recording and manipulation (Aim 2). So far, neural recordings identify representations of misses, nicks, and
aimed corrections in single neurons and neural population dynamics in multiple brain regions. Miss-guided
corrections are impaired by both cortical and cerebellar inactivations. But mechanisms of touch-guided
corrections are fundamentally different. The ability to re-steer a tongue after a nick is impaired by inactivation
of superior colliculus, but not tongue-jaw sensory cortex (TJS1), tongue jaw motor cortex (TJM1), orofacial
premotor cortex (ALM), or a lick-associated region of cerebellum (fastigial nucleus). This double dissociation
suggests that touch-guided tongue steering may use midbrain pathways associated with visually-guided
orienting. To test this idea (Aim 3), we combine neural tracing, tongue surface receptive field mapping, and
optical microstimulation across precise locations of the colliculus. Our pilot data support the existence of a
topographically ordered tongue touch-to-tongue steering map on the surface of the colliculus which essentially
re-purposes both the logic and the layout of more commonly studied visually-guided saccades. In sum, our
goals are twofold: First our proposed research will finally clarify which aspects of the extended motor system
are important for which aspects of sensorimotor tongue control. Second, by comparing our findings to what’s
known sensorimotor processes underlying reaching and orienting, we aim to distinguish idiosyncratic solutions
to narrower sensorimotor control problems from general principles that hold across effectors and species."

The goal of this project is to explore a role for the bone marrow (BM) immune system in the pathogenesis of
idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) and uncover key immune signatures of the disease. Inflammation and
immune system activation have long been considered the major culprits of idiopathic NS, yet the underlying
mechanisms are still poorly understood. Primary focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most
common causes of non-familial idiopathic NS in adults. While it is often responsive to immunosuppressive
therapy, in many cases patients experience a progressive loss of renal function. Moreover, about 30~50% of
FSGS cases recur in newly transplanted kidneys. While its incidence keeps rising, there is no cure for FSGS,
and current treatment options are non-specific and often cause significant side effects. Thus, there is an urgent
need to identify the immune factors and relevant mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically to treat
idiopathic NS such as FSGS and prevent recurrence of the disease.
 We recently discovered that BM-derived immature myeloid cells are a main source of circulating soluble
urokinase receptor (suPAR) and contribute to proteinuric kidney diseases such as FSGS. These findings suggest
that the BM is not simply a place for blood cell production, but is also a central and upstream regulator of kidney
function by acting as the source of soluble factors such as suPAR. Consistent with results seen in mice, our
preliminary data shows that patients with ESRD have high levels of TNFa and suPAR in both plasma and BM,
reflecting a status of chronic inflammation. Moreover, these patients exhibit myeloid-biased hematopoiesis and
show a robust increase in inflammatory CD14+CD16+ BM monocytes that are found to predominantly express
uPAR. In vitro assays show that TNFa skews hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation towards monocytic
lineage cells at the expense of granulocyte production. Along with the altered myelopoiesis, we found that TNFa
markedly increases uPAR expression, suPAR secretion, and promotes production of proinflammatory cytokines
including TNFa, IL-8, and IL-6.
 Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that inflammatory signals alter BM myelopoiesis
leading to renal injury in certain forms of glomerular diseases and that this can be treated or reversed by
correcting the inflammation-driven BM alteration. To test this hypothesis, we will precisely define the nature of
the BM immune alteration in renal disease (Aim 1), determine how the BM immune factors drive renal injury
(Aim 2), and test if BM correction improves renal function (Aim 3). Importantly, the identification of immune
factors and relevant mechanisms in patients diagnosed with kidney disease will improve the current stratification
of the disease and help to develop novel therapies for certain forms of proteinuric kidney diseases currently
categorized as ‘idiopathic’."

Tremendous progress has been made in defining Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated cell types by single-cell
sequencing approaches, such as scRNA-seq. However, the nucleic-acid–based methods are blind to proteins.
Therefore, AD’s proteome and post-translational modifications (PTMs) remain largely unknown. Another
limitation of single-cell sequencing is that the standard cell isolation techniques damage the fine projections of
brain cells, such as the dendrites of neurons. Missing biomolecules in these brain-cell-specific structures will
seriously mislead our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD progression. There is an urgent need for
new technologies to fill the technical gaps in the proteomics and multiomics analysis of AD. Here, we bring to
the AD field our NIH Director’s New Investigator Award-winning method, Gel-based Optical-isolation 3D (GO3D)
multiomics. It can precisely dissect tiny projections of brain cells from whole-mount brains for subsequent mass
spectrometry analysis and next-generation sequencing. This method is an ideal approach to achieving my long-
term goal: creating a single-cell-type multiomics map of AD. As the first step, this project focuses on one critical
AD-associated cell type, the astrocyte. We will use GO3D single-cell-type multiomics to identify AD-associated
proteins and PTMs in astrocytes (Aim 1) and establish a multiomics map of AD featuring astrocytes (Aim 2).
5xFAD mouse models at different time points will be used to examine AD in the early, middle, and late stages.
Human prefrontal cortex tissues will be used to validate key discoveries made from mice. Unbiased profiling of
the proteins together with RNAs and chromatin accessibility in astrocytes will provide a list of AD-associated
proteins and PTMs and their regulatory mechanisms, and thus will greatly advance our understanding of the
molecular basis of AD."

Metabolic dysfunction Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, yet treatment options are limited. Within hepatocytes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as a crucial hub for protein and lipid metabolism. Substantial evidence shows that dysfunction of hepatic ER, characterized by loss of its adaptive capacity, is a key mechanism involved in metabolic deterioration in MAFLD. However, the exact mechanisms underlying ER dysfunction in this condition are unknown. Recently, work from our lab has revealed a new angle: obesity leads to a marked loss of hepatic ER architectural organization, which significantly impacts its function. Moreover, recovering ER structure is sufficient to improve ER function and metabolic health in obese mice. Our long-term goal is to understand how alterations in ER architecture affect its function and the functionality of ER-interacting organelles; and how dysregulation of ER architecture leads to metabolic dysfunction in the liver. Our preliminary data show that fasting induces remodeling of hepatic rough ER sheets, which forms a curved membrane around the mitochondria, a structure regulated by the protein Ribosome Receptor Binding Protein (RRBP1). Obesity leads to loss of this response mainly due to downregulation of RRBP1. Moreover, RRBP1 gain of function reduces hepatic steatosis in obese mice. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that RRBP1- driven rough ER sheet-mitochondria interaction in fasting allows the mitochondria to regulate key adaptive processes such as fatty acid oxidation. Lack of this response in obesity leads to metabolic dysfunction. We will test our hypothesis by: 1) Delineating the requirement of RRBP1-driven rough ER sheet-mitochondria interaction for hepatocyte adaptation to nutritional challenges; 2) Unraveling the mechanisms through which rough ER sheet-mitochondria interactions regulate organelle function and 3) Determining the importance of ER architectural remodeling for the development of diet-induced fatty liver disease. Under the first aim, we will thoroughly characterize the impact of liver specific RRBP1 loss and gain of function on liver metabolism in mice. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that rough ER-mitochondria proximity allows mitochondria to adapt to fasting. In the third aim, we will use FIB-SEM imaging and machine learning-based organelle segmentation to determine the impact of diet-induced fatty liver disease on ER structural remodeling in mice and in humans. We will also test if targeting ER structure by overexpression of RRBP1 can improve metabolic stress in MAFLD. This work opens a novel dimension in the field by unraveling how organelles reprogram their metabolic output and optimize their function by reorganizing their subcellular architecture in response to nutritional challenges. It also has the potential to unravel new therapeutic targets to treat fatty liver disease."
10942512,"Project Summary
Senescence and the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) have long been implicated in driving
tumorigenesis. However, the pro-tumorigenic mechanism(s) of senescence are still not fully understood, pointing
to a need for better model systems to study the role of senescence in tumorigenesis. We recognized that a breast
cancer model that used irradiation of cleared mammary fat pads followed by implantation of syngeneic Comma-
D cells could be an ideal system to study senescence effects on tumorigenesis. Implantation of Comma-D alone
does not result in outgrowth of tumors, but requires pre-irradiation of the gland for tumorigenesis. Similarly,
treatment of the mammary fat pad with chemicals prior to implantation can also drive tumorigenesis. Both these
types of treatments are also known to induce senescence, and indeed we found that irradiation induces massive
senescence in the tissue. Thus, we hypothesize that tumorigenesis in this model system relies on induction of
senescence to drive tumor formation, and that targeting the senescent cells or specific SASP factors will impair
tumorigenesis. We propose to study this model system further to show that tumorigenesis requires induction of
senescence in two specific aims. In the first aim, we will treat irradiated animals with senolytic drugs to remove
senescent cells prior to implantation of SCp2 and other mammary cells, and compare tumor incidence in this
group to a control arm that are treated with vehicle alone. Our preliminary data indicates that targeted removal
of senescent cells with navitoclax blocks tumor formation. Extension of our studies will establish that senescence
can drive early tumorigenesis in multiple models. In the second aim, we will examine how senescence drives
pre-neoplastic cell growth, survival, and differentiation in vivo using multiplex immunofluorescence. We will
perform RNAseq to identify SASP factors that are upregulated in response to irradiation. We will test these
factors for their ability to enhance growth of SCp2 and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) in vitro. SASP
factors that enhance growth and survival of these cells will be selected for targeting to determine their role in
tumor formation. We will use small molecule inhibitors of receptors or interfering antibodies for SASP factors to
determine how blocking these putative growth promoting factors impacts tumor formation. Successful completion
of these studies will establish whether tumorigenesis in a luminal mammary cell implantation system is driven by
senescence, will identify mechanisms by which senescence drives tumorigenesis, and will demonstrate the
ability of senolytics or small molecule inhibitors targeting SASP factors to impair tumorigenesis. These represent
the first steps in gaining mechanistic understanding of the role of senescence in early mammary tumorigenesis,
with a long term goal of developing anti-senescence approaches for the prevention or treatment of human breast
cancer."
10941781,"Research in the Zha Lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute focuses on creating biomimetic materials and
processes that aid in studying, diagnosing, preventing, and treating disease. By leveraging the self-assembly
capabilities of rationally designed biomacromolecules, this research aims to create hierarchically structured
systems that are multifunctional.
 This MIRA R35 for Early Stage Investigators project will support the exploration and development of new
approaches for enhancing the function of biomedical and biological interfaces. The approaches are based on an
interfacial phenomenon recently reported by the PI, whereby robust nanothin coatings are generated non-
covalently on surfaces by controlling the self-assembly of structural proteins such as silk fibroin. These coatings
can transform the physicochemical properties of a wide range of substrates under biocompatible conditions,
regardless of surface chemistry or topography and without specialized equipment. The research program will
explore coatings that: i) exhibit dynamic behavior mimicking the temporal complexity of cell signaling in biological
processes, ii) shield surfaces against unwanted macromolecular and cellular interactions, iii) improve
biocompatibility and bioactivity of cell-material interfaces, and iv) present or release bioactive payloads in a
sustained, controlled manner.
 While the innovations developed by the research program are disease-agnostic and will have the potential
to address a wide range of biomedical challenges, three proof-of-concept topics using model systems will be
examined in this project. 1) Coatings with temporally orchestrated release of multiple neurotrophic factors will be
developed to control Schwann cell phenotype for nerve tissue regeneration. 2) Antifouling peptide motifs will be
discovered by combinatorial synthesis and machine learning to generate coatings that improve the long-term
performance of implanted biosensors. 3) Surfaces of living cells will be engineered by interfacial protein self-
assembly to enhance their viability and bioactivity in therapeutic applications. The outcomes of this research
program are expected to broadly yield versatile, modular tools for biomaterials development."
10943147,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone malignancy in the pediatric population. Overall survival rates
remain about 65-75% and are significantly worse for patients with metastatic or refractory/relapsed disease,
often with long-term outcomes of less than 30%. The Wnt-signaling pathway and its downstream transcriptional
activator β-catenin are involved in a myriad of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and
oncogenesis. In OS, aberrant Wnt-pathway signaling results in uncontrolled transcription of Wnt target genes
that promote growth and metastatic spread. When the Wnt pathway is activated, β-catenin is free to interact with
transduction beta-like protein 1 (TBL1) and/or its highly related family member TBLXR1. TBL1 protects beta-
catenin from nuclear degradation and forms a TBL1/β-catenin complex that mediates transcription of Wnt target
genes. Overexpression of TBL1XR1 and nuclear beta-catenin are positively related to adverse
clinicopathological features and poor prognosis for patients with OS. Tegavivint is a first-in-class small molecule
inhibitor that selectively binds TBL1, thereby inhibiting TBL1/β-catenin complex formation. Importantly, this
occurs without inhibiting normal physiological roles of β-catenin in the cell membrane. We previously
demonstrated that single agent Tegavivint inhibited tumor growth and suppressed lung metastasis, which directly
led to the development of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed pediatric solid tumors
(NCT04851119). Subsequently, using our OS syngeneic models, we have evidence that Tegavivint alters the
OS immunosuppressive microenvironment by increasing cytotoxic T cell and NK cell infiltration. Finally, we have
recently completed a combination drug screen with Tegavivint and identified clinically applicable and molecularly
rationale synergistic probe compounds, including multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and HDACs. We will execute
three independent, yet complementary aims with our overall objectives to (1) identify and transcriptionally
characterize the clonal evolution of Tegavivint-resistant OS cells, (2) assess rationale combinatorial therapeutic
regimens that can quickly be translated to the care of high-risk sarcoma patients, and (3) identify the effects of
targeting TBL1/β-catenin on the evolution of the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Aim1. Identification
of subpopulations and molecular profiling of Tegavivint resistant OS cells. Use of cellular barcoding and scRNA-
Seq profiling of longitudinally Tegavivint treated in vivo models to define specific transcriptional states and
emergence of cell states. Aim 2. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to assess the efficacy, and toxicities of mono- and
combination therapy on high-risk OS. Aim3. Effects of genetic and pharmacologic targeting of TBL1/β-catenin
on the tumor microenvironment. We will dissect the longitudinal effects of targeting β-catenin/TBL1 signaling on
TiME, immune cell constituents and gain insights into mechanisms of immune exclusion. The results will provide
insights into mechanisms of resistance to Tegavivint and pre-clinical justification for rational combinatorial
therapeutic approaches for future trial development to treat high-risk pediatric cancer patients."
10942065,"Understanding the biology of cancer metastases is critical to improving the treatment of cancer. A key challenge
in these efforts has been the lack of cancer models that can recapitulate metastasis biology, especially organ-
specificity, a hallmark of cancer metastasis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel
models of cancer metastasis that can reflect organ specificity of tumor metastasis. Our group has been applying
tissue engineering technologies to develop in vitro engineered cancer metastasis model. We hypothesized that
decellularized tissue can recapitulate the organ microenvironment of cancer metastasis and can be utilized as
strata for culturing tumor cells. We used an innovative decellularization technology, where the process retains
soluble extracellular proteins in the organs (decellularized tissue are termed biomatrix), to engineer cancer
metastasis. Using multiple cancer cell lines, we found that tumor cells can spontaneously form colonies on
biomatrices that are common sites of metastasis (“good soil”/liver and lung). Importantly, the biology of these
tumor colonies and treatment response reflect organ-specificity. We were also able to culture circulating tumor
cells from patients using liver and lung biomatrices. Excitingly, we also found that tumor cells were unable to
proliferate on “bad soil” biomatrices. Further study also revealed that the soluble matrix proteins are largely
responsible for the lack of proliferation of tumor cells on these biomatrices. Based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that we can develop an in vitro cancer metastasis model system using biomatrices and this model
system can reflect organ-specificity. We further theorize that our proposed model of cancer metastasis
represents a powerful tool for cancer biology research and hold high potential for precision oncology. In this
application, we aim to further develop and validate our metastasis model. We plan to use kidney cancer as a
disease model. Kidney cancer was chosen because its unique metastatic pattern: it can metastasize to organs
that are rarely sites of metastasis, such as pancreas. Our proposal has 3 specific aims. The first aim will generate
a comprehensive panel of biomatrices to model sites of cancer metastasis. We will conduct validation studies to
confirm the model system can recapitulate organ-specificity. Second aim will focus on demonstrating the
biomatrix metastasis model’s ability to improve precision oncology. Last aim will focus on identifying soluble
matrix proteins that prevent metastasis formation. Success with our research will result in powerful new tools for
cancer research."
10943551,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to develop new methods for the global identification of protein and RNP interactions with nascent
unspliced RNA in human cells. We will use these methods to produce comprehensive binding site maps for
several important molecules in splicing. In previous work, we isolated proteins and RNP’s from the chromatin
fraction of cells to identify a new complex of splicing regulatory proteins, Rbfox/LASR, as well as a new U2
snRNP complex containing novel regulatory proteins. We further found that sequencing the pre-mRNA
fragments bound within both these complexes allows the comprehensive mapping of their transcriptome-wide
interactions. This “IPseq” mapping of U2/pre-mRNA interactions provides sensitive detection of intron
branchpoints across the expressed transcriptome. We now propose to apply IPseq to develop binding maps of
several key splicing components. We will continue ongoing studies of Rbfox/LASR and the U1 snRNP, and we
will apply the method to the early spliceosome component: U2AF2. In preliminary data, we find that IPseq
generates precise maps of the binding of both Rbfox1 and the LASR subunits on pre-mRNAs. Analyses of
these data will yield important understanding of how the large Rbfox/LASR complex interacts with RNA, and
how individual bound elements cooperate to generate a splicing regulatory code. The U1 snRNP recognizes
the 5’ splice during early spliceosome assembly, binds within splicing silencer elements, and also acts to
suppress premature cleavage/polyadenylation events in nascent RNA transcripts. Genomewide information on
U1 snRNP binding is very limited, and the global analysis of its many RNA interactions will provide new
insights into its multitude of functions. The U2AF heterodimer binds the 3’ splice site during early spliceosome
assembly and is essential for the formation of an exon definition complex. A combined map of U1 snRNP and
U2AF binding sites will allow their assessment as parts of possible cryptic exons and allow better prediction of
mutational activation of cryptic splicing. By building a comprehensive map of the key factors for exon definition,
our goal is to enable better prediction of pathogenic mutations affecting splicing. Finally, we believe that
chromatin RNA IPseq can be broadly applied to many other cellular components."
10943165,"Abstract. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating chronic joint disease, causing functional disability, severe
pain, joint deterioration, and substantial socioeconomic burdens. Presently, there is no cure for RA. While some
patients manage RA with methotrexate and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), around
40% do not respond. Even with biologic treatments, 6-21% RA patients are unresponsive. Thus, a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms of RA pathogenesis is crucial for developing effective treatments for RA
patients. In RA, synovial macrophages (MΦs) are abundant and major sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines
like TNFα, IL1, and IL6, contributing to RA pathogenesis. By analyzing single-cell RNA-seq databases of human
synovial tissues from RA patients and mouse synovial MΦs in CAIA model, we discovered a significant reduction
in INPP5E expression. INPP5E, a 5-phosphatase, dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, known
for regulating the immune response and MΦ phagocytosis via PIP3/PI3K/AKT signaling. However, the role of
INPP5E in regulating MΦs, RA pathogenesis, and its potential as a drug candidate remain poorly understood.
Our preliminary data showed INPP5E deletion in MΦs worsened inflammation and bone destruction in a mouse
CAIA model, while overexpression of INPP5E inhibited inflammation in IL1 induced MΦs. Moreover, we found
that INPP5E associates with Aurora kinase A (AURKA), and overexpression of INPP5E suppressed NF-κB and
DNA damage markers like H2AX and ATM/ATR phosphorylation. Proteomics results indicated INPP5E affects
oxidative reduction, inflammation, NF-κB signaling, and DNA repair, suggesting anti-RA potential. Moreover, to
overexpress INPP5E in RA MΦs, we developed novel F4/80 Ab Fab'-functionalized LNPs (Ab-LNPs) for INPP5E
mRNA delivery. Our preliminary data showed that these LNPs can accumulate and target synovial MΦs and can
effectively express GFP and INPP5E mRNA. Our preliminary data support two key hypotheses: 1) Macrophagic
INPP5E inhibits RA pathogenesis by regulating AURKA/AKT/NF-κB and DNA damage/ATM/ATR signaling
pathways; 2) Introduction of INPP5E through a novel targeted LNPs carrying INPP5E mRNA mitigates RA
pathogenesis. To test hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will test if deletion or overexpression of INPP5E in MΦs
significantly alter inflammation and bone erosion in CAIA model. We will explore pathomechanisms by
characterizing AURKA/AKT/NF-κB, DNA damage/ATM/ATR and other INPP5E downstream signaling pathways.
We will further characterize INPP5E interacting proteins and their function by performing mass spectrometry
and RNA interference analysis. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that targeted delivery of INPP5E mRNA to MΦ
using a novel F4/80 Ab conjugated mRNA LNPs platform can effectively attenuate RA in acute and chronic RA
mouse models. The completion of the proposed project is expected to reveal the novel role and mechanism of
INPP5E in RA pathogenesis and provide a novel targeted nanoparticle mRNA therapy for RA and other
inflammatory diseases."
10942095,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One in every 3 persons develops atrial fibrillation (AF) in their lifetime, and AF affects at least 10% of adults aged
≥65 years. Stroke prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants (OAC) is recommended, but half of older adults who are
eligible for OAC are not treated because of concerns for major bleeding. Treatment with OAC is even less
frequent in adults with frailty, who have excess risk for major bleeding but also for ischemic stroke. To reduce
AF risks in vulnerable populations, left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) was approved by Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) and is recommended by practice guidelines to provide AF stroke prevention for
individuals deemed unsafe for long-term OAC. However, given its short-term procedural complications and life-
long requirement for antiplatelet therapy, the overall benefit of LAAO among adults with frailty is unknown. In
fact, because LAAO’s efficacy and safety were established against OAC in randomized controlled trials (RCT)
of OAC-eligible patients, LAAO’s effectiveness and safety remain uncertain for the population most likely to
benefit—patients with frailty or OAC ineligibility—resulting in a critical evidence-practice gap. The long-term goal
of our AF Outcomes Research program is to improve evidence-based, patient-centered care for older adults with
AF. To this end, our current objective is to evaluate utilization and outcomes of LAAO compared to therapeutic
alternatives in older adults with frailty. We will utilize multiple real-world data sources and apply advanced causal
inference methods to enhance generalizability and the validity of inference. In Aim 1 we will determine
characteristics of older adults who received LAAO and characterize concordance of LAAO use with CMS
approved and guideline recommended indication. In Aims 2 and 3 we will determine effectiveness, safety, and
net benefit (home time) of LAAO compared to OAC and no OAC, respectively. In absence of RCTs, the proposed
research will be the main source of evidence for guiding rational use of LAAO in vulnerable populations."
10942098,"Infectious diseases and microbiology continue to be areas of pivotal importance in health care research.
Infection remains a major cause of mortality worldwide and poses serious problems of both individual and
public health concern in the United States. New pathogens have emerged, including some (COVID-19, Zika)
with catastrophic impact worldwide. Antibiotic resistance continues to occur at an alarming rate among all
classes of mammalian pathogens. Diseases once thought to be near eradication - for example, tuberculosis,
cholera, and rheumatic fever—have rebounded with renewed intensity. Currently in its 45th year, the Infectious
Disease and Basic Microbiological Mechanisms training program maintains as its primary goal the training of
scientists who have a career goal of solving medically relevant problems and who elect rigorous laboratory or
translational training in any of the Harvard adult infectious disease programs or other institutions participating
in this program. Over the past 45 years, the program has successfully trained leaders in academic medicine
and investigators who have made important contributions to the field.
In this competing renewal application, we propose an additional five years of funding. We request six
postdoctoral trainee slots per year. We will use these slots to provide support directly to selected infectious
disease physician fellows (M.D. and M.D.-Ph.D.) during mentored research, and to also provide support to
selected Ph.D. trainees in Harvard Medical School infectious disease and microbiology laboratories focused on
areas that have significant clinical relevance, so as to support the rich research training environment for
physician-scientists within these laboratories and to provide these Ph.D. trainees intensive exposure to
medically-trained clinically-active researchers. Training will include a minimum of two years of mentored
research with hands-on in-laboratory training, appropriate advanced non-degree-granting post-graduate
coursework, attendance and participation of trainees at regular meetings and seminars of direct relevance to
infectious disease and microbiology research, including an annual training program retreat, and instruction in
the preparation of competitive proposals for funding, with a particular emphasis on applications for K and other
career development awards, including foundation awards. The specific aims are as follows:
1. To acquire sufficient training in basic laboratory or translational techniques and approaches to conduct
effective cutting-edge research into relevant infectious disease problems;
2. To foster the creation of impactful scientific contributions by means of strong and longitudinal
mentorship by program faculty; and
3. To develop a primary research focus and a broad understanding of infectious diseases and

10942272,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biomedical research data sets are increasingly being deposited in public, centralized databases, such as the
Sequence Read Archive (SRA), to which researchers submit sequencing-based data. Large centralized
databases greatly enable opportunities for training powerful machine learning models, as well as for reanalysis
and cross-study meta-analysis of biomedical data. These analyses can be used to answer questions that were
not addressed in the papers first describing the data, including those that could only be answered by
aggregating data from multiple studies. Unfortunately, researchers have not been able to fully capitalize on
databases of biomedical data sets largely because the metadata provided for data sets are often unstructured,
unstandardized, and incomplete. For example, the primary metadata for samples with assays deposited in the
SRA are provided as a list of key-value pairs, with no standardization of the keys or values and no required
fields. Such poor metadata pose challenges for integrating datasets with these databases as well as for
querying for specific data sets of interest.
To fully enable the opportunities offered by large biomedical databases, we propose to develop automated
methods for curating the metadata contained within them. These methods will standardize the metadata of a
database by assigning to each record a set of standardized terms for concepts represented within biomedical
ontologies and will additionally identify the relationship between each concept and record (e.g., a record’s
corresponding biological sample was derived from liver tissue). A complementary set of methods will be
developed to identify missing or unstandardized concepts in metadata. The developed methods will use
machine learning approaches that can be trained with minimal human effort. To achieve high accuracy with
sparse training data, we will take advantage of cutting-edge approaches in deep learning, natural language
processing, and active learning. As a specific application of these general methods, we will use them to
standardize and enhance the metadata contained within the SRA and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
for the most commonly assayed species using a comprehensive set of ontology concepts and relationships.
The resulting standardized metadata for the SRA and GEO will be made freely available and easily accessible
via a web interface, bulk downloads, and R and Python interface packages. The developed methods, along
with the standardized metadata they produce, will allow biomedical databases to be used to their full potential
in advancing our understanding of fundamental biology and human health."

Urinary urgency, with or without incontinence, greatly affects the quality of life in individuals suffering from
Overactive Bladder (OAB). A sudden and often overwhelming desire to pass urine occurs frequently (8 times
and more) throughout the day, often coinciding with nocturia. More prevalent in females, the overall prevalence
in U.S. studies is 14%. Lifestyle modifications, bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercise and antimuscarinic OAB
therapies are initial treatments for OAB. Although these can provide some relief, complete relief is rare, and
treatment is entirely unsuccessful in 25-40% of women (refractory OAB) due to lack of initial effect, developed
tolerance, or intolerable side effects leading to discontinuation.
Both implantable and non-invasive posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) devices have been FDA approved
to treat refractory OAB. These existing PTNS devices are placed many millimeters or even centimeters from the
nerve, and have significant issues with inconsistent targeting/migration, with stimulation induced side-effects
putatively limiting engagement with intended A-beta sensory fibers within the tibial nerve. Implantable PTNS
devices are also costly and complex, leading to significant device related complications. To address these
issues, we will use a rational engineering approach to develop, validate and optimize a novel minimally invasive
electrode strategy consisting of only 2 implanted passive materials, and an associated surgical tool that allows
for direct targeting of the nerve via injection. We anticipate this will yield dramatically improved nerve engagement
while reducing complications."
10942419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."
11041974,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for the development of cervical cancer. Worldwide, infection with HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases. Cervical cancer could be nearly eliminated as a public health problem if prophylactic HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening with effective diagnostic follow up and treatment of cervical precancers were deployed globally. Yet, less than 10% of young girls receive HPV vaccination and similarly low proportion of women receive cervical cancer screening globally. Consequently, cervical cancer burden is expected to increase over the coming century despite the 2018 WHO call for cervical cancer elimination as a public health problem. NCI continues to push forward cervical cancer prevention research on both HPV vaccination and screening.
PRISMA
PRISMA is a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 5000 women aged 18-30 years to quantitate the reduction in incident cervical HPV16/18 persistent infections afforded by a single dose of the bivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines compared to no vaccination, the default standard in the majority of the world for women over the age of 14 years.
In FY23, the window for the first 12-month follow-up visit opened, study forms and manuals were updated, and staff were trained in the follow-up procedures. 
EXTEND2.0: 
The Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial (CVT) was a community-based, pre-licensure, randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the VLP-based, bivalent HPV vaccine. One of the more unexpected and novel discoveries showed that, in a post-hoc analysis, protection over four years against HPV16/18 infections among women initially uninfected with these types was uniformly high for recipients of one, two, or three doses after four years of follow-up in the blinded phase of the CVT. Among women who received a single dose, HPV16 and HPV18 antibody titers (assessed by ELISA) were substantially higher than those among unvaccinated women previously exposed to HPV16/18; titers remained stably elevated from 6-to-48 months post-vaccination, albeit at lower levels than for two or three doses. We initially extended CVT to 7 and 9 years; and further extended the effort for two additional visits from 991 women at years 14 and 16 (EXTEND). The current study, EXTEND2.0, is for two more visits from 693 women at years 18 and 20.  We aim to describe, by dose, the long-term positivity and stability of the antibody response to HPV vaccination. 
In FY23, the window for the 18-year follow-up visit opened. Nearly 60% of the eligible women attended the visit with high compliance with blood collection (100%)."

Project 4 – The Health Impact of Administrative Burdens for People with ADRD
The lives of people living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are challenging on multiple dimensions
that are made further complicated by healthcare-imposed administrative burdens. People with ADRD struggle
with both complex and simple memory and cognitive tasks that dominate their daily lives, often relying on
overburdened family caregivers. ADRD also face many other, less-obvious challenges related to their health and
well-being, including suffering from a variety of comorbidities, receiving lower quality care when accessing
services to treat these conditions, and high levels of reliance on caregivers for navigating the complexities of the
healthcare system. Further, doctors report challenges treating people with ADRD, including those related to
working with the patient (due to time and communication constraints), those related to billing for services provided
to people with ADRD, and helping them access specialist and social services. These challenges have the
potential to make people with ADRD uniquely impacted by the administrative burdens and hassles imposed by
the U.S. healthcare system. These hassles are pervasive. Patients and healthcare providers encounter these
burdens nearly every time they interact with the system. They come in the form of billing hassles, prior
authorization restrictions, complex applications for public insurance programs, and frequent eligibility
redeterminations for the same programs. Prior work has documented that these burdens and hassles impose
large financial, psychological, and time costs on patients and providers, but they may also affect patient health
and well-being. Hassles associated with accessing care may make providers less willing to treat patients whose
insurers are the most difficult to work with. Hassles associated with enrolling in and remaining enrolled in public
insurance programs may result in incomplete take-up of these programs and high levels of churn in and out of
coverage, possibly causing patients to forgo needed care. In this project, we will study the effects of these
hassles on access to healthcare and health outcomes for people with ADRD. First, we will document the
exposure of people with ADRD to these types of administrative burdens and compare them to those faced by
other patients. Second, we will study burdens in accessing care, focusing on billing hassles and prior
authorization restrictions. Third, we will study burdens in accessing Medicaid (especially long-term services and
supports benefits). Administrative hassles represent another key influence on healthcare delivery, access, and
disparities for people with ADRD and their families, complementing the study of innovative tools, race and
ethnicity, pressured environments, and policy incentives in the other P01 projects."

The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences
schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community
partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and
translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New
York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%)
parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years.
A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform
innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation.
We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health
disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has
catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable
growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into
a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region,
opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the
Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in
2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a
new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational
research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even
further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting
and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational
research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health
informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative
translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium;
2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special
populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes
focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical
informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform
research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand
translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively
contribute to the national consortium.

10942914,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Lymphedema is a debilitating, life-long iatrogenic sequalae of cancer treatment which is becoming an
important survivorship issue due to improved cancer survival. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a
highly aggressive form of breast cancer, require systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy for
oncological control. These treatments place them at the highest risk of developing lymphedema, with
approximately 50% developing it within 12 months following surgery. Therefore, developing strategies to
predict and prevent treat lymphedema would significantly impact the well-being of patients with IBC.
General strategies for treating lymphedema include physical therapy and the continuous use of compression
garments, and surgical treatments have recently been introduced that can provide some improvement in the
swelling and symptom burden. Given the incomplete outcomes of these interventions, especially for a high-risk
group like IBC patients, focus has recently shifted to risk-reducing surgeries. Immediate lymphatic
reconstruction (ILR) of lymphatic vessels at the time of axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) has resulted in
significantly lower rates of lymphedema among breast cancer patients for patients who received ILR.
Unfortunately, none of the studies on ILR have focused on IBC patients, or have investigated longitudinal
outcome measures, which would enable comprehensive outcome assessment, including identification of
potential biomarkers. We propose a single-arm, clinical trial investigating the impact of ILR on the development
of lymphedema in IBC patients at a single, high-volume center specializing in treatment of IBC patients.
We hypothesize that ILR in patients with IBC is preventative against lymphedema development as defined by
objective clinical threshold measurements, and prevents changes in lymphatic architecture and pumping
characteristic of lymphedema visualized using near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging (NIRFLI), as well
as functional alterations in peripheral blood immune cells associated with lymphedema development.
This hypothesis will be addressed in the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the incidence of clinical
lymphedema in IBC patients following ILR; (2) to establish a longitudinal, dynamic, imaging-based profile of
IBC patients following ILR using NIRF-LI to provide real-time visualization and objective characterization of
changes in lymphatic vessel architecture and function; and (3) to identify a blood-based, inflammation-related
signature of lymphedema in patients with IBC through longitudinal analysis of serum samples from our clinical
trial cohort, using an inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine array.
The proposed trial will allow objective assessment of lymphatic vessel anatomy and functional changes in
lymphedema, as well as to define immune characteristics that correlate with lymphedema development. If
successful, this work would provide impetus to change the surgical standard-of-care for patients with IBC and
help direct highest risk patients to specialized treatment centers for surgical intervention."
10940468,"Cytosine DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark present in many eukaryotes. The mammalian genome
undergoes tightly regulated global demethylation early development where faithfully inherited DNA methylations
are essential. In adult soma, while DNA methylation is largely stable, its aberrations have been widely observed
in aged and malignant tissues. Under these conditions, broad hypomethylated domains have been observed at
gene deserts and genomic repeats, a phenomenon linked to excessive proliferations. In the meantime, focal
hypermethylation occurs at lineage specific promoters, accompanied by widespread methylation variations at
conserved regulatory loci. The molecular basis and functional consequences for these DNA methylation
abnormality in adult tissues remain poorly understood.
In the current study, we investigate the role of DNA methylation in determining adult stem cell fates under
homeostasis and upon stress. In particular, we focus on the regulation of retrotransposons (RTs) by DNA
methylation and how their impact adult stem cell function. Differing from tandem repeats in the centromere and
telomere that are constitutively heterochromatin, RTs are interspersed genomic repeats that exist in both
heterochromatin and euchromatin state. Compared to protein-coding genes comprising 1.5% of the genome,
RTs constitute 40% of the genome and exert many regulatory functions, but are understudied due to their
sequence repetitiveness and less conserved nature. During pre-implantation, RTs residing in the
heterochromatin are transiently derepressed due to global demethylation and play an essential role in embryonic
development. In adult somatic tissues, RTs are largely suppressed but become aberrantly induced when
heterochromatin is destabilized, such as during aging and cancer. What pathways control RT levels in adult
tissues, their impact on lineage gene expressions, and their physiological role under homeostasis and upon
stress remain unclear.
To address these questions, we use mouse skin as our model that harbors well-characterized, highly accessible,
and genetically amenable adult stem cells. Epidermal and hair follicle stem cells in the skin fuel the homeostatic
postnatal remodeling, drive wound induced regeneration, and undergo functional decline during aging. By using
genetic models lacking what we have found to be a crucial epigenetic repressor of RTs in adult skin, we examine
(1) the molecular basis for DNA and histone methylation mediated RT silencing, and (2) the mechanism by which
DNA methylation and RT dynamics regulate adult stem cell fate decision in a physiological setting. We
hypothesize that DNA methylation at RTs could either locally impact neighbor gene expressions or titrate rate
limiting methylation machinery to regulate lineage gene levels at a distance, both of which contributing to adult
stem cell fate decisions. Our study will provide insights into the molecular interconnection between euchromatin
and heterochromatin in the context of adult stem cell fate decisions and tissue fitness."
10928522,"Kidney transplantation is the optimal therapy for end stage kidney disease (ESKD) but current transplant
outcomes are suboptimal, particularly for recipients of organs obtained from deceased donors (DD). Ischemia
Reperfusion Injury (IRI), which occurs in essentially all recipients following DD kidney transplantation,
contributes to poorer outcomes in DD transplant recipients. Preclinical studies implicate activation of the
complement system through the mannan binding lectin (MBL) pathway as one crucial driver of post-transplant
IRI and its downstream effects on allograft function. Additional preclinical work showed that blockade of MBL
complement activation using peri-transplant administration of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) can promote
recovery of allograft function following ischemia-reperfusion-(IR)-induced acute kidney injury. Our research
group performed two single center randomized controlled pilot trials of C1INH therapy to limit the downstream
consequences of IRI in human kidney transplant recipients. The results of these pilot trials support the novel
hypothesis that complement system inhibition with pre-implantation injection of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH)
into the donor organ renal artery alters the reparative process induced by IR following DD kidney
transplantation and improves allograft function at 1 year. We propose to determine the effects of pre-
implantation, intrarenal artery injection of C1INH on kidney transplant outcomes through a randomized
controlled, double blind, multicenter trial (aim 1). We will follow subjects for 12-months post-transplant to
assess the primary endpoint of eGFR. Secondary endpoints will be biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR)
efficacy failure (composite of BPAR, graft loss, death, and loss to follow up), and the 12-month abbreviated
iBOX score. Multiple exploratory endpoints include DGF incidence/severity. All subjects will be followed for 3
years to assess the impact of the intervention on long term outcomes. Associated mechanistic studies (aim 2)
using biopsy tissue and peripheral blood samples will provide insight into detected endpoint differences
between study arms, if observed, and if no differences are detected, will determine why the intervention was
ineffective. Approaches will include spatial transcriptomics, functional immune assays, and studies of graft-
derived exosomes, all performed using state-of-the-art techniques. The work will be completed over 7 years,
with the ability to deliver the primary endpoint clinical results within 4-5 years. The additional time permits
extended follow-up and mechanistic analyses. This proposed work addresses a key unmet need in kidney
transplantation, employs a unique therapeutic strategy, and will be performed by an experienced team. We
contend that if the study is successful in improving posttransplant outcomes, it could transform the field."
10934439,"The Nebraska Center for the Prevention of Obesity Diseases through Dietary Molecules (NPOD) leveraged
NIGMS Renovations and Alteration funds ($300,000) and institutional support to develop a new Research Core
(Biomedical and Obesity Research Core, BORC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in Phase 1.
NPOD's unique niche in obesity research is the study of bioactive food compounds that prevent, treat, and cure
obesity and co-morbidities. BORC is a critical resource to enable this work in Nebraska and has expanded
considerably over the Center's first nine years. In Phases 1 and 2, NPOD leadership negotiated $470,092
renovation funds and 3,353 square feet in space and acquired equipment worth $3,311,369 through UNL
commitments, equipment donations, and four administrative supplements (equipment) from NIGMS. BORC is
now comprised of the Obesity and Nutrition Laboratory, Small Animal Research Laboratory, and Microbiome
Suite. Together, these provide access to equipment unique to core research facilities located in Nebraska and
support services that include consultation on experimental design, data acquisition, large data processing, and
biostatistical analysis. BORC works with NPOD's Administrative Core to coordinate services provided by NPOD's
biostatisticians and is networked to the Holland Computer Center, UNL's supercomputing facility. BORC has 94
accounts (principal investigators), representing 256 users (12 external), and numbers of samples analyzed and
service requests received have more than doubled from the end of Phase 1 (2019) to the end of Year 9 in Phase
2. BORC has analyzed a cumulative 151,163 samples through an annual average of 1,400 service requests
since 2014. BORC has generated $1,228,197 in service fees since it started charging fees in June 2017 and
has generated an average annual revenue of $266,335 since becoming a UNL-approved fee-for-service center
in June 2019. Users have expressed their satisfaction with the service through surveys, and UNL has recognized
the importance of BORC for biomedical research in Nebraska, committing $200,000 and 507 square feet of new
space to BORC in Phase 3, as well as $294,628 toward the director's salary and equipment upgrades in the
subsequent three years. BORC is on a strong trajectory for sustainability after Phase 3: BORC user fees
($266,335) cover 84% of BORC operating expenses, and any shortfall can be covered by F&A costs returned to
the Center ($173,444 in FY2022). This positions BORC for continued institutional support, as evaluated by
reasonable benchmarks such as decreasing subsidy rates to under 10% and supporting 50% of expenditures
through user fees. In Phase 3, the goal is to position BORC for sustainability and growth after end of NIGMs
funding relative to current levels. NPOD and BORC will seek to meet this goal through the following Specific
Aims. Specific Aim 1. Retain existing and recruit new users through acquiring state-of-the-art instrumentation.
Specific Aim 2. Retain existing and recruit new users through providing expert services by highly qualified
personnel. Specific Aim 3. Meet institutional benchmarks to qualify for long-term institutional support."
10931149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria are enveloped in sugary layers that maintain cell shape, protect against osmotic pressure, and resist
environmental hazards. In Gram-negative bacteria, the cell envelope surrounds the cytoplasm and includes a
cytoplasmic (inner) membrane, a thin peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, and an outer membrane. The cell envelope
is essential and is therefore a prominent target for antibacterials and vaccines. However, bacteria continue to
develop new ways to evade these life-saving compounds. Thus, it is imperative that we understand the
mechanisms of cell envelope assembly, ultimately to design new modes of interference. One poorly understood
aspect of assembly revolves around the essential lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P). Bacterial
surface glycans, including PG and other clinically important polysaccharides, are assembled on and transported
across the cytoplasmic membrane by Und-P. While decreasing the pool of Und-P induces cells to grow poorly
and die, little to no effort has been applied to understand what effects occur when the pool of Und-P increases.
Therefore, we will manipulate pathways that create Und-P to determine how maximizing the pool of Und-P affects
Und-P-dependent processes. Similarly, pathways compete for a common pool of Und-P, but no one knows how
this is done. Since such information is fundamental to disrupting the relationships among Und-P-utilizing
pathways, we will manipulate pathways that use Und-P. Another poorly understood aspect of Und-P metabolism
surrounds its utilization. Und-P inhibitors disrupt Und-P-dependent polymer formation, but how cells prioritize
pathways when Und-P becomes limiting is not known. To that end, we will characterize Und-P pathways
(including a potential new pathway) in Escherichia coli cells disrupted for Und-P metabolism. Finally, we will
continue to pursue results from a genetic screen in a mutant defective for Und-P recycling, which has uncovered
new and unexpected connections to Und-P metabolism that we propose to characterize in detail. In summary,
results from this study will enable us to understand, in greater detail, the mysteries surrounding Und-P utilization
and cell envelope assembly. At the same time, the tools and knowledge developed in the course of this work
promise to provide signal benefits for those working on the design of antimicrobial therapies."
10935386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Overall
Racial and ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) are particularly pronounced in African American and
Alaska Native people. These differences cannot be explained by access to screening and health care alone,
suggesting underlying yet understudied contributors to disease etiology, progression, and response to treatment.
Ongoing innovations in biotechnology that enable detailed evaluations of the underpinnings of tumor and host
molecular genetics and genomic biology have been inadequately leveraged to address these disparities.
Collectively, our outstanding transdisciplinary team has the expertise to use cutting-edge technologies to drive
innovative translational cancer disparities research directly focused on developing novel prevention, early
detection, diagnosis, and treatment approaches. To achieve our overarching goal of reducing persistent CRC
disparities, particularly those present among Alaska Native and African American people, we propose the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Improve risk stratified screening and early detection of CRC across racial
and ethnic populations by developing risk prediction models that perform equally well across racial and ethnic
groups. Aim 2: Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in CRC-specific mortality by discovering and validating
novel molecular and biological changes related to risk of lethal CRC and response to treatment in racially and
ethnically diverse patients that can guide surveillance and treatment selection for CRC survivors. Aim 3:
Discover novel therapeutic targets for CRC across racially and ethnically diverse populations and test
potential clinical interventions aimed at reducing CRC disparities by advancing our understanding of
differences and similarities in the genetic, molecular, and microbial characteristics of CRC in diverse populations
and testing the effectiveness of novel interventions in clinical trials that enroll diverse CRC patients. Our world-
class investigator team has expertise in basic science, clinical and translational research, minority health, and
cancer disparities. During the P20 SPORE planning phase we have brought together a large biorepository of
various biospecimen types and detailed clinical data from a large, racially and ethnically diverse CRC patient
population with equal numbers of African American, Alaska Native, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White patients,
and through our long-term leadership in genetic epidemiology we have access to the world's largest and most
racially and ethnically diverse CRC germline genetic data set. Utilizing these unique resources, our program will
conduct four translational projects supported by three essential cores that will provide centralized expertise in:
a) leadership and administration, b) biospecimens, pathology and molecular technologies, and c) biostatistics
and bioinformatics. Our Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs will ensure that we recruit
talented and diverse investigators and develop a pipeline of novel translational cancer disparities research
projects. Through this integrated effort we envision realizing our goal of a sustained translational research
program focused on eliminating CRC disparities and more broadly reducing CRC-related morbidity and mortality."

10935607,"Project Summary
The objective of the Glioma SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to identify innovative pilot
research projects in glioma that have translational potential. The DRP utilizes a solicitation and review process
to select meritorious pilot projects for funding. The solicitation process capitalizes on an established, extensive
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) communications infrastructure to widely disseminate an annual
Request for Proposals (RFP). The review process utilizes an experienced panel of DF/HCC glioma scientists.
The DRP provides limited-duration funding for innovative projects that have ultimate translational potential and
could synergize with existing SPORE projects and cores. DF/HCC institutions match DRP funding from this
SPORE to expand the pool of DRP awardees. The DRP applications are judged for their potential as pilot or
collaborative studies that will generate feasibility data and for potential to emerge as full projects in future years
of the SPORE program. The DRP employs a monitoring process to measure progress and outcomes of DRP
projects with clearly established metrics and oversight by the DRP Awards Committee. DRP awardees are
required to present progress reports at the annual SPORE retreat attended by all SPORE Internal and External
Advisory Boards."
10936125,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 10-34 year-olds. Aligning with the NIMH’s Prioritized
Agenda for Suicide Prevention Research, this K23 career development award seeks to advance what is known
about the brain/behavior mechanisms underlying self-critical rumination ─ defined as persistent negative-self-
evaluation ─ and self-reassurance ─ providing compassion to self. This K23’s central hypothesis is that
circuit alterations in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate, and insula
underlying self-critical rumination and self-reassurance are associated with increased suicidal thoughts and
behavior (STB) in adolescents. Our central methodology is to examine self-critical rumination and self-
reassurance using task-dependent and task-independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in 90 12-15-year-old youth recruited on the range of STB. This age
group represents a critical developmental period for these self-referential processes, and youth in this age
group experienced an alarming increase in suicide rates over the last decade. This K23’s research goals are
to: (i) test the associations between in vivo self-critical rumination, self-reassurance, and STB; (ii) identify
neural mechanisms underlying self-critical rumination and self-reassurance; (iii) integrate the findings from the
scanner with STB assessed in adolescents’ real-world environment. This K23’s career development goals
are to gain hands-on mentorship with (i) task-dependent and task-independent fMRI to assess circuit function,
(ii) EMA for better real-world assessment of self-critical rumination and self-reassurance, (iii) statistical
approaches for imaging and EMA data, (iv) professional development and collaboration skills. This K23 is
significant because identifying specific neural mechanisms underlying the interplay between self-critical
rumination, self-reassurance, and STB can help ascertain which teens are at a greater risk for STB and
contribute to developing novel, mechanistically informed interventions. This study, combined with the
completion of proposed training goals, will effectively propel the candidate towards establishing an
independent program of research focused on identifying bio-behavioral mechanisms and developing
preventative interventions for youth suicide risk. This K23 is innovative because this will be the first project to
identify specific neural mechanisms of self-critical rumination and self-reassurance in adolescents, focusing on
(i) identifying construct-specific neural mechanisms, (ii) a trans-diagnostic sample of teenagers selected on the
range of STB, (iii) integration of imaging and EMA techniques. The mentors (Drs. Spirito, Armey, Jones, and
Brick) and consultants (Drs. Price and Maratos) have extensive experience to support the proposed training
goals. The Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University is an outstanding environment
for the proposed training and research."
10940266,"Abstract
Humans are subjected daily to multiple and often simultaneous environmental stressors, yet the complex
interaction of these agents remains an understudied area. Of significance, the exposure to environmental
ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has profound effects on the skin and induces systemic consequences from vitamin D
production to immunosuppression to melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Besides, ubiquitous
environmental pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) exert immunomodulatory as well as pro-
carcinogenic effects. However, there is a significant knowledge gap of interactions between UVR and pollutants,
including the mechanisms of their combined effects leading to disease pathophysiology such as skin cancer.
Recent studies, including ours, have indicated that small membrane-bound vesicles known as microvesicle
particles (MVP) released from cells in response to various stressors can act as potent signaling agents due to
their ability to carry nuclear and cytoplasmic components. We have demonstrated that UVB, due to its ability to
generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), produces high levels of the lipid mediator Platelet-activating factor
(PAF) agonists and MVP from epithelial cells and skin. Notably, recent studies using PAFR-expressing/null cell
lines and pharmacologic/genetic inhibition of ROS, and the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) have
implicated the involvement of the PAF-receptor (PAFR) signaling in aSMase activation resulting in UVB-
generated MVP (UVB-MVP) release. These UVB-MVP carry bioactive PAF agonists, and mediate UVB-induced
delayed immunosuppressive effects. Importantly, we discovered that the PAH Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) interaction
with UVB releases high levels of UVB-MVP and generates increased levels of PAF agonists. As other ROS-
generating PAH compounds such as anthracene, chrysene, and pyrene are natural components of
environmental pollutants and associated with disease pathophysiologies, including lung/skin cancer mortality,
we propose one specific aim to test the hypothesis that these PAHs will exert synergistic effects with UVB in the
generation of ROS, PAF-agonists, and MVPs involving the PAFR and acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase)
pathways. Aim 1 will use in vitro cell lines and pharmacologic inhibitors to determine the role and mechanisms
of these PAHs and UVB in the generation of ROS, PAF, and MVP. Successful completion of this project will (i)
define a novel mechanism by which a PAH pollutant can augment UVR-induced effects; and ii) address an
important question in photobiology as to how a keratinocyte-specific stimulus can generate systemic signaling
effects. Importantly, this supplement project will provide mentorship, required skills and knowledge to a talented
applicant and assist her transition to an independent health care research career path in the future."
10940521,"Project Summary [Parent project]
 In this Industry-Academic Partnership R01 application, a multidisciplinary team of investigators from the
University of California at Davis, TargaGenix and Northeastern University are proposing to develop a highly
innovative combination treatment strategy for refractory tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA). The proposed studies will leverage multi-disciplinary expertise of scientists and clinicians to develop
effective PDA treatment paradigm based on the combination of TGX-1214 (a nanoemulsion of our lead next
generation taxoid DHA-SBT-1214) with immune checkpoint inhibition. In preliminary studies, our novel lead
agent DHA-SBT-1214 strongly inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in two preclinical models of pancreatic cancer
(complete tumor regression in both models). In addition, we have recently documented that the combination of
an anti-PD-L1 therapy with our novel chemotherapy drug DHA-SBT-1214 formulated in a nanoemulsion (TGX-
1214), significantly increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and enhanced the therapeutic effects of the anti-PD-L1
antibody in a pancreatic cancer syngeneic model. It is noteworthy that TGX-1214 alone on combined with an
anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy strongly reduced tumor growth to a higher extent than paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel
(Abraxane), gemcitabine, or single anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy groups. Moreover, in the clinically relevant KPC
genetically-engineered mouse model of PDA, TGX-1214 reduced tumor fibrosis and increased of CD8+ T-cell
infiltration. Importantly, TGX-1214 appears safe and present a high therapeutic window as indicated by GLP-
toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Thus, these results indicate that TGX-1214 is safe and effective in multiple
preclinical models of PDA; it stimulates the immunogenic potential of PDA and provides synergistic therapeutic
effects with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, warranting further evaluation. Our long-term goal is to develop
safe and effective treatment strategies for PDA to test in clinical trials and ultimately to be used in humans. Based
on these novel findings, we hypothesize that a combination of TGX-1214 and immune checkpoint antibody
therapy will provide superior efficacy with less toxicity. The specific aims of the study are: (1): To evaluate tumor-
specific delivery, biodistribution, tumor stromal density modulation, and immune cell infiltration of TGX-1214 in
clinically relevant animal models of PDA; (2): To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the TGX-1214
along with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy in two clinically relevant PDA animal models (orthotopically grafted
pancreatic tumor organoids and KPC mice), and (3): To determine the efficacy of TGX-1214 as monotherapy in
patients with treatment-refractory PDA. At the completion of these studies, we expect that TGX-1214 in
combination with cancer immunotherapy, will become part of the personalized medicine revolution that is only
now beginning and will become a significant part of the future treatment paradigms to eliminate the burden of
PDA, providing positive benefits in long-term treatment outcomes."
10942720,"Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, which includes spinal pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia, is a common
and costly problem for older adults and is associated with decreased quality of life. There is a clear need for
interventions that increase one’s ability to cope with chronic pain and engage in meaningful life activities even
with the presence of chronic pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychotherapy that uses
mindfulness and psychological acceptance to support individuals in working toward behavioral goals guided by
their personal values, even in the presence of undesirable experiences such as chronic pain. Clinical practice
guidelines recommend the use of ACT for treating chronic pain based on evidence of effectiveness from
multiple RCTs. However, uptake and reach are limited because there are insufficient numbers of mental health
professionals who currently offer ACT or other recommended therapies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) for
chronic pain. In addition, many older adults are not willing or able to engage in traditional psychotherapy for
chronic pain even when it is available. Although some bibliotherapy and digital health interventions (e.g., apps)
have been developed for treating pain, many older adults fail to use them due to low levels of comfort with
technology or lack of motivation for intensive self-guided approaches. Narrative communication is an
alternative way to deliver behavior change principles that involves “storytelling” involving real patients talking
about their struggles and recovery progress. Therapeutic narratives delivered via videos may be more
engaging and immersive than traditional self-help formats for older adults. In previous grant-funded research,
our team has developed methods for creating narrative, video-based interventions designed to reduce
depression in primary care patients and prevent suicide in patients following a psychiatric hospital. Thus, in this
project, we propose to create Reclaim Your Day (RYD), which will consist of 6, 30-min weekly video episodes
highlighting patients’ inspiring and illustrative experiences living with chronic pain in order to teach current
patients with chronic MSK pain how to apply ACT’s evidence-based strategies. In Phase 1 of this project, we
will interview older adults with chronic MSK pain about their coping history, and code interviews for consistency
with ACT principles. We will invite a subset of these individuals to work with a professional storytelling coach to

of RYD. In Phase 2, we will conduct a pilot RCT (n=100) of older adults with chronic MSK pain. All participants
will receive a 30-min introductory pain education video. Participants will be randomized to receive either RYD
or a comparison intervention (health education videos). We will examine RYD feasibility and acceptability as
well as changes over time in outcomes (pain interference, depression, quality of life) and putative mediators."
10946705,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric disorders represent a leading cause of disability, affecting nearly 19% of the US population.
Only 9% of neuropsychiatric drugs entering clinical trials reach the market, which is one of the lowest success
rates across all therapeutic areas. Fundamental differences between the neurobiology of rodents and humans
have been proposed to account for translational failures in development of effective therapeutic strategies to
mitigate neurological or neurodegenerative diseases or disorders. Rodent behavioral assays are also variably
effective in predicting clinically effective neuropsychiatric drugs. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are recognized as
a valuable, clinically relevant alternative to span the gap between rodents and humans in the development of
therapies designed to advance brain health. Among NHPs, the common marmoset or Callithrix jacchus (cj)
affords a highly tractable option because of its small size, short lifespan, production of multiple offspring/year
and accurate recapitulation of human neuroanatomy. However, the ultimate utility of the marmoset model
remains in its infancy due to the paucity of efficient tools to facilitate studies requiring genetic modification,
especially those needed to recapitulate complex aspects of brain health. To address this urgent need, we will
combine close proximity to one of two NIH-designated Marmoset Breeding Colonies (U24 MH123422, funded
under RFA-MH-20-145) maintained at the Southwest National Primate Research Center and leading expertise
in brain health and disease in general and the neurogenetics of epilepsy in particular. In this diversity supplement,
we will perform the experiments outlined in Aim 3 of the parent U01 application, which is to assess the impact of
ARX mutations on marmoset cortical neuron development and migration. This aim is designed to advance the
utility of the marmoset model for brain research based on the development of PSC-derived brain organoids and
specific knowledge of the neurological impact of ARX mutations."
10946710,"Background: Despite increasing evidence of the health impact of exposure to traumatic stress during wartime
for veterans, less is known about gender differences in long-term health risks, including risks for chronic
disease and early mortality. Given that veteran status can be an important influence on later health, it is
important to advance understanding of what are likely to be gender-specific effects, as much of what is
currently known about veterans’ long-term health is based on male veteran samples. To better tailor clinical
services for veterans, more information is needed on gender differences in the implications of military service—
including the effects of warfare-related exposures, as well as experiences disproportionately facing deployed
women, such as military sexual trauma (MST), and their mental health sequelae—for long-term health
outcomes, especially chronic disease morbidity and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, including suicide.
Study Design: The proposed retrospective research will overcome existing gaps in the literature related to
representing older women veterans and examining long-term health risk by leveraging data from two national
cohorts of Vietnam Era (VNE) veterans: HealthViEWS (CSP 579; N=4,219), a study of VNE women veterans,
and the Veteran Health Study (CSP 569; N=5,598), a study of male VNE veterans. Leveraging and building
directly on these two VA CSP studies, the objective of this project is to examine gender differences in the
impact of military service, including warfare-related exposures and MST, and mental health sequelae—
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
and substance use disorder (SUD)—on later-life health outcomes, with a focus on cardiovascular disease
(CVD), cancer, and other chronic conditions and early mortality risk. Both CSP studies used a mail survey to
collect data on demographics, military experiences, health outcomes, and psychosocial factors, and a
telephone interview to diagnose psychiatric disorders. In addition to leveraging these important VA data, vital
status records on CSP participants will be obtained via the National Death Index (NDI). This study will also
account for salient military service characteristics and later-life psychosocial factors, such as health behaviors,
social support, and suicidal ideation. Gender comparisons in the weighted prevalence of health outcomes will
be conducted, and associations will be tested using regression-based models, including gender-stratified
structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine gender differences in risk for long-term health outcomes.
Clinical Implications: As the number of veterans age 65 and older accessing VA healthcare is expected to
rapidly increase over the next 10-20 years, it is crucial to advance understanding of aging veterans’ health and
clinical care needs in the context of their military experiences. In addition to directly targeting the VA Women’s
Health priority area, this project is responsive to CSR&D calls for research that advances understanding of
PTSD and commonly occurring co-morbidities (i.e., MDD and SUD), as well as suicide and diseases with a
high healthcare burden in the veteran population, such as CVD. This project’s focus on gender comparisons
represents a critical step forward in the understanding of the lasting effects of military service for veterans, as
the vast majority of studies on older veterans to date have focused on men, and gender comparisons of long-
term health risk and associated implications for clinical care have rarely been conducted. Yet women’s
experiences in the military are distinct from men’s experiences, and women veterans may have different
clinical care needs than their male counterparts. This project’s ultimate objective is to provide actionable
information that can be disseminated to VA clinical services to target the unique needs of aging female and
male veterans, while also informing preventive care to maximize long-term health for veterans across eras."
10943543,"The overarching goal of this application is to advance our understanding of the role of the Apical sodium-
dependent bile acid (BA) transporter (ASBT; also called IBAT) in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease
and associated kidney injury, and to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of action of systemically acting
ASBT inhibitors. In addition to ileal enterocytes, ASBT is expressed by kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells
to limit BA loss in urine. ASBT is also expressed by cholangiocytes in the liver, where ASBT can mediate
cholehepatic shunting of BAs. In contrast to ileum, much less is known regarding the ASBT’s role in those
tissue compartments in cholestatic liver disease or whether ASBT inhibition in kidney and biliary tract may
have therapeutic benefit or deleterious effects. BAs have been implicated in a disorder called Cholemic
Nephropathy (also called Bile Cast Nephropathy) and may be an underestimated contributor to kidney injury
in patients with liver disease. Guided by the applicant’s previously published work and strong preliminary data,
two specific aims are proposed to address those gaps. Specific Aim 1 is designed to elucidate the kidney
ASBT’s contribution to the hepatoprotective actions of systemic ASBT inhibition and define the role of kidney
ASBT in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease-associated kidney injury. This will be accomplished
using a novel kidney-specific ASBT knockout, state-of-the-art imaging approaches, and surgical and genetic
models of cholestasis, including models with a “humanized” BA pool (Cyp2c70 knockout mice). The time
course and extent of liver and kidney injury will be determined to elucidate the relationship of kidney ASBT
and urinary BA elimination to development of the hepatic and associated kidney injury. Human renal tubule
organoids will be used to interrogate molecular mechanisms by which BAs alone or in combination with other
liver-derived cholephiles induce renal proximal tubule cell toxicity. Specific Aim 2 is designed to define the
role of the biliary tract ASBT in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease and the hepatoprotective actions
of systemic ASBT inhibition. This will be accomplished using a novel liver-specific ASBT knockout mouse,
state-of-the-art imaging approaches, and surgical and genetic models of cholestasis, including models with a
“humanized” BA pool (Cyp2c70 knockout mice). The time course and extent of liver injury will be determined
to elucidate the relationship of cholangiocyte ASBT and cholehepatic BA shunting to development of
hepatobiliary disease. These innovative studies will yield novel and potentially paradigm-changing insights to
the contribution of kidney and biliary tract BA reabsorption to the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease
and the associated kidney injury (Cholemic Nephropathy). The findings are predicted to be impactful and will
guide development of new, safe, and effective approaches to treat the multi-organ damaged associated with
cholestasis."
10941783,"Project Summary
This proposal for the NIGMS R35 Early-Stage Investigator award seeks to support my laboratory’s overall
mission of determining multifunctional roles for proteins involved in animal development and human
health. This is important in genetic causes of disease, as a complete understanding of a protein’s cellular
functions is needed to design effective therapies. We combine the powerful genetic tools of Drosophila
melanogaster with high resolution imaging to determine secondary functions of development and disease
proteins. Our expertise in microcomputed tomography (μ-CT) is critical for these investigations, yet we have also
not harnessed the full potential of what this imaging technology can offer for model organism communities. This
proposal encompasses two complementary themes to address these gaps in knowledge. Theme 1 describes
our plans to use the Drosophila melanogaster protein Abnormal Spindle (Asp), who’s human ortholog (ASPM)
has been implicated in microcephaly, cancer, and infertility, as a model system to determine multifunctional
protein roles and their influence on stem cell function, tissue size, and tissue architecture. We will address three
questions over the next 5 years. (1) What are the secondary functions of clinically relevant proteins whose
genotype–phenotype relationship is unknown? We will investigate Asp as a regulator of the Notch signaling
pathway based on our preliminary data, which strongly suggests that Asp may be a novel component of this
critical cell fate determination pathway. (2) Are protein moonlighting functions cell type specific? Leveraging our
protein interaction data, we will explore Asp’s interaction with the mitotic protein Mushroom body defect (Mud)
in the brain and germline to determine if the cell biological mechanisms these proteins promote in each tissue
are dependent on their direct interaction. (3) How do alternative roles of proteins affect the ability of stem cells
to control tissue size and architecture? This will examine the role of mitotic timing in stem cells, which we found
to be disrupted in asp mutant animals, and how this influences the ability of stem cell populations in the brain
and gut to promote proper tissue growth and architecture. In Theme 2, we will use our expertise in μ-CT and
artificial intelligence (AI) to create modern, updated developmental atlases for the Drosophila melanogaster and
Xenopus laevis model organism communities. These virtual repositories and AI tools will be freely accessible,
allowing for in-depth investigations of the entire developmental time window in 2D and 3D. Both themes will be
bolstered by ongoing productive collaborations. Our overall vision is to provide key insights into the
multifunctional roles of a disease-relevant protein, while establishing the framework for future work to
build a μ-CT mutant image database to allow fly and frog researchers to identify new phenotypes for
their favorite genes. This will serve to accelerate the identification of secondary roles for other biomedically-
relevant proteins, toward a greater understanding of gene function and the genotype-phenotype relationship."

synchrotron center will be supported by both the National Institute of General Medical Sciences/National
Institutes of Health (NIGMS/NIH) and the Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental
Research (DOE BER).
The CBMS team will administer the Center to allow for safe, responsive use by the research community, we will
monitor use and develop the capabilities as appropriate to need. We will provide review-based access, training,
and technical assistance to assure success of research programs that use this remarkable set of synchrotron

To pursue our support mission, we plan to make the best use of NSLS-II capabilities by employing multiple
mature synchrotron technologies. We will support macromolecular crystallography (MX) at our micro-focusing
beamlines through on-site visits, automatic data collection processes, and remote beamline access. For X-ray
scattering we will support, static and online HPLC-backed small-angle scattering (SAXS). In addition, we will
continue to extend the impact of the scanning-beam method for SAXS tomography and to support the use of low-
energy x-ray scattering studies. We are now able to propose the addition of synchrotron x-ray footprinting (XF),
as a mature complementary technique, to the existing resources available within CBMS. We will continue to
develop all these tools, driven by the needs of the biological and environmental-science communities."
10946990,"Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) Technology Core - Abstract 
The Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) Core oversees operation of the two state-of-the-art NIH-funded MX 
beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II). The Highly Automated MX (AMX) beamline 
(17-ID-1), and the Frontier MX (FMX) beamline (17-ID-2) began user operation in January of 2017, and support 
projects at the forefront of bio-medical science that require regular access to the most advanced instrumentation 
and beam properties. At the same time, the beamlines and software enable routine experiments that are 
impossible elsewhere in the United States, and automated data-collection workflows for the higher throughput 
required for many NIH-funded projects tackling drug development. 
General user operation of AMX and FMX is funded by NIH and the Department of Energy (DOE) Biological and 
Environmental Research (BER); incremental improvements to existing capabilities and user driven 
experimental needs described in this proposed research are supported by the NIH while the DOE-BER 
companion grant funds development of new capabilities or upgrades. 
The ongoing Advanced Photon Source (APS) upgrade and the upcoming Advanced Light Source (ALS) upgrade 
shutdowns have a lasting impact on user demand for state-of-the-art capabilities already in high demand at 
NSLS-II but also for higher throughput and automation. 
Our ambitious plans to deliver user driven optimal resources described in this technological core are managed 
by a team with well-matched expertise. We provide access to world leading MX facilities and expertly train 
research groups to best use our resources. We ensure our resources are kept at the state of the art with regular 
updates, upgrades and when necessary, we develop new capabilities. Users access our two beamlines with the 
most advanced remote tools and our secure, high performance computing facilities for automated advanced data 
analysis, with aim to deliver beyond the status quo of data reduction; at completion of beamtime research groups 
access results from data analysis including structural models. 
To remain at the forefront of structural biology, our staff collaborates with international leading groups to 
implement and develop new technologies necessary to eventually optimize data collection and analysis from all 
possible samples. With experts in the field, we are exploring artificial intelligence, machine learning and large 
language models to further develop new technologies, when current methods and software demonstrate 
limitations. We are disseminating training materials and applications using standard processes."
10946991,"Abstract – X-ray Scattering Technology Core 
The X-ray Scattering Technology Core will provide user access to the Life Science X-ray Scattering (LiX) 
beamline. During the current funding period we have refined the scientific focus of the LiX beamline, 
concentrating on supporting solution scattering from biological macromolecules in solution and scanning 
imaging of biological tissues, while improving our technical capabilities in these two areas. The need to support 
mail-in measurements during the COVID pandemic required us to provide reliable automation for data 
collection and processing, which we have achieved. To accommodate the influx of users due to the Advanced 
Photon Source (APS) upgrade, we have redesigned our solution scattering sample handler to support 
measurement based on both flow cells and fixed cells, and to gain more usable beam time by minimizing the 
need to reconfigure the experimental setup. 
At the same time, under the Department of Energy (DOE) Biological and Environmental Research (BER) support 
parallel to this P30 grant, we have developed scanning structural mapping and tomographical imaging using 
scattering contrast. We also developed python software that enabled automation in data processing, and GUIs 
for data visualization. Under a BNL internal Laboratory Director’s Research and Development (LDRD) grant, we 
also explored integrative data analysis. These new capabilities will be rolled out to our users for routine use in 
the upcoming funding period. 
In this renewal, we will continue to provide reliable access to these capabilities and progressively improve the 
underlying technical tools and instrument usability. To support solution scattering, we will optimize data 
collection triggering, enhance the integration of the HPLC system into our data collection workflow, and adopt a 
co-flow device for in-line liquid chromatography measurements. To support scanning structural mapping, we 
will implement fly scans for in-vacuum measurements on thin tissue sections. In addition, we will work on 
providing more software tools to help users evaluate data quality and perform data processing and analysis. We 
will make these tools readily accessible via the centralized computing resources supported by the National 
Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II), and will provide training opportunities. We will continue to perform 
routine maintenance and implement new software tools to improve beam stability and to manage experimental 
configuration changes. We also plan to upgrade our scattering detectors to ensure uninterrupted operation of 
the beamline, and to install fluorescence detectors to enable simultaneous data collection for elemental mapping."
10941852,"Abstract/Summary
PAD is characterized by impaired blood flow to the lower extremities, causing claudication and exercise
intolerance. Up to now, assessment of PAD is mainly performed by determination of stenosis or occlusion in
the large arteries and does not focus on microcirculation. Impaired arteriolar endothelial function,
microvascular responsiveness to specific stimuli in patients with PAD may play a central role in disease
development and progression. The impaired microvascular reactivity can be assessed by hyperemic
response to contraction and cuff occlusion as well as in response to submaximal exercise. Therefore, imaging
microvascular flow reactivity at various scales using methods that are safe, noninvasive, reliably quantitative,
and low-cost through application of already widely available technology is critically important for early
diagnosis and management of PAD. Here, we propose a novel contrast-free ultrasound pressure-based
method equipped with novel quantitative metrics that involves estimation of blood flow signals in the calf
muscle through processing ultrasound data frames by means of coherent ensemble selection, clutter filtering
using singular value decomposition, and background noise equalization, followed by quantitative analysis of
the flow variations in response to external pressure and submaximal exercise. Our vision is to complement
US with additional quantitative information of microvascular flow imaging that is relevant to disease
progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a new noninvasive tool for early diagnosis of PAD. A
secondary gain from such an imaging method will be monitoring the disease progression and the response
to interventional treatment in PAD patients. The proposed contrast-free ultrasound-based technique is named
Angio Flow Reactivity Analysis (AFRA). An advantage of this technique is that it does not require the use of
contrast agents to produce high-resolution images of the microvasculature flow. The project includes 2
specific aims: Specific Aim 1- Determine the efficacy of the new contrast-free US-based method, AFRA, for
assessment of PAD in patient volunteers with symptoms of claudication or atypical leg syndrome and
correlate the results with ABI and CTA. Specific Aim #2- Determine the efficacy of the proposed contrast-free
US-based method, AFRA, for assessment of disease progression and monitoring the response to
interventional treatment in patients diagnosed with PAD and correlate and the results with ABI and CTA. This
proposal is the result of collaboration among several experts in the field and benefits from the world-class
clinical researchers and facilities at Mayo Clinic. The overall project aims to develop a new contrast-free
ultrasound tool for evaluating microvascular flow changes in the lower leg of patients at risk for PAD, a
disease that leads to common disabilities, amputation, and major cardiovascular events. Successful
completion of this research will open the door for a new technology for this group of patients in the clinic."
10942477,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning."

ducibility, cross-validation, and interpretation in parallel and/or complementary studies."
10942970,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the agent of Legionnaires’ disease. In water systems, Lp grows in amoebae
and biofilms, and in the lungs, it infects macrophages. CRISPR-Cas systems are a common feature of Lp,
where they expectedly confer immunity to invading genetic elements. Yet, through an analysis of Lp 130b,
which has the most common Lp CRISPR-Cas type (type II-B), we discovered that Cas2 majorly promotes Lp
infection of amoebae. Compatible with this, cas2 mRNA is hyperexpressed during Lp infection of amoebae and
during stationary phase, the growth stage linked to the infectious Lp phenotype. Critically, the infection role of
Cas2 was distinct from adaptive immunity, i.e., i) a cas2 mutant’s infection defect occurred in the absence of
any foreign genetic element, ii) mutants lacking other cas genes or the CRISPR array were not impaired, and
iii) introduction of Cas2 into a Lp strain that naturally lacks a CRISPR-Cas locus caused that strain to be more
infective for amoebae. We purified Lp Cas2 and showed that it has RNase activity, and by testing a mutant
form of Cas2 that lacked the ability to cleave ssRNAs, we showed that RNase activity is critical for the ability of
Cas2 to promote infection of amoebae. This work has endured as the sole example of Cas2 clearly promoting
a non-canonical or infectious phenotype. Thus, we posited that Cas2, by virtue of its ability to cleave/degrade
RNA, influences the amount or configuration of an mRNA that encodes or regulates a key infectivity factor. We
now identify expression of a previously undefined small heat shock protein gene (hspC2) as being increased
by the presence of Cas2. Mutant analysis found that HspC2, along with Cas2, promotes Lp growth in amoebae
and macrophages as well as biofilm formation, thereby revealing a role for a sHsp in pathogenesis and new
insight into how Cas2 impacts Lp infectivity. We also confirmed a role for Cas2 in Lp thermal tolerance and
biofilm formation. Given these data, we propose that the Lp Cas2-HspC2 axis can be a new model or paradigm
for decoding how Cas proteins non-canonically impact gene expression, thermal tolerance, and virulence.
Thus, we now aim to discern whether Cas2 i) acts directly by binding and then cleaving/degrading (only) a part
of hspC2 mRNA such that the transcript is more stable, ii) acts indirectly by binding and degrading wholesale
the RNA for a repressor of hspC2 transcription, or iii) again acts indirectly but by binding and then cleaving a
part of the mRNA for a transcriptional activator of hspC2 such that the resulting RNA is more stable. This
proposal has the potential to i) advance our understanding of Lp physiology and virulence, potentially revealing
new targets for restricting Lp spread, ii) define a new mode of bacterial gene regulation controlled by multi-
purpose Cas2 proteins, and iii) ultimately uncover a form of nuclease activity that might have broad application."
10942972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A group of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), are characterized by the presence within brain neurons of inclusions comprised of
hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. Tau is normally a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that
appears to provide stability to MTs in axons, and excessive phosphorylation of tau in tauopathies
promotes its disengagement from MTs and misfolding into oligomeric and fibrillar structures. This
results in increased MT dynamicity, reduced MT density and altered axonal transport in transgenic (Tg)
mouse tauopathy models, with evidence of similar MT deficits in AD brain that likely contribute to
neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that administration of the brain-penetrant MT-
stabilizing natural product, epothilone D (EpoD), to Tg tauopathy mice resulted in dramatic
improvements in several key endpoints, including increased MT density, reduced axonal dystrophy,
diminished tau pathology and a lowering of neuron loss with improved cognitive performance.
Although EpoD progressed to a small Phase 1b clinical trial in AD patients, its future clinical
advancement is uncertain. Thus, there would be considerable value in identifying alternative MT-
stabilizing agents that could undergo more thorough testing in AD and tauopathy patients. Towards
this end, we evaluated additional MT-stabilizing compounds from different classes, with the goal of
identifying alternative and potentially improved candidates for development as disease-modifying
drugs for AD and other tauopathies. This effort led to the identification of a preferred subset of brain-
penetrant MT-stabilizing triazolopyrimidines (TPDs) that compared to EpoD and other MT-stabilizing
natural products, offer notable advantages, including oral bioavailability and easier synthesis. With
NIH/NIA support (U01/AG061173), a systematic exploration of the structure-activity relationships of
TPDs ultimately led to the identification of a structurally novel compound (CNDR-51997) that exhibits
improved MT-stabilizing activity and pharmacokinetic profile. Based on extensive characterization of
this compound, including efficacy testing in two different AD mouse models, we believe that CNDR-
51997 qualifies as a candidate compound for further development. Accordingly, the primary objectives
of this three-year, late-stage U01 proposal are to develop CNDR-51997 through IND-enabling studies
and submit an IND application."
10941669,"Elucidating Context-Specific FERONIA Receptor Kinase Signaling
Project Summary/Abstract
Understanding how cellular signaling pathways achieve specificity is an important question in developmental
biology. FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase is universally expressed and a critical regulator in plant growth,
development and stress responses. Loss-of-function fer mutant has pleotropic effects with reduced plant
growth, fertility and altered responses to stress. The goal of the proposal is to understand how FER signaling
achieves specificity using root as a system in genetic model plant Arabidopsis. The primary roots offer both
spatial and temporal information of root development, and our preliminary single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-
seq) showed that FER-regulated gene expression in root is high cell type-specific, which makes root an ideal
system to study FER signaling specificity. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that FER phosphorylates
transcription factors to regulate gene expression and various biological processes. First, recent multiomics
study demonstrated that FER regulates the expression of thousands of genes including large number of
transcription factors (TFs), suggesting that transcriptome reprogramming is critical for FER-mediated signaling.
Second, it has been demonstrated that FER phosphorylates transcription factors, MYC2 and ABI5, to regulate
plant immunity and seed germination, respectively. Third, scRNA-seq analysis with fer mutant revealed that
FER affects the expression of ~3,000 genes in roots in a highly cell type- and developmental stage-specific
manner. Fourth, AKS (Abscisic acid-responsive Kinase Substrate) family of TFs are FER kinase substrates.
Further genetic and functional data showed that they are major transcription factors functioning downstream of
FER and FER is required for their transcriptional activity. AKS genes have cell type- or developmental stage-
specific expression patterns while FER has a more universal expression, suggesting that FER modulates these
TFs in different cell types in regulating their target gene expression and FER signaling specificity. Based on
these results, it’s hypothesized FER phosphorylates and modulates the AKS TFs in specific cell types and
developmental stages to regulate their target gene expression in achieving FER signaling specificity. scRNA-
seq analysis, tissue-specific gene manipulation by CRISPR/cas9 and complementation, target gene
identifications and transcriptional network analysis are proposed to test the hypothesis. In Research strategy
section1, the genetic, genomic and functional interactions of FER and AKSs will be characterized by
constructing genetic mutants, phosphosite mutations and identifying cell type-specific transcriptional targets. In
Research strategy section 2, scRNA-seq of fer and aks mutants under control and salt treatment will be
performed. In addition to the cell type-specific FER CRISPR knockout mutants we have already successfully
constructed, we will also generate cell type-specific FER complementation lines. Further characterization of the
cell type-specific CRISPR knockouts and complementation lines along with the gene regulatory network
analysis will provide unprecedent new insights into how FER achieves signaling specificity."
10928478,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In the United States, beta-lactam antibiotics are the leading cause of allergic reactions. Cephalosporin
antibiotics, in particular, are the most common cause of drug-induced anaphylaxis and perioperative allergy.
For penicillin allergy, the mechanism of allergy and the antigenic determinants are known; validated penicillin
skin testing followed by drug challenge has a 100% negative predictive value to exclude an immunoglobulin
(Ig)E-mediated reaction. For cephalosporin allergy, the antigenic determinants and mechanism are not known,
and skin testing is not validated. The diagnostic test characteristics of skin testing with native cephalosporins
remain unclear with no sensitivity nor specificity reported. Although beta-lactam cross-reactivity has been
hypothesized to be from the similarity of the R1 side chains, rather than the beta-lactam ring, cross-reactivity
estimates among beta-lactams vary. Furthermore, it is not known whether the variance in cross-reactivity is
due to true allergy versus sensitization based on positive skin testing, given that drug challenges were not
performed on skin-test-positive patients. While an IgE mechanism is assumed for cephalosporin allergy and
supported by skin testing that has been positive, the biology has yet to be characterized, and some
cephalosporin anaphylaxis can occur on the first exposure, which is inconsistent with an IgE mechanism.
Given the complexity of cephalosporin structures and potential epitopes, there may be several distinct biologic
pathways involved in cephalosporin allergy. Future diagnostics in cephalosporin allergy are reliant on
determination of these biological pathways and finding key haptens.
 Current national practice guidelines related to cephalosporin allergy assessment are considered
conditional and based on low-quality evidence. Our overall goal is to identify the optimal diagnostic approach to
cephalosporin allergy and determine beta-lactam cross-reactivity, while discovering the mechanism and
antigenic determinants of cephalosporin allergy to advance future diagnostics. We will do this through a clinical
trial that will generate empirical evidence through novel trial procedures, double-blind skin testing, and double-
blind placebo-controlled drug challenges. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the optimal approach to
cephalosporin allergy evaluation; 2) To assess beta-lactam cross-reactivity in cephalosporin-allergic
individuals; and 3) To investigate the antigenic determinants and mechanism of cephalosporin allergy.
 We will achieve these aims through collaboration with an established network of drug allergy
specialists. Our study is the first clinical trial in drug allergy that investigates diagnostic strategies and
mechanisms for a common and important antibiotic class. This project aligns with NIH/NIAID goals to advance
drug allergy research and PAR-21-083 to support high-risk clinical trials with mechanistic studies."
10929944,"Rapid analysis of patient tumor cell drug responses to reduce metastatic risk
 Background: The current limitations of clinical cancer imaging prevent a clear understanding of how drugs
aimed at cell growth affect the metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in breast cancer
patients. With more than 2.2 million female Veterans, the current incidence of breast cancer predicts that at
least 275,000 female Veterans will confront breast cancer treatment and require effective treatments that
minimize the risk of lethal metastatic spread. Recent advances in CTC analysis have shown that clusters of
breast cancer CTCs have up to 50x higher metastatic potential. The Martin lab discovered unique
microtentacles (McTNs) on the surface of breast tumor cells that increase cluster formation, and are indicative
of the elevated stem cell characteristics that promote breast cancer metastasis. Current cancer therapies that
stabilize tubulin (like taxanes and epothilones) can increase McTNs, stem cell characteristics, tumor cell
clustering, and reattachment. These results emphasize the need to clarify how current drugs affect free-floating
tumor cells so that therapies can be better tailored to individual patients and reduce long-term metastatic risk.
 Objective/Hypothesis: Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of tumor cell biologists, bioengineers,
and breast cancer clinicians; the objective of this project is to use a novel microfluidic device to rapidly image
free-floating breast tumor cells and define 3 phenotypes that are predictive of metastatic potential (McTNs,
sphere formation, clustering) and key molecular markers. These phenotypes and molecular profiles will be
related to metastatic potential and drug response using clinically-relevant PDX transplants in mice. This study
will test the hypothesis that key functional phenotypes and molecular markers of freshly-isolated breast tumor
cells can serve as immediate indicators of metastatic potential and provide a platform to rapidly test the
responses of individual patient tumor cells to cancer drugs.
 Specific Aims:
 1) Optimize microfluidic cell tethering to measure 3 functional phenotypes of metastatic potential.
 2) Establish molecular framework for tumor cell drug responses in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells.
 3) Define shared molecular and functional characteristics of fresh patient tumor cells, PDX and CTCs.
 Methods: This project will use confocal microscopy to examine 3 phenotypes (McTNs, sphere formation,
and clustering) in breast tumor cell lines and a panel of existing patient-derived xenografts (PDX) supplied by
the Translational Core Laboratory at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center. In parallel, we
will collect fresh patient tumor samples to compare molecular markers and phenotypes in the fresh cells with
the PDX that eventually grow in mice. PDX recapitulate the metastatic behavior of the patient’s original tumor
far more faithfully than any tissue culture model. Phenotypes and molecular markers of individual patient’s
tumor cells will be compared to the molecular characteristics (ER/PR/HER2) of the original patient’s tumor, as
well as growth and metastasis in the PDX model.
 Impact: The completion of this project will establish a framework for defining how the functional
phenotypes of patient tumor cells predict metastatic potential and responses to breast cancer therapies.
Current treatment strategies focus largely on inhibiting tumor growth, so this technology will open a new early
window to help ensure drug treatments avoid inadvertently increasing metastatic risk while targeting tumor
growth. Since this project will focus on FDA-approved breast cancer drugs, the findings can be more easily
translated to impact the clinical treatment of breast cancer by tailoring therapies for individual female Veterans."
10929945,"Universal Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination would significantly decrease cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal,
and oral cancers, and reduce racial disparities in these cancers. However, HPV vaccination rates for U.S.
adolescents of all races, ethnicities, and income levels remain far below national targets. Increasing anti-vaccine
information, limited clinician time to engage with hesitant parents, and backlogs of preventive care incurred
during the COVID pandemic contributed to deficits of HPV vaccination that may years to resolve. Embodied
Conversational Agents (ECAs) are animated computer agents that simulate face-to-face conversation between
a patient and a caregiver, using both verbal and nonverbal conversational behavior, to provide a natural and
intuitive computer interface that is accessible to patients of all levels of health and computer literacy. We have
successfully developed and evaluated this interface in several clinical trials to motivate health behavior change
for a wide range of populations, including a pilot evaluation of an ECA that promotes HPV vaccination for the
families of patients with cervical pre-cancer and cancer. In this project we will adapt this technology to produce
English and Spanish smartphone ECAs for HPV vaccination (ECA-HPV) to provide vaccine recommendations
and motivational interviewing to parents/guardians and vaccine-eligible adolescents and facilitate
communication with clinic staff. HPV vaccine promotion over time can lead to acceptance among parents who
initially decline, and the ECA can provide continual interactions both prior to and following clinic visits. We will
evaluate ECA-HPV in a randomized controlled trial for HPV-vaccine eligible adolescents aged 9-12 to evaluate
ECA-HPV, comparing usual care (UC) (n=175) versus usual care plus four design variants of the ECA-HPV
(UC+ECA) (n= 175 x 4 = 700). All intervention participants will get the ECA-HPV for the parent; the design
variants include inclusion vs exclusion of ECA-HPV for the adolescent and inclusion vs exclusion of clinic
notification of information from the system in a 2x2 factorial design to differentiate the impact of the adolescent-
facing and clinic notification features of the intervention. The research team is nationally recognized as leaders
in HPV vaccination, health literacy, and innovative technologies to improve health. This study will advance our
research on the development of easy-to-use technologies to empower patients. This scalable approach has a
significant potential to reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase adolescent vaccination. If successful, our team
will promote the ECA-HPV through national networks for broad implementation and work to adapt ECA-HPV to
include other childhood, adolescent, maternal, and adult immunizations."
10930143,"Project Summary and Abstract
Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is
known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based
rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor
recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as
an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons
in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the
IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery
following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement
tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this
approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for
tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate
specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery
following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can
quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose
dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key
spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration
are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most
effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased
quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the
field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover,
our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for
developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord
circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a
thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive
track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant
support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four
aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2)
Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI
research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion
and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile."
10930688,"Osteosarcoma (OS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are exceedingly rare cancers, both subtypes of sarcoma,
that arise in bone and smooth muscle respectively. There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease
treatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting
in a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent
need for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of
these tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these
tumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage
adult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical,
genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment
strategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will
leverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and
behavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic
data. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project
(OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the
study. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood
for genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens,
500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data
widely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research,
particularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and
stages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from
the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our
leadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle,
Painter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome
characterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway),
computational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck).
Our Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive
database with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also
aim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied
to other tumors types and patient communities."
10933573,"Prostate biopsies are critical for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but it is often unclear who
should be biopsied and where in the gland the biopsy should be targeted. This results in missed
diagnoses, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of cancer that is not life
threatening. The goal of this proposal is to develop a set of quantitative and non-invasive tools,
RSI-AI and RSI-AI+, to help clinicians determine who should be biopsied for prostate cancer
and the locations of clinically significant lesions. RSI-AI uses deep learning to predict the
location and pathological grade of prostate cancer lesions from restriction spectrum imaging
(RSI) data. RSI is an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that
models the restricted diffusion of water molecules to improve microtissue classification and
tumor detection. By utilizing RSI data in the deep learning model, RSI-AI will produce
pathological grade predictions that are more accurate than models trained with conventional MRI
data. RSI-AI+ integrates the pathological grade predictions from RSI-AI with clinical data
including age, family history, genetics, and prostate volume to accurately and comprehensively
quantify current and future risk for prostate cancer. Phase I of this proposal will develop and
validate the RSI-AI and RSI-AI+ models and compare their performance to models trained with
conventional MRI data. Phase II of this proposal will deploy RSI-AI and RSI-AI+ to the
Cortechs cloud platform, demonstrate their clinical usability and utility, and generate the
materials required for a 510K FDA submission. The clinical software generated through this
proposal will ultimately improve diagnostic yields, reduce unnecessary biopsies and
overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer, while facilitating early detection and appropriate
treatment of clinically significant prostate cancer"
10933255,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1 (OPC-ORN)
Current standard-of-care external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) offers high cure at the cost of severe delayed adverse sequelae.
Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a highly morbid, delayed bone-related complication that at early stages causes
pain and multiple dental procedures, and later stages progresses to jaw fracture, possible oral fistula, and
requires major oral surgery for removal of de-vascularized mandibular bone, thus with substantial implications
on healthcare costs, function, and quality of life. Given the excellent outcomes for HPV-associated OPC and
long-term survival of these typically younger patients, early detection, surveillance, and mitigation of delayed
adverse sequelae such as ORN to improve survivorship represents a major healthcare challenge. Through our
studies we have established elevated DCE-MRI Ktrans as a candidate diagnostic biomarker of mandibular injury
under FDA-NIH BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) definitions, as well as a reasonably likely
surrogate endpoint of ORN. A significant knowledge gap exists relative to the actual incidence, symptom
trajectory and potential biomarkers of ORN development after post-radiation latency this growing OPC survivor
population and innovative strategies are necessary to identify and monitor this chronic/delayed ORN-associated
therapeutic sequela. The challenge of managing therapy-related normal tissue injury represents a significant
unmet public health need. Our work promotes the overarching hypothesis that subclinical mandibular injury
is prevalent before symptomatic manifestation, can be risk-stratified by dosimetric and clinical criteria
before observable ORN, is presaged by both image biomarker and symptomatic progression, and can
be potentially altered by hemorheologic drug candidates. We will develop our approach through the
following Specific Aims (SAs). First, we will prospectively characterize the natural history, temporal symptom,
and candidate imaging biomarker trajectories in OPC survivors at elevated risk of ORN. We aim to prospectively
characterize time-to-ORN disease states and related toxicity events via objective measures, and validate clinico-
dosimetric time-to-event models, including modifying treatments (e.g., proton therapy, pentoxifylline) and
imaging biomarkers. Second, we will define potential toxicity profiles as phenotypic biomarker for ORN-related
toxicity clusters and marker for patient-centered tracking of ORN outcomes. Third, we will evaluate in vivo
revascularization profiles of hemorheologic drug candidates (pentoxifylline vs cilostazol) within a pragmatic
“window of opportunity” trial for patients with advanced ORN planned for image-guided segmental
mandibulectomy/reconstruction. We expect to provide critical knowledge regarding clinical markers, trajectories,
and mitigation of ORN to enhance our efforts to monitor and treat this devastating delayed sequela of curative
treatment."

The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences
schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community
partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and
translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New
York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%)
parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years.
A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform
innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation.
We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health
disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has
catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable
growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into
a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region,
opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the
Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in
2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a
new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational
research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even
further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting
and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational
research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health
informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative
translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium;
2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special
populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes
focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical
informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform
research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand
translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively
contribute to the national consortium.

10934964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The complex health care needs, poorer outcomes, high spending, and sociodemographic composition of the
population living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) pose serious challenges to
families, providers, and health systems and have important implications for health equity. Although the
population living with ADRD is expected to triple by 2050, many recent policy changes aim to maximize the
value of care for the “average” patient, without specific consideration of their consequences for high-cost, high-
need populations, such as those with ADRD. The P01 project will undertake four synergistic projects testing
the effect of recent national policies and payment changes on persons with ADRD in different states of disease
progression, in different care settings, and exposed to different policies. Project 1 seeks to determine the
effects of Medicare Advantage (MA) contract terminations on outcomes for enrollees with ADRD. Project 2
examines the impact of a federal policy to suspend Medicaid redeterminations on health outcomes for people
with ADRD. Project 3 evaluates the impact of the MA Hospice Carve-In policy on end-of-life care for persons
with ADRD. Finally, Project 4 evaluates the impact of a home health payment change on access and outcomes
of patients with ADRD. Each project aims to understand differential effects of financing and payment policies
among persons with ADRD by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status and/or focus the analysis on patients
with low income or other social risk factors. All projects rely upon the Primary Data Collection and Partner
Engagement Core (Core B) and the Data Management and Methods Core (Core C). Core B uses qualitative
methods to gather perspectives from healthcare providers, payers, care partners, and persons living with
ADRD themselves. This will generate critical information about how organizations interact to enact policies and
implement practices that affect healthcare choice, access, use, and outcomes for persons with ADRD. Core C
will make important contributions on three key challenges related to health policy research in ADRD: (1)
accurately identifying the presence of dementia among enrollees in MA plans, (2) developing novel
approaches for causal inference study designs in the aftermath of large-scale shocks stemming from the
COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) integrating data across multiple payers, and institutional and community-based
care. Our robust dissemination plan includes updating and maintaining http://www.ltcfocus.org, a web-site
designed for federal and state policy makers and news media with health and aging interests; and working with
our Strategic Partner Engagement Panels and National Advisory Committee to maximize the impact and
relevance of our findings. Our project will provide timely, novel and rigorous evidence about the impact of
recent payment and financing policy changes for persons living with ADRD and inform policies that improve
care and promote health equity for this important population."
10934967,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 6 million people in the United States currently live with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD), and this number is expected to more than double by 2050. Research has shown that over the course
of disease progression, persons with ADRD have considerable healthcare needs and utilization, often with
poor outcomes resulting from that care. Existing research is largely quantitative, despite increased emphasis
placed on the value of engaging directly with persons with ADRD about their lived experiences. Further,
qualitative approaches are needed to provide insights into how and why quantitative outcomes occur. Thus,
the overall objective of Core B is to characterize the underlying mechanisms by which healthcare outcomes for
persons with ADRD are achieved through qualitative approaches that include obtaining perspectives from a
variety of key informants including healthcare providers, payers, caregivers, and persons living with ADRD
themselves. Core B will centrally unify primary data collection activities of the P01 and serve all four proposed
research Projects, implementing a series of case studies that will collect data used across all Projects. In
addition, Core B will develop and integrate partner advisory panels, which will provide critical insights into
considerations about translating P01 findings, across Projects and Cores, into policy and practice. The aims of
Core B are: 1. To characterize how policies and market forces (structures) and provider and payer behavior
and relationships (processes) influence healthcare choice, access, use, and ultimately outcomes for persons
with ADRD across settings of care. This will be accomplished by conducting case studies in eight healthcare
markets around the country; and 2. To contextualize and translate findings to inform policy and practice based
on feedback and recommendations from our partner engagement panels, representing ""systems-level"" and
""lived experience"" perspectives. Through quarterly engagement meetings, the perspectives gathered from key
informants will inform the integration of qualitative data generated by Core B with the quantitative data of the
four Projects as well as facilitate the translation of research findings into policy and practice. Completion of
these aims is aligned with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goals of enhancing care quality
and efficiency and expanding supports for persons with ADRD and their families. Explicitly, by gathering
perspectives from those for whom the findings are most relevant--healthcare payers and providers and
persons with ADRD--we expect implications will be actionable and translatable into policy and practice."
10934968,"Project Summary
There are over six million people in the United States who currently live with Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias (ADRD) with this number expected to double by 2050. As this population continues to grow, and
receive care from the US Medicare and Medicaid programs, it is essential to conduct rigorous quantitative
analysis to understand how our current care system caring for the complex care needs of this population.
Quantitative research on this topic in recent years has been hindered by two key factors. First, the Medicare
Advantage program has been growing rapidly and now enrolls over 50% of all Medicare beneficiaries. In MA,
private plans are paid to provide for beneficiary care needs, and plans can differ significantly from Traditional
Medicare in terms of the services it provides, and the data it collects. The growth of MA necessitates methods
development to ensure that outcomes and diagnoses are being accurately accounted for. The second
challenge is the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread disruptions in care that make it difficult to
measure the causal impact of policies that were implemented during the same time period. The Data
Management and Methods Core C of this P01 proposal will address these issues and provide the quantitative
and analytic backbone to each of the proposal's four projects. Specifically, Core C will assemble project data
and develop methods for tracking and cleaning longitudinal data, calculate uniform, core measures for use in
project analysis, develop and validate methods for the use of Medicare Advantage data, provide analytic and
statistical support to all projects, develop and test novel methods for conducting longitudinal causal inference
study designs in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and develop new Medicare Advantage data for our
website LTCFocus.org which publicly reports nursing home level statistics and characteristics. This core will
innovate through using newly released Health and Retirement Survey data to validate methods for diagnosing
ADRD in the MA program, perform validations of Medicare Advantage encounter data to ensure their
usefulness in research projects, develop methods for causal inference that incorporate shocks such as the
pandemic, and by making previously availible Medicare Advantage data available for researchers and
policymakers. The work of this core will be impactful by enabling the projects included in this P01, but also
through the validations and methods development which will have broad applicability for other researchers
focused on ADRD."
10934969,"Project Summary
The last decade has brought spectacular growth in the number of people enrolled in the Medicare Advantage
(MA) program, including those with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). One potential but
poorly understood challenge for MA enrollees is that unlike the traditional Medicare program, private insurers
may cease offering services to beneficiaries. From 2011 to 2020, nearly one-fifth of all MA contracts terminated
participating in the Medicare program. Terminations may be particularly disruptive to beneficiaries with ADRD
who may struggle to identify an optimal plan that meets their needs from an often-bewildering set of choices.
Terminations typically require switching to a MA plan with different benefits, out-of-pocket costs, physician
networks, and medication formularies, or to the traditional Medicare program. To mitigate the potential negative
consequences of contract terminations, the Medicare program has used default assignments to automatically
switch low-income or dual-eligible beneficiaries to the traditional Medicare program and a randomly assigned
Part D plan. Our preliminary work suggests that these default assignments have strong effects: dual-eligible
beneficiaries in terminated contracts have markedly higher rates of switching to traditional Medicare compared
with other enrollees. Little is known about the consequences of MA contract terminations and default
assignments, particularly for people living with ADRD, a population with complex clinical and social needs. This
mixed-methods project examines the effects of contract terminations on outcomes for MA enrollees with
ADRD. We focus on those with ADRD given this population's substantial care needs, risk for adverse
outcomes, and the cognitive burden required to make high-stakes and time-sensitive insurance decisions. Our
central hypotheses are that: (1) MA contract terminations will have negative health consequences for
beneficiaries with ADRD, and (2) these effects will be magnified for persons with ADRD who are forced to
make an active insurance decision (or face the loss of drug coverage) compared to those automatically
assigned to traditional Medicare and Part D coverage. Specific aims include: 1. examine the impact of contract
terminations on acute hospitalizations and mortality among persons with ADRD; 2. determine the effect of
enrollment in traditional Medicare vs specific types of MA plans following a termination event; and 3.
characterize the consequences of contract terminations through interviews with key informants and
engagement with an advisory panel including persons with ADRD and caregivers. We innovate by applying a
regression-discontinuity design and leveraging Medicare's default assignments to draw causal inferences
about the effects of enrollment in MA contracts vs. traditional Medicare for people with ADRD. By providing
rigorous evidence about the impact of terminations for beneficiaries with ADRD, our study has the potential to
inform federal policy decisions about MA contract terminations and default assignments following these events."

The overall goals of the Administrative Core of the NCI-supported Mayo Clinic SPORE in hepatobiliary cancers
(SPORE) are to stimulate and support innovative research in liver and biliary cancers and to expedite the
translation of discoveries into more effective methods of prevention, detection, and treatment of these lethal
cancers. The Core has addressed these goals successfully as the organizational hub of the SPORE during the
current funding period. During the next funding period, this Core will continue to provide an organizational
structure that coordinates the activities of translational research projects, scientific cores, community outreach,
Developmental Research Program, and Career Enhancement Program at all three Mayo campuses and affiliated
institutions (NCI, Rockefeller University, University of Pittsburgh). The Core coordinates the advisory functions
of the Internal and External Advisory Boards, Patient Advocates, and the Community Engagement and Diversity
Council. The SPORE leadership, Drs. Mark McNiven and Lewis Roberts, bring together unique and
complementary expertise with synergistic efforts and are Co-Directors of this Core. This team has functioned
successfully in the ongoing funding period, while identifying multiple opportunities to improve Core operations.
Meaningful changes during the first four years that have markedly improved this SPORE included 1) recruitment
of new and accomplished Advisory Board members aligned with new directions of the SPORE translational
projects, 2) formal engagement of the Patient Advocates in SPORE evaluations and decision making, 3)
formation of a new Community Engagement and Diversity Council to ensure inclusivity of underrepresented
populations in patient communities, among SPORE leadership, and SPORE investigators, and 4) new seminar
series and educational activities for SPORE investigators. The Core will continue to 1) provide leadership,
organizational, administrative, and scientific support for all SPORE activities, 2) facilitate successful translational
research collaborations, 3) ensure administrative management, fiscal oversight, and compliance to NIH policies,
4) promote community engagement, diversity initiatives, and activities of the patient advocates, 5) hold advisory,
planning, evaluation, and scientific meetings and communicate new developments and opportunities to SPORE
investigators, the scientific community, and the public, 6) oversee formal scientific review of SPORE research
projects and ensure quality control, 7) ensure participation in NCI-sponsored activities, 8) coordinate participation
of investigators in educational seminars, 9) secure and provide additional institutional support for translational
projects, cores, pilot projects, and investigators, 10) ensure cross communication and integration within the
SPORE, with the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and with other SPOREs, 11) oversee enrollment
of the cancer patient population and access to biospecimens, and 12) ensure integrity of all data and intra-
SPORE integrated data management. These aims build upon strengths developed during the current funding
period towards advancing the prevention, detection, and treatment of liver and biliary cancers."
10935705,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to develop the first diagnostics and therapeutics for the often-fatal
pediatric liver cancer fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC). Timely diagnosis of FLC is a
challenge: the symptoms are non-specific and often appear late in the disease; no useful
biomarkers have been identified; and even following biopsy, diagnosis of FLC can remain
ambiguous. Effective therapeutic options are limited, as FLC does not respond well to
chemotherapy. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately, FLC is often
diagnosed after the tumor has metastasized and curative resection is not an option. As a result,
the overall 5-year survival rate of FLC is only 30%-45%. Given the low survival rate and lack of
treatment options, there is a pressing need for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
The overarching research objective of this project is to characterize the functional response of
FLC driven by the DNAJB1::PRKACA oncoprotein, understand the basis of this functional
response, so that precision medicines and diagnostics can be delivered for a broad class of
patients. All is in place for such advances: The driver for this cancer has been identified; the
transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome and metabolome have been characterized; there are
validated model systems including genetically engineered mice, patient-derived xenografts and
screens on cells fresh from patient resections (1) and patient-derived organoids.
Agents directed against the oncogenes upregulated in FLC are not effective, nor are agents
currently being explored in the clinic This indicates the need for alternative approaches. An
agnostic screen of a drug-repurposing library, identified agents that were efficacious against i)
FLC cells dissociated from patient resections ii) FLC cells dissociated from PDX and iii) preclinical
PDX models. Although these therapeutics were not predicted from the transcriptome, an
examination of their biology provided novel insights into the mechanisms of tumor growth and
explained the efficacy of these agents.
This work will expand this approach with a clinically relevant library of agents that have entered
or passed Phase I clinical trials. The goal is to bring some of these agents into the clinic in the
next 5 years. Critical to this project will be the development of new diagnostic tests for following
the efficacy of these treatments and probing for recurrence in patients."

The long-term objective of this project is to define molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) carcinogenesis, therapeutic resistance, and evasion of immune surveillance through
preclinical studies and a first-in-human clinical trial. The project is focused on the mechanisms by which YAP-
TEAD signaling can promote CCA development and survival and proposing TEAD inhibition as a novel
therapeutic approach. The overall objectives are to examine: (a) the dependence of CCA carcinogenesis on
YAP-TEAD signaling and the immunomodulatory mechanisms of YAP-TEAD signaling in preclinical CCA
models, (b) the effects of therapeutic targeting of TEAD in preclinical models of cholangiocarcinoma both as a
single agent and in combination with standard of care chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and (c) the safety and
efficacy of a novel TEAD inhibitor, CTX1009685, in a first-in-human clinical trial for advanced CCA. In preliminary
studies, there were several pivotal observations. First, inhibition of YAP-TEAD signaling decreased CCA cell
viability in vitro and sensitized CCA cells to the combinatorial chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin, a
standard of care treatment for advanced CCA. These in vitro effects translated to decreases in tumor size in vivo
utilizing patient-derived xenograft models. Similarly, extended targeting to include YAP, it’s paralog TAZ, and the
YAP-activating molecule LCK was associated with increased CCA cell death, decreases in tumor sizes in vivo,
and sensitization to gemcitabine and cisplatin. Mechanistically, it was observed that this extended targeting
approach was associated with increases in infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and decreases in granulocytic myeloid-
derived suppressor (G-MDSC) cells. Based on these data, the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that YAP signaling
provides therapeutic resistance in CCA, which can be overcome utilizing selective YAP-TEAD inhibition. The
approach will employ complementary in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches with mouse and human cell
lines, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models to explore the hypothesis in three integrated SPECIFIC
AIMS. First, the team will utilize doxycycline-inducible in vivo models and spatial transcriptomic approaches to
understand the YAP-TEAD mediated initiating events in CCA carcinogenesis and utilize a novel TEAD inhibitor
to evaluate efficacy of TEAD targeting as a therapeutic approach in multiple, fully characterized in vivo CCA
models. Second, the investigators will utilize sophisticated syngeneic CCA models to explore the mechanisms
underlying YAP-mediated immune evasion and explore therapeutic targeting utilizing TEAD inhibition and
clinically approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. Third, a first-in-human clinical trial will be conducted evaluating
safety and efficacy of the TEAD inhibitor CTX1009685 in patients with advanced CCA. This technically and
conceptually innovative application is also significant because it provides mechanistic insight into therapeutic
resistance in CCA, thus identifying viable therapeutic interventions such as TEAD inhibition and rational
combinatorial approaches with available immunotherapies."

The combination of Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) with the α-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab, and the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeting antibody bevacizumab, has become the new FDA
approved Standard of Care (SOC) for advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). However, the 3-year
survival for this SOC is still <30%, leaving a clear unmet need for novel therapies for advanced HCC patients
who have progressed on first-line ICB therapies. Whilst the immune suppressive liver/HCC tumor
microenvironment (TME) restricts the efficacy of anti-tumor T cell responses, the pro-inflammatory nature of
oncolytic virus (OV) infection/replication offers a complementary mechanism of action to ICB by promoting
immune infiltration (immunological heat) into poorly infiltrated (cold) HCC. Our group has conducted a Phase I
first-in-human study of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) expressing human interferon beta (hIFN-β) in patients
with advanced sorafenib refractory/intolerant HCC. To investigate how OV could best synergize with ICB to
treat HCC, murine Sleeping Beauty (SB) models of HCC were established in which α-PD-L1 ICB induced 30-
50% long term cures through re-invigoration of specific α-tumor CD8+T populations. However, a combination
of α-PD-L1 ICB with VSV-IFNß to reverse immune suppression in the TME, led to the loss of the survival
benefit of α-PD-L1 alone, associated with replacement of a diverse profile of CD8+ T cell populations in α-PD-
L1-treated tumors with a dominant population of highly activated, α-viral effector CD8+T cells. However, by
expressing an HCC tumor associated antigen (HCCTAA) from VSV, the potent α-viral effector CD8+ T cell
response also became an α-tumor T cell response –with highly activated HCCTAA effector cells becoming
focused on the tumor. In parallel studies, we showed that a novel VSV platform in which the CSDE1 protein is
co-expressed within the virus induced significantly better therapy than the parental VSV-IFNß. Finally, to
enhance infiltration of immune-excluded (cold) HCC with effector α-tumor T cells, we developed novel
nanobody-based CAR T cells specific for the TAAHCC GPC3. In others studies, we have shown that CAR T
cells loaded with oncolytic VSV 1). mediate tumor-specific virus delivery and 2). are significantly more
therapeutically potent than conventional, non-loaded CAR T cells. Therefore, to test our overall hypothesis
that the highly immune suppressive HCC TME, which inhibits endogenous α-HCC T cell responses, can be
reversed in the setting of SOC therapies by administration of appropriately timed and optimally delivered
viro/cellular/immunotherapy, we have formulated 3 Specific Aims: 1: To test how appropriately timed VSV-
CSDE1-TAAHCC virotherapy can optimally enhance SOC immunotherapy in SB models of HCC; 2: To combine
CAR T cell/VSV virotherapy to enhance SOC immunotherapy in murine and human xenograft models of HCC;
and 3: To test the safety of adjuvant VSV-CSDE1-GPC3 virotherapy in a Phase I clinical study as therapy in
patients with advanced HCC who have received SOC bevacizumab/atezolizumab."

Large-scale longitudinal microbiome studies are increasingly common as they allow investigators to study
temporal patterns of the microbiome, elucidating the forces that shape the microbiome and enabling the
development of microbiota-based interventions. Unfortunately, despite the potential of longitudinal
microbiome studies, few methods exist for analyzing these studies. Also, the few extant tailored methods are
limited, either failing to accommodate the characteristics of microbiome data or failing to properly
accommodate the longitudinal structure, leading to potentially spurious findings. This proposal aims to fill the
critical gaps in methodology by addressing four major areas. Specifically, we aim to develop a comprehensive
and coherent suite of statistical tools for (1) addressing batch effects in longitudinal microbiome data – a
pressing problem as studies are getting bigger or integrated; (2) improved identification of individual taxa
associated with crucial biomedical exposures or outcomes over time; (3) identifying microbiome interaction
network dynamics between taxa within longitudinal microbiome data; (4) visualizing the longitudinal
microbiome data. These approaches are all based on rigorous prior data emphasizing the importance of the
problems as well as the limitations or absence of existing strategies. Our work is motivated by and will directly
enable analyses within three important longitudinal microbiome profiling studies: few studies have the
combination of large cohorts of patients with numerous follow-ups and rich covariates. Consequently, our
methods have the potential to accelerate understanding of the roles of the microbiome in diseases and
therapeutics, especially in the motivating studies that include populations of infants with diabetes and
immunocompromised individuals (patients undergoing kidney or bone marrow transplant). Ultimately, the
deployment of our methods could guide the design and development of novel microbiota-based preventive
and therapeutic interventions."

10939490,"Parent R01 Research Summary: Pregnancy is a state of constant growth, proliferation, and modification in the
immune system between mother and fetus. For this reason, the maternal immune system is at higher risk for
exposures of toxicants during pregnancy. More specifically, toxicants from ambient air pollution are numerous
and many are absorbed directly from the lungs into the blood stream, resulting in concentrations of toxicants
increasing in pregnancy vs. no pregnancy. We hypothesize that exposure to ambient air pollution, specifically
particulate matter less than 2.5 M (PM2.5), could increase the likelihood of immune dysregulation in pregnant
women during, and in the short- and long-term periods after pregnancy. We will test this by the use of an extant
set of samples already collected and stored from a prior NIEHS funded study (PO1). These stored samples are
from cohorts (pregnant vs. non-pregnant) living in Fresno, CA continuously for more than 10 years in which
individual estimate exposures of PM2.5 (and other pollutants) have been quantitated using validated and
published methods. We have stored 200 blood samples during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and longitudinal
samples from the mothers (at birth, at 1 yr post birth, and at 3 yrs post birth). We also have stored samples from
an age matched set non-pregnant, non-parous females from the same area (n=200). Of the n=400 individuals,
approximately 50% live in high vs. 50% live in low PM2.5 exposure areas. Leveraging this unique dataset, we
hypothesize that the immune system (after a single pregnancy) —with a specific focus on regulatory T cells or
Treg--- will be significantly dysregulated in cell subsets, gene expression, T cell receptor, and cytokine responses
in pregnancy vs. no pregnancy and that the extent of this dysregulation will be worsened by exposure to PM2.5.
In addition, we will test if these mechanistic differences are driven by underlying epigenetic changes. Moreover,
the experimental design, which is longitudinal and covers year-to-year time points will be used to test exploratory
hypotheses surrounding sustainability of these changes since we have collected short term vs. long term time
points after pregnancy. Supplement Research Summary: The extent of PM2.5-induced gene expression changes
in B-cells and Monocytes during pregnancy vs. no pregnancy is unknown. Therefore, we will conduct global gene
expression profiling of monocytes and B-cell subsets and perform the comparative transcriptome analysis on
sorted monocytes and B-cells from maternal blood vs. cord blood exposed to high vs. low PM2.5 levels (Subaim
1b). Our primary hypothesis is that during pregnancy high exposure to fine particulate matter PM2.5 modulates
the epigenetic mark on maternal immune system, by inducing cell type specific epigenetic modifications. To
determine the mechanism of PM2.5 mediated changes in pregnancy, we will perform integrative multi-omics
analysis and reconstruct the regulatory map of B-cells and monocytes. We will perform integrative analysis of
single cell methylome, single cell histone modifications, single cell RNAseq and Luminex datasets to reveal novel
regulatory (or causal) relationships associated with PM2.5 exposure."

Endothelium plays a vital role in hemostasis and thrombosis. It is essential to maintain blood fluidity, but it also
expresses and releases numerous “factors” that regulate blood cell activation and coagulation. Among these,
von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an essential plasma hemostatic factor released by the endothelium. Deficiency
of mature vWF is the most common bleeding disorder in humans. On the other hand, elevated plasma levels of
vWF, or abnormal concentrations of its high-molecular weight multimers, is associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular morbidity. As such, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie regulated release
of vWF have broad implications in hemostasis and thrombosis. One factor that plays a crucial role in normal
vWF exocytosis from endothelial cells is unimpaired biogenesis of its storage granules, the Weibel-Palade
bodies (WPBs), which is a highly complex process that remains poorly characterized. We have previously
shown that deficiency of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex 2 (BLOC-2) results in impaired
vWF exocytosis. Since, BLOC-2, and other related trafficking proteins, are essential for biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles, a group of specialized granules that includes platelet dense granules and
melanosomes, it seems plausible that this protein complex is also required for biogenesis of WPB. We
hypothesize that BLOC-2-mediated endosomal trafficking is critical for biogenesis of WPB. We further
postulate that the exocyst complex plays an essential role in WPB trafficking by 1) interacting with BLOC-2 in
its role in endosomal trafficking 2) and regulating soluble NSF adaptor protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated
fusion of WPBs at the plasma membrane. In Aim 1, we will characterize cargo trafficking from the endosomes
to the maturing WPBs and the dependence of this pathway on BLOC-2. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of
the exocyst complex in BLOC-2-dependent endosomal trafficking and characterize the core trafficking
machinery involved in this pathway. And, finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the regulatory function of the
exocyst complex in SNARE-mediated fusion of WPBs at the plasma membrane.

10943411,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread genomic parasites that occupy nearly half of the human
genome. The selfish replication and movement of TEs are generally harmful to organisms, and eukaryotic
hosts primarily defend against these adverse effects by depositing repressive epigenetic marks at TEs to
silence them. Our recent investigations suggest an evolved balance of this process—the epigenetic silencing
of TEs needs to be strong enough to reduce TEs’ harmful replicative movement, yet weak enough to avoid
inadvertent spreading of repressive marks to TE-adjacent functional sequences. Interestingly, growing
evidence shows that epigenetic modifications can be altered by diet, because dietary metabolites and nutrients
can act as substrates, cofactors, or inhibitors for enzymes responsible for such epigenetic modifications.
However, a critical knowledge gap remains regarding how diet-mediated changes in epigenetic modifications
may influence the epigenetic silencing of TEs and, thus, organismal health. We hypothesize that dietary
changes can negatively impact organismal health by perturbing the evolved balance of TE epigenetic silencing
through both weakened and enhanced TE silencing. We will leverage TE natural variation and combine that
with functional genomics and experimental genetics to address our evolution-driven hypothesis. Drosophila will
be used as a model system for its ease of handling for large screens, its shared mechanisms of epigenetic
regulation with mammals, and its unique TE features that offer an informative model for human TEs. We will
conduct large screens to identify dietary factors that alter the balance of TE epigenetic silencing and the
involved epigenetic modifying enzymes. This effort will use our newly developed fluorescence reporter system
that enables efficient quantification of the strength of TE silencing (Aim 1). We will perform epigenomic and
transcriptomic analyses of wildtype strains fed control and altered diets to characterize varying dietary
responses of TEs across the genome. This genome-wide profiling will use natural polymorphism of TEs and
compare the epigenetic states of homologous sequences with and without a TE insertion, pinpointing diet-
mediated changes at individual TEs. Using these functional genomic data under altered diets, we will also
investigate the predicted functional outcomes of perturbed TE silencing—elevated TE activity due to weakened
silencing or excessive spreading of repressive marks to TE-adjacent genes due to enhanced silencing (Aim 2).
Finally, by using pharmaceutical intervention to revert the functional outcomes of perturbed TE silencing, we
will directly quantify dietary fitness impacts that are mediated by altered TE silencing (Aim 3). By exploring
dietary factors that influence how organisms defend against TEs, and the subsequent impacts on genome
function and organismal fitness, this project will reveal previously unknown mechanisms by which diet acts
through epigenetic modifications to influence individual health. Our findings will provide a novel perspective for
gauging the full impacts of the ongoing and rapid shifts in human diets on our health."
10942723,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common and functionally limiting symptoms reported by cancer
survivors. While no standard of care exists for CRF management, clinically supervised exercise is one of the
best-known interventions for CRF. Exercise prescription (ExRx) for survivors, however, is currently guideline-
driven, lacking personalization and limiting overall efficacy. Rural cancer survivors experience poor health
outcomes, including increased risk of CRF, have limited access to clinical exercise programs, and stand to
benefit from improved ExRx personalization. The long-term goal of this investigation is to develop an effective
telehealth exercise program for rural cancer survivors with CRF. While many investigations of interventions for
rural survivors focus on the implementation of established services, this proposal utilizes innovative accessible
methodology to integrate assessments of exercise-associated mechanisms of CRF remediation into a clinical
efficacy trial. The purpose of these assessments is to provide the foundation for future innovations in improved
ExRx personalization, optimizing individual survivor outcomes, and to do so first in an underserved population
that stands to benefit from the outcomes. This investigation will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims.
Aim 1 investigates the efficacy of a novel telehealth exercise program for rural cancer survivors with CRF (the
BfitBwell Telehealth Program [BfitBwell-TP]) in a randomized control trial. Rural breast and prostate cancer
survivors within five years of completing curative treatment and experiencing CRF (N=134) will be recruited into
the intervention or wait-list control group. A pilot investigation of BfitBwell-TP demonstrated feasibility,
acceptability, and similar reductions in CRF compared to the clinically supervised program upon which it is based.
BfitBwell-TP utilizes existing telehealth methodologies to deliver a combination of synchronous and
asynchronous exercise sessions paired with CRF monitoring and symptom-triggered ExRx personalization to
support CRF improvement. Aim 2 examines the effects of impaired objective physical function and fatty acid
oxidation on reduced CRF response to exercise during the intervention with integrated within-program (every
two weeks) remote assessments. Both have been associated with fatigue and both can be specifically targeted
by ExRx personalization. Recent advances have allowed the remote assessment of objective physical function
and the use of remotely collected, stable dried blood spot (DBS) samples in metabolomic analyses of impaired
fatty acid oxidation. Finally, Aim 3 explores additional biomarkers of exercise-associated CRF remediation
through the investigation of dynamic exercise metabolic profiles established during controlled, laboratory-based
exercise sessions. This Aim performs necessary work to provide the foundation for the development of remotely
assessed dynamic exercise metabolic profiles. This proposal is significant because it utilizes an accessible
intervention to reduce CRF in underserved rural cancer survivors and integrates innovative methodology to drive
continued improvement in this intervention, ultimately reducing the burden of cancer for rural survivors."

Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."

RNA interference (RNAi) pathways are critical regulators of cellular programs conserved across eukaryotes.
Target-specific RNAi-mediated regulation for thousands of loci is achieved with a small set of Argonaute (AGO)
proteins, each complexed with many diverse small RNAs. RNAi defects trigger catastrophic mis-regulation of
gene expression associated with genetic diseases, tumorigenesis, aberrant development, and sterility.
Moreover, disruption to RNAi-mediated gene regulation impacts maintenance of cellular identity and allows de-
repressed transposons to wreak havoc on the genome. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of the highly complex
molecular mechanisms of RNAi pathways, and how they are impacted by real-world stresses, is fundamental to
advancing our knowledge of small RNAs in human health and disease. While we understand the basic
mechanisms of RNAi-mediated regulation we know very little about how RNAi pathways are controlled to
preserve appropriate gene expression. After all, what regulates a regulatory network?
Mechanisms of RNAi homeostasis have remained largely unexplored, in part because studying RNAi
homeostasis without functionally inactivating one or more RNAi factor has not been feasible. Our preliminary
work identified the first two feedback mechanisms that maintain balance amongst the RNAi pathway branches.
One of these feedback motifs enabled us to create a novel mutant that makes studying the effects of disrupting
RNAi homeostasis without altering the function of any factor possible. Experiments leveraging this mutant
revealed that perturbations to RNAi homeostasis negatively impacts a wide range of physiological processes. In
this proposal, we build upon these discoveries to address three fundamental questions with the goal of advancing
our understanding of how RNAi-mediated feedback regulates RNAi function to maintain cellular homeostasis.
The questions will explore the mechanisms of target transcript sorting amongst distinct RNAi branches, how
RNAi pathways are temporally regulated throughout development, and the molecular and physiological
consequences of disrupting RNAi homeostasis. Findings from this work will enable us to build a comprehensive
model of the feedback regulatory architecture that coordinates the overlapping network of RNAi pathways.
Additionally, this work will further our understanding of how real-world stressors impact gene regulation.
Ultimately, this work will transform our understanding of RNAi by establishing mechanistic knowledge of how
RNAi homeostasis facilities the interactions between RNAi and other cellular pathways that coordinate many
physiological processes. Addressing these fundamental questions is critical for our understanding of small RNAs
in human health and is important for the development of bioengineering techniques that harness the power of
our own regulatory networks for use in therapeutic synthetic gene regulation. Therefore, findings from the
proposed work will support the National Institute of Health mission, which aims to foster fundamental discoveries
that aid in protecting and improving human health."

Social relationships benefit mental and physical health, while poor quality social interactions are associated
with worse health and higher mortality. The abilities that underlie social function are impaired in Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There has been substantial progress in identifying genes that are associated ASD.
But the link between ASD genetic factors and core social disruptions is unclear. Even in non-ASD individuals it
is not clear how these genes influence social behavior. To understand how these genes influence social
behavior, we must uncover how they impact the neural circuits that underlie social function. Many key social
functions are traced to a network of connected brain regions that is similar in rodents and primates. This
presents an opportunity to determine the impact of high-risk ASD genes on the function of key connections
within this social network. Prior research demonstrates that prefrontal cortical (PFC) connections to amygdala,
particularly anterior cingulate (ACC) excitatory projections to basolateral amygdala (BLA), play a fundamental
role in encoding social information and motivating social behaviors. Social behavior must be flexible in
response to shifts of extrinsic conspecific behavior and intrinsic social drive. ACC-BLA guides behavioral
adaptations during these shifts. This behavioral flexibility likely requires synaptic plasticity. NRXN1 (Nrxn1 in
rodents) is a high confidence ASD gene, and Nrxn1 disruption replicably impairs social behaviors in rodents
and weakens PFC-BLA synapses. There is much known about the importance of neurexin 1 protein in synaptic
functions, but it is not understood why Nrxn1 disruption leads to social impairments. In this project we propose
that neurexin 1 at PFC-BLA synapses is positioned to influence synaptic plasticity during social experience. A
goal of this research is to determine if neurexin 1 impacts rodent social behaviors by preferential modulation of
ACC-BLA synapses. We hypothesize that nrxn1 has circuit-specific actions on ACC-BLA and, through this,
nrxn1 contributes to flexibility of social behavior and ACC-BLA plasticity. This will be tested using a
combination of acute interference with neurexin 1, gene knockouts and circuit-specific knockdown in rats, while
measuring social behaviors that rely on PFC-BLA integrity, BLA responses to social stimuli, and PFC-BLA
synaptic function. These studies will provide us with a new understanding of the role of neurexin 1 in
modulation of a PFC-BLA circuit that is required for social flexibility. This novel information would help bridge a
known genetic social influencer with the neurobiology of social function."

Cell competition removes mutated cells and enables robust tissue development, eliminates oncogenic cells
in adulthood, as well as damaged cells during aging. We identified activin A as an important player during
cell competition, which we uncovered to be a major actor in liver repopulation by transplanted cells. We
showed that activin A is produced by hepatocytes and increased in aging liver. Highly proliferative fetal liver
stem/progenitor cells exhibit reduced activin receptor expression, are resistant to activin A, and therefore
have a growth advantage compared to mature hepatocytes. As a result, transplanted fetal liver cells are
capable to repopulate normal liver. In livers with advanced fibrosis, fetal liver cells differentiate into
functional hepatic cells, effectively replace injured liver, and exhibit anti-fibrotic effects. Although fetal liver
cells exhibit the capability to repopulate the liver, they will likely not be used for human cell transplantation.
Thus, we hypothesize that modulating hepatocytes or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived tissues to
express crucial features of fetal liver cells will generate ‘winners’ capable of effectively restoring liver tissue
mass. Generating a cell source with growth-advantage that is adapted to an injured microenvironment will
allow us to elucidate the mechanism of cell competition, which can be of invaluable therapeutic benefit.
Here we first uncover the mechanism of cell competition in liver, using our rat cell transplantation model and
modulated hepatocytes. Second, we will investigate the liver repair efficacy of competing human
hepatocytes – induced by blocking specifically activin A-signaling, using a small-molecule-based highly
specific activin A antagonist – in diseased liver. Finally, we will use our recently developed human fetal liver
organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells to produce liver progenitor cells with competitive advantage to
repopulate liver in vivo. Our studies will pave the path towards novel approaches for therapeutic cell
transplantation in liver and application for a diverse set of liver diseases in human population."

Copy number variants (CNVs) are contiguous gene deletions or duplications that confer susceptibility to neuro-
psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Thereby, CNVs offer a powerful opportunity to investi-
gate multigenic mechanisms in complex brain disease. Recent studies demonstrate that the 17q12 Deletion
(17qDel) is among the strongest CNV risk factors for autism; however, the mechanisms of circuit dysgenesis
caused by 17q12Dels remain poorly understood. The objective of this research is to define defective neurode-
velopmental mechanisms caused by 17q12 CNVs, particularly 17q12Dels, which represent a high-penetrant,
high-confidence risk factor for autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). To meet this objec-
tive, we have generated unique experimental resources, including: a 17q12Del mouse; and human 17q12 CNV
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (with robust controls), from patients with 17q12Dels, as well as from pa-
tients with reciprocal 17q12 duplications. Our central hypothesis is that the combinatorial haploinsufficiency
of the genes within the interval, including the transcription factor Lhx1, a known regulator of Wnt signaling, dis-
rupts multiple steps in brain and circuit development. Notably, we have discovered that 17q12Del mice exhibit
a spectrum of anterior brain and craniofacial abnormalities. These phenotypes vary depending on the mouse
genetic background, and are akin to, but milder than, the Lhx1-null mouse. The 17q12Del on the inbred
C57BL/6N background displays greater phenotypic severity, including neonatal lethality, compared to
17q12Del mice on the outbred CD-1 background, that survive into adulthood with milder cortical and hippo-
campal abnormalities. We will pursue the following Aims: 1) Define defective transcriptional mechanisms and
molecular pathways in embryonic brain development in 17q12Del mice; 2) Define defective molecular path-
ways and rescue strategies in patient-derived 17q12 CNV neurons; and 3) Define postnatal neurodevelopmen-
tal and behavioral abnormalities in 17q12Del mice on diverse background genetics using MRI morphometry,
molecular and behavioral studies. This research will have a sustained impact on the field given the high level
of significance and innovation: 1) 17q12Dels represent an understudied, high-confidence autism locus; 2) the
study of Wnt signaling will permit convergence of the 17q12Del mutation with other high-confidence autism
genes; 3) we are testing proof-of-concept Wnt-related therapeutics; 4) methodologically, study of an autism-
associated mutation on diverse, mouse genetic backgrounds provides an important, experimental paradigm for
investigating phenotypic heterogeneity; and 5) we use an integrated translational approach, that involves a
multidisciplinary team coordinating cross-species experiments, including in vivo rodent and in vitro human
iPSC models, with clinical studies in patients. This research will permit bench-to-bedside and broadly-signifi-
cant discoveries related to the diversity of phenotypes and treatment responses in neuropsychiatric disorders."

 Traditional lecture-based approach of teaching is rapidly becoming obsolete in a world where
problems are often multifaceted and cross-disciplinary. This is exceptionally true for biomedical
engineering education, where graduates are required to comprehend and apply advanced concepts in
the fields of engineering, biology, and medicine, while simultaneously being able to understand the
importance of commercialization in dissemination of discoveries. In addition, as the worlds of medicine
and engineering continuously merge, biomedical engineers will increasingly often find themselves in
environments considered “clinical” – where an understanding and insight of human factors, ethics,
community engagement, and social interaction will be instrumental. Towards addressing some of these
challenges, we propose the development of an Educational Toolkit for Bioengineering Design,
Entrepreneurship and Service Learning. This novel educational program will enhance the biomedical
engineering education by implementing several additional curricular components. These team-based
courses include:
 1) A junior-level Clinical Needs Finding clinical immersion course with a Service-Learning
 dedication. Students observe and identify healthcare gaps and disparities; and innovate
 projects that are directly relevant to our local healthcare community.
 2) A junior-level course in Computational Tools for Biomedical Engineering Design, teaching
 the essential tools that are required for engineering design and prototyping.
 3) A senior-level course in Entrepreneurial Bioengineering, focusing on commercialization,
 technology transfer, and start-up potential.
 4) A 3-semester spanning Service-Learning class in which students mentor local high school
 pre-engineering design teams focused on biomedical and healthcare topics.
 If the goals of this program are met, students will gain valuable understanding about the role of a
biomedical engineer in a clinical setting, build a network of peer and program faculty support, and develop
a deeper understanding of the career opportunities in science and medicine. They will possess an
understanding about design and commercialization in an engineering context, but are sensitive to aspects
beyond science, such as health disparities and ethical challenges. Furthermore, by emphasizing the
community engagement aspect in the two novel Service-Learning courses, we are encouraging the
students to be the best possible stewards of their education, in growing to serve the communities around
them, and inspiring the younger generation of engineers."

postnatal suppression of Kir3.2 channel signaling
Abstract
Neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive impairment in DS are still unclear, and there is no treatment to
prevent this most common genetic disability. Our long-term goal is to develop treatments ameliorating cognitive
impairment in DS. Recently we discovered that synaptic plasticity and cognition can be restored in DS models
by genetic removal of an extra copy of Kcnj6, the gene encoding Kir3.2 (Girk2) subunits of potassium channels.
These channels, known for their critical role in neuronal hyperpolarization, are highly expressed during early
postnatal development suggesting their involvement in the formation of neural circuits. Our central hypothesis
is that, in DS models, increased signaling through Kir3.2 channels reduces the spontaneous activity of
neonatal neurons, thus affecting synaptogenesis and the formation of neural circuits, which ultimately
leads to cognitive impairment. Accordingly, suppression of Kir3.2 channel signaling during the early
postnatal period can normalize the neural circuits, thereby reducing neuronal, synaptic, and cognitive
abnormalities in DS. Two Specific Aims will used to test this hypothesis. Aim1. To examine the effects of the
Kcnj6 gene dose on the development and maturation of neural circuits in mouse genetic models of DS. Formation
and maturation of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic connections will be examined in the hippocampus of
DS mice containing either 2 or 3 copies of Kcnj6 (Ts65Dn/Kcnj6++- vs. Ts65Dn/Kcnj6+++ mice).
Electrophysiological, biochemical, and histochemical techniques will be used to assess the effects of Kcnj6 gene
dose on: (i) Neuronal properties affecting the activity of neonatal neurons; (ii) The efficiency of synaptic
depolarizing GABA action before the ‘excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA switch’ (P5 - P12); (iii) The efficiency of
GABAergic inhibition after the ‘excitatory-to-inhibitory GABA switch’ (P14 – P22); (iv) Development of
synchronized neonatal neuronal activity indicative of the formation of neural circuits; (v) Developmental changes
in synaptic plasticity. These studies will show the role of the Kcnj6 gene in the formation of neural circuits and
give a basis for monitoring post-treatment changes in the Aim 2. Aim 2. To examine the effects of early postnatal
treatments reducing signaling through the Kir3.2 subunit-containing potassium channels on the development
and maturation of neural circuits in DS models. Kir3.2 channel signaling will be reduced in a time- and region-
specific manner via: (i) Neonatal intraventricular AAV delivery of Kcnj6 siRNA; (ii) Intraperitoneal injections of
selective GABAB receptor antagonists. Consequences of these treatments will be examined in neonatal and
adult mice. Following properties will be assessed: changes in Kir3.2 channel signaling, properties of neonatal
neural circuits, post-treatment changes in GABAergic synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. This data
will provide information on the role of Kcnj6 gene in synaptic, structural, and functional abnormalities in DS, and
provide a ‘proof of principle’ that time-limited postnatal suppression of Kir3.2 channel signaling can be used to
improve brain functions and cognition in DS."
10902244,"This proposal requests partial support for the FASEB Summer Research Conference on Dynamic
DNA Structures in Biology, which will be held July 21-26, 2024, in Melbourne, Florida. DNA forms a
variety of non-canonical structures that are important for the proper regulation of essential
molecular processes such as replication, recombination, and transcription. However, these
structures can also promote mutation of repetitive regions and other DNA sequences, resulting in
more than 30 inherited disorders. Recent advances in the field have led to new insight into how
environmental factors and endogenous cellular processes promote DNA structure changes, and the
involvement of dynamic DNA structures in human disease. The long-term goal of this conference is
to understand the mechanisms by which DNA structures form, are resolved, and create genomic
instability, with emphasis on their relationship to diseases and the development of potential
therapies. Our aims are to explore recent research relevant to DNA structural transitions, to
highlight new discoveries and technologies in the field, to promote the career development of
trainees and young investigators, and to establish a conference culture that will lead to new
collaborations. To this end, we will bring together ~100 participants for five focused and highly
interactive days of science. The program will include an opening keynote talk, ten scientific
sessions, and informal poster sessions. Emphasis will be placed on new technologies, including
computational and single molecule biophysical analyses, that can analyze the effects of cellular and
environmental factors on DNA structure formation and resolution. In response to feedback from the
previous conference, we will have new sessions this year on novel technologies for the analysis of
dynamic DNA and the roles of structured DNA in transposable elements, viruses, and parasites.
Nearly one-third of the talks will be chosen from submitted abstracts, with preference given to junior
investigators, trainees, and new conference attendees. Other new features are the purposeful
inclusion of several industry experts as invited speakers and the use of discussion leaders to
synthesize the state of the field at the beginning of each session. These changes will support the
uniqueness of the Conference in bringing together scientists from diverse fields with a common
focus on dynamic DNA transitions and provide a supportive and interdisciplinary environment in
which new investigators and trainees can interact with field leaders to share their findings and
develop new collaborations."
10943749,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We developed and translated CD28 costimulated chimeric antigen receptor (M28z CARs) T cells that target mesothelin
(MSLN), a cancer-associated antigen that is overexpressed in a majority of solid tumors; 65 patients have been treated in
phase I/II trials, with no on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Having demonstrated that regionally administered CAR T cells avoid
pulmonary sequestration and are enhanced by early antigen-activated CD4 CAR T-cell helper function, we delivered M28z
CAR T cells intrapleurally in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), promoting tumor infiltration. To
overcome antigen stress–induced T-cell exhaustion, we treated 27 patients with MPM with an anti-PD1 agent after a single
dose of intrapleural M28zCAR T cells (median survival 18 months vs. 10 months following second line pembrolizumab).
To facilitate tumor-specific checkpoint blockade and to achieve functional persistence without repeated administration of
anti-PD1 agent, we translated a CAR T-cell–intrinsic PD1 dominant negative receptor (PD1DNR); 8 patients have been
treated, with no CAR- or PD1DNR-related toxicities. Recognizing the necessity of the IFNγ pathway for solid tumor killing
by CAR T cells, we exploited a c-KIT mutation, D816V (KITv), as a costimulatory domain (Nat Cancer 2023). A single
infusion of M28zKITv CAR T cells was safe, resisted TGFβ-mediated suppression, prolonged survival, and demonstrated
functional persistence in multiple solid tumor models including in low-antigen expressing tumors; clinically available kinase
inhibitors are effective as on/off, tunable safety switch. Herein, we hypothesize that, whereas IFNγ-mediated cytotoxicity is
the predominant mechanism of KITv CAR T cells against high-antigen-expressing targets, for low- or non-antigen-
expressing targets, IFNγ-mediated upregulation of ICAM1 on tumor cells facilitating LFA1(CAR T-cell)-ICAM1 synapse
(increased avidity) and apoptosis of IFNγ receptor–expressing target cells are the respective biologic mechanisms (Aim 1),
KITv-induced IFNγ potentiates the cytotoxicity of CD4 41BBz KITv CAR T cells against low-antigen-expressing targets
and that CD28 costimulation promotes the helper function of CD4 28zKITv CAR T cells; however, PD1DNR is essential
for functional persistence (Aim 2), and that PD1DNR-mediated checkpoint blockade extends beyond PDL1-expressing
tumor cells and counteracts PDL1-overexpressing M2 macrophages (Aim 3). The significance of our approach lies in its
effective combination of a solid tumor–specific scFv that is on target and safe (MSLN), costimulatory domains (KITv,
CD28), checkpoint blockade (PD1DNR), and tumor infiltration (regional delivery). The impact of our proposal extends
beyond pleural cancers; the majority of aggressive solid tumors express MSLN. The proposal’s innovations include—
exploiting IFNγ-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms in a heterogenous antigen-expressing solid tumor, increased CAR T-cell
avidity through a second synapse, potentiating CD4 CAR T-cell helper function to augment CD8 CAR T cells and
counteracting PDL1-expressing M2 macrophages by the CAR T-cell intrinsic PD1DNR."

Recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have enabled the comprehensive profiling of
gene expression across tissues while preserving crucial gene location information. However, the current
accessibility of commercialized ST platforms remains constrained by their high costs and long turn-around time,
limiting their utility in large-scale ST studies that involve hundreds or thousands of samples. In contrast,
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histology images are much cheaper to generate. Previous studies have
demonstrated correlations between gene expression patterns and histological image features, suggesting the
potential to predict spatial gene expression from histology images. Therefore, the integration of histology image
data for predicting spatial gene expression in large-scale ST studies has emerged as a promising strategy. This
novel approach facilitates the generation of virtual ST data at significantly reduced costs and time commitment.
Through these predictive models, we can investigate the intricate connections between spatial gene expression
variations and clinical outcomes of interest, with a particular focus on population-based inquiries, such as those
in biobank samples. Leveraging our team's expertise in ST data analysis and computational pathology, we
propose to develop a suite of informatics tools to harmonize information from histology images and integrate it
with ST data with diverse spatial resolutions and gene coverages to build gene expression prediction models.
We will further investigate optimal sample selection strategies for ST when conducting a large-scale ST study.
These tools will make it possible to predict ST data at single-cell resolution from samples where only histology
images are available. To enhance the impact of our research, we will also develop open-source software
packages and build a cloud-based computing platform for ST data prediction and visualization in large-scale
studies. Realizing the proposed research would signify a transformative advancement in the field, potentially
leading to a paradigm shift."

Accumulating evidence supports that B cell can regulate immune responses and are essential for limiting
inflammation and autoimmunity by IL-10-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The processes and
mechanisms by which B cells with regulatory properties are generated have also not been identified. We have
shown that Tim-1 is also expressed on B cells that produce IL-10 and Tim-1 is required for apoptotic cell (AC)
binding to B cells and induction of IL-10. We generated a mouse with a conditional deletion of Tim-1 selectively
on B cells (Tim-1BKO). The Tim-1BKO mice show progressive loss of IL-10 production in B cells and, with age,
developed severe multi-organ tissue inflammation including colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis and a paralytic disease
with meningeal inflammation in the CNS. On the other hand, Tim-1BKO mice show strong anti-tumor immunity
with inhibition of tumor growth. Therefore, in addition to serving as a marker for regulatory function of B cells,
Tim-1 as a phosphatidylserine receptor is also functionally required for optimal regulatory B cell function.
However, it is not clear what induces Tim-1 expression and what are the transcription factors that drive Tim-1
expression and regulatory B cell function. Our data clearly shows that Tim-1 does not define a subset of B cells
but can be induced on B cell upon activation. Based on the preliminary data we hypothesize that Tim-1 is a
functional marker on B cells that can induce IL-10 upon binding to AC and regulate tissue inflammation,
autoimmunity, and anti-tumor immunity. To address this hypothesis we propose to: 1) Identify Transcriptional
Regulators of Tim-1+ B cells, focusing on EHF as the positive regulator of Tim-1, which was identified by a
focused Crispr-Cas9 screen; 2) Study the effect of loss of Tim-1 on B cells in generating pro-inflammatory
effector B cells, as Tim-1BKO B cells are highly activated and produce proinflammatory cytokines including IL-23
and IL-6 which promote differentiation of pathogenic Th17 cells; 3) Study the role of Tim-1+ B cells in maintaining
stem-like Th17 cells and limit differentiation of pathogenic CXCR6+ Th17 cells. We have found that Tim-1+ B
cells produce Wnt10a, which promotes stemness, and other suppressive cytokines that keep Th17 cells in a
stem-like state and limit their differentiation into pathogenic Th17 cells. The proposed studies will greatly increase
our understanding of the role of Tim-1 in B cells and the generation of regulatory activity on B cells to promote
immune tolerance and limit tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. These studies will provide a novel therapeutic
strategy by targeting B cells for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and promoting anti-tumor immunity."

 PGC-1 family proteins (PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and PPRC1) are transcriptional coactivators that act as central
hubs to coordinate diverse cellular inputs to promote the transcription of genes that regulate metabolism to
maintain homeostasis. Transcriptional coactivator Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma
Coactivator 1 β (PGC-1β) is over-expressed in colorectal cancers (CRC) with K-Ras mutations and promotes
the survival of tumor cells. PGC-1 family proteins lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and function by facilitating
interactions between transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and transcription initiation machinery. To identify
the protein-protein interactions required by PGC-1β to promote gene expression we immunoprecipitated PGC-
1β and identified binding partners by mass spectrometry. Our data reveal that Estrogen-Related Receptor α
(ERRα) and Host Cell Factor 2 (HCF2) are PGC-1β binding proteins that we propose are required for PGC-1β
to regulate the transcription of genes that promote CRC survival. Our long-term goal is to inhibit CRC growth
by blocking PGC-1β signaling and we propose that can be achieved by preventing PGC-1β from signaling
through either ERRα or HCF2. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which phosphatase PGAM5
modifies PGC-1β to increase ERRα transcription. In Aim 2, we will identify PGC-1β-HCF2 regulated genes and
determine the requirements for HCF2 signaling. In Aim 3, we will test the loss of the PGC-1β, the loss of the
PGC-1β-ERRα interaction, the loss of the PGC-1β-HCF2 interaction, and the loss of both interactions in vivo
using orthotopic submucosal injections in immunodeficient mice receiving Crispr-Cas9-modified patient-derived
tumor organoids establish from liver metastases."

Urothelial cells play an active role in bladder physiology by responding to physical/chemical stimuli and
signaling to sensory neurons and other cell types in the bladder. Numerous bladder diseases affecting millions
of people, including overactive bladder, pain related to recurrent bladder infection, chemotherapeutic cystitis,
and bladder pain syndrome, have been suspected to disrupt urothelial sensory signaling, leading to
pathological changes to sensory signaling, including pain. While it has been accepted that urothelial cells play
a role in bladder sensory function, it is unclear how these cells contribute to the sensation of filling and how it is
altered under painful conditions. To unravel the role of urothelial cells in bladder nociception and sensory
dysfunction, we have developed a novel mouse model that allows for direct stimulation of urothelial cells using
optogenetics. We will functionally and molecularly identify the population of sensory neurons responding to
direct urothelial stimulation of sensory nerve activity in normal and inflammatory conditions. Identifying these
neurons may lead to more targeted therapies for treating visceral pain and sensory disorders associated with
epithelial dysfunction. We will also assess which brain areas increase activity with optogenetic urothelial
stimulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging and compare it to noxious and non-noxious
distension to understand better the sensory information relayed by urothelial cells to the central nervous
system. The results from these studies will allow us to understand better how urothelial cells contribute to
bladder interoception and nociception and under what conditions. Finally, we will examine the impact of
urothelial stimulation on voiding and nociceptive behaviors in freely moving mice before and after induction of
cystitis using wireless light delivery devices. These experiments will give us insight into the role of urothelial
sensory signals behaviorally. The project's overall goal is to evaluate and identify components of the
communication between urothelial cells, sensory neurons, and the brain. Further, we will investigate how this
signaling is changed under altered urothelial function. The results from this proposal will aid in furthering our
understanding of urothelial sensory neuron signaling in aspects of pain. Hopefully, this improved understanding
will lead to better therapeutic targets for bladder pain and other painful visceral disorders."
10942974,"Project Abstract
ASPSCR1::TFE3 (AT3) is a fusion oncoprotein transcription factor expressed from the junction site of a t(X;17)
chromosomal translocation that defines alveolar soft part sarcomas, as well as the largest subset of Xp11-
rearranged pediatric renal cell carcinomas. Both are related deadly cancers with poor prognoses that generally
develop in young patients. Expression of AT3 in mouse models has proven its ability to drive both
sarcomagenesis and renal cell carcinomagenesis, each independent of other genetic perturbations. We
identified that VCP interacts with AT3 in cell lines and human and mouse tumor tissues. The interaction was also
identified at the detailed level of chromatin distribution by heavily overlapping ChIP-seq for each protein, AT3
and VCP, which co-localize to promoters and enhancers across the genome, driving enhancer loop formation.
VCP normally functions as a segregase or unfoldase, removing substrate proteins from membranes, complexes,
or even chromatin. Typically, its inhibition or protein-level depletion leads to metabolic stress from the loss of its
cytoplasmic role in governing quality control of protein folding. However, in AT3 expressing cells, VCP depletion
mimics AT3 depletion itself. VCP depletion not only impacts the transcription of target genes, but also the 3D
architecture of chromatin, where enhancer loops with AT3:VCP are lost upon VCP depletion. Inhibition of VCP
enzymatic activity with a specific small molecular inhibitor also impacts AT3 transcriptional targets, but the
correlation between VCP inhibition and depletion is limited, which suggests that there are impacts of VCP
structural components that are distinct from its enzymatic activity. Preliminary biochemistry and structural
analyses have demonstrated that AT3 interacts specifically with VCP hexamers that retain enzymatic activity.
This all leads to an overall model for AT3-mediated transcriptional reprogramming depending on VCP as a co-
factor. Yet, the precise mechanism of VCP regulating transcription at AT3 target loci remains a critical gap in
knowledge. This proposal will determine the basis of whether VCP enables AT3 transcriptional impacts through
its segregase enzymatic function and as a structural scaffold for higher order chromatin organization. Upon
completion, this proposal will establish the role of VCP as an obligate co-factor of AT3 and its potential as a
novel therapeutic target for the treatment of alveolar soft part sarcoma."

Mammalian cells are constantly challenged by a multitude of environmental stresses. In response, cells trigger
corrective measures to make critical cellular decisions. Dysregulation of these stress response programs are
associated with ageing, neurodegeneration, and cancer. However, the molecular basis of cellular stress
response is largely unknown. While stressed cells globally suppress RNA and protein synthesis, they
specifically induce stress response genes that determine cell fate. The overarching goal of my research is to
understand how mammalian cells regulate gene expression during stress. In this proposed work, we will
investigate the mechanism of two conserved and ill-understood gene regulatory features of stress response –
(1) accumulation of gene regulatory biomolecules within membraneless compartments, called condensates, and
(2) widespread disruption of transcription termination. We recently discovered that cells rapidly accumulate their
multivalent proteome, especially transcription modulators, within subcellular condensates during stress. While
the functions of condensates remain nebulous, it’s been shown that dysregulation or aggregation of condensate
constituents are associated with neurodegeneration. Building on our discovery, we found that heat shock factors
(HSFs), multivalent transcription factors and essential arbiters of proteostasis, form stress-induced nuclear
condensates that localize at cellular sites of elevated transcription. Our data suggest that stress-induced HSF
condensates intensely activate transcription at specific genomic loci and act as transcription hubs. We will
employ this exemplary system to gain a broader understanding of how stress-induced transcriptional
condensates function and how spatial organization drives transcriptional control. Additionally, we found that
disruption of transcription initiation and termination are correlated with sequestration of RNA metabolism
regulators and linked to global transcriptional downregulation during stress. Yet, disrupted termination at specific
genomic loci leads to extensive transcriptional readthrough via unclear mechanisms, culminating in the synthesis
of novel stress-specific transcripts. This phenomenon is also a hallmark of viral infections and renal cancers.
Together, these findings lead to the following questions – (1) How do stress-induced HSF condensates form
and function? We will employ a combination of advanced imaging and spatial-omics technologies that identify
molecular drivers of condensate formation and probe condensate’s function in transcriptional regulation within
cellular models of proteotoxic stress. (2) How do cells mediate stress-associated transcription
readthrough? Using nascent RNA sequencing and epigenomics we will identify epigenetic drivers of
readthrough in validated cellular models of osmotic and proteotoxic stress. We will then use single-molecule
imaging to elucidate the molecular drivers of transcriptional readthrough at individual genomic loci. Overall, this
body of work will advance the understanding of organismal response to stress and resolve long-standing
questions about transcriptional drivers of stress response. Our work will have widespread impact on both
organismal physiology and pathology, uncover novel disease mechanisms and pave the way for new treatments
against maladies driven by harmful exposure to stressors and aberrant stress response programs."
10941845,"The protein composition of a cell, or proteome, responds dynamically to external and internal environments,
and provides fundamental information on biomolecular mechanisms. However, research in these primary
effectors in cellular function is constrained by the lack of high-sensitivity mass spectrometry (MS) approaches
necessary to characterize proteomic changes, such as aging effects across neurons, subtypes of neurons, or
neuronal subcompartments and in/between samples at trace abundance, such as in the cerebrospinal fluid. At
the biological level, aging results from accumulated cellular damage over time, and has been associated with
deterioration of synaptic composition, dysregulation of excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits, and
deleterious proteolytic processing. Here, a new proteomics platform, termed scalable Single-Cell Mass
Spectrometry (SCeMaS), will be developed and validated on biological models of proteins and protein
fragments associated with these biomolecular effects of aging via three independent aims. Each aim is
designed to address contemporary technical limitations that have historically hindered deep MS `omics and
integration with functional tools of research on aging, such as electrophysiology. This project strategically
leverages invertebrate and vertebrate biological models based on their (i) practical advantages to facilitate
specific aspects of technology development, refinement, and validation as well as (ii) established use in
various contexts of research on aging. Giant identified neurons of the crayfish are chosen to advance the
technology of proteome collection and processing with reduced protein/peptide losses than presently feasible.
Specific single neurons will be patched in the mouse to downscale the approach through development of a
sample-enrichment method. To enable recording of live neurons in these models and microanalysis of
proteome degradation in the CSF, a specialized chemical approach will be introduced to remove salt
interferences, thus ushering MS proteomics and electrophysiology to a one-step process. Using limited
populations of cell lines modeling Alzheimer's disease and neuronal subcompartments, MS sequencing will be
advanced by developing a “smart” data acquisition method that alleviates current bottlenecks in bandwidth.
SCeMaS will be validated using each of these biological models, where representative biomarkers are known
and compared to healthy adult samples, aging neural proteomes are expected to be less diverse and show
disrupted stoichiometries and/or homeostasis consistent with abnormal protein production, aggregation, and
proteostasis. This project includes a multidisciplinary team that combines strengths in instrumental
bioanalytical chemistry, aging, neuroscience, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to identify proteomic changes
during healthy aging, accelerated aging in progeria, and in neurodegenerative disease. SCeMaS will enable
scalable and deep MS-based proteomics-peptidomics under physiological conditions, thus expanding the
bioanalytical toolbox of research on aging in these and other biological models."

This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) by Dr.
Nijee Luthra, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. As the number of people with Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is expected to grow to pandemic proportions, cognitive deterioration associated with PD will
prevail in a majority of this population. The integrated career development and research plan proposed for this
K23 award is motivated by an increasing awareness of the urgent need to identify pathways that target
cognitive impairment in PD. Exercise has potent anti-aging effects and can influence cognitive outcomes in PD
but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Identifying biomarkers that respond to exercise, and how they
associate with cognition and underlying disease pathology may elucidate key mechanisms for countering
cognitive decline. This proposal focuses on longevity hormone klotho as a biomarker that may mediate
exercise-induced benefits and contribute to cognitive resilience. Klotho has been shown to enhance cognition,
synaptic plasticity, and brain volumes in mouse models of aging and neurodegeneration. Dr. Luthra and her
team have also recently shown that klotho associates with better cognitive function in PD patients. While klotho
levels decrease with aging and in PD, physical exercise robustly increases klotho levels in healthy adults.
Whether exercise increases klotho in PD and protects against cognitive decline is not yet known. To this end,
the aims of this research proposal are: 1) knowing its positive link with cognition, to now investigate whether
klotho modifies underlying markers of PD pathology, and 2) in parallel, design a pilot study to determine if
klotho increases in response to exercise in PD and correlates with improved cognitive abilities. Answers to
these questions would highlight the potential of klotho as an exercise-related biomarker and as a new pathway
for targeting cognitive dysfunction.
 The research plan is complemented by didactic and practical training in design and conduct of clinical
trials, advanced biostatistical methods, and analysis and interpretation of multimodal biomarkers and cognitive
assessments. To accomplish the goals of this research and training, the candidate has assembled a mentoring
team with decades of experience in clinical trials and exercise interventions, along with expertise in biomarkers
and cognitive impairment in PD. Completion of this research plan and training objectives will allow the
candidate to advance her career in becoming an independent clinical investigator focused on investigating
strategies such as exercise and multiple related biomarkers that mediate cognitive resilience in PD."

Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have reduced health related quality of life (HRQOL) and
impaired exercise capacity. Despite fourteen approved therapies, most patients die within ten years. This grim
fact underscores the need to develop interventions that improve HRQOL, particularly targeting mechanisms
that are non-redundant to existing PAH therapies. Increasing physical activity is highly efficacious in PAH,
resulting in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and HRQOL improvement that often exceeds the effect of
medications. Prior activity studies required inpatient rehabilitation, which is impractical, hard to sustain, and
poorly scalable to a rare disease. Moreover, rehabilitation for PAH is not typically reimbursed by insurance in
the United States, highlighting the need for alternatives to promote physical activity. This application builds on
a recently-completed, NIH-funded pilot and feasibility trial of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in PAH. In
the pilot, subjects wore a Fitbit device and were randomized to either usual care or a fully automated “smart
text” intervention. Text content was based on behavioral change theory and personalized to each subject.
Texts were sent to the intervention arm 3 times/day with encouraging messages based on real-time activity
data. Each subject had a personalized step count target which increased by 20% every 4 weeks. At the end of
12 weeks, the intervention arm took 1019 more steps per day than the control arm, an increase of 20% over
baseline. We now hypothesize that increasing step counts will improve HRQOL in patients with PAH. We
propose a randomized trial of smart texts versus usual care for 6 months. We will randomize 100 PAH patients
to the mHealth intervention or usual care. All enrollment, monitoring, and data collection will occur remotely at
Vanderbilt. We will enroll subjects across the United States, increasing generalizability. Our enrollment targets
are feasible because we are supported by two large, existing PAH cohorts – the NIH-funded PVDOMICS
Consortium and the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry. R61 Milestones (Year 1): IRB approval;
establish DSMB; create REDCap database; Data Use Agreements; programming of text intervention;
enrollment of first 10 subjects. In Aim 1 (primary endpoint), we will test the effect of a text-based mHealth
intervention on HRQOL in PAH using the PAH-specific emPHasis-10 questionnaire. In Aim 2 (secondary
endpoint), we will test the effect of an mHealth intervention on exercise capacity, measured by a highly feasible
and reproducible supervised home-based 6MWD test. In an exploratory aim, we will examine the effect of the
intervention on time to clinical worsening (composite of PAH therapy escalation, PAH hospitalization, and
death) one year after randomization. This proposal will test a novel, highly scalable, and affordable mHealth
intervention to improve clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with PAH."

Developmental Funds (DF) from CCSG support the YCC (Yale Cancer Center) Strategic Plan by directly funding
innovative cancer research and related activities. These funds are leveraged with funds from other sources to
support a diverse portfolio of internal grant programs that launch new areas of cancer research, foster
engagement of YCC members, support junior faculty development, and stimulate collaborations and multi-
disciplinary research in accordance with YCC strategic priorities. During our current funding period, DFs
distributed $2.5M from CCSG in internal grants. CCSG funds are the cornerstone of the entire portfolio of internal
grant activities, and they were leveraged to obtain an additional $7.7M in institutional funds allowing YCC to
distribute a combined total of $10.2M for internal competitions since 2018. Using a conservative return on
investment (ROI) calculation that accounts for the lag between award of the internal grant and acquisition of new
external funding, $1.9M CCSG funds distributed 2016 to 2021 yielded $23.2M new external grants received
between 2017 and 2022, a 12.3-fold ROI, with 35 publications, half in high impact journals. The combined CCSG
and institutional funds distribution during this interval produced an ROI of 9.3-fold, generating 149 publications
with 43% in high impact journals. Notably, our internal grants have historically played a critical role in helping
launch the careers of many YCC members, including most members of the YCC leadership team. In addition to
funding innovative research projects, the YCC internal grants program has several other goals: 1) Encourage
catchment-focused research projects, 2) Support and mentor a diverse cadre of early career scientists, and 3)
Promote out-of-the-box thinking by supporting innovative high-risk/high-reward ideas. YCC internal grants
demand outstanding science as assessed by rigorous peer review process. YCC Administration supports the
DF program by coordinating the application and review process and tracking progress and award outcomes.
Grants are funded in accordance with YCC strategic priorities including research of relevance to our catchment
area and cancer disparities. Following peer review and submission of funding recommendations, the YCC
Director makes the final determination of the awardees. An important new initiative is a recent investment of
~$500k in a Cancer Health Disparities pilot grant program, which will continue with competitions every other
year. YCC also supports retreats and workshops to stimulate collaboration and promote team science that will
lead to future multi-PI grant applications. Funding mechanisms with this specific goal include the Translational-
Targeted Area of Research Excellence (T-TARE) program that played a key role in two successful SPORE grant
applications and the more recently inaugurated Team Challenge Award (TCA) to stimulate P01-type funding.
Planned initiatives include supplementation of CCSG- and ACS-supported grants with other YCC-managed
funds, successful submission of a new SPORE in breast cancer, and further engagement of the local community
in defining research needs, assessing research proposals, and leading community-based research."
10934046,"IRRADIATOR SHARED RESOURCE – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Irradiator Shared Resource (ISR), formerly known as the Cesium-137 Irradiator Shared Resource, was
established in 1991 with a Cesium-137 gamma-ray irradiator to provide accurate, cost-effective, convenient, and
reliable access to ionizing radiation to Yale University investigators for irradiations of molecular compounds, cell
cultures, animal and human tumor cells, and whole animals. In 2022, the Yale Cancer Center (YCC) Shared
Resources Oversight Committee recommended the expansion of the Cesium-137 Irradiator Shared Resource
to include four additional kilovoltage x-ray irradiators and one advanced image-guided small animal research
irradiator (being installed in 2023) and name the expanded resource as Irradiator Shared Resource for the
coming funding cycle. The ISR will have six irradiators offering both gamma- and x-rays with a wide range of
dose rates, collimation, and controlled environment for delivering precise irradiations to biological or chemical
samples. It will continue to serve as an essential and comprehensive resource for YCC researchers who are
studying the effects of radiation on biological samples, animals, and cells in culture or are using radiation as part
of their experiments to create mutations for studying the biologic effect of radiation, or of mutations themselves,
or for immunosuppression. In the last 5 years, approximately 12 (and 34) YCC investigators per year have used
the Cs-137 (and x-ray) irradiators. During the most recent funding period (FY22), 10 (and 29) YCC Principal
Investigators used the Cs-137 (and x-ray) irradiators. Among the total irradiator usage, 86% (and 95%) of the
gamma-ray (and x-ray) use were by YCC members from four research programs. Most of the use came from
Cancer Immunology (CI) and Radiobiology & Genome Integrity (RGI) research programs, followed by the
Genomics, Genetics and Epigenetics (GGE) and Cancer Signaling Network (CSI) research programs. The
results from many basic research studies that involved the irradiators have enabled YCC physicians to improve
their ability to detect and treat cancer efficaciously. The overall objective of the ISR is to continue provide
centralized and comprehensive irradiation services to cancer researchers at YCC. The specific aims of the ISR
are: 1) Provide all YCC members with convenient and reliable access to state-of-the-art gamma-ray and
kilovoltage x-ray irradiators, with cost-effective irradiation services for all YCC members; 2) Provide expert
radiation physics and technical consultation to YCC members on the experimental design involving the gamma-
or x-ray irradiators; 3) Provide hands-on training for the staff of YCC members to ensure accurate, efficient, and
safe use of the irradiators at all times; and 4) Ensure irradiator availability of 24 hrs/day, 365 days/year to YCC
cancer investigator through proactive irradiator maintenance and quality assurance."
10934208,"Current therapies for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are unsatisfactory. We and others discovered splicing
factor mutations in patients with MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and reported that expression of
mutant splicing factors increase the abundance of R loops, which are structures containing DNA:RNA hybrids
and displaced single-strand DNA. R loops trigger an ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint response that
mediates resolution of the R loop to protect cells from genomic instability and cell death. In a phase II trial we
observed activity of Ceralasertib (AZD6738) monotherapy, an oral ATR inhibitor (ATRi), in adult patients with
MDS who relapsed or were refractory to front-line therapy, but combination therapy will be required for more
durable clinical benefit. We recently discovered that splicing factor mutations also activate PARP1 through an
R loop-dependent mechanism, rendering cells sensitive to PARP inhibition. Dual inhibition of ATR and PARP
(PARPi) are synergistic in preclinical models in vitro, suggesting that pathways converging on R loop regulation
may provide a mechanistic approach to target these malignancies. We hypothesize that splicing factor mutant
myeloid malignancies are vulnerable to dual inhibition of the ATR and PARP pathways. In Specific Aim 1, we
will optimize the combination of ATR and PARP1 inhibition using preclinical models of myeloid malignancies
with spliceosome mutations. We will use multiple pre-clinical models to test the tolerability and efficacy of ATRi,
PARP1i, and the combination in vivo: 1) mutant U2af1 and Srsf2 mouse AML models in congenic recipients, 2)
xenografted gene-edited human cell lines labeled with luciferase, and 3) primary human MDS/AML xenografts.
Our goal is to conduct a phase II trial of ATRi + PARP1i in patients with splicing factor mutant
relapsed/refractory MDS based on our findings. As an alternative approach, we propose to inhibit CHK1 (a
downstream target of ATR) using a novel agent with minimal hematologic toxicity. In Specific Aim 2, we will
determine the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to ATR inhibition in myeloid malignancies with and
without splicing factor mutations. We developed independent lines of evidence suggesting that loss-of-function
mutations in RUNX1 are associated with resistance to DNA damage response inhibitors, including ATRi, in
splicing factor mutant cells. We hypothesize that transcriptional changes induced by RUNX1 loss confer
resistance to ATRi by altering R loop metabolism or other mechanisms. We will use a genetically-defined
preclinical model to test the impact of RUNX1 loss on ATRi resistance and identify putative mechanisms of
resistance. We also observed that splicing factor wild-type patients with co-mutations in DNMT3A/ETV6/del7
are sensitive to ATRi. We hypothesize that these mutations confer sensitivity to ATR inhibition by inducing
replication stress, phenocopying splicing factor mutations. We will assess biomarkers of replication stress in
primary human MDS/AML samples. Collectively, this project will nominate combination therapies to develop
the first novel:novel combination of drugs to treat MDS and AML with splicing factor mutations."
10934342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Menkes disease is a rare genetic condition in which the disruption of copper homeostasis induces
neurodegeneration and other neurological symptoms soon after birth. The underlying mechanisms of Menkes
neuropathology remain unclear, but the metabolic changes observed in Menkes disease and the crucial role of
mitochondria in neurons point to dysregulation of cellular bioenergetics as a possible factor. Preliminary data in
human cells indicates that copper depletion decreases expression of genes regulated by hypoxia induced factor
1 alpha (HIF-1α). HIF-1α is a transcription factor sensitive to metals and oxygen that regulates cellular
bioenergetics by switching metabolism from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Further, these
copper depleted cells exhibit increased mitochondrial respiration. Resolving the newly identified role of HIF-1α
in regulating mitochondrial function is central to understanding how copper dyshomeostasis elicits
neurodegeneration in Menkes disease. Thus, the overall objective of this F31 NRSA application is to test how
copper depletion influences the HIF-1α pathway in neurons to regulate cellular metabolism and influence cell
excitability and survival. The central hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal is that neuronal copper
depletion selectively downregulates transcriptional activity of the HIF-1α pathway to redirect nutrients through
mitochondrial respiration rather than glycolysis, rendering cells hyperexcitable due to production of reactive
oxygen species by mitochondria and thus susceptible to cell death. In Aim 1, the HIF-1α pathway will be
stimulated in copper depleted and control neuroblastoma cells or primary cultured neurons in order to
comprehensively assess gene expression, determine binding of HIF-1α to target genes, and quantify
mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in the context of HIF-1α activity. In Aim 2, genetically encoded calcium
indicators will be used in primary neuronal cultures from wildtype or neuronal-specific copper depleted mice while
stimulating the HIF-1α pathway to assess how copper depletion affects cell excitability and determine the effect
of HIF-1α on these phenotypes. Completion of these aims will clarify the metabolic pathways responsive to
copper and their effects on neuronal function. The application of this knowledge will inform our understanding,
research, and treatment of neuropathology of diseases known to be associated with dysregulated metals and/or
metabolism for which there are currently limited therapeutics."

Understanding and Improving Healthcare Decision-Making and Outcomes for People Living with
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
This Program Project analyzes and seeks to improve healthcare practice patterns, decision-making processes,
and treatment effectiveness for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Supported by
a set of cores that draw together clinical and economic expertise, vast novel data sources, and cutting-edge
analytical tools, the component projects focus on the particular decision-making challenges faced by providers,
caregivers, and patients in caring for the complex needs of people living with ADRD and the role these play in
driving disparities in access and outcomes. There are unique aspects, potential barriers, and disparities in how
healthcare systems provide healthcare to people with ADRD, as these patients may be less capable of describing
their symptoms and health histories, or following through on medical recommendations, and they may rely
substantially on formal and informal caregivers in navigating healthcare services. We seek to understand and
improve healthcare decision-making and outcomes for patients with these complex needs.
The Program’s component research projects address influences on healthcare decisions, and their impact on
outcomes and disparities, across a set of health conditions and settings. We deploy innovative machine learning
methods both to characterize patients’ needs and treatment patterns and to build tools that can assist physicians
with patient diagnostics, even when patients’ communication of their symptoms and health histories may be
limited. We examine the factors that affect both provider and patient decision-making, including pressured
decision-making environments such as Emergency Departments, patient-provider race, administrative burdens
on patients and caregivers such as complex insurance rules, provider incentives, and providers’ patient caseload
and fatigue in influencing healthcare delivery and health outcomes for patients with ADRD. Integrative support
for the Program Project is advanced through three cores that provide common infrastructure, data, and expertise
needed by the projects, and to ensure that they work synergistically and seamlessly as a cohesive program."
10935951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although proteases are widely known to be involved in disease pathophysiology, a consequential
challenge in protease drug discovery is to design or isolate a specific ligand that selectively inhibits or activates
a target protease to remediate disease states and facilitate mechanistic investigations. However, besides well-
studied enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and HIV protease, developing drugs for new
protease targets has proven an iterative, arduous, and often unsuccessful process. Recognizing that the
property of a ligand ultimately dictates its modulatory function and binding mechanism, the proposed research
postulates two hypotheses. First, if molecules are selected directly based on their modulatory function from
large libraries, their properties will directly relate to their function, rather than their binding capabilities. Second,
if the binding mechanism a modulator is determined, functional relationships between ligand properties and
mechanism can be developed and possibly extended these findings to related proteases. The proposed
research pursues three directions, with an overall objective to transform protease ligand discovery and
protease biochemistry from iterative endeavors to data-driven, and ultimately predictive processes. The first
research direction will establish a machine learning (ML)-guided high-throughput screening platform that
isolates protein-based protease modulators directly based on how they alter protease function. Here, property-
function relationships will train machine learning algorithms for function prediction and ML-guided library design
will significantly reduce the search space for protease modulators while exploring distal regulation diversity
more comprehensively. In a second research direction, this platform will be extended to isolate nanobody-
based substrate selective modulators of β-secretase and insulin-degrading enzyme, two proteases that are key
therapeutic targets in Alzheimer’s disease and Type-2-Diabetes, respectively. The ability to finely reprogram
the substrate selectivity of proteases can revolutionize how to study and drug polyspecific enzymes and lead to
successfully targeting previously undruggable proteases. The third research direction will implement deep
mutational scanning protocols to map the modulatory landscape of proteases and determine how modulators
alter protease substrate preference at the molecular and physiological scale. This approach will identify
conformational epitopes of modulators, characterize novel distal sites, and uncover long-range distal
communication. Taken together, the long-term payoff of these studies is to establish generalizable ligand
design guidelines based on ternary relationships between ligand property, binding mechanism/protease
structure and modulatory function, enabling one to better understand how proteases work and how to control
them. The vast experience of the Denard research lab in high-throughput protease engineering and support
from a machine learning expert and neuroscience expert, respectively, strongly supports the feasibility,
success, and sustainability of this multidisciplinary, and potentially broadly impactful independent program."
10935952,"Abstract
Multiplexed spatial profiling of protein markers in cells and tissues is critical to basic research and clinical
applications. Unfortunately, we currently lack tools that can rapidly and routinely profile a large number of proteins
in situ in large tissues with subcellular resolution in a time and cost-effective fashion. Existing tools for in situ
protein analysis including immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence suffer from low multiplexing because
of limited separation of spectral channels. Recent single-cell sequencing methods lack the critical spatial context
needed to understand complex heterogeneous samples. Other spatial proteomics methods that are based on
serial labeling and imaging, indirect indexed mass spectrometry or sequencing are complicated, time-consuming
and expensive. This proposed project will develop a new spatial proteomics technology termed as Phasor S-
FLIM that enables direct, simultaneous, high-plex spatial profiling of protein markers in large and thick tissues
with just one-round of staining and imaging. Our Phasor S-FLIM system, for the first time, allows true parallel,
simultaneous lifetime and spectral detection with phasor analysis to obtain fast, unbiased, high-precision lifetime
and spectral data that can be processed in real time. In the proposed work, we will adapt and further develop
Phasor S-FLIM for high-plex spatial proteomics applications, including (a) implementation of Pulsed Interleaved
Excitation (PIE) dual excitation with 2-photon lasers and sensitive multi-channel GaAsP PMT arrays, enabling
exciting and detecting a broad range of fluorophores (Aim 1), (b) development of a novel fluorophore-quencher
labeling strategy to generate a large repertoire of probes with orthogonal lifetime and spectrum signatures for
high-plex target encoding (Aim 2), and (c) characterization, validation and benchmarking of Phasor S-FLIM for
multiplexed spatial protein analysis using broadly relevant biological and clinical tissue models (Aim 3). Once
developed, we expect the Phasor S-FLIM can detect at least 30 different protein targets through direct, one
round of staining and imaging, in thick (>0.5 mm) tissues, with subcellular resolution (200 nm), and in high
imaging throughput (1 x 1 mm2 plane in <15 min), which is currently not possible with existing methods. Upon
successful completion of the proposed work, we will have established a working prototype ready to quickly serve
the scientific community to address a broad range of biological and clinical questions that are previously
impossible or impractical. Our technology can potentially shift current practice in interrogating protein and cellular
processes as well as the complexity and systems in biology and disease with high resolution, throughput and
scale."
10942534,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HSV–1 infection in neurons remains a mystery. Acute infection in non-neurons is straightforward: the virus
completes its entire life cycle in less than 20 hours with approximately 90 genes encoded. In neurons, the virus
may establish a dormant state of infection, where the robust viral gene expression turns off with only a few
exceptions. Clinically, the HSV–1 reactivation is associated with a variety of neuropathic complications, causing
considerable economic/health burdens.
Our studies suggested that thyroid hormone (TH or T3) played a role in the regulation of HSV–1 replication in
neurons. This hypothesis was supported by our epidemiology data, which shows that patients taking
levothyroxine demonstrated a lower chance of herpes zoster. We presented convincing data indicating that the
TH exerted its effect by binding to its nuclear receptor TR, and the liganded TR occupied the critical HSV–1
regulatory sequences to suppress the viral gene expression and replication. In addition, our publications reveal
for the first time that the latent DRG neurons exhibited much higher sodium channel activity, and that these
neurons with extremely higher excitability are suppressive to viral replication. These observations lead to the
hypothesis that “TH regulates HSV–1 neuronal replication by dual mechanisms: direct binding to the HSV–1 key
regulatory sequences via its nuclear receptor and modulations of neuronal excitability.”
In this proposal, we will first characterize the thyroid hormone-mediated regulation of HSV–1 replication in
neurons during latency and reactivation using computer-guided mutagenesis to generate chimeric virus
by a synthetic genome method. We hypothesize that a critical single nucleotide change within the thyroid
hormone receptor element (TRE) of an important HSV-1 regulatory sequence will disrupt the TH-mediated
epigenetic regulation and control the viral latency and reactivation.
Next, we will determine the impact of thyroid hormone on the functional expression and activity of
voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) during HSV–1 latency and reactivation. We will first verify whether
TH increases Na+ channel function through upregulation of growth factors via MAPK/ERK signaling. We will next
use TH or antagonists to monitor the degrees of latency and reactivation. We hypothesize that TH antagonists
will increase HSV–1 reactivation from latently infected mice. To test the hypothesis, we will determine the effects
of TH on the cytokine production in regulating the VGSC activity via modulating signaling pathways or
intracellular trafficking.
Finally, we will respond to the RFA and design a novel enrichment academy to promote DEIA at UMES for
URM students focusing on AAV gene delivery into neurons to investigate HSV–1 latency and other
diseases. UMES has been emphasizing DEIA since its beginning 137 years ago, and we are proud to be
recognized with an NIH R25 Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) and a five-year HHMI Driving Change
(DC) Award to promote STEM research/education for underrepresented college students. We will build a
coherent program focusing on virology and AAV gene delivery. We will first strengthen our SEPA virology
workshop for high-school students. We will next develop a curriculum for students to manufacture gene delivery
vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAVs) in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh via the NIH
BRAIN initiative. We will finally apply the knowledge we learn to design AAV overexpressing dominant negative
TR for our HSV–1 studies. We anticipate the SEPA and HHMI DC will become feeder/pipeline programs so that
well-prepared students will receive graduate education and conduct research.
In summary, we seek to characterize the mechanism of HSV–1 latency/reactivation regulated by thyroid
hormone. The results will generate invaluable information pertaining to how viruses and the host neurons
accomplish an armistice to establish latency. We will also design an innovative program developing URM
students to make them knowledgeable and competitive in sciences, particularly in virology."
10943434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension (HTN) is the most common risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and causes multiple
health problems including stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, and death. Resistant HTN
is defined by failure to reach blood pressure (BP) goal despite the use of 3 or more HTN medications. Among
the most challenging populations with resistant HTN to treat are persons with renal artery stenosis (RAS) since
HTN treatment in RAS often causes changes in creatinine (Cr). Furthermore, these individuals have extremely
high CVD risk, so achieving BP control is especially important. A major challenge that impairs HTN treatment is
the perception of worsening kidney function or acute kidney injury (AKI) based on creatinine (Cr) changes
during HTN treatment. Blood pressure lowering is often accompanied by changes in Cr, which in turn, typically
leads to interruption or cessation of effective HTN medications; this clinical response is harmful to patients
because these elevations in Cr are typically caused by benign accommodations to hemodynamic changes
rather than acute kidney injury (AKI). The goal of this proposal is to develop a better kidney health monitoring
system, a urine-based kidney tubule health panel (KTHP), that can adjudicate AKI vs. benign Cr changes
during HTN treatment, and thus address a critical unmet need. In Aim 1, we will determine whether KTHP
biomarkers predict the magnitude of BP lowering during treatment with a comprehensive and structured BP
lowering intervention. In Aim 2, we will determine if the magnitude of BP lowering is associated with changes in
KTHP markers at 1-year; and, we will evaluate associations of decreases in eGFR with the changes in the
intrinsic kidney damage markers (KTHP) at 1-year. These studies will provide critical insights into the
comparative utility of KTHP biomarkers vs. creatinine during BP lowering. In Aim 3, we will evaluate
associations of both baseline and changes in 1-year KTHP with CVD events. These Aims will be accomplished
by utilizing the rich and detailed clinical phenotyping of the Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic
Lesions (CORAL) trial, including adjudicated clinical events. The CORAL trial biospecimen bank has baseline
and 1 year urine specimens that will allow for KTHP biomarker assessment. The methods in this proposal will
build on our prior work in the SPRINT trial and will validate the KTHP biomarkers in a high-risk HTN cohort with
frequent changes in Cr during BP lowering treatment. Together, these studies will provide detailed
investigation of urine KTHP biomarkers for monitoring during treatment of resistant HTN. Overall, we aim to
improve or replace the current Cr-based kidney health monitoring system, and to prove the accuracy and utility
of the proposed KTHP biomarkers for monitoring during both resistant and general HTN treatment."
10943469,"Kidney stones remain an enigmatic disease despite decades of work by many investigators with no real
advancement in calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone treatment for more than 20 years, beyond the focus on lowering
urinary supersaturation with respect to CaOx crystals. While the recurrence rate can be reduced, the disease
cannot be cured with current therapies. With prevalence of approximately 10% in most developed countries and
increasing in recent years, research that could define the mechanisms underlying stone formation is increasingly
relevant. Organic materials (mainly proteins) appear to coat all crystal surfaces in CaOx stones, and the presence
of proteins appears to be critical to stone formation. These protein crystal aggregates form spontaneously (self-
assemble) to form dense solid objects with substantial mechanical strength. No single protein is critical to this
process. We have focused for many years on mixtures of strong polyanions (PA) with strong polycations (PC),
which self aggregate at low concentrations and induce CaOx crystal aggregation when mixed in roughly equal
proportions. Direct measurements of protein compositions in stone matrix have demonstrated enrichment of PA
and PC in stones, but also demonstrated a major fraction of many weakly ionic proteins that exhibit preferential
adsorption to stone matrix compared to urine. Unfortunately, the sheer number of proteins comprising stone
matrix obscures the nature of their role in stone formation, yet these broadly constituted mixtures clearly yield
hard, dense aggregates when mixed with CaOx crystals. The protein mixtures found in other kidney stone types
are similar in most proteins, and other mineralized tissues, like human bone and mollusk shells, contain similarly
broad protein mixtures with many common features. Furthermore, studies of PA/PC mixtures in polymer science
show that these systems phase separate (aggregate), but don't achieve the dense solid concentrations of
polymers observed in stones. We hypothesize that CaOx stone formation is dependent on a complex
mixture of proteins, including strongly anionic, strongly cationic, and weakly charged proteins that
interact with CaOx crystals to produce the dense protein-crystal aggregates (composites) with high
mechanical strength that are kidney stones. We will use the established protein compositions of CaOx stone
matrix as a starting point for making controlled mixtures of well characterized polymers and proteins and studying
their interactions with CaOx crystals to understand the self-assembly of stone like composites, as well as their
mechanical properties. Our study team is ideally suited to this task, including a clinician with polymer physical
chemistry training and kidney stone experience and an expert in chemical engineering and polyelectrolyte phase
behavior. The proposed work includes 3 Specific Aims. 1: Test a range of protein/polymer compositions for
their ability to alter CaOx crystallization processes (nucleation, growth, and aggregation). 2: Measure the
mechanical strength of CaOx crystal aggregates spontaneously formed with these mixtures. 3: Prepare
macroscopic composites (simulated stones) for mechanical testing to bridge understanding to clinical disease."
10939647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Our recent work identifying C. acnes-induced T cell extracellular traps (TETs) employed novel
technologies and in-so-doing made several critical observations, that C. acnes phylotypes can drive the
differentiation of TH17 cell into either antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial TH17 cells. In turn, antimicrobial TH17
cells release TETs that entangle and kill bacteria. These observations, along with supporting publications,
leads directly to this proposal.
 Importantly, while this proposal has major implications in improving our understanding of T cell-microbe
interactions, it is purposefully designed to interrogate the mechanisms by which C. acnes phylotypes activate T
cell subsets to release mitochondria-derived extracellular traps (mtETs) both broadly and mechanistically
through innovative translational research as a critical next step. To achieve its goals, this grant builds on ample
preliminary findings of i) confocal live imaging demonstrating a catapult-like release of mtETs independent of T
cell death, and ii) single cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA-seq) showing elevated expression of mitochondrial-
associated genes in T cell subsets from acne lesions but not in nonlesional skin. The mechanisms governing
the induction, release and the role of mtETs in acne are unknown .
Our central hypothesis is that C. acnes-induced T cell extracellular trap formation involves
multiple mechanisms that either ameliorate or potentiate the inflammatory response in acne. To test
this, we will determine the mechanism by which C. acnes induce mtETs release from T cells (Aim 1), and
identify proteins associated with mtETs including their antimicrobial activity against C. acnes (Aim 2). Our
strategy will include: classical immunological techniques involving T cell cloning to dissect the immune effector
functions that underlie T cell-mediated antimicrobial host defense; confocal live imaging to define mechanisms
of mtETs release and mitochondrial dynamics during mtETs formation; Mass spectrometry analysis to
determine protein composition of mtETs and state-of-the-art scRNA-seq experiments to compute mitochondrial
gene signatures and to define the T cell subsets and immune circuits present in acne lesions. This contribution
is critical as, our studies will make significant conceptual advances in understanding how C. acnes phylotypes
shape T cell immune responses in acne skin. The identification of inflammatory and/or antimicrobial proteins
associated with mtETs can ultimately guide the design of new “druggable” host targets to ameliorate
inflammatory acne and other skin diseases caused by dysbiosis."
10943633,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy screening (PGT-A) is now widely used to decrease early
pregnancy loss and to increase pregnancy rates, especially in women with advanced reproductive age.
Despite the improved pregnancy outcomes with PGT-A, the current technology has three major limitations that
limit its clinical value. First, standard PGT-A requires invasive embryo biopsy procedures, which can cause
embryo damage or demise. Second, using the few tested non-fetal cells as a surrogate for the entire embryo,
current PGT-A provides only indirect and often inaccurate diagnosis of fetal chromosomal status and can
falsely predict pregnancy success. Third, an extensive process of embryo culture, freezing, and thawing before
embryo transfer is required, which also causes embryo loss and lowers live birth rates. To overcome these
limitations, this proposal will take the first step in developing a novel live embryo imaging method for
aneuploidy detection with the goal of using the tested whole embryo directly for reproduction. This biopsy-free
aneuploidy screening test (“Live PGT-A”) can provide direct and accurate information on all chromosomes in
the entire embryo at the earliest stage without extensive embryo culture, freezing, and thawing. Integrating
complementary expertise in assisted reproduction, bioengineering, fluorescent single-molecule imaging, and
(epi)genomics, this team will develop Live PGT-A in mouse early embryos and examine its safety and
accuracy in detail during this grant period so it can be tested in human embryos in the future as a clinical
diagnostic tool. Specifically, the following aims are proposed: 1) Develop an all-chromosome live imaging
method in somatic cells; 2) Examine the degradation kinetics of fluorescent ribonucleoprotein (fRNP) in mouse
embryos and demonstrate genomic and transcriptomic integrity in the tested embryos; 3) Test whether Live
PGT-A results in healthy offspring. Once this technology is fully developed and the safety is fully tested in
mouse embryos as proposed, it can be readily extended to determine all chromosomes in human embryos, as
well as in sperm and oocytes. The proposed study is highly significant because this novel Live PGT-A method
has high potentials of significantly improving birth outcomes after assisted reproduction by minimizing embryo
loss and wrong diagnosis and thus could one day replace the current PGT-A practice. The technology
developed here also has a wide range of scientific applications. The ability to trace multiple chromosomes at
once in individual live embryos will provide new insights in many essential biological processes during early
embryo development, and enable direct examination of the impact of various aneuploidy on the growth and
development of the embryo."
10943260,"Autistic people are at increased risk of suicide behaviors (SB), including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts,
and have higher rates of suicide death compared to non-autistic people (use of ‘autistic’ reflects community
language preferences). Yet there is limited understanding of the mutable factors related to risk of SB for the
autistic population. Beyond biological and behavioral traits, research with the general public reveals multiple
social determinants of health (e.g., community-level resources, health policies) contribute to risk of SB.
However, the impact of individual, community, and policy factors on risk of SB in the autistic population is
unknown. Meaningful improvements in policy and practice will require an understanding of (1) how risk of SB
clusters for autistic individuals across interdependent individual, community, and policy factors and (2) the
current state of mental health service (MHS) provision among autistic people.
To contribute to the long-term goal of reducing risk of SB for the autistic population, this project uses a
sequential, mixed methods design, in collaboration with an established team of autistic stakeholders and policy
and practice experts, to analyze multilevel, socioecological factors associated with risk of SB and receipt of
MHS and to generate community-supported recommendations for suicide prevention. Aim 1 will identify
clusters of socioecological factors (at individual, community, and policy levels) associated with risk of SB
among two national samples of autistic youth and adults. Autistic people (aged 12-64) will be identified in two
national healthcare claims databases (MarketScan private, CMS Medicaid) and integrated with public use and
proprietary databases to create multilevel, longitudinal datasets containing individual, community, and policy
factors. Data reduction, hierarchical clustering, and multilevel analytic techniques will partition individuals into
homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics to identify underlying factors associated with risk of SB
among autistic people. Next, using the databases developed in Aim 1, Aim 2 will evaluate socioecological
factors associated with MHS receipt (psychotherapy, pharmacology, both, neither), dose (visits/year), and
delivery modality (face-to-face, telemental health, both) for autistic people with documented SB and/or co-
occurring mental health conditions. Informed by critical findings from Aims 1 and 2, through collaboration with
autistic stakeholders and focus groups with additional autistic adults, family caregivers, and MHS clinicians,
Aim 3 will establish community-supported recommendations to reduce risk of SB and facilitate receipt of MHS.
In response to RFA PAR-23-095 and aligned with the NIMH strategic plan, this project will optimize real-world
data collection systems to characterize clusters of multilevel risk factors of SB and factors associated with
receipt of MHS among autistic people. Study results will produce translatable, community-informed evidence
and recommendations aimed at reducing risk of SB and improving MHS delivery for autistic people."
10942118,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. VTE is caused by acquired and
genetic factors, but the genetic factors that modify the risk for VTE are not fully understood. Coagulation
factors play a major role in VTE, but the regulation of coagulation factor expression in the liver is not well
characterized. Our long-term goal is to dissect the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate
hepatocyte expression of coagulation factors. Our strategy is to use genome wide association studies (GWAS)
to identify novel candidate genes that are linked to VTE risk. A recent GWAS identified the BCL6 co-repressor
(BCOR) locus as a risk for VTE in humans. The objective of this grant is to characterize the role of BCOR in
epigenetic regulation of Factor VII and thrombosis. Our Preliminary Data show that (1) BCOR controls Factor
VII expression in cells and mice, and (2) BCOR associates with two epigenetic modules: the Polycomb
Repressor Complex (PRC1.1), and the Ada2a-containing complex (ATAC). Our central hypothesis is that
BCOR suppresses Factor VII expression through the epigenetic regulators PRC1.1 and ATAC. Our rationale is
that identification of epigenetic pathways that control coagulation may lead to new specific therapies to prevent
or treat VTE. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (1) BCOR suppresses Factor VII expression
in hepatocytes by controlling the epigenetic modules PRC1.1 and ATAC. (2) The genetic variant in the BCOR
locus linked to VTE risk decreases BCOR expression by controlling TEAD1 binding to the BCOR enhancer
(where TEAD1 Is a TEA domain family member suppressor protein). (3) Inhibition of hepatic BCOR expression
increases Factor VII levels and increases coagulation and thrombosis in vivo. Upon conclusion of this project,
we will understand how human genetic variants in the BOCR locus contributes to risk of VTE. The significance
of our studies is that we will establish epigenetic regulation as a pathway to control Factor VII levels, possibly
leading to novel therapies for VTE by targeting specific epigenetic pathways. The innovation of our studies is:
(A) BCOR has not been previously linked to VTE; (B) BCOR has not been shown to interact with the ATAC
epigenetic complex; (C) epigenetic regulation of liver production of coagulation factors is not well
characterized. In summary: human genetics suggests BCOR modulates the risk of VTE, our animal model
shows that BCOR in the liver affects plasma Factor VII levels and coagulation in vivo, our cell studies show
that BCOR associates with epigenetic regulators and modulates expression of Factor VII in vitro. We now
propose to study the epigenetic mechanisms by which BCOR in the liver regulates coagulation."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) research represents a major national investment. ADRD
clinical research faces delays and risks to internal and external validity resulting from challenges to efficient
accrual, especially inadequate inclusion of populations at increased risk for disease due to social determinants
of health. Recruitment registries are tools to accelerate accrual in ADRD research. Registries are repositories of
potentially eligible individuals who have consented to be contacted about studies, reducing the need for serial
recruitment by enabling bolus enrollment of ready cohorts. Few data address essential questions about registry
design, conduct, and effectiveness in aiding ADRD research recruitment. How best to recruit and retain
participants to registries and whether registries can address the urgent need to diversify clinical research
samples are unknown. Furthermore, how registry samples compare to other research populations has not been
investigated. This proposal investigates traditional and modern approaches to registry recruitment and asks
critical questions about inclusion of participants from underserved neighborhoods and registrant retention. Given
that registries are, by definition, convenience samples, we also aim to quantify the bias associated with these
recruitment tools and develop methodology for addressing this bias. This project will produce essential
information about resource utilization in recruitment registries and provide critical guidance for the field about
how best to use these important tools."
10941837,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The three-dimensional (3D) genome folding organization within the nucleus of cells plays a key role in
epigenomic regulation in both normal physiology and disease. Sequencing-based 3D genomics technologies –
such as high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) – have reported systematically altered
genome organization in cancer cells. Yet, these studies relied on population averaging of cells and indirect
inference of genome organization based on chromatin contacts. As a result, how the genome is folded in true
3D in individual cancer cells in vivo, how this folding organization evolves and is regulated during cancer
progression from normal to preinvasive to invasive tumor cells within the native tissue environment, and how
alterations in genome organization drive tumorigenesis remain elusive. To address these gaps in knowledge,
we applied an image-based 3D genomics method that we pioneered termed chromatin tracing to a faithful Kras-
driven mouse model (K-MADM-Trp53) of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and developed the first in situ single-cell
3D genome atlas of any cancer. We observed stereotypical 3D genome alterations during cancer development,
including a striking structural bottleneck in preinvasive adenomas prior to progression to LUAD, indicating a
stringent selection on the 3D genome early in tumorigenesis. We further found that 3D genome organization
correlates with distinct histologic cancer states in single cells and shifts in this organization reveal potential
drivers of LUAD progression. In this proposal, we aim to test the hypothesis that changes in the 3D organization
of the cancer genome drive tumorigenesis. The studies in Aim 1 utilize a sophisticated multiplexed in vivo
CRISPR knockout screen to establish the functional importance of 3D genome-regulated candidate driver genes
in LUAD progression and confirm that similar alterations occur in human LUAD biospecimens. The proposed
work in Aim 2 uses genetic and pharmacologic manipulation and epigenetic profiling methods (ChIP, CUT&RUN,
chromatin tracing) in LUAD cells and mouse models to define how the chromatin-modifying enzyme Rnf2
regulates the cancer 3D genome through a non-canonical function in promoting an active chromatin state.
Finally, the experiments in Aim 3 leverage analogous autochthonous mouse models of EGFR-driven LUAD and
Kras-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to determine how oncogenic driver (Kras vs. EGFR) and tissue
of origin (lung vs. pancreas) impact the 3D genome and resultant effects on tumor biology. Together, these
experiments will establish how alterations in the 3D genome – as assessed by in situ chromatin tracing – drive
context-dependent cancer development, the underlying mechanisms that promote their pro-tumorigenic effects,
and their capacity to serve as novel predictive biomarkers for cancer therapy."
10942634,"Health disparity populations are more likely to face barriers to immunization in traditional medical settings.
Specifically, people from minoritized racial/ethnic groups, residents of underserved rural areas, and
households with less advantaged socio-economic status are more likely to lack a primary care medical home,
report logistical challenges accessing medical offices (e.g., lack of transportation, clinic hours, long wait times),
and live in areas with poor access to primary care. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, school-located
vaccination (SLV) had been successfully used for routine and pandemic (H1N1) vaccines to overcome some of
these access barriers. SLV can occur through School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) or School-Located
Vaccine Clinics (SLVCs). SLVCs are time-limited events focused on the mass delivery of one or more
vaccines. They can be led by a school nurse, coordinated through an SBHC, if available, or conducted in
partnership with local health systems or health departments. As only 13% of public school students in the
United States had access to an SBHC in the 2016-17 school year, SLVCs play an important role in extending
the reach of SLV. Recently, schools gained substantial experience with SLVCs due to the urgency of the
pediatric COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. Because most SBHCs are located in urban, low-income, and
racially/ethnically minoritized communities and SLVCs typically provide vaccines free of cost to all students
regardless of insurance status, they are often assumed to improve health equity. However, there have been no
systematic investigations of the full scope of SLV models (SBHCs, SLVCs independent of an SBHC, and
SLVCs run by SBHCs) to determine whether locating vaccination services in schools increases immunization
rates in health disparity populations. To fill this critical gap, this study will apply quasi-experimental methods,
microsimulation modeling, and a modified positive deviance approach grounded in implementation science to
examine the impact of the three models of SLV (SBHCs, SLVCs, and both) on routine, influenza, and COVID-
19 vaccination rates among school-aged children in Colorado, overall and for health disparity populations. We
aim to: (1) Describe SLV models (SBHCs, SLVCs, and both) in Colorado from 2018-2024, the local context in
which they were implemented, and how model and school characteristics changed over time; (2) Estimate
causal impacts of SLV models on routine, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccine uptake among school-aged
children (5-17 years) from 2018-2024; (3) Simulate potential local- and state-level impacts of SLVCs on
routine, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccine coverage among all students in Colorado and members of health
disparity populations; and (4) Qualitatively investigate contextual barriers to and facilitators of recent SLV
implementation in Colorado. Study findings will be immediately actionable for SLV implementers and
policymakers seeking to reduce vaccination disparities among school-aged children and adolescents."
10946992,"Abstract – Integrated Technologies Core 
The overall goal of the Integrated Technologies Core (ITC) is to provide coordinated access and cost-effective 
support for our facility – the Center for Biomolecular Structure (CBMS). 
The first role of the ITC is to enable technical and engineering support for three Technology Operations Cores. 
The first two are the ones that depend on hard-x-ray diffraction – the two Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) 
beamlines: Frontier Microfocusing Macromolecular Crystallography (FMX), and Highly Automated 
Macromolecular Crystallography (AMX), and on scattering – Life Science X-ray Scattering (LiX), in structural 
biological studies. Constructed predominantly with an award from the NIH, these three beamlines support 
structural biology and other disciplines, and the funding in this grant will support their operation. The third core 
supported through the ITC is the X-ray Footprinting Core (XFP). The XFP is a partner beamline constructed by 
Case Western Reserve University. It participated in our Operations and ITC meetings in the first grant cycle and 
joins the CBMS resource now. In the first grant cycle of the CBMS, the five imaging beamlines, built and operated 
mostly by DOE Basic Energy Sciences, and that provide access for life-science studies, were supported through 
a third technical core, the Imaging core. That core is not part of this proposal for P30 funding. Within the P30- 
driven operational support in this part of the grant, we will provide coordinated access to imaging facilities that 
integrate the research of the life-science user community, where a user’s experimental plan includes a possible 
use of the imaging facilities. 
The second role of the ITC is to coordinate standards for hardware, software, controls, and networking and 
computing systems. It also assures resource sharing among all technology operations cores in CBMS and 
supports efficient communication with the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) beamlines and the 
technical and engineering groups. A third role of the ITC is supporting our computing facilities: coordinating 
standards for hardware, software, controls, and networking and computing systems. 
We believe that by organizing our technical staff to function across the four beamlines, we will make better use 
of our resources. We estimate that our collaboration saves personnel resources equivalent to two to three FTE. 
By pooling spare parts, and assuming equipment failures to be random, for four beamlines the reduction in 
investment in spares amounts to approximately 40%. This will allow us to provide backup coverage and extra 
support among the beamlines, to be consistent in instrument design, and to make efficient use of accepted 
facilities-maintenance standards. Numerous resources within the ITC exist also in the rest of the NSLS-II; for us 
to share and exchange knowledge and apparatus will cross-fertilize opportunities for all of us and foster greater 
efficiency."
10942200,"Functional and molecular characterization of Oncofetal Stem Cells in CRC
Project Summary.
Background. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly cancer worldwide, with nearly one million
deaths annually1. CRC develops as a result of accumulating genetic and epigenetic aberrations in the colonic
epithelium leading to formation of benign adenomas that evolve to invasive adenocarcinomas 2,3. Despite the
advances in treatment options, resistance to therapy and recurrence remain inevitable in patients with advanced
disease, accounting for the high mortality rates 4,5. The underlying malignant features have been often attributed
to the LGR5+ CSCs. However, the unexpected findings that certain LGR5- cells sustain tumor growth upon
selective ablation of this population 6,7 are consistent with the recent description of a potential second stem cell
population, with fetal-like characteristics 8-10. While this is intriguing from a therapeutic perspective, existence of
a second, plastic, stem cell population in a more primitive state (hereafter referred to as OnFSCs for OncoFetal
Stem Cells) is solely based on transcriptional signatures.
Gap. Despite recent studies describing its existence, the molecular underpinnings, functional relevance, and
therapeutic implications of the OnF cellular state in CRC remain largely unexplored.
 Hypothesis. We hypothesize that OnFSCs work in tandem with the LGR5+ stem cells (SCs) to fuel tumor
evolution in CRC. OnF cells emerge early during intestinal tumorigenesis (i.e. upon inactivation of the APC
gatekeeper). Their resistance to therapy and high regenerative potential makes them a critical driver of tumor
plasticity and cancer recurrence.
 Specific Aims. We here propose to functionally characterize the OnFSCs in CRC.
In Aim1, we will first generate phenotypic transcriptional reporters to track the dynamics of the LGR5+ CSCs and
OnFSCs. Then, by coupling these reporters to a suicide gene (i.e. DTR), we aim to dissect the functional interplay
between these different stem cell pools in CRC.
In Aim2, we will use a multi-omic approach to determine the molecular drivers of the OnF state and phenotypic
plasticity in CRC.
In Aim3 we will perform targeted phenotypic screening to identify compounds able to selectively deplete
OnFSCs. The top hits will be tested in combination with the current standard of care or LGR5+SC-targeting
therapies11,12. We will validate our top drug combinations in vivo using both mouse tumoroids and human PDOs
and/or PDXs. The aim is to determine a selective combination therapy superior to the current standard of care.
 Impact. The findings of these studies will uncover a new layer of complexity in CRC biology and will establish
a mechanistic foundation for designing effective combination therapies with enduring impact on CRC treatment."
10906673,"PROJECT SUMMARY
β-Lactamases are the most widespread resistance mechanism to β-lactam antibiotics. Of particular
concern are a group of β-lactamases known as carbapenemases, named for their ability to destroy
our newest β-lactam antibiotics, the carbapenems. The rise of carbapenem resistance is a recent
global trend that has resulted in pan-national fear. An interesting approach to understand
carbapenem resistance and how it evolves is through quantitative analysis of non-pathogenic
microorganisms found in the environment. Analysis of these microorganisms offers the intriguing
possibility of predicting how antibiotic resistance may evolve and provides clinicians with an
“early warning” system for the advent of novel resistance mechanisms in pathogenic bacteria.
Previous research has shown that the soil is an excellent repository for many β-lactamases,
especially carbapenemases. The main part of the project will be the study of a collection of
metagenome-origin β-lactamases isolated from Alaskan soil, named LRA (for “β-lactam resistance
from Alaska”). This metagenomic approach will be expanded and applied to the analysis of soil
samples from Antarctica to identify β-lactamase-mediated resistance in different isolated regions.
Identified environmental β-lactamases will be characterized using a multi-pronged approach
involving phenotypic, molecular, biochemical and structural techniques. Specifically, results from
this comprehensive analysis will allow us to assess the evolutionary routes of β-lactamases found
among clinical pathogens that plague human health today, and to evaluate novel niches of
potentially unexplored genes that could be recruited by these pathogens."
10904202,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Neuromodulatory signaling is thought to play key roles in regulating the activity of local and long-range circuits
in the brain and in mediating behavioral state-dependent changes in circuit function and cognition. Despite
extensive anatomical evidence, there is little functional data on neuromodulatory signaling across the cortex
during behavior. Recent work has highlighted the complex, state-dependent spatiotemporal pattern of
acetylcholine (ACh) release in the neocortex. In contrast, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of
norepinephrine (NE) signaling. Previous work has suggested that fluctuations in cholinergic and noradrenergic
signals may occur in tight coordination, particularly at moments of transition between behavioral states such as
quiescence and arousal. However, technical limitations have precluded simultaneous observation of multiple
neuromodulatory systems. To address these gaps, we propose to combine novel imaging approaches, including
multicolor wide-field `mesoscopic' imaging of neuronal, NE, and ACh signaling across the entire cortex in awake
behaving animals, with high-density electrophysiology and pharmacological manipulations. Using this
combination of imaging and electrophysiology, we will test the following hypotheses: (1) Noradrenergic signaling
regulates cortical activity at key transitions between behavioral states. (2) Noradrenergic and cholinergic
signaling patterns exhibit selective spatiotemporal coordination. Our results will provide an unprecedented level
of insight into the relationship between noradrenergic signaling and neocortical activity and provide novel data
on coordination between neuromodulatory systems."
10906070,"TITLE: Readthrough of disease-causing nonsense mutations by targeted selenocysteine recoding
PROJECT SUMMARY
Nonsense (stop) mutations comprise about 10% of disease-causing mutations, and are common in Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. These mutations cause early termination of translation and lead
to non-functional proteins. Therapies that enable readthrough of these premature termination codons have been
sought for many years with limited success. Existing approaches are limited by lack of specificity, low efficiency,
or the need to deliver small genes.
The amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), sometimes known as the 21st amino acid, is incorporated into human
proteins via recoding of opal (UGA) stop codons. This recoding mechanism is activated by the presence of a
Sec incorporation sequence element (SECIS) in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR). This element was shown to
be sufficient to stimulate selenocysteine incorporation and is active even when located far from the UGA codon.
Here we will develop a novel approach for inducing readthrough of opal nonsense mutations through Sec
recoding. This will be achieved through the use of short hybridizing oligonucleotides that bring the targeted
mRNA in proximity to a SECIS element, inducing readthrough in a gene-specific manner, and restoring a
functional protein. In Aim 1, we will screen oligonucleotides that hybridize to both the target mRNA and an
endogenous SECIS-containing transcript. In Aim 2, we will develop a high-throughput cell sorting-based assay,
allowing the identification of optimal oligonucleotides among the combinatorially large number of possible
designs. We will screen multiple possible designs, including oligonucleotides containing a hybridizing part and a
(possibly abbreviated) SECIS element. We will demonstrate our approach using two disease-associated genes
(DMD and CFTR) and validate the identified oligonucleotides in disease cell models.
The proposed approach has several important advantages over currently available therapeutic approaches to
nonsense mutations. First, the oligonucleotides are specific to the targeted gene, reducing concerns of off-target
effects. Second, the same oligonucleotide can potentially be used for any nonsense mutation in the same gene,
reducing development cost and addressing patients with very rare mutations. Finally, safe and efficient delivery
of short oligonucleotides to several tissues has already been demonstrated. Together, the specificity, broad
usability, and use of proven delivery technologies, make our approach particularly attractive for therapeutic
purposes.
Aligned with NIBIB’s interests, this project will develop a platform technology that is applicable to a broad
spectrum of disorders and diseases. If successful, the project will have a tremendous impact on the quality of
life of people suffering from genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations and from cancer."
10906354,"ABSTRACT
 The primary goal of this project is to further our understanding of the contribution of the vestibular system
to balance control, particularly the neural mechanisms driving reflexive responses to postural perturbations.
Visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular signals are the primary means for sensing the position of the body and
maintaining balance. However, the central neural mechanisms of postural control remain elusive, as such
research requires recording single neurons in the brainstem during free behavior. In order to understand the
vestibular component of central postural control, I will first establish baseline postural responses in an animal
model, the rhesus macaque, which has proven to be a valuable model for understanding the neural control of
human vestibular function and processing. I will then characterize behavioral and neural responses during these
posture-stabilizing behaviors in healthy animals, bilateral vestibular loss animals, and vestibular loss animals
with replacement-of-function using a vestibular prosthesis. Aim 1 of this project is to characterize behavioral
responses to support surface perturbations. For postural perturbation experiments, the animal is acclimated to
a behavioral chamber mounted on a 6-degree-of-freedom hexapod motion platform. The hexapod delivers
support surface perturbations, and the animal’s motion is tracked using inertial measurement units, a force plate,
and markerless video motion tracking. These perturbations are repeated in normal and bilateral vestibular loss
animals, and the animals’ postural responses are quantified in order to build a model of the vestibular contribution
to balance control. Aim 2 is to characterize responses of vestibular-sensitive neurons that drive postural reflexes
to support surface perturbations. I will leverage emerging technology in wireless, high-density neural recording
to characterize the responses of neurons in the vestibular nuclei (VN) to postural perturbations in order to
elucidate the contribution of vestibulo-spinal reflexes, which are driven by VN cells, to postural corrections.
Finally, for Aim 3 I will repeat these experiments and recordings with an animal fitted with a multichannel
vestibular prosthesis in order to assess improvements in posture caused by the vestibular prosthesis, as well as
neural adaptation to novel and/or modified vestibular inputs delivered by the prosthesis. This work has the
potential to contribute to our understanding of the role of vestibuloception in maintaining upright posture, as well
as improve quality-of-life for patients experiencing bilateral vestibular loss by providing data on the best
modulation strategies for vestibular prostheses."
10941818,"Abstract
Natural products are non-essential small organic molecules produced by living organisms, such as bacteria,
fungi, plants, and animals. They have been described as the most important structural leads within the
pharmaceutical industry, and current estimates suggest that 50–70% of medicines can be traced back to a
natural product origin, including more than 60% of the anticancer drugs brought to market in the last 25 years.
One of the first major hurdles in any drug development program involves an initial “hit identification”, a process
commonly accomplished through large-scale screening programs. Consequently, establishing a new natural
product-driven approach to drug-lead identification has the potential to markedly improve the efficiency of the
drug development process. To this end, herein we introduce a new strategy that attempts to shift the burden of
hit identification from Scientist to Nature. Specifically, we propose that instances of “convergent evolution” in
natural product biosynthesis may be a marker for molecules of significant biological importance given they have
survived the natural selection process on more than one occasion. Selection of our targets, the halenaquinones,
viridins, wortmannins, and hibiscones, was guided by a combination of biosynthetic considerations and
preestablished anticancer activities. We have already developed an innovative and scalable route to many of
halenaquinone family members. Our approach takes advantage of the inherent reactivity present within these
molecules, and when considered alongside the simple nature of the reagents employed and the structure of the
various coisolates, we believe this to be in support of our biosynthetic speculation. We have already
demonstrated our approach is directly applicable to the synthesis of simplified analogues, and we envision it will
translate to our remaining natural product families. The first exhaustive SAR studies, done in combination with
computational and experimental docking studies, will inform the development of new anti-cancer drug leads and
simplified chemical probes. In the long-term, it is envisioned instances of “convergent evolution” in natural
product biosynthesis may develop in to a general approach to drug discovery."
10941872,"Evolution of 3D Genome Folding Mechanisms and Gene Regulatory Strategies in Metazoans
Abstract:
The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate the role that 3D genome folding plays in shaping transcriptional
regulatory strategies in animals. It has been proposed that organisms use multiple mechanisms, notably loop
extrusion and phase separation, to fold nuclear DNA into a variety of structures including compartments and
topologically associating domains (TADs). These features have been shown to have functional consequences
on the transcriptional regulation of genes. As 3D features differ between lineages and have different regulatory
properties, it is likely that changes to 3D folding mechanisms could have profound consequences on the
transcriptional regulation strategies used in distinct lineages. Despite rapid progress, largely driven by
development of chromosomal conformation capture techniques, in identifying the mechanisms of genome folding
in major animal model organisms such as flies, nematodes and mouse, several barriers exist to our broader
understanding of the relationship between evolution of 3D genome folding and evolution of transcriptional
regulatory strategies including 1) 3D genome studies cover only a fraction of the diversity of animal genomes
and many critical transitional lineages are not sampled 2) 3D genome maps generated by HiC represent an
averaged view of the interplay between several co-existing mechanisms, making it challenging to link specific
transcriptional processes to 3D architecture and disentangle their contribution to gene regulation. To overcome
these challenges, we will employ a novel phylogenetic comparative approach using chromatin technologies,
functional genetics and single-cell approaches to 1) generate 3D genome maps in outgroups to the vertebrates
and to the Bilateria using approaches we have established in non-model marine invertebrates 2) functionally
assay the role of chromatin-interacting proteins we have isolated from these lineages to determine the
mechanistic basis of changes to genome folding 3) characterize the transcriptional regulatory strategies used in
these animals via approaches we have developed to study gene regulatory mechanisms. This work will generate
a fuller view of the evolution of 3D genome folding mechanisms in animals and will provide insight into the global
drivers that shape gene regulatory strategies, which ultimately form the basis of changes to body plan complexity
and phenotypic evolution. Furthermore, by contributing to our understanding of the basic mechanisms that
shape 3D genome folding and gene regulation, insight generated through this comparative work will better inform
our understanding of the dysregulation of gene expression that occurs in pathological contexts in humans such
as cancer. The flexibility and perspective of the MIRA is ideally suited to support this integrated, multi-faceted
program whereby rapidly evolving technologies can be readily integrated into the scope of this research program
over the next five years."

10932856,"1 ABSTRACT: The goal of this proposal is to provide technically-advanced support for the specific aims of
 2 selected NCI-funded projects for medical imaging affiliated with the University of Washington (UW), The
 3 University of Pennsylvania, the NCI Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN), and the NCTN ECOG-ACRIN
 4 cooperative group. My medical imaging career began at UW in 1985, where I was fortunate to work with Drs.
 5 Michael Graham and Alex Spence, who laid the foundation for quantitative analysis in oncology. My early work
 6 in PET imaging revolved around managing animal imaging projects, a full biochemistry lab and a nascent
 7 human PET imaging program. As PET imaging developed under NCI grant P01-CA042045 (PI; Krohn, KA),
 8 we transitioned to human imaging and clinical trials research, probing various biochemical pathways using
 9 many PET tracers. I developed avidity for kinetic modeling of dynamic PET image data, initially with Drs.
10 James Bassingwaithe and Michael Graham, and later in collaboration with Drs. Tony Shields, David Mankoff,
11 Janet Eary, Hannah Linden and Paul Kinahan, all of them funded by NCI grants. As an NCI R50 recipient
12 (R50-CA270211), I am currently Director of a Core Laboratory for Advanced image analysis and a member of
13 Dr. Kinahan’s U24 (U24-CA264044) CIRP team. I have responsibility for participating in working groups of the
14 QIN, CIRP, planning PET imaging projects, imaging protocols and designing novel data analysis methods. I
15 am a senior contributor to our UW program as well as a provider of innovative approaches to quantitative
16 image analysis and data simulations for numerous cancer imaging projects. Due to the cost of imaging,
17 radiation dose and other issues, my personal ambition is to extract as much quantitative information as
18 possible from well-designed and executed cancer imaging studies. My career goal is to provide independent,
19 but collaborative, support for the specific aims of NCI grants for medical imaging projects at UW, UPenn, the
20 QIN, CIRP and ECOG-ACRIN. Additionally, I have national recognition as manager of the ECOG-ACRIN-UW
21 PET Core Lab, a member of the ECOG-ACRIN Head & Neck, Experimental Imaging, Radiomics, Quantitative
22 Imaging and Brain Tumor Committees, and a key member of the NCI/CIP QIN Working Groups. The innovative
23 protocols I developed for dynamic imaging are a substantial improvement for extracting quantitative information
24 from dynamic PET, and are now a national clinical trials standard. I routinely present my advanced PET
25 imaging results at national and international scientific meetings (EORTC, SNMMI, WMIC, EMIM, IEEE, ECOG-
26 ACRIN and QIN/NCI) and publish/review manuscripts annually. Over the last R50 period I had 26 publications,
27 6 data reports and 40 presentations. In summary, I have developed a nationally recognized advanced lab for
28 image analysis, funded entirely through NCI grants for 35 years. The overall benefit NCI receives for sharing
29 my labor across NCI projects will have an impact on current and new investigators, providing them with
30 quantitative methods for PET/CT and MRI cancer image data using robust, repeatable and validated methods."

 Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a complication of adenoviral (AdV)-based
COVID-19 vaccination. Antibodies (Abs) against the 70-aa chemokine, platelet (Plt) factor 4 (PF4), have been
noted in both VITT and in the related immune, prothrombotic disorder, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT),
but target different sites on the human (h) PF4 tetramer. The site on hPF4 targeted in VITT is conserved in the
related chemokine, 94-aa -granule, Plt-basic protein (PBP) and its N-terminal-truncated isoforms (PBPi),
including 70-aa neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP2) that uniquely activates neutrophils (PMNs) via CXCR2.
We hypothesize that PF4 and/or PBP can initiate VITT and contribute to its prothrombotic state. We show that
VITT Abs bind hPBPi and activate Plts. Mice injected with VITT plasma develop a prothrombotic state even in
the absence of PF4, and unlike in murine HIT, PMNs become incorporated into arterial as well as venular
thrombi. We also show by dynamic light scattering (DLS) that both chemokines bind directly to AdVs. In a murine
VITT model, Abs develop to either PF4 or PBPi. We will pursue our observation and test the above hypothesis
as follows: Aim 1: Characterize the range of antigenic targets of VITT Abs. We will confirm that VITT Abs,
VITT monoclonal (mo) Abs, and murine Abs generated in Aim 3 bind to hPBPi. We will also determine where
VITT Abs bind on hPBPi using select amino acid substitutions of hPBP. Aim 2: Examine the importance of
hPF4 and hPBPi in VITT in vitro and in vivo. We will test the relative contribution of hPF4 vs. hPBPi to
thrombus formation in vitro using an injured-endothelium microfluidic model. Transgenic FcRIIA+ mice that
express either no PF4 or PBP, or have the murine or human versions, will be injected with VITT Abs to recreate
the prothrombotic state to validate the importance of PF4 vs. PBP in the development of thrombi in vivo. Aim 3:
Examine the mechanistic basis for the onset of VITT in a murine model. We have developed a novel murine
VITT model that suggests that the prothrombotic state occurs after AdV vaccination independent of expressing
the COVID-19 spike protein. Both anti-PF4 and anti-PBPi Abs were noted. These studies were supported by
DLS studies which showed that both chemokines complex with AdV, but that some AdV bind better to hPF4 and
others to hPBPi. The mechanistic basis of VITT will be further pursued, including defining the site(s) by which
these chemokines interact with AdV, and the characterization of the formed Abs. Taken together, Project 3
should provide important, novel conceptual insights into VITT. A number of new VITT-like pro-thrombotic
disorders are being recognized, and our studies should also be applicable to these disorders. Finally, AdV-based
vaccines have been developed for other disorders, and our models in Aim 3 may guide AdV modifications to
enhance vaccine safety. These advances will greatly benefit from synergy between Dr. Poncz and the expertise
provided by shared Core B at Versiti's Blood Research Institute, as well as with the other Project Leaders in our
Program – each studying thematically related, clinically important immune thrombocytopenic disorders."

died, primarily as a result of metastasis. First line treatment involves localized surgical removal of the primary
tumor as systemic therapies are generally reserved for metastatic dissemination. While ccRCC surveillance
protocols have improved over recent years, aggressive management with immunomodulators and
chemotherapeutic agents is generally withheld until after significant recurrence or metastasis is identified;
although this is generally too late to effectively manage or deter advanced cancerous spread, which is reflected
by a post-metastasis 5-year survival rate of just 14%. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to further address the
absence of quantifiable targeted metabolite biomarkers in ccRCC tissues that accurately and specifically
predict early disease progression to metastasis. Ultimately, we seek to identify those patients that express
aggressive subtype(s) of renal cancer that would benefit from earlier initiation of systemic therapy. Likewise,
evaluation of this newly identified 12-marker panel can determine those patients who will have metastatic
disease with 100% specificity and may confidently choose a more conservative management approach.
 There is a clear unmet clinical need to stratify aggressive cancer subpopulations within certain
malignancies like ccRCC, yet, there are currently no prognostic or diagnostic tests on the market that predict
metastasis. In pilot studies, LAGRANGE SCIENTIFIC was able to overcome major problems that encumbered
previous metabolic studies, such as primary tumor tissue heterogeneity and day-to-day, as well as lab-to-lab,
MS variability. Additionally, further refinement of our pre-analytical and post-acquisition normalization
techniques, in addition to metabolite quantification methods, have demonstrated stronger accuracy and higher
robustness. Indeed, we have identified in our feasibility studies a panel of metabolite markers that are 100%
specific and 83% sensitive – with 100% PPV and 94% NPV – in identifying ccRCC patients that progress to
metastasis at the time of primary ccRCC tumor resection (1.7 - 4.6 years sooner than standard of care). In
order to help validate our prototype, we will utilize the ccRCC biorepositories from the Eastern Virginia Medical
School PROBE cohort, Ontario Institute for Cancer Research Tumor Bank, University of Florida, University of
Virginia, and UT Health San Antonio; which account for over 894 renal tumors with associated patient data and
follow-up. We will begin prospective tissue collection at the University of Florida, Jacksonville, and continue
collection at UT Health San Antonio, which are accompanied by updated databases that further allow us to
identify patients who underwent a primary ccRCC tumor and metastasized (Cases) vs patients who did not
progress to metastasis (Controls). Paired “Normal” adjacent tissue will be obtained when feasible. For this
Phase II R&D, we will expand upon our extremely successful results from our pilot proof-of-concept studies
and further develop our prototype and commercialization strategies."

Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in
many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. I identified a small female-specific subgroup
of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels
when activated. My work serves as a “point-of-entry” to map out the rest of the circuitry that governs female
aggression. Aim 1 will continue to map pC1α neuron circuitry. My independent research program will incorporate
novel genetic and computational tools that I learned during my K99 phase and will continue interrogating the neural
circuitry underlying female aggression in health and disease. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and
agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other
related dementias. The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of
how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. Aim 2 will address what
happens to aggression in the early and late stages of neurodegenerative disease. I will shift my focus to looking at
aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal
protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. Based on my preliminary findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression
induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and
integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to
understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function or in the presence of a
neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. I
anticipate that our studies will uncover novel principles of brain function and also provide a platform for developing
therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease-related behavioral deficits. McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical
School will provide the necessary resources and support, and offer an ideal environment for carrying out the
proposed project and establishing an independent research program."
10939474,"Prediction of Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) early in treatment can enhance long-term survival outcomes for
breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and their long-term survival.1-3 Near-infra-
red spectral (NIRS) tomography (NIRST) provides operational advantages over other imaging technologies (e.g.,
mammography, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CT, Positron Emission Tomography) in the
NAC setting because it is noninvasive, portable, low cost, and does not use ionizing radiation or exogenous
contrast agents. Crucially, NIRS captures biophysical changes in tissue occurring in the vascular, intra- and
extra-cellular matrix compartments. These subtle changes signal a tumor's early response to NAC, even before
visible tumor size modifications occur.4-7 Compared to other optical imaging modalities that use reflectance light,
which limits tissue imaging depth8, 9, or require high-power lasers posing safety risks10, NIRST captures diffused
tomographic signals, allowing for deeper breast tumor sensing. In our previous studies, we have pioneered a
NIRST system that quantifies vascular changes in the breast during NAC, highlighting tumor response within
about two minutes as the patient sits in a semi-reclined position.11,12 This system correlates tumor NIRST
changes with clinical outcomes based on residual cancer burden (RCB) classification.13 Our clinical NIRST data
from 35 women on NAC persuades us of NIRST's potential to revolutionize the clinical approach to these patients.
This belief stems from recently published results which showcase the normalized percentage change of total
hemoglobin in a tumor (ΔHbT%) by the end of the first cycle as a compelling biomarker that discerns either
RCB-0 or RCB-II from all cases in other classes (p £ 0.001).13 A thorough multi-class Receiver Operating Curve
analysis offers an Area Under the Curve of 0.80, emphasizing the precision of ΔHbT% in distinguishing between
RCB classes. We envisage elevating our system's efficiency by integrating flexible circuit strips through a sleek,
wearable 64-channel breast interface and applying 3D image reconstruction that reflects full tumor response
(instead of partial tumor volume) – the focal point of our proposed Aim 3. Our previous data further indicate that
NIRST's diagnostic performance remains undiminished when relying solely on continuous-wave signals and
patient-specific scattering estimates derived from mammograms or MRI defined breast density.14 These insights
have shaped the hardware platform proposed in Aim 1. However, the current iteration of our NIRST system faces
challenges from its dependency on large-core fiber bundles for receiving light from the patient's breast. By phas-
ing out these cumbersome fiber bundles, we open avenues for novel 3D image reconstruction methods en-
hanced with deep learning—as set out in Aim 2. In essence, this project focusses on technological innovations
aimed at creating a comprehensive NIRST breast imaging platform, designed to forecast RCB in early stages of
NAC. Accordingly, we are transitioning this platform from academic exploration to a clinically practical solution,
while concurrently seeking additional funding to facilitate expansive clinical studies in the foreseeable future."
10939650,"Project Summary
 A central question in the genetics of complex traits is understanding how variation in DNA
sequences leads to variation in phenotype. Recent technological advances in high-throughput
phenotyping assays for model organisms and the establishment of large human biobanks and
consortium databases have provided opportunities to study the genotype-phenotype maps for
complex traits in unprecedented detail. However, it remains a major challenge to model and
interpret these data due to the intrinsic high dimensionality of the genotype space and the many
ways in which causal genes can interact. My research program is focused on developing new
theoretical frameworks and interpretable computational tools to analyze large genotype-
phenotype datasets with the goal of (1) accurately predicting phenotypes for novel genotypes and
(2) providing biological insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits by identifying key
genes, gene interactions, and pathways.
 The primary focus for my lab in the next five years is to develop new Bayesian and machine
learning methods capable of modeling the full spectrum of genetic interactions including pairwise
as well as higher-order epistasis. Specifically, we are combining rigorous mathematical modeling
with modern machine learning techniques to develop a suite of scalable, principled methods to
achieve accurate phenotypic prediction and accelerate the discovery of novel genetic
mechanisms. While proof-of-concept versions of many of the proposed methods display state-of-
the-art performance, substantial work remains to scale the methods to larger genotype-phenotype
datasets, test model performance on a wide range of complex traits and organisms, and interpret
the results to gain biological insights. In the coming years, we plan to build these methods into an
integrated framework for analyzing complex genetic interactions, which will include computational
pipelines for fitting accurate phenotypic prediction models, identifying gene interactions and
pathways for experimental validation, and quantification of estimation uncertainty. We will also
prioritize the development of user-friendly, GPU-accelerated software packages for all methods.
 Important applications of the proposed research directions include predicting disease risks in
humans, elucidating the genetic mechanisms for economically and clinically important traits, and
designing improved plant and animal breeding programs. The computational tools developed here
will be broadly useful to geneticists, evolutionary, and clinical biologists."
10928443,"Exposures to chlorine (Cl2) or bromine gas (Br2) may occur during industrial accidents and in the military arena.
Acute lung injury (ALI), followed by chronic lung injury (CLI) characterized by airway reactivity, fibrosis and
remodeling are significant concerns following halogen gas exposure; however, the mechanisms underlying this
transition to CLI after exposure to Cl2 or Br2 remain to be determined. An important tenet in CLI mechanisms is
protease dependent degradation and remodeling of the lung with neutrophil elastase (NE) considered a key
mediator. However, α1-anti-trypsin (α-1AT), an endogenous inhibitor of NE is typically present at higher levels
than NE raising the question how can NE mediate CLI in vivo. We recently discovered a novel mechanism where
NE is also bound to the surface of small exosome-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by PMNs during
their activation and degranulation. Importantly, when associated with EV’s, NE is resistant to inhibition by α-1AT
explaining how NE can induce pathogenic effects in the face of abundant α-1AT. We showed that NE+EVs are
proteolytically active in vitro and in vivo; administration of NE+EV’s to naïve mouse airways led to reactive airway
disease and a progressive destruction of the airways in an NE activity dependent manner. Thus, NE+EVs are
novel mediators of CLI; a role for these proteolytic EVs in halogen gas toxicity has not been investigated. We
hypothesize that PMN-derived NE+EVs mediate chronic lung injury after halogen gas exposure. Preliminary
data supporting this hypothesis include demonstrating that NE+EVs are elevated in the airways post Cl2 gas
exposure, and importantly cause progressive lung injury when administered to naïve mice. We propose two
aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the role of PMN-derived EVs in mediating CLI after halogen gas exposure.
Proposed studies will determine the temporal formation of EVs and changes in NE activity following exposure of
male and female mice, or rats, to either Cl2 or Br2 gas and relate these to the development of CLI assessed by
reactive airways, fibrosis and airway remodeling (morphometry). In addition, we will isolate EVs from lungs after
Cl2 or Br2 gas exposure, and then transfer them to naïve mice to evaluate their potential to cause CLI. Finally,
PMN depletion experiments will be conducted to confirm that formation of pathogenic EVs after halogen gas
exposure are derived from PMNs. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of NE activity associated with EVs in
mediating CLI after halogen gas exposure. We will determine the role of NE by comparing Cl2 or Br2 toxicity in
WT or littermate NE-/- mice and the lung injury causing potential of EVs from these mice will be compared. Finally,
to validate and identify EV associated NE activity as a novel target for countermeasure development, we will
develop and test a strategy that specifically inhibits NE activity on EVs and then determine the ability of the latter
to cause CLI after transfer to naïve mice. Collectively, the proposed studies will delineate a new and common
mechanism for Cl2 and Br2 toxicity mediated by PMN-derived EVs and identify EV-associated NE activity as novel
target for future countermeasure development."

 Addressing health disparities, especially in the face of COVID-19, requires an integrated multisector equity-focused,
community-based approach. First, community-partnered networks to engage communities, strengthen community-based
safety net systems, increase linkages to a wide variety of services, and promote community-wide MH awareness are
needed.13 Second, task-shifting MH support skills to non-MH providers in gateway settings has been found to effectively
address MH shortages worldwide, but has not been well studied in the U.S for low-income housing developments.14-18
Third, a syndemic approach can not only increase treatment engagement in health and mental health services, but also
may offer greater effectiveness for ethnic minorities with multiple barriers to care.19
 Guided by a CBPR process, our Harlem Strong Collaborative (CUNY Graduate School of Public Health, Harlem
Health Initiative, Center for Innovation in Mental Health, and Harlem Congregation for Community Improvement) will be
expanded to include Healthfirst (Managed Care Provider), and their network for primary care practices and Coordinated
Behavioral Care (Behavioral Health Provider) to create a multisector coalition to work together to implement an expanded
model of community collaborative care for evidence-based mental health to Harlem residents through two strategic
gateways (low-income housing developments and primary care). We will also leverage other CUNY institutes, centers,
and Firefly Innovations to support a hackathon focused on technological innovations to address barriers and needs
identified by the Harlem Strong Coalition.
 Our proposal examines the impact of Harlem Strong Community Mental Health and Economic Empowerment
Collaborative, a community-wide multisectoral coalition in which a health insurer works with community-based
organizations and medical and behavioral health providers to (1) problem solve financing, access, and quality of care
barriers, (2) support capacity building for mental health task-sharing for community health workers, (3) facilitate
coordination and collaboration across mental health / behavioral health, primary care, and social services, and (4) identify
a set of common metrics and strategies for continuous system quality improvement. The research study will evaluate the
impact and cost-effectiveness using a hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness design to assess effects of the Harlem Strong
Collaborative on system and consumer outcomes. We will also describe implementation outcomes and key informant
interviews to explore impact of community engagement, organization variables, and provider factors on model impact.
The long-term goal of our study is to develop a sustainable model for task-sharing mental health care that will be
embedded in a coordinated comprehensive network of services."
10930148,"Vivo is a virtual small group exercise program designed for adults 55 and over that is unique in the
increasingly popular digital fitness market. Vivo offers 3 key market differentiators: 1) a personalized and
individualized live training experience with feedback from a certified trainer, 2) a community of older adult
exercisers which enhances motivation and social support, and increase accountability and fun, and 3) the Vivo
training experience focuses on improving physical function using performance feedback, goal setting, and a
system to measure perceived exertion. Most older adults experience a 30% loss in muscle mass between ages
50–70. Resistance training is the most effective strategy for improving both muscle mass and function and
managing sarcopenia. Vivo’s programming is based on the scientific evidence that even in the absence of
chronic disease, resistance training that is customized to meet the individual’s needs and level of functioning is
a feasible and evidence-based approach to improve physical function, regulate glucose handling, reduce the
risk for falls, and prolong independent living and aging in place. To date 92 people have participated in Vivo
(age range 44-93). In our pilot study of 34 older adults (74% women; mean age 70.9 y; range 60-84y) after 8
weeks of participating in Vivo with a certified trainer (average of 12 hours of training per person) we observed
+25.8% improvement in upper body strength as measured by the 30 second arm curl test; +25.9%
improvement in lower body strength as measured by the 30 second chair stand test; and +28% improvement in
endurance as measured by the 2-minute knee raise test. The aims for this SBIR FastTrack are as follows:
Phase I Aim 1: Evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of current Vivo prototype in sedentary
older adults with prediabetes Milestone 1: Assess a) attendance, benefits and barriers/facilitators of
participation; b) ease of use; and c) overall satisfaction. Milestone 2: Assess trainer fidelity.
Aim 2
: Design
and develop a multifunctional platform prototype for Vivo 2.0 Milestone 1: Create functional specifications
of the client-centered approach (results, goals, adherence, upcoming workouts), and social engagement and
support. Milestone 2: Develop a clickable prototype of the platform. Phase II Aim 1: Design and build the
Vivo 2.0 platform – a unified web/mobile application. Milestone 1: Assess prototype usability. Milestone 2:
Iterate the design on the software and hardware to increase usage, accuracy and usability. Milestone 3:
Develop and test a minimum viable software product based on the new prototype and functional design to
include a mobile front-end and web front-end app and a backend database. Aim 2: Conduct a RCT to
determine effectiveness of Vivo 2.0 v. wait list control. Primary outcomes will be change in lower extremity

Core 2: Quantitative Neuroanatomy
 The neuroanatomy of orofacial circuitry has grown in complexity as viral-genetic tracing methods uncover
neuronal projections of a myriad of premotor and pre2motor neurons. New methodologies for brain-wide
localization of functionally labelled neuron populations at scale and techniques for reconstruction of the entire
extent of single neurons out to its most distal axonal projections will provide a comprehensive view of the
distribution and detailed connectivity of these cells within the orofacial circuitry.
 Aim 1 of the Quantitative Neuroanatomy Core will, in close partnership with Allen Brain Institute, provide a
mature pipeline for SPIM (selective plane illumination microscopy, a.k.a., light sheet microscopy) imaging of
brain-wide maps of labelled populations of premotor and pre2motor neurons, as well as localization of multi-
electrode arrays in the brain. In further samples provided by Project 4, the fine scale axonal projections of
individual premotor neurons as well as those of its inputs will be systematically reconstructed and examined.
These pipelines will serve to co-register labeled neuronal populations from different experiments onto a common
reference space, the Allen CCF: this is crucial for identification of neighborhoods of different types of neurons as
proximity can be predictive of functional interactions for coordination of multiple orofacial behaviors.
 Aim 2 of the Quantitative Neuroanatomy Core addresses the challenge of effective data-sharing across
neuroanatomy laboratories. Recently, the UCSD's site initiated the use of NeuroGlancer, an open-source 3D
volumetric visualization platform to visualize Cryojane (tape transfer) serially sectioned whole mouse brains with
premotor neuron fluorescent transsynaptic neuronal labeling from peripheral muscles. These samples parallel
our recent publications. We propose to prepare additional Cryojane samples (Projects 1, 3-5) to map new
premotor neuron populations in the context of the counter-stained cytoarchitecture. These are complementary
to samples run through whole-brain clearing and SPIM (see Aim 1).
 It is critical to the scientific success of the Team to have inter-project review of annotated histology files,
including data from the Allen Institute, for decisions about regional boundary annotations. To access these
NeuroGlancer files across laboratories, Core 2 will introduce BrainSharer, a Web-accessible platform for hosting
NeuroGlancer files initially developed in a collaboration (Samuel Wang laboratory in Princeton). Importantly, this
platform improves cross-laboratory interactions through real-time peer-to-peer review of three-dimensional data
sets with user-generated tools that support annotation of cells and of regions across Performance Sites."
10933257,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3 (OPC-RAD)
Modern-day X-ray–based radiation therapy (IMRT), given with chemotherapy, has improved survival outcomes
for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). However, various radiation-related late side
effects are known to cause progressive, irreversible long-term and delayed treatment sequelae, such as late
radiation-associated dysphagia (L-RAD). L-RAD, occurring in about 15% of long-term survivors of OPSCC, can
lead to chronic impairments in eating, weight loss, gastrostomy-tube dependence, and worse quality of life long
after cure of the OPSCC. L-RAD–related aspiration can result in pneumonia, hospitalization, death, and financial
toxicity for patients and the health care system. Strategies to prevent or mitigate L-RAD are urgently needed.
Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is less toxic than IMRT because it exposes less surrounding normal
tissues to damaging radiation than IMRT. The ability to identify patients most likely to benefit from IMPT to
mitigate the risk of developing L-RAD after IMRT would help to ensure the best use of limited resources. To date,
no such means of doing so have been identified. Pentoxifylline+Tocopherol (PENTOCO) are being investigated
for radiation-induced fibrosis; however, whether these drugs can prevent and mitigate L-RAD is unknown. We
are running the largest multi-site (21 institutions) phase II/III randomized trial comparing IMPT vs IMRT for the
treatment of OPSCC (NCT01893307); we recently completed the enrollment and treatment of all 440 patients.
Among the goals of this ongoing trial is to robustly characterize outcomes through 5 years after treatment. We
are also initiating a new prospective, longitudinal trial “STOP4LATE-FIBROSE”, which will have 250 patients
enrolled and is seeking the therapeutic potential of PENTOCO as antifibrotic agents in the early post-RT phase
to prevent and mitigate cutaneous and subcutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis. Here, to define the trajectories
and mechanisms underlying L-RAD after IMPT or IMRT, we aim to (i) extend data collection for trial
NCT01893307 to 10 years (outcomes are survival, toxicity, trismus measurement, test of masticating solids and
swallowing, taste impairment, salivary function, and oral intake score); (ii) analyze the collected data to identify
relevant markers of L-RAD (e.g., dosimetric, biological, imaging, functional, and patient-reported outcomes
[PROs]); (iii) evaluate whether IMPT (vs. IMRT) can prevent or mitigate L-RAD, and whether pentoxifylline+
vitamin E can prevent or mitigate L-RAD. Our long-term objectives are to identify means of preventing and
mitigating L-RAD. Our immediate goals are reflected in our specific aims: (1) Characterize L-RAD after IMPT
vs. IMRT, and identify phenotypes of L-RAD. (2) Determine mechanisms underlying L-RAD after IMRT vs. IMPT;
model the risk of developing L-RAD after IMPT vs. IMRT. (3) Determine the relative efficacy of PENTOCO for
preventing and reducing of L-RAD. We expect that the proposed study will reveal dosimetry, and biological-
based rationales for choosing IMPT vs, IMRT to prevent L-RAD; for using PENTOCO to prevent or mitigate L-
RAD; facilitating the choice of the best dosimetric plans for IMPT or IMRT, and consideration of de-intensification
with dose de-escalation and/or adaptive therapy."

patient-reported outcome (PRO) data alongside validated clinician-graded outcomes (CRO) and chart
abstracted metrics of adverse sequelae for the MD Anderson OPC Cohort for the OPC-SURVIVOR P01
Program portfolio. Since 2015, we developed and implemented procedures to collect PRO and clinician-rated
adverse effects from diagnosis through five years of survivorship. We will extend assessments of OPC survivors
beyond five years and integrate Project-specific PROF data elements as a critical resource for all Projects in the
OPC-SURVIVOR Program. We will work alongside all Project Investigators and Core Leads toward
development and validation of clinic-ready measures and markers of delayed adverse sequelae. Precise
outcome measurement in OPC survivorship is critical to characterize and mitigate adverse treatment sequelae
as key drivers of quality of life and functional status. We will accomplish our mission through these objectives:
1. To provide patient-facing MD Anderson OPC (MDA-OPC) cohort operations namely recruitment and retention
of human subjects for longitudinal, serial primary data collection and data management of PRO and CRO
markers of adverse sequelae.
2. To employ rigorous methods for data fidelity and timeline adherence. This includes infrastructure to monitor
and visualize metrics, and regular quality checks of PRO, CRO, and Project-specific data elements.
3. To maintain optimal data management infrastructure for data transmission in collaboration with all Cores.
4. To develop and integrate novel validated outcome measures into the PROF Core to measure and track cranial
neuropathies, mandibular osteoradionecrosis and late radiation-associated dysphagia.
5. To collaborate with the Clinical Informatics/Analysis Core to sustain and optimize a comprehensive and
integrated Web-based database management system to facilitate prospective data collection, entry, quality
control, integration, query, reporting, dashboards and data visualization of data for all Projects.
6. To employ patient-centered, user-friendly data capture methods to minimize patient burden, enhance study
retention and optimize Project outcomes collection.
7. To integrate new longitudinal data elements from Program Projects into existing data infrastructure.
9. To support the development of innovative longitudinal data analysis methods and machine learning models
that efficiently use all available elements in the database of the MDA-OPC cohort.
10. To capture rare symptoms while reducing patient burden through development of an enhanced,

10935437,"Overall Program Summary/Abstract
Every year 604,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 342,000 die from it worldwide. The overall
goal of our cervical cancer SPORE is, in the next 5 years, to better reach and protect the next generation of
women from oncogenic HPV infection, and to develop novel vaccines to improve treatment outcomes of patients
with persistent HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer, and cervical cancer.
Vaccines represent the most cost-effective and successful public health intervention. We include four vaccine
projects in this SPORE program based upon the success of prophylactic HPV vaccination for primary prevention
of cervical cancer, and advances in understanding of cellular immunology, including the mechanisms of
spontaneous viral clearance and the impact of HIV. The power of secondary prevention is evident from the
success of population-based cytologic screening programs and ablative treatment of high-grade cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia. Simultaneously, we recognize the continued need and cost of cervical screening even
in vaccinated patients, and for prevalent disease in the unvaccinated generations, and disadvantaged
populations for the next decades. The licensure of several screening tests for oncogenic HPV infection and
genotyping is revolutionizing screening, and HPV testing will likely be used for upfront screening. This will provide
an opportunity to eliminate persistent oncogenic HPV infections prior to progression to dysplasia and for
personalized cancer treatment by therapeutic HPV vaccination. It is clear that successful prevention and
treatment, and indeed eradication of cervical cancer, can be a reality by improving access to prophylactic HPV
vaccination and extending the breadth of coverage to all oncogenic HPV, and combining current screening and
treatment modalities with novel therapeutic HPV vaccine-based approaches. Therefore, there are three
overarching goals in this SPORE: 1) PRIMARY PREVENTION to reduce the global incidence of cervical cancer
by improving access to prophylactic vaccination through the development of a low-cost, thermostable RG1-VLP
formulation that needs to be administered only once to effectively prevent infection by all oncogenic HPV types
(Project 1), 2) SECONDARY PREVENTION by eliminating persistent HPV infection (Project 2) and associated
precancer lesions (Project 3) using innovative therapeutic HPV vaccines, and 3) Improving CANCER
TREATMENT of advanced cervical cancer to adjuvant standard of care by targeting minimal residual disease
with an innovative therapeutic HPV vaccination after chemoradiation (Project 4). This program is supported by
an Administrative/Communication Core (Core A), a Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Core (Core B), a
Tissue/Pathology/Immunology Core (Core C), and innovates and renews membership through a Developmental
Research Program (DRP) and a Career Enhancement Program (CEP). Our program will expand options for the
control of HPV-associated disease at multiple critical points during cervical carcinogenesis to improve outcomes."

SPORE activities from a unique perspective. Appropriate monitoring of patient safety, adverse events, and data
management and confidentiality will be provided by the data safety monitoring boards. The communication
component of the Core is directed at intra-SPORE, inter-SPORE, and National Cancer Institute research
activities. The Core coordinates essential Program interactions including preparing applications and progress
reports for the SPORE, all planning and evaluation activities, arranging and publicizing SPORE activities,
coordinating advisory committee meetings, producing annual reports and performing analysis of budgetary
matters."
10935441,"Project Summary/Abstract
Surgical or ablative treatment of cervical cancer precursors, i.e., high-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (HSIL)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3), has reduced disease incidence but is
associated with increased rates of infectious complications, cervical incompetence with premature
deliveries, failure to clear HPV, and disease recurrence. Additionally, persistent HPV infection can
cause pre-invasive and invasive disease at other sites (vagina/vulva/anus) that are harder to treat. The
overall goal of Project 3 is to test the safety and toxicity of a therapeutic HPV vaccine, the CRTE6E7L2
DNA vaccine, delivered intramuscularly (IM) via the TriGrid Electroporation Device, in HIV- and HIV+
patients (including HIV- patients on the kidney transplant waitlist) who have HPV16-associated HSIL
lesions of the cervix (CIN), vagina (VaIN), and/or vulva (VIN). We will also examine virologic and
disease outcomes. HPV16 is the most common genotype in cervical cancer, and it dominates (> 85%)
in other anogenital and head and neck malignancies. HPV-related cancer incidence is significantly
elevated in patients living with HIV and in organ transplant recipients, both in the cervix and at other
sites. These patients acquire more frequent multi-genotype infections, including many of genotypes
that are less common in healthy individuals and that are not targeted by the current HPV preventive
vaccines. Our candidate therapeutic and preventive HPV vaccine, CRTE6E7L2, comprises the
pNGVL4a DNA vector encoding the heat shock protein calreticulin (CRT) fused genetically with HPV16
E6 and E7 (each obligately expressed in HPV malignancies) as well as the L2 capsid protein (a broadly
protective antigen). Fusion with CRT profoundly enhances the potency of DNA vaccines in generating
HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses, even in CD4-depleted animals.
CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination also induces L2-specific neutralizing antibodies and protects from
experimental vaginal challenge. These features make the CRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine particularly
promising for use in patients living with HIV and transplant patients, which are both challenging groups
to treat. Although DNA vaccines are relatively safe and well suited for multiple administrations, in the
past, they have shown limited immunogenicity when administered alone by conventional intramuscular
needle injection, likely reflecting inefficient host cell transduction. In vivo electroporation is a much more
effective DNA vaccine administration method to generate HPV-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses.
Clinical responses to date have been highly encouraging in both HIV+ and HIV- patients. Our Specific
Aims in Project 3 are: (1) Evaluate the safety and toxicity of CRTE6E7L2 administered via
electroporation in HIV- and HIV+ patients with HPV16+ high-grade CIN/VaIN/VIN, including HIV-
patients on the kidney transplant waitlist; (2) Characterize the HPV16 E6/E7/L2-specific cell-
mediated and (3) humoral immune responses to vaccination of each cohort; and (4) Determine
the HPV and histopathological responses in the lesion and its microenvironment to vaccination
in each cohort."
10935442,"Project Summary/Abstract
One of the major challenges for control of advanced cervical cancer is the identification, via a suitable biomarker,
of treated patients who have residual disease and are at higher risk of developing recurrence and metastasis;
and prevention of such disease recurrence and metastasis using innovative immunotherapies. The purpose of
Project 4 is two-fold: 1) to conduct a pilot study of a new therapeutic HPV vaccine to determine its safety and
tolerance in women who have completed standard-of-care therapy for cervical cancer and have no clinical
evidence of cervical cancer, but potentially still carry minimal residual disease; and 2) to test whether cell-free
HPV DNA (cfHPVDNA) in plasma provides a specific biomarker for the presence or persistence of HPV+ cancer.
Our proposed adjuvant immunotherapy targets E6 and E7 of the two genotypes that cause > 70% of cervical
cancer cases (HPV16 and HPV18). This immunotherapy comprises priming with a plasmid DNA (pBI-11) and
boosting with a recombinant vaccinia virus (TA-HPV), a combination that elicits potent CD8+ T cell responses.
The pBI-11 DNA encodes HPV16/18 E6-E7 protein linked to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a novel technology
that profoundly enhances antigen presentation of these otherwise poorly immunogenic antigens. Previously, we
showed that vaccination with pBI-11's predecessor, pBI-1 (which expressed only HPV16 E7 fused to HSP70),
followed by intramuscular [IM] boost with TA-HPV, was safe and triggered histologic clearance in half of HPV16+
CIN2/3 patients. We further found that boosting with TA-HPV via skin scarification [SS] generated significantly
better HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, we hypothesize that after a
priming IM vaccination with pBI-11 DNA, boosting with TA-HPV vaccinia via skin scarification will elicit
a greater HPV-specific CD8+ T cell response than an IM boost, and can control minimal residual cervical
cancer remaining after standard-of-care treatment (surgery and/or chemoradiation). Ultra-sensitive
measurement of cfHPVDNA in plasma has promise as a biomarker to monitor cervical cancer disease burden,
and identify individuals at high risk for disease recurrence after primary therapy. Our preliminary data suggest
that a fully-automated, FDA-approved PCR-based test already used globally in screening can be readily adapted
to measure cfHPVDNA in plasma. To test our hypothesis, we propose: (1) To assess the safety and feasibility
of the pBI-11 DNA prime followed by TA-HPV boost (PVX7), wherein TA-HPV is administered via either IM
injection or SS, in patients with advanced cervical cancer who have completed primary therapy and have no
clinical evidence of disease; (2) To evaluate the systemic HPV16/18 E6/E7-specific cellular immune responses
to PVX7 immunotherapy regimens with TA-HPV administered via IM or SS in patients with advanced cervical
cancer who have completed primary therapy; and (3) To assess cell-free HPV16/18 DNA load in plasma pre-
and post-PVX7 immunotherapy using different HPV genome detection methods, and characterize progression-
free and overall survival for patients with advanced cervical cancer."

10933143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Liver disease is increasing in numbers and relevance across the globe. This disease causes no noticeable
symptoms in many cases. After diagnosis, the costs associated with medical care are very high. Patients can be
characterized on the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) spectrum based on the progressive presence of
steatosis (i.e. abnormal accumulation of fat within the liver), inflammation, ballooning, and then hepatic fibrosis.
Despite the rapid growth and prevalence, the only therapy to treat NAFLD are lifestyle modifications, such as
diet and exercise. While the pharmaceutical industry is actively pursuing the discovery and development of
candidate drug therapies to address this unmet medical need, there is an urgent clinical need for the ability to
noninvasively detect, accurately stage, and reliably monitor NAFLD. To that end, the goal of this research project
is to develop a system and method for multiparametric ultrasound (mpUS) imaging of nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) including early pathology progression. Our preliminary findings strongly suggest that a single
mpUS test that combines steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation information has the potential to provide a
comprehensive estimation of the main components of early stage NAFLD. The main innovation of the proposed
research project lies in the implicit link between biophysical models of NAFLD with these coordinated mpUS
measurements. The first objective of this project is to develop an integrated ultrasound system and method for
performing mpUS imaging. Then we will optimize this new imaging system in healthy rat liver. Lastly, we will
evaluate mpUS imaging with a rat model of NAFLD that mirrors disease progression in humans. Here we will
also optimize a biophysical model and longitudinal performance in the decision of NAFLD progression. If
successful, this research will introduce and validate a safe, cost-effective mpUS imaging technology that can
noninvasively detect, accurately stage, and reliably monitor NAFLD."
10933145,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The number of Native Americans (NA) entering the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
workforce is the smallest proportion of any ethnicity. At the same time, this group faces tremendous health
disparities, with many directly linked to brain health. Education in, and awareness of, neuroscience-related health
issues in NA communities involves three inter-related challenges: lack of a workforce culturally attuned to NA
communities, systemic lack of capacity for on-site biomedical research, and significant mistrust of western
scientific research and researchers. The proposed program focuses on developing NA health professionals and
academic researchers who possess both cultural competence and trust from their communities, elements critical
to eliminating health disparities and minority representation in STEM fields.
In addressing these challenges, we first recognize that many NA students approach the world and the means to
investigate it from fundamentally different philosophical perspectives. In contrast to highly reductionist Western
models, traditional NA epistemological models are more holistic and narrative-based. Importantly, these
models, in which animate and inanimate entities are connected and interdependent, should not be seen as
pedagogic deficits, but rather as an innate strength that may allow these students to construct and expand upon
sophisticated mental models of current scientific knowledge. We have developed an educational program that
integrates established best pedagogical practices with neuroscience research learning experience. By
integrating the holistic perspectives of NA cultures with the scientific problem-based approach of neuroscience,
we will advance and enrich both perspectives.
The training program proposed herein is designed to create a pipeline of NA students to advance from their
undergraduate programs to post-baccalaureate neuroscience programs at top tier research universities, creating
a model of culturally grounded STEM education while bolstering NIH workforce and cultural diversity. We will
accomplish this goal through a series of interrelated aims. Our first specific aim is to develop and institute a
recruitment plan to attract NA students interested in neuroscience. Our second specific aim is to develop a
research experience and scientific training that integrates established best pedagogical practices with
neuroscience research. Specifically, we will focus on developing the scientific literacy of the students, providing
them with professional development opportunities and a sense of belonging within the academic community.
Our third specific aim is focused on providing a mentoring and retention system for NA students to successfully
transition into neuroscience graduate programs."
10934513,"By 2023, it is expected that the number of VHA enrollees aged 65 and over will increase from 4.1 million to 4.7
million. To meet the growing demand for long-term care services, VA has attempted to expand its home and
community-based services (HCBS) through measures such as the 1999 Millennium Health Care and Benefits
Act (the Millennium Act). These expansion efforts were based on the premise that HCBS provide care in
Veterans’ setting of choice for a lower cost than in institutional settings and with comparable outcomes. Since
passing the Millennium Act, however, VA still lags significantly behind other health systems with respect to
rebalancing its long-term care expenditures away from institutional care and towards HCBS. VA’s 21
percentage point increase in the proportion of its long-term care expenditures spent on HCBS between 1999
and 2016 (from 5% to 26%) can be compared to Medicaid’s 42 percentage point increase over the same period
(from 15% o 57%). VA needs to examine the empirical evidence to understand why this transformation
remains elusive.
A health system’s ability to rebalance towards HCBS is determined by a combination of patient, system, and
family level factors. Precise patient targeting, local home health market conditions, and adequate supply of and
support for informal caregivers all contribute to how successful health systems will be in rebalancing towards
HCBS. However, these factors remain under-explored in the VA context – in part due to gaps in VA’s
structured data and in part due to the limited application of methods that enable these types of analyses. My
long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on leading research initiatives that help VA to
achieve its long-term care rebalancing aims and to fill these gaps in the existing evidence base.
The proposed research will strengthen VA’s knowledge of how patient, system, and family level factors are
affecting its rebalancing efforts. Specifically, the research aims of this CDA-2 are to: 1) use natural language
processing to extract patient functional status from free-text notes and use the constructed measures to
improve prediction of Veterans’ one-year risk of institutionalization; 2) build a geospatial database of VA and
VA-contracted home health providers and conduct analyses evaluating the association between distance to and
market supply of home health agencies and long-term care utilization patterns; and 3) quantify the impact of
informal care receipt on VA health care utilization and costs. I will achieve these aims by receiving mentorship
and training in natural language processing, risk adjustment, geospatial econometrics, and causal modeling.
These new skills will contribute to my overall career development and, in collaboration with my mentors and
operational partners, enable me to submit two merit review proposals focused on developing enhanced HCBS
patient targeting tools and improved caregivers supports. They will also enable me to submit an application for
a partnered evaluation initiative with the Office of Connected Care aimed at developing a geospatial tool to help
regional offices efficiently identify prospective partners for new home health service contracts.
Overall, this CDA will help me to become an independent investigator focused on leading research initiatives
that help VA achieve its long-term care rebalancing aims. The results of this CDA project will be relevant to
Veterans, their caregivers, and VA policy makers involved in allocating long-term care funding and will be an
innovative contribution to the broader literature on the determinants of successful HCBS expansion strategies."
10934514,"Overview: I am applying for a 5-year Career Development Award (CDA) to support my overarching goal of
increasing smoking cessation among patients with respiratory diseases. This will be accomplished through the
completion of mentored research activities and formal training designed to provide the skills necessary to
become an independent investigator. During the course of my award, I will develop and test a program of
proactive tobacco treatment for smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), delivered
electronically and designed to increase participation in evidence-based tobacco treatments.
Significance: COPD is one of the most common conditions cared for by the Veterans Health Administration
and 90% of cases are directly attributable to smoking. Though the VA has made great strides in tobacco
control, patients with COPD continue to smoke at rates double the overall VA average. Treatment for tobacco
use disorder is the most impactful intervention for smokers with COPD. Unfortunately, smokers with COPD
remain undertreated for tobacco use. Proactive tobacco treatment programs, where smokers are
systematically identified outside of a routine visit, engaged in a cessation attempt, and connected to evidence-
based treatment, have been found to be effective for increasing smoking cessation and use of quit support,
and may be particularly beneficial for smokers with COPD. Proactive programs are rarely implemented,
possibly due to high associated workload. Using electronic communication such as secure messaging to
deliver this care may be effective without the cost and workload associated with previously tested telephone
outreach programs. The intervention developed in this CDA proposal has the potential for wide-reaching
impact, leveraging existing VA resources more efficiently to increase cessation in this high-risk population.
Career Plan: My primary area of research has focused on identifying gaps in care quality for patients with
COPD, particularly in tobacco cessation treatment. To successfully achieve my goals of improving utilization of
tobacco treatment for smokers with COPD, I need further mentored training in implementation science
including: qualitative and mixed methods, design and testing of behavioral tobacco interventions with a focus
on mobile health, and cost analysis. I will achieve these objectives through formal coursework, seminars, and
mentored research activities under the guidance of Steven Fu, MD MSCE (primary mentor, Minneapolis VA
Health Care System [MVAHCS]), Hildi Hagedorn, PhD (MVAHCS) and David Au, MD MS (VA Puget Sound).
Research Plan: My primary research objective is to develop and test an electronic proactive tobacco
treatment program for smokers with COPD. To execute this goal, I will complete the following projects: 1) a
mixed methods (survey and interview) assessment of current use of health information technology among
smokers with COPD to (A) inform the creation of a proactive tobacco treatment program tailored to the target
population (B) assess the association between the chronic disease state and intention to engage with the
proactive program 2) a qualitative assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation of proactive
tobacco treatment programs for patients with COPD among staff and leadership to (A) understand the slow
adoption of proactive tobacco treatment interventions and (B) inform future implementation efforts, 3) a
randomized pilot of a proactive tobacco treatment program for smokers with COPD delivered through secure
messaging and compared to usual care to (A) assess feasibility and (B) quantify the cost of the program. The
proposed training and research projects will generate preliminary data necessary for development of a future
Investigator-Initiated Research (IIR) proposal submitted in Year 3. I plan to propose a randomized comparative
effectiveness trial comparing the intervention developed in this proposal to a previously tested telephone
method for increasing tobacco abstinence, launching my career as an independent VA HSR&D investigator
committed to improving Veterans’ health through enhanced access to tobacco cessation treatment."
10934530,"Background. As a psychologist with strong beginner implementation science competencies, Dr. Woodward’s
goal is to become an independent investigator and advanced implementation scientist to improve health equity
in VA by engaging vulnerable Veterans in implementing healthcare services. In this CDA, she will acquire skills
to identify, manualize, pilot, and rigorously evaluate effective methods to engage vulnerable Veterans (those
who experience health disparities) throughout the implementation process. Health care disparities persist in
VA. In community-based participatory research (CBPR), engaging consumers in research helps vulnerable
populations improve health behaviors and outcomes. Thus, implementation researchers could also engage
consumers in selecting and tailoring implementation strategies. Implementation strategies are techniques to
enhance uptake of an intervention (e.g., quality monitoring, sustainability planning). There is little consumer
involvement in this process likely because no formal guidance exists. Dr. Woodward will manualize methods to
engage vulnerable Veteran consumers (including families, caregivers, community members) in selecting and
tailoring implementation strategies. This manual (called Consumer Voice) will provide concrete guidance on
what, when, where, how, and why an implementer might engage consumers in implementing or redesigning
healthcare services. Dr. Woodward will pilot this manual in the context of implementing Safety Planning
Intervention (SPI) for suicide prevention, focused on rural Veterans, a population particularly vulnerable to
suicide. Suicide is VA’s top clinical priority. SPI is an effective intervention that reduces suicidal ideation and
behaviors. Dr. Woodward needs training in CBPR, mixed methods in implementation research, and
implementation strategy design. Significance/Impact. By adding Veterans’ voices throughout the
implementation process, VA can increase access to and quality of healthcare for vulnerable Veterans and
improve health equity. Dr. Woodward’s training will ensure her expertise in implementation science and health
disparities to meet VA’s needs. Innovation. Consumer Voice is timely given critical needs for innovative
implementation science to reduce health disparities and VA’s increasing emphasis on Veteran engagement.
Consumer Voice is novel as the first manual to guide a process for consumer engagement throughout
implementation; [although it will be piloted on SPI, it will be generalizable to other vulnerable groups and
interventions.] Specific Aims. 1) Identify and manualize methods to engage consumers in selecting and
tailoring implementation strategies (Consumer Voice). 2) Use Consumer Voice and pilot its acceptability,
feasibility, and preliminary effect on implementation and Veteran outcomes. 3) Evaluate SPI sustainment [as a
metric of Consumer Voice’s impact.] Methodology. In Aim 1, Dr. Woodward will use a CBPR approach to
develop Consumer Voice. During the Aim 2 pilot, Dr. Woodward will implement SPI in two community-based
outpatient clinics serving rural Veterans. The comparison site will receive Implementation Facilitation (IF) and
the implementation site will receive IF+Consumer Voice. Dr. Woodward will use mixed methods to assess
feasibility and acceptability of Consumer Voice. Dr. Woodward will use a pilot hybrid implementation-
effectiveness Type 3 design and compare IF to IF+Consumer Voice on: 1) implementation (reach, adoption,
fidelity); and 2) Veteran outcomes (depression severity, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior). In Aim 3, Dr.
Woodward will use mixed methods to re-evaluate Aim 2 outcomes at 12-month follow up to assess SPI
sustainment. Dr. Woodward will also gather qualitative data from stakeholders to understand what hinders or
promotes SPI sustainment and [compare the degree to which consumers were involved in each site’s

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) lacks effective treatment, primarily due to our limited scientific understanding of the
early cellular pathways leading to end-stage pathologies like amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau. To bridge this knowledge
gap, we propose significant advancements in XAI that can expedite data-driven discoveries in AD.
 The growing availability of multimodal single-cell data from donor cohorts, covering the entire spectrum of
AD pathology, underscores the need for machine learning (ML) models to learn low-dimensional embeddings,
a crucial step in interpreting these datasets. Current XAI technology addresses the opacity of supervised ML
models by calculating feature attributions, indicating the importance of individual features like gene expression
levels to the model’s output, such as a Aβ level, for specific samples such as cells. However, a significant gap
exists between model explanations and biological insights: (1) Current XAI techniques face limitations in the
context of unsupervised embedding learning and the integration of prior knowledge. (2) The computation of
accurate feature attributions poses challenges due to its exponential complexity. (3) Validating hypothesized
causal factors requires interventional experiment.
 IDEAL-XAI addresses these limitations by focusing on the following objectives:
Aim 1: Generate biologically informed explanations of AD progression. To bridge the gap between gene-level
attributions and systems-level explanations, our innovative XAI methods operate within a unified latent
embedding space, incorporating diverse biological concepts from prior knowledge. These methods interpret
patterns within the embedding space, including disease progression, to identify potential driver genes.
Aim 2: Compute accurate feature attributions to identify putative AD drivers. We propose theoretically
grounded techniques to rigorously compute Shapley values for modern large deep models such as transformers
and graph neural networks, handle feature correlations and multimodality, and evaluate feature attribution
methods in a principled manner to assist investigators discern the most effective techniques for their applications.
Aim 3: Validate computational hypotheses in human neurons and microglia. To validate our computational
hypotheses regarding AD drivers, we will perform experiments in human neurons and microglia, two critical
cell types in AD, across various stages. By modulating the expression of potential drivers in these cells, we aim
to measure their impact on various AD-related phenotypes, providing essential insights into therapeutic targets.
 The successful IDEAL-XAI project will significantly advance XAI principles and techniques, with broader
applications in biomedical research areas. Moreover, it will enhance our understanding of AD and expedite the
discovery of potential therapeutic targets. IDEAL-XAI represents a crucial step toward unraveling the mysteries
of AD and translating complex ML models into actionable biological insights."
10939461,"Age is the largest risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline. Many people living with HIV (PLWH) are aging
and at risk for Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Physical inactivity is a well-established
modifiable risk factor for dementia and increased physical activity (PA) is associated with improvements in
some markers of inflammation. Novel plasma biomarkers of ADRD (amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau
(pTau), and neurofilament light (NfL)) have been identified and are elevated in people living without HIV in
association with ADRD. Elevations of NfL in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be seen with HIV-associated
neuroinflammation, levels of Aβ and pTau may be less sensitive to inflammation. Plasma concentrations of Aβ,
pTau, and NfL in PLWH are not well-defined. It is unknown to what extent global cognitive function, physical
performance, frailty, PA, and inflammatory markers are associated with plasma biomarkers of ADRD among
older PLWH. We are leveraging the parent study Optimization of a behavioral intervention to increase physical
activity in older adults living with HIV (R01AG077989) for this administrative supplement (responding to NOT-
AG-23-015) focused on plasma biomarkers of inflammation and ADRD. Two-hundred PLWH aged 50 years
and older with low baseline physical activity and without dementia will be recruited for the parent study with
assessment of cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, anticipate a range of
scores in the normal and mild-to-moderate impairment range) at baseline, assessments of physical
performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB) and the frailty phenotype (modified Fried criteria) at
baseline and month 4, and ongoing detailed characterization of PA (steps/day). Our objective for this
supplement proposal is to characterize biomarkers indicative of risk for ADRD, and factors that influence levels
of these biomarkers, among a cohort of PLWH with low baseline PA. We will first examine cross-sectional
associations between plasma NfL (primary predictor), Aβ42/Aβ40, and pTau and global cognitive function
(primary outcome), physical performance, frailty, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6,
sCD163, sCD14, D-dimer). We will then determine if level of PA at baseline, and changes in PA over time, are
associated with baseline levels, and changes in levels, of plasma biomarkers of ADRD and inflammation. We
hypothesize that levels of PA and inflammatory markers will be associated with NfL, but not Aβ42/Aβ40 and
pTau, consistent with NfL more closely reflecting neuroinflammation. This study will provide novel data related
to associations of plasma Aβ, p-tau, and NfL levels with inflammatory risk markers that have been well-
validated in this population. We will also identify potential associations with key lifestyle and behavioral factors
that may affect levels of plasma ADRD biomarkers in PLWH. Findings will inform research using larger cohorts
to develop better risk prediction models and identify possible intervention strategies targeting cognitive and
physical function decline among older PLWH."

Text Mining and Large Language Models to Enhance Functional Annotation in UniProt of Protein
Variants Associated with Alzheimer's Disease
 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a common and devastating neurodegenerative disorder that currently
has no effective treatment. Many genetic variants associated with AD have been identified and, in some
cases, the molecular and clinical consequences of these variants have been elucidated and reported in the
scientific literature. As the premier resource for protein sequence and function information, UniProt is in an
ideal position to curate and disseminate this AD variant information to support research on novel therapies.
Here, we propose to use a combination of text mining strategies, including our previously developed
relation extraction tool eMIND, which captures information about the functional impact of variants in AD, as
well as a cutting edge GPT Large Language Model (LLM), to enable high-throughput curation of variants of
high interest to the AD community.
 We have previously developed eMIND, a transformer-based text mining system that extracts
relations between AD variants and functional impacts from the literature, and have demonstrated that it has
good performance on a selected set of AD-related abstracts. In this work, we will develop a pipeline to
automatically process PubMed abstracts at full-scale using eMIND and output variant-impact relations as
well as the abstracts and individual sentences from which they were derived. This information will be used
in conjunction with the LLM for several purposes. First, we will use the LLM to create natural language
summaries of the impact of AD-related variants based on sentences and abstracts identified by eMIND
(Aim 1). By focusing the LLM on text already flagged as relevant by eMIND, we will increase accuracy
while taking advantage of the LLM’s ability to synthesize information across sentences from multiple papers
and produce a highly readable product. All summaries will be manually evaluated by expert curators. Next,
we will develop a set of high-confidence variant-impact relations that can be used in applications, such
as knowledge graph representation and learning, that require information in a structured format (Aim 2).
We will use the LLM in two ways: (i) to assess the validity of the relations extracted by eMIND and (ii) to
extract relations de novo from eMIND-positive sentences and abstracts. The results of both approaches will
be manually assessed and compared. Finally, the most relevant relations and summaries of the functional
impact of AD-related variants obtained in Aim 1 and Aim 2 will be made available to users through the
UniProt API and website (Aim 3). We will seek feedback from the AD community about the quality and
presentation of the information.
 Taken together, this work will enable scalable curation of AD variant information of high value to the
AD community and serve as a model for a fully automated variant annotation workflow that can be
generalized to other diseases."

 Homelessness and associated traumas disproportionately impact Black women. While women experiencing
homelessness (WEH) universally face traumatic stress, Black WEH are disproportionately impacted by trauma,
including racial trauma. Repeated exposure to trauma contributes to the inequitable development of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), preventable biopsychosocial health adversity, and worsening of existing
health inequities. Our research has shown that Black WEH identify trauma as a priority health issue, yet,
evidence-based standard of trauma care remains largely unrealized in this population. In response to the dearth
of culturally acceptable trauma care models, our team pilot tested Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)—a brief,
human rights-informed trauma-focused treatment approach for complex PTSD. Our pilot showed strong
feasibility and effects of nurses delivering NET within shelter settings within six sessions. Interviews with Black
WEH, shelter staff, and mental health professionals, however, highlighted a missing element of cultural
resonance to enable trust building and long-term engagement with trauma care. Stakeholders desired a peer to
be included in the research—involving women with lived experience of homelessness, who most culturally and
experientially mirror participants—to complement and support nurse-delivery of NET. In response to
stakeholders, our solution, NurseNET, integrates a woman with lived experience, or “peer”, into the NET delivery
process. In NurseNET, “a Woman of Color”, “a person who’s been through it, who knows what it feels like” and
“is going to communicate differently” is positioned to be “a solution” to trauma. In this randomized controlled trial
(RCT), we will: Aim 1. Determine the effects of NurseNET in reducing PTSD and co-occurring symptoms in
Black WEH, accomplished via an RCT with 210 Black WEH; Aim 2. Demonstrate the effects of NurseNET in
addressing the social determinants of health (SDoH), including healthcare access, social support, racial trauma
impact, and financial self-efficacy (peers); Aim 3. Assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility
factors that impact implementation of and engagement with NurseNET, via validated surveys and in-depth
qualitative interviews. Cutting across all five NINR research lenses, we will (1) promote heath equity by reducing
and aiming to eliminate individual and structural inequities related to traumatic stress; (2) address and improve
the SDoH, focusing on trauma, particularly racial trauma; (3) foster population and community health, addressing
trauma as a growing public health challenge; (4) encourage prevention and health promotion, engaging Black
WEH in trauma-informed relationships that model optimal care engagement; (5) assess an innovative nurse-led
care model that can be embedded within existing healthcare systems, solving for long-standing clinical and policy
challenges. Our study will advance nursing research towards discovery of scalable nurse-led solutions to close
gaps in trauma care across disinvested communities to promote health equity."

CA261605
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) showing limited efficacy. Emerging evidence suggests the potential impact
of altered microbiomes on cancer progression and immunotherapy response. Additionally, bacteria have been
detected inside tumors, including HNSCC. Recent studies suggest a crucial role of the oral microbiome in
modulating the efficacy of ICIs. Moreover, environmental factors, particularly diet, have been linked to
microbiome alterations and impaired immunotherapy response. I propose to use preclinical mouse models,
human clinical specimens, and multiple omics techniques to identify the mechanisms through which the oral
microbiome influences cancer progression and immunotherapeutic responses. This research aligns with the
parental SPORE project of improving immunotherapy, yet brings new studies addressing microbiome effects
on cancer therapeutics and holds promise for improving patient quality of life through better treatment
outcome. Overall, the goal of this proposal is to leverage unique murine models and human patient samples
to advance our understanding of the role of the oral microbiome in HNSCC and enhance therapeutic
approaches. The hypothesis of this proposal is that alterations to the oral microbiome through diet
significantly impact immunotherapeutic response in HNSCC via the mechanisms of direct interactions between
microbiomes, tumor cells, the microenvironment, and indirectly by inducing metabolic changes to the host and
microbial metabolites. Aim 1 will examine the effects of changes in the oral microbiome from a Western diet
(WD) and on tumor growth of mouse HNSCC models. Aim 2 will assess the role of the oral microbiome on
immunotherapy response upon changes from a WD in HNSCC mouse models. Additionally, this aim will
examine if there are differences in oral microbiomes of human HNSCC patients between immunotherapeutic
responder (R) and non-responder (NR). Aim 3 will identify spatial and systemic predictive marker candidates of
immunotherapy response affected by dietary-associated microbiomes in mouse HNSCC models and human
specimens. This study will provide insight into the interplay between the oral microbiome, diet, cancer
progression, and immunotherapy response. It will also identify predictive biomarkers linked to altered
microbiomes in HNSCC."
10941883,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) protein aggregates in brain neurons is thought to
play a causal role in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is mounting evidence that the gut is a source of α-syn
aggregates in the brain; however, the factors involved remain incompletely understood, limiting development of
treatments to prevent PD. We propose a gut microbiota-mediated mechanism of α-syn aggregation. In the
brain, α-syn aggregation results when oxidative stress within the host transforms iron and dopamine into a
toxic pair. This toxic pair kills dopamine-producing neurons, decreasing dopamine levels and causing motor
dysfunction. We hypothesize that in the gut, the microbiota—not the host—creates the oxidizing redox potential
that modulates α-syn aggregation. Our preliminary experiments in vitro and in a C. elegans model of PD
indicate that when the gut microbe E. coli performs nitrate respiration, yielding the oxidizing agent nitrite, a
formerly innocuous trio of gut molecules—Fe2+, dopamine, and α-syn monomers—transforms into one that
generates toxic α-syn aggregates. What remains unknown is the impact of bacterial nitrate respiration on α-syn
aggregation in the mammalian gut. As accumulation of α-syn aggregates in intestinal tissue foreshadows
neurodegeneration in the brain, there is a critical need to discover the factors that initiate aggregation of α-syn
in the GI tract so that early interventions can be developed to stop PD before neurons die. This application’s
objective is to determine the molecular mechanism underlying nitrite-induced α-syn aggregation in intestinal
epithelial cells and to examine this mechanism as a gateway for α-syn aggregates to spread to neurons and
cause motor impairment. Such work would represent a major step toward demonstrating the relevance of this
phenomenon in human PD. The proposed approach to address these knowledge gaps entails (1) revealing the
role of dopamine in α-syn aggregation in host intestinal cells by using chemical and genetic tools, (2)
determining the impacts of nearly 100 gut microbes (in isolation and in combination) on α-syn aggregation in
intestinal cells and mapping biochemical responses via proteomics, and (3) tracking the formation and fate of
α-syn aggregates in intestinal cells by using bioluminescent reporters. Upon completing this research, our
contribution will be a detailed molecular mechanism for how the gut microbiome initiates α-syn aggregation in
PD. Our 3 complementary but independent specific aims interrogate this process at the level of molecules (Aim
1), the microbial ecosystem (Aim 2), and host physiology (Aim 3), providing a holistic roadmap for clinical
translation. This work is innovative because it employs an unprecedented systems-level approach to define
and control the gut microbiome’s role in PD. It is significant because it will likely reveal new therapeutic targets
for PD, potentially including intestinal dopamine and common species of gut bacteria. The most promising
therapeutic candidates can then be tested, first in mouse models and then potentially in clinical trials, to inhibit
the spread of α-syn aggregates from the gut to the brain."

The overarching goal of this multi-PI R01 proposal is to identify the mediators of functional cure of hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection in the cellular and humoral immune responses. Understanding the immune correlates of
HBV functional cure, but also the molecular pathways involved in the immune dysregulation leading to persistent
HBV infection and hepatitis will greatly facilitate design of effective immunotherapies and therapeutic
vaccinations. HBV chronically infects >250 million people and remains a significant public health burden, despite
the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine for more than 30 years. While some infected individuals can
naturally control viral replication, known as functional cure, the required immune conditions, particularly in the
CD4 T cell and B cell responses, are undefined. Similarly, the exact mechanisms of how HBV-specific CD4 T
cell and B cell responses are subverted in persistent infection remains unclear. In this study, we will study the
immune responses of well-defined clinical cohorts across the different HBV infection outcomes. The two aims
are: (1) to define HBV-specific CD4 T cell functions and the molecular signatures important in immune
suppression versus cure; (2) to define HCV-specific humoral responses and the molecular signatures in B cells
associated with viral pathogenesis and cure. The two highly complementary and synergistic aims will be
analyzed in a highly integrated systems approach, allowing novel understanding of how CD4 T cells, antibodies
and B cells synergize in order to control HBV infection. By using the same tissue specimens from the clinical
cohorts for all we will achieve a holistic and integrated understanding of the immune landscapes presented in
the different manifestations caused by HBV infection. The results have the potential to guide novel
immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at inducing sustained control of HBV without the need for life-long antiviral
treatments."
10942178,"Diisocyanates are crucial ingredients in many important products and industries (i.e. construction,
automotive, aerospace, medical, military/civilian). Recognized in 1951 as occupational allergens, progress in
understanding diisocyanate asthma has lagged behind that of environmental asthma. Gaps in understanding
diisocyanate asthma pathogenesis impede almost all aspects of disease control; exposure surveillance and
prevention, disease screening and diagnosis, and prophylactic or post-exposure therapeutics or treatments.
Differences between diisocyanate asthma and common environmental asthma are especially critical to
screening and clinical workup, notably the lack of antigen (e.g. chemical)-specific IgE in affected workers.
Individuals that continue to work with diisocyanates after developing “hypersensitivity” face long-term adverse
pulmonary health outcomes, and in rare cases have died.
 In a prior R01 we developed a novel approach for delivering diisocyanate to the lower airways in mice
(overcoming upper airway “scrubbing” that hampered prior studies) to help understand pathogenic responses
and identify new exposure biomarkers useful for exposure surveillance. Our novel mouse diisocyanate asthma
model has provided substantial insight into the immune responses triggered by exposure, particularly
differences between pathogenic responses in immune sensitized hosts vs. non-pathogenic responses in non-
sensitized hosts and differences in chemical (MDI) asthma vs. environmental asthma (see preliminary data).
Importantly, the data highlight innate immune responses that differentiate “self” from “non-self” as a critical
aspect of pathogenesis and identify candidate genes and molecular targets that mediate this process.
 The present investigation proposes to complete the elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms triggered by
diisocyanate using our animal model and to translate promising preliminary findings in mice on biomarkers to
clinical samples from exposed workers. We hypothesize that we can utilize our mouse model of diisocyanate
asthma, taking advantage of genetic manipulation and experimental drugs that focus on specific molecular
targets, to better understand the mechanisms that differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic responses.
We further hypothesize that exposure biomarkers from animal studies, including di-lysine-diisocyanate recently
discovered by our laboratory, can translate to humans and serve as an effective basis for biomonitoring
workplace exposures. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Identify and characterize the dendritic cell(s) that initiates
pathologic systemic immune sensitization to diisocyanate. Aim 2. Identify and characterize the effector cells
and molecules in the lungs that mediate asthma pathology following respiratory tract exposure. Aim 3. Identify,
validate, and translate biomarkers of diisocyanate exposure and sensitivity/disease. The application is relevant
to Construction, Manufacturing, and Transportation NORA sectors and Respiratory Health, Immune, Infectious
and Dermal Disease Prevention cross-sectors."
10942235,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating genetic disorder that predominantly impacts the lungs and pancreas due to
mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Specifically, nonsense
mutations, which produce truncated, non-functional proteins, account for approximately 11% of all CF cases.
Currently, these mutations lack targeted, effective therapeutic solutions. Our research endeavors to address this
unmet clinical need by harnessing the capabilities of adenine base editors (ABEs) to correct premature
termination codons (PTCs) through translational readthrough, thereby restoring functional protein expression.
To facilitate efficient delivery, we aim to formulate lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) specifically engineered for
pulmonary ABE delivery. The project is segmented into three pivotal objectives: 1) the chemical refinement of
RNA-encoded ABEs to achieve optimal on-target gene-editing; 2) the development and fine-tuning of LNP
formulations to overcome challenges intrinsic to pulmonary delivery; and 3) comprehensive in vivo validation
using a CFTR nonsense mutation mouse model to assess both therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles. By
focusing on nanoparticle-mediated lung cell engineering, our approach lays the foundation for a groundbreaking,
non-viral base editing platform that could revolutionize treatment protocols for CF and other diseases stemming
from PTCs. Employing cutting-edge methodologies, including the optimization of mRNA sequences encoding
ABEs, gRNA design, and novel four-component combinatorial lipid chemistry, our project has the potential to
substantially advance genomic editor delivery to the pulmonary system. These innovations could reconfigure
therapeutic strategies for CF and other genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations. The feasibility of this
high-impact work is reinforced by our lab's established expertise in these technologies, making it a viable
candidate for significantly advancing the nonviral delivery of genomic medicines and thereby enhancing the
therapeutic options for a wide array of lung diseases."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating hematopoietic malignancy characterized by clonal expansion of
leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Despite advancements in chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapies, most
AML patients remain incurable. Thus, novel therapies targeting key leukemogenic pathways are needed. RNA
modifications are essential modulators of post-transcriptional gene regulation, and their dysregulation emerges
as a contributor to AML. Through an integrated analysis of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen data, we
discovered that AML cells preferentially depend on METTL1, an RNA methyltransferase that mainly catalyzes
7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification on transfer RNAs (tRNAs). METTL1 is highly expressed in LSCs and
AML specimens, and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. METTL1 depletion
significantly suppresses AML growth, eradicates LSCs in vitro, and attenuates AML progression in an AML
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Importantly, those effects are largely dependent on METTL1’s m7G
methyltransferase activity, offering a unique opportunity for AML therapy through the development of small-
molecule inhibitors targeting its enzymatic activity. Via a high-throughput screen, we have discovered a selective
and potent METTL1 inhibitor with promising anti-AML activity. Moreover, METTL1 loss significantly reduces the
m7G abundance on tRNAPheGAA and its overall expression. This, in turn, leads to translation suppression of
transcripts that heavily rely on tRNAPheGAA-related codons, such as tyrosine-protein kinase HCK. The decreased
expression of HCK due to METTL1 depletion could further disrupt C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)
signaling, which is essential for LSC homeostasis. Despite these insights, we do not yet understand the exact
mechanisms by which METTL1 loss results in AML suppression and LSC eradication. We hypothesize that
METTL1 functions as an m7G methyltransferase to drive AML development and sustain LSC frequency, making
it a potential ‘druggable’ target for treating high-risk AML. These hypotheses will be addressed in three Specific
Aims. Aim 1 will further consolidate the importance of METTL1 function in AML using mouse models. In this
Aim, we will utilize a number of AML models with different genetic backgrounds to rigorously determine the roles
of METTL1 in AML initiation and progression. Aim 2 will understand the role of METTL1/tRNAPheGAA/HCK
signaling in LSC homeostasis. This Aim will delineate the molecular mechanism through which the METTL1/m7G
axis facilitates LSC homing and self-renewal ability. Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of
pharmacologically targeting METTL1 to treat AMLs."
10943499,"In delirium and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which increase the risk for each other, patients suffer deficits in
executive functions, including attentional control. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the mecha-
nisms by which attentional control capacity may promote cognitive resilience in both delirium and dementia.
 Even under normal conditions neural resources for navigating the world around us are fundamentally limited
(ie, we can’t attend to everything in our environment), yet attentional control allows the brain to effectively allocate
neural resources to accomplish cognitive tasks. During stressors that limit neural resources further, eg neuro-
inflammation after surgery or AD-related neurodegeneration, attentional control can compensate for neuronal
injury to preserve cognitive function by marshaling remaining neural resources. Given the potential protective
benefits of robust attentional control, this proposal introduces attentional resilience—ie the ability to retain
robust attentional control despite physiological stressors—and evaluates its potential underlying neural mecha-
nisms using the stressor of scheduled surgery in cognitively healthy older adults as a “natural experiment.”
 Our overall objective is to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying attentional resilience, which
enable individuals to more effectively allocate neural resources to remain attentive to their surrounding environ-
ment despite neuronal injury and/or neuro-inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that neural mechanisms
underlying robust attentional control before surgery facilitate attentional resilience after surgery. Our aims eval-
uate neural activity patterns that have been linked to robust attentional control. Given the well-established link
between electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha (7-13 Hz) power and attentional control, Aim 1 focuses on the ability
of attentional control processes to enable attentiveness by attenuating alpha power. In Aim 2, we explore alpha-
driven enhancement of sensory processing, an attentional control mechanism that amplifies neural responses
to relevant sensory stimuli. These attentional control processes facilitate externally directed attention, and we
will evaluate how their mechanisms relate to attentional resilience. Building on this, Aim 3 explores neural circuit
contributors to these attentional control processes as possible mechanisms underlying attentional resilience.
Because robust neural circuits depend on healthy neuronal substrates largely free from AD-related pathology,
we will evaluate the effect of tau pathology on attentional resilience mediated by coordination of the dorsal at-
tention network and the default mode network, two complementary neural circuits critical for attentional control.
 In sum, this project will advance understanding of why some older adults maintain strong attentional perfor-
mance after surgery while others do not. In particular, this work will reveal key neural-systems-level mechanisms
that support attentional control capacity and link low-level neuronal damage to diminished high-level cognitive
performance. Finally, this work supports the long-term goal of identifying potentially modifiable neural targets for
delirium and dementia interventions."
10943151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Several lifestyle and genetic major risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are
generally associated with increases in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. In other tissue systems, changes in
ECM stiffness are known to elicit pathological epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which once-
mature cells de-specialize and transform to a proliferative, migratory, and fibrotic phenotype. EMT of retinal
pigmented epithelial (RPE) and choroidal endothelial cells (ChECs) is acknowledged as a hallmark of AMD,
but the relationships between AMD risk factors and EMT remain unknown. To better understand and treat
AMD, there is a critical need to determine how RPE and ChECs respond to changes in ECM stiffness. In this
application, the overall objective is to determine how matrix biomechanics impact RPE and ChEC fate using in
vitro and ex vivo models of tissue stiffening. The central hypothesis is that matrix stiffening plays a role in
chorioretinal EMT by activation of mechanical transduction signaling pathways. The rationale for the proposed
research is that detailed understanding of the role tissue stiffening plays in AMD progression is likely to provide
a solid foundation upon which to base the development of preclinical interventions targeting druggable
signaling pathways for treatment of early AMD. Two specific aims will be used to test the central hypothesis.
Aim 1: determine how matrix stiffening impacts RPE and ChEC EMT in vitro. Human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), including some from donors with high-risk ARMS2/HTRA1 polymorphisms, will be differentiated
to RPE and ChECs and seeded on hydrogels that match the stiffness of the RPE/choroid tissue complex. Step
changes in matrix stiffness that correspond to moderate and advanced aging will be instigated using in situ
photocrosslinking. Migration, proliferation, loss of RPE and ChEC markers, gain of mesenchymal markers,
activation of mechanical transduction pathways will be characterized. Aim 2: demonstrate that matrix stiffening
leads to chorioretinal tissue EMT ex vivo. Porcine RPE/choroid tissue will be used to create an ex vivo model
of tissue stiffening via photocrosslinking and subsequent tissue culture with or without exogenous HTRA1.
Human donor RPE/choroid tissue (AMD and age-matched controls) will also be evaluated. For all tissue types,
spatial stiffness maps will be created using atomic force microscopy, with simultaneous imaging of EMT protein
localization. The proposed research is innovative because it uses new approaches to in situ matrix stiffening,
focuses on matrix stiffness as a possible contributor to AMD pathophysiology, and explores the interplay
between genetic risk factors and EMT. The primary expected outcome of the proposed research is a detailed
understanding of the intersections between matrix stiffness, genetic risk, and EMT of RPE/choroid in the
context of AMD. This contribution will be significant because it is likely to set the stage for identifying new or
combinatorial therapeutic strategies for AMD that could address subretinal fibrosis and inflammation, or
otherwise enable AMD progression to be slowed, stalled, or reversed."

Metastasis is the main cause of deaths related to malignant melanoma. Studies over the last decade have
revealed that the metastatic process is not primarily driven by genetic changes. Instead, deregulation of gene
expression through epigenetic, transcriptional, or posttranscriptional mechanisms as well as copy number
alterations may promote melanoma metastasis. Our previous work described how messenger RNAs engage in
protein coding-independent posttranscriptional regulation by sequestering microRNAs (miRNAs) from other
transcripts, and we termed such natural miRNA sponges competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs).
Deregulated ceRNA expression has been causally linked to cancer development, and thus genomic copy
number gains of ceRNA genes may be an important driver of malignant progression of melanoma. We have
identified a cluster of melanoma ceRNA genes localized on chromosome 1q, which undergoes copy number
gains (1qGAIN) in 25-50% of melanoma. 1qGAIN is more frequent in metastases, suggesting that 1qGAIN ceRNAs
may contribute to melanoma progression. Our predictions identified CEP170 as a potent 1qGAIN ceRNA, and
preliminary experiments revealed its oncogenic role in vitro and in vivo. Two additional 1qGAIN ceRNAs,
NUCKS1 and ZC3H11A, exhibited oncogenic potential and enhanced the CEP170-mediated effects. Thus,
gains of 1q may lead to overexpression of multiple ceRNAs that promote melanoma metastasis by
sequestering tumor suppressive miRNAs. We have identified five metastasis-associated miRNAs that are
sequestered by CEP170 and that promote melanoma cell migration and invasion. In this proposal, we will
systematically examine the oncogenic role of 1qGAIN ceRNAs in melanoma metastasis. Specifically, in Aim 1
we will examine if the 3’UTR of CEP170 promotes melanoma dissemination in a miRNA binding site-specific
manner using metastasis and autochthonous models. In Aim 2 we will assess if the release of miRNAs from
the endogenous CEP170 transcript opposes metastasis, and if these miRNAs have tumor suppressive activity
in melanoma cells. Moreover, we will identify and characterize downstream effectors that mediate the CEP170-
provoked phenotype. Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine if NUCKS1 and ZC3H11A boost the effect of CEP170
by augmenting miRNA sequestration. We will also test if any of the remaining 1qGAIN ceRNAs, ten in total,
possess oncogenic activity and cooperate with CEP170. We expect that our study will reveal the biological
relevance of 1qGAIN ceRNAs to melanoma metastasis and further elucidate the mechanisms underlying ceRNA-
mediated melanoma progression and metastasis."

growing evidence that mitovesicles – their levels, production, and composition – are altered in neurogenerative
diseases and during aging. In several systems where mitophagy is compromised we have shown an increase in
mitovesicles numbers. These findings have led us to propose that mitovesicle secretion supports mitochondria
homeostasis by eliminating detrimental mitochondrial materials from the cell, acting as an important and selective
mitochondrial quality control. Further, when mitophagy is inefficient and mitochondria are stressed, enhanced
mitovesicle production may support cell survival by eliminating oxidized and damaged mitochondrial
components. We have exciting preliminary findings showing that APOE genotype differentially regulates both
brain mitovesicle levels (in the following rank order APOE2>APOE3>APOE4) and their content. Given our
proposed role for mitovesicles as an important mitochondrial quality control, this project will address our
hypothesis that the enhanced release of mitovesicles in APOE2 is beneficial, protecting the cell from
mitochondrial damage, whereas the lower mitovesicle biogenesis in APOE4 is deleterious. Testing whether
APOE genotype and aging modulates mitovesicle levels and content, Aim 1 will elucidate the effects that APOE
genotype has on brain mitovesicles in humanized APOE mice at various ages, with mouse findings confirmed in
human brain tissue. Aim 2 will determine in vitro and in vivo whether mitovesicle production is a protective
component of mitochondrial quality control, one that is enhanced by APOE2 expression and compromised by
APOE4, and whether mitochondrial stress is moderated by robust mitovesicle production. In addition to “waste
removal” mediating mitochondrial health, we have preliminary findings showing that mitovesicles are biologically
active once in the extracellular space, including effects on long-term potentiation (LTP). In Aim 3, we will
determine the impact that brain mitovesicles of differing APOE genotypes and ages have on LTP and
synaptotoxicity, testing the idea that APOE4 causes a “double-hit”, with a reduced number of mitovesicle
compromising mitovesicle-mediated mitochondrial quality control, while the secreted mitovesicles lead to the
transmission of mitovesicle-driven toxicity to other cells. Specifically, this aim will investigate how mitovesicle
content determines the neuronal and synaptic impact of mitovesicles once in the extracellular space, examining
their uptake by target cells, their impact on mitochondria once internalized, and their impact on synapses and
synaptic function. These studies will define the novel role of mitovesicles in mitochondrial homeostasis, a quality
control pathway for mitochondria that we propose is modulated in the brain by APOE genotype."
10943805,"PROJECT SUM MARY: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide. Though Intravenous (IV) tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) improves outcome after stroke, it is limited by secondary injury including
hemorrhagic transformation, blood-brain-barrier disruption and edema. Activation of complement C3 plays a key
role in stroke pathogenesis, as the C3a anaphylatoxin binds to its receptor to exacerbate acute post-ischemic
brain injury. However, the mechanisms underlying this injury remain unclear. This study will for the first time
define a crucial link between complement C3a receptor associated inflammation and myeloid cell mediated
synaptic dysfunction post-stroke. Our long-term goal is to translate C3aR antagonist therapy to enhance
reperfusion therapy in stroke. To realize this goal, a thorough understanding of complement-dependent
processes in ischemic brain is essential. Our central hypothesis is that increased endothelial C3a/C3aR
signaling worsens post-ischemic BBB dysfunction, inflammation, synaptic loss, and functional impairment. We
propose the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that genetic inhibition of endothelial C3aR protects the BBB, abrogates
inflammatory myeloid cell infiltration, and confers neuroprotection following stroke. WT and C3aRflox/flox-
Cdh5Cre+aged mice following PT/Sham surgery will be assessed for neurological function, BBB integrity, and
tissue biochemistry for 3 months. Brain/blood samples will be collected for FACS-analysis of myeloid cell subsets
to evaluate tissue infiltration of peripheral immune cells and tissue histology.
Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate that endothelial C3aR genetic deletion will protect against the
deleterious effects of post-ischemic tPA administration even at delayed time-points. WT and C3aRflox/flox-
Cdh5Cre+aged mice following PT surgery concurrent with i.v. tPA administration (administered at 4h,8h,12h,24h)
will be assessed for hemorrhage, BBB integrity, edema, neurological function, tissue biochemistry for 3 months.
Brain/blood samples will be collected for FACS-analysis as in Aim 1
Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that C3aR mediates post-ischemic synapse elimination and demonstrate
that inhibition of this process improves long-term functional outcome. WT and C3aRflox/flox-Cdh5Cre+aged
mice following PT surgery will be assessed for synaptic function using electrophysiology. Brain and blood
samples will be collected for FACS and tissue histology analysis of microglia, neurons, synaptic protein and
puncta density in the peri-infarct region over varying time intervals.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We anticipate that complement inhibition will attenuate both the acute neurovascular
injury associated with post-ischemic tPA administration as well as long-term neurological dysfunction associated
with post-ischemic synapse elimination in aged mice. IMPACT: These studies will provide foundation for future
efforts to translate therapies targeting the deleterious aspects complement activation into human stroke patients."

10934069,"Abstract (Overall)
The mission of the Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) is to provide biomedical investigators with the
rat models, embryonic stem cells, related reagents, protocols, information, support and services that will facilitate
their research. The RRRC serves as a unique repository by importing, storing and distributing a large number of
rat strains/stocks. It assures that valuable models are preserved and made available to interested investigators,
allows researchers to satisfy NIH requirements for resource sharing, relieves individual investigators from the
burden of animal distribution and ensures that models are maintained with rigorous genetic quality control and
health monitoring to promote experimental rigor and reproducibility. Recent advances in genome editing
technologies are facilitating the ability to perform sophisticated genetic modifications in rats in order to study both
normal biological processes and disease states. As a result, the number of rat models and the number of
investigators using rat models for biomedical research is increasing and the RRRC, as one of the only centralized
repositories in the world will continue to serve a critical role for archiving and distributing these new models. To
improve repository functions, applied research to optimize methods for sperm cryopreservation and in vitro
fertilization in the rat will be undertaken and ongoing efforts to refine, generate and characterize new genetically
modified rat models needed by the research community will be performed. To expand the broad utility of the
RRRC, we will continue to serve as consultants to the community and we will increase our fee-for-services in
the areas of model generation, model characterization, colony management, cryopreservation and rederivation.
By providing accessible expertise to investigators working with rats and by expanding our available materials
and services, the RRRC will continue to serve as a much-needed “one stop” resource for investigators using rats
in biomedical research."
10934209,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations of TP53 are present in approximately 10-15% of cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and approximately 35% of cases of therapy-related MDS/AML. The presence
of TP53 mutations is an adverse prognostic factor that outweighs other known variables. Indeed, only ~30% of
patients with TP53-mutant AML respond to standard induction therapy with a median survival of 5-9 months. We
and others showed that hypomethylating agents have therapeutic activity in TP53-mutated MDS/AML. However,
mutation clearance is rarely complete and nearly all patients relapse. Thus, there is a pressing unmet clinical
need for more effective therapies for TP53-mutated MDS/AML. Our preliminary data show that TP53-/- AML cells,
while resistant to cytarabine and daunorubicin, are sensitive to decitabine. Using DNA fiber assays and
immunoblotting, we show that decitabine induces DNA replication stress and ATR activation, which is
accentuated in the absence of p53. Thus, p53 is required for the efficient resolution of DNA replication stress
induced by decitabine. Based on these data, we hypothesize that TP53-mutated MDS/AML is selectively
sensitive to ATR inhibition when combined with decitabine-induced DNA replication stress. Consistent
with this hypothesis, we show that combined treatment with an ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and decitabine induces
strong synergistic killing of TP53-/- AML cell lines. To develop the therapeutic potential of ATRi plus decitabine
for TP53-mutated MDS/AML, the following aims are proposed.
 Aim 1. Characterize the therapeutic activity of ATR inhibition in combination with decitabine in TP53-
mutant MDS/AML. We will conduct an open-label, phase I study of the oral ATR inhibitor, camonsertib, in
combination with oral ASTX727 (decitabine/cedazuridine) in patients with AML or high-risk MDS through the NCI
Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trial Network (ETCTN).
 Aim 2. Define the molecular mechanisms by which decitabine synergizes with ATR inhibition in TP53-
mutant AML. Based on preliminary data, we have identified the following key questions that will be addressed
in this aim, including: 1) does ATRi + decitabine induce mitotic crisis; 2) is the synergy of decitabine with ATRi
dependent on DNA hypomethylation: 3) what role does p53-induced CDKN1a (p21, CIP) play in decitabine-
induced cytotoxicity; and 4) what are the ATR-dependent (and independent) genes that contribute to decitabine-
induced killing in TP53-mutated AML
 We believe that the results of this study will provide evidence of safety, pharmacodynamic evidence of target
engagement, and preliminary evidence of efficacy to support further testing in randomized phase 2/3 studies.
The molecular studies in Aim 2 should provide new insight into how the loss of p53 sensitizes AML cells to DNA
replicative stress and may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention."

10943035,"ABSTRACT
Antigen presentation is a fundamental component of cancer immunity. The primary cytotoxic effectors of cancer
immunity are CD8+ T cells, which recognize peptide antigens presented in the context of Major Histocompatibility
Complex Class I (MHC-I). These foundational interactions between cancer cells and immune cells underlie the
success of immunotherapy. Antigens derived from somatic mutations, called “neoantigens”, have garnered
significant interest for the design of next generation immunotherapies. However, neoantigens suffer from
significant clonal heterogeneity within tumors and are specific to individual patients, limiting their widespread use
in engineered immunotherapies like cancer vaccines. To address this limitation, advances in mass spectrometry
have enabled direct measurement of the full repertoire of peptides known to bind MHC-I which is collectively
known as the “immunopeptidome”. Ever increasing depth and resolution in measuring the immunopeptidome
has revealed numerous sources of cancer specific antigens beyond neoantigens, including peptides derived
from cryptic translation events from novel unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs). Notably, immunotherapy
trials in cancer have revealed that antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses extend far beyond just mutated
neoantigens, especially in low tumor mutation burden patients, highlighting a critical need to understand
additional classes of tumor specific antigens like nuORFs. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which
nuORFs are presented may reveal novel pathways that could be pharmacologically targeted to increase cancer
immunogenicity. We hypothesize that nuORF antigens are synthesized, processed, and presented
through a non-canonical mechanism that utilizes cap-independent translation and co-translational
quality control to facilitate their presentation on MHC-I for immunosurveillance. Our preliminary analysis
demonstrates that specific translation inhibitors that promote cap-independent translation alter the antigenic
landscape of lung cancer. In this proposal, we will build upon these observations and utilize a combination of
sophisticated genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and human cancer cell lines to define the
mechanisms that influence nuORF biosynthesis, processing, antigen presentation, and CD8+ T cell recognition.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate how pharmacological and physiological manipulation of translation alters presentation
and recognition of nuORF derived antigens. In Aim 2, we will assess the contribution of co-translational quality
control mechanisms in shaping non-canonical antigen presentation. Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is to
understand the mechanisms by which nuORFs are presented to more effectively engage this class of targets for
immunotherapy."
10943041,"Project Summary/Abstract
Medulloblastoma (MB), a fast-growing and heterogeneous brain tumor arising in the cerebellum, has been
characterized as four major subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Among the four subgroups, 30-50%
of patients have metastases in the high-risk MBs such as Group 3 and Group 4, particularly Group 3 MB with
MYC amplification or overexpression. Tumor metastases and relapse remain the most significant morbidity
factors influencing MB patient outcomes. Although surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are
effective at eliminating some forms, patients with high-risk MBs cannot be cured with conventional therapies.
Furthermore, unknown molecular mechanisms that regulate tumor metastasis represent a major research gap.
The overall objective of this application is to delineate the functions of SMARCD3 (also named BAF60C) in
neurodevelopment and MB tumorigenesis. We have recently first identified that SMARCD3, a core component
of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, is most highly expressed in Group 3 MB and promotes metastatic
dissemination by hijacking a neurodevelopmental program of Reelin-Disabled 1 (DAB1)-Src kinase signaling.
Based on our published and unpublished data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that MYC upregulates
SMARCD3 expression through enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated chromatin remodeling;
elevated SMARCD3 contributes to MYC-induced MB formation through suppression of P53 transcriptional
expression and to subsequent metastatic dissemination through DAB1-Src signaling- and Lysyl oxidase (LOX)
family-mediated cell migration. Therefore, targeting these signaling pathways provides novel therapeutic
strategies for MB patients. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) delineate
SMARCD3 regulation by MYC-EZH2-mediated chromatin remodeling, 2) determine if SMARCD3 regulates P53
repression contributing to MYC-induced MB formation, and 3) assess the utility of inhibiting SMARCD3-
dependent upregulation of DAB1-Src and LOXL1 signaling activation in preclinical MB models. To accomplish
these aims, we will use genetic gain/loss-of-function methods, transcriptomic/epigenomic approaches, and
pharmacological interventions to delineate the regulatory gene networks (MYC, EZH2, SMARCD3, P53, DAB1,
and LOXL1) in early cerebellar development and MB tumorigenesis. We will test each aim hypothesis using
different preclinical model systems (in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo), including patient-derived MB cell lines and
orthotopic xenograft mouse modes, MYC-induced de novo MB mouse models, and genetically engineered
mouse models. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is the first work to understand
the role of SMARCD3 in brain pathophysiology and to develop a novel antimetastatic strategy for brain cancer
therapy. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide compelling functional evidence
of SMARCD3 in brain development and tumorigenesis. Such knowledge has the potential to offer new rationales
for the development of innovative therapies for patients with MB."
10941846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma contributes to chronic absenteeism and learning loss in U.S. school children and respiratory distress is
the leading cause of 9-1-1 calls from schools. When students with asthma experience respiratory distress, an
essential aspect of symptom management is the administration of albuterol sulfate, a short-acting beta agonist.
Despite laws allowing students to self-carry albuterol inhalers in all 50 U.S. states, access to life-saving
medications for emergency respiratory distress during school hours remains limited. This issue has far-
reaching consequences, contributing to chronic absenteeism and increased healthcare utilization. However, a
stock inhaler program that allows schools to maintain a single inhaler for use by any student who experiences
respiratory distress is a low-cost solution. The Stock Albuterol for Every “SAFE” School Program is a school-
based stock albuterol program in the state of Arizona. Although the program has shown effectiveness,
challenges in its implementation persist, particularly in rural areas. The innovation here lies in exploring three
implementation strategies that vary in their intensity and resource requirements to support program adoption,
maintenance potential, implementation fidelity, student reach and effectiveness. The first two of these
implementation strategies (toolkit, toolkit+nurse coach) have been widely used in Arizona schools and the
third (toolkit+practice facilitation+nurse coach), which includes practice facilitation, is hypothesized to
increase program adoption and implementation maintenance. We aim to adapt the nursing principles of
practice facilitation to a school-based stock albuterol program. By conducting a Hybrid Effectiveness
Implementation (HEI) Type 3 Design, this research aims to provide evidence-based recommendations,
including relative cost-effectiveness of the individual and combined strategies that can be applied in the other
17 additional U.S. states with stock inhaler laws. The proposed research represents a significant opportunity to
empower policymakers, healthcare providers, and educators to improve student health and safety, ultimately
bridging the gap in access to life-saving medications and safeguarding the well-being of our youth."

10930156,"Project Summary
Eye development is governed by complicated networks of gene regulatory elements, but the field has not
yet characterized or even identified most of the regulatory sequences involved. This project will use new
comparative genomics approaches to reveal hundreds of regulatory regions in the genome crucial to eye
development and function. The project first aims to precisely identify chromosomal regions that are
conserved in sighted species’ genomes but lost or deteriorating in six blind species with regressed eye
structures. Those blind species are 3 unrelated species with the common name “mole”, 2 unrelated “mole-
rats”, and a blind river dolphin. This aim will be achieved using powerful RERconverge software
developed in the Clark and Chikina labs that exploits the phenomenon of convergent evolution to discover
genomic regions unique to species sharing a trait, in this case, blindness. Top-scoring regions will then
be assayed for expression in the eye and other tissues in a zebrafish model of embryonic development
using their sequences from mouse. The second aim will determine the functional consequences of
sequence evolution in species with regressed eyesight. To this end, sequences from blind species will
be contrasted with sequences from their sighted ancestor using experimental characterization of
embryonic expression and genome-wide patterns of open chromatin, as well as through recently
introduced computational models. By studying the sequence changes in blind species, specific
subsequences important for ocular expression will be identified. In the third aim, the project will determine
if these new ocular regions are responsible for congenital eye diseases in human patients. Patients for
whom no causal mutation was found will be sequenced at thousands of conserved, non-coding regions
that surfaced from our evolutionary and functional analyses for eye function. Since causal mutations are
not identified in a majority of cases for most eye diseases, associations between disease and these newly
discovered ocular regulatory regions would explain this deficit and allow more comprehensive diagnosis
in the clinic. Furthermore, eye regulatory regions identified in this project will provide the field of gene
therapy with new sequences and expression patterns to design safer and more precise therapies. Thus,
this project directly addresses the mission of the National Eye Institute by providing avenues to better
diagnosis and treatment of genetic eye diseases."

The overall goal of this multisite, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial is to adapt and test a tele-collaborative
care intervention for chronic pain with veterans living in rural areas. During the 1-year UG3 phase, we will
apply evidence-based quality improvement strategies to adapt our tele-collaborative pain care intervention for
implementation across four geographically diverse VA health care facilities; pilot test and refine recruitment,
intervention and data collection protocols at study sites; and, in collaboration with the Pain Management
Collaboratory Coordinating Center, develop standard operating procedures for all activities to be conducted in
the UH3 clinical trial phase. Engagement panels will inform adaptation of the intervention and all components
of the methods of the clinical trial. During the 4-year UH3 phase, we will implement and evaluate the
intervention among rural veterans with high impact chronic pain in a 12-month pragmatic effectiveness trial.
We plan to recruit 152 veterans from each of four clinical sites (total N=608), diverse in terms of birth sex, race,
and ethnicity. Participants will be randomized to receive either tele-collaborative pain care or minimally
enhanced usual care. The intervention is based on the collaborative care model and includes an initial
biopsychosocial chronic pain assessment with a nurse care manager, follow-up, and participation in a pain
education group. The nurse care manager will receive consultation from a pain physician and participants may
be referred for nonpharmacologic and complementary and integrative health treatments for chronic pain. The
nurse care manager will also follow up with rural veterans and help them navigate care across VA and
community health services. We hypothesize that rural veterans who receive tele-collaborative pain care,
relative to minimally enhanced usual care, will evidence decreased pain severity and interference, increased
physical functioning and quality of life, decreased mental health symptom severity and suicidal ideation and
behavior, improved sleep, and increased utilization of nonpharmacologic and complementary and integrative
health pain treatments. We further hypothesize that treatment effects will persist across female vs. male rural
veterans and those who identify as white non-Hispanic vs. minoritized race or ethnicity. Finally, we will conduct
an implementation process evaluation and an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis to inform development of
an implementation toolkit. Study results will inform the future rollout of tele-collaborative pain care for rural
veterans nationally."

 The goals of this R01 Supplemental award are to: 1) find common and distinct themes of degeneration
 and neuroprotection in the family of polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders; and 2) enhance the professional
 and scientific training of Dr. Oluwademilae Nuga, postdoctoral fellow in the Todi laboratory at Wayne
State University School of Medicine.
The polyQ family comprises nine incurable diseases: Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17,
Huntington's disease (arguably the most famous member of the family), Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy
and Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (also known as Kennedy's Disease). Much has been learned about
the biology of disease in the polyQ family, yet we lack therapeutic interventions in the clinic, indicating that we
still have much to learn about mechanisms underscoring them. Here, we propose to conduct unbiased and hy-
pothesis-targeted studies in mammalian cells and in Drosophila models of disease to uncover common themes
of disturbance at the cellular and animal level. The work that we propose seeks to enhance ongoing research
in the Todi lab, funded under R01NS086778 (2014-2028).
Specifically, the studies outlined for the two year timeframe of this proposal will use RNA-Seq and unbiased
proteomics from cells stably expressing full-length, wild type and disease-causing polyQ proteins to undertake
an unprecedented “birds-eye view” of shared and distinct mechanisms of degeneration. Unbiased studies will
then be conceptualized into targeted hypotheses to confirm and extend them in animal models of disease and
in patient-derived iNeuronal cells. The Todi lab recently completed the generation of a unique, unprecedented
family of isogenic Drosophila lines that express the wild-type or pathogenic version of each polyQ protein that
Dr. Nuga will use in this proposal.
Alongside the scientific work, Dr. Nuga will undergo thorough mentoring for further scientific and professional
growth, ensuring that by the end of this proposal she is very well positioned to apply for a K99/R00 award fo-
cused on her own data, which she can then build towards an independent career in academia."

This training program prepares pre-doctoral & post-doctoral trainees for careers where they will invent the
physics and engineering of new tools and techniques that will lead to discoveries in cancer research and in the
management of cancer patients. The research specializations cover a broad range of technologies in disease
diagnosis, personalized treatment and delivery assessment, with the core focus being applied medical physics
research in cancer. The 34 faculty mentors with another 22 participating faculty in the core departments include
Medical Physics, Radiology, Human Oncology (Radiation Oncology), Physics and Electrical Engineering faculty,
who have a broad spectrum of collaborations with other clinical and basic science researchers. Translational,
team-driven research includes traditional x-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, optical and PET/SPECT imaging with the
Department of Radiology, and radiation physics, radiation biology, and radiation therapy with the Department of
Human Oncology. Trainees are intimate participants in these research programs as collaborators, publishing
joint research articles, and learning the skill to apply for extramurally funded grants and contracts. Extensive
faculty contact provides leadership and supervision, including weekly lunch visits with visiting colloquia faculty.
Pre-doctoral trainees in Medical Physics take two years of didactic medical physics training progressively
oriented towards their research specialization, and are typically voted into this training program after passing
their oral qualifier, with a preliminary research plan related to cancer. This design has significantly increased the
likelihood of their remaining in cancer-related research and shortens their typical time in the NRSA position to 2
years, funded both before and after by their primary advisor. Post-doctoral trainees are encouraged to broaden
and deepen their academic training by auditing appropriate courses, and their appointments are typically 2 years.
Both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees must take or audit additional research ethics courses, take cancer-
specific courses, attend relevant cancer grand rounds presentations, and must participate in a newly created
course on the PhD Scientist Profession, including instruction on patenting, business startups, grant writing,
career guidance and one-on-one mentoring. Trainees give seminars, attend colloquia, present research results
at local, national, and international meetings, and co-author articles and reports. An annual Training Grant
Symposium provides additional opportunity for trainees to present research results to the Medical Physics and
collaborating faculty. Additionally, a newly created biennial Symposium/Workshop on Emerging Leaders of
Academic Medical Physics includes their participation with networking, diversity building and ideation of research
vision. The program benefits from an external advisory board of T32 directors in medical imaging and cancer,
as well as active participation by 16 physician-scientists. Trainees in the program are exceptionally well prepared
to assume leadership positions as visionary researchers and academics in the application of physics to cancer
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."

The Rapid Case Ascertainment Shared Resource (RCA) was originally developed in 1986-1987 in response to
a Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) request to establish a single entity that would be responsible for all
population-based cancer epidemiology studies that directly involve Connecticut hospitals. As YCC members’
needs to support non-therapeutic trials and research projects have increased, RCA has broadened and
expanded its scope to provide support to YCC investigators in their non-therapeutic studies. This includes YCC
members who conduct projects through the Veteran’s Health Administration (VHA).
RCA assists cancer researchers in implementing and executing their studies by providing high-quality and cost-
effective study management, cancer case identification, patient enrollment and interview, medical record
abstraction, and specimen collection services so that investigators can accomplish their scientific goals. During
FY2022, there were 28 RCA users. 23 of these users (82%) were YCC members, representing all six Research
Programs. The Rapid Case Ascertainment Shared Resource (RCA) also facilitates cancer research and
population-based studies of cancer for YCC investigators, as well as outside ones, who wish to conduct research
in the state of Connecticut (YCC catchment area). RCA addresses the many administrative tasks common to all
proposed hospital-based research in the state and provides a uniformly high-quality, well-coordinated interface
with those individuals, institutions, and agencies crucial to the success of cancer research. RCA also supports
rapid cancer case identification for research and clinical purposes, and functions as an agent of the Connecticut

Perform data collection and pathology specimen collection; (7) Manage blood and other specimen collections
(i.e., stool, cerebral spinal fluid, biopsy cores) within the YCC/Smilow Network; (8) Facilitate research across the
state of CT (YCC catchment area), as well as targeting areas of higher cancer risk (e.g., cities of Hartford, New
Haven. and Bridgeport)."
10934052,"YALE PATHOLOGY TISSUE SERVICES SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Yale Pathology Tissue Services (YPTS) is committed to providing the maximum amount and quality of human
tissue for research at Yale Cancer Center and Yale University without impacting diagnostic quality, accuracy,
and safety in anatomic pathology. YPTS, established in 2007, based in the Department of Pathology, serves as
a shared resource for YCC. The resource includes 3 divisions that work together to provide a full range of tissue
services: Tissue Distribution and Analysis (TDA), Developmental Histology and Tissue Microarrays (DH-TMA),
and Clinical Trials Tissue Services (CTTS).
The Tissue Distribution and Analysis (TDA) has about 40 active standard operating procedures (SOPs) for tissue
acquisition, over half of which provide tissue to members of YCC including a series of federated tissue banks
including specific disease-focused biorepositories for the Lung and HNSCC SPORE biobanks. Two of these
SOPs are for the new Yale Biobank (a new University-wide, centrally supported tissue bank expected to replace
the federated tissue banking system in the future). We anticipate that over the next 5 years the federated
disease-specific biorepositories will transition to the central Yale University Centralized Biobank with more
streamlined tissue collection SOPs. The TDA division also provides slide scanning and quantitative analysis
services for Yale investigators.
The Developmental Histology (DH) division provides comprehensive human and animal histology services,
including chromogenic immunohistochemistry, bespoke fixation and processing, frozen sections, TMA
construction and distribution and access to the Yale Pathology archives for historical diagnostic tissue. DH/TMA
has nearly 600 master blocks, some with as many as 20 replicates, and distributes around 50,000 TMA slides
per year.
Clinical Trials Tissue Services (CTTS) provides rapid access to FFPE tissue for patient enrollment in trials
requiring tissue samples both within Yale and for outside institutions.
The YPTS resource has been directed by David Rimm, MD, PhD, since 2007 and he has a 5-member leadership
team that help manage 15 FTEs. The services are ordered online and create an auditable record of operations
supported by a dedicated computational programmer from the Department of Pathology’s IT unit. The software
was built at Yale and is maintained and updated by the computational supervisor (Sudha Kumar) including
“eHisto”, the tissue and services ordering and accounting system and “Aquamine”, a PHI-free database allowing
public access to data obtained from TMAs and whole slide cohorts available from YPTS."
10935439,"Project Summary/Abstract
HPV is a necessary cause of 10% of all cancers of women globally, including 99% of cervical cancers. Rates of
cervical cancer vary markedly by geographic region and level of economic development, with >85% occurring in
developing countries. Global estimates of HPV vaccination delivery and cervical screening by region and income
level show virtually none in many poorer populations. There are 13 mucosal high-risk (hr) HPV types plus 11
possibly carcinogenic types. Licensed HPV vaccines all target HPV16 and HPV18, and one (Gardasil®9) also
targets the next five most common types in cervical cancer. Since none target all cancer-associated HPVs,
screening is maintained even in vaccinated women, adding to medical costs. Further, the stringent cold-chain
and ≥two dose requirements for HPV vaccines are a serious impediment to delivery in developing countries. Our
overall goal is to develop an affordable HPV vaccine that durably extends the breadth of protection to all cancer-
associated HPV types, needs only to be administered once, and is stable at ambient temperature. Here we
address this goal with two innovations: 1) displaying an L2-based protective epitope (RG1, that is conserved for
HPVs) in a unique position on the surface of HPV16 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs), producing a single antigen,
broadly protective HPV vaccine technology, RG1-VLP, and 2) the RG1-VLP vaccine is formulated by freeze
drying in a glassy organic matrix surrounded by single atomic layer deposits of Al2O3. This atomic layer deposition
(ALD) technology confers heat stability, protects against degradation during delivery, and provides slow waves
antigen release that potentially allows for a single dose regimen.
HYPOTHESIS 1: Repeat dosing with alum-formulated RG1-VLP vaccine is safe and immunogenic. Specific
Aim 1: To perform a dose escalation phase I trial of the safety and immunogenicity of RG1-VLP absorbed
to alum in healthy female volunteers.
HYPOTHESIS 2: RG1-VLP vaccination of healthy women induces cross-reactive serum antibody that broadly
protects via neutralizing antibodies and Fc-mediated phagocytosis. Specific Aim 2: To analyze the levels of
protection against intravaginal HPV challenge conferred by passive transfer of serum of patients
vaccinated with either RG1-VLP or Gardasil®9 in mice with fully humanized Fc receptors or none.
This clinical study employs RG1-VLP antigen mixed with alum adjuvant, a conventional approach that requires
refrigeration during delivery and storage and a repeat dose vaccination regimen.
HYPOTHESIS 3: Cold chain, continued Pap screening and multidosing needs are significant barriers to global
HPV vaccine programs, and the development of a thermostable atomic-layered deposition (ALD) coated RG1-
VLP vaccine will address these issues. Specific Aim 3: Develop an ALD coated RG1-VLP vaccine, study its
in vitro temperature stability, and in murine models test its one dose immunogenicity and protective
efficacy and breadth of coverage in comparison to standard regimen Gardasil®9 vaccination."
10935388,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT of Project 1
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death, and it disproportionately impacts African
American people whose CRC mortality rate is 40% higher than the US average. Given this and the rising rates
of early-onset CRC, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups, we need new approaches to identify
individuals at higher risk who could benefit from precision screening strategies. Currently, only family history is
used to identify individuals who should undergo earlier and more frequent screening; however, over 80% of CRC
are diagnosed in people without a family history of CRC, suggesting that we need more comprehensive and
tailored ways to stratify individuals according to their risk. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), which aggregate
all CRC-associated genetic variants into a single score to predict CRC risk, we can identify high risk subgroups
from the general population who are currently considered average-risk but who would likely benefit from targeted
prevention and screening interventions. However, arguably one of the most critical ethical and scientific
challenges related to this is the fact that current PRS are substantially more effective in predicting risk in non-
Hispanic White individuals due to the consequences of the Euro-centric bias present in genetic research. A
promising strategy to address this is the use of functional genomic data to guide PRS development, which we
propose in Aim 1. We will derive functional genomic scores from single cell data for chromatin accessibility and
gene-expression for each cell type and state relevant to CRC (Aim 1a). In Aim 1b we will use machine learning
methods to incorporate the functional genomic scores to build and validate PRS based on data from the largest
and most racially and ethnically diverse genetic epidemiologic consortium (123,000 CRC cases and 228,000
controls, including 45,000 cases and 121,000 controls who do not identify as non-Hispanic White). As an increasing
number of companies are offering PRS direct to consumers, we urgently need to evaluate the clinical value of
PRS for risk stratified CRC screening. Therefore, we will use the microsimulation model MISCAN to quantify the
distributional cost-effectiveness of PRS for risk stratification and estimate the optimal screening strategy in terms
of equity and efficiency based on the PRS across a racially and ethnically diverse population (Aim 2). Our team
is ideally positioned to lead this effort given we discovered most of the common genetic risk factors for CRC,
have a strong track record conducting single cell multi-omic data analyses, developed comprehensive risk
prediction models using cutting edge machine learning approaches, and have a successful history of working
with community advisors. To promote the translation of a novel PRS that performs well across different racial
and ethnic groups, we deliberately focus on increasing diversity in genetic studies of CRC and will make data
and our models publicly available. As PRS are increasingly entering clinical care, our findings will address key
cancer disparities as we seek to improve CRC prevention by guiding personalizing interventions that will reduce
the burden of CRC across racial and ethnic groups."
10935389,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are appreciable and continue to persist in the
United States particularly among Alaska Native and African American people. To address these disparities, we
propose a CRC tumor molecular profiling strategy that will provide novel insights and take full advantage of the
existing infrastructure of our Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities (TRPCD) with its
available biospecimens from highly annotated CRC patients. Specifically, novel spatial proteomic analyses
enable deep characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immune response which in other cancers has
been shown to be of high translational relevance. Few studies though have applied this powerful approach to
CRC or to advance our understanding of cancer disparities through studying patients from racially and ethnically
diverse populations. Using data and biospecimens from African American, Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-
Hispanic White CRC patients this project will complete the following specific aims: Aim 1. Discover novel
colorectal tumor-tissue based spatially resolved prognostic biomarkers using the PhenoCycler platform (n=840);
Aim 2. Discover colorectal tumor tissue based spatially resolved predictors of response to both first-line CRC
therapy (n=840) and immunotherapy (n=100); Aim 3. Develop and validate predictors of treatment response and
CRC-specific mortality. This aim will use 70% of samples for discovery, and 30% for validation. Our optimized
panel to predict risk of CRC-specific mortality will be translated into a multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) ~8
biomarker assay (using the Vectra Polaris platform) and its performance will be evaluated on our 30% validation
set. The results of this work will have short-term potential translational impacts through improving the
identification of: 1) patients at high risk of dying from CRC who may benefit from advanced monitoring or
alternative first-line treatments, including the development of the first version of a potentially clinically useful mIF
assay; and 2) predictors of treatment response that can guide clinical decision making, treatment selection, and
patient stratification. Our comprehensive evaluations of tumoral immune response and mechanism of immune
evasion may have longer-term potential translational impact as they could inform the development of novel
therapeutic approaches that could be particularly relevant for certain racial and ethnic groups. We anticipate that
through identifying new treatment strategies and improving risk prediction across different racial and ethnic
groups, this project will have a positive impact on reducing long-standing disparities in CRC outcomes."
10935390,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality vary greatly by race and ethnicity in the United States (US).
Alaska Native people have among the highest reported rates of CRC in the world; African American people also
shoulder an elevated burden of CRC compared to other groups in the US. This disproportionate burden of CRC
is marked by differences in the distribution of clinicopathologic factors (e.g., tumor site, age at CRC onset,
consensus molecular subtypes) by race and ethnicity, which also has implications for outcomes. In exploring
factors that may contribute to these observed disparities, minimal consideration has been paid to the potential
contribution of the microbiome. The presence of a gut microbial community is common across all human
populations, but the composition of that community varies greatly – by sex, diet, and race and ethnicity. The
composition of the gut microbiome has plausible implications for a variety of pertinent health outcomes, including
CRC. Increasing evidence indicates that specific gut bacteria, or imbalances in bacterial populations, could play
a role in the natural history of CRC. Prior studies have implicated a small number of candidate bacteria (e.g.,
Fusobacterium nucleatum; Fn) as contributors to CRC etiology and survival; however, our early studies suggest
these candidates are unlikely to be significant contributors to CRC disparities. Instead, we are identifying novel
candidate bacteria that are disproportionately prevalent in tumors among Alaska Native and African American
patients with CRC. The objective of this project is to test our overarching hypothesis that specific racial and
ethnic differences in the tumor microbiome contribute to disparities in CRC attributes and outcomes. In pursuit
of this objective, we will leverage and build upon existing biospecimen and data resources, infrastructure, and
preliminary findings accumulated through the Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities
(TRPCD). In Aim 1, using quantitative digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assays, we will: (1a) test for differences in
the prevalence and abundance of novel candidate bacteria in colorectal tumors across four racial and ethnic
groups (Alaska Native, African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White patients with CRC), and (1b) test
for associations with risk of lethal CRC overall and within racial and ethnic groups. For Aim 2, we will expand
our evaluation of (2a) these novel candidates and (2b) microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S rRNAseq)
data to examine relationships with clinicopathologic factors, with a focus on attributes that differ in their
distribution across racial and ethnic groups and have implications for outcomes. In Aim 3, we will use artificial
intelligence, such as machine learning strategies, to identify tumor-associated microbial signatures in CRC
associated with CRC-specific mortality and will assess differences in the distribution of those signatures by race
and ethnicity. Integration of the results from our aims can be used to inform more targeted cancer treatment
strategies, particularly in understudied populations experiencing the greatest burden of CRC."
10936333,"Resident microbiota influence physiologic responses in many organs and are linked to many inflammatory,
metabolic, neoplastic and behavioral disorders. Altered microbiota (dysbiosis) is associated with these
conditions by vastly improved deep sequencing, metabolomic and analytic techniques. However, functional
consequences, the primary vs. secondary nature of these compositional changes and role of individual
bacterial species and combinations remain unknown. These functional properties are mechanistically
addressed in gnotobiotic mice by precisely manipulating the microbiota in selectively colonized germ-free (GF)
wild-type and genetically-engineered inbred mice with single or multiple resident or pathogenic microbial
strains. Fecal microbial transplants (FMT) transfer healthy or diseased human or experimental animal’s fecal
microbiota to GF mice to explore functional properties of dysbiotic complex bacterial communities. However,
microbial and clinical heterogeneity between individuals with human complex disease are enormous and
greatly affect FMT results. Most investigators use single or small numbers of fecal donors for FMT, leading to
marked variability in results from different human donors. An important unmet research need is an easily
accessible source of broadly representative and fully characterized human fecal samples for colonizing GF
mice t achieve consistent reproducible results. Human FMT into gnotobiotic mice is a popular approach to test
in vivo functional properties of dysbiotic bacterial communities from diseased patients and enhance clinical
relevance of murine preclinical therapeutic models. We show low efficiency transfer of human fecal bacteria to
GF mice, but enhanced transfer efficiency with this material from the murine recipient to another GF mouse.
Transplant of this mouse-adapted (MA) human microbiota to other mice yields more reproducible colitis than
did FMT of the original pooled human fecal samples, but with retention of the transferred human phenotype.
Other uncertainties that limit reproducibility of human FMT to GF mice are the variable methods of fecal
microbial transfer; frequency of administration, duration of equilibration after shipping mice prior to FMT, since
most of our users do not have local gnotobiotic facilities to maintain sterility after receiving our mice, and type
of housing after transfer. Carefully dissecting these variables will develop optimal protocols for handling and
housing mice before and after FMT. We hypothesize that human fecal bacterial transfer to GF mice can be
improved by optimizing transfer techniques and transferring fully characterized mouse-adapted pooled human
fecal transplants into gnotobiotic inbred mice will yield highly reproducible results and stable phenotypes in
recipient mice. Aim: Improve fecal transfer techniques, optimize housing conditions for recipient mice
and characterize pooled complex mouse-adapted human fecal microbial communities from healthy
donors and those with several high-profile diseases to create FMT methods and a repository that
achieves highly reproducible results for our users."
10943105,"This new R01 proposal assembles a team with expertise in tumor immunology and immunotherapy, mouse
cancer models, melanoma, IFN-I signals, tumor signaling, single cell spatial omics and novel statistical
approaches. We developed an autochthonous melanoma model to generate tumors from melanoma cells of
origin (melanocytes) that are PDL1KO or CTRL and bear the NrasQ61R mutation. Our overarching hypothesis
is that UVB elicits local and systemic melPDL1-dependent IFN-I production that promotes melanoma
progression and treatment resistance through tumor inflammatory memory.
General approaches. We compare outcomes of melanocyte PDL1 (melPDL1) expression on tumor immune
surveillance and TME composition and tumor progression in autochthonous melanomas induced ± UVB.
Transplantable tumor lines from autochthonous tumors will be genetically engineered and used in distinct hosts
to test tumor signal effects mediating relevant outcomes to confirm mechanisms. These outcomes will be
compared to data from human materials to validate human relevance.
Aim 1 Test the hypothesis that UVB-induced IFN-I elicits melPDL1-dependent inflammatory memory.
CTRL versus melPDL1KO mT/mG TNQ61R mice (with a melanocyte EGFP reporter) will be induced ± UVB. TME
effects will be assessed by spectral flow cytometry, RPPA, bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and spatial imaging
approaches. Cell-cell interactions are tested by COMMOT and confocal imaging. IFN-I effects are tested by
αIFNAR and IFN-I quantification. Effects on tumor-specific immunity use pmel cells with gene reporters or
IFNARKO for cell effector function and trafficking assays. Outcomes include tumor inflammatory memory, latency
and growth control. Detailed mechanisms are interrogated with transplantable lines from autochthonous tumors
engineered to test specific molecules and pathways. Human relevance is confirmed in human tissues.
Aim 2 Test the hypothesis that acute UVB affects later melanoma treatment responses. Effects of UVB
and IFN-I on treatment resistance (e.g., through tumor inflammatory memory versus alternatives) are assessed
with immune checkpoint blockade and selected small molecule inhibitors. Mechanisms are defined using above
approaches. Cutaneous UVB and IFN-I effects on metastatic sites (tumor draining lymph nodes, lungs) will be
elucidated and preliminary studies done, but logistics prevent full detailed mechanistic studies. Metastases are
tracked by imaging and identified in RNA-seq data sets using mT/mG mice. Novel statistical analytic approaches
are used for all outcomes, especially scRNAseq and spatial imaging."
10943173,"Sphingolipid metabolites are recently emerging as important lipid signaling molecules. Among them,
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is known to play critical roles in cellular processes in various organ systems
including kidneys. S1P receptor (S1PR)1, S1PR2 and S1PR3 as well as S1P-producing enzymes are detected
in the kidneys. S1P system plays important roles in the pathogenesis of many kidney diseases. However, little
is known about the role of the S1P system in renal Na+ excretion. We have recently shown that S1P receptors
are prominently expressed in the renal medulla; S1P is a novel diuretic factor in the renal medulla and regulates
Na+ excretion via the activation of S1PR1 receptor; S1PR1 in collecting duct is an important antihypertensive
pathway by promoting sodium excretion and that impairment of renal medullary S1PR1 contributes to salt-
sensitive hypertension. These studies suggest important roles of renal S1P system in salt-sensitive hypertension.
Our previous studies focused on S1PR1 receptor. Apparently, levels of S1P production would play critical roles
in the function of S1P system. However, whether enzymes that produce S1P participate in the control of Na+
excretion and blood pressure has not been investigated. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that among the
enzymes that are responsible for the S1P production, acid ceramidase (AC) as the rate-limit enzyme was
significantly increased after high salt intake and inhibited in DOCA-salt hypertension. Moreover, infusion of AC
inhibitor into renal medulla and knockout of AC in collecting ducts inhibited sodium excretion and increased salt
sensitivity of blood pressure. Based on the above information, the central hypothesis is that high salt-induced
AC-S1P pathway in the renal medulla is a novel mechanism to promote the excretion of extra Na+ load and that
suppression of renal medullary AC-S1P pathway contributes to the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.
Mechanistically, we characterized the expressions of candidate transcription factors and found that Activating
Protein 2α (AP2A) was increased after high salt intake and present in the collecting ducts. It is therefore proposed
that AP2A is the upstream signal to activate the expression of AC. Indeed, our preliminary data showed that
transfection of AP2A shRNA into the renal medulla blocked the high salt-induced AC expression and that the
high salt-induced AP2A was suppressed in DOCA-salt mice. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: To test
the hypothesis that activation of AC-S1P pathway mediates the excretion of extra sodium load and that inhibition
of AC-S1P pathway in the renal medulla impairs renal Na+ handling, thereby enhancing salt sensitivity of blood
pressure. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the deficiency of AC-S1P pathway contributes to the pathogenesis
of salt-sensitive hypertension in DOCA-salt model. Aim 3: To determine the mechanisms causing the deficiency
of AC pathway: test the hypothesis that impairment of transcription factor AP2A leads to the suppression of AC
levels in the renal medulla in DOCA-salt hypertension. The proposed studies will reveal a novel molecular
mechanism in renal Na+ handling and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension."
10942710,"Project Summary
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is characterized by attenuated capacities to recognize and interpret the emotional
states of others. Extant cross-sectional studies have described these deficits and confirm their association with
interpersonal difficulties. However, no current data adequately inform the capacity for change in emotion
processing during early abstinence, the putative cognitive/affective mechanisms underlying such change, or
resultant impacts on treatment adherence, relapse, or other clinically-relevant recovery outcomes. The proposed
project addresses these three critical gaps.
The fundamental approach involves longitudinal assessment of emotion processing from treatment initiation to
discharge (~3 months). We will recruit recently-abstinent individuals in residential treatment for AUD. We will
also recruit a matched sample of community controls, facilitating characterization of practice effects. In addition
to longitudinal collection of emotion processing performance, indexed via multimodal computerized assessment
tasks, we will also interrogate non-affective cognitive functions (e.g., inhibitory control) and intrapersonal
measures of affect processing (e.g., emotion regulation). In addition to surveillance of treatment adherence (e.g.,
dropout, readmission), treatment outcome indices will be provided by both patients and clinicians, and will include
post-discharge assessments of functioning (e.g., quality of life; resumption of use).
We will delineate the growth function(s) indexing change in social cognition over the first three months of
abstinence, allowing us to test the hypothesis that these functions improve, as well as describe what constitutes
normal vs. maladaptive rates of recovery. We will employ statistical models facilitating causal inference to test
the hypotheses that alterations in executive functions, intrapersonal affect processing, and mood constitute
underlying mechanisms of AUD-associated deficits in interpersonal emotion processing. We will test the
hypothesis that change in emotion processing will drive subsequent improvements in a range of clinically-
relevant outcomes, and examine putative mediators (e.g., social support) of these relationships.
Execution of the proposed project will provide actionable data guiding identification of at-risk patients for whom
intervention may be most impactful, as well as critical periods for intervention delivery. Results will directly
contribute to the development of interventions designed to enhance emotion processing by facilitating selection
of the most appropriate mechanistic targets. Resulting data will determine the breadth and magnitude of
clinically-relevant recovery outcomes impacted, facilitating estimation of potential intervention efficacy.
Our laboratory has the requisite experience to execute these aims, the ongoing relationships with treatment
facilities required to collect the data, and the expertise to translate findings into social cognitive interventions."
10942787,"SUMMARY
The somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SSTR2) is expressed in 80-100% of NETs. SSTR2 targeted alpha-emitter
radioligand therapy (α-RLT) is emerging as an exciting alternative to beta-emitter radiopharmaceuticals due to
the higher linear energy transfer and dense ionization tracks that result in enhanced formation of double stranded
DNA (dsDNA) damage with up to 80% tumor response rates in early clinical studies. However, preclinical studies
show that α-RLTs can cause a dose dependent late nephrotoxicity characterized by late tubular injury, fibrosis,
and inflammation. Building on recent breakthrough from our group we will test the overall hypothesis that
[212Pb]Pb-VMT-α-NET (212Pb-VMT) tumor responses can be maximized through a treatment scheme that
incorporates biomarkers of tubular injury, dosimetry, dose fractionation, and a nephroprotective superoxide
dismutase mimetic to mitigate nephrotoxicity. In Aim 1, we will develop a detailed understanding of the role of
superoxide dismutation in tubular dsDNA repair following [212Pb]Pb-VMT-α-NET treatment. In Aim 2, we will
identify [212Pb]Pb-VMT-α-NET dosing regimens to achieve maximal tumor responses and reduce nephrotoxicity
using a superoxide dismutase mimetic. We will incorporate the following innovative methods: (1) a novel α-RLT
[203Pb/212Pb]Pb-VMT-α-NET theranostic pair targeting SSTR2; (2) innovative SSTR2 expressing tumor models;
(3) urine biomarkers for non-invasive detection of tubular injury; (4) dsDNA injury/repair tools to study mechanism
of early subclinical tubular dsDNA damage following α -RLT; and (5) a novel nephrotoxicity mitigation strategy
based on superoxide scavenging that shows promising tumor response improvement to external beam radiation.
If successful, we expect these findings and advances be transferable to a broad range of α-RLTs, not only for
pancreatic NETs and neuroblastoma, but also for prostate, breast, melanomas, and other difficult to treat cancers
amenable to α-RLT."
10941882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our proposed research employs innovative, unbiased approaches and novel preclinical models to elucidate how
disseminated HER2+ breast cancer cells cells survive in the brain microenvironment and initiate metachronous
metastasis.
Through functional characterization of phenotypically stable preclinical models of HER2+ breast cancer brain
metastasis, we discovered latent/dormant (Lat) HER2+ cells display stem cell-like characteristics, downregulate
immune activating sensors and survive in equilibrium with innate immune surveillance, while brain metastatic
cells escape and metastasize. Moreover, metabolically distinct HER2+ brain-tropic Lat cells and metachronous
brain metastatic (M-BM) cells are resistant to radiation and systemic HER2 targeted therapies. AXL, a
member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptor tyrosine kinase family is enriched in Lat and M-BMs. AXL
expression is enriched in metachronous brain metastatic lesions compared to matched primary tumors from
HER2+ breast cancer patients. Of note, AXL is predominantly nuclear in these brain metastatic lesions and
in our preclinical brain metastatic model systems. CRISPR affinity purification of in situ regulatory elements
revealed enrichment of TEAD transcription factor at the AXL promoter region in Lat and M-BMs. AXL
immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis identified WRN Helicase Interacting Protein 1 (WRNIP1)
among other nuclear proteins that interact with AXL. WRNIP1 aids maintenance of genomic stability under
replicative stress and promotes survival of Lat and M-BM cells. Depletion of AXL in Lat and M-BM cells or
administration of small molecule AXL inhibitor (BGB324) results in attenuated metastasis initiating
capacity. Noticeably, increased AXL expression and reduced cytotoxicity was also observed in tumor
trained/exposed NK cells, while administration of BGB324 to augmented cytotoxicity.
Thus, our central hypothesis is therapy resistant brain-tropic HER2+ breast cancer cells are dependent
on nuclear AXL signaling response for survival and membranous AXL expression in NK cell results in
dysfunction. The proposed aims will delineate how TEAD signaling response promotes brain metastasis and
assess the impact of AXL inhibitors in limiting tumor cell survival and reactivating NK mediated innate immune
surveillance."
10943887,"The ability to regenerate complex, multi-lineage organs remains one of the key challenges in regenerative
medicine. Many mammalian organs, including the heart, digit tip, and skin, retain some ability to regenerate after
damage during neonatal or fetal development, but the ability to regenerate decreases dramatically as the animal
develops. Elucidating the mechanistic basis of this differential regenerative capacity is key to understanding the
principles of regenerative control and laying the foundation for therapeutic reactivation of regeneration after injury.
To this end, we propose to determine the genetic and molecular basis of scarless, multi-lineage regeneration
after fetal skin injury. Healing of full-thickness injuries to postnatal skin is accompanied by fibrosis (scar
formation), but injuries to fetal skin heal without scar formation, a phenomenon that has fascinated biologists for
decades, but the mechanisms behind these differences remain poorly understood.
 We have overcome three technical hurdles and are now uniquely positioned to take on this challenge: (1)
We have developed a robust surgical procedure to conduct wounding in fetal mice in utero. (2) We have
optimized a cell isolation protocol to collect sufficient cells for single-cell RNA and ATAC analyses from wounded
tissues. (3) We have established a strategy for rapid, in vivo genetic manipulation directly in wild-type mice by
delivering targeted genetic cargo with viral vectors. Together, these approaches will enable us to identify and
assay a relatively large number of genes in vivo for their involvement in either regeneration or scar formation.
Furthermore, we have substantial preliminary data suggesting that injuries in fetal skin (E16.5) are healed with
regeneration of diverse cell types from multiple lineages—hair follicles, innervations, blood and lymphatic vessels,
and diverse dermal cell types—resulting in skin that is morphologically similar to unwounded skin. By contrast,
these cell types fail to regenerate properly upon postnatal injury. We have also already identified one candidate
factor—CXCL12, a postnatal wound-specific secreted factor, that inhibits regeneration when overexpressed in
fetal skin.
 Building on this foundation, we propose to create comprehensive cellular and molecular atlases of fetal
vs. postnatal wound healing processes using a single-cell multiomic approach (combining single-cell RNAseq
and single-cell ATACseq) to assess both transcriptome and chromatin changes in the same single-cell. We will
then determine if the reduction of CXCL12 in postnatal wounds promotes regeneration. We will also
systematically test additional secreted factors that are unique to either fetal or postnatal wounds in their ability
to drive or inhibit multilineage regeneration in the skin. Collectively, this work will provide critical insights into how
regeneration ability is blocked or lost as an organ develops, open new research directions for studying organ-
level regeneration in mammals, and guide new therapeutic strategies that promote regenerative healing under
challenging conditions including burns and chronic non-healing wounds."

RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) is essential for faithful DNA double-strand break (DSB)
repair and thus safeguards against genome rearrangements, neoplastic cell transformation, and oncogenesis.
During HR initiation, DSBs are processed, yielding ssDNA overhangs that are swiftly coated by Replication
Protein A (RPA) to preserve these DNA overhangs and to activate the DNA damage checkpoint. Several “HR
mediators” play a key role in RPA-RAD51 exchange to help ensure timely assembly of RAD51-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filaments capable of conducting DNA homology search and subsequent strand invasion.
RAD51 paralogs (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3) are HR mediators that assemble into
distinct CX3 (RAD51C-XRCC3) and BCDX2 (RAD51BCD-XRCC2) complexes that mediate RAD51 filament
assembly. Germline mutations in members of these RAD51 paralog complexes give rise to breast, ovarian
and other cancers, and are causative of the cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi anemia. This underscores the
crucial roles of RAD51 paralogs in genome maintenance and tumor suppression.
Despite their fundamental importance to genome integrity and their involvement in cancer susceptibility, little
is known about the mechanisms by which BCDX2 and CX3 serve as mediators of RAD51-dependent HR.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the structural and molecular basis by which the CX3 (Aim 1) and
BCDX2 (Aim 2) promote RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament assembly and how their dysregulation leads
to cancer. Our studies will also shed light on how higher order complexes of CX3 and BCDX2 with partner
proteins, such as PALB2 and HELQ, mediate RPA-RAD51 exchange on ssDNA, confer cellular resistance to
DNA damaging agents, and function in the protection of stress and damaged DNA replication forks against
nucleolytic attrition. Mechanistic questions regarding the molecular roles of these RAD51 paralog complexes
will be answered by our Multi-PI research team through a combination of single particle cryo-EM, single-
molecule DNA curtain assays, together with biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based analyses. We expect
our multidisciplinary, synergistic approach to yield a deeper understanding of how CX3 and BCDX2

 Leukemia represents the most prevalent form of cancer among children. Sequencing studies from
identical twins indicate that the initial genetic alterations can manifest as early as during fetal development. Acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, which is characterized by various genetic alterations
including fusion oncoproteins. NUP98-NSD1 fusion-positive AML is a poor prognostic subtype that is commonly
diagnosed in pediatric patients with cytogenetically normal AML. There, the nuclear pore complex member
NUP98 fuses to the histone methyltransferase NSD1. Recently, NUP98-NSD1 gene fusions, in combination with
transcription factor WT1 (Wilms' tumor 1) mutations, were identified in a chemotherapy resistant pediatric AML
cohort, with a devastating 4-year event-free survival of less than 10%. The underlying reason why NUP98-NSD1
with WT1 mutations are associated with therapy resistance and relapse is not known.
 In preliminary experiments, we created a humanized system of NUP98-NSD1 rearranged leukemia with
endogenous expression of the fusion gene, with and without WT1 loss of function mutations. Strikingly, NUP98-
NSD1 fusion-driven leukemogenesis displayed a developmental dependency, where its expression transforms
pre-natal fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), to a lesser extent post-natal cord blood-derived
HSCs, but unable to transform adult bone marrow-derived HSCs. In vitro, endogenous NUP98-NSD1
oncoprotein conferred clonal selection and proliferation advantage in fetal HSCs, while in vivo, through
xenotransplantation in mice, NUP98-NSD1 faithfully recapitulated AML. Therefore, we hypothesize that the
epigenetic state of fetal-derived HSCs is permissive of NUP98-NSD1-mediated leukemic transformation, but is
repressed in developmental states after birth.
 The overall objective of our project is to define mechanisms of action of NUP98-NSD1 in HSCs across
development, understand how WT1 mutations drive therapy resistance and identify novel therapeutic targets for
NUP98-rearranged leukemia. In Aim 1, we are proposing to investigate the cellular and developmental
dependency of NUP98-NSD1-mediated leukemic initiation by xenotransplantations. We will assess the single-
cell epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of NUP98-NSD1 fusion-positive HSCs across ontogeny. In Aim 2,
we plan to characterize the downstream effects of WT1 mutations in NUP98-rearranged leukemia. We observed
that concurrent WT1 loss led to a more primitive stem cell hierarchy and an enrichment of quiescent leukemic
stem cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we are proposing to identify therapeutic approaches against NUP98-rearranged
leukemia. We will functionally assess the role of candidate genes using our established model and primary PDX
patient samples. Our goal is to characterize novel therapeutic targets for NUP98-rearranged leukemia.
 The proposed research has the potential to change our understanding of why children are susceptible to
NUP98-NSD1 rearranged AML and provide a strong rational for therapeutic intervention in the future."

Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) is a common salivary gland cancer for which there is no standard systemic
therapy. ACC has a heterogeneous behavior; while most patients have an indolent disease course,
approximately 30% have a very aggressive disease. There are currently no standard markers to prognosticate
or for selecting treatment. Epigenetic changes are tightly linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression and
numerous studies imply that DNA methylation may serve as a valuable biomarker to identify molecular disease
subtypes. However, studies evaluating whole ACC methylome and the evolutionary trajectories of methylation
during the initiation and progression of ACC are lacking. We identified methylation intertumor heterogeneity in
ACC and differentially methylated gene regions according to ACC transcriptomic subtype. Additionally, we also
identified circulating tumor DNA in blood of ACC patients and their levels correlated with disease recurrence,
response to therapy or disease progression, suggesting clinical utility of ctDNA dynamics. Our central hypothesis
is that the DNA methylation signature in ACC can identify prognostically distinct and therapeutic relevant
molecular subtypes and circulating methylation markers may be used as a non-invasive tool for real-time
subtyping stratification and treatment monitoring. In Aim 1 we will examine the DNA methylation and
transcriptomic profiles in 200 clinically annotated ACC tumors with long term follow-up and assess the value of
DNA methylation in refining transcriptomic based ACC subtyping. In Aim 2 we will profile the
methylation/transcriptome of paired primary and metastatic tumors to identify metastatic specific changes and
develop a metastatic propensity score to predict metastatic site. In Aim 3 we will profile DNA methylation in
circulating free DNA from matched tumor and blood samples, collected as part of a prospective study already
initiated, and develop a blood-based methylation score for ACC subtyping. Additionally, we will validate the
significance of our blood-based methylation score in detecting ACC subtype evolution and to predict treatment
response using blood samples collected as part of our clinical trials. Our research will be the first to investigate
ACC DNA methylation markers to identify aggressive ACC at initial diagnosis and throughout tumor progression.
Accurate diagnosis through a simple blood test will allow clinicians to detect the evolution of the disease in real-
time and guide treatment selection."

Systemic racism, lack of access to healthcare, implicit bias in care provided, and other injustices have contributed
to reprehensible healthcare disparities in minoritized communities, resulting in preventable morbidity and
mortality in older minoritized adults. Addressing disparities in health and healthcare for minoritized older adults
requires innovation in aging research at the nexus of geriatric medicine, gerontology, and palliative care
research. Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an important and promising strategy to meet this
challenge because it has been shown to reduce health disparities, reduce distrust, and result in positive health
outcomes.
 The goal of this K07 Academic Career Leadership Award is to leverage the applicant’s national leadership
in health equity and CBPR to create a sustainable training, mentoring, an incubator program in CBPR that will
result in a path towards health equity. The overarching objective is to build a cadre of geriatrics, gerontology
and palliative care researchers, clinicians, and administrators across the US with the necessary skills to harness
the power and promise of CBPR in fostering impactful and sustained conduct healthcare system change for
minoritized older adults. To accomplish this, the applicant proposes the following Specific Aims: (1) Build a
national CBPR training program focusing on health equity in older populations; (2) Measure program outcomes,
and (3) Develop a program sustainability plan.
 The applicant is a senior investigator, program innovator, and leading national expert in designing and
executing rigorous, federally-funded, CBPR research to improve care for older, minoritized, adults with serious
illness and (b) Training and mentoring healthcare professionals in aging and palliative care research that is
visioned, designed, executed, and disseminated in equal, bidirectional partnership with local communities. Her
long-term career goal is to make a broad-reaching and sustainable impact on the approach to addressing
health equity in aging and end-of-life research for minoritized older adults by establishing a nationally-available
CBPR training center for aging research. To achieve these goals, she has designed a training and skills
development program that includes a focus on 5 key areas: (1) Curriculum development for adult learners;
(2) Institutional Change leadership skills; (3) Mentorship of under-represented persons in healthcare; (4)
Implementation science, and (5) Further expertise in aging focused research.
 The creation of an impactful and sustainable CBPR training program for aging research and clinical
professionals promises to change the state of research and implementable solutions to address health disparities
across the US. This equitable academic-community partnership approach promises to overcome barriers of trust,
catalyze development of local culturally appropriate interventions, and ultimately change approaches to
disparities in aging care for varied populations of older, minoritized adults across the US."

Sodium plays a vital role in essential physiological processes, including growth, development, and regulation of
extracellular fluid volume, making it critical for survival. However, excess sodium intake is associated with an
increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders and, despite efforts by the World Health
Organization, average daily salt intake worldwide is approximately twice the recommended level. Due to
sodium’s ability to regulate the extracellular fluid volume, and thus impact cardiovascular function, its excretion
and intake are tightly regulated with the steroid hormone aldosterone (ALDO) playing a major role. In the adult
mouse brain, a single population of neurons located in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) are capable of sensing
ALDO due to their co-expression of MR and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2), the latter
prevents glucocorticoid stimulation of MR. These “NTSHSD2 neurons” have been shown to drive sodium appetite
when activated by chemo- or optogenetic tools. Furthermore, chronic treatment with ALDO increases the intrinsic
firing rate of NTSHSD2 neurons, though the molecular mechanism is unknown. The objective of this proposal is to
investigate the basis for ALDO-induced NTSHSD2 neuron activity and sodium appetite. We hypothesize that ALDO
signaling coordinates a transcriptional program that promotes NTSHSD2 neurons activity, ultimately driving sodium
appetite. To test this, Aim 1 will determine the importance of ALDO/MR signaling in NTSHSD2 neurons for sodium
appetite and investigate the effects of ALDO on NTSHSD2 neurons in vivo. Aim 2 will employ transcriptomics and
epigenomics to identify candidate ALDO/MR regulated genes in NTSHSD2 neurons during ALDO treatment that
could mediate increased spontaneous activity. Aim 3 will test the role of genes found to be regulated by sodium
deficiency or ALDO/MR signaling for their impact on NTSHSD2 neuron activity and sodium appetite. Understanding
the regulatory mechanisms of NTSHSD2 neuron activation is crucial to our understanding of sodium appetite and
data from this proposal will identify potential therapeutic targets for reducing excess sodium intake."
10903235,"The tailbud is the posterior growth zone of the post-gastrulation vertebrate embryo containing the neural and
mesodermal progenitors of the spinal column. The posterior neural tube undergoes convergence along the
medial-lateral axis while extending posteriorly, and failure of neural tube convergence leads to birth defects such
as spina bifida. The left and right paraxial mesoderm are assembled from motile mesodermal progenitors and
subsequently segmented into somites. Failure to segment the paraxial mesoderm or maintain bilateral symmetry
leads to birth defects such as congenital scoliosis. This project uses zebrafish as a model to study the molecular
biophysics and systems morphogenesis in early spinal column development. The lab recently found that inter-
tissue adhesion mediated by the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Fibronectin mechanically couples the neural
tube and paraxial mesoderm. This inter-tissue adhesion resists convergence of the neural tube which
predisposes the embryo to spina bifida. However, inter-tissue adhesion ensures bilaterally symmetric
morphogenesis of the paraxial mesoderm and thus prevents scoliosis. The interfaces between the neural tube
and the left and right paraxial mesoderm resemble adhesive lap joints which are used in engineering to efficiently
bond two objects. This project uses transgenic zebrafish to examine how the medial-lateral lap joint mechanics
are maintained (Fibronectin acts as a glue) while the neural tube simultaneously slides posteriorly relative to the
mesoderm (Fibronectin acts as a grease). Integrin heterodimers are the primary cell surface receptors for the
ECM and are central to cell and tissue mechanics because they link the ECM to the actomyosin cytoskeleton.
The lab has studied integrin activity in early spinal column development using proteomics, an in vivo FRET-FLIM
assay for Integrin conformational changes, and FCS/FCCS to measure integrin intra-heterodimer affinities in
vivo. The lab found that Integrin 51 and V1 are the two main Fibronectin receptors at this stage of zebrafish
development and that intra-heterodimer affinity sets the threshold for integrin activation. Here, the project will
quantify the molecular dynamics of single heterodimers in the neural tube and paraxial mesoderm using a new
single molecule spectroscopy and machine learning protocol that we have developed. For the first time, we can
measure the movement and conformational dynamics of a single protein in a living embryo."
10942497,"The ability to selectively modulate the expression of one or more neuronal genes is critical for defining pathways
that govern normal brain physiology and diverse disease phenotypes. Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are
attractive agents for manipulating neuronal gene expression, especially given their clear advantages relative to
gene therapy, including that ASO therapy is reversible, nonimmunogenic, and independent of gene size.
However, progress has been limited by the need for invasive routes of administration [e.g.,
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection], limited cellular uptake, and lack of cell-type specificity. A technology
capable of delivering ASOs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specifically into neurons following
intravenous (IV) administration – resulting in modulation of neuronal gene expression – would be incredibly
useful. Therefore, we have developed a bispecific antibody (bAb) shuttle that targets CD98hc, the heavy chain
of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1), and mediates delivery of IgGs across the BBB. We observe
superior brain retention of IgGs shuttled via CD98hc, as compared to shuttling via transferrin receptor (TfR-1).
Moreover, we do not observe cellular uptake of CD98hc bAbs in the brain parenchyma unless targeted to specific
cell types, which is unique relative to TfR-1 bAbs. We have also developed a first-generation CD98hc bAb that
targets glycoprotein M6A, which is selectively internalized into neurons in the mouse brain. Finally, we have
optimized the conjugation of azide-functionalized ASOs to our bAbs. Therefore, the first objective is to test the
efficacy of our first-generation, neuron-specific bAb – when conjugated to a Scn1a ASO that increases the
expression of NaV1.1 – for increasing the threshold of temperature-sensitive seizures and restoring intrinsic
excitability of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/-). The
second objective is a method development study aimed at developing second-generation bAbs that target
different cell-surface proteins enriched on neurons and evaluating their specificity for reducing Malat1 gene
expression as bAb-ASOs using single-cell RNA-seq and single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization.
Therefore, in Aim 1, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of first-generation bAb-ASOs for increasing neuronal
expression of NaV1.1 and improving associated phenotypes in Scn1a+/- mice. We will generate M6A/CD98hc
bAbs conjugated to our validated NaV1.1 ASO and evaluate their impact on temperature-sensitive seizures and
intrinsic excitability of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in Scn1a+/- mice. Next, in independent Aim 2,
we will evaluate gene silencing of second-generation bAb-ASOs that target different cell-surface proteins
enriched on neurons (e.g., synaptophysin, GRIA1, CHRM3). We propose to use a validated ASO against a non-
coding gene (Malat1) given that this gene is expressed in all brain cell types and its knockout does not produce
a phenotype. A key expected outcome is the characterization of bAb-ASOs that selectively modulate gene
expression in neuronal cells after IV administration, which has a staggering number of potential applications."
10943268,"This project describes a class of recently discovered human genes: internal open reading frames (iORFs) that
overlap annotated protein coding sequences in alternative reading frames. Because iORFs are translated in a
different reading frame, their amino acid sequences are different from the annotated protein that they overlap,
meaning that overlapping genes encode two entirely different protein products. Overlapping genes are well-
characterized in viral genomes, but were thought to be essentially absent from the human genome. While
evidence is growing that the microproteins encoded in iORFs can play important roles in human cells, it is
currently unclear how many functional human iORFs exist and how they are expressed. We provide
preliminary data demonstrating that, in potentially hundreds of cases, alternative transcript variants can recode
a human gene from expressing the annotated, canonical protein to the iORF-encoded microprotein. In Aim 1,
we will apply long-read sequencing technologies to identify and validate the existence of iORF-encoding
alternative transcripts in high throughput, thus establishing how broadly iORF recoding occurs in human cells.
In Aim 2, we will provide molecular and cellular evidence that iORFs are functional, and determine whether
their cellular roles are related to those of the canonical proteins that they overlap despite their differing amino
acid sequences. In Aim 3, we will characterize the molecular mechanism and regulation of an anti-apoptotic
iORF that overlaps a pro-apoptotic death effector domain-containing protein. Taken together, the successful
completion of these aims will demonstrate that overlapping human genes are plentiful and functional, and
provide mechanistic insight into a specific overlapping gene as a paradigmatic example of the molecular
rationale for overlapping gene organization in human. More broadly, our study will provide an entirely new
understanding of the roles of alternative transcript variants generated via alternative pre-mRNA splicing and
use of alternative transcriptional start site: instead of simply generated isoforms of known proteins, these
processes can generate novel transcripts that, in losing the ability to encode the annotated protein coding
sequence, can be reprogrammed to express frameshifted iORFs encoding currently unannotated microproteins
with distinct sequences and functions. We thus expect to reveal new levels of complexity in the human
transcriptome and proteome."
10943091,"Project Summary
Social behavior is a fundamental component of complex behaviors for animals to sustain healthy living patterns.
Consequently, deficits or dysfunctional social behaviors are found in multiple psychiatric and neurological
disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recently, a growing body of research demonstrates a
significant adaptation of astrocytes, non-neuronal glial cells in the brain, in the etiology of ASD. However, the
detailed mechanisms underlying how astrocyte dysfunction represents social behavioral deficiency remain
poorly understood. Particularly, the challenge is exaggerated by the lack of knowledge about whether and how
the local astrocytes affect the ASD-phenotype brain in cell-type, circuit, and network levels.
 Abnormal glutamatergic transmission contributes to aberrant hyperexcitability in brain regions critical for
controlling social behaviors by shifting the excitation-to-inhibition ratio. Excess glutamate is typically cleared from
the synaptic cleft into astrocytes via glutamate transporters. Our recent studies revealed that astrocyte activation
in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a hub of communications in thalamo-cortical circuits where
processes the sensitivity to external social environmental stimuli, impairs social novelty recognition while
parallelly downregulating functional astrocyte dominant glutamate transporter type 1 (GLT1; EAAT2 in humans).
Interestingly, astrocyte-specific conditional knock-out of GLT1 in the PVT mimics the impairment of social novelty
recognition, reinforcing the importance of the glutamatergic system in astrocyte-based social behavioral
modulation. Thus, based on our findings, we hypothesize that astrocytic modulation of glutamatergic signaling
has an important role in the regulation of social novelty recognition. Chemogenetic activation of astrocytes,
mimicking reactive calcium-increased astrocytes and sequentially reducing GLT1 function, impairs the normal
response of astrocytes in the PVT to neuronal activity and this, in turn, contributes to abnormal social recognition.
In contrast, GLT1 overexpression facilitates the maintenance of normal social recognition behaviors. To
investigate this hypothesis, first we will investigate the spatiotemporal glutamate and calcium signals
synchronized to social behaviors in the astrocytes and neurons and their adaptation by GLT1 modulation.
Second, we will examine the contribution of PVT GLT1 null and overexpression in synaptic events and
metabolism in the PVT circuits, and consequent social novelty recognition behaviors. Finally, we will determine
whether astrocytic glutamate modulation via GLT1 affects the brain-wide spatiotemporal signature, and the brain
network coherence provides any distinguishable profiles that represent social behavioral outcomes.
 Our study will elucidate the detailed mechanisms of astrocyte-neuron interaction via the glutamate
system encoding social novelty recognition. We will provide a rational path for the development of new
therapeutic methods for the treatment of social behavioral deficits."

Polyelectrolyte complex micelles (PCMs) are a unique class of self-assembled nanoparticles that
form with a core of associated polycations and polyanions surrounded by a neutral corona. The
hydrated nature and structural and chemical versatility make PCMs an attractive system for
delivering hydrophilic payloads while controlling carrier size and stability. While recent studies
have shown PCMs are effective at delivering nucleic acids, the design process has largely been
trial-and-error to this point with few systematic studies focused on defining and predicting PCM
properties and behavior in physiological conditions. By leveraging polymer design, controlled self-
assembly, and materials characterization techniques, the goal of this proposal, and of our
research group, is to develop design rules quantifying the relationships between polymer
and nucleic acid structure and PCM assembly, physical properties, delivery, and dynamic
behavior. We will use small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and fluorescence
imaging to accomplish three broad goals: 1) develop structure-property relationships based on
polymer and nucleic acid structure, chemistry, size, and charge density, 2) quantify the effect of
PCM component structure on cellular uptake and cargo release, and 3) uncover the mechanism,
kinetics, and factors that control nucleic acid exchange between PCMs. As each area progresses
we will use computational methods to analyze our vast PCM characterization database and
establish the scaling laws and relationships driving PCM assembly and function. The proposed
work will build the foundation for a new class of PCMs with predictive properties tailored to each
treatment, aligning our lab goals with the overarching mission of NIGMS."

It is known for more than 30 years that supporting cells in the normally quiescent avian hearing organ, the
basilar papilla, can respond to sensory hair cell death with S-phase entry, mitotic division, and generation of
replacement hair cells. The work proposed here utilizes several methodological advances for an unbiased,
comprehensive, and systematic inventorying of changes in gene expression during aminoglycoside-induced
hair cell death and in responding supporting cells. Pilot data obtained at multiple time points from single cells
isolated from the chicken basilar papilla sensory epithelium revealed that activation of a novel pathway linked
to protease-activated receptor-2, PAR2, is essential for S-phase entry of supporting cells and hair cell
regeneration. The project puts forward a speci?c hypothesis for the activation pathway, which will be explicitly
and thoroughly evaluated. Moreover, the identi?ed e?ector genes for the novel regeneration pathway will be
assessed in a new adult mouse model for long-term hair cell loss. Here, the focus is on S-phase entry of
mouse utricle and organ of Corti supporting cells four weeks after aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss.
Finally, the project will focus on the characterization of newly regenerated hair cells by reconstructing the
temporal transcriptomic changes that happen when the new hair cells mature. In parallel, it is proposed to
align transcriptomic data with in situ observations such as hair bundle formation, changes in planar cell
polarity, reestablishment of synaptic connections, and electrophysiological features such as
mechanoelectrical transduction and electrical tuning."

HPV16 remains the most prevalent oncogenic genotype, responsible for over half of all cervical cancer cases
worldwide, and HPV18 contributes another 20%. The licensed preventive HPV vaccines are not effective to
treat HPV16/18 infection or disease identified in population-based cervical screening. Nearly half of all
persistent HPV16 infections and a quarter of HPV18 progress to high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN2/3), the precursor of cervical cancer, and the risk of HPV persistence increases with age. Currently, there
are no treatment options available for persistent HPV16/18 infections that have not yet progressed to high
grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (<CIN2), other than continued screening until progression, with
subsequent surgery for CIN2/3. Patients with persistent cervical HPV16/18 infections have significant potential
for transmission and/or the development of disease at other sites, and suffer considerable psychosocial stress
associated with having a sexually-transmitted infection that can cause cancer. Therefore, there is a clear
unmet medical need for a therapeutic medical intervention to safely eliminate persistent HPV16/18 infections
before oncogenic progression. Patients with a persistent HPV16/18 infection are likely to be highly motivated to
receive such a therapy and avoid progression requiring an excisional procedure that is associated with
significant rates of recurrence and side effects including infection, cervical incompetence and premature birth.
The goal of this proposal is to develop a treatment regimen that safely and effectively elicits immune clearance
of persistent cervical HPV16/18 infections, thereby intercepting progression to cervical cancer precursor
lesions and cervical cancer. We developed a DNA vaccine, pBI-11, encoding HPV16/18 E6 and E7 proteins
that are linked to the danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) because it
dramatically enhances HPV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity and antitumor potency in mice. However,
DNA vaccines alone have shown limited potency in patients because of inefficient delivery. Needle-free
delivery of a naked DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D) with a jet device was shown to be safe and effective for prevention
of SARS-CoV2 and received licensure in India, demonstrating the utility of these devices in patients for potent
delivery of a DNA vaccine. The Specific Aims of our randomized, double-blind phase II study are: (1) To
assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of repeat intradermal or intramuscular vaccination with
pBI-11 DNA via a needle-free jet device in women with HPV16 and/or HPV18+ <CIN2 cervical disease;
(2) To determine the immunogenicity of intradermal or intramuscular jet administration of pBI-11 DNA
to women with HPV16/18+ <CIN2 cervical disease; (3) To examine virologic, cytologic, and pathologic
changes at the cervix upon repeat intradermal or intramuscular needle-free jet administration of pBI-11
DNA in women with HPV16 and/or HPV18+ <CIN2 cervical disease. This novel intervention may also
prevent other HPV-associated anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in addition to cervical cancer."

hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or cellular immunotherapy (IMTX) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Center (FHCC), University of Washington (UW) or Seattle Children’s Hospital (SCH) under protocols developed
at the FHCC. The services of this core unit address several closely related areas: identification and management
of late complications, data and research sample collection, database assembly and evaluation of the efficiency,
accuracy, quality and utility of the data collection and the system in which the data are stored. We have
developed several mechanisms to support this overall goal.
 1. We will collect long-term data focused on survival, therapy-related complications, and health relevant to
 the clinical research studies supported by this grant. This includes the prospective cohort of patients to
 be studied in Projects 2 and 3 of this grant application who require follow-up for at least 15 years after
 treatment. For this purpose, a system has been established to track and maintain contact with patients
 and referring physicians so that data can be collected at specified time points after treatment.
 2. We will assist investigators in obtaining information and research biospecimens that are not routinely
 collected but are needed for individual research projects.
 3. We will continue to identify barriers that interfere with long-term follow-up of geographically dispersed
 patients and develop methods to overcome these barriers.
 4. We will continue to evaluate the research methods employed in data collection and database
 management, including the efficiency, reliability, validity and utility of the instruments used for data
collection.
The data generated from this core unit will assist project leaders in understanding the long-term efficacy of
experimental treatments and identifying late complications and mechanisms of relapse after cellular therapy with
HCT or targeted T cell therapies. Close coordination with the clinical Long-Term Follow-Up Program (LTFU) that
provides telemedicine services ensures prompt notification of clinical events such as relapse. Integrating long-
term data collection efforts across the Projects through Core D provides efficient services to support this

10935610,"Project Summary (Overall)
 The goal of this P30 application is to support the community of scientists who use outbred
heterogeneous stock (HS) rats to understand the genetic basis of individual differences in vulnerability to
substance use disorders (SUDs). Although this is a new grant, one of its main goals is to provide core services
that have been offered for the past 10 years by our NIDA P50 grant. When that grant was originally funded,
mice were the mainstay of mammalian quantitative genetics. A major study using HS rats had recently been
completed in Europe, and Dr. Leah Solberg Woods (PI of Core B) was maintaining the only US-based colony
of HS rats, which was supported by an R01 from NIDDK. A central theme of our initial P50 was that
establishing the HS rat as a platform for quantitative genetic studies would allow us to examine complex
behavioral traits that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. Ten years later, we have established a vibrant
community of investigators who use HS rats not only for genome wide association studies (GWAS) but also to
study the genetic basis of individual differences in vulnerability to SUD-like behaviors. We have also
accumulated a database of more than 15,000 deeply phenotyped and genotyped rats. This community
depends on several critical core services that will be provided by this P30. First, and foremost, Core B, the
Breeding Core, will maintain two HS rat breeding colonies, located at Wake Forest University and the
University of California San Diego. An innovative new component of Core B is our introduction of RATTACA,
which uses data collected over the last decade to predict phenotypes of newborn HS rats based on their
genotype. As we describe, RATTACA allows us to provide groups of rats with high and low phenotypes,
allowing non-geneticists to study individual differences using statistically valid methodology. Core C, the
Genotyping, Analysis and eQTL Core, provides services including genotyping of HS rats, GWAS, mapping
of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS). In addition,
the Administrative Core (Core A), will maintain and distribute data from more than 15,000 HS rats that have
been accumulated over the last decade, as well as newly collected data, following FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) practices as described in our Data Management and Sharing Plan. The
Administrative Core will also provide oversight, coordination, education for high school and undergraduate
students and will implement several aspects of our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP).
Finally, Core D, the Pilot Project Core, will provide grants and free services from Cores A, B and C in an
effort to support early-stage investigators, broaden the impact of our center, and execute our PEDP. These
cores will provide both stability and innovation that will promote the use of HS rats to study the genetic basis of
individual differences."
10933339,"Despite advancements in cyber security, ransomware attacks have occurred in health care with devastating
effects. In the last 5 years, an estimated 60,000 radiotherapy treatments have been impacted by ransomware
attacks affecting Radiation Oncology departments. Our project starts from the assumption that ransomware
attacks will occur, and asks the question: what can be done to resume radiation treatments as rapidly and safely
as possible during and after an attack? We refer to this concept as ransomware attack resiliency. Radiation
oncology is particularly susceptible to ransomware attacks because it is the most technology reliant medical
discipline as the ability to safely deliver radiation therapy is heavily reliant on multiple complicated software
systems. If a ransomware attack does occur, Radiation Oncology patients are critically impacted as inevitable
delays in treatment result in worse clinical outcomes, complicated workarounds result in unsafe treatment
conditions, and the attacks stressed aspects of clinical care (transportation and communication) that
disproportionately impacted patients with adverse social determinants of health. Research into ransomware
attack response in Radiation Oncology has been primitive. Our project will form a multi-disciplinary team and
patient advisory board to develop innovative Radiation Oncology specific ransomware resiliency methods and
tools. Aim 1 will develop design goals through structured interview of frontline staff, meetings with a patient
advisory board, and by performing ransomware attack resiliency exercises by disabling software components
needed to treat a patient (thereby mimicking a ransomware attack) and asking the team to treat simulated
patients. The structured interviews will be evaluated using rigorous qualitative data from cognitive interviews and
the resiliency exercises will be evaluated using quantitative metrics. Aim 2 will develop novel software
functionality for ransomware resiliency including: 1) a robust Relational Backup System that innovatively
generates a backup of essential relationships between data elements on multiple systems, 2) Record and Verify
and treatment planning system minimum functionality algorithms, and 3) imaging checks based on artificial
intelligence methods. A comprehensive ransomware management document will be developed with strategies
for mitigating the impact of ransomware attacks on patients with adverse social determinants of health. Aim 3
will longitudinally implement the proposed innovations in diverse circumstances and iterate the
development/evaluation cycle 4 times. We will implement the developed innovations from Aim 2 and repeat the
structured interviews, meetings with the patient advisory board, and resiliency exercises. Our project can
significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy at institutions impacted by ransomware
attacks. The innovations and methods from our work can reduce the time needed to return to safely treating
patients thereby improved chances for cancer cure, reduce the potential for medical errors, and mitigate
treatment barriers for patients with adverse determinants of health."
10934709,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
The Administrative Core will administer and lead the P01, including the other four Cores and the four Projects.
The Administrative Core is led by TIME-AD MPIs, with additional support from an Executive Committee
comprised of co-Investigators from across TIME-AD institutions. The Core will coordinate the complex project
to optimize use of common resources and results; ensure good communication; promote the scientific priorities
of rigorous prevention research, reproducible methodology, and health equity; and disseminate results to
relevant stakeholders. The Administrative Core will engage in the proactive monitoring of projects via a project
dashboard, annual planning meetings, monthly Executive Committee meetings, biweekly Administrative Core
leadership meetings, and other regular meetings within and across Projects. These activities will ensure
progress on the aims of the P01, including the development of the scientific teams, the implementation of
rigorous analyses, and translation from data to evidence via dissemination. As part of these responsibilities,
the Administrative Core will communicate with the NIA, including providing progress reports and less formal
updates on our accomplishments or any challenges that arise. The Core will set standards for authorship,
collaboration, decision-making, and resource sharing. Finally, the Administrative Core will be charged with
recruiting and supporting early career scholars who are currently affiliated with TIME-AD (e.g. the 11 co-
Investigators who are Early Career Investigators) or who will become affiliated over the study period. These
mentoring activities will be supported by a dedicated Project Manager as well as the many initiatives that
TIME-AD MPIs and co-Investigators are already involved with, including T32s, training-focused R13s and
R25s, and PhD programs. The Administrative Core Aims are to: 1) provide leadership for the P01 and direction
for its activities; 2) monitor timely progress, fidelity, quality, and effectiveness of operations of all Projects and
Cores and conduct all reporting activities; 3) maintain strong relationships through regular communication with
everyone involved in the project; 4) convene the External Advisory Board meetings; and 5) foster connections
with related Projects, including training and research initiatives, and chart the future projects and priorities for
the TIME-AD investigator community. Although the Equity and Dissemination Core will ensure this is infused
throughout the P01, the Administrative Core will also play a key role in overseeing equity emphases throughout
the Projects and Cores. In collaboration with Projects and Cores, we will have progress benchmarks, including
development of data sets, development of analytic code, preparation of publications, and dissemination of
results via peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences, code-sharing platforms, and beyond, including
professional organizations, popular media, and other mechanisms to reach non-scientists."
10751045,"ABSTRACT
Uncontrolled inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD which can develop following
chronic exposure to ozone. Evidence suggests that these pathologies are due to an inability to adequately
resolve the acute inflammatory response to lung injury. This suggests that promoting the resolution of
inflammation will be more beneficial than suppressing persistent unrestrained inflammation. Our studies are
focused on macrophages which play a key role in both initiating and resolving inflammatory responses to
tissue injury. This activity is mediated by distinct subsets broadly classified as proinflammatory M1 and
proresolution M2 macrophages. Effective resolution of inflammation depends on metabolic reprogramming of
macrophages from an M1 phenotype to an M2 phenotype, which involves a switch from glycolysis to oxidative
phosphorylation as a source of energy. We discovered that this reprogramming is suppressed following chronic
ozone exposure. The goal of our studies is to analyze mechanisms underlying suppression of macrophage
reprogramming. In recent studies we identified farnesoid-X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor important in bile
acid metabolism, with anti-inflammatory activity, as important in promoting M1 to M2 macrophage
reprogramming in the lung. Following ozone exposure, macrophage FXR activity is downregulated. This is
associated with increased activity of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and reduced activity of proresolving M2
macrophages. We also found that microRNAs that regulate the proinflammatory transcription factor NFκB are
dysregulated in macrophages after ozone exposure. As a consequence, there is protracted activation of NFκB
signaling resulting in increased production of TNFα, IL-1β, and cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species. We
hypothesize that these mediators suppress FXR activity which prevents activation of the nuclear receptor
NR4A1, a key inducer of macrophage M1 to M2 metabolic reprogramming. To test this hypothesis, we will (1)
Determine if persistent inflammation following chronic ozone exposure and the development of lung disease is
due to defective development of proresolution M2 macrophages, and assess whether this is caused by
protracted activation of NFκB in M1 macrophages; (2) Analyze the role of FXR and its target NR4A1, in the
development of proresolution M2 macrophages in the lung following chronic ozone exposure; and (3)
Determine if protracted activation of NFκB is due to ozone-induced alterations in microRNAs regulating NFκB.
Results of these studies will provide new mechanistic insights into chronic ozone toxicity and may lead to the
development of new approaches for thwarting the development of chronic lung disease."

Integral membrane proteins reside in the biological membrane where they function and intimately interact with
lipid molecules. The membrane environment is dynamic and composed of a rich chemical diversity of lipids.
Alongside the complexity of the biological membrane is the growing realization of the important roles of lipid
molecules in modulating the structure and function of membrane proteins. Although a small subset of examples
exist that provide insight into membrane protein-lipid interactions, how individual lipid molecules influence the
structure and function of membrane proteins on the molecular level remains poorly understood. What determines
the selectivity of membrane proteins towards lipids? How important is the lipid chemistry such as lipid tail length,
stereochemistry, and position of unsaturated double bonds in protein-lipid interactions? Addressing these
fundamental questions is hindered not only by identifying the lipids that bind avidly to membrane proteins but
also the biophysical characterization of protein-lipid interactions. Herein, this proposal seeks to develop and
apply a highly innovative and integrative approaches to better understand how lipids impact the structure and
function of membrane proteins. Our first objective is the development of integrative methods, combining
lipidomics with native mass spectrometry (MS), to identify specific protein-lipid interactions from natural extracts
by using (i) progressive washes of the immobilized membrane proteins and (ii) lipid exchange within empty and
membrane protein loaded nanodiscs. In our second objective, native MS technology will be used to biophysically
characterize individual lipid binding events to membrane proteins, providing insight into affinity and selectivity.
Moreover, MS approaches of membrane proteins in nanodiscs will be employed to glean insight into lipids
enriched around membrane proteins. These new methods will identify lipids that avidly associate with the target
membrane protein, providing a roadmap for our third objective focused on understanding how tightly bound lipids
affect function and structure of membrane proteins. Membrane proteins devoid of any contaminating lipids will
be reconstituted into liposomes and nanodiscs in the presence and absence of a tightly bound lipid. Structural
and functional studies will lead to visualization of lipid binding sites and structural and functional changes induced
by the bound lipids. Observations from structural and functional studies will then be rigorously examined with
mutational studies. Taken together, the results and outcomes from our proposed studies are anticipated to have
a significant impact in our understanding of membrane protein-lipid interactions and, more generally, how
changes in the biological membrane may regulate membrane protein physiological function."

 Macrophages are important contributors to the biology of the tumor microenvironment. As tumors penetrate
the prostatic capsule they invade a lipid-rich depot known as the peri-prostatic fat (PPF). An ability to utilize this
energy source is important for tumor progression. PPF is a white adipose tissue (WAT) that encases the prostate
and is a depot of adipocytes and resident macrophages termed adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). PPF and
activated ATMs are relatively understudied components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Adipose tissues
represent a nutrient reservoir from which tumor cells can gain access to adipokines. “Browning” of WAT results
in a more vascular and multilocular fat phenotype and it is not clear whether this represents an adaptive metabolic
response in PPF to suppress or accelerate tumor growth. There is heterogeneity in lipid availability in the prostate
TME: ATMs reside in a lipid-rich storage environment composed primarily of adipocytes whereas tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) inhabit stroma where there is a paucity of adipocytes. Metabolic
reprogramming in tumor cells is well documented; however, limited recent studies have reported that ATMs in
visceral fat or breast TME can acquire a metabolically activated phenotype (MMe) distinct from the M1/M2
phenotypes. Our preliminary studies identified a potentially critical immuno-metabolic signaling axis in
macrophages involving pro-inflammatory receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140), lipid-regulating fatty acid
binding proteins 4/5 (FABP4/5) and Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) that synthesizes neutral lipids
and is required for fat absorption and storage. RIP140, a co-activator of NF-kB, is important for promoting pro-
inflammatory cytokines characteristic of M1 activation, in macrophage M1/M2 polarization, and in browning of
WAT. Both FABPs and DGAT1 can be regulated in vivo and in vitro using small molecule inhibitors some of
which are in development and being tested as potential therapies. The proposed study will investigate a central
hypothesis: PPF is a highly dynamic depot, and increased lipid stores in the TME can promote tumor progression
by triggering lipid-rich ATMs to secrete pro-tumorigenic cytokines/chemokines and lipid mediators, thus,
switching ATMs to a harmful pro-inflammatory MMe phenotype. We will use in vivo and in vitro models to test
whether altering DGAT1 or FABP4/5 activity is tumor suppressive. Our aims will define mechanisms regulating
the immuno-metabolic axis in ATMs and TAMs in prostate cancer (PCa), and determine whether the MMe
phenotype subpopulation is increased in locally invasive PCa. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the role and functional significance of an understudied phenotype, MMe, that merges both
inflammatory and lipid signaling pathways in the prostate TME. Targeted therapies will be tested in multicellular
organoid cultures and relevant murine xenograft models. Successful completion of these studies will set the
stage for more comprehensive pre-clinical investigations and potential translation to the clinic in the medium
term."

The Microscopy and Tissue Processing Core provides the equipment, expertise, supplies and technical service
to meet both the routine and advanced microscopy needs of NEI-funded investigators at UC Davis who
emphasize cell biological approaches. Expensive devices such as cryostats, ultramicrotomes, ventilated
embedding ovens, refrigerated UV polymerization units for catalyzing the polymerization of resins such as LR
White, and freeze substitution systems, and hazardous reagents such as the heavy metal salts for electron
microscopy and solvents and stains for light microscopy, are all provided in a more cost-effective manner with a
Core service. As many of these reagents and processes involve hazardous compounds, it is similarly more cost
effective to have hazardous waste processing confined to a single unit. While most investigators are expert in
the most sophisticated types of light microscopy, very few have the knowledge to conduct light and electron
microscopy of embedded specimens. Having a dedicated, well-trained staff in a service core produces high
quality results in a more efficient manner."

In both the United States and globally, we are witnessing an unprecedented increase in the elderly
population (> 65 years) and the very elderly population (> 85 years). This demographic shift has led to a
significant rise in the number of individuals affected by age-related diseases and conditions, with a
particularly profound impact on cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and related dementias (ADRD).
There is an urgent imperative to create more accurate and practical predictive models for these
conditions, usable across a wide range of clinical settings in the United States. Much of ADRD related
advances (e.g., risk factors such as lifestyles, cognitive signs and symptoms, latest treatments) is often
embedded in Pubmed literatures, which are not directly available for computational analysis and manual
extraction is very time consuming and costly. To the best of our knowledge, there are no investigations on
predictive models for dynamic ADRD risk assessment leveraging knowledge from literatures. Our current
parent grant is focusing on the development of a computable rare disease knowledge hub to accelerate
rare disease knowledge discovery. To respond to NOSI-AG-23-032,
this
administrative supplement
application will utilize the increasing availability of EHR and the graph embedding methodology created in
the parent proposal, alongside our proficiency in real-time and real-world risk modeling, to evaluate the
effectiveness, implementability, and clinical utility of dynamic ADRD risk modeling in elderly population. In
our preliminary work, we have investigated methods to extract entities and relationships from unstructured
text data and showcased GRU-D based architectures in real-time risk assessment of post surgical
complications (PSC) 1,2 and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3,4 with a reasonable model explainability at
population level. We will further construct an ADRD knowledge hub (ADKH), and integrate the ADKH
with GRU-D based dynamic ADRD risk assessment to overcome both data quality issues and difficulties
in feature selection and representation of EHR data. Our specific aims include (1) construction of a
computable ADKH to accelerate ADRD knowledge discovery, and (2) performance evaluation, feasibility,
and model explainability research of gated GRU-D based models for ADRD risk assessment in the elderly
population, leveraging ADKH and EHR."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated hundreds of thousands of genetic variants with
human disease and complex traits. 90% of associated variants reside in noncoding sequences that can
enhance or suppress gene expression levels. While GWAS does not reveal the target genes of associated
variants, extraordinary effort has been dedicated to mapping target genes that carry out the functional effects
of noncoding genetic variation. While knowing which genetic variants cause disease is not often sufficient for
clinical intervention, identifying disease genes can efficiently accelerate the development of therapeutics.
Correlations between genotype and gene expression, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
studies, can provide valuable insight into the mechanism of disease-associated variants. For example, a
previous study found MAPK3 to be associated with schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental phenotypes via a
key role in neuronal proliferation. Thousands of genetic associations are still uncharacterized in terms of their
target genes and cell types of action. This proposal will develop new algorithms to robustly map disease-
associated variants to disease-critical genes and infer their cell-type-specific regulatory behavior across three
aims. First, we hypothesize that new disease-critical genes will be discovered if variants are accurately
mapped to target genes in non-Europeans, where cohorts are small and variant-to-gene mapping is imprecise.
To this end, we will develop a novel gene-disease mapping technique for understudied populations. Second,
we hypothesize that linking distal regulatory variants to target genes should provide mechanistic explanations
for many uncharacterized GWAS variants. To this end, we will develop a high-dimensional feature selection
technique to detect distal effects on gene expression. Third, we hypothesize that novel variant-to-gene links
can be identified by analyzing rare cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing. To this end, we will link variants
to genes in cell-type-specific contexts using mixed models for heritability estimation. Overall, while gene
expression prediction models are a powerful tool to link genes to disease, they have been applied to only
limited study designs: single ancestry gene expression cohorts (which are not powerful in non-European
populations with limited sample sizes), predictor variants in the cis regulatory window, and bulk tissue or cell
type gene expression data. There are many open questions due to these limitations that our proposal aims to
address including the degree to which genetic variation regulates gene expression in population-specific
manners, via long-range mechanisms, in cell-type-specific or cell-state-specific manners, and in ways that are
relevant to complex traits and diseases. Our contribution is expected to be significant because still 30% of
disease-associated variants have no known target gene and because this work will diversify genetic discovery
to populations who are most at risk."

The inflammatory response is critical in tissue healing. While extensively explored at the site of injury, relatively
little is known about how injury at a remote site communicates back to the bone marrow to regulate the systemic
immune response. Previous studies have demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can directly
respond to secreted cytokines derived from the injury site. However, this model is limited by the need to reach a
critical threshold of cytokines within the blood prior to the bone marrow HSCs responding, limiting overall
responsiveness. Using our established model of polytrauma-induced heterotopic ossification (HO), we have
identified the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate as being highly and specifically enriched within the injury
site. Using single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics, combined with molecular and histological validation,
we found that itaconate is made exclusively within highly mature neutrophils. Our previous work has
demonstrated a direct role of myeloid-lineage cell-derived itaconate in mitigating HO formation. However, these
studies identified a secondary effect of itaconate as a novel modulator of hematopoiesis. Our preliminary data
show that itaconate is made exclusively in injury site neutrophils, stimulated by TLR9 activation. Itaconate
production in these mature, injury site neutrophils is facilitated through changes in neutrophil metabolism,
including shifts in glucose and glutamine usage through the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
These itaconate-laden neutrophils are able to extravasate from the injured tissue and home back to the bone
marrow. Once in the bone marrow, neutrophils are phagocytosed by macrophages, inhibiting macrophage Il1b
expression, a known regulator of HSC differentiation, in an itaconate-dependent manner. These preliminary
findings support our central hypothesis that neutrophils serve as an itaconate-dependent systemic sensor,
coupling local extremity injury to systemic inflammation by regulating BM hematopoiesis.
This conceptual model will be explored in studies divided into two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will identify the
transcriptional and metabolic regulation of neutrophils which induces expression of Acod1 and production of
itaconate specifically within the injury site. Specific Aim 2 will map the cycling of itaconate-laden neutrophils from
the injury site back to the bone marrow and determine how clearance of these neutrophils by macrophages
results in hematopoietic skewing. Our results should provide a new mechanism through which the body
coordinates activation of the local and systemic immune response following injury."

During fetal life or in adulthood, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are positioned adjacent to venous sinusoids, specialized veins that provide support for stem cell homeostasis. Previously, we found that sinusoids interact directly with HSCs in a process we termed “cuddling,” and this supports HSC division. We investigated the transcriptional program of venous sinusoids and published a method to overexpress transcription factors (TFs) to reprogram ectopic regions of the zebrafish embryo to become venous sinusoids. These new vessels support local blood stem cell self-renewal. We now plan to examine vascular reprogramming in adults to provide an alternative location for hematopoietic stem cells to form blood during stress or infiltrative disorders of the marrow. Through comparing single cell RNA-seq analyses of adult liver sinusoids and marrow sinusoids from zebrafish, mice and humans, we found five new TFs specifically expressed in the marrow sinusoids. We plan to overexpress these TFs in the hope of transforming the adult liver, which typically does not support hematopoiesis, into a hematopoietic site. Preliminary data overexpressing TFEC and MAFB using a liver-sinusoid-specific enhancer demonstrates activation of much of the marrow sinusoid fate in vivo. Overexpression of these factors in human iPSC-derived venous sinusoids leads to enhanced proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in co-culture. We plan to overexpress the human orthologs of other TFs found in zebrafish to examine the support of HSPCs in vitro. The reprogrammed venous sinusoids could be used to expand HSCs in vitro. In an effort to understand how niche endothelial cells (ECs) cuddle HSCs, we undertook a chemical genetic screen to find small molecules that regulate the process. We found that antagonists of the G-coupled receptor, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1), stimulate stem cell division specifically nearby cuddling ECs in vivo. The receptor is specifically expressed by the sinusoids in zebrafish and humans. Using lipidomics, we found that the CysLTR1 ligand, LTD4, is present in the zebrafish larval niche where HSCs divide. LTD4 suppresses the HSC division nearby cuddling ECs. Using genetics, chemical biology, and biochemistry, we plan to define the mechanism by which LTD4 regulates endothelial cells to support HSC self-renewal. Our work will provide a new understanding of the mechanism of endothelial cuddling and its role in HSC division, potentially leading to new chemical or cell therapy to induce HSC division and maintenance for the treatment of blood disorders."

This Project aims to build on the previous Phase I interactive digital media (IDM) product, Model It!. Model It was a
product that spun out of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Cell Collective product, a research-grade computational
modeling and simulation technology that is used by biomedical researchers and post-secondary educators around the
world. To make this product age-appropriate for middle-schoolers, Phase I focused on content creation and interactivity
designed for a much less technical audience.
For Phase II, the goal of ModelIt! remains focused on the design and integration of computational modeling and
simulation technology in after-school programming environments that serve students in grades 5-8. Modeling and
simulation skills can be difficult to establish in afterschool learning environments where the learning agenda caters to
ever-changing dynamics (students coming and going, shorter activity lengths, snack schedules, rotating educators, rotating
activities and perhaps locations, and thus access to resources, etc.). The integration of this technology does require
students to have access to digital devices; each of our partners has secured learning environments that will support this.
The approach for this IDM product is the development of ten fundamental skills that span model-building and
simulation-based experimentation. To establish these fundamental skills, students will engage with ModelIt!, whereby
students will use repetition to build muscle memory for each of the ten essential skills (e.g., adding a component,
removing a component, adding an arrow). For each level, students will progress through a series of challenges that
become increasingly harder; once they master the skill, the technology will automatically advance the student to the next
level (skill).
The Project Team is advised by a leading international expert in computational modeling technologies used within the
fields of biomedical research and systems biology. It is led by an educational technology design and development expert
with expertise in business development. The project will employ established experts whose specialties span instructional
design and development, educational leadership, administration, and teacher professional development, educator
recruitment and training, and the accommodation of early adopter education innovators. It will also employ a technology
development team with experience with this software. Together, this team will design, develop, field-test, and deploy the
IDM product to a diverse student population via established partnerships with large-scale after-school programs in several
states: NE STEM 4U, Kids that Code, Beyond School Bells, Strategic Air and Space Museum, Academies of Math &
Science - Peoria Academy, Riverbend Middle School, Advanced Preparatory International, Culver City Unified School
District.
The expected outcome for this project is a fully functional computational modeling application designed for 5th-8th grade
students that, through interactive web-based engagement, effectively develops foundational computational skills."

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of age-related marrow failure disorders characterized by
cytopenia and anemia. It is estimated that 10,000 new cases of MDS are diagnosed in the United States each
year. This is caused by the functional decline of hematopoietic stem cells in the marrow because of acquired
genetic mutations that corrupt their ability to make blood cells effectively. Clinical management of MDS
remains challenging with limited treatments available, and stem cell transplantation remains the only curative
therapy. However, most patients are unable to receive transplantation due to advanced age and co-
morbidities. Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand the complexity of the disease which can lead
to the development of novel therapies. Somatic mutations in splicing factor genes including SRSF2, U2AF1,
SF3B1 and ZRSR2 are found in most patients with MDS. Patients carrying splicing mutation are generally
older, have inferior prognoses, and are at a higher risk of transforming to secondary leukemia. Recent studies
found that mutations in splicing factor genes trigger an elevated level of cellular R-loops, which consists of a
RNA:DNA hybrid structure and a displaced single-stranded DNA. While R-loops are natural by-products of
active transcription, if left unresolved, they could pose as a threat to genome integrity due to their propensity
to induce double strand breaks. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that targeting R-loop-induced
genomic instability is an attractive therapeutic strategy in MDS cells that carry endogenous mutations in RNA
splicing factors. Our preliminary data suggest that cells mutated for splicing factors are exquisitely sensitive
to clinically approved PARP inhibitors, such as Olaparib, and a novel PARP1-specific inhibitor, AZD5305.
Moreover, we provide evidence that PARP can physically associate with R-loops to dampen R-loop-induced
genomic instability, and that PARP1 activity at R-loops could be used as a predictive biomarker for PARP
inhibitor response. This proposal has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to dissect the underlying molecular
mechanisms of PARP inhibitor sensitivity in the context of splicing mutant MDS, and to test the therapeutic
potential of PARP inhibitors in pre-clinical MDS models. In Aim 2, we plan to expand and identify combination
therapy strategies with PARP and PARP1-specific inhibitors. We first plan to determine whether that
combining PARP and ATR inhibitors can induce synergistic effects in MDS cells with RNA splicing mutations.
Next, we plan to identify and test novel sensitizers of PARP1-specific inhibitor to evaluate optimal combination
treatment strategy using pre-clinical models. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to the validation
of new treatment options that can hopefully improve the outcomes MDS patients."

Sepsis is a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients and involves a dysregulated host inflammatory
response to infection. Despite decades of clinical trials, no new, effective treatments have been identified, and
mortality rates remain unacceptably high. Several factors have contributed to this impasse, starting with the
complex challenge of accurately detecting the microbial pathogens precipitating sepsis. Heterogeneity across
patient populations is a second key barrier to the development of effective treatment strategies, given that sepsis
can be caused by a broad diversity of microbes, and immune responses vary widely between patients. In
addition, while disease trajectories and interventional needs differ dramatically between individuals, no
prognostic tools exist that account for both the host response and pathogen, the two primary drivers of sepsis
pathobiology. Here we seek to address key gaps in our understanding and treatment of sepsis by leveraging
blood and plasma specimens collected from 1563 patients enrolled across 60 medical centers in the CLOVERS
trial, the largest study of septic shock to date. Aim 1 seeks to identify known and novel pathogens responsible
for septic shock using metagenomic sequencing of host and microbe, a novel culture-independent method for
studying sepsis. Aim 2 will combine host gene expression and microbial metagenomic data to discover novel
sepsis subphenotypes and evaluate their associations with clinical outcomes. Aim 3 will use machine learning
to develop a multiomic classifier that predicts sepsis mortality by incorporating host transcriptomic, microbial
metagenomic, and clinical data. Together, these aims will accelerate our understanding of sepsis pathogenesis,
and could redefine our diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a syndrome characterized by exercise
intolerance due to breathlessness and fatigue, is a major public health problem rising in
prevalence. No pharmacologic strategy has been shown to improve exertional symptoms in
HFpEF patients, but exercise training is beneficial. For this reason, guidelines strongly
recommend that patients with HFpEF engage in regular exercise. Despite this recommendation,
physical activity in patients with HFpEF is dismally low, and a recent NHLBI working group
identified strategies to increase adoption and adherence to physical activity recommendations
among patients with HFpEF as a research priority.
Insights from behavioral economics have been shown to both better reflect the ‘predictable
irrationality’ of humans and to be effective in designing interventions that achieve sustained
improvements in health behavior. Our group has tested the ability of interventions guided by
behavioral economic insights using our NIH-funded Way to Health software platform, which
captures physical activity from wearable devices and automates the processing of incentives
and feedback. In randomized controlled trials enrolling obese patients and older adults with or at
risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease, we have shown that interventions using gamification
and social incentives increase physical activity during 3-month interventions, which are
sustained over 3-month follow-up. If these effects could be translated to patients with HFpEF, it
would represent a safe and readily implementable exercise strategy that could lead to sustained
improvements in quality of life and functional capacity, and heart failure hospitalizations in a
cohort of patients with few therapeutic options.
In this study, we propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial with a 6-month
intervention and then a 3-month follow-up period to address the following aims: Aim 1: To
evaluate the effectiveness of gamification plus either ‘support’ or ‘competition’ to increase
adherence to physical activity in HFpEF patients. Aim 2: To evaluate whether increased
adherence to physical activity recommendations in the intervention arms translates to improved
quality of life and functional capacity. Aim 3: To determine the association between increases in
step count and improvements in quality of life and functional capacity, establishing a minimum
clinically important difference in daily steps for patients with HFpEF. If this low-cost, highly
scalable intervention increases adherence to physical activity recommendations and improves
quality of life, it would warrant a larger trial to assess its effects on HF hospitalizations."

Since the identification of disease-causing genes, the promise of gene correction seemed out of reach for
decades. New delivery vehicles and gene-editing tools have brought the field to an inflection point in our ability
to address the molecular basis of disease. Remarkable results in spinal muscular atrophy, inherited blindness,
and hemoglobinopathies are just the beginning of a revolution in precision medicine. However, many unknowns
remain including the durability of gene replacement therapy, the adaptive immune response to gene therapies,
and unintentional genomic changes including vector integrations. In the clinic, these concerns are reminiscent
of gene therapy failures of the past, and recent clinical trial deaths in high-dose adeno-associated virus (AAV)
clinical trials illustrate the significance of improving our understanding of the host response to gene therapy. We
have previously shown that, in the absence of an immune response, CRISPR-mediated genome editing effects
are maintained for the lifetime of an animal. However, the adaptive immune response can reverse gene
correction. Additionally, we observed a high level of vector integration leading to chimeric transcripts. The
biological consequences of these genomic and transcriptomic alterations are unknown. The goal of this MIRA
research program is to develop a better understanding of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic outcomes of
gene therapy. We aim to answer long-standing questions including: (1) What are the epigenetic and
transcriptional consequences of vector integration on long-term outcomes? (2) Is there a cell, tissue, or promoter
dependency on the behavior of the vector genome? (3) Is there a differential host response to integrated vectors,
episomal vectors, or alternate delivery vehicles? To answer these questions, we will use a convergence of tools
and techniques including CRISPR-mediated targeted integration, PCR-free long-read DNA sequencing, and
spatial biology. These approaches are supported by robust preliminary data in the PI’s lab. Using nanopore long-
read sequencing, we have developed methods for characterizing full-length AAV insertions and epigenetic
alterations to AAV genomes and resulting transcriptional changes. We are adapting spatial biology techniques
to characterize host responses to divergent gene therapy vehicles in skeletal muscle, cardiac tissue, liver, and
others. Answers to these questions will enable improved design of gene therapy approaches with the aim of life-
long correction in a range of diseases."
10942408,"Oral anticancer medications (OAM) are becoming standard of care for growing numbers of patients. Multiple
myeloma (MM), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are hematologic
malignancies for which costly, long-term OAMs are a life-extending therapy. However, OAM nonadherence
(i.e., delaying, not starting, taking more/less than prescribed, or stopping use) is a critical understudied issue
that can dramatically affect cancer outcomes. The reasons for poor adherence, the characteristics of those at
risk for poor adherence, and the effects of poor adherence on health outcomes are poorly understood,
particularly in those with hematologic malignancies. Multi-level factors that affect adherence may be unique
based on adherence phase, including initiation (time from prescription to first dose taken) and persistence
(consistently taking as prescribed). Our preliminary data among patients with MM identified 3 distinct OAM
adherence trajectory groups. While almost 63% of patients maintained near-perfect adherence over 6 months,
over 27% began at 85% and dropped below 70%, and 10% had consistently very low adherence (40%). Self-
reported race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black/African American and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white)
predicted very low adherence, which was associated with reduced quality of life (QOL). System barriers (i.e.,
care delays, specialty pharmacy barriers, insurance approvals, high costs) and symptom concerns influenced
adherence and negatively affected QOL and employment decisions. Our long-term goal is to develop targeted,
culturally sensitive interventions to improve OAM adherence and health outcomes, particularly among groups
most at risk for disparate cancer outcomes. The overall objective of this theoretically guided study is to
comprehensively characterize OAM adherence initiation and persistence and identify temporal correlates with
1) multi-level factors that increase risk for poor adherence and 2) health outcomes in socioeconomically
diverse patients with MM, CML, and CLL. A prospective (pre-therapy [T0] with repeated monthly measures
[T1-T12] for one-year post-therapy initiation), mixed methods design will be used in 306 socioeconomically
diverse patients prescribed long-term OAM therapy for MM, CML, and CLL. Aim 1 is to characterize the
initiation and persistence phases of OAM adherence. Aim 2 will identify multi-level factors influencing OAM
adherence initiation and persistence. Aim 3 will explore relationships between OAM adherence initiation and
persistence and health outcomes (health care utilization, QOL, molecular response, progression-free survival,
overall survival). Aim 4 will explore factors affecting the patient experience of taking OAMs at initiation and
during persistence, based on semi-structured interviews in a sample subset with differing levels of adherence.
This study will fill critical gaps needed to identify those at risk of nonadherence for targeted support and inform
future clinically relevant interventions to improve OAM adherence, contribute to equitable health outcomes, and
inform adherence research for other cancer types."
10942472,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A transparent cornea that maintains its architecture and refracts light is essential for visual acuity. Despite
advances in corneal wound healing, individuals may develop blindness from scarring due to mechanical trauma,
while others may experience a decline in the quality of light they perceive due to dry eye diseases, diabetic
keratopathy, and neurotrophic diseases. Improper healing after corneal injury can result in decreased visual
acuity, photophobia, pain, tearing, and ulcerations. Severe, treatment-resistant corneal epithelial defects include
persistent corneal epithelial defect, estimated to cause 100,000 cases/year in the US, and recurrent corneal
erosion, estimated to cause 4.23 cases/10,000 person-years. Novel treatments for corneal epithelial defects are
urgently needed. The corneal epithelium is maintained by stem cells residing at the edge of the cornea in the
limbus. These cells, known as limbal stem cells, give rise to basal epithelial progenitor cells, which migrate toward
the central cornea and play a role in differentiation and stratification of the corneal epithelium to support
homeostasis. A recent mouse lineage tracing study demonstrated that basal epithelial cell migration from the
limbus is the initial step in central corneal wound healing, indicating that abnormal basal cell migration likely
contributes to persistent corneal epithelial defects. In addition, studies have shown that disruption of extracellular
matrix regulation, including the basement membrane, and focal adhesion molecules may be involved in recurrent
corneal erosion. Thus, basal epithelial cells and their interaction with the surrounding microenvironment play an
important role in maintaining a healthy corneal epithelium. We suggest that a critical balance in the heterogeneity
of basal epithelial cells is required to support homeostasis and wound healing. Our objective is to identify novel
therapeutic targets for corneal epithelial defects by revealing the differential roles of basal epithelial cells in the
central cornea, limbus, and conjunctiva in corneal health and wound repair. We hypothesize that basal epithelial
cells on the ocular surface have a specific molecular phenotype dependent on their location (central corneal,
limbal, or conjunctival) and that the cells in each location differently contribute to homeostasis and wound healing
of the corneal epithelium. The proposed study will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims. In Aim 1,
we will reveal the precise heterogeneity of ocular surface basal epithelial cells and the mechanism underlying
the transition from a limbal to central corneal cell phenotype. In Aim 2, we will determine the functional roles of
genes expressed in basal epithelial cells in the central cornea. In Aim 3, we will determine the functional roles of
genes expressed in basal epithelial cells in the limbus/conjunctiva. Our ultimate goal is to reveal the roles of
each of the basal epithelial cell subpopulations during homeostasis and wound healing of the corneal epithelium,
and identify new candidate targets for the treatment of severe corneal epithelial defects."
10943347,"Project Summary
 Sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias account for ~15-20% of all deaths worldwide. Voltage gated sodium
channels (Nav) in heart are major regulators of myocyte excitability and cardiac function. The Nav channel current
(INa) is a large amplitude and short duration inward current that is regulated by rapid channel activation and
immediate inactivation. However, a small late component of this current (INa,L) is present at baseline but increases
in response to heightened adrenergic challenge and has been correlated with fatal forms of congenital and
acquired arrhythmia. The majority of work on Nav1.5 has focused on molecular pathways for positive regulation
of INa,L. However, less is known about the pathways for negative regulation. These pathways are critical and can
be targeted to alter the pathogenic INa,L in potentially fatal forms of arrhythmia.
 My previous work identified a key pathway for INa,L regulation via the B56α regulatory subunit of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A). My previous and current data support that: 1) B56α co-localizes with Nav1.5 in the
heart at the intercalated disc, along with ankyrin-G and CaMKIIδ, 2) PP2A activity is regulated by the specific
regulatory subunit (B56α) and 3) activation of PP2A through modulation of B56α is sufficient to regulate Nav1.5
activity and resist the increase in INa,L following adrenergic challenge. Our work illustrates a key role of B56α in
INa,L regulation as well as the potential for targeting this pathway in arrhythmias. However, the field has been
limited by two key issues: 1) the lack of selective and inducible in vivo models to selectively impact key PP2A
regulatory proteins, and 2) the lack of molecules that selectively target PP2A activity in vivo.
 For this proposal, we have generated two novel tools to identify the impact of PP2A-B56α on cardiac action
potential and arrhythmias in vivo. First, we have created the first in vivo model to both constitutively as well as
inducibly impact local PP2A regulatory subunit (B56α) function, and thus cardiac PP2A activity. This model has
the impact in a field where work was limited to in vitro studies or non-selective activation or protein reduction.
Second, we have identified a new molecule to directly test the in vivo impact of PP2A activation in disease. Our
collaborators at Ohio State have synthesized a new molecule and have shown that this molecule increases
PP2A activity. Our preliminary data support our central hypothesis that PP2A, via the B56α regulatory subunit,
regulates the intercalated disc Nav1.5 to counteract CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in disease. Further, we
hypothesize that molecules that selectively modulate the PP2A-B56α holoenzyme will impact altered INa,L in heart
disease. Combining molecular, biochemical, pharmacological, patch clamping and Ca2+ imaging approaches,
we will: 1) define the functional role of PP2A-B56α signaling complex in primary myocytes, 2) determine the
effects of PP2A-B56α regulation on myocyte excitability, Ca2+ handling and cardiac function and 3) define the in
vivo impact of molecular activation of PP2A via B56α modulation in disease. Thus, this proposal will generate
critical information and will provide fundamental and clinically-relevant data for INa,L regulation and arrhythmias."
10943009,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bias is a significant contributor to health disparities and health inequities; and rises to the level of a public
health problem. Research has consistently shown that implicit bias effects the healthcare system, resulting in
differential outcomes: medical treatment care quality; patient-provider communication; and trust in the medical
system. Significant research has explored the impact that implicit bias has in medical settings, with studies
focused on physicians and nurses. There is, however, a gap in the evidence-base regarding oral health and
dentists.
Understanding the role that implicit bias plays in clinical dentistry—both in clinician decision-making
and in the recruitment/ retention of the oral health workforce—is essential to advancing health equity and
closing the gap in health disparities. This project’s objectives are to (1) assess the multi-level impact of implicit
bias on oral healthcare: clinician decision-making and the recruitment/retention of a diverse, oral health
research workforce; (2) to mitigate the impact of implicit bias and advance oral health equity through the
implementation of implicit bias interventions for dentists and psychosocial support for underrepresented
trainees. This project is a combination of research approaches and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and
Accessibility (DEIA) activities. The specific aims are to 1) determine the prevalence and impact of treatment
planning bias in a national sample of dentists; 2) identify and describe critical facilitators and barriers to
effective implicit bias training among dentists; and 3) demonstrate the effects of psychosocial barriers,
including implicit bias, on the recruitment of underrepresented groups to the dentist and oral health research
workforce. In this mixed methods approach of observational and interventional research design, rigor and
reproducibility comes from randomization of dentists to clinical vignettes of Black and white patients and time-
sequenced analysis of the impact of implicit bias training. Focus groups with underrepresented undergraduate
students participating in research pathway programs at dental schools will provide data to identify critical
facilitators and barriers to the recruitment and retention of an oral health workforce that is representative of the
U.S. population."
10932775,"IMPACT OF CANNABINOIDS ACROSS THE LIFESPAN (ICAL): SUMMARY
Teenagers use cannabis more than any other recreational drug. Their developing brains may also be especially
vulnerable to its effects, as epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that frequent cannabis use in
adolescence is associated with impairments in cognitive and affective functioning that continue in adult life.
Excessive stimulation of the endocannabinoid (ECB) system – the target of cannabis’s intoxicating constituent,
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – is a plausible but still poorly understood mechanism for the lasting
consequences of cannabis use. The NIDA Center Impact of Cannabinoids Across Lifespan (ICAL), whose
renewal is proposed in this revised application, combines molecular, synaptic, and behavioral approaches to
determine whether adolescent THC exposure (‘ado-THC’) alters ECB signaling in a persistent manner thus
causing impairments in adult brain function and behavior. In the first funding period, which lasted 4 years, we
made substantive progress on our research and service goals. Research: (1) We systematically characterized
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of THC in adolescent and adult mice and rats of both sexes and validated a
THC treatment protocol that models daily cannabis consumption (an increasingly common use pattern among
teenagers). (2) We found that this protocol produces enduring neurobehavioral alterations, most (but not all) of
which appear to be rooted in persistent disruption of microglial homeostasis. (3) We uncovered unexpected
modifications in the adult metabolic and immune phenotype of male and female ado-THC mice. (4) We
published 29 articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Cell Metabolism, Biological Psychiatry, Nature
Communications, and Nature Neuroscience. Service: we (1) organized 2 international symposia (>1600
participants), 5 research seminars, and 4 workshops/webinars; (2) created and launched a public biobank, which
in ~12 months of service distributed >500 ado-THC tissue samples to 6 laboratories worldwide; (3) trained 9
graduate students (5 from underrepresented minorities, URM), 5 post-docs (2 from URM), and 51 undergraduate
students (26 from URM); and (4) funded 7 pilot research projects. In this renewal, we propose to test the highly
innovative hypothesis that ado-THC alters ECB signaling in microglia and, by doing so, disrupts both their
homeostasis and their interactions with neurons, ultimately causing persistent (but possibly correctable)
alterations in neuroplasticity, episodic memory, and vulnerability to opioids. This hypothesis, which is supported
by rigorous preliminary data generated by the close cooperation of ICAL’s three Projects, will be tested in Aim 1
using emerging molecular techniques (e.g., single-nuclei RNAseq, imaging mass cytometry) along with state-of-
the-art electrophysiological and behavioral methods. In Aim 2, we will continue our service mission by (1)
organizing symposia and workshops to strengthen the cannabinoid research community and increase public
access to cannabis-related information; (2) expanding the public reach of ICAL’s biobank; and (3) attracting
early-career scientists to cannabinoid research by offering training opportunities and pilot funds."
10932780,"ICAL MOLECULAR PROJECT: SUMMARY
The Center of Excellence Impact of Cannabinoids Across the Lifespan (ICAL), the renewal of which is proposed
in this revised application, deploys a vertically integrated strategy that combines molecular, electrophysiological,
morphological, and behavioral approaches to test the hypothesis that adolescent cannabis use reprograms the
endocannabinoid (ECB) signaling system at the molecular and cellular level, producing persistent abnormalities
in its function and, ultimately, in cognition and motivated behavior. In the first funding period, the Molecular
Project showed that daily adolescent (not adult) exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produces in
male and female mice a lasting disruption of microglial homeostasis, which is prevented by co-
administration of a CB1 (not CB2) cannabinoid receptor antagonist and is characterized by suppressed
transcription of genes involved in host defense and by deficits in the responses to psychosocial stress
and microbial infection. Furthermore, the Project found that the ECB-degrading enzyme, FAAH, is
required for the establishment of this state. Importantly, experiments by the Synaptic and Behavioral Projects
showed that mice and rats treated with THC in adolescence exhibit profound and highly specific impairments in
synaptic plasticity, memory, and the rewarding properties of opioids, most (albeit not all) of which may also be
rooted in microglial malfunction. Working in close collaboration with other ICAL teams, the Molecular Project will
test two specific hypotheses: (i) the establishment of THC-induced microglial dysfunction is a cell-autonomous
process driven by FAAH expression in microglia; and (ii) once established, microglial dysfunction produces long-
term changes in neuronal gene transcription. We have three aims: (1) Characterize THC-induced FAAH
expression in microglia; (2) Determine whether THC-induced FAAH expression mediates microglial dysfunction;
(3) Examine the impact of THC-induced microglial dysfunction on neuronal transcription. A mechanistic
understanding of the lasting consequences of THC exposure will (i) guide the research activities of other ICAL
Projects; (ii) provide a mechanistic framework in which to interpret epidemiological datasets on the health impact
of adolescent substance use; and (iii) accelerate the discovery of medications aimed at correcting the
neurobehavioral consequences of teenage cannabis use."

Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) consistently upholds diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
as core values that infuse its leadership and membership as well as its scientific, clinical, and training activities.
To formalize this commitment, in 2022 Sylvester named Sophia George, PhD, as the inaugural Associate
Director (AD) DEI. In this role, George directs the Center’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI),
spearheading the Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) which provides a roadmap for evaluating and achieving the
Center’s DEI goals. She is supported in these efforts by Estelamari Rodriguez, MD, MPH, the Assistant
Director DEI, as well as the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (DEIC), a diverse, representative group of
faculty, staff, trainees, and community stakeholders, assembled by George. The Council provides guidance on
ODEI activities and helps identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Based on their input, George and
Rodriguez have identified initiatives to further promote a culture of inclusiveness at Sylvester by 1)
implementing new recruitment policies that include implicit bias training for leadership and search committee
members and a DEI resource toolkit to share with recruits (Aim 1 and 2); 2) supporting a travel award for
underrepresented minority (URM) and women to attend conferences and leadership workshops (Aim 3); and 3)
creating an intramural funding mechanism that specifically supports URM and women faculty (Aim 3). George
and Rodriguez regularly meet with Erin Kobetz, PhD, MPH, AD Community Outreach and Engagement and
Kerry Burnstein, PhD, AD Education and Training, to ensure DEI best practices reflect community input and
inform all Center workforce development activities, including creating new and sustainable programming for
diverse trainees, staff, and faculty to advance in their careers and assume leadership responsibilities. George
and Rodriguez work with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion,
and Community Engagement to leverage institutional resources and expertise, as appropriate, and facilitate
alignment with University-wide efforts to achieve inclusive excellence. As a result of these efforts, Sylvester
member and trainee demographics became more diverse during the current reporting period (6/01/2018 –
05/31/2023) and more closely aligned with the racial/ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic composition of the
catchment area (CA). In particular, Sylvester's female leadership increased by 12%, female membership by
4%, and Hispanic/Latino(a) membership by 5%. Staff and trainees also represent diverse backgrounds that are
aligned with CA demographics. With continued investment in DEI, Sylvester is poised to advance the NCI’s

10934073,"ABSTRACT
Efficient sensory processing requires the development of precisely wired circuits. Sensory deficits are common
in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), underscoring the importance of
proper wiring. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying precise sensory circuit wiring and the etiology of sensory
dysfunction in NDDs remain poorly understood, precluding development of effective therapies. To address these
gaps in knowledge, we have utilized the visual circuitry of the mouse superior colliculus (SC) to elucidate
fundamental mechanisms of circuit wiring and uncovered novel sub-circuit-specific visual deficits in FXS mice
(Fmr1-/y). In the parent proposal to this supplement, we focus on the mechanisms by which topographic maps of
space encoded by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye and Layer 5 neurons in primary visual cortex (L5V1)
are brought into alignment in the SC. Previous studies by us and others suggest that each stage of visual circuit
development in the SC - RGC mapping, visual map alignment, and circuit consolidation - is dependent on
neuronal activity; however, the mechanisms underlying each are poorly understood. Based on our previous and
preliminary data, we propose a model in which the activity-dependent mechanisms underlying each stage of
visual circuit development in the SC are distinct. We will test this model in three specific aims, leveraging a
unique combination of cutting-edge techniques and novel genetic mouse models. In this supplement, we will
focus on Aim 2 of the parent grant in which we will explore the region- and stage-specific roles of Fmr1, leveraging
anatomical tracing and in vivo electrophysiological methods. In addition, we will expand the scope of this aim to
determine the region- and stage-specific roles of Fmr1 in establishment of circuits regulating an innate behavior
regulated by the SC, namely prey capture. These studies will not only advance our understanding of circuit
assembly in the visual system and provide novel insights to sensory dysfunction in FXS, but also provide a rich
training opportunity for the candidate. Indeed, the candidate will learn several novel techniques to add to his
experimental toolbox, develop skills in data analysis, data presentation, and scientific communication, and build
professional skills and networks to help him launch a successful career in health-related research."
10943987,"Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the care of patients with metastatic
melanoma. Unfortunately, not all patients benefit from this therapy, and rational combinatorial
strategies to enhance ICI efficacy in therapy non-responders are needed. We and others have shown
that patients with liver metastases derive limited clinical benefit from ICI across a wide variety of
disease types. In preclinical colorectal and melanoma models, we discovered that liver metastases
cause immunotherapy resistance by siphoning tumor-specific T cells from systemic circulation.
Within the liver, activated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells undergo apoptosis. Consequently, liver
metastases create a systemic immune desert in preclinical models. Similarly, patients with liver
metastases have reduced peripheral T cell numbers and diminished tumoral T cell diversity and
function. In preclinical models, liver-directed radiotherapy eliminates immunosuppressive hepatic
macrophages, increases hepatic T cell survival, and reduces hepatic siphoning of T cells. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that liver SBRT address ICI resistance in melanoma patients with liver
metastases. We are now prospectively testing this strategy of combining liver SBRT with ipilimumab
and nivolumab in melanoma patients with liver metastases. We have recently determined that liver
metastasis is associated with a significant accumulation of neutrophils in the liver, and that this is
mirrored by significantly higher circulating neutrophils in metastatic melanoma patients with liver
metastases. We anticipate that maximal sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can only be
achieved by addressing both myeloid resistance mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will determine whether
liver SBRT combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab reverses hepatic and systemic neutrophil
dysfunction in our preclinical murine model by measuring number and function of circulating and
hepatic neutrophils, as well as assessing programs of myeloid signaling. In Aim 2, we will determine
whether liver SBRT modulates hepatic neutrophil purine metabolism and signaling to promote
immune responses in metastatic melanoma, and whether existing hepatic myeloid purine production
affects liver neutrophil accumulation. The completion of these aims will provide preliminary efficacy
measures of combination therapy and allow the development of biomarkers of response in preclinical
models of liver metastases. The ultimate goal of this work is to test rationally-developed novel
combination of radiotherapy and IC in hopes of improving the care of melanoma patients with liver
metastases who are resistant to immunotherapy."

The objective of this study, “Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS): Glaucoma and High Myopia”,
is to overcome barriers to the detection of open angle glaucoma (OAG) in individuals with high myopia
(mypOAG). In 2010, there was an estimated 1.4 billion people worldwide with myopia and the prevalence is
rapidly rising to an estimated 4.75 billion by 2050. Moreover, persons with high myopia are 2.5 times more
likely to have OAG than those without high myopia. It is unclear why myopia increases the risk of OAG, but it is
likely related at least in part to biomechanical factors; longer axial lengths in myopic eyes may result in
deformation of the lamina cribrosa, temporal displacement of Bruch's membrane, parapapillary changes and
vascular factors; these all lead to increased susceptibility of the optic nerve to OAG damage. Given the higher
prevalence of tilted discs and peripapillary atrophy in myopic eyes, the structural and functional tests that
usually guide treatment decisions are of diminished value. This proposal will provide essential follow-up to
establish best practices for patient-centered detection of OAG progression in the challenging high myopia
population. Specifically, this proposal will 1) identify optic nerve head (ONH) 3D morphologic parameters from
optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans (segmented and unsegmented) to differentiate between myopia
eyes with and without progressive OAG; 2) optimize change detection using novel OCT features (e.g. texture
and microvasculature) from wide field of view (WFOV) maps merged from individual ONH and macula scans;
and 3) develop novel longitudinal and multimodal deep learning (DL) models to predict OAG progression. Most
importantly, we will improve our understanding of the complex temporal relationship between structural,
functional and microvascular age- and OAG related changes in a diverse cohort across the range of myopia.
Specifically, in Specific Aim 1 (To improve our understanding of the complex relationship between ONH
morphology and structural, functional, and microvascular change in the aging and OAG eye), we address
several hypotheses related to the characterization of myopic ONH morphology in healthy eyes with and without
high myopia. We hypothesize that ONH morphology is predictive of age – and OAG related structural,
functional and microvascular changes and that it is predictive of fast progression. In Specific Aim 2 (To improve
detection of OAG progression in myopic eyes using WFOV maps, unsegmented 3D volumes, ONH
morphology), we address several hypotheses designed to detect and predict OAG progression using novel DL
approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a cloud-based pipeline for data curation and computation that
will facilitate secure DL model development and extensive data sharing with the vision research community."

The National User Resource for Biological Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (User Resource) will provide ultra-
sensitive isotopic analysis (primarily radiocarbon or Carbon-14) by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for
NIH-funded and other researchers. It will be the only User Resource of its type in the United States. The User
Resource will leverage 20 years of expertise in the development and application of AMS in broad-based
biomedical research through the Biomedical Technology Research Resource for the Development of
Biomedical Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (BTRRAMS): a NIGMS Biomedical Technology Center
(P41GM103483 09/01/2000 – 05/31/2020) that is in its final year of operation. Since June 2014, the
BTRRAMS has measured over 20,000 samples (4,000 a year) a year for its user community. The User
Resource will continue to meet the needs of current users as well as provide a capability for new users who
would benefit from incorporating AMS as a measurement tool into their research programs. The User
Resource’s forte will be ultra-high sensitivity quantitation of radiocarbon and selected other radioisotopes for
research studies where isotopes are required. Radioisotope labeling studies continue to be an important tool
for addressing many complex problems in the biomedical sciences. AMS is a specialized and unique type of
mass spectrometry that provides absolute quantitation of radiocarbon and relevant other isotopes with limits
of detection in real samples on the order of a few attograms/mg sample. As a National Resource, the most
significant work enabled by AMS is likely to be quantification of metabolic pathways in human health states
and comparison to ex vivo and in vivo animal models. The technology made available will enable a deeper
understanding of the etiology of human health concerns by (1) enabling the ability to quantify
pharmacokinetics and other molecular endpoints directly in humans; (2) offering the ability to conduct
quantitative studies using biologics such as proteins or lipids; and (3) enabling more relevant studies of
metabolic pathways in health and disease through the use of much lower, more biologically-relevant,
concentrations of metabolic substrates in cells and intact organisms. Such studies support NIGMS’s basic
biomedical research areas that contribute to the understanding of fundamental cellular and physiological
principles. The User Resource has three goals: (1) provide high throughput, ultra-sensitive 14C analysis for
the NIH user community ; (2) improve the efficiency of ultra-sensitive 14C analysis through installation of new
interfaces to our AMS systems, improvements in ion source efficiency and upgrades to our data analysis
codes; and (3) increase the accessibility and visibility of ultra-sensitive 14C measurements for the biomedical
research community by training new investigators and expanding the National user base of researchers
requiring ultra-sensitive 14C analysis."

This proposed supplement responds to the NIH goal of enhancing the diversity of the research workforce. The
supplement will provide support for Ms. Adjoa Manu, who will soon begin her third year as a PhD student in the
joint Oregon Health & Science University – Portland State University School of Public Health. Ms. Manu is an
African American woman who has experience as a research assistant on reproductive health projects in
Ghana. As a public health doctoral student, Ms. Manu now seeks to expand her research experience and
develop further expertise to prepare her for leading research projects of her own. Dr. Horner-Johnson,
Principal Investigator for the ongoing NICHD-funded project Understanding and Supporting Reproductive
Decisions Among Women with Developmental Disabilities that Affect Cognition (R01HD105655), will guide,
support, and mentor Ms. Manu in working toward her goal of becoming an independent researcher. Ms. Manu
will be co-mentored by Dr. Eden (co-investigator on R01HD105655) and by Dr. Cirila Estela Vazquez Guzman,
an experienced qualitative researcher focused on health of marginalized populations. To effectively support
and train Ms. Manu, Dr. Horner-Johnson and co-mentors have designed a two-year mentoring and career
development plan that includes structured training, active participation in the parent project, and execution of a
complementary research project to support and enhance the work of the parent project. Ms. Manu will build
quantitative and qualitative research skills by analyzing existing national survey data on feelings about
pregnancy and factors associated with those feelings among women with cognitive disabilities; exploring the
perspectives of developmental disabilities (DD) services providers regarding barriers and facilitators to
supporting women with DD-C in pregnancy planning; and obtaining feedback from DD services providers on a
prototype of an interactive decision aid to support pregnancy planning among women with DD-C. These aims
supplement the work of the parent project, which is designing a decision aid to promote active engagement in
informed reproductive decision-making among women with DD-C. We anticipate that working closely with DD
services systems will be a key strategy for future implementation of the decision aid. Findings from the
proposed aims will inform development and dissemination of the aid and help obtain buy-in from DD services
providers, who play an essential role in facilitating access to information and resources for many people with
DD-C."
10930153,"Using high resolution cryo electron microscopy (Cryo EM) we will investigate the mechanisms used by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to enter host cells by engaging the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). CVB3 is a human pathogen that causes myocarditis, pancreatitis, and has recently been linked to the onset of juvenile diabetes mellitus. Our proposed studies of CVB3 entry are a continuation of a productive previous granting period. Part of the previous work done was in collaboration with Dr. Jeffery Bergelson, Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital at Philadelphia, who has since retired. The proposed projects to continue studies of enterovirus entry include a collaboration with Konstantin Chumakov, FDA. Chumakov will work with us to explore one of the most promising results from the previous funding period, which was the discovery that a region in the CAR footprint onto the CVB3 capsid is conserved among three other viruses and their receptors, thus crossing four species using three different host proteins for entry. Further examination showed 1) the region is highly conserved among all human enteroviruses, including all three strains of poliovirus. 2) there are in total four different highly conserved regions. Previous work and our preliminary results link these conserved sites to functions linked to entry. Our structure/function studies will include testing each region for function and as targets for antivirals that are desperately needed. We will use both traditional icosahedrally averaged approaches along with asymmetric reconstruction approaches, some of which have been recently developed by us."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Nanopores have emerged in the past few years as promising single-molecule sensors. The basic
concept of nanopore sensing is to apply a potential across individual nanoscale pores embedded in
insulating material and observe the disruption of the ionic flow caused by single molecules entering
the pore. Ionic currents through protein pores have been utilized to recognize tiny differences in
molecules in solution. Most notably, arrays of thousands of nanopores integrated in low-cost and
portable devices are now capable of sequencing DNA at the single-molecule level. The main
challenge of nanopore sensing is the inability to control the transport of molecules across the
nanopore and to fabricate protein pores with a bespoke diameter and geometry that can recognize
individual amino acids.
The aim of this proposal is to design a new generation of protein nanopores with advanced
functionalities that will take on the next grand challenge of sequencing single proteins.
In order to sequence proteins, the designed nanopores must unfold a target protein, control the
speed of its transit across the nanopore and recognize individual amino acids. Our approach is to
bioengineer complex nanopore-device that will unfold target proteins and feed the linearized
polypeptide through the nanopore where single amino acids will be recognized by modulations of
the nanopore current. Alternatively, we will engineer the nanopore machine to cleave the polypeptide
at specific positions and the fragmented peptides will be read sequentially as they translocate across
the nanopore
The specific objectives are:
Control of transit: Supramolecular nanopore devices will be designed and engineered to integrate
one or more molecular machines that will unfold proteins and control their linearized transport across
a nanopore
Recognition: We will design new and engineer existing nanopores that will allow the stretching of
polypeptides as they are passing the nanopore and the recognition of amino acids and peptides.
Our nanopore devices will be used to develop the first technology to sequence full-length single
proteins. Compared to the state of the art ‘shotgun proteomics’, the nanopore approach will allow
long polypeptide reads, recognition of low-abundance proteins, including biomarkers linked to
diseases, and real-time monitoring with minimal cost, time and sample preparation.

10933665,"ABSTRACT
A commonly recognized mechanism of immune evasion in solid tumors is diminished MHC and antigen
presentation. Most cases retain some MHC expression, and strategies for upregulation may enhance
immunogenicity. Melanocyte development is regulated by the master transcription factor MITF which targets
virtually all components of the pigmentation machinery. This pathway is vulnerable to protein aggregation (e.g.,
after UV/tanning). MITF appears to simultaneously target certain “quality control” factors that protect against
misfolded species. We recently discovered MITF’s direct transcriptional regulation of a protease gene called
DDI2 which we found to participate in ER “quality control.” Unexpectedly, among the proteins degraded
downstream of DDI2, are MHC-I and MHC-II, leading to decreased antigen presentation. We believe this occurs
because peptide-MHC complexes may be “mis-perceived” as unfolded due to thermodynamic features of
peptide-MHC interactions. Importantly, we found that DDI2 suppression by gene knockout or drug, upregulates
MHC-antigen levels, producing functional stimulation of antigen-specific T cell activation, and enhanced tumor
killing both in vitro and in vivo (with anti-PD1) in multiple tumor types. The active sites of DDI2 and HIV-1 protease
coincidentally bear striking homology, and two FDA approved HIV protease inhibitors also block DDI2 (multiple
others do not). One of these, Nelfinavir (NF) is a well-tolerated drug, and potently phenocopies DDI2 knockout.
The combination of highly defined human and mouse melanoma models, which include antigen-specific MHC-
restricted matched CD8 and CD4 T cells, coupled to deep cellular, molecular, proteomic, immunophenotyping,
and tumor treatment assays, permit us to propose the following studies: Specific Aim 1 expands our evidence
that DDI2 suppression (knockout or drug) enhances anti-PD1 activity, by testing in complementary mouse
models, combinations of DDI2-KO or NF with anti-CTLA4, anti-LAG3, and 3-way combinations together with
anti-PD1, as these are FDA approved treatments. All will be scrutinized with detailed immunophenotyping,
MHC/peptidomics, and other expression assays. Specific Aim 2 examines immunopeptidomics: isolation and
sequencing of MHC-associated peptide antigens. This tests which antigenic peptides are increased by DDI2
suppression, as we hypothesize that DDI2 suppression rescues a more diverse peptide population, and may
boost T cell diversity (also to be tested by TCRseq). Specific Aim 3 probes MITF’s demonstrated direct
regulation of DDI2, predicting a pathway that links MITF to MHC-antigen levels and, thereby, to immune evasion,
which would be a novel and druggable oncogenic mechanism. Specific Aim 4 dissects data from >200 single
cell RNAseq of anti-PD1-resistant patients plus additional anti-PD1 sensitive ones, where we will determine DDI2
expression (RNA and protein) and use multiplex immunofluorescence to quantify MHC-I and -II levels— linked
to microenvironment immune populations and clinical annotation of responses. The goal is to determine features
of patients most likely to benefit from DDI2 suppression for enhanced immunotherapy responses."

Recent advances in single-cell genomic and high content spatial analysis technologies have shed new light on
organ and tissue composition, delineating complex tissues and identifying new cell types. However, the data
generated by these approaches are becoming increasingly complex. The High Dimensional Cellular and Spatial
Analysis Core (HDCSAC – Core C) will work with each project and the Biostatistics and Data Management Core
to facilitate the efficient use of single-cell sequencing, high-dimensional tissue imaging, including spatial-
transcriptomics, and will oversee the integrated exploratory analysis of high-dimensional datasets. In addition to
assisting in testing hypotheses generated by each of the projects, a major role for this core will be to use data-
driven approaches for discovery and hypothesis generation. The roles of this core will be split into three aims:
For Aim 1, we will support the efficient use of single-cell sequencing across projects. A major focus will be on
the use of the 10x Genomics 5’ capture immune profiling platform, which allows for simultaneous detailed
profiling of cellular protein (using oligonucleotide tagged antibodies, a.k.a. CITEseq), mRNA, and paired ⍺βTCR
sequencing.
For Aim 2, we will work with the Fred Hutch Experimental Histopathology core to coordinate multiplex-
immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data acquisition and analysis. We will also leverage our recent experience in the
use of new and emerging in situ spatial transcriptomics methods to enable novel hypothesis generation and
testing related to the detailed architecture of tumor microenvironment within the bone marrow.
Lastly, for Aim 3, we will support integrated analysis of flow cytometry and other high-dimensional datasets
generated by this Core and each program project."
10935391,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 4
A promising strategy for reducing toxicity and improving the efficacy of anticancer treatments involves combining
treatment with fasting regimens. Fasting is thought to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of treatment,
while protecting healthy cells by increasing stress resistance. In addition, fasting is associated with improved
metabolic health. The overarching goal of this project is to test time-restricted eating (TRE) during cancer
treatment in an understudied population at high risk for metabolic dysregulation. Alaska Native people suffer
disproportionately from metabolic disease and have the highest colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates
of any racial and ethnic group in the world. This proposed clinical trial builds on the research infrastructure of,
and lessons learned from, our P20 SPORE planning grant (P20CA252733) and our ongoing randomized clinical
trial of TRE in patients with rectal cancer (CHRONO Trial, R01CA258222, NCT04722341). While the CHRONO
Trial is recruiting racially and ethnically diverse patients in Los Angeles, CA and Birmingham, AL, it will unlikely
include any Alaska Native patients. We hypothesize that TRE may be more beneficial in the Alaska Native
community given their high rates of metabolic diseases. Therefore, in this SPORE Project we will conduct a
parallel randomized Phase II trial with a 1:1 (TRE:control) allocation ratio in 100 patients with rectal cancer
receiving neoadjuvant treatment at the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) which is part of the Alaska Native
Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC). ANTHC is the largest Native-owned health services organization in the U.S.,
providing comprehensive health care to >180,000 Alaska Native people. The intervention [TRE arm: 8 hours
eating / 16 hours fasting per day (6+ days a week); control arm: 12+ hour window of eating per day] will occur
during the treatment period (approximately 6 months). Our endpoints of interest are pathological complete
response (pCR), treatment-related toxicities, health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and adherence (Aim 1). We
hypothesize that TRE will enhance pCR rates, decrease treatment-related toxicity, and improve QOL compared
to the control arm and will be a feasible intervention with high adherence in this patient population. In Aim 2, we
will quantify therapy-induced DNA damage in leukocytes to evaluate TRE's mechanistic effects in protecting
healthy cells according to the differential stress sensitization theory. We also will evaluate differences in five
selected intermediate biomarkers related to metabolic function and cancer (IGF-1, IGF-B3, insulin, glucose and
CRP) and conduct an exploratory analysis of tumor tissue biomarkers using nanoString GeoMx®. In Aim 3, we
will compare findings among Alaska Native people with those from African American, Asian, Hispanic, and non-
Hispanic White individuals through a horizontal collaboration with the CHRONO Trial. The data garnered will
help determine the clinical utility of TRE among Alaska Native patients with rectal cancer, a population that
continues to experience considerable health disparities."

The Analytics Core will support all four research components of the TIME-AD program, ensuring coordinated
statistical approaches and principled decisions on common challenges. The Analytics Core will (1) work with
the Cognition, Exposure, and Covariates Core to ensure construction of analytic data sets is consistent with
each proposed study design for each research project; (2) partner with research project leads to develop and
implement the analytic strategy for each research project, develop template analysis code for each method,
and lead program-wide methodologic decisions; (3) guide investigative teams in each research project on
systematic evidence triangulation across study designs; (4) and provide ad hoc guidance on statistical
problems that arise in each research project. The TIME-AD program proposes to implement combinations of
multiple analyses of AD/ADRD risk factors, relying on different assumptions for causal identification. Methods
include doubly robust g-estimation methods using covariate adjustment; instrumental variables analyses
drawing on policy or genetic instruments; bias-detecting Mendelian Randomization; and quantitative bias
analysis. These approaches will be complemented by methods to quantify the total effect of interventions on
each risk factor on population incidence of AD/ADRD and inequalities in AD/ADRD. Population impact
assessments will include population attributable fraction calculations and effect estimate transport methods
that allow estimation of total effects in populations with different risk factor profiles. The team includes
researchers with expertise in each of these methods. The TIME-AD program uses data from multiple sources,
including population-representative cohorts with regularly scheduled measurement waves (Health and
Retirement Study, National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Disparities
in Stroke, National Health and Aging Trends Study) and cohorts relying on convenience (UK Biobank, All of
US) or membership-based (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) based samples with electronic health
record follow-ups. Together these data sets provide excellent statistical power to deliver precise estimates and
evaluate effects in racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups. The different data sources best support
different study designs, and each entails specific methodologic challenges. The Analytics Core will ensure a
unified framework, foster reproducible research and high-quality implementation, and make it feasible to tackle
these multiple designs with multiple data sets in each study. The Analytics Core will also work closely with the
Equity and Dissemination Core to ensure analytic decisions reflect the TIME-AD goal of delivering evidence
with the best chance to reduce AD/ADRD inequities and identify drivers of AD/ADRD in communities
historically underrepresented in AD/ADRD research. The Analytics Core will guarantee integration of the
projects and ensure success of the TIME-AD program."
10942775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching objective of this new R01 grant proposal is to perform preclinical drug development
studies to create potent, selective, metabolically stable, and peripherally restricted serine/threonine
kinase 33 (STK33) inhibitors that can provide a foundation as first-in-class non-hormonal contraceptive
drugs for men. Kinases are key enzymatic targets for drug inhibition in the pharmaceutical industry. However,
only ~70 of the 538 human kinases have FDA-approved inhibitor drugs or drug candidates. Therefore, a vast
number of therapeutic opportunities exist by targeting kinases. A subset of ~160 kinases are poorly understood
or studied and are designated as “dark kinases”. One of these dark kinases is STK33, which is testis-enriched
and expressed in spermatocytes through transformation of spermatids. Stk33 knockout males are sterile
secondary to teratozoospermia and sperm immotility, and men in a single family were discovered to have a
frameshift mutation in the STK33 gene, leading to infertility that phenocopied the knockout mice. Because mice
and men with these STK33 mutations are grossly normal, we hypothesize that STK33 is a pursuable target
with low safety risk for contraceptive inhibition in men. To discover STK33 probe or tool compounds for in vivo
chemical perturbation of STK33 function, we used DNA-Encoded Chemistry Technology (DEC-Tec) and
screened 3.9 billion unique DNA-molecules with human STK33 to identify high affinity binders. We created
several potent and selective kinase inhibitors, including CDD-2807, which showed picomolar biochemical
inhibition of STK33 (Kd = 20 pM) and nanomolar cellular inhibition of STK33 (IC50 = 9 nM) versus other kinases.
In a contraceptive fertility trial in mice, CDD-2807 induced reversible contraceptive effects in male mice without
causing any observable toxic effects or greatly altering testis size. Thus, our studies prove that STK33 is a
genetically and chemically validated contraceptive target and that CDD-2807 is a favorable lead chemical
probe suitable for in vivo studies of STK33 function. The Specific Aims are: 1) Use DEC-Tec screens,
medicinal chemistry, and X-ray crystallography to create more potent, selective, and metabolically stable
STK33 inhibitors; 2) Assess the metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties, tissue distribution, and safety of
STK33 inhibitors in mice and non-human primates; and 3) Evaluate the contraceptive effects of optimized
STK33 lead inhibitors in mice and non-human primates. Based on our preliminary studies and our
outstanding interdisciplinary team, which works at the intersection of mouse and non-human primate
reproductive biology, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, structural biology, drug metabolism, and
pharmaceutical discovery, these R01 studies are highly feasible, will allow us to create optimized lead
inhibitors of STK33 for an Investigational New Drug application, and will address an unmet medical
need for male contraceptive therapeutics."
10943578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are devastating primary brain tumors in children. Patient prognosis is abysmal
with median survival of ~9 months after initial diagnosis. DMGs are driven by recurrent lysine to methionine
mutations in histone H3 (H3K27M) that lead to widespread epigenetic dysregulation and oncogenic gene
expression. Pinpointing vulnerabilities induced by the H3K27M mutation has the potential to lead to precision
therapies for DMG patients.
Tumors reprogram metabolism to generate biosynthetic precursors for uncontrolled proliferation and to maintain
defense mechanisms. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) generates ribose-5-phosphate, which is a
precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis. It also generates NADPH, which maintains glutathione (GSH) in the
reduced state. GSH, in turn, is essential for glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) to detoxify methylglyoxal (MGO), a waste
product of glycolysis. Our studies with isogenic and patient-derived models indicate that the H3K27M mutation
transcriptionally upregulates G6PD and GLO1 expression in DMGs. Combined inhibition of G6PD and GLO1
using doxycycline-inducible shRNA or novel brain penetrant inhibitors is synergistically lethal in vitro and causes
tumor regression in vivo. Mechanistically, G6PD and GLO1 inhibition depletes nucleotides and causes
accumulation of MGO, leading to macromolecular glycation and apoptosis in DMGs.
Deuterium metabolic imaging is a novel, clinically translatable method of visualizing glucose metabolism in vivo.
Our studies indicate that MGO downregulates glycolysis by glycating phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1).
Importantly, lactate production from [6,6’-2H]-glucose is altered at early timepoints following G6PD and GLO1
inhibition when changes cannot be observed on anatomical imaging in DMG-bearing mice. Based on these
results, we will determine whether combined inhibition of G6PD and GLO1 abrogates DMG proliferation
(Aim 1) and [6,6’-2H]-glucose provides an early readout of response to therapy at 3T (Aim 2).
Our application is innovative because we identify, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, G6PD and
GLO1 as oncogene-induced metabolic vulnerabilities in DMGs. Our proposal is significant because we have
identified G6PD and GLO1 inhibitors that are synthetically lethal and have the potential for clinical translation.
Furthermore, we will validate [6,6’-2H]-glucose as an agent that can provide a biologically meaningful readout of
treatment response in vivo. We anticipate that our studies will provide the preclinical foundation needed to initiate
imaging-driven clinical trials of our G6PD and GLO1 inhibitors in DMG patients. In summary, our proposal will
develop metabolic therapy and imaging that can improve outcomes and quality of life for DMG patients."
10942998,"Project Summary:
Influenza is a major global health threat causing over half a million deaths each year. Certain virulent strains,
such as H1N1, can cause extensive lung damage, leading to dysplastic repair and the formation of Krt5+ basal
cell pods in the damaged alveolar. Despite their temporary barrier restoration capabilities, these basal cells fall
short in facilitating full tissue repair, resulting in the accumulation of dysplastic tissue and compromised lung
function. The abnormal repair process mirrors patterns seen in chronic lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accentuating the urgency to understand the
cellular and molecular mechanisms governing lung remodeling and repair. Using mouse models exposed to the
influenza A virus strain PR8, we and others have demonstrated that these nascent basal cells predominantly
originate from a rare subset of migratory airway cells. Furthermore, we found that Enhancer of Zeste 2 (Ezh2) is
marked upregulated in the hyperplastic basal cells post-PR8 infection. Conventionally, Ezh2, as the catalytic
subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has been recognized for its ability to repress gene
expression via the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3). However, these basal cells post-PR8
infection showed lower H3K27me3 levels compared to nearby cell types, aligning with low expression of other
PRC2 components like Eed. This implies a potential PRC2-independent function for Ezh2 in controlling basal
cell hyperplasticity. Additionally, Ezh2 deletion in airway epithelial progenitor cells led to marked reduction Krt5+
pod after PR8 infection. Moreover, we also observed a significant upregulation of Sox9 in the hyperplastic basal
cells post-PR8 infection. Sox9 deletion also led to reduction of the Krt5+ pod area mirroring Ezh2 deletion
phenotype after PR8 infection. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 resulted in suppressed Sox9 expression in basal
cells both in vivo and in vitro, suggested Ezh2 may serve as a transcription activator for Sox9. Based on these
data, our central hypothesis is that Ezh2 functions in a PRC2-independent manner to regulate basal cell
dynamics post-PR8 infection. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether the phosphorylation-mediated non-canonical
role of Ezh2 plays a regulatory function in basal cell dynamics following PR8 infection. In Aim2, we will identify
the unique gene targets of non-canonical Ezh2 and ascertain whether Sox9 serves as an integral downstream
effector in basal cells post-PR8 infection. In Aim3, discern the interacting partners external to the PRC2 complex
with which Ezh2 associates to exert its non-canonical role in basal cells post-PR8 infection. Additionally, we seek
to identify the factors that initiate these interactions and changes. Completion of these aims will provide
transformative insights into the mechanisms underpinning lung tissue remodeling post-influenza and the broader
implications for pulmonary medicine."
10943759,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are increasingly recognized as independent causes
of dementia, particularly due to their high prevalence and potential for intervention. Each year, nearly 795,000
Americans suffer a new or recurrent stroke, with one in three patients subsequently developing post-stroke cog-
nitive impairment and dementia (PSCID). Despite its enormous public health impact, the accurate estimation of
PSCID prevalence and the identification of associated risk factors face considerable challenges, including issues
related to data quality and research methodologies. Furthermore, many stroke survivors have co-existing cardi-
ovascular diseases. The extent to which additional vascular risk factors may interact with stroke in precipitating
PSCID remains unclear. Importantly, pharmacological management of vascular risk factors plays a pivotal role
in secondary stroke prevention. In theory, medications including antihypertensive, antithrombotics, and statin
may prevent PSCID through the prevention of recurrent ischemic events, yet there is limited evidence for specific
therapeutic strategies for PSCID prevention. Leveraging the nation’s largest stroke registry and Medicare data,
we propose to build a real-world data platform to advance PSCID research. Using this unique data resource,
which encompasses two million stroke records from over 2000 US hospitals, we will determine the incidence
and prevalence of PSCID, identify associated risk factors, and potential pharmacological targets for prevention.
The central hypotheses are that stroke survivors are at risk for cognitive impairment and dementia; the features
of the index stroke event, in conjunction with demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, in-hospital treatment,
and secondary stroke prevention may influence the risk of PSCID. The proposed research in innovative in four
key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach to address a major concern for stroke survivors and their caregivers;
2) A shift in focus from selected samples in single center studies or small cohort to encompass nationwide diverse
stroke populations; 3) Innovative utilization of instrumental variable analysis, which mimics a trial-type design
within observational data; 4) Rapid dissemination through professional societies and patient-led initiatives. The
proposed research is significant, because it addresses a high-priority area for aging research highlighted in the
National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease. As the number of stroke survivors living with dementia continues
to increase, obtaining the incidence and prevalence of PSCID will provide a more accurate estimate of disease
burden. This, in turn, will inform the development of appropriate policy and the allocation of healthcare resources.
From a clinical practice perspective, knowledge gained from this study will enhance our understanding of post
stroke medical management and care planning needed by stroke survivors. Importantly, since both stroke and
vascular risk factors are preventable and treatable, the identification of contributing factors, particularly modifia-
ble ones, will be critical for the development of personalized prevention strategies and targeted interventions
aimed at alleviating the burden of cognitive impairment and dementia among stroke survivors in our aging society."
10942945,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our current vaccine development strategies against tuberculosis (TB) focus on the induction of adaptive immune
responses, but that may not be sufficient to mount effective immunity. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resides
in heterogenous lung macrophages with various levels of permissiveness in the presence of the same immune
pressure. Among them, lung alveolar macrophages (AMs) are highly permissive cells, which facilitate rapid
growth of Mtb and promote disease dissemination at the early stage of infection. However, the underlying
mechanism that determines this permissive nature of AMs during Mtb infection remains elusive. Identifying
determinants regulating the response of AMs to Mtb is thus essential for the development of new therapeutics
and novel vaccine platforms. While AMs are derived from embryonic precursors in naïve mice, they can be
replaced by bone marrow-derived monocytes during infection. It is unknown whether the origin of AMs change
and how the altered ontogeny impacts the permissiveness and functions of AMs during Mtb infection. In addition
to ontogeny, our previous work has demonstrated that lung macrophage metabolism plays a critical role in
promoting or controlling the progression of TB. AMs consume fatty acids and engage in fatty acid oxidation
(FAO), a pathway that has been associated with the optimal growth of Mtb. Given that both ontogeny and
metabolism play pivotal roles in modulating how macrophages respond to Mtb infection, we hypothesize that
ontogeny and metabolism are intrinsic features that regulate the permissiveness of AMs during Mtb infection.
We further propose that harnessing these two features will allow the reprogramming of AMs for better control of
Mtb at the early stage of infection. We will test this hypothesis with three aims: Aim 1. Determine how ontogeny
contributes to the response of AMs during Mtb infection. Aim 2. Delineate how glycolysis and FAO differentially
regulate the permissiveness of AMs during Mtb infection. Aim 3. Reprogramming AMs by leveraging their
ontogeny and metabolism against Mtb infection. To address these aims, we will exploit multi-disciplinary
approaches, including immunology, metabolism, genomics, microbiology, novel mouse models and human
primary AMs to directly probe how ontogeny and major metabolic pathways regulate the permissiveness of AMs
during Mtb infection. Knowledge gained from these studies is expected to provide a better understanding of the
mechanism regulating AM response to Mtb, which opens the gate for reprogramming AMs for enhanced control
of Mtb at the early stage of infection as well as aiding in development of host-directed therapies against TB."

10942017,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over 50% of youths with type 2 diabetes (Y-T2D) develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) during adolescence,
increasing the risk of early dialysis and death. Latinx and African American youth are disproportionately affected
but under-studied, and current treatment options for T2D in adolescents, projected to dramatically increase over
the coming decades, are limited. Thus, it is critically important to identify modifiable risk factors and novel
therapeutic approaches for preventing DKD in youth. Our strong preliminary data links per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS), a group of ubiquitous artificial chemicals used for more than 60 years in consumer and
industrial products, with kidney injury in proximal tubules in Y-T2D, a key component of DKD. PFAS toxicity in
proximal tubules may be partly due to organic anion transporters (OATs) localized to these cells; Tubular OATs
reabsorb PFAS from urine filtrate, concentrate PFAS in tubular cells, and decrease renal PFAS clearance,
potentially amplifying PFAS associated nephrotoxicity. Our overarching biological hypothesis, supported by our
preliminary data, is that PFAS increases tubular injury and DKD risk and that decreasing OAT reabsorption in
proximal tubules may mitigate this risk. This first of its kind study will examine this hypothesis by building on
existing data in two independent, meticulously phenotyped, longitudinal cohorts of youth with T2D of
predominantly Latinx or African American race/ethnicity. To identify associations and potential therapeutic
targets, we will leverage the NIDDK-funded Renal Hemodynamics, Energetics, and Insulin Resistance in Youth
Onset Type 2 Diabetes Study (Renal-HEIR/HEIRitage). This study has existing measures of OAT activity
measured using single cell RNA sequencing from kidney biopsies at baseline and gold-standard PAH clearance,
a measure of tubular OAT function, in addition to existing outcome data, including tubular injury biomarkers,
albuminuria, and hyperfiltration at both visits. To examine associations in a larger cohort with annual visits and
longer follow-up duration, we will leverage the NIH/NIDDK funded TODAY/TODAY2 study, the largest
longitudinal cohort of youth with T2D with comprehensive measures of kidney function (e.g., annual visits for 15
years) with the same outcomes as Renal-HEIR. In both cohorts, we will assess PFAS exposure and clearance
by measuring longitudinal serum PFAS and urine PFAS at baseline; we will assess biomarkers of OAT function
in urine and plasma and address reverse causality using pharmacokinetic (PK) models. We will use innovative
statistical approaches, including a latent unknown factor analysis to identify how OAT activity associates with
changes in PFAS over time, and a novel causal inference and mediation framework based on latent factors to
examine whether decreases in OAT activity, induced by sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, decrease the
risk of DKD via alterations in renal PFAS clearance. This groundbreaking study will deepen our understanding
of the interplay between OATs, PFAS, and DKD in youth with T2D and inform targeted clinical interventions to
prevent PFAS associated DKD, particularly in marginalized communities."
10942450,"The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak underscores the need for understanding viral-host interactions that impact host gene expression and antiviral responses. A critical virulence factor of coronaviruses is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1). We uncovered a previously unknown mechanism of Nsp1- mediated inhibition of host antiviral responses: Nsp1 targets the cellular mRNA nuclear export pathway. Nuclear export of cellular mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is obligatory for eukaryotic gene expression including those genes encoding antiviral factors. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA synthesis takes place at viral transcriptional factories in the cytoplasm. We have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein inhibits host mRNA nuclear export by targeting the cellular NXF1-NXT1 complex, a receptor required for mRNA translocation through the NPC to the cytoplasm. We identified mutations in Nsp1 that specifically reduce its binding to NXF1- NXT1. Importantly, a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus carrying a mutant Nsp1 deficient in NXF1-NXT1 binding is unable to inhibit mRNA nuclear export and is attenuated in cells and in mice. Together, our data indicate that Nsp1 is a regulator of host mRNA nuclear export via blocking NXF1 function, overcoming cellular antiviral responses. This proposal combines the synergistic expertise between the principal investigators in biochemistry, cell biology, structural biology, and viral pathogenesis to investigate in depth the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein function as inhibitor of mRNA nuclear export and its impact on the virus life cycle and on virulence. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical, genetic, and imaging approaches to determine the interactions within the mRNA export machinery that lead to Nsp1 inhibition of mRNA export. In addition, we will use a combination of biophysical and structural biology approaches to determine the molecular basis for the recognition between Nsp1 and NXF1-NXT1. These findings will uncover new mechanisms that mediate or regulate cellular mRNA nuclear export and how they are targeted by SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 2, we will assess the functions of the Nsp1-NXF1 interaction during virus replication and pathogenesis. We will generate loss-of-function recombinant viruses carrying Nsp1 mutants defective in NXF1 binding and investigate the impact of these mutations on host mRNA export, viral replication, induction of host responses in infected cells, and on viral pathogenesis in two animal models, mice and hamsters. Additionally, Nsp1 polymorphisms associated with new variants of concern have been found. We will therefore address the functional significance of these polymorphisms for the Nsp1- NXF1 interaction and for viral pathogenesis. Moreover, we will identify the host mRNAs whose nuclear export are impacted by Nsp1 and determine their role in antiviral response. These extensive studies will likely not only define novel virulence function(s) of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, but also shed light on novel antiviral defense mechanisms. Since antagonizing Nsp1 function results in expression of mRNAs encoding antiviral factors, our proposed studies may uncover new strategies for designing antivirals against SARS-CoV-2."
10942815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Keratinocytes, the major building block of skin epidermis, are the primary target of herpes simplex virus (HSV)
infection as well as the mediator of local environmental cues, including those directed by CD8 tissue resident
memory T cells (TRM) at the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ). The ability of keratinocytes to relay and amplify
TRM immune signals could dictate the epithelium resistance or susceptibility to HSV infection and ultimately
affect the outcome of HSV manifestation. Genital HSV-2 is a disease of global importance. There are an
estimated 4 million incident HSV-2 infections yearly, with 572,000 in the US. HSV-2 is the underlying
attributable risk in 30% of the incident 1.5 million HIV infections yearly. HSV-2 disease varies widely among
individuals, ranging from disease free to infrequent and short-lasting recurrences to frequent and severe
ulcerations. Subclinical shedding occurs commonly and frequently. The molecular mechanisms underpinning
varied host responses to HSV-2 reactivation in genital skin are poorly defined. Understanding host-viral
interactions, with the goal of enhancing responses to rapidly eliminate viral infection at the site of HSV-2
release before local viral dissemination, is the key to developing novel interventions and a successful vaccine.
We have shown that CD8 TRM constitute the frontline of defense at the barrier surface. Our recent studies
indicate CD8 TRM at the DEJ communicate with surrounding keratinocytes via IFN-γ to enhance their cell-
intrinsic and innate antiviral responses through IFN-stimulated gene pathways. These observations alter the
canonical belief that communication only goes from innate to adaptive immunity and suggest the reverse also
occurs. This proposal is designed to dissect the cross talk between TRM and the surrounding epithelium and
the microenvironmental signals that dictate the recruitment and function of CD8 TRM using sequential genital
skin biopsy tissue in humans. By applying state-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptome
analysis and highly multiplexed imaging technology, we aim to identify cellular and immunological
characteristics that distinguish between effective vs defective antiviral responses and can be targeted for
modification and manipulation to enhance immunity at the peripheral tissue. Findings generated in this study
will provide rationale for eliciting optimal local immune responses and for development of a functional cure for
HSV-2 recurrent disease in humans."

 With this competitive renewal application, we are seeking five years of support for a Training Program with
the new Title of “Physician Scientist Training in Cancer Research” that has been continually funded since
1975. Since that time, more than 600 physicians and physician-scientists who were part of fellowship training
programs in medical oncology received, through this funding mechanism, the essential support and protected
time that they required to launch an academic career. Of the 117 trainees who have been supported by this
T32 Award during the past 15 years, 13 continue as post-doctoral fellows in training. Of the remaining 104, 10
have left academia to pursue leadership positions in industry focused on cancer medicine, 6 are clinicians at
major medical centers, 2 hold positions at the National Cancer Institute, and the remaining 86 are in academic
positions including 2 Professors, 22 Associate Professors, 39 Assistant Professors, and 23 Instructors.
Excluding fellows still in training, 90 former trainees of the remaining 104 have received external funding for
their research including 37 that have been awarded an individual NIH K-type award. With the present
application, we seek to continue this tradition of training the leaders in academic oncology.
 The future of cancer research will continue to depend on the continued training of highly-talented and
creative physician-scientists who possess an understanding of the clinical aspects of neoplastic disease, are
able to apply these concepts to appropriate laboratory studies within the many areas of tumor biology and
emerge as academic leaders with sufficient skills to direct research programs, patient care, and educational
efforts. The development of such individuals can only be accomplished within an environment where
physicians and scientists work in physically adjacent areas, exchanging ideas and collaborating on a wide
array of endeavors. The program will build on a foundation of excellence in Medical Oncology established
during clinical training in the Dana-Farber/Massachusetts General Brigham Medical Oncology Fellowship
Program. All of these candidates have already received an MD or MD/PhD degree, completed 2 or 3 years of
Internal Medicine residency, and at least one year of clinical training in Medical Oncology.
 The training grant program will select the most highly qualified candidates from this pool who wish to
pursue laboratory research or clinical investigation at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute or nearby surrounding
institutions. The program will provide outstanding mentored laboratory and clinical investigation research
experiences from senior and experienced junior faculty and support for the recruitment and mentorship of
under-represented minority fellows. It is expected that at the conclusion of their training, those individuals
supported by this training program will have the ability to design, initiate, and complete individual clinical or
laboratory research projects, will be able to function independently or with minimal supervision, and will be
positioned to soon establish themselves as independent research investigators."
10943152,"Project Summary
Chronic Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is associated debilitating pain and dysfunction of the muscles of
the jaw, the temporomandibular joints, and related structures. TMD pain is highly prevalent, impacting ~5-12%
of the general population and over 20% of individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder. Moreover,
treatments for chronic pain conditions like TMD, such as opioid analgesics, are relatively ineffective, rarely
meet patients’ own criteria for successful treatment, and are associated with significant risk. Therefore, many
patients seek alternative, maladaptive methods for pain relief, including self-medication with alcohol. Twenty-
five percent of treatment seeking people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) report past-month pain, and 25% of
chronic pain patients report heavy drinking. However, the effects of pain on alcohol consumption behavior in
heavy drinkers with chronic TMD pain are poorly understood. Despite the need for empirical investigations of
the effect of pain on naturalistic drinking behavior, previous work has not directly addressed this question. We
address this gap in knowledge by assessing the effect of pain on the microstructure of individual drinking
bouts, known as drinking topography (DT). The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of
pain on DT in community-dwelling heavy drinkers with and without chronic TMD pain both in the laboratory and
in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In the laboratory, we will use the Integrated
Topography and Consumption Tracking in Virtual Reality (INTACT VR) platform to provide a highly-controlled
drinking environment, increasing study rigor and reproducibility. In contrast, EMA provides high ecological
validity and the ability to ascertain whether pain-related DT patterns in the laboratory are also observed in the
real world. Importantly, our approach is informed by the Catastrophizing, Anxiety, Negative Urgency, and
Expectancy (CANUE) model, a theoretical moderated-mediation model regarding modifiable psychosocial
factors underlying pain as an antecedent for substance use. The results of this study will provide mechanistic
information regarding the effect of pain on alcohol consumption in heavy drinking individuals with chronic TMD
pain, as well as actionable information regarding modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for potentially
hazardous alcohol use associated with pain self-management. This knowledge will facilitate optimization of
interventions to reduce alcohol-related consequences in people with chronic TMD pain. Such interventions can
potentially also have indirect benefits on chronic pain given evidence that hangover and alcohol withdrawal are
associated with increased pain severity."
10941686,"Project Summary
My research group combines traditional molecular biology approaches with microfluidic technology to
examine how host-relevant shear flow impacts stress responses and surface adhesion of the human
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While reductionist experimental systems provide great
mechanistic insight, they commonly lack key aspects of natural systems, such as fluid flow. Thus, there
is a great opportunity to solve outstanding problems in microbiology by implementing experimental
systems that more precisely model natural conditions. Two major recent discoveries from my lab
highlight the scientific opportunities of studying bacteria in flow. First, we discovered that flow sensitizes
P. aeruginosa to host-relevant doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Second, we discovered that host-
relevant shear forces counter-intuitively enhance P. aeruginosa adhesion by counteracting pilus-driven
surface departure. Over the next five-year funding period, we will use our microfluidic platform to build
on these discoveries and investigate three key research gaps: how spatial H2O2 gradients impact
bacterial communities (Project 1), how temporal dynamics of H2O2 stress responses are regulated in P.
aeruginosa (Project 2), and how type IV pilus retraction promotes surface departure of P. aeruginosa in
flow (Project 3). These projects will provide mechanistic answers to questions related to the basic
biology of P. aeruginosa and will lay a clear foundation for innovative advances in the treatment of
bacterial infections."
10930305,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in US women, accounting for approximately one of
every three female deaths. Obesity is arguably the strongest modifiable target for interventions to prevent CVD
and is linked with nearly every other major CVD risk factor, including hypertension, elevated glucose, high
cholesterol, poor diet, and physical inactivity. Infants of mothers with obesity are also at increased risk for
future obesity and CVD. Our team has developed an empirically validated lifestyle intervention that is remotely
delivered and highly successful in reducing body weight and improving CVH in Hispanic and non-Hispanic
women and children during pregnancy and postpartum. It is now critical to study ways to disseminate this
empirically-validated program. Evidence based home visiting programs (EBHV), which support families from
the prenatal period through infancy and early childhood, are an ideal setting to promote CVH, however these
programs were not designed with an explicit focus on the prevention of obesity and other CVD risk factors. The
proposed research will test the effectiveness of our pre- and postnatal lifestyle intervention as an enhancement
to EBHV to promote maternal and child CVH. During an initial 2-year UG3 phase, we will: 1) modify our pre-
and postnatal intervention to focus on CVH within EBHV; 2) Work with our EBHV partners to integrate CVH
messages and develop their related skills; 3) Strengthen partnerships between healthcare providers and EBHV
to increase referrals, retention, and improve CVH, and 4) Contribute to the development of a high-impact study
design for the subsequent UH3 phase involving a multi-cohort protocol, harmonized interventions, measures
and resources. For the subsequent UH3 phase, we propose a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial
in which we recruit 550 perinatal women who will be randomized to receive EBHV alone or EBHV enhanced
with our lifestyle intervention to promote CVH. Our primary hypothesis is that, over an average of 36 months,
EBHV+CVH (vs. EBHV alone) will result in more favorable maternal and child levels of the Life’s Simple 7
indicators. We will also examine key intervention moderators, focusing on social determinants of health, and
mediators, including changes in the home environment, social support, CVH behaviors, and program
adherence. Using the RE-AIM framework, we will determine reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation,
and maintenance of EBHV+CVH vs. EBHV alone. Other goals are to empower and reduce burnout among
home visitors; develop skills of early-stage investigators, and propose innovative ancillary studies to enhance
the scientific contributions. Our team is exceptionally well positioned for this research and includes established
investigators with decades of experience conducting NIH funded research, outstanding early stage
investigators, and EBHV sites from Central California and Rhode Island."

 Nonlinear Imaging
 Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) has enabled in vivo studies on the function of neuronal
circuitry. However, the penetrating depth of traditional TPLSM is limited to around 400 µm in brain tissue due to
scattering and aberration, which limits its application in deep cortical layers and highly scattering white matter.
The goal of the parent U19 proposal is to understand medullary circuits and how they can be autonomous but
subject to high-level activation and temporal organization from motor cortex and superior colliculus. This requires
using our Direct Sensing Adaptive Optics TPLSM (AO-TPLSM) to perform diffraction-limited resolution imaging
of scattering and/or deep structures.
 This technology is fundamental to the goals of Project 1 to image through the scattering tissue of
brainstem and through the upper layers of superior colliculus to reach the deep motor layers of superior colliculus.
 This Core will assist with the transfer of adaptive optics two-photon microscope technology from UCSD
to MIT and to Johns Hopkins. It holds the promise to enhance discovery through Project 3, where AO-TPLSM
is essential to image scattering tissue such as brainstem (MIT), and Project 5, where AO-TPLSM is essential to
image cellular and synaptic functions in deep regions of cortex (Johns Hopkins). The Core will maintain travel
funds for Liu.
 The Core will arrange for the purchase of components for this custom microscope, from which
subassemblies will be constructed at UCSD. The MIT and Hopkins performance sites are responsible for
upgrading and maintaining their own appropriate fiber 100-fs laser. Our approach will achieve uniformity and
consistency in technology across all three performance sites using AO-TPLSM. The use of identical and, as
much as possible, standard commercial components will maximize reliability, optimize debugging, and minimize
retraining of junior investigators that collaborate across sites."
10931984,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive
decline and dementia. It accounts for approximately two-thirds of all dementia cases, and its pathogenesis may
predate its clinical manifestations by decades. With ~44 million patients worldwide, AD is placing an everincreasing
burden on long-term well-being, healthcare costs, and family life. Despite more than fifty years of
research, no cures exist, and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory; available therapies only partially
alleviate select clinical symptoms. Decades of genetic research have demonstrated the high heritability of AD,
and identified dozens of genetic variants that are associated with AD, but it has not been straightforward to
connect these to disease mechanisms. Disentangling the impact of the normal aging process on disease risk
and progression is not straightforward and has hampered efforts to develop effective treatment or prevention
strategies for AD. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will leverage and integrate large-scale epigenomic and
transcriptomic datasets from multiple consortia and projects to develop a cell-type specific regulatory network
model for normal brain aging and AD brain aging (Aim 1), while we simultaneously generate the first empirical
dataset to resolve AD risk regulatory loci with differential activity in donor-matched ""young"" and ""old"" human
neurons and microglia (Aim 2). Reciprocal use of computational and experimental models will benchmark the
extent to which we can recapitulate the hallmarks of AD brain aging in silica and in vitro (.R21 Milestone). In the
R33 phase of this proposal we will model the epigenetic regulation of gene expression changes in brain aging
and AD progression (Aim 3) and conduct an unbiased examination of the role of human brain cell aging in AD
risk, validating age-dependent regulatory activity and resolving convergent downstream impacts of ADassociated
variants and drivers of aging (Aim 4). Our objective is to couple emerging computational and
experimental approaches to refine in silica and in vitro experimental models of aging, towards resolving how
aging processes initiate and/or increase genetic risk for AD (R33 milestone). Overall, we test the hypothesis
that aging-related processes and AD-associated risk variants independently alter chromatin
accessibility and gene expression, acting in a combinatorial manner to drive aberrant cell type-specific
function in AD. We propose to predict and measure the molecular and functional effects of aging on neural and
glia function. Our hope is that this work may identify novel therapeutic points of intervention, in order to prevent
or slow disease course in individuals with AD."

10935867,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
The incidence of NASH-driven HCC is expected to increase worldwide due to its association with the obesity
and type-2 diabetes epidemic. Chronic ER stress and overnutrition synergize to drive NASH-HCC and metabolic
stress affects ER and mitochondrial function through mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). SAB
(SH3BP5) and STARD1, two mitochondrial-resident proteins induced by ER stress, contribute to ER-
mitochondria crosstalk in acute liver injury. STARD1 transfers cholesterol to the mitochondrial inner membrane
for metabolism to bile acids (BAs) in the alternative (acidic) pathway. SAB acts as a docking protein required for
sustained p-JNK activation through mitochondrial dysfunction and an amplification of reactive oxygen species
generation. Although basal levels of STARD1 and SAB are low, their expression increases in human NASH-
HCC samples. We hypothesize that SAB and STARD1 act as complementary partners and downstream
mediators of the NRF2/ATF6/FBP-1 loss network to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic
reprogramming through the switch of BAs synthesis from the classic to the alternative pathway. Specific aims:
Aim 1. How does STARD1-SAB/JNK promote NASH-driven HCC? We hypothesize that STARD1-SAB/JNK
alters BA homeostasis leading to HCC development. 1.1. How does BAs generated through the alternative
pathway lead to loss of FBP-1? 1.2 What is the effect of STARD1-SAB-JNK ablation on BAs and FBP-1 expression
in human HCC PDXs/spheroids? 1.3 Determination of the tumorigenic potential of HCC cell lines from MUP-
uPA/NRFAct-Hep mice. Aim 2. How does STARD1-SAB/JNK axis alter the lipid composition of
MAMs/Mitochondria and cause ER stress to promote NASH-driven HCC? We hypothesize that STARD1
regulates mitochondrial cholesterol content and SAB/JNK changes MAM lipid composition via MFN-2
degradation, leading to metabolic reprogramming for HCC. 2.1 Determination of the lipidome of
MAMs/Mitochondria from MUP-uPA/NRF2Act-Hep-derived HCC and the role of STARD1-SAB/JNK knockdown.
2.2 Analyze MAM/mitochondrial lipid composition in human HCC PDXs/spheroids. 2.3 How does ER stress
induce STARD1-SAB expression to promote HCC? Aim 3. How does STARD1-SAB/JNK metabolic
reprogramming lead to NASH-driven HCC? We postulate that STARD1-induced cholesterol trafficking and
SAB-mediated JNK activation suppress oxidative phosphorylation, increase glycolysis and impair mitophagy to
favor HCC development. 3.1 Determination of mitochondrial function, glycolysis and mitophagy in MUP-
uPA/NRFAct-ΔHep mice. 3.2 Examination of mitochondrial function and glycolysis of HCC cell lines and human
PDXs/spheroids. 3.3 Impact of STARD1-SAB/JNK in stabilization of HIF-1. Thus, it is anticipated that the
integration of our work with Projects 1 and 2 and Cores 1 and 2 will advance our understanding of HCC
pathogenesis and lead to new therapeutic approaches."

The Center for Targeted Therapeutics (CTT) was established in 2014 at the University of South Carolina (USC),
with the mission to develop the institutional research in the area of experimental therapeutics aimed at molecular
targets implicated in different pathologies. The Center has been transformative for translational biomedical
research at USC. In phases 1 and 2, CTT has supported the research and mentoring of 15 junior faculty from
several different Colleges who served as Research Project Leaders (RPL). Subsequently the RPLs have won
13 R01s and several smaller grants; 11 of them have been promoted to Associate or full Professor. In addition,
23 pilot projects were funded, with the pilot project leaders (PPL) subsequently winning 4 R01s and several
smaller grants. Subsequent to CTT funding, the RPLs and PPLs published more than 300 articles and won over
$50M in external funding, filed multiple patents and brought their drug candidates into the clinical trial pipeline.
The CTT supported the recruitment of 9 junior faculty members and engaged at least three SmartState Endowed
Chairs related to Targeted Therapeutics. CTT supports the operation of three resource cores: Functional
Genomics, Microscopy and Flow Cytometry, and Drug Discovery Synthesis, that provide state-of-the-art services
to investigators at USC and the State of SC. At the onset of COVID19 pandemic, the Functional Genomics core
rapidly developed the SARS-Cov2 testing pipeline that, in the form of a CLIA lab, served the USC community
throughout the pandemic. CTT also sponsored a special Pilot Project program in COVID19 therapeutics. During
Phase 3, CTT will transition to self-sufficiency and sustainability, leveraging the progress attained so far by
pursuing the following activities: 1). Support high-impact research projects in Targeted Therapeutics, by
funding pilot projects, identifying scientific priority areas, and promoting collaborations in the area of Targeted
Therapeutics. The pilot project awards will prioritize junior faculty, collaborative studies and the workforce
diversification by engaging investigators that belong to or serve underserved groups. 2). Maintain and grow
sustainable research infrastructure by supporting three strategic resource Cores: the Functional
Genomics Core, the Drug Design and Synthesis Core, and the Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Core. 3). Assure
long-term development of the CTT by broadening collaborative networking in Targeted Therapeutics.
For this purpose, CTT will conduct Center meetings, arrange scientific seminars and promote external
collaborations. CTT will also organize individual training and workshops aimed at developing multi-investigator
and SBIR/STTR grant applications. CTT will work in alignment with Institutional priorities at USC to assure the
sustainability of CTT research cores’ operation and continuous engagement and expansion of the critical mass
of Targeted Therapeutics investigators that has been established during Phases 1 and 2. The CTT will promote
the mission of the NIH IDeA program and will enhance the State's stature in Targeted Therapeutics research,

infrastructure for biospecimen collection, processing, analysis, and access across all participating institutions.
This one-of-a-kind resource will fill a significant gap in the availability of biospecimens from racially and ethnically
diverse colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who experience vastly different CRC incidence and mortality rates. The
BPC will enable access to state-of-the-art laboratory technologies and provide expertise in tissue-based assays
and biomarker analyses. Through multi-institutional efforts, Aim 1 will build a high-quality CRC biospecimen
repository from well-annotated racially and ethnically diverse populations that includes blood, fresh frozen and
formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor and normal tissue, saliva, urine, and stool. IRB and Tribal
approvals, and institutional agreements are in place to ensure rapid execution. In Aim 2 we will process,
evaluate, store, and track all biospecimens. The BPC will provide centralized pathology review, standard
biospecimen processing, H&E staining, development of tumor microarrays and digital imaging. We will conduct
DNA extraction, and single cell preparation. These biospecimens will be used by the four SPORE projects and
be available for Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and Developmental Research Program (DRP) projects,
and outside collaborations. Aim 3 will focus on data collection to acquire and harmonize demographic, lifestyle,
clinical, social determinants of health, and outcomes data. To maximize the value of biospecimens in our
repository, we will conduct detailed medical chart abstraction for CRC patients and harmonize data from
epidemiological studies. In Aim 4 the Biospecimen Utilization Committee will prioritize access to biospecimens
and their associated data based on the merit of the proposed translational cancer disparities research. Our multi-
institutional committee has developed a specimen utilization plan that aims to maximize the scientific research
that can be conducted using the BPC across SPORE, CEP and DRP projects, as well as outside collaborations
with other SPOREs and beyond. In Aim 5 we will expand our capacity to provide access to state-of-the-art
technologies to meet the needs of all SPORE, CEP, and DRP projects. The BPC, through its integration with
existing Fred Hutch Shared Resources, has access to a large array of cutting-edge technologies and is at the
forefront of developing novel technologies, such as Akoya PhenoCycler (formally CODEX), NanoString GeoMx

all phases, including study design considerations (e.g., common designs and protocols across study sites and
racial and ethnic groups), data collection methods (e.g., assays performed simultaneously), and data analyses
(e.g., accounting for factors that may confound the associations). To serve the SPORE program and ensure
the rigor of research activities, the BBC has two aims. Aim 1 is to provide statistical and bioinformatic support
in the areas of risk prediction, observational studies, survivorship, treatment response, and clinical trials,
utilizing a variety of cutting-edge omics data, such as single cell ATACseq and RNAseq, genome-wide genetic
sequencing, digital spatial single cell profiling, and microbiome profiling. The BBC will collaborate with SPORE
investigators on study design, data quality control, analysis, and interpretation of results, including biological
interpretation of study findings using bioinformatics tools. Additionally, the BBC will partner with all projects as
they prepare manuscripts and present their results to ensure that the data disseminated are unbiased and valid
across racial and ethnic groups. Aim 2 is to monitor ongoing methodological developments and evaluate state-
of-the-art statistical methods and computational tools as they are being developed to enable powerful analyses
of novel data structures arising from SPORE projects. When necessary, the BBC will also adapt existing or
develop new methods and tools to advance SPORE research. The BBC is fully integrated into the four SPORE
projects and the Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs, and has been designed and
structured specifically to support SPORE investigators and their translational cancer disparities research.
Together with the Administrative and Biospecimen and Pathology Cores, the BBC will synergistically interact
with investigators and provide statistical and bioinformatic support to ensure that study designs are unbiased,
data collection methods are consistently applied, and data processing and analyses are systematically
conducted across all racial and ethnic groups. The BBC investigators have extensive track records in
methodological and CRC research including germline genetics, tumor genomics, and translational research.
Building upon this record and established analytic expertise, the BBC will enhance the rigor and quality of all

5. Monitor the progress of funded projects and help advance them to become full SPORE or R type grants.
To achieve these Specific Aims, new ideas will be solicited on an annual basis by broadly advertising the
availability of our pilot funds and by directly engaging with promising investigators. We will encourage early-
career and established investigators to collaborate across disciplines. To ensure a rigorous and balanced
scientific review of DRP proposals, we will convene an expert panel encompassing a broad range of scientific
disciplines and include participation from our Community Advisory Board. Combined with our generous
institutional support, we will award $125,000 of funding to DRP projects annually and anticipate that each year
we will fund 2-4 projects. Funded DRP projects will receive strong infrastructure support, access to
biospecimens, data, and expertise related to novel technologies and statistical analyses through our
Administrative, Biospecimen and Pathology and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Cores as well as training in
cancer disparities research as offered by the Career Enhancement Program. We will provide mentorship to all
DRP investigators to ensure long-term engagement with the TRPCD and its mission. The progress of all DRP
projects will be monitored regularly with respect to achieving their specific aims and milestones using clearly
defined evaluation criteria. We will also track long-term reportable outcomes of each project such as peer-
reviewed manuscripts, oral presentations, and grant funding. During our funded P20 SPORE planning phase we
have gained substantial expertise in conducting a successfully DRP that has been instrumental in supporting
new research areas leading to full SPORE projects as well as investigator-initiated R type applications
demonstrating our ability to develop a successful DRP and the tremendous importance of the DRP as part of a
strong multipronged Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities."
10935395,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP)
Our Translational Research Program in Colorectal Cancer Disparities' (TRPCD) Career Enhancement Program
is an essential component of our SPORE. Its primary purpose is to attract and support new scientists from
different disciplines (clinical, basic science, and population science) to the field of translational cancer disparities
research. This will be accomplished through achieving the following specific aims:
1. Research support: Foster collaborations that engage junior, mid-level, and senior investigators who wish
 to enhance or refocus their careers on translational cancer disparities research by providing research funding
 and complementary scientific expertise to pursue novel disparities research projects.
2. Mentorship and Sponsorship: Using a structured approach, provide all investigators engaged in the CEP
 with appropriate mentors to help advance their pursuit of translational cancer disparities research.
 Additionally, we will identify individuals within each investigator's institution who can serve as sponsors and
 provide guidance and opportunities to help enhance their careers.
3. Leadership development: A critical national need is efforts to diversify the leadership of the nation's NCI-
 designated cancer centers. We will provide leadership development opportunities for CEP participants with
 a particular emphasis on women, underrepresented minorities (such as those prioritized in our TRPCD
 research, Alaska Native, African American, and Hispanic people), and individuals with disabilities.
4. Recruitment and Retention: Through engaging in processes for new investigator/faculty recruitment and
 leveraging strategies for investigator retention in each of our participating institutions, we will support the
 recruitment of new investigators focused on translational cancer disparities research and facilitate retention
 of investigators conducting this type of research.
The CEP will be coordinated between FHCC, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, and Ochsner Health. Recruitment of candidates will be conducted across all sites, and tailored career
enhancement programs will be developed to meet the needs of each awardee. Cornerstones of our program
include identifying and providing multi-disciplinary mentors, assigning sponsors, and providing opportunities for
leadership development as appropriate. Consistent with our SPORE's overarching values, the CEP will actively
seek to support scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. The number of scientists we can support has
been further enhanced through designated institutional funds from FHCC to double the funding level of our CEP."
10934711,"EQUITY AND DISSEMINATION CORE SUMMARY
The purpose of the Equity and Dissemination (E&D) Core is to maximize the impact of the Improving causal
inference in AD projects for prevention research on modifiable risk factors: the Triangulation of
Innovative Methods to End AD (TIME-AD) project on improving health equity and population health. The
E&D Core will accomplish this foremost by continually focusing on health equity while collaborating with
projects and cores throughout the analytic and dissemination stages to produce unbiased, culturally-relevant
scientific findings. This core will seek opportunities for more inclusive data analysis approaches, such as
settings where more representative data might be incorporated or added to enrich the diversity of study
findings, and opportunities for analytics that would extend findings from non-representative samples to more
diverse populations. Once TIME-AD scientists have produced unbiased findings relevant to these
subpopulations, the core will disseminate results to relevant stakeholders who can use and act on the evidence
in an inclusive manner. This includes identifying components of our work that should be shared with different
target audiences, including researchers, the general public, clinical providers and health systems, community
health advocates, media sources, or policymakers. This core responds to a well-recognized need to reduce
AD/ADRD inequities and will ensure that TIME-AD projects findings are relevant to this aim and that they reach
real-world stakeholders in the most impactful form."
10934712,"COGNITION, EXPOSURE, AND COVARIATES DATA CORE SUMMARY
The TIME-AD project will use multiple data sources to enhance understanding of how AD/ADRD risk is affected
by four high priority risk factor categories: alcohol use; depression and anti-depressant medications; prevention
and treatment of hearing and vision impairments; and social isolation. The Cognition, Exposure, and Covariates
(CEC) Data Core is an essential component of TIME-AD and creates critical synergies to make this highly
ambitious project feasible. The CEC will provide analytic data sets to each of the four projects, taking advantage
of shared resources for the intensive data cleaning, wrangling, and data set construction efforts required, bringing
together diverse expertise to guide decisions about how to code AD/ADRD-related outcomes, and minimizing
the need for each research team to revisit decisions about coding outcomes or covariates. Two major
methodologic challenges shared across projects will be tackled within the CEC core. The first is identifying
optimal measures of cognitive outcomes and evaluating tradeoffs between measures grounded in clinical
diagnoses versus measures based on repeated cognitive assessments in a research setting. Within clinical
diagnostic categories, additional nuance is involved in handling dementia etiology (e.g., AD, cerebrovascular)
versus all-cause dementia, given the high preponderance of multiple copathologies and limitations of clinical
measures to differentiate specific pathologies. The second major methodologic challenge is identifying
appropriate covariate sets for time-varying exposures and survival models, to maximize control of confounding,
and address selective survival, while avoiding controlling for mediators. Researchers conducting analyses for
the four projects will consult with the CEC to ensure analytic data sets reflect topical expertise and are
appropriate for each project. The CEC Core team includes experts on each of the data sets, investigators with
expertise in methodologic considerations that will guide data set construction (e.g., for emulated trial designs,
clinical and neuropsychological outcomes), and leaders who will ensure cross-project compatibility and
documentation. The CEC will work in close contact with each of the projects (to ensure the data sets meet the
research needs of each project), the Genetic and Policy Data Core (to incorporate the IV measures into the
project data sets), the Analytics Core (to ensure the data set structures match the needs of the proposed
analyses, e.g., for survival models), and the Equity and Dissemination Core (to ensure that diversity related
issues are maintained to the utmost extent within the data sets and coding decisions such as classification of
racial/ethnic identity are consistent with an anti-racist and equity-promoting framework)."
10942990,"Project Summary/Abstract
How brain circuits are modulated by sensory signals from internal organs (viscera) during ethologically relevant
behaviors is a fundamental, yet largely unexplored question in neuroscience. Achieving a comprehensive
understanding of viscerosensory integration in the brain of unanesthetized animals has been challenging given
that neural activity measurements in the vagus nerve, the main viscerosensory input to the brain, require
invasive procedures in rodents. This project will address this challenge by using the zebrafish larva. Its
suitability for organism-wide neural activity measurement and genetic manipulation, as well as its well-
characterized behaviors, all make it an ideal system for a comprehensive systems-level investigation of
viscerosensory integration in the brain during naturalistic behaviors. In the R34 phase of the grant, this project
will focus on (1) probing visceral response dynamics like heart rate, gill ventilation, and gut motility in response
to environmental challenges; and (2) determining the viscerosensory inputs to the brain by studying the
encoding properties of vagal sensory neurons. Accomplishing Aims 1 and 2 would set the stage for
investigating the neural circuits that integrate viscerosensory information in different brain regions and their
role in behavior and decision-making.
Aim 1: Determine internal organ dynamics in response to environmental changes.
Aim 1 of the project will measure the changes in heart rate, gill ventilation, and gut motility in addition to
tracking behavioral variables like tail angle and eye position during responses to visual threat, oxygen
fluctuations, or temperature fluctuations. We will use machine learning techniques to identify discrete ‘visceral
states’ from measured internal organ dynamics. Then behavioral and visceral states will be merged using
multidimensional embedding techniques to identify discrete ‘organismal states’ and the transitions between
them.
Aim 2: Probe the encoding properties of vagal sensory neurons
Aim 2 will measure neural activity in the right and left vagal sensory ganglia of behaving fish while also
tracking the internal organ parameters described in aim 1. These datasets will be summarized using encoding
models to describe the visceral information represented in each cell of each vagal ganglion."
10943067,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Vaccines composed solely of antigens are often poorly immunogenic; increasing intensity and length of
the induced immune response is required to achieve desirable vaccine efficacy. Adjuvants (adjuvare, to help)
are biomolecules used for >100 years to enhance human immune responses to vaccine antigens. Vaccines
containing adjuvants are spectacularly successful, with billions of doses administered to save millions of lives
each year. Despite this success, there is only a limited set of FDA-approved adjuvants (e.g., aluminum salts, oil-
in-water emulsions, CpG oligonucleotides, and an extract [aka QS-21] from the Chilean soapbark tree [Quillaja
saponaria]) owing to the intrinsic toxicity of new adjuvant candidates, difficulty to source and produce them, and
their poor ability to induce long-term immunogenicity. Ongoing efforts to tailor adjuvant bioactivity are limited
because their structure-activity relationships and mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Herein, we
propose to address this challenge by engineering adjuvants through iterative diversification of their molecular
structures (synthetic biology) and deduction of their molecular-level immunogenic mechanisms (systems-level
immunology), an approach that will enable the rapid discovery of improved adjuvants. Recently, we engineered
yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce QS-21 from simple sugars by upregulating native yeast pathways
and heterologously expressing 38 proteins from six other organisms. We also have extensive experience in
profiling (in vitro and in vivo) immunogenicity (innate and adaptive) of small molecules (e.g., adjuvants)
associated with both bacterial and viral antigens. Together, we are uniquely positioned to redesign the microbial
biosynthetic pathway for QS-21 to access its scalable production as well as that of its natural (i.e., QS-7) and
new-to-nature (i.e., a “core pharmacophore”) analogs (Specific Aim 1). QS-21, QS-7, and a “core
pharmacophore” will be starting points for a rapid pipeline that iteratively studies their mechanisms of action
through systems- and molecular-level immunology studies (Specific Aim 2) and diversifies their molecular
structures using combinatorial synthetic biology approaches (Specific Aim 3). Ultimately, this interdisciplinary
and innovative approach will establish a framework to discover the structure-activity relationships that govern
adjuvant immunogenicity and apply this knowledge to design and deploy best-in-class adjuvants that transform
the prevention and treatment of disease."
10943068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alpha Protein Kinase 3 (ALPK3) is an atypical protein kinase belonging to the alpha (α)-kinase family. Loss-of-
function mutations in ALPK3 result in human cardiomyopathy. Currently, no specific treatments are available
for patients diagnosed with ALPK3 cardiomyopathy. To understand the in vivo role of ALPK3, we generated
Alpk3 global knockout (gKO) mice, which displayed a sequential progression from early-onset dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) to late-stage atypical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). These mice accurately
mimic the pathological development of cardiac abnormalities observed in humans carrying loss-of-function
ALPK3 variants. In addition, we generated Alpk3 constitutive (cKO) and inducible (icKO) cardiac-specific
knockout mouse models. Our data revealed that, like Alpk3 gKO mice, Alpk3 cKO mice develop early-onset
DCM leading to premature lethality, suggesting that the primary cause of the cardiac phenotypes observed in
Alpk3 gKO mice is due to loss of ALPK3 in cardiomyocytes. We also observed that adult Alpk3 icKO mice
develop DCM and heart failure. Gene therapies offer an attractive approach for addressing a wide range of
human diseases by directly targeting the underlying molecular causes. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based
gene therapies have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in gene therapies for several cardiovascular diseases.
We aimed to utilize a robust muscle-tropic adeno-associated virus (MyoAAV) vector to deliver Alpk3 cDNA into
the myocardium of Alpk3 gKO mice, with the goal of treating ALPK3 cardiomyopathy. However, the coding
sequence of the wild-type Alpk3 cDNA, encodes 1,608 amino acids (AAs), spanning 4,824 base pairs, which
exceeds the 4.7 kb AAV packaging limit. Consequently, we developed a compact yet functional Alpk3 variant,
named mini-ALPK3, designed for efficient AAV packaging and potential ALPK3 cardiomyopathy treatment. To
validate the functionality of the mini-ALPK3 gene, we generated a mouse model in which mini-ALPK3 replaced
the normal Alpk3 allele. Remarkably, mice homozygous for mini-ALPK3 exhibit normal cardiac function
throughout adulthood, suggesting that mini-ALPK3 can fully compensate for the full-length ALPK3 in terms of
heart functionality. Based on these compelling findings, we propose the hypothesis that mini-ALPK3 gene
replacement therapy, delivered via MyoAAV vector, can effectively rescue cardiac phenotypes and premature
mortality in Alpk3 knockout mice. Accordingly, our specific aims are: 1. To ascertain whether mini-ALPK3 gene
replacement in Alpk3 knockout mice, administered on postnatal day 1 prior to the manifestation of cardiac
abnormalities, can prevent cardiac phenotypes and rescue premature mortality; 2. To evaluate whether mini-
ALPK3 gene replacement in Alpk3 knockout mice, administered at one month of age when DCM phenotypes
become evident, can reverse DCM phenotypes; and 3. To investigate the capability of mini-ALPK3 gene
replacement in Alpk3 knockout mice, administered at two months of age when atypical HCM phenotypes are
evident, to effectively reverse late-stage HCM phenotypes."

Impulsivity refers to the propensity toward rapid action without forethought of the consequences and
devaluing rewards that are delayed in time in favor of immediate gratification. Food impulsivity is associated
with obesity and binge-eating disorder and can counter efforts to make healthy food choices. Regions of the
brain that regulate food impulsive behaviors, such as the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
undergo neuroplasticity during adolescence and emerging evidence indicates that hippocampal-dependent
memory is vulnerable to the deleterious impact adolescent consumption of “Western diets” (WD) high in
saturated fat and added sugars. Furthermore, hippocampal dysfunction associated with adolescent WD
consumption is not easily reversible by switching to a healthy diet during adulthood. We propose that
adolescent consumption of a WD impairs hippocampal development leading to increased impulsive eating
behavior during adulthood. Our unpublished preliminary data are consistent with this hypothesis and show
that female rodents fed a WD during adolescence have increased impulsive actions when responding for a
palatable food reinforcer during adulthood. Proposed work will extend this model to males and will also
determine whether females and males on a WD during adolescence show a propensity to select smaller and
more immediate food rewards over waiting for a larger payoff (delay discounting test of impulsive choice). Our
additional preliminary in vivo calcium imaging data reveal differential calcium dynamics in the ventral CA1
hippocampus (vCA1) prior to impulsive vs. non-impulsive food-directed action, with analogous effects
observed in the nucleus accumbens shell (ACBsh). Building off these findings, we propose to determine how
specific hippocampal circuits (vCA1->mPFC and vCA1->ACBsh) known for their role in modulating reward
behaviors, inhibitory control, and impulsivity, are impacted by an adolescent WD consumption in rats. To
determine whether behavioral intervention can reverse the long-lasting increased food impulsivity associated
with adolescent WD, we will also investigate whether aerobic exercise, which is known to attenuate WD-
induced hippocampal-dependent memory impairments, can attenuate adolescent WD-induced food impulsive
actions and choices. Further, we have previously shown that the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) acts on a vCA1->mPFC pathway to reduce food impulsive behavior. Thus, here we propose to
determine whether clinically relevant FDA-approved GLP-1 analogue treatment reverses or attenuates
adolescent WD-induced food impulsive behaviors. This proposal is sufficiently powered to determine sex
differences for all experiments, and results from these studies will provide a critical contribution to obesity
developmental neuroscience research and advance our understanding of how diet impacts eating behaviors."
10942537,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Withdrawal is a major obstacle in overcoming opioid dependence and addiction. Identifying the neural circuits
involved and how opioids modulate the activity of those circuits is essential for developing new therapeutic
approaches to prevent or treat opioid use disorder. The medial habenula (MHb) projects primarily to the
interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and has long been known to express high levels of the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR).
Activity in this circuit has been associated with expression of fear and anxiety; and repeatedly implicated in
mediating aversive qualities of nicotine and nicotine dependence. Emerging evidence also supports a role for
MHb projections to IPN in the somatic and affective symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Despite this, there is
remarkably little information on what cell types in both MHb and IPN express MOR, how MOR signaling
influences this circuit, and whether chronic MOR signaling induces physiological changes in this circuit that
contribute to withdrawal. In this proposal we propose experiments to inform each of these questions using a
combination of molecular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to investigate MOR-expressing neurons in
both MHb and IPN of mice. Based on prior literature and preliminary data we posit an important role for excitatory
neurons in lateral MHb and inhibitory neurons in rostral IPN in mediating aversive qualities of opioid dependence
that contribute to withdrawal and relapse."

 The biomedical workforce fails to represent the diverse makeup of the US population. Numerous
groups, including Indigenous and those from rural backgrounds, are significantly underrepresented in this
workforce that addresses health concerns of local and global significance. To support Indigenous students
and others from historically underrepresented backgrounds, our Research Advising and Mentoring
Professionals for Underrepresented Peoples (RAMP UP) program will build on successes, experiences,
and lessons learned from UAF's Biomedical Learning and Student Training (BLaST), our NIH-funded
Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BuILD) program. Specifically, RAMP UP will develop,
deliver, and evaluate a holistic and customized mentor training program that focuses on supporting
faculty, graduate students, and research staff located at institutions that serve underrepresented
undergraduate students in biomedical research. This intensive, year-long training program, augmented
with continuing support from RAMP UP staff and network resources, will administer a supportive and
culturally appropriate approach to create a network of mentors who possess the knowledge and skills they
require to provide academic advising, research mentoring, and psychosocial support to the students they
serve; especially those students who are typically underrepresented in the biomedical fields."
10951023,"Uterine fibroids affect approximately 30% of all women in the United States or about 45 million
individuals. The clinical diagnosis of uterine fibroids is two to three times more common in African-
American women than in Caucasian women. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a nonsurgical
therapy that shrinks fibroids by blocking arterial blood flow to the lesions. Prior to the UAE
procedure almost all patients receive a contrast-enhanced MRI, which is currently considered the
reference imaging method. After the UAE, the current strategy is to request a contrast-enhanced
MRI to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. However, an MRI is not always available and
remains very expensive. Ultrasound imaging offers a low cost, non-invasive, and readily available
approach, which can characterize both structural and functional features of tumor vascularity from
its earliest stages. Moreover, microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) not only
enhance the backscattered signals, but at higher acoustic pressures they also act as nonlinear
oscillators producing significant energy components in the received echo signals. These nonlinear
bubble echoes can be separated from tissue echoes and used to create contrast specific
ultrasound imaging modalities (e.g., harmonic imaging; HI). HI preferentially enhances and
displays contrast signals rather than surrounding tissue echoes by transmitting at the fundamental
transducer frequency (f0) and receiving at the second harmonic (2f0). HI is commercially available
on most state-of-the-art ultrasound scanners. Our group developed the fundamental concept of
contrast-enhanced subharmonic-aided pressure estimation (SHAPE). This approach relies on
using the inverse linear relationship between subharmonic signals from UCA and the ambient
pressures. Therefore, we believe that development of SHAPE as an accurate noninvasive
technique for measurement of ambient pressure can be translated for the evaluation of uterine
fibroids pressures in order to establish parameters for dynamic evaluation. Thus, this study goals
are to determine the patterns of uterine fibroid vascularity pre and post UAE using CEUS resulting
in an alternative to gadolinium-enhanced MRI that is less expensive, has less contra-indications
and side effects, is real time, and noninvasive helping physicians to evaluate the result of UAE
procedures. Also, this study will evaluate uterine fibroid pressures using SHAPE, comparing the
results with normal myometrium tissue in order to determine its characteristics and tissue
differences, which we believe will lead to the development of a new biomarker for the diagnosis
and treatment of uterine fibroids."

Malaria is a devastating disease that impacts millions of people on an annual basis. While several species
of Plasmodium parasites cause malaria in humans, P. falciparum is responsible for the highest rates of
complications and mortality. Malaria elimination efforts are continually challenged by the emergence and
spread of resistant P. falciparum strains to frontline chemotherapies. New treatments targeting alternative
molecular targets in the parasite are therefore urgently needed. An ideal antimalarial drug should exhibit
prophylactic, curative and transmission blocking properties. However, few clinically approved drugs fit
this profile due to a two-fold problem: 1) many genes that are essential in mosquito or liver stage parasites
are dispensable in symptomatic blood stages, making it hard to identify a drug target that is relevant
throughout the parasite life cycle; 2) the field has historically suffered from a dearth of robust genetic tools
to investigate basic parasite biology, a prerequisite for uncovering novel therapeutic approaches. In
response to these challenges, we propose using new and improved genetic methods to expand the
druggable parasite proteome across all stages of infection. We will focus our efforts on the parasite
mitochondrion, a promising source of drug targets since it is essential in all parasite life stages and is
highly divergent from its human counterpart. This organelle’s potential as an antimalarial target has
already been validated by atovaquone, the only mitochondrial inhibitor in clinical use. Notably,
atovaquone belongs to the very small group of drugs that are active against both symptomatic and
transmission stages of infection. The mitochondrion contains nearly 10% of the total parasite proteome,
the majority of which has no known function. Identifying essential processes within the mitochondrion can
pave the way for the development of new drugs that not only prevent or treat malaria but also block
transmission."

This proposal’s objective is to determine whether genetic mutations that alter the transcriptional activity of the
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Achaete-scute complex 1 (ASCL1) contribute to the etiology
of organ-specific autoimmunity in humans. Transcription factor mutations that result in the misregulation of
gene expression are particularly potent drivers of human disease. Studies of individuals and families with
suspected monogenic forms of autoimmunity provide a unique opportunity to understand novel pathways in
human immune biology and have revealed mutations in thymic transcription factors as potent drivers of
autoimmunity. For example, mutations in the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) gene cause a spectrum of organ-
specific autoimmune conditions such as hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease (adrenals)
and type 1 diabetes (pancreas). AIRE is a transcriptional activator that drives the expression of tissue-
restricted self-antigens (TSAs) in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to enable the deletion of
autoreactive T cells, a process termed “central tolerance”. While AIRE is critical for central tolerance, the
severity and spectrum of organ-specific clinical disease among AIRE patients, including siblings with identical
AIRE mutations, underscores the existence of disease-modulating variables, including perhaps organ-specific
disease-promoting and/or ameliorating genetic elements that modulate AIRE expression, activity or function.
ASCL1, an established bHLH transcription factor that orchestrates the proliferation, specification and
differentiation of neural progenitors, was recently reported to be expressed in three human medullary thymic
cell subpopulations: two known to be critical for central tolerance, 1) AIRE+ mTECs and 2) their developmental
precursors (AIRE- mTECs); and 3) a novel subpopulation of thymic neuroendocrine cells. The role of ASCL1 in
immune biology and autoimmune disease is completely unknown. We have also identified one individual and
two siblings in our UCSF patient registry with suspected monogenic autoimmunity and ASCL1 mutations. The
individuals tested negative for known genetic causes of autoimmunity and have rare/predicted deleterious
ASCL1 mutations that are adjacently positioned within the transactivation domain of the protein. The novel
discovery of ASCL1 expression in the thymus coupled with the identification of suspected ASCL1 monogenic
autoimmune patients leads to the general hypothesis for this project. We hypothesize that ASCL1 mutations
that alter its transcriptional activity disrupt the development, function, and/or microenvironment of AIRE+
mTECs, resulting in autoimmunity."
10949256,"ABSTRACT. The availability of large data sets from research studies via data depositories is believed to be
critical to tackle key questions about “complex diseases” like psychiatric disorders (Farber, 2017; Patel et al.,
2022). Consequently, NIMH-supported investigations have been recently mandated to archive all their data.
Notably, NIMH is currently funding the archiving of three consecutive grants we completed years ago, the data
from which would otherwise be lost to the research community. These projects (plus a recently completed one)
together constitute a longitudinal data base on the course and outcome of young patients with research
diagnoses of depressive disorders that onset in the juvenile years (data on biological siblings and controls are
also available). Juvenile-onset depression (JOD) is a particularly malignant depression phenotype, with a
worse overall clinical course and greater functional impairment than later onset depression, and is still not fully
understood. Our aim is to develop prototype machine learning (ML) algorithms (which can be customized as
needed) to facilitate the analyses of the longitudinal data being archived in the National Data Archive (NDA).
The data reflect repeated assessments from ages 7- to 14-years (at the start of study 1) to ages between the
late 20’s to early 30’s (end of study 4) on multiple domains of functioning and can yield actionable information
about which risk and protective variables/domains best predict clinical and functional outcomes of JOD (e.g.,
depression recurrence, suicidal behavior, emotional competence). Because commonly used modelling
approaches (which typically test a priori defined pathways) cannot accommodate the complexity of our data
and key questions about JOD, we demonstrate the novel application of machine learning (ML) approaches.
We propose that questions about JOD outcomes exemplify two scenarios. Scenario (A) includes questions
about well-established outcomes (e.g., depression recurrence) and a handful of well-known predictors but
meager information about the interrelationships among the predictors, particularly along the course of
development. Scenario (B) reflects questions about less established outcomes (successful emotion regulation)
the predictors of which are not well known, or have only equivocal support. We will demonstrate how to
accommodate such scenarios through two ML approaches: probabilistic graphical modeling and ensemble
learning methods. We apply these modeling approaches within a developmental framework in a unique way to
leverage the wealth of longitudinal information on multiple domains of functioning. To enable researchers to
fully utilize the NDA-based (as well as similar) data, we will release the Python code packages we develop and
the code for downloading and properly organizing the related data. Our approach may shift current analytic
practices in developmental psychopathology research toward models that can optimize the use of such data,
result in more comprehensive accounts of the course of psychopathology across the life span, and thereby
inform efforts to prevent, or mitigate, negative outcomes of JOD."
10950486,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Thousands of students yearly are drawn to biomedical engineering (BME) by the prospect of a career linking
medicine and engineering. Unfortunately, students from historically underrepresented racial/ethnic minority
(HU; e.g., Hispanic\Latinx) groups do not advance or integrate into the BME professional community at rates
comparable to their majority peers. National statistics indicate that Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic
racial/ethnic minority groups accounted for only 12% of bioengineering and BME graduates in 2021. Data
collected at Texas A&M University, a Hispanic Serving Institution and ranked 5th nationally in bachelor’s
degrees awarded in BME in 2022, show that students from HU groups (on average ~25% of BME majors, up
to 33% in recent years) lag behind their peers from historically overrepresented (HO) groups on measures of
academic success (e.g., time to graduation). Social Network and Mentoring Co-Regulation theories, and
preliminary data suggest these disparities may be due to HU students holding less privileged positions within
their peer network, having less access to mentors, and therefore having less access to social capital (i.e.,
information, support, and resources) and support for self-regulated learning (SRL; e.g., help-seeking). The
long-term overall objectives of this work are to develop a generalizable model of how social networks facilitate
students’ biomedical research career success and to diversify the BME research workforce. This study will (1)
examine the impact of generalizable “Creating Birds of a Feather” (CBoaF) peer and mentor network
interventions designed to promote diverse students’ “Hallmarks of Success” outcomes (e.g., well-being, GPA,
degree conferral), and (2) assess the contributions of students’ SRL and social capital. The central hypothesis
is that being well-connected within peer and mentor networks will promote access to social capital and support
for effective SRL, which will promote success in BME. The project will implement a longitudinal, randomized
experiment via a professional development workshop across three cohorts (2024-2026) of first-year BME
majors to ensure a large and diverse sample of emerging biomedical engineers (N=360) from HU (n=108) and
HO (n=252) groups. Aim 1 will test a peer network intervention by randomly assigning students to one of three
workshop groups: (1A) CBoaF enhanced inclusive activity workshop at a Mixed Low/High table (containing
students with low and high connections with peers), (1B) CBoaF enhanced inclusive activity workshop at a
Same-level table (i.e., low-only, high-only), or (1C) Alternative workshop control group without CBoaF
activities. Aim 2 will test a mentor network intervention by randomly assigning students to one of two mentor
introduction groups: (2A) Introduction + CBoaF similarities highlighted or (2B) Introduction only. Exploratory
Aim 3 will assess the degree to which intervention effects are stronger for students from HU groups compared
to their HO group peers. This study will show how and why helping diverse BME students form stronger social
networks can promote their well-being and BME career success."

Research: The proposed research is entitled: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Monitoring of Polymicrobial Infections
in Diabetic Wounds. Diabetic wounds are prone to bacterial infections, which delay wound healing and cause
severe outcomes such as amputation and sepsis. To combat wound infections, our ongoing study pinpoints
Glutamate 1-Semialdehyde (GSA), a previously underexplored bacterial metabolite in the porphyrin biosynthesis
pathway. GSA can selectively induce porphyrin accumulation in bacteria but not in host cells, as the pathway is
notably absent in mammals. Porphyrin accumulation causes bacteria to fluoresce and become susceptible to
blue or red light-based killing, offering a novel method to diagnose, monitor, and treat diabetic wound infections
conveniently, thereby preventing catastrophic outcomes. Our substantial preliminary data have demonstrated
the fluorescence imaging and killing potential of GSA-phototherapy on common wound-infecting bacteria. In this
study, we will investigate the detection thresholds, biosafety, and killing efficacy of this novel modality using
diabetic mice. The translational potential of GSA-phototherapy will also be tested on diabetic mini-pigs. Our
proposal offers a multifaceted solution for the timely diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and non-antibiotic treatment
of bacterial infections, addressing the critical needs in the management of chronic diabetic wounds.
Mentors/Career Plan: My immediate goal is to acquire specialized training in diabetes and wound healing. To
accomplish this, I have enlisted Prof. Aristidis Veves, an authority on diabetic foot ulcers, as my co-mentor. We
have identified key didactic courses and symposiums to supplement my training, and he also offers me
opportunities for clinical shadowing and hands-on training with diabetic mini-pigs. In the middle of the K01 award,
I aim to draft and apply for an R01 grant designed to produce a convenient GSA dressing and a phone-based
detection device that empower diabetic patients to manage their wound infections proactively and easily at home.
Achieving this objective necessitates a deep understanding of photonics, fluorescence imaging, device design,
and wound dressing technologies. Courses and conferences are proposed accordingly. My ultimate ambition is
to evolve into an independent investigator, focusing on pioneering bacterial-specific photomedicine for combating
diabetic wound infections and promoting wound healing. Prof. Mei X. Wu, my primary mentor, has made a
detailed training plan to strengthen my publication record, build my academic networking, hone my grant writing,
leadership, and transferable skills. She is deeply engaged and ensures my adherence to the timeline and,
ultimately, my pathway to independence. Environment: My research will be primarily conducted in the Wellman
Center for Photomedicine, in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). I will
also collaborate with Prof. Veves of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). I have access to all
essential resources at these locations and facilities. The diverse professional development resources available
at MGH and HMS ensure my ability to pursue the planned study and career development goals effectively."

The goals of this project are to 1) test the hypothesis that Pax8 expression controls sensitivity to ischemic kidney injury in the mature proximal tubule by promoting transcription of Hnf4a targets and 2) facilitate a path to an independent research program for the PI. Ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical syndrome associated with significant mortality, yet no treatments are in routine clinical use. Ischemic AKI most strongly affects the proximal tubule, in part due to the unique metabolic pathways used by this nephron segment. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that establish this unique metabolic profile could lead to a better understanding of ischemic AKI pathogenesis and new therapeutic targets. As part of the associated K08 award, we discovered that proximal-tubule-selective depletion of the transcription factor Pax8 resulted in a population of proximal tubule cells resistant to kidney injury. Analysis of the transcriptome of these cells revealed alterations in genes associated with proximal tubule metabolism. However, the genes affected by Pax8 depletion were not preferentially associated with sites of Pax8 chromatin binding. Analysis of other transcription factors associated with genes affected by Pax8 depletion revealed a central role of Hnf4a. These observations suggest the hypothesis that Pax8 expression controls sensitivity to ischemic kidney injury in the proximal tubule by promoting transcription of Hnf4a targets. This project will investigate this hypothesis by determining the role of Pax8 in the chromatin localization of Hnf4a and by identifying metabolic pathways coregulated by Pax8 and HNF4a in response to ischemic injury in vivo. The targets identified in each of these aims will form the basis for independent research support studying the molecular and genetic determinants of ischemic AKI risk."
10947728,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This proposal addresses the lack of patient-derived model systems in hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast
cancer, and also the lack of ethnically representative models of breast cancer. The majority of newly diagnosed
breast cancers (>70%) are HR+, and two-thirds of the estimated 42,690 breast cancer deaths will be from HR+
breast cancer. Recurrent HR+ breast cancer has been difficult to study given the prolonged clinical course and
the lack of appropriate patient-derived model systems. These models have been difficult to derive and grow in
the past, with low take-rate (~10-20%), and the models losing their HR expression over time. In addition, tumor
extrinsic factors such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that significantly impact tumor biology and therapy
responses, are rarely incorporated in studies or models of HR+ disease.
 Therefore, to address this gap, we set out to develop more representative models of recurrent and
relapsed HR+ breast cancers, and to incorporate elements of the tumor microenvironment into these models.
To achieve this, we have developed a method for deriving HR+ patient-derived model systems consisting of
both, primary patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) isolated from relapsed and metastatic HR+ tumors, and
matching primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with high take rate (~50%). These models also better
represent the patients’ ethnic and racial diversity, as ~35% of our models are from underrepresented ethnicities
(e.g., African-American, Hispanic). Using these innovative tools, we have already identified SUCNR1 as a driver
of treatment resistance in HR+ breast cancer. These data led us to our hypothesis that targeting SUCNR1, will
reverse treatment resistance observed in metastatic HR+ breast cancers, and that we can use our unique PDO
models as a pre-clinical testing platform of these novel treatment strategies.
 We propose two specific aims: Aim 1 is a more technology driven per the RFA for this R21 and will
expand the number of available metastatic and relapsed HR+ patient-derived models isolated from ethnically
diverse patient populations. In Aim 2 we will Investigate the therapeutic targeting of SUCNR1 in recurrent HR+
breast cancer using our PDO models.
 Our proposal is significant because it addresses multiple fundamental challenges in breast cancer
treatment and management, including lack of patient-derived models for HR+ breast cancer, lack of tumor
models from diverse racial backgrounds, and contribution of CAFs to resistance. Most importantly, we intend to
make these models and tools available to the whole field, therefore the impact of this research is well beyond
our proposed research."

The proposed R36 dissertation project will advance scientific understanding of the criminal legal system’s (CLS) influence on opioid use disorder (OUD) recovery. CLS involvement is common among those with OUD, and for many, the CLS facilitates access to recovery services, either through provision of treatment or connection to care upon release. There is an inherent role contradiction present here; since the CLS also is tasked with maintaining public safety, there could be unintended consequences on a person's recovery. The proposed mixed-methods study aligns with the NIDA Services Research Branch priority to better understand the impact of CLS involvement on substance use, service engagement, and recovery. This project uses a socioecological framework to enhance understanding of the community, interpersonal, and individual-level influence of CLS involvement on OUD treatment and recovery. Aim 1 examines the impact of the CLS on OUD treatment and recovery language among people residing and working in communities highly impacted by the opioid epidemic (community). This is achieved via qualitative thematic analysis of Photovoice group transcripts (N = 45 participants) from the Kentucky HEALing Communities Study Photovoice protocol. Aim 2 analyzes the effect of social network factors on prison substance use disorder (SUD) treatment completion (interpersonal). Aim 2 is achieved by conducting secondary data analysis using data from the Geographic variation in Addiction Treatment Environment (GATE) study, a longitudinal cohort study examining medication use for OUD treatment and other recovery outcomes of individuals who participated in SUD treatment programming while incarcerated (N = 320). Aim 2 uses logistic regression to analyze whether internalized stigma mediates the relationship between social network factors and SUD treatment completion. Finally, Aim 3 uses GATE study data to evaluate CLS-related predictors of participation in mutual aid support groups (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous) post-release (individual). Negative binomial logistic regression analyzes the effect of CLS-related factors on the number of mutual support groups attended in the 6-months after release. Results of this project highlight the urgent need to address the multi-level impact of the CLS on OUD recovery to combat the opioid epidemic among people involved with the CLS. The R36 aims will serve as the applicant’s dissertation. OUD recovery is not merely an individual process, so barriers to recovery must be addressed at multiple levels of CLS influence to best effect change and have a sustained public health impact. The R36 dissertation project outlined in this application launches the Principal Investigator on a path towards becoming an NIH independent investigator."
10951234,"Project Summary
Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, projected to affect more than eight million Americans
by 2030. Frequent symptoms, hospitalizations, and hospital readmissions are common among this population,
causing significant suffering, particularly near the end of life. Conversations about prognosis, the benefits and
harms of invasive treatments, and patient care goals and preferences are essential to promote goal-
concordant care among this population. Yet, these conversations occur infrequently. To address these critical
needs, the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Failure Society of
America recommend palliative care as a Class I (strong) recommendation “for all patients with heart failure to
improve quality of life and relieve suffering.” However, fewer than 20% of this population receive Specialist
Palliative Care. Patient prognosis is a key criterion for referral to palliative care among this population. Our
team developed and validated an automated electronic health record-based 1-year mortality risk model for
people hospitalized with heart failure and embedded the model into an interruptive alert to facilitate clinician
decision-making. While the alert was highly accurate, acceptable, and feasible among clinicians, it did not
result in a significant increase in referrals to Specialist Palliative Care in a subsequent clinical trial. Interruptive
alerts deliver the right information but often at the wrong time, resulting in clinician overrides and task
abandonment. Non-interruptive clinical decision support (CDS), such as targeted modal alerts and passive
designs, provides innovative alternatives to interruptive alerts. However, their effectiveness hinges on careful
user-centered design and the development of strategies for implementation. Thus, our overall objective is to
design and pilot test the Promoting Palliative Care for People with Heart Failure (P3HF) CDS, a tool that
incorporates our 1-year mortality alert with evidence-based CDS design, and critically, pairs the CDS with
strategies for implementation. To accomplish our objectives, we will design the P3HF CDS and develop an
accompanying implementation package using a theory-informed process involving interviews, iterative design,
and focus-group-led evaluation with healthcare provider stakeholders (Aim 1). Next, we will conduct a
randomized real-world pilot trial across two hospitals to evaluate the usability, acceptability, appropriateness,
and feasibility of the P3HF CDS and implementation package. We will also examine the intervention's
preliminary efficacy on clinician behavior change (i.e., referral to Specialist Palliative Care, primary outcome)
and patient outcomes (i.e., Advance Care Plan documentation, hospice enrollment, hospital length of stay, 30-
day hospital readmission, exploratory secondary outcomes; Aim 2). This study will provide essential data
necessary and sufficient to inform a subsequent multi-site hybrid efficacy-effectiveness clinical trial of the P3HF
CDS and implementation package. If successful, this project will result in an evidence-based, generalizable
intervention that could greatly improve care delivery and quality of life for people with heart failure."
10948591,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant components of the tumor microenvironment in the skin of
early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) patients. Evidence suggests CAFs promote the progression of early-stage
MF to late-stage MF by suppressing the tumor surveillance function of the immune system. Currently, little is
known about the CAFs responsible for immune evasion and disease progression in MF or how this differs by
patient demographics or stage of disease. As CAFs are heterogeneous cells, investigating CAFs requires novel
molecular techniques that account for the diversity of cell populations and can determine the location of critical
subtypes. The Research Training Plan will use the novel molecular techniques of single-cell RNA sequencing
(AIM 1) and spatial RNA transcriptomics (AIM 2) to uncover the subtypes and location of CAFs responsible for
immune evasion and MF progression from a diverse patient population. In Aim 1, Dr. Johnson will work with
mentor Dr. Winston Timp and advisor Dr. Ron Sweren to obtain patient samples, dissociate whole skin tissue,
and perform single-cell RNA sequencing on patients from diverse stages and demographics in the K99 phase.
Dr. Johnson will train with advisors, Drs. Elana Fertig and Stephanie Hicks to develop computational analysis
and apply statistical models to identify subtypes of CAFs based on gene expression. Advisor Dr. Jaroslaw
Jedrych will provide guidance with immunohistochemistry verification of gene biomarkers. The R00 phase will
include the analysis to identify biomarkers relevant to MF disease diagnosis and prognosis in this diverse patient
population. In Aim 2, Dr. Johnson will work with mentor Dr. Winston Timp and collaborator Dr. Elana Fertig to
execute spatial RNA sequencing techniques and acquire computational analysis to integrate single-cell RNA
sequencing data with spatial RNA sequencing data to locate the subtypes of CAFs identified in AIM 1 in the K99
period. The R00 period will further explore all cells within the tumor microenvironment to uncover candidate
cytokines and receptors responsible for crosstalk pathways between the MF tumor cells and the CAF subtypes
of interest. Dr. Johnson has had some prior training in single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis and expertise in
skin biology. The Career Development Plan is tailored to enable Dr. Johnson to develop computational analytical
skills and refine her statistical analysis of single-cell and spatial data while gaining valuable background skills
through coursework. Mentor Dr. Winston Timp is a leading expert in sequencing and genomics. Advisors Dr.
Stephanie Hicks, an expert in single-cell statistical analysis, and Dr. Elana Fertig, an innovator in computational
analysis of integrative transcriptomics, offer complementary expertise. The JHU Department of Dermatology and
Biomedical Engineering environment is an outstanding collaborative setting with excellent core facilities and
biorepositories infrastructure. In summary, the strong mentoring environment and training plan are anticipated to
prepare Dr. Johnson to launch her independent career. The proposed studies will offer mechanistic insights into
the pathogenesis of MF progression and immune evasion in a diverse patient population."
10950074,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In all animals with internal fertilization, hundreds of seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are transferred to females
during mating. These SFPs have canonically been primarily thought of as a set of male proteins that advance
male interests during post-mating processes, including by manipulatively influencing female behavior and
reproductive investment. From this perspective, SFPs are thought to be an important substrate of interlocus
sexual conflict against which females must continually evolve defensive countermeasures, which has been
hypothesized to explain observations that SFPs evolve rapidly. Using single-nucleus RNAseq of the Drosophila
melanogaster female reproductive tract (uterus, oviduct, glands, and sperm storage organs), I discovered that
females express >40% of the 292 known D. melanogaster SFPs. Moreover, multiple female reproductive cell
types specialize in producing SFPs prior to mating. For example, in a cell type in the seminal receptacle, SFP
genes comprise 30% of mRNAs in the average sequenced nucleus (up to 65% of mRNAs in some sequenced
nuclei). This result demands a re-evaluation of SFP biology that integrates the function and possible selection
on the female-contributed protein fraction, which I take on in this proposal by asking: 1) What are the functions
of female-expressed SFPs, i.e. shared reproductive secreted proteins? Do the female- and male-contributed
protein fractions have the same function? And 2) How do shared secreted reproductive proteins evolve? Do
the sex-shared secreted proteins exhibit different evolutionary modalities than the sex-limited SFPs? Do
evolutionary and functional patterns in these genes better support a model of cooperation or sexual
antagonism? Importantly, for the sex-shared proteins, any potential sexual conflict would have to be intra-locus
conflict, with implications for the predicted duration and outcome of the conflict. I address these knowledge
gaps using cutting-edge genome engineering methods, specifically gene knock-out and scarless CRISPR
insertion of transgenic nanobody-epitope tagged proteins, to allow both immunofluorescent visualization and
functional characterization. A second set of experiments uses comparative genomics and transcriptomics in a
phylogenetic framework to determine the history of the proteins, the persistence of their expression by each
sex, their evolutionary rate, and the evidence for either directional or stabilizing selection on the protein
sequences. Because the cell types in D. melanogaster females that specialize in SFP production belong to the
sperm storage organs, the proposed work will additionally test whether convergently evolved gains of sperm
storage in a third female organ, observed among select non-melanogaster Drosophila species, are associated
with gains of SFP expression in additional cell types. In total, the proposed work will provide a missing
perspective on a famous set of genes in a premier genetic model organism. Simultaneously, the proposal
provides critical training opportunities in future-oriented methodologies, toward achieving career independence."

research. Because postdoctoral training typically focuses on research, future educators face the challenge of
developing both the teaching skills and the research portfolio necessary to be competitive for faculty positions.
As an urban research-intensive institution with a medical school, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is
uniquely positioned to provide this training. The VCU IRACDA program has collaborated with Virginia State

prepare postdoctoral fellows for faculty positions through career development in both cutting edge research and
pedagogy. VCU IRACDA scholars perform research under the guidance of experienced mentors, and participate
in hands-on mentored teaching at our partner historically black university VSU. The second goal of VCU IRACDA
is to enhance collaborations between VCU and VSU, by expanding the VSU curriculum and promoting research
opportunities for students and faculty. These goals will be accomplished through the following specific aims: (1)
Annually identify at least 6 highly qualified applicants and recruit 2 outstanding postdoctoral scholars to the 3-
year VCU IRACDA program (steady state 6 scholars); (2) Provide VCU IRACDA postdoctoral fellows with
integrated and intensive career development in research and teaching; (3) Enhance the curricular offerings and

Innovative therapy to treat Women with Angina with Nonobstructive CAD (ANOCA) and Coronary
Microvascular Disease(CMD).
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women and men. The scientific community has strived for a
""one size fits all"" approach to reduce our understanding of atherosclerosis to a single unifying model. Sex-
specific mechanisms warrant attention, considering the alarming trend of increasing coronary artery disease
(CAD) in young women. Ischemic heart disease in women is different from that of men. Women have a unique
phenotype with fewer calcified lesions and more nonobstructive disease. Recent studies also identified
differences between sexes in coronary endothelial and/or microvascular dysfunction, with women
demonstrating a higher prevalence of coronary microvascular disease (CMD). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
inhibitors (SGLT2i), a drug class approved for the treatment of diabetes, has been shown to significantly
reduce atherosclerotic events, hospitalization from heart failure (HF), cardiovascular and total mortality, and
progression of chronic kidney disease. New recommendations suggest using SGLT2i in symptomatic patients
with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality,
regardless of type 2 diabetes. In preclinical mouse models of myocardial infarction, SGLT2i improved coronary
microvascular function and increased cardiac output.
Recent studies show that SGLT2 inhibition has possible mechanisms of benefit that are unlikely to be related
to improved glycemic control. There is evidence that SGLT2i targets several pathways. We hypothesize that
SGLT2i treatment will improve CMD in women with ANOCA by different pathways, including reducing markers
of systemic inflammation and improving coronary blood flow, leading to a reduction of the functional impact of
this disease process. In Aim 1, we will test the efficacy of SGLT2i in improving coronary blood flow (CFR) in
women with ANOCA and CMD. CFR will be assessed using stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)
before and after 12 weeks of SGLT2i or placebo treatment. In Aim 2, we will determine whether SGLT2i
treatment improves patients’ quality of life and how this relates to improvement of CMD. We will measure the
quality of life in women treated with SGLT2i or placebo using clinically validated questionnaires at baseline, 6
weeks, and 12 weeks post-treatment. Lastly, Aim 3 will study the impact of SGLT2i treatment on markers of
systemic inflammation and inflammatory pathways in study participants. The proposed investigation will
significantly advance our understanding of the potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in CMD in women with
non-obstructive CAD. Since there is a lack of evidence for treatment in this population, this proposal will
fill an unmet need in managing women with ANOCA and CMD and significantly advance our
understanding of SGLT2 inhibitor's potential benefits in microvascular disease."
10950488,"The cholinergic hypothesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is based on extensive evidence that
excess brain acetylcholine (ACh) contributes to both the onset and worsening of MDD. However, the specific
neurobiological cause of this dysregulated ACh has not been established in humans in vivo. Based on rodent
data and our preliminary data in humans, one potential mechanism for increased ACh is through the vesicular
ACh transporter (VAChT). For the first time we can visualize and quantify VAChT using the positron emission
tomography (PET) tracer [18F]VAT. We have exciting preliminary data in humans without a diagnosis of MDD
but with a range of depressed mood showing that hippocampal levels of VAChT are inversely correlated with
depression severity. Furthermore, published literature demonstrate (1) decreased VAChT levels (which were
associated with higher depression in our data) were associated with increased ACh levels and (2) increased
ACh in individuals with depression, implying that low VAChT levels may underlie the increased ACh in MDD.
VAChT is therefore a highly compelling candidate for driving cholinergic dysregulation and represents a
completely novel target for treating depression. Thus, we propose a high-risk high-reward mechanistic R21 to
validate this hypothesis and provide initial proof of concept to support larger investigations of the cholinergic
system for potential therapeutic developments in MDD. To achieve this, we propose the following aims: Aim 1.
Assess the role of VAChT in the pathophysiology of MDD by fully quantitative PET imaging using
[18F]VAT. We hypothesize that lower VAChT underlies cholinergic alterations (higher acetylcholine) in MDD
based on animal models of depression exhibiting lower 40% VAChT and our preliminary data indicating
VAChT density is inversely correlated with depression severity. We hypothesize that VAChT density is lower in
7 individuals with MDD compared to 7 healthy volunteers without MDD. Aim 2. Demonstrate that acute
nicotine challenge increases VAChT in those with MDD. Although its mechanism has not been fully
elucidated, transdermal nicotine has been demonstrated to be an effective rapid-onset antidepressant in
humans. And in rodents it was demonstrated to increase mRNA expression of VAChT by 54%. Depressed
individuals from Aim 1 will be treated with nicotine. Based on animal models, we hypothesize that the 7-day
nicotine challenge will increase hippocampal VAChT in 7 individuals suffering from MDD. Our proposed high-
risk high-reward mechanistic R21 would be the first study to assess the role of VAChT in MDD
pathophysiology in humans, determine how VAChT is regulated by nicotine, advance our understanding of the
pathophysiology of MDD, stimulate development of novel cholinergic specific therapeutics, and provide proof of
concept to support future larger studies. Our expected outcomes and positive impact at the end of our
mechanistic study are to have demonstrated a first assessment of nicotine’s effect on VAChT in humans,
involved in its antidepressant effects, and to provide insight into the cholinergic contribution to depression."

Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPC) gene therapy has provided clinical benefits in several patients
affected by a variety of genetic diseases, some of which already reached market authorization for selected
indications. However, the use of semi-randomly integrating vectors poses the risk of insertional mutagenesis and
ectopic/unregulated transgene expression. These issues become even more relevant when the affected gene
needs to be highly express to exert its function and when its activity directly impacts genome stability, such as
the case for Recombination-Activating 1 (RAG1) gene. RAG1 is express in a high but tightly regulated manner
in differentiating lymphocyte precursors, where it directs the VDJ recombination process required for assembly
the T- and B-cell receptors, and its inactivating mutations are one of the most frequent causes of severe-
combined immunodeficiency (SCID). While the high risk of genomic damage due to unregulated RAG1
expression has so far hampered the use of viral vectors to treat RAG1 deficiencies, there is a need to develop
novel and effective therapeutic approaches, especially for patients who lacks a compatible HSPC donor or are
not eligible for allogeneic transplant. The long-term goal of our proposal is to address this unmet medical need
and develop an effective novel treatment directed at restoring both function and expression control of
the RAG1 gene on autologous patient derived HSC. Our central hypothesis is that gene repair strategies that
preserve physiologic expression control represent a safe and effective approach for treating RAG1 deficiencies.
We reported that by tailoring culture conditions and gene delivery vehicles, it is possible to partially overcome
the biologic barriers that constrain gene editing in the most primitive and clinically relevant HSPC subsets
(Genovese, Nature 2014; Schiroli, Science-Translational-Medicine 2017). Within this project we will capitalize
our previous achievements to i) directly fix RAG1 mutations, ii) improve efficiency of current HSPC gene editing
protocols and iii) investigate non-genotoxic conditioning on suitable mouse models. Functional correction of the
engineered RAG1 gene will be stringently assessed on patient derived cells, by exploiting state-of-the-art in vitro
T cell differentiation assay and in vivo xenotransplantation experiments. We will take advantage of our recently
optimized gene editing procedure and barcoding technology (BAR-seq, Ferrari et al, Nat. Biotech. 2020) to
maximize editing efficiency while reducing cellular toxicity on the treated HSPC, thus increasing the yield of long-
term engrafting lymphoid cells. To support the rational for clinical testing, we will assess correction of the disease
phenotype by limiting amounts of functional HSPC in two RAG1 murine models and test efficacy of emerging
immunotoxin conditioning regimens to reduce transplant toxicity and increase lymphoid reconstitution. Overall,
this project will contribute to the development of an innovative treatment approach for RAG1 deficiencies and
position homology-based gene editing as a standard for precise HSC engineering, providing for safer and more
efficacious therapeutic strategies with broad applicability in hematology."

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and a lifetime of
neurodevelopmental disabilities and problems of daily living. Early intervention during the first
three years of life has the potential to mitigate the teratogenic effects of PAE at a time of critical
brain development. Timely EI supports young children’s development, strengthens responsive
parenting and the early parent-child relationship, and provides family resources that can reduce
parenting stress. Early intervention by design aims to increase critical early life protective factors
and reduce secondary disabilities associated with the cascade of complex learning and
behavior problems commonly reported among children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
(FASD). Yet there is a concerning lack of effective, evidence-based practices for this vulnerable
group of young children at a crucial time of child development. Our research team has
developed the Families Moving Forward (FMF) Bridges early intervention for infants and
toddlers affected by PAE or with FASD and their caregivers. This innovative early intervention
was adapted from the scientifically validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program originally
designed and shown to be efficacious for preschool and school-aged children with FASD. FMF
Bridges blends standard FMF approaches that are FASD-informed with the essential elements
of early childhood intervention best practices that are relationship-based, strengths-based, and
family-centered. This study aims to examine the feasibility of the FMF Bridges early intervention
in two phases. In both Phases, the FMF Bridges intervention will be delivered by trained
community early intervention providers in partnering community-based birth to three settings.
Phase 1 will be a small trial to examine if the FMF Bridges early intervention is feasible to
implement in the community settings for which it was designed. Participants will be 12 children,
ages 6-36 months with PAE or FASD, and their caregivers. Phase 2 will examine the feasibility
of a pilot randomized controlled trial using methods and intervention refinements informed by
Phase 1 data. Thirty-six children, ages 6-36 months, and their caregivers will be enrolled across
three participating early intervention sites. Eighteen families each will be randomized to either
FMF Bridges or waitlist control conditions. Study results will inform a larger scale clinical trial of
FMF Bridges as an FASD-informed early intervention that aims to enhance usual care in
community birth to three settings for this very vulnerable group of young children."
10950490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal seeks to understand and predict the onset and duration of the menopause transition using a
Systems Metabolic approach. Menopause, which is the complete cessation of menstruation, increases the risks
of cardiovascular disorders, osteoporosis, depression, and cognitive decline. The menopause transition,
occurring roughly 3-5 years before menopause, in same cases it can last up to 10 years, is marked by reduced
quality of life due to symptoms like hot flashes, sleep problems, migraines, lack of concentration, and irritability.
Current clinical tools such as Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) or Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) can detect
whether the menopause transition has already started but cannot estimate its commencement or duration.
Identifying better biomarkers is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the ovary,
compounded by the presence of different cell types in the ovary such as somatic (e.g., estrogen producers),
stromal, immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells. To understand the role of ovarian spatiotemporal heterogeneity
in the menopause transition and the decline of reproductive potential, a systems approach is needed to consider
spatial and age-dependent inter- and intra-cellular signaling and metabolic communication within the ovary.
Genome-scale metabolic models (GMMs) are network-based systems approaches that have been used to study
inter- and intra-cellular metabolic communication in the ovary. While current ovarian GMMs are cell-specific and
multicellular, they have not accounted yet for cell location within the ovary or explored ovarian aging, both crucial
for understanding the menopause transition. We plan to address these limitations by generating spatially-
informed cell-specific multicellular GMMs) to identify ovarian-produced metabolites that can be secreted into
circulation and are significantly associated with the state of the menopause transition, and hence could serve as
novel biomarkers of reproductive potential its rate of decline. Our long-term goal is to create a platform for early
prediction of menopause transition onset and duration to reduce the risk of menopause-related diseases. Our
overarching hypothesis is that the integration of dynamic multi-omics data (single-cell and spatial transcriptomics
and non-targeted metabolomics) with prior metabolomic knowledge encoded into GMMs could serve to identify
novel metabolic markers of reproductive potential and its rate of decline. Test this, we aim to develop spatially-
informed cell-specific multicellular GMMs using publicly and newly collected single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics data from prepubertal (3 weeks) to reproductive aged mice (18 months); and identify ovarian-
synthesized metabolites measurable in circulation and significantly associated with reproduction potential and
its rate of decline. Success in this proposal could identify minimally-invasive biomarkers that can prospectively
predict the rate of decline in reproductive potential and lay the groundwork for future interventions to delay early
or premature menopause, alleviate symptoms, and reduce the risk of future menopause-related diseases. Our
dynamic spatially-informed network-based models could be applied to study aging in other organs, e.g., brain."

Adolescence, the developmental transition of juvenile social and cognitive processes to their adult forms, is a
period of remarkable physiological, psychological, and social changes. During adolescence there is a significant
increase in the risk for psychiatric disorders such that half of people who will suffer from mental illness have their
onset by 14 years of age. Early research suggests that it is a pivotal transition for youth with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD), a condition characterized by difficulty with social competence and change including
developmental transitions. During the initial phase of the longitudinal study (MH111599), significant, clinically
meaningful findings regarding autistic youth were revealed including: 1) dynamic and significant developmental
effects of age on biobehavioral profiles, 2) advanced pubertal onset especially in autistic females, #3) elevated
risk for depression emerging in early adolescence, 4) physiological dysregulation increasing with age and
symptom severity and associated with depression, and 5) unique and complex profiles of sex and gender. These
studies have provided the foundation and data for our competing renewal application, which is aligned with the
NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 2 “…to examine mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to
intervene.” The overarching goal is on mental health risk (e.g., depression) and resiliency (e.g., coping) and
potential moderating factors that may impact individual outcomes including diagnosis (autistic, neurotypical),
development (age, puberty), sex (female, male) and gender (binary, non-binary) over adolescence. This
research will help identify sensitive periods to reduce risk and prevent the onset of mental illnesses. Due to
advanced pubertal timing in ASD and a significant rise in mental illness (e.g., depression) in early adolescence,
studying the prepubescent period is essential. To examine developmental changes, the study will use a rigorous
accelerated longitudinal design (ALD) corresponding with pre-, peri-, and pubertal development. Three cohorts
will be enrolled at ages 8-9 (N=80), 10-11 (N=80) and 12-13 (N=80) followed over a four-year study period.
Additionally, the previous cohort ages 15-17 (ASD N=64; TD N=60) will be followed providing a broad age span
(8-17 years). The aims will address three areas. Aim 1: When: will examine the impact and unique contributions
of adolescence and puberty on mental health profile based on diagnosis (ASD vs. TD) and Sex (Females vs.
Males). Aim 2. Where: will examine social and emotional functioning during naturalistic interactions with peers.
Aim 3. How: will examine physiological responses at the level of the central nervous system (event related
potential), HPA axis (cortisol), and peripheral nervous system (heart rate variability) as plausible biobehavioral
targets that predict risk and resiliency. An exploratory aim, Why: to explore key risk factors that impact mental
health over adolescence and puberty to inform individual biopsychosocial profiles and treatment. The project will
extend the MH111599 by focusing on mental health and key developmental, physiological, socioemotional, and
demographic factors that confer risk or resiliency in youth with ASD or TD."
10954404,"In an animal’s life, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis – cell suicide, to support development
and maintain body homeostasis. In addition, during stroke, cancer, and other traumatic situations, a large
number of cells undergo necrosis after injury. These cells are rapidly internalized by other cells via
phagocytosis (engulfment) and degraded inside engulfing cells. The swift removal of dying cells prevents
tissue injury, inflammatory responses, and auto-immune responses, clears the wounded area, and promotes
tissue repair. Necrosis is also closely associated with neuron degeneration. The phagocytosis of necrotic
neurons and axon debris facilitates the repair and recovery of neuron functions. Phagocytic activity by the
microglia also contributes to the loss of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease. My long-term goal is to understand
how dying cells are specifically recognized, internalized, and degraded by engulfing cells, using the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. As many physiological mechanisms are highly conserved
throughout evolution, what we learn from C. elegans can be translated to humans. This proposal investigates
the mechanisms that promote the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), an “eat me” signal, on the surfaces of
necrotic and apoptotic cells to attract engulfing cells. In C. elegans, the necrosis of six mechanosensory
neurons (also called touch neurons) is induced by mutations in a particular group of plasma membrane ion
channel proteins, including the dominant mutations in MEC-4, a subunit of the mechanosensory Na+ channel.
We found that two proteins, the ABC transporter CED-7, and ANOH-1, the worm homolog of the mammalian
phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F, act in parallel to promote PS exposure on the surfaces of necrotic cells.
Recently, we have identified that the exposure of PS on necrotic cells is mediated by cytoplasmic Ca2+.
Furthermore, we discovered two alternative mechanisms that increase Ca2+ level in the cytoplasm, one
dependent on the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the other independent of the ER. In
addition, we have identified multiple genes that act to regulate PS exposure. To further investigate the
molecular mechanism(s) of PS exposure, I propose to determine the novel functions of a transthyretin-like
protein and a proposed PS flippase in promoting the exposure of PS on the surfaces of necrotic cells in
response to the Ca2+ signaling (Aims 1 and 2), and to identify new PS-exposure genes from mutants defective
in the exposure of PS on dying cells that we isolated in a forward genetic screen (Aim 3). In this diversity
supplement application, Jonathan Pickett, a graduate student, will expand Aim 3 by identifying the roles of a
new family of proteins (Bridge-like Lipid Transfer Proteins) and bulk lipid transfer events in the recognition of
dying cells and the initiation of engulfment. Together, the outcomes will allow us to establish pathways that
promote PS exposure in response to upstream signals. They will also reveal novel molecular mechanisms
regulating each step of the process, some of which are anticipated to be unique to necrotic or apoptotic cells."

of CLAMS Comprehensive lab animal system, which will further improve the services provided by
Integrated Physiology of Aging Core (IPAC) of the Nathan Shock Center (NSC) in San Antonio. The
IPA core has been a part of the NSC for more than 29 years to support the overall mission of the
San Antonio Nathan Shock Center to enable research that aims to expand our understanding of
mechanisms of aging and of age-associated disease. The IPA core will provide intellectual and
instrumental/technical services to the scien�ﬁc community on the selec�on and performance of
func�onal assays in rodents that aim to increase our knowledge about mechanisms that control
age-related changes in func�on at the �ssue, organ, and whole-body levels, in the context of
normal aging and in rela�on to age-related diseases. We provide exper�se and assistance to
inves�gators with an interest in aging-related ques�ons in the design and execu�on, as well as
data analysis and interpreta�on on experimental measures. Of all the services oﬀered, the
metabolic analysis of aged mice, in response to therapeu�cal interven�on, is an indispensable
component in the IPA core. For the metabolic analysis, a CLAMS Comprehensive lab animal
system can be used to monitor water consump�on, food intake, locomotor ac�vity, O2/CO2 and
energy expenditure, crucial parameters to represent the healthspan in aged mice. With this key
piece of equipment, the service quality in IPA core will be greatly enhanced. Thus, the request for
addi�onal new equipment conforms to the stated purpose of suppor�ng and enhancing shared
resources and facility for categorical research by a number of inves�gators from diﬀerent
disciplines. The integra�on of the San Antonio IPA Core with other programs to study mechanisms
of the aging process has been an obvious beneﬁt to these studies. The incorpora�on of a highly
advanced CLAMS Comprehensive lab animal system will allow us to provide service to monitor
healthspan in diﬀerent species during aging and by various interven�ons.

10951398,"Project Summary
Over the past two decades, single-molecule assays (SIMOA) have transformed the detection landscape for low-
abundance protein biomarkers, such as cytokines and neurological markers, across a vast dynamic range.
Sourced from a variety of samples, these assays provide exceptional capabilities that enhance our knowledge
of diseases and fine-tune diagnostic methodologies. While various platforms have been developed and
commercialized, they invariably involve intricate workflows and depend on highly specialized, bulky equipment.
Such complexities confine the use of this technology to centralized labs, necessitating controlled environments
and skilled operators.
To meet these challenges, we introduce a compact SIMOA system that seamlessly integrates electronics and
sub-µm sized microfluidics within a single integrated circuit (IC) chip, produced by semiconductor foundries. The
creation of the microfluidics leverages a unique single-step wet-etching process, which facilitates the efficient
integration of thousands of fluidic and electronic channels onto a compact, millimeter-sized CMOS chip. Drawing
from the principles of flow-cytometry-based and nanopore-centric SIMOA platforms, our system electronically
counts individual sandwiched immunocomplexes as they pass through the on-chip 500-nm pores. Notably, the
IC itself stands as the main instrument, enabling results to be directly viewed on a personal device, eliminating
the need for a reader.
The project objective will be achieved by four specific aims: (1) Aim I will focus on implementing the CMOS-
embedded microfluidics, the sensing on-chip pores, integrated on-chip electrodes, and the magnetic separation
module. (2) Aim II will focus on developing resistive-pulse-sensing low-noise readout circuits and signal
processing units for digitization and identification of the binding events. The integrated microfluidics/electronics
system will be packaged, tested, and validated. (3) Aim III will focus on the functionalization of nanoparticles
using target-specific antibodies. We will target three biomarkers, ɑ-synuclein, NfL, and GFAP, that are related to
neurodegenerative diseases. (4) Aim IV will optimize the workflow and validate the assay by benchmarking with
the established commercial SIMOAs. This project holds significant promise; its successful completion could
transform future diagnostics for many diseases that require detecting low-abundant biomarkers, particularly
benefiting settings with limited resources."
10951450,"SUMMARY
Alcohol is the most commonly used licit substance in pregnancy, and cannabis is the most commonly used illicit
substance in pregnancy. Approximately half of pregnant people who use cannabis also use alcohol, and one
third of pregnant people who used alcohol also used cannabis. Both substances are associated with adverse
outcomes among offspring, including preterm birth, small for gestational age offspring, and adverse
neurodevelopmental outcomes, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in alcohol-exposed offspring. There
is accumulating evidence that prenatal co-exposure to cannabis and alcohol confers greater risks to the
developing fetus than either exposure alone, although data are primarily from animal models. Further, there is
no evidence from pregnant populations of whether cannabis is used simultaneously with alcohol, and whether
cannabis substitutes or complements alcohol use over the highly dynamic time of pregnancy. Of additional
concern, there is accumulating evidence that paternal preconceptional exposure to cannabis and alcohol may
directly and indirectly increase the risk of adverse offspring outcomes.
The purpose of this developmental proposal is to gather information about alcohol and cannabis use before,
during and after pregnancy, for both the pregnant individual and the biologic father, to support the feasibly of a
larger cohort in the future. This proposal will elucidate distinct patterns of alcohol and cannabis use and co-use
that are necessary to power future studies, and the feasibility of enrolling and interviewing biologic fathers about
their own use. Our team includes a perinatal epidemiologist with research expertise in pregnancy cohort studies
and prenatal alcohol and cannabis use, a Maternal-Fetal-Medicine specialist with research expertise in alcohol,
cannabis and paternal exposures, and a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction during pregnancy. From San
Diego County, we will recruit 100 pregnant individuals who used cannabis and alcohol in the three months prior
to pregnancy, and their male partners. We will collect detailed information on alcohol and cannabis use and co-
use over the course of the pregnancy, using methods shown to be reliable in other pregnancy cohort studies.
The aims are to 1) Characterize the patterns of maternal alcohol and cannabis use before, during, and
after pregnancy, 2) Characterize the patterns of paternal alcohol and cannabis use before, during, and
after pregnancy, and 3). Model individual and joint trajectories of exposure for pregnant individuals and
their partners.
Success in this project will reveal the patterns of alcohol and cannabis use before, during and after pregnancy,
by the pregnant person and the biologic father. These data are critical to inform future studies of the direct and
indirect effects of parental use of alcohol and cannabis, and to inform intervention efforts and guide counseling."

The PI’s long-term goal is to become an independent researcher characterizing neurodevelopmental and phys-
iologic mechanisms of sensorimotor integration in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their relation to clinical
and cognitive outcomes. In pursuit of this goal, the PI has assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team (Drs.
Mosconi, Brumberg, Schmitt, Veatch, and Wang) to support critical training in sensorimotor physiology and de-
velopment in typical development (TD) and ASD; electroencephalography (EEG); computational analysis of
physiologic and clinical data; and assessment of persons with intellectual disability (ID). The proposed studies
were designed to scaffold the training activities and establish the PI’s independent line of research.
Sensorimotor deficits are prevalent in ASD and are associated with poorer social-communication and cognitive
outcomes, signifying their pivotal role in the development of ASD. Sensorimotor deficits are also common in ID
and may be physiologically distinct from those specific to ASD, but individuals with ID, which affects about a third
of the autistic population, are often excluded from studies of ASD. Studies of sensorimotor physiology that include
autistic individuals with ID are needed to identify physiologic mechanisms contributing to varied clinical and cog-
nitive expression in ASD and develop interventions that improve outcomes for autistic individuals. The objective
of the proposed project is to clarify sensory feedback and brain mechanisms associated with deficient control of
sustained motor behaviors in autistic individuals with and without ID and assess their relation to clinical and
cognitive traits. Forty typically developing (TD) controls (aged 8-17yrs), 40 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched autistic
individuals and 40 age- and sex-matched autistic individuals with ID will complete tests of precision gripping (fine
motor) and postural control (gross motor) with and without EEG. We will manipulate the quality of visual (gain)
and somatosensory (tendon vibration; without EEG only) feedback to assess their contributions to each motor
behavior. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that disrupting either sensory input will lead to poorer
control of both behaviors in TD controls, but autistic individuals will show decrements only when the primary
sensory input (vision for gripping, somatosensory for posture) is disrupted, and this will be associated with re-
duced coherence within parietal-motor networks. We also predict greater postural control deficits in autistic indi-
viduals with ID when somatosensory feedback is unperturbed, suggesting reduced responsiveness to soma-
tosensory feedback during gross motor control in ID, and reduced frontal-parietal coherence during both behav-
iors, consistent with reduced cognitive engagement during sustained motor control in individuals with ID. We
also will exploit the power of supervised machine learning to identify patterns of sensorimotor physiology that
predict clinical and cognitive traits. These studies hold promise for informing neurodevelopmental models of ASD
and identifying targets for the development of novel interventions to improve quality of life for autistic individuals."
