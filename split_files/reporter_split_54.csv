Chromosomal translocations occur in nearly all human lymphoid neoplasms, many the result of aberrant repair
of DNA double-stand breaks (DSBs) generated in pre-B cells during V(D)J recombination. In this pathological
process, unrepaired V(D)J DSBs induced at the IgH locus join with a second, non-IgH DSB to generate the
translocation. The non-IgH DSBs occur by an unknown mechanism, representing a serious knowledge gap. The
rationale for this project arose from creation of a sequencing database composed of DNA translocation
breakpoint junctions mapped from over 2,000 human patients covering most B cell malignancies. This analysis
uncovered 6 non-IgH human fragile zones (HFZs) ranging in size from 20-600 bp where DSBs are enriched up
to 1,000-fold compared to the surrounding DNA. HFZ DSBs account for half of all human B cell cancers and
break in the pre-B cell stage of development concurrent with V(D)J recombination. Building on a foundation of
previous work, the central hypothesis is that three factors are critical for HFZ DSBs in lymphoid cells: 1)
Formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) structures at HFZs resulting from torsional stress, 2) Expression of
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that targets ssDNA to create mismatched DNA lesions, and 3)
Presence of an activated form of the structure-specific Artemis endonuclease that cleaves these lesions to
generate the HFZ DSBs. The overall objectives for this proposal are: (1) Utilize digital PCR (dPCR) and DNA
sequencing assays to quantify DNA DSB formation at HFZs under conditions that will elucidate the HFZ DSB
mechanism and (2) show how loss of topoisomerase function through pharmacologic or genetic ablation
enhances HFZ DSB formation. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To
determine how torsional stress stabilizes ssDNA structures at HFZs, 2) To determine the role of AID in HFZ
DSBs, and 3) To delineate how Artemis induces HFZ DSBs. The innovative aspects of this research are that
human patient data was used as a source to demonstrate that many B cell malignances are the result of non-
random DSBs at discreet 20-600 bp HFZs, human pre-B cell lines and primary human cells are used in the
analysis, and the genetic assays used can quantify indels resulting from DSB formation and repair in human pre-
B cell lines and patient material. This work is significant as it defines a unified mechanism for many B cell
malignances involving multiple steps, each of which can be affected by an individual’s genetics and lifestyle.
Results from this proposal would represent a significant advancement towards predicting disease in high-risk
populations and tailoring treatments to individuals. Furthermore, our assays can be applied in the clinic to quickly
diagnose diseases with a genome instability component and monitor a patient’s response to treatment and
potential for relapse. Overall, the results will lead to early detection of primary cancers, prevention of secondary
cancers, and an overall reduction in mortality."
10882549,"Despite recent progress in the identification of mediators of podocyte injury, mechanisms underlying podocyte
loss remain poorly understood, and cell-specific therapy is lacking. Our long-term goal is to elucidate critical
signaling pathways that disrupt podocyte cytoarchitecture in order to identify targets for therapeutic intervention
for glomerular diseases. Our work has identified KIBRA (encoded by WWC1) as a key regulator of glomerular
disease progression, podocyte cytostructure, and podocyte injury via downstream LATS kinase activation and
YAP inhibition in the canonical Hippo signaling pathway. However, little is known about the regulation of
WWC1/KIBRA expression, and therapeutic implications for KIBRA upregulation in FSGS and diabetic
nephropathy remain unclear. Additionally, our preliminary data support non-canonical direct KIBRA downstream
regulation of transcription factors TEAD 1-4. The overall objectives of this application are to define the regulators
of WWC1/KIBRA expression and function in podocytes, test non-canonical KIBRA-TEAD signaling, and to target
LATS and TEAD as novel therapeutic strategies for KIBRA-mediated and diabetic podocyte injury. Based on our
preliminary RNA-seq analysis, our central hypothesis is that WWC1/KIBRA function in podocytes is repressed
by the micro-RNA 200 family and regulated by transcription factors such as SOX4. In addition to canonical KIBRA
regulation of LATS/YAP, KIBRA non-canonically directly suppresses TEAD 1-4 expression. Together, these
downstream signaling events disrupt podocyte structural integrity and podocyte-glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) adhesion, thereby promoting glomerular disease progression. The rationale for the proposed research is
that testing novel regulators of KIBRA, non-canonical KIBRA signaling, and both novel canonical and non-
canonical therapeutic approaches will significantly increase understanding of the mechanisms underlying
glomerular disease progression and advance the quest for new selective treatments. Our hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1 will test novel micro-RNA and transcriptional regulation of
WWC1/KIBRA expression and function and will define the biomechanical sequelae of KIBRA-mediated podocyte
structural disruption. Aim 2 will test downstream KIBRA non-canonical regulation of TEAD 1-4 and the effects of
LATS kinase depletion and inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will test the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacologic
TEAD agonists and LATS inhibitors individually and combined as multi-targeted therapy for KIBRA-mediated
and diabetic disease models in vitro and in vivo. The work proposed here is expected to define disease relevant
regulators of podocyte KIBRA expression and elucidate novel targets and treatment strategies for glomerular
diseases."

Alcohol misuse and its consequences peaks during emerging adulthood (the period of life between the ages of
18 to 25). Concurrently, during this time, many individuals head into the workforce. While previous research
has documented that there are certain occupations that are associated with alcohol misuse, little is known
about how newcomers’ alcohol use changes when entering these occupations that are characterized as high-risk
for alcohol misuse. Guided by the organizational socialization literature and social learning theory, the
proposed project aims to provide a better understanding of the transition into these high-risk occupations for
alcohol misuse and to examine how the social environment influences alcohol use. A national sample of
emerging adults (N= 400) before they start at high-risk occupations for alcohol misuse will be recruited. The
five high-risk work occupations for alcohol misuse are the following: 1) construction and extraction, 2)
installation, maintenance, and repair, 3) food preparation and serving related, 4) transportation and material-
moving, and 5) sales and related occupations. Participants will be followed over 2 years, in which they will
complete 7 assessments and 5 one-week “bursts” of daily diary assessments. Participants will report on the
characteristics of the work environment, including the amount of alcohol use among coworkers and managers
at work, and their own alcohol use. Findings from this study will inform prevention and intervention efforts to
reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related consequences. High-risk work environments for alcohol use could
provide training on alcohol use, which would be beneficial to the organization (e.g., by reducing absenteeism,
turnover, etc.) and the individual (e.g., reducing alcohol-related consequences). Furthermore, most prevention
efforts for young adults occur in college settings and ignore those who head directly into the workforce thus
putting those that head directly into the workforce after high school at risk."

 This project will use model RNA plant viruses to elucidate the mechanisms used by viruses to target
nucleoli and regulate chromatin dynamics and host gene expression. Specifically, we will investigate how the
p26 protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) modulates host chromatin and gene expression by
undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and partitioning into the nucleolus. We will perform both Assay
for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
analyses during infection with wild-type or PEMV2-mutant viruses. These experiments will allow us to determine
the extent to which p26 and PEMV2 influence chromatin accessibility and gene expression. The overarching
objective of this study is to ascertain whether p26 and PEMV2 repress antiviral genes by inducing chromatin
compaction while concurrently enhancing the expression of pro-viral genes by relaxing the surrounding
chromatin. Next, we will utilize 2'-O-methylation sequencing (2OMe-seq) to determine whether p26 disrupts the
function of fibrillarin in the nucleolus to alter the methylation patterns of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Since
disruption of snRNA methylation impacts pre-mRNA splicing, we will investigate whether p26 alters alternative
splicing pathways to alter host protein expression and/or function.
 In addition to the research objectives outlined above, this project places a strong emphasis on training
undergraduate researchers to conduct experiments and analyze data using safe and accessible plant virus
systems. To further enhance the impact of this work on the undergraduate student body, the research findings
will be directly incorporated into the undergraduate bioinformatics course at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City (UMKC). This way, >20 students/year will be exposed to hands-on bioinformatics techniques and gain
valuable skills in analyzing real-world data. Overall, this study will provide a comprehensive understanding of
how nucleoli shape virus-host interactions and provide meaningful research experiences for underrepresented
students at UMKC."
10881159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Altered cell-surface glycosylation is recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Two frequently observed cancer-
associated glyco-phenotypes are hypersialylation and mucin overexpression. These cancer glycosylation
patterns strongly correlate with disease aggressiveness and poor patient outcomes, but until recently their
functional significance was unclear.
 In previous funding periods, we discovered that hypersialylation allows cancer cells to evade immune
surveillance through engagement of immune inhibitory Siglec receptors. We speculate that poor responses of
cancer patients to current immune therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, T cell checkpoint receptor
blockade, bispecific T cell engagers and targeted cell therapies, are due to immune suppression via the
Siglec/sialoglycan axis. Accordingly, we developed a new class of immune therapies comprising antibody-
sialidase conjugates that degrade Siglec ligands on targeted cancer cells.
 In collaborative work, we found that mucin glycoproteins promote focal adhesion formation and enhance
cancer cell survival and proliferation in the metastatic niche by virtue of their bulk physical properties. We also
discovered that certain cancer-associated mucin glycoforms engage Siglec receptors thereby mediating immune
suppression. These dual functions of cancer mucins make them attractive targets for cancer therapy.
Accordingly, we made targeted mucin degraders comprising mucin-specific proteases fused to cancer antigen-
binding nanobodies. Nanobody-mucinase fusions had anti-metastatic and immune potentiating activities in
mouse cancer models.
 In the next funding period, we will build on these discoveries with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
develop targeted mucin degraders based on engineered human proteases, an important step toward clinical
translation. In Aim 2, we will explore a new approach to precision targeting of mucin degraders to shed and
secreted mucins that are immune suppressive in circulation. Finally, in Aim 3 we will develop a new cancer
immune therapy modality comprising antibody-lectin chimeras (AbLecs). These bispecific molecules
simultaneously bind cancer antigens, block immune suppressive glycan ligands, and mediate immune effector
functions via their Fc domains. Overall, the proposed work will set the stage for preclinical development
of two new therapeutic strategies targeting the cancer glycocalyx."

The major OBJECTIVES in this application are to expand understanding of mediators of fibrogenic injury
and HCC development associated with impaired VLDL secretion in both mice and humans. Our proposal
is SIGNIFICANT because of the unmet need to identify subsets of patients with NAFLD whose disease will
progress and where a more tailored approach might inform therapeutic strategies for prevention and reversal of
NASH/fibrosis and the development of HCC. The BACKGROUND is that genetic defects (APOB, MTTP,
TM6SF2) that impair hepatic VLDL secretion cause hepatic steatosis and progress to NASH with fibrosis and
HCC, even without obesity or insulin resistance. In addition, VLDL secretion is relatively (ie paradoxically)
impaired in a subset of insulin-resistant, NAFLD patients. Accordingly, our overall SCIENTIFIC PREMISE is that
identifying shared pathways in genetically modified mouse models and in metabolic subset of patients
with NASH and impaired hepatic VLDL secretion will identify druggable targets for fibrosis reversal and
prevention of HCC. Our proposal is supported by KEY PRELIMINARY DATA including: (AIM 1) Liver-specific
Tm6sf2 knockout mice (Tm6-LKO), phenocopies the loss-of-function human TM6SF2 (E167K) variant
rs58542926 with defective VLDL secretion, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and increased HCC. We generated
Tm6sf2 variant knockin (K167K) mice to examine hepatic VLDL and intestinal chylomicron secretion. We
generated variant knockin HepG2 cells and iPS-derived hepatocyte-like cell lines to study the loss-of-function
variant in human VLDL assembly. (AIM 2). Liver-specific microsomal triglyceride transfer protein knockout mice
(Mttp-LKO) mice crossed into Fabp1–/– mice (ML-DKO) mice exhibit reduced steatosis and decreased fibrosis,
yet paradoxically increased HCC. By contrast Mttp-LKO mice crossed into liver-specific DGAT2 knockout mice
are protected against HCC. We identified a metabolomic signature in patients with NAFLD/NASH that aligns
with impaired VLDL secretion and will examine patients with NASH-HCC. The AIMS of this proposal are: AIM 1.
How does how the Tm6sf2 variant alter APOB lipidation and regulate hepatic and intestinal VLDL/chylomicron
assembly and secretion? How does the K167K variant influence the development of fibrosis and HCC? How
are these pathways in mouse VLDL assembly and secretion replicated in representative human hepatocyte-like
cell lines (HepG2, iPS-derived hepatocyte-like cells)? AIM 2. How do modifiers of DNL and LD turnover modify
signaling pathways in mice with impaired VLDL secretion (Mttp-LKO) that either promote (Fabp1-dependent) or
mitigate (Dgat2-dependent) HCC development? We will examine how pathways identified in mice with impaired
VLDL secretion and either increased or decreased HCC susceptibility align with transcriptomic signatures in liver
of patients with NASH-HCC and a metabotype of impaired VLDL secretion. Taken together, we address a
CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP by exploring novel pathways of fibrogenic injury and HCC, focusing on defective
VLDL secretion as a nexus point directly relevant to a subset of genetic and acquired etiologies of NAFLD/NASH."

10882484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The sinoatrial node (SAN) is a tiny structure consisting of a precise arrangement of specialized
pacemaker cardiomyocytes (PCs) that trigger each heartbeat. Sinus node dysfunction (SND), resulting
from loss or malfunction of PCs, is a common and morbid disease that is not well understood. There is
currently no treatment that can delay or prevent SND, so sufferers must undergo permanent pacemaker
implantation. This proposal will leverage novel tools and experimental approaches to determine how a
multipotent population of SAN progenitor cells are allocated to different fates within the SAN, and to
define how transcriptional hierarchies govern gene expression programs and spatial organization in the
SAN. Ultimately, we hope that our findings will lead to new approaches to prevent or reverse SND by
targeting the biological pathways that control SAN formation and maintenance. Previous efforts in this
area have been hampered by the lack of specific genetic tools to mark the SAN progenitor population
and the lack of an in vitro system that can model SAN development. In the past, our group has co-
discovered a key activating role for the transcription factor Isl1 in SAN development and we have
identified an Isl1 SAN Enhancer (ISE) that is specifically active in the SAN and its progenitor population.
We have used this enhancer to generate a new mouse line, ISE-CreERT2, that allows conditional
genetic modification of the SAN progenitor population. Clonal fate mapping with this mouse line and
single cell sequencing analysis have defined the dynamics of the SAN progenitor population and
allowed us to develop a system to explore how SAN progenitors are allocated among several possible
fates. To gain further insight into how this fate allocation occurs, we developed a novel in vitro protocol
using hiPSCs that recapitulates key aspects of SAN differentiation, including diversification of SAN
progenitors into anatomically and functionally distinct pacemaker cardiomyocyte subtypes. Using this
model, with in vivo studies as validation, the present work explores the hypothesis that SAN progenitor
allocation depends upon Isl1, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and Nuclear Factor I (NFI) transcriptional
programs that guide cells in the SAN progenitor field to different fates. In Aim 1, we will determine how
Isl1 shifts from playing a role in regulating cardiac progenitor cell proliferation to playing a key role in
activating the PC-specific gene expression in a cellular subtype-specific manner. In Aim 2 we will
determine how AP-1 and NFI regulate progenitor cell allocation and adoption of cell type-specific gene
programs in the SAN. Aim 3 will determine how these pathways regulate the spatial architecture of the
SAN using spatial transcriptomics in WT and genetically modified mice. Taken together, the work
proposed will establish new mechanistic paradigms for the how the mammalian cardiac pacemaker is
formed and could set the stage for novel approaches to treating and preventing SND."
10882554,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related condition in which
hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow undergo somatic mutations that lead to overgrowth (“clones”) of a
genetically distinct subpopulation of blood cells. Evidence is mounting that CHIP is causally related through pro-
inflammatory signaling to the occurrence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and heart failure (HF).
Our preliminary data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) suggests that CHIP may be associated specifically
with risk of incident heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a HF subtype characterized by chronic,
low-grade inflammation. Prior studies of CHIP were cross-sectional and limited information is available on
behavioral/lifestyle, environmental, and heritable risk factors for CHIP progression. The large (N~161,000), multi-
ethnic, prospective WHI, which enrolled post-menopausal women during 1993-1998 is particularly well-suited to
address these limitations because of its longitudinal design, availability of extensive exposure and phenotype
data, and ongoing surveillance of incident disease/mortality among older women, including HFpEF and HFrEF.
In our competing renewal application, we will continue to utilize the unique resources of the WHI, as well as other
cohorts and large biobanks, to address several questions of high clinical importance related to the epidemiology
of CHIP, heart failure, and its aging-related comorbidities. During the current funding period, a subset of ~7,000
of the original WHI cohort who underwent a subsequent examination and blood sampling in 2012 (ranging from
14 to 19 years after WHI enrollment) as part of the WHI Long Life Study (LLS)-1 exam have undergone deep
targeted CHIP sequencing of blood samples collected at two time points, baseline and LLS-1. We plan to expand
this longitudinal CHIP resource by sequencing another 5,000 surviving WHI participants using samples collected
at the upcoming LLS-2 exam in 2023-2024 including a third time point in 3,000 WHI LLS-1 participants. Together
these data motivate further studies to investigate risk factors and specific driver mutations associated with CHIP
clonal expansion over a ~30-year period spanning WHI baseline through LL2-2 exams (Aim 1). Validation of any
association findings with CHIP progression will be facilitated in additional data sets with WGS using a newly
developed in-silico PACER single timepoint approach. In Aim 2, we will perform targeted CHIP sequencing in a
large case-cohort of incident HF adjudicated during follow-up (N>5,000 WHI cases and the same number of
matched controls) to further assess associations between baseline CHIP and incident heart failure subtypes
(HFpEF vs. HFrEF) and replicate findings using additional HF and echo/MRI-based LV function data in other
cohorts. In addition, we will explore whether any CHIP-HF associations are modified by other aging-related risk
factors or HF comorbidities such as frailty, anemia, or physical activity. Informed by results from Aim 1 and 2, in
Aim 3 we will assess causal mediation and underlying mechanisms by which CHIP and CHIP gene subtypes
contribute to HFpEF, HFrEF, and other CVD outcomes using an integrative multi-omics approach."
10883199,"ABSTRACT
Efficient repair of DNA base lesions, such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or DNA
alkylation damage, is critical to maintain genome stability and prevent mutations that can lead to cancer.
Repair of these abundant classes of DNA lesions is the responsibility of the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
and base excision repair (BER) pathways. The importance of efficient excision repair is highlighted by the
severe phenotypes of patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which have inherited defects in NER genes,
and the cancer predisposition of individuals with variants in key BER genes. While the basic mechanisms by
which the NER and BER pathways repair DNA base lesions are well understood, how these excision repair
pathways efficiently recognize and repair DNA lesions resident in eukaryotic chromatin is unclear. To address
this question, we have developed a new high-throughput sequencing method known as MNase-CPD-seq,
which provides an unprecedented snapshot of the dynamics of damaged nucleosomes in UV-irradiated cells.
Our preliminary MNase-CPD-seq data indicate that damaged nucleosomes rapidly alter their rotational setting
to move CPDs to more accessible Minor-Out rotational settings, and at later repair time points, alter
translational positioning to expand linker regions between nucleosomes. These preliminary data form the basis
of Aim I, where we will use MNase-CPD-seq to characterize the role of damage recognition factors, such as
XPC or UV-DDB, and histone modifications in promoting repositioning of damaged nucleosomes in yeast and
human cells and in vitro. In parallel, we also plan to develop related methods to map nucleosome dynamics
associated with other classes of DNA lesions (i.e., UV-induced 6-4 photoproducts and N-methylpurine (NMP)
lesions). In Aim II, we will test the hypothesis that ACR complexes in yeast and human cells are required for
efficient repair of UV damage in chromatin by repositioning damaged nucleosomes during repair. We will also
investigate how ACR mutants affect UV mutagenesis in UV-exposed yeast cells and human skin cancers.
Finally, in the previous award we identified novel roles for histone PTMs in regulating distinct NER and BER
pathways in chromatin. Aim III will build on the studies by characterizing the mechanisms by which histone
acetylation regulates NER and BER in yeast chromatin, and the role of histone H3 K36 methylation by Set2 in
yeast and SETD2 in human cells in regulating canonical and cryptic transcription coupled-nucleotide excision
repair (TC-NER). Since ACR subunits (e.g., ARID2) and SETD2 are frequently mutated in human cancers,
including melanoma, these studies have important implications to mechanisms of carcinogenesis and
chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer."

The objective of this proposal is to request a circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter to enhance the
biomedical research and education capabilities at UMass Dartmouth and in Southern Massachusetts. The
requested instrument is a JASCO CD spectropolarimeter that covers a broad spectral range (163-1600 nm)
and comes with accessories, including a temperature control stage, micro-sampling, titration system, and a
solid-state measurement unit. Biological molecules are chiral, and their structures play a crucial role in
regulating cellular functions and impacting human diseases. The CD spectropolarimeter is a valuable tool for
characterizing these structures. The requested instrument will be used to investigate the structures of chiral
nanoparticles and biomolecules, thereby supporting ongoing research and educational programs in the
biomedical fields at UMass Dartmouth. These efforts align with the university's long-term goal of advancing
biomedical research and developing therapeutic methods for the treatment of human diseases.
We urgently require this instrument as it will be the only CD spectropolarimeter at UMass Dartmouth and in
Southern Massachusetts. Currently, faculty members who rely on the CD spectropolarimeter in their research
send samples to an external company and pay a usage fee of $100 per sample. The absence of this
instrument hampers the progress of biomedical research and impedes the development of educational
programs at UMass Dartmouth. The CD spectropolarimeter not only supports the research efforts of major
users but also promotes collaborations among faculty members in the Departments of Chemistry and
Biochemistry, Biology, and Bioengineering. Furthermore, several undergraduate and graduate lab courses will
benefit from this instrument by incorporating new labs, as the CD spectropolarimeter is currently inaccessible
to users on our campus. Moreover, if funded, it will provide research and education opportunities for local
universities and community colleges in Southern Massachusetts, as it will be the only CD spectropolarimeter
available in this region. Broad access to this instrument is expected, with users from UMass Dartmouth, local
academic institutes, and industry partners. We anticipate significant benefits from this NIH instrument grant."
10883247,"Abstract: The CD8 T-cell response to cancer is critical for disease control and response to checkpoint inhibitors.
A prevailing feature of all human cancer is the extreme variability of the magnitude of this response between
patients, and the factors that cause this variability are unknown. We previously reported that a critical component
of the tumor microenvironment in many cancer types is an immune niche that provides support for a CD8 T-cell
with stem-like qualities. This niche is a small area of antigen presenting cells localized with the tumor boarder
where TCF1+ stem-like CD8 T-cells reside. These TCF1+ CD8 T-cells are specific for tumor antigens and act
as a progenitor to continuously give rise to anti-tumor effector CD8 T-cells. Most importantly, if the niche is not
present in the tumor, these TCF1+ cells have nowhere to survive in the tumor microenvironment, and
consequently the CD8 response against the cancer is halted. Loss of this immune niche in kidney tumors is
associated with rapid progression of disease after surgery, and significantly worse response to immunotherapy.
In this proposal, we aim to investigate what genetic features cancer cells acquire that help them limit the
formation of the immune niche in tumors. To do this we have developed a novel method that allows sorting of
pure cancer cells from human RCC tumors. We performed RNAseq on cancer cells isolated from 99 T3 clear
cell RCC patients and found two very strong correlates of immune response to the cancers that will be
investigated further here. Firstly, cancer cells with active cell death and NFkB pathways had highly active antigen
presenting cells, bigger immune niches, and many more effector cells. Secondly, cancer cells with high levels of
oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis were far less able to generate effectors from the stem-like cells in their
tumor, immune niches were far smaller and patients progressed more rapidly after surgery and did not respond
to later PD1 blockade. This proposal will expand upon these findings by completing the following aims.
Aim 1 will first study what genetic changes occur in cancer cells that correlate with transcriptional signaling, and
how heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment might differ across regions of the primary tumor and
metastasis. In Aim 2, we present data that cold tumors have mutations in cell death pathways and we will
investigate how loss of particular inflammatory cell death pathways might limit antigen presenting cell activation
and CD8 effector generation in the TME using both PDX and syngeneic mouse models. Aim 3 will learn how
different energy metabolism systems in cancer cells influence the formation of immune niches and regulate CD8
effector differentiation in the TME. Together, these data will provide new insight into how cancer cells limit the
immune response against a tumor.
While much of this work will focus on kidney cancer, the mechanism we described were also found in prostate,
bladder, brain, and head and neck tumors. For this reason, the basic mechanisms that we describe in this work
will almost certainly have implications for understanding the CD8 T-cell response to many other cancers."
10883298,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, affecting nearly one million
people in the United States as of 2020. The core etiopathology comprises intracellular accumulation of Lewy
body-like α-synuclein (α-syn), followed by progressive loss of motor-controlling midbrain dopaminergic (mDA)
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. There is growing evidence that the dysfunction of the cerebral
vasculature called the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in PD progression and, more importantly, implicated
in altered drug efficacy. PD patients suffer from a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes such as movement
disorders/parkinsonism, dementia, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Current standards-of-care are
not curative and focus on symptom management. Thus, a treatment option that can modify the disease pathology
is sorely needed. One of the major challenges in developing such a therapy is the absence of an experimental
model recapitulating human PD pathology, which is needed for quick and reliable screening of candidate
therapies prior to clinical evaluation. Even though recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC) technology makes it possible to derive mDA neurons of PD patients, current 2D culture models do not
recapitulate the native microenvironment around the neurovascular unit and thus cannot model the
pathophysiology of late-onset human PD, which is induced by accumulated aberrant α-syn aggregation. To this
end, we will develop and validate an advanced high-throughput in vitro human PD model that reflects pathological
vascular and tissue changes observed in the brains of PD patients. Specifically, we will engineer and optimize a
multi-well microfluidic tissue on-a-chip platform integrated with vascular perfusion and a blue light module to
reconstruct the complex microenvironment at the interface of the human neurovascular unit and parenchyma
tissue in human brains (Aim 1). We will then induce the core etiopathology of brain-borne α-syn aggregation in
the PD patient-derived mDA neurons using our novel light-inducible pathogenic protein aggregation system (i.e.,
optogenetics-assisted alpha-synuclein aggregation induction system, OASIS) and α-syn preformed fibrils (Aim
2.1). In parallel, we will investigate the effect of blood-borne pathogenic α-syn aggregates, observed in patients,
on PD progression in our model (Aim 2.2). We will validate our newly engineered human PD model by its
comparison to clinical observations, including α-syn accumulation, neuroinflammation, progressive neuronal
death, and pathological changes of the BBB. Finally, we will demonstrate that our PD model can serve as a
testbed to evaluate the delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy of highly versatile drug-loaded delivery
platforms (i.e., human ferritin nanocages) (Aim 3). If successful, the developed platform will ultimately allow us
to build patient-specific disease models instrumental to the development of personalized medicines to treat PD
patients."

TDP has emerged as an important and common age-related pathology related to the Alzheimer’s clinical
syndrome. TDP pathology is found in large number of older brains and is strongly and independently related to
episodic memory impairment. TDP pathology occurs in “normal aging,” with and without concomitant
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, and as a primary component hippocampal sclerosis (HS). The clinical
syndrome associated with TDP pathology mimics and worsens the Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome. TDP (with
and without HS) pathology commonly occurs with AD as mixed pathology and lowers the threshold for
dementia (lowers resilience). TDP also occurs in the absence of a pathologic diagnosis of AD and therein is
separately associated with memory loss and a dementia that mimics AD. Emerging data suggest that TDP
pathology has a large public health impact. Yet, there remain many gaps in our knowledge regarding TDP and
related neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. To advance the field requires better defining the TDP
pathology of aging syndrome with currently available tools. The hippocampus is vulnerable in most age-related
dementias, but little is known about the specific role for TDP pathology in hippocampal degeneration and
memory loss in aging. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the morphologic and neurobehavioral
phenotype of TDP pathology. The hypothesis is that TDP has a unique profile of hippocampal degeneration
and associated cognitive and behavioral deficits that can be separated from AD and vascular pathologies. We
capitalize on a rich large resource of older persons from well characterized and longitudinally followed older
community dwelling subjects enrolled without dementia with high follow-up and autopsy rates. In the first aim
we investigate brains to study the association of TDP pathology with neurons, astrocyte and microglial
densities in multiple regions of hippocampus; and perform a broader search for HS which is patchy and under-
recognized. In the second aim we use ex-vivo MRI imaging to link hippocampal size and shape to TDP after
controlling for AD and vascular pathologies. In the third aim we create a hippocampal shape/size imaging
score for TDP and translate this score from ex-vivo to in-vivo and pathologically validate the marker in those
with in-vivo scans that die and come to autopsy. In the fourth aim we investigate the early neurobehavioral and
cognitive characteristics of TDP pathology. Finally, in aim 5a we investigate the mechanism by which TDP is
associated with memory decline using the new data on neurons, glia, and HS. In 5b we investigate whether the
in-vivo TDP imaging score is associated with memory decline and incident Alzheimer’s type dementia. These
studies on TDP pathology in aging will advance the field and have a strong potential to enhance and our
understanding and the diagnosis of TDP in the spectrum of Alzheimer’s type clinical syndrome."

This is an application to support a successful training program for students admitted to the UCSF
Neuroscience Graduate Program. The program, which dates back to 1977, is designed to provide a highly
rigorous training in both the theory and practice of experimental neuroscience, statistical methodologies,
quantitative skills development, data analysis and management, and scientific communication.
Accomplishing this mission requires an organizational framework dedicated to addressing the challenges
inherent in modern neuroscience training. To this end, we have recently overhauled our training program to
adapt to our rapidly evolving field. The first year curriculum is devoted to a core course focused on the
fundamentals of modern neuroscience, followed by a course in the responsible conduct of science. In addition,
students perform 3 laboratory rotations and meet regularly with their graduate advisor to discuss career goals,
culminating with entry into a thesis lab at the end of the first year. In year two, students begin their research,
take advanced courses, including courses covering scientific writing, experimental design, and data analysis.
They also prepare for qualifying examinations. Years three and beyond are focused on developing, conducting,
completing, and publishing an independent research project in their thesis laboratory. Students meet 2 times a
year with their thesis committee and determine, along with their PI, when enough progress has been made to
graduate. Students then prepare and submit a written thesis and give a public exit seminar with all committee
members present, with the PhD degree being granted upon the unanimous approval of the thesis committee.
The Neuroscience Program currently has 62 training faculty across 14 departments, centers, and affiliated
institutes. Program membership is periodically reviewed, and is restricted to faculty who commit to mentorship
and teaching, participate in program activities, and maintain a rigorous research program. Virtually all areas of
neuroscience are encompassed by the research interests of our faculty. The trainees attend a weekly
seminar series and weekly student-faculty research-in-progress seminars, as well as an annual program
retreat. In the past, the T32 training grant has been the single most important pillar underlying our program’s
success over the past 40 years; it was used to support students during their first and second years of study
before they have advanced to candidacy and initiated full-time Ph.D. thesis research. We enroll
approximately 15-18 students per year, of whom approximately half would be supported by this training grant
during their first two years. Our primary objective is to train a diverse student body in the concepts and
methods of modern neuroscience by imparting the skills, knowledge, and leadership skills needed to succeed
across a range of neuroscience-related careers. NIH support is essential for us to continue to provide
graduate students with the education they will need to become future leaders in their field."

 Sex steroids and chromosomes both contribute to the sexual dimorphism in CVD.
Vascular oxidative stress is one mechanism that is elevated in men compared with women due
to the protective effects of estrogen. While the impact of sex hormones is extensively studied,
sex chromosomes complementation has been overlooked in the context of CVD. Female sex
chromosomes (XX) are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes during hypertension,
stroke, and pulmonary hypertension. Remarkably, studies on the role of sex chromosomes in
vascular oxidative stress are still lacking. Therefore, we have proposed to elucidate the role of
sex chromosomes in vascular oxidative stress associated with CVD. In the K99 phase, our first
aim will establish that in the absence of sex hormones, XX promotes vascular ROS and arterial
stiffening. This aim will unequivocally determine the impact of sex chromosomes on arterial
stiffness and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. We will use the four core genotype (FCG)
mice which includes females with ovaries and testes and males with testes and ovaries. We will
also use state-of-the-art equipment such as high resolution ultrasound for pulse wave velocity,
biaxial pressure myography for arterial biomechanics, and electron spin spectroscopy for
assessing reactive oxygen species. The second aim will elucidate the molecular mechanisms
by which estrogen preserves X chromosome inactivation to suppress X-linked gene expression
and vascular oxidative stress. We will use fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize X-inactive
specific transcript and map the dynamic structure and localization of the sex chromosomes. Our
overall goal is to determine whether sex hormones and chromosomes interact in CVD and are
associated with vascular oxidative stress. In the future, identifying X-linked genes that contribute
to oxidative stress will provide novel targets for sex-specific therapies to treat or prevent CVD.
In the R00 phase, the third, fourth and fifth aims will determine whether estrogen mediated Xist
RNA localization impacts telomere length, mitochondrial oxidative stress and T-cell mediated
vascular damage. The MOSAIC K99/R00 award will enable my training and career development
in novel techniques that will allow separation from my mentor and transition to independency.
Moreover, this proposal will not only progress scientific research in CVD, but advance the
training and fellowship of future minority scientists in biomedical sciences"
10885009,"In response to the specific FOA that explicitly focuses on microbial-based cancer therapy (Bugs as Drugs), we
propose to develop reliable multimodal MRI guidance to improve the efficacy and safety of bacterial cancer
therapies for treating poorly vascularized, hypoxic tumors, where conventional cancer therapies are inadequate.
Even though some have managed to reach clinical trial status, the development of microbial-based therapeutics
for solid tumors has been long hindered by inconsistent results. Researchers in the field of microbial-based
therapeutics have a major problem of inadequate and inconsistent means of guiding, monitoring, and assessing
results of administered microbial therapy. Currently, the patient recruitment criteria for bacterial therapy are not
specific and suitability is mainly judged by tumor size. The surrogate markers for bacterial germination/infection
are radiological signs of tumor destruction and/or clinical signs and symptoms of systemic infection. There is an
urgent need for developing noninvasive imaging tools that can identify patients who likely respond (stratification)
by tumor hypoxia and real-time, quantitively measure the germination and proliferation of therapeutic bacteria in
target tumors. To address these unmet needs, we will develop and optimize two emerging imaging technologies
in this study: a) bacteria-detecting Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI method (namely
bacCEST) to assess bacterial infection in the tumor, serving as a non-invasive means to monitor therapeutic
effects and adjust the treatment plan, and b) Oxygen-Enhanced (OE) MRI to characterize tumor hypoxia and
hence predict the tumors’ vulnerability to anaerobic bacteria. We hypothesize that that the efficacy and safety of
bacterial treatment can be significantly improved using non-invasive, multimodal MRI methods that can
characterize tumor hypoxia prior to treatment and monitor bacterial infection at early time points. We have strong
preliminary data demonstrating the efficacy of C. novyi-NT and capabilities of advanced MRI technologies, and
gathered a multidisciplinary team of oncologists and imaging experts to complete the following aims: 1) Establish
bacteria-detecting bacCEST MRI as a surrogate marker for C. novyi-NT treatment, 2) Establish hypoxia-
detecting OE MRI to stratify tumors and guide bacterial treatment, and 3) Establish multimodal MRI guidance to
improve the efficacy and safety of bacterial cancer therapy. Successful completion of the proposed study will
provide approaches for multimodal MRI guidance that can ultimately improve the success rate of cancer
therapies using anaerobic bacteria, including but not limited to C. novyi-NT. This MRI platform technology, once
translated to human scanners, will address an unmet need in bacterial treatment and can accelerate the
development and clinical testing of bacterial therapies. It will also benefit other areas in medicine (e.g., infection
medicine/sepsis), thereby pushing clinical capabilities forward."
10885010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease remains the number one cause of death in the United States. The efficient development
of future novel diagnostics and therapies to identify and treat cardiovascular disease will require highly
collaborative and multi-disciplinary teams consisting of the best basic, translational and clinical investigators. To
achieve this overarching goal, it will first be essential for cardiovascular researchers to possess multi-disciplinary
skills and work in highly inter-disciplinary, collaborative and translational teams to efficiently move knowledge
from the bench to the bedside, to the community and back. Second, to obtain optimal productivity towards
improving cardiovascular health of the population, it is essential to utilize the contributions from the best of the
entire scientific workforce. We have established a Training Program addressing these two unmet needs that will
ultimately be required to optimally train and retain the next generation of the best cardiovascular investigators.
The goals of this Training Program are:
1. To provide multi-faceted cardiovascular research training to work in collaborative, multidisciplinary teams
 that will facilitate efficient translation of scientific findings to improve human health.
2. To enhance the numbers of outstanding researchers and leaders by providing training for the advancement
 of women to all trainees, improving the culture for women to succeed, and promoting the retention of women
 in independent scientific careers in cardiovascular research.
In addition to advanced Cardiac Physiology and Biostatistics coursework, Rigor and Reproducibility, and
Responsible Conduct of Research Training, several innovative Program Activities were implemented in the first
funding cycle to achieve these goals. Leadership Skills and Advancement of Women workshops supply both
men and women with key professional development and leadership skills at the predoctoral level to improve the
career trajectory of women and change the culture for women to succeed to retain the best scientific investigators
at later career stages. These workshops also provide valuable networking opportunities for trainees with
prominent visiting cardiovascular scientists. The Clinical Mentorship program allows trainees to learn the
language and culture within clinical medicine and to develop the skills needed to form future collaborations with
physicians. Molecular and Cellular Cardiophysiology research-in-progress presentations are highly interactive
and improve both the research and presentation skills of the trainees as well as emphasize rigor and
reproducibility. In this renewal, we will continue to expand upon these programs by also including Career
Mentorship to meet the individualized career goals of trainees. At The Ohio State University, we have a highly
collaborative and multi-disciplinary scientific infrastructure that has been created to support translational
cardiovascular research, education, and training. The mentors on this T32 application are all established
scientists in their field, have a passion for training, and are committed to the goals of this Training program."

 This NIA career development award will establish Dr. McGarry, an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Medicine at the University of Rochester (UR), as an independent investigator with expertise in the areas of cognitive
aging, including Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), and consumer choice in the Medicare program.
 With support from the award, Dr. McGarry will undertake a training plan that focuses on: 1) the clinical trajectory of
ADRD, 2) ADRD family caregiving and research, 3) qualitative research methods, and 4) leadership of a
multidisciplinary research team. This training will enable Dr. McGarry to conduct multidisciplinary, mixed-methods
research examining the impact of ADRD on Medicare choices and resultant outcomes. It builds off his current areas of
expertise, including Medicare policy and benefit design and quantitative health services research. Dr. McGarry has
leveraged the considerable resources available at UR to assemble a multidisciplinary team of nationally-recognized
experts. Dr. Kathi Heffner, the primary career development mentor, is a social psychologist with expertise in cognitive
aging and the study of caregivers with ADRD. Dr. Helena Temkin-Greener, the primary methods mentor, is a health
services researcher with expertise in the delivery and quality of health services for older adults and mixed methods
research. Together they will lead a mentorship team with additional expertise in qualitative research methods, the
measurement of functional cognitive abilities, the diagnosis and clinical care of individuals with ADRD, and the use of
national survey data linked with Medicare claims to study health outcomes in older adults.
 The Medicare program depends on consumer choice, yet little is known about the ability of older adults with
ADRD to navigate this complexity. Available evidence suggests this population is at increased risk of suboptimal
coverage choices, yet little is known about how these risks evolve over the disease course and their health and
financial effects. This mixed-methods study will examine the Medicare coverage choices of individuals with ADRD
throughout the disease course (Aim 1). The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) linked with Medicare claims will be
used to describe the Medicare coverage, and propensity to make changes, of individuals with ADRD at various stages
of cognitive decline. Analyses will also examine whether the impacts of cognitive declines are moderated by the
availability of family caregivers and socioeconomic resources. Qualitative interviews with caregivers of individuals with
ADRD will add depth and support the interpretation of the quantitative results. Using the same HRS data, the effects
of impaired household Medicare decision making due to ADRD on health and financial outcomes will be estimated
using a quasi-experimental design (Aim 2). Study results will provide critical information to policy makers about the
effects of Medicare program design on the well-being of individuals with ADRD. In combination with mentored training,
this research will form the basis of an R01 proposal that will evaluate the effects of potential policy reforms designed to
support Medicare choices in households with ADRD and the acceptability of such reforms to this population."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in African Americans (AA) is likely to progress towards
complicated disease and debilitating outcomes. These outcomes are likely rooted in genetic,
epigenetic, microbial, and metabolic factors. We have made substantial advances in this research
area, and over the past two funding cycles as Ancillary contributors to the IBD-GC produced
sufficient outcomes to drive new studies, and here propose a focused set of three aims building
on those advances. (1) Differences in allele frequency and effect size substantially impact
polygenic risk assessment, (2) Gene expression in the ileum of AA IBD patients tends to display
significant up-regulation of markers associated with adverse disease progression, including TNF
response. (3) Genomic DNA methylation patterns in the rectum of IBD patients is maintained,
reflecting the dominance of epithelial contributions over transient inflammatory signatures from
the immune compartment. (4) AA tend to have a reduced mucosal fibroblast component relative
to European cases. (5) Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for IBD are substantially modified by diet,
smoking and alcohol consumption, but these factors have not been evaluated in AA despite
substantial cultural differences. (6) IBD is associated with changes in the gut microbiome and
differs by ethnicity and urban/rural lifestyle, suggesting a butyrate-induced modulation of epithelial
and immune function. (7) We can experimentally evaluate the impact of genetic and metabolic
perturbations on cellular function using patient biopsy derived organoids. Taken together, these
insights have led to the overarching hypothesis that environmental factors modulate the
epigenome and microbiome, driving adverse health disparity in AA with IBD. To test this, we
propose the following three Specific Aims. For Aim 1, we will define the genetic architecture of
IBD in AA by expanding the IBD-GC sampling, developing an inception cohort, and evaluating
PRS×Environment interactions. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that a subset of ileo-colonic
methylation signatures are consistent with a role in IBD onset and/or severity, rather than an
outcome of IBD, and determine whether these signatures are independent of, or interacting with,
the environmental factors of Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use ileo-colonic biopsies and enteroid
cultures to test the hypothesis that differences in the microbiome drive metabolic profiles that
associate with gut dysbiosis in IBD. Together, our multi-omic approach and breadth of expertise
across multiple disciplines will shed new light on disease outcomes of IBD related to differences
in the genomics and metabolomics of AA ancestries."

Efficient yet effective models for delivering genetic counseling and testing are sorely needed to meet
increasing demands for timely genetic risk information. Traditional germline genetic testing models, which
include in-depth genetic counseling both before and after testing, are time intensive and place substantial
demands on the limited genetic counselor workforce. A “mainstreaming” model, which allows for non-genetics
healthcare providers to order genetic testing without pre-test genetic counseling, with support from genetic
counselors at the time of result disclosure, has shown promise. Yet, past evaluations of mainstreaming models
have been hampered by serious limitations: Studies were restricted to the context of BRCA1/2 testing and do
not reflect the growing use of multigene panel testing (MGPT); rarely used rigorous experimental study designs
or evaluated theoretically-relevant decision-making, psychosocial, and communication outcomes; have not
capitalized on opportunities to improve post-test clinical and familial communication; and neither included nor
addressed informational needs of minority and medically underserved patients. We overcome these limitations
with the proposed study, the objective of which is to develop, test, and evaluate a linguistically and culturally
appropriate mainstreaming (LCAM) model for hereditary cancer MGPT among cancer patients diverse in
race/ethnicity, language, and education. We will first use formative research methods, including transcreation
and cognitive interviewing, to adapt existing pre-test educational materials and post-test clinical communication
materials for use among the diverse population treated at our community hospital partnering sites (Kings
County Hospital Center, Queens Cancer Center). Next, we will conduct an RCT involving English, Haitian
Creole, or Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer (N=500).
Patients will be randomized to obtain access to cancer MGPT through either: i) standard-of-care wherein in-
depth pre-test and post-test genetic counseling are provided via telegenetics (i.e., videoconferencing delivered
at the site clinic) with standard post-test clinical communication materials, or ii) LCAM intervention wherein
patients receive the adapted pre-test educational materials with testing ordered by their oncologist, followed by
post-test genetic counseling provided via telephone with adapted clinical communication materials. Patients
will complete assessments of decision-making, psychosocial, and behavioral outcomes at baseline, upon
deciding whether to have MGPT, and at 1-week and 6-months following receipt of their test results. Long-term
engagement among patients who receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result will also be explored
one year after result receipt through uptake of an offer to discuss any changes in cancer risk or variant
reclassification and an additional assessment. This research has the potential to transform genetic counseling
and testing practice by promoting effective risk communication, decision making, and more equitable delivery
of genomic medicine to those at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes."
10885076,"Project Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive pulmonary disorder with no known cure and poorly
understood pathogenesis. IPF results in significant reductions in quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations and is
fatal. We and others have shown that pulmonary immunity is dysregulated in IPF. The bacteria and host
environment of the human gut - the gut microbiome - has a profound impact on human immunity. The gut
microbiome is a key regulator of pulmonary immunity, a consistent biological observation across several
experimental models. In a key finding, recently published, we have shown that germ free (GF) mice –
experimental mice devoid of a microbiome – are protected from pulmonary fibrosis related mortality. In human
patients with IPF, the bacterial burden of the lung predicts mortality and the lungs bacterial diversity correlates
with pulmonary inflammation. While the microbiome predicts outcomes, key regulatory interactions between
the host, lung and gut microbiota remain unknown.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that key gut microbiota, namely Bifidobacterium spp, act as master
regulators of pulmonary immunity in lung fibrosis, shaping host defense, associated inflammation and
modifying parenchymal repair after lung injury. The rationale for this proposal is that this work will augment our
current knowledge of IPF pathogenesis and further the foundational basis for microbiome based therapies in
chronic lung disease. We will accomplish this through the following experimental aims:
Specific Aim 1: To determine key Bifidobacteria by-products and metabolites that contribute to outcomes in
pre-clinical models of pulmonary fibrosis using pre-biotic diet modifications, germ free (GF) and gnotobiotic
mice, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, functional metagenomics and metabolomics.
Specific Aim 2: To determine the host related cellular and molecular mechanisms through which
Bifidobacterium spp modify outcomes in pulmonary fibrosis using pre-clinical models of pulmonary fibrosis in
conventional and GF derived T cell, IL-10 and IL-17 transgenic models, T cell adoptive transfer and multicolor
flow cytometry mediated characterization of lung cellular immunity.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the immunogenic and fibrogenic effects of gut microbiota from patients with IPF.
Gut microbiota from patients with IPF will be identified and correlated with disease severity and clinical
outcomes. Regulatory T cell phenotype from patients with IPF will be correlated with gut diversity and taxa.
This translational approach will use advanced mechanistic tools to 1) improve our understanding of complex
immune-microbiota interactions that occur in pre-clinical models of lung fibrosis, 2) identify modifiable host and
microbiota related targets in lung fibrosis and finally 3) advance the foundation for microbiome based therapies
in chronic lung disease."
10885077,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Generation of high affinity antibodies in germinal centers (GCs) is a critical step in a wide variety of clinically
relevant processes, from protection against pathogens by prior infection or vaccination to the development of
allergies and autoimmune diseases. Antibody affinity maturation follows a prototypical Darwinian framework, in
which GC B cells introduce random mutations into the antigen-binding portions of their immunoglobulin (Ig)
genes, generating variations in affinity within their progeny. Rare B cells that acquire affinity-increasing mutation
are then selectively expanded within the GC population, thus increasing the average affinity of GC B cells as a
whole, in a process we refer to as positive selection.
Despite decades of work, the precise cellular mechanisms of positive selection—in other words, how GCs “pick
out” B cells with the highest affinity—remains a topic of debate. More than 10 years ago, we provided the first in
vivo evidence in mice for a role for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells as arbiters of this selective process. In our model,
Tfh cells would sense how much peptide a B cell could present on its surface (which in turn depended on the B
cell’s affinity), providing help selectively to the highest-affinity B cells. However, despite accumulating functional
evidence for this model, selective delivery of T cell help to B cells based on their affinity has never been directly
demonstrated in physiological settings. To achieve this, we developed LIPSTIC, a method that allows us to
directly record T cell help to B cells with great precision in vivo. In Aim 1 of this project, we propose to use
LIPSTIC as a means to directly test the T cell help model in classic hapten-carrier induced GC selection models.
In Aim 2, we will follow up on this by testing our findings from mouse LIPSTIC in human vaccine-induced GCs.
In Aim 3, we use the original LIPSTIC in conjunction with two novel versions on this strategy to investigate the
dynamics of multi-antigen driven selection in influenza-induced GCs."

Generating synapse-resolution maps or connectomes of the brain are crucial to understanding the neural basis
of behavior, and can provide key insights into the onset, progression, and treatment of neurological disease and
injury. Towards this goal, major advances in electron microscopy imaging and automated image segmentation
have enabled researchers to produce millimeter-scale connectomic datasets, and forge a path towards an even
larger whole mouse brain volume. Despite the high quality of automated segmentation at this scale, the
enormous extent of axon and dendrite “wiring” in the brain unavoidably leads to errors in neuronal connectivity
that require correction with post-hoc proofreading. Although a variety of approaches have been developed to
enable faster manual proofreading, the number of human hours needed to correct errors are prohibitive, and
prevent us from realizing the full potential of valuable datasets such as the cubic millimeter MICrONS (mouse
cortex) and H01 (human cortex) volumes. To enable even larger connectomes, we must develop cost-effective
and time-saving automated methods to replace labor-intensive human proofreading where possible and allow
human resources to focus on other connectomic tasks that include generating training data and validating
automated correction. The goal of this proposal is to build capabilities for scalable automated proofreading,
leveraging and extending software tools built during our previous IARPA MICrONS activities: NEURD (short for
NEURal Decomposition), an automated error detection and correction framework built by Baylor College of
Medicine, and NeuVue, a scalable manual proofreading platform built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory. Both tools are deeply integrated and complementary to the existing ecosystem of open-
source connectomics tools and resources from the community such as Neuroglancer, PyChunkedGraph (PCG),
and Connectomics Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE). Building on the foundation of these tools and our
existing collaboration, we will add capabilities for machine learning enabled error detection of a wider range of
error types including both merge and split errors. We will implement an active learning approach that focuses
valuable human validation effort on the most informative error examples, with the goal of statistically validating
entire classes of edits that can be applied in automated batches to the segmentation. Finally, we will develop a
workflow for applying these automated edits to the segmentation in an optimized way that also does not conflict
with existing manual proofreading and retains a confidence metric for each edit that can be used for downstream
analysis. The successful completion of this project, “Connects-Proof: A Scalable Automated Proofreading
Framework for Connectomics” will yield a mature workflow that is validated across multiple data sets and that
can support existing and future work in the BRAIN-CONNECTS program."
10883979,"Describing the Emotional Environment of the Infant, from 6 to 17 Months
Understanding and recognizing emotions is critical for children’s social interactions, enabling them to
appropriately respond to others’ needs, make predictions about social interactions, and even regulate their own
emotional responses. Importantly, we currently know very little about infants’ natural exposure to emotion
information, limiting our subsequent understanding of how infants develop emotion categories, how they learn
to use emotion information to guide action and build expectations about social interactions, and how specific
experiences or individual differences shape development in these domains. Here, we will take the first step in
addressing this issue by using three existing datasets of infants interacting with their caregivers at home and in
the lab to characterize their real-world experience with emotion information across the first year and a half of
life. First, we will describe infants’ exposure to emotion information by coding video segments with facial
information for emotional expressions, as well as assess the degree of variation in these facial movements. We
will then describe exposure to emotion language using transcriptions to identify the emotion labels most often
used by caregivers. Using the coded video data, we will then examine how emotion language and facial
information appear jointly in the infant’s social environment. Finally, we will examine two concurrent domains—
motor development and language development—as potential transitions for developmental change in exposure
to emotion information, by using monthly vocabulary/gesture checklists and motor questionnaires available
with one of the datasets. Altogether, the proposed work will provide a foundation for a new and potentially
transformative approach to studying the development of emotion understanding. Further, by characterizing the
emotional input common of typically developing infants, we might gain a better understanding of how atypical
emotional environments, such as those hypothesized to be associated with depressed, anxious, or abusive
parents, might shape maladaptive trajectories of emotional behavior."

Overview: This resubmission describes a 4-year training program in statistical genetics through the study of
genetics of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and choroidal vasculature.
Background: CSC is a disease of the choroid and retina seen commonly by retina specialists, and it causes
progressive vision loss. Patients tend to have a thick and dilated choroid. Evidence suggests that both CSC
and choroidal thickness are heritable, but only a handful of loci have been reported. Discovery of new genetic
associations for CSC can reveal underappreciated pathophysiologic mechanisms. CSC shares some genetic
overlap with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and a better understanding of CSC and choroidal
vasculature genetics is needed. This K23 proposal seeks to identify common genetic variation associated to
CSC and choroidal thickness and to investigate how this variation overlaps with known genetic associations to
AMD.
Training: The proposal is designed to provide foundational training in statistical genetics and automated
optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis for the PI, Dr. Elizabeth Rossin, who will learn these skills
from mentors, collaborators, seminars and training sessions. This training will cover techniques of data
assembly and quality control of biobank data, the approach to genome-wide association study and meta-
analysis, and skills of patient recruitment and prospective genotyping for the clinician-scientist. It will foster
experience in the use of existing OCT and genetic data to develop skills in the application of machine learning
to choroidal measurements on OCT and additional statistical genetics skills for quantitative trait analyses.
Finally, the PI will learn genetic correlation analysis, an area of genetics that is becoming increasingly
important to understand shared biological mechanisms in disease, here applied to CSC and AMD.
Research: Aim 1 proposes to perform a CSC genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis across
biobanks and available data and to replicate findings in a deeply phenotyped cohort of prospectively recruited
patients. Aim 2 proposes to measure a hallmark of CSC – choroidal thickness – on OCT and to perform
quantitative trait GWAS meta-analyses. Finally, Aim 3 investigates the overlap of CSC and AMD genetics
using modern statistical approaches including LD-score regression and colocalization. This proposed research
seeks to identify novel loci for CSC and choroidal thickness and to link this to AMD, which can point to critical
pathways in macular disease.
Summary: Through this K23 mentored training, the PI intends to develop skills that are applicable broadly to a
career in patient-oriented retinal genetics research."

Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain problems increase dramatically in the adolescent years, with wide impact
and high direct and indirect healthcare costs. Unfortunately, adolescents with chronic MSK pain are likely to
become adults with chronic MSK pain, and also suffer from high levels of negative consequences, including
disability, poor quality of life, and poor psychosocial functioning. In the adolescent developmental period, acute
MSK pain complaints (most commonly spine, knee, and foot or ankle pain) account for a large portion of
physician visits, and recent studies estimate that about 30-35% of these youth transition from acute pain to a
chronic pain state. However, mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain states are poorly
understood, particularly in adolescents. While there are a number of known biopsychosocial risk factors for the
development of chronic pain, better mechanistic understanding of transition between acute and chronic pain
states is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics and preventative interventions designed to stop
chronic pain before it becomes disabling and costly. The proposed study will examine both key neurobiological
and biopsychosocial risk factors that contribute to the development of chronic MSK pain in adolescents. To our
knowledge, this would be the first neuroimaging study conducted in a sample of youth presenting for treatment
for acute MSK pain. Capturing treatment-seeking adolescents with MSK pain and following these youth over the
course of the following year, will provide novel information about candidate mechanisms and risk for the transition
from acute to chronic pain states. Using resting state and task-based functional and structural magnetic
resonance imaging, alongside comprehensive self and proxy report measures of biopsychosocial history and
function, we will identify independent multimodal neurobiological components associated with acute MSK pain
and examine associations with theoretically-grounded biopsychosocial risk pathways for chronic pain in the
context of a host of environmental factors. We will then prospectively examine how these neurobiological and
biopsychosocial risk pathways (pain processing, mood, and pain related cognition) are related to pain
persistence and pain-related impact over time using parallel process latent growth curve modeling, as well as
retrospectively identify additional
state)
neurobiological phenotypes (beyond those associated with the acute MSK pain
 that differentiate individuals demonstrating pain persistence from those with symptom remission.
Participants will include adolescents, ages 11-17, with n=200 acute MSK pain and a sample of n=80 age- and
sex-matched pain-free controls, as well as a participating parent. These adolescents will be followed an
additional three times (every 3 months over a 1 year period) to examine pain persistence and pain-related
impacts over time. Determining mechanisms and moderators of risk during this developmental transition will
provide critical information for interventions aimed at reducing risk for chronic pain in youth."

risky sexual behavior, access to health care, women’s empowerment, intimate partner violence, water and
sanitation, and the impact of armed conflict on reproductive choices. The proposed innovations to and expansion
of the database in the next phase will exponentially increase the potential research topics enabled by IPUMS
DHS. The continuation project has five specific aims: Aim 1. Achieve global coverage. IPUMS DHS now
incorporates microdata from 170 DHS surveys from 41 African and Asian countries, but it does not yet cover
Latin America, the Caribbean, Central and East Asia, Eastern Europe, or Oceania. The next phase will add
survey series from new regions, while also adding the latest surveys from Africa and South Asia. Aim 2. Unlock
comparative research across IPUMS global health databases. IPUMS DHS will become even more powerful
in the next phase when the database is made interoperable with other global health data series, such as
UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). When coupled with data from MICS, almost 90 percent of
DHS countries will have three or more samples to compare across time, and 98 percent will have data from the
21st century. Aim 3. Enable cutting-edge research on the impact of social and environmental context on
health. The third project phase will triple the number of social and environmental context variables in IPUMS
DHS. With these new data, researchers will conduct path-breaking research, such as global comparisons of the
impact of rising sea levels on the health of individuals in communities near coastlines. Aim 4. Expedite data
analysis by simplifying or eliminating researchers’ data management tasks. Proposed enhancements will
enable users to filter samples based on topical content, variable availability, and country characteristics. We will
also develop an Application Programming Interface (API), allowing users to automate the tasks of defining and
executing data extracts. Aim 5. Support and expand our user community. IPUMS DHS is committed to
democratizing access to population data. The project will continue to provide robust individualized user support,
webinars, and workshops at key conferences, while introducing online tutorials and code-sharing opportunities."
10886299,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) remains the only curative therapy for many
aggressive malignancies and is increasingly used for non-malignant disorders. Success is limited by 1) relapse
due to insufficient graft-vs-tumor (GVT) activity and 2) graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Current GVHD therapies
predispose to infection and relapse. Understanding the mechanisms that optimize GVT activity and mitigate
GVHD remains a critical unmet need. Donor T-cells are essential to the allogeneic immune response. De novo
DNA methylation by DNMT3a allows activated T-cells to acquire patterns of gene expression that define
alloreactivity. Human donor DNMT3a mutations result in decreased relapse, increased GVHD, and improved
survival in HCT recipients. Based on a large body of preliminary data, both GVHD and GVT activity significantly
depend upon DNA methylation, the role of which is largely unknown in the HCT context. I hypothesize that
targeting epigenetically controlled pathways can skew allogeneic immunity away from host and towards tumor.
Design: Mice with cell-lineage specific DNMT3a deletion will be used as donors in well-established, clinically
relevant, murine models of HCT. Following HCT, donor cells will be isolated from recipient mice and undergo
whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in parallel. This novel approach,
proven to be feasible and successful in my preliminary work, produces a comprehensive epigenetic and
transcriptomic profile of the cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of GVHD and the GVT effect. Importantly,
this method readily identifies the pathways that are dysregulated in the absence of DNMT3a.
Aim 1: Target epigenetically regulated pathways to mitigate GVHD. Dnmt3a KO donor T-cells accelerate GVHD.
WGBS and RNAseq post-HCT identified multiple pathways, normally silenced by DNMT3a, that may contribute
to this phenomenon. We will explore these putative novel targets, starting with CCR9, a chemokine receptor that
guides T-cells to the intestine, a major GVHD target organ.
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of myeloid cell DNMT3a deletion to enhanced GVHD and GVT activity.
Myeloid-derived cells hold significant immunoregulatory potential. The impact of myeloid DNMT3a deletion is
unknown. We will use donors with myeloid Dnmt3a deletion to test this.
Aim 3: Identify genes that distinguish beneficial GVT activity from harmful GVHD via epigenetic and
transcriptomic comparative analyses. In GVT models, where allo-HCT is performed in the presence of leukemia,
KO T-cells provide superior disease control. We will apply WGBS and RNAseq to interrogate how the presence
of tumor alters the epigenome and identify the changes that allow KO T-cells to better eradicate leukemia.
My long-term goal is to become an independent laboratory-based clinician-scientist, focusing on complications
of HCT and novel therapeutic approaches. My aims and training plan have been specifically and thoughtfully
crafted to provide me with the research skills and experience needed to reach this goal."

The potential of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in slowing cognitive decline and reducing Alzheimer's
dementia (AD) has been established through observational studies and the PREDIMED Trial. However, current
MedDiet recommendations were developed based on population averages and may not be best suited for a
given individual. Preliminary data from our group and others suggest that the individual response to MedDiet
may depend on the gut microbial profiles. Moreover, the gut microbiome, which communicates with the brain
along the ""gut-brain axis,"" contributes to the development of AD. However, no randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) have examined the efficacy of personalized dietary approaches based on individual gut microbiomes
for AD prevention. Existing human microbiome studies on AD are often limited by cross-sectional designs,
small sample sizes, and a lack of high-resolution microbial profiling and longitudinal assessment of multiple
neuropathological processes. This background supports our central hypotheses that: 1) MedDiet contributes to
cognitive health partly through modulating the gut microbiome, and 2) the effects of MedDiet on cognitive
health vary by individuals’ gut microbial profiles. This project is highly responsive to PAR-22-093’s call for
“precision medicine for AD/ADRD by incorporating dense molecular endophenotyping” (NOT-AG-21-045). Our
proposal represents a highly cost-efficient study that leverages existing fecal and plasma samples, microbiome
data, and cognitive and brain MRI assessments from three well-conducted RCTs, PREDIMED-Plus (n=620),
DIRECT-PLUS (n=294), and MIND (n=604), as well as a prospective cohort study, Study of Latinos (SOL,
n=2,250). To gain deeper mechanistic insights, we will employ a multi-omics approach, combining whole-
genome shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to profile microbial composition and enzymatic
function and fecal and plasma metabolomics to measure the metabolic activity of the gut microbiome. Blood
and MRI imaging biomarkers will also be measured to delineate the multiple neuropathological processes
underlying AD development. We will investigate the roles of gut microbial composition and enzymatic function
in modulating the effects of MedDiet on cognitive changes (Aim 1), examine the interrelationships between
MedDiet, the metabolic activity of the gut microbiome, and cognitive changes (Aim 2), and investigate how
MedDiet-induced alterations in the gut microbiome influence the blood and imaging biomarkers of
neuropathological processes (Aim 3) in PREDIMED-Plus and DIRECT-PLUS. The findings from Aims 1, 2, and
3 will be validated and replicated in the MIND study, and their generalizability will be assessed in SOL. This
project will be the first to prospectively evaluate the role of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in primary AD
prevention in RCTs. It will generate personalized and translatable dietary interventions based on reproducible
biological mechanisms, contributing to the paradigm shift towards precision nutrition in AD prevention."

The core mission of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) has been to serve the
public good by fostering biomedical research through collecting and supplying high quality, well-
characterized human biospecimens to the scientific community. The proof of our success over
the past 36 years is evidenced by the growing bibliography of 5000 publications and 272
published patent applications by the researchers (CHTN investigators) using our service. The
CHTN Eastern Division (ED) has built a dynamic infrastructure and brought the CHTN resource
to over 1000 researchers who otherwise would have lacked access to the tissue essential to
their work. The purpose of this proposal is to report the successes, strengths, and innovations of
the ED at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and to present our plan to continue as an
adult division of the CHTN in the next 5-year cycle. The Specific Aims of the ED were developed
as the operational blueprint for this division to maximize participation in the national CHTN by
leveraging local resources. To this end, our Aims, highly successful to date, refresh and
reinforce our highly unified approach to procedures, informatics, and operations to ensure
procuring and supplying premium quality biospecimens with personalized customer service. The
Specific Aims of the ED will remain consistent in the proposed funding cycle because they
continue to reflect the innovative approach to collection, quality management, and distribution of

10888569,"The overall objective of the proposed study is identification of the potent and selective maxi-K+ channel agonist
that can be developed as a topical drug for the treatment of exfoliation glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is a
multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic
nerve. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is a causative risk factor contributing to the glaucomatous optic
neuropathy. While the majority of glaucoma patients can be effectively managed using current IOP-lowering
medications, the treatment of exfoliation glaucoma (XFG), which accounts for 25% of glaucoma cases,
remains to be a significant challenge. XFG is an aggressive form of the disease which is refractory to current
glaucoma therapies. XFG has large diurnal IOP fluctuations and tends to progress more rapidly carrying worse
prognosis and a higher risk of blindness. Developing a topical drug therapy (eye drops) for the effective diurnal
control of IOP in exfoliation glaucoma addresses a highly significant unmet medical need in ophthalmology.
XFG is caused by the accumulation of extracellular protein aggregates called exfoliation material (XFM) in
ocular tissues. XFM blocks the fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork, elevating IOP. Based on
experimental evidence, it was suggested that an abnormal capacity of the lysosomal-autophagic system for
trafficking and degradation of its cargo underpins the development of XFM aggregates in XFG. Lysosomal
maxi-K+ channels play a pivotal role in regulation of Ca2+ dynamics in the lysosomes. Activation of the
lysosomal maxi-K+ channels seems to be required for the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes and for
degradation of the autophagosomal cargo. Maxi-K+ channel overexpression or its pharmacological activation
with agonists rescues disease phenotypes associated with deficiencies in lysosomal degradation and
trafficking. We hypothesize that pharmacological activation of lysosomal maxi- K+ channels can normalize the
dysfunction in the autophagic-lysosomal system seen in XFG thus limiting the XFM production. While
activation of the lysosomal channels would inhibit the XFM formation, activation of plasma membrane maxi-K+
channels may additionally contribute to IOP reduction in XFG by stimulating ocular fluid outflow. We propose
the development of a topical maxi-K+ agonist that activate both plasma membrane and lysosomal maxi-K+
channels as a treatment for exfoliation glaucoma. A starting compound exemplifying a group of maxi-K+
agonists is proposed for optimization in the current study. We characterized the starting compound in a battery
of established assays and determined its in vitro ADME characteristics. The compound exhibits a micromolar
potency in the primary assay which indicates the need for its additional optimization. The studies outlined in
this proposal seek to conduct SAR optimization and provide evidence of the in vivo efficacy for this new class
of drug candidates (Aim 1) and to explore the novel in vivo biomarker that can facilitate pre-clinical and clinical
development of maxi-K+ agonists as a new class of XFG therapies (Aim 2)."
10888711,"Arkansas Technology and Data Science in Health and medicine (AR Tech-DaSH) is a partnership between the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and high school students and teachers primarily in
northwest (NW) Arkansas. The program targets the underserved and underrepresented population of students
in NW Arkansas and is structured around technology and data science outreach in the classroom and
community as well as statewide virtual classroom outreach and teacher training workshops. The overall
objective is to increase STEM content knowledge and promote more positive beliefs and attitudes towards
STEM and data science with the ultimate goal of promoting a more diverse STEM workforce. The program
revolves around three major health concerns prevalent in the NW Arkansas regional population (i.e.,
cardiovascular, obesity/diabetes, and immunology/cancer). The three specific aims of this project are to: Aim 1.
Increase the interest and knowledge of high school students for STEM related fields and careers with a focus
on data science. The program uses hands on imaging technology and data science analytic experiences to
stimulate student interest in STEM and data science careers. Visits to 9th grade classes at schools in both rural
and urban districts in NW Arkansas will provide students with valuable experience using a variety of medical
related technologies (e.g., stethoscopes, ultrasound, infrared, and computerized tomography (CT) imaging)
and data science focused activities. A ten-day AR Tech-DaSH camp for 25 students each year will provide an
integrated exposure to medical related skills, anatomical basis of disease, clinician-patient simulations,
research and case-based discussions of the three thematic diseases. A major focus of the camp is to provide
students with an exposure to data science skills (exploratory data analysis, data transformation, data mining,
and machine learning) using health or medicine related datasets. The camp includes near peer mentoring by
medical and undergraduate students, and lunch panel discussions with STEM role models. High school level
data science modules will be developed and piloted with select groups of high school students. Aim 2. Increase
STEM and data science knowledge in the community. Students who attend camp will be designated as STEM
Ambassadors and will design and implement outreach events in their school districts with input from the
community stakeholders. The community events will focus on health and medicine and the value of data
science in making important life decisions. Aim 3. Increase student and teacher knowledge of health and
medicine and data science across the state through implementation of a virtual outreach model. Virtual
outreach sessions will be provided to rural classrooms across the state. Virtual teacher training workshops will
show teachers how to incorporate imaging and data science into their classroom curriculum. The successful
implementation of AR Tech-DaSH will serve as a model for using technology and data science to promote
STEM in diverse populations to ensure a future STEM workforce that better reflects the US population."

Our long-term objectives are to define the complex mechanisms responsible for brain damage and repair
following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), as a model for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in
term infants, and to search for novel and specific diagnostic and therapeutic targets for HIE.
Inflammation is a hallmark of HI brain injury, during which brain resident microglia play critical roles in both
induction and resolution of the inflammatory responses. We recently observed a striking buildup of cholesterol-
containing lipid droplets in microglia (lipid-laden microglia) in the injured areas following HI in the neonatal
mice, as well as in human HIE patients. In this proposal, we study how abnormal lipid accumulation and
defective clearance of cholesterol in microglia affect their normal function and neuroinflammation after neonatal
HI. We focus on cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (ch25h), which converts cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol for
clearance, and plays multiple roles in reducing intracellular cholesterol overload. We hypothesized that ch25h
is critical for the maintenance of microglial homeostasis and attenuation of neuroinflammation
following neonatal brain HI. In Aim1, we will assess how ch25h regulates microglial lipid accumulation and
function in HI-injured neonatal brain. We will delete ch25h selectively in microglia and investigate the direct
effects on lipid accumulation in microglia, microglial phagocytic ability, as well as the production of cytokines
and reactive oxygen species. The contribution of microglial ch25h to brain injury are determined at early phase
after HI. In Aim 2, to begin dissecting the mechanisms by which ch25h regulates microglia phenotype after
neonatal HI, we will characterize the transcriptional profiles of microglia with unperturbed or deficient ch25h in
the sham and HI-injured brain using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technology followed by
RNA-sequencing.
This is the first study of the crosstalk between cholesterol metabolism and microglial immunity using a clinically
relevant mouse model of HIE. By addressing this important gap in knowledge in perinatal brain injury, we will
improve our understanding of how lipid regulation/processing in microglia controls their innate immune and
inflammatory responses, and contributes to brain damage/recovery. The results of this study could inform
novel therapeutic opportunities for neonatal brain injury by targeting microglial lipid metabolism."

Non-allergic asthma constitutes about 30% of the adult asthma population and is frequently associated with
severe asthma. Unlike that of allergic asthma the mechanism of non-allergic asthma is poorly understood.
Eosinophilic inflammation is common in non-allergic asthma. Whether environmental factors contribute to the
pathogenesis of eosinophilic inflammation is unclear. We have developed a mouse model of asthma through
repetitive exposure to allergen-associated PAMPs (Pathogen-associated Molecular Patterns). ILCs (innate
lymphoid cells) from this model developed a PAMP-specific memory, which could be elicited with a
subthreshold dose of the PAMP 3-15 weeks later. Based upon extensive preliminary results, we hypothesize
that repetitive exposure to PAMPS leads to the formation of ILC memory, which constitutes two programs—a
gene repression program and a preparedness program. The repression of previously activated genes forms
the genetic basis for memory. This repression prevents host damage in the absence of the PAMPs. The
preparedness program generates a rapid response to a subthreshold PAMP exposure through activation of the
Fhl2-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, which de-represses the previously marked genes and induces asthma (Fig. 1). We
propose 3 specific aims to test this hypothesis. Under Aim 1 we will study allergen- and PAMP-elicited asthma
and memory ILCs in mice and examine cross-reactivity among allergens and PAMPs. We will assess the
importance of ILCs and the pattern recognition receptors in this asthma model. Under aim 2 we will elucidate
the mechanism of formation of ILC memory. We will study the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of
allergen- and PAMP-induced memory ILCs and their persistence over time. The results from scRNA-seq and
ATAC-seq from memory ILCs suggested a role for the repressor Bach2 and the preparedness pathway Fhl2-
ERK1/2-Fosb for memory induction and recall, respectively. We will examine the role of Fhl2, Bach2 and FosB
in a loss-of-function approach. Aim 3 will be devoted to human ILCs studies. We will examine the expression
of the repression and preparedness program genes in human ILCs and study the mechanism of their induction.
We will study the frequency of memory ILCs and their response to allergens and PAMPs in eosinophilic non-
allergic asthmatic patients and establish their clinical correlation. We will employ unbiased and robust genomic
approaches such as RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and utilize innovative mouse models to test the novel concept of
PAMP-elicited ILC memory. We will examine the molecular mechanism of non-allergic eosinophilic asthma,
test therapeutic strategies, and seek to establish human relevance using clinical samples from asthmatic
patients. We have the necessary expertise and tools to conduct the proposed experiments. The proposal will
generate paradigm-shifting new knowledge and intervention strategies that will help treat non-allergic asthma."

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in the United States and although patients initially
respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy, most relapse with chemoresistant disease within 24 months. There are
several critical gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that support disease recurrence but research over the
last decade support the notion tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a subpopulation of drug resistant tumor cells, are
responsible for facilitating relapse and combination therapies targeting these elusive cells may lead to longer
remission or even cures. Although numerous genes and signaling pathways have been implicated in maintaining
TICs, there are several critical gaps in our understanding of the processes these cells use to survive cytotoxic
chemotherapy and successfully re-establish tumors. For example, it is unclear whether pathways active in TICs
are constitutive or if they can be induced by factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our previous studies
revealed an important role for alternative NF-kB signaling in maintaining ovarian TICs and resistance to cytotoxic
chemotherapy. NF-kB is a family of transcription factors that respond to signals in the TME to promote
proliferation, chemoresistance, and survival of cancer cells. Emerging evidence suggest alterations of the TME
following cytotoxic chemotherapy can result in the release of signaling factors that can activate NF-kB in cancer
cells. Our recent data show that TWEAK, a multifunctional cytokine secreted from macrophages and stromal
cells, is elevated in the TME following chemotherapy and can induce activation of alternative NF-kB and
expression of stemness genes in a variety of ovarian cancer cells. Clinical data from patients undergoing
neoadjuvant chemotherapy show that genes encoding TWEAK and alternative NF-kB family members are
significantly elevated in tumors resected following cytotoxic chemotherapy relative to pre-treatment levels. These
data lead us to our central hypothesis that chemotherapy provides an environment that favors TIC development
through activation of alternative NF-kB. To investigate this hypothesis, we will 1) determine whether
chemotherapy-induced TWEAK signaling in the ovarian TME activates alternative NF-kB in ovarian cancer cells
2) establish the function of the alternative NF-kB kinase, NIK, in ovarian cancer chemoresistance and relapse
and 3) investigate the role of NF-kB-mediated activation of Notch in supporting ovarian TICs following
chemotherapy. Unlike most published studies, we are focusing on the pathways and activities in these cells after
chemotherapy, to generate new paradigms for evaluating relapse mechanisms. Given the strong initial response
to chemotherapy, it is of great interest to identify an early post-treatment event that could be targeted in
combination with cytotoxic drugs to inhibit pathways that maintain TICs. Clarifying novel mechanism(s) by which
this under-examined pathway supports chemoresistance will guide the design of better therapies to prolong
remission or potentially achieve cures for ovarian cancer patients."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common group of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), leading to
progressive photoreceptor degeneration and blindness. In addition to well-studied outer retinal dysfunction in
RP, there is a growing body of rigorous work highlighting cellular adaptations in the inner retina, likely due to
neural remodeling following deafferentation. The impact of this structural remodeling on the function of inner
retina, and its consequences for visual function, are at present poorly understood. Electroretinography (ERG)
provides a non-invasive method to assess inner retinal dysfunction both in the clinic and in animal models of
retinitis pigmentosa, providing a means not only to provide insights into these questions, but also to translate
mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic strategies for patients. The long term goal of the candidate is to
become an independent clinician-scientist with the skills necessary to pursue strategies to prevent or restore
vision loss in patients with IRDs. The scientific objective of the current proposal is to test the novel hypothesis,
supported by preliminary data using a novel ERG protocol in both patients and animal models of retinal
degeneration, that retinal remodeling leads to aberrant responses (noise) in inner retinal neurons that mask
responses to a visual stimulus. The overarching goal of the proposal is to provide the candidate with the
mentorship, skills, and support to realize a career dedicated to improve signal transmission in the degenerating
retina. This is an essential area of research, as aberrant inner retinal responses limit the potential for functional
improvement in all therapies that improve photoreceptor function. In Aim 1, the extent of inner-retina
dysfunction will be assessed using novel ERG techniques in human subjects with RP. Aim 2 will develop ERG
approaches to assess inner retinal remodeling in a mouse model of RP (the rd10 mouse model); Aim 3 will
define the functional impact of photoreceptor degeneration in intracellular recordings of retinal ganglion cells in
rd10 mice. This proposal describes a 4-year training program for developing an academic career focused on
understanding retinal dysfunction in IRDs under an outstanding team of multidisciplinary mentors dedicated to
the candidate’s objective of scientific independence. The proposal will leverage the candidate’s research
training in neuroscience and clinical fellowship training in IRDs and vitreoretinal surgery under a mentorship
team that has extensive experience in clinical retinal electrophysiology and psychophysics (Dr. Jason
McAnany), animal electrophysiology and genetics (Dr. Neal Peachey), and single cell electrophysiology and
imaging (Dr. Steve DeVries). Coursework and seminars will complement the mentorship team in the realization
of ethical basic and translational research. The institutional environment in the Department of Ophthalmology &
Visual Sciences at the University of Illinois-Chicago, with its corps of outstanding vision scientists and
outstanding facilities, will maximize the candidate’s success in research and career development."

 The ability to read is fundamental to living in modern society. Loss of reading ability due to stroke, called
alexia, likely affects over a million Americans at any given time and causes difficulty performing many daily life
functions. To improve diagnosis and treatment of alexia, we must understand the neurocognitive basis of
reading deficits after stroke. However, prior small-scale studies using broad diagnostic categories and older
neuroimaging methods have yielded only general lesion-behavior associations in alexia. Here, we propose the
largest study to date of both alexia and typical reading in older adults, using detailed measures of reading
ability and the most advanced multimodal neuroimaging methods available to test a new neurocognitive model.
 Reading relies on brain networks that evolved for speech and language processes, but neurocognitive
models of reading have not yet incorporated recent advances in our understanding of these networks. We
propose a new model of Reading Integrated with Speech and Semantics (RISS) that provides a more specific
neurocognitive architecture for reading than prior models. We hypothesize that lesions of specific RISS
network processors and connections account for specific reading deficit patterns after stroke, and that
restoration of the injured RISS pathways or compensation in uninjured pathways underlie alexia recovery.
 Although brain networks for reading have been extensively mapped in typical and atypical young
populations, stroke tends to occur in the aging brain and in people of low education and socioeconomic status
(SES) who are too often left out of cognitive neuroscience research. Pathological patterns of reading in alexia
are also observed to a lesser degree in typical readers, and age, education and SES are all known to affect
reading abilities. Therefore, alexia can only be fully understood by examining how these factors relate to
reading behavior and the brain in typical older adults, and referencing reading deficits to this personal context.
 In the first study of this project, we will collect an extensive battery of reading and language tests along with
advanced multimodal MRIs in 100 older adults demographically matched to stroke survivors. We will test
hypotheses based on RISS and examine how age, education, and SES relate to both behavior and the brain.
We will freely disseminate all testing materials and both behavioral and imaging data to facilitate further
research in this area. In the second study, we will perform the same behavioral battery in 200 chronic stroke
survivors prospectively selected based on lesion attributes from a new imaging database of thousands of
stroke survivors. We will model the effects of the lesions on processors and connections in RISS and test
brain-behavior hypotheses using lesion-network mapping analyses. In the third study, we will collect detailed
behavioral data and multimodal MRIs in 50 stroke survivors during the subacute period and again 12 months
later to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of alexia recovery based on RISS. This project will substantially
advance our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of reading in both alexia and typical aging."

Home- and community-based services (HCBS) for dementia are essential and growing yet understudied. HCBS are a type
of long-term services and supports that assist with everyday functioning such as eating, dressing, bathing, and meal
preparation. These services facilitate community living, as opposed to institutional living, in line with most consumers’
preferences. Relative to the expeditious movement towards more HCBS, the consideration of affordability, access,
delivery, quality, and outcomes of dementia HCBS are woefully behind. Even more general measures of HCBS (not
relating to dementia) do not consider the unique needs of persons with dementia or their caregivers, and are fragmented by
setting, service, and payer. Additionally, it is nearly impossible to compare measures across U.S. states or even HCBS
populations within a given state due to a lack of coherent, harmonized measures. Relevant quality domains include
structural (e.g., provider capacity), process (e.g., receipt of adequate services), and outcome (e.g., quality of life)
measures. These measures must be developed with considerations for differential measurement issues for populations with
dementia including quality of life and family caregiver metrics that are unique to dementia. The research field is mired by
these challenges and is further exacerbated by the lack of centralized data. To expedite evidence-based measures of HCBS
dementia outcomes that are equity-focused, our Research Network seeks to coordinate activities, grow a diverse bench
bench, and increase the productivity of policy-oriented research to improve the financing, access, delivery, and quality
monitoring of dementia HCBS. We will bring together researchers who work on all forms and settings of HCBS and
include both private pay (e.g., out of pocket) and public benefit (Medicaid) services. Our Network activities are equity-
driven, because of their content focus (ensuring equitable HCBS access, quality, and outcomes) and their focus on
building a larger, more diverse bench of dementia HCBS researchers. Bench-building efforts will span the continuum of
engagement of underrepresented scientists and institutions, from ensuring reach and recruitment, promoting the funding,
research, and publication success, and facilitating the broader dissemination, recognition, and long-term policy impacts.
The ultimate goals of our research network are to (1) foster formal communications and knowledge sharing to quickly
advance innovative dementia HCBS research; (2) grow and diversify the bench of dementia HCBS researchers; (3)
generate data tools to facilitate examination of population and temporal changes in structure, process, and outcome
measures of dementia HCBS; (4) facilitate greater translation of research into dementia HCBS policy changes; and (4)
develop a Network infrastructure and products through a diversity and equity lens. To achieve these goals, we will
develop and maintain a website and distribution channels; hold quarterly Network meetings, monthly Working Groups,
annual writing camps, and annual intensive Data Workshops; centralize information about data sources on HCBS for PwD
within a new Dementia HCBS Data Center; and hold translation and dissemination training seminars."

Children with nephrotic syndrome, especially those that have frequent relapses (FRNS) or are resistant to
steroid therapy (SRNS), are exposed to prolonged courses of steroids and other immunosuppressant
medications. Given the adverse side effect profiles and variable efficacy of these medications, there is an
urgent need to identify novel and safe therapies to treat nephrotic syndrome in children. Stimulation of the
vagus nerve, which can be activated non-invasively by transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation
(taVNS), modulates the immune system by the inflammatory reflex and spleen. taVNS has become a therapy
of interest for treating chronic immune-mediated illnesses. The central hypothesis is that activation of the
inflammatory reflex via taVNS modulates the immune response, attenuates relapses and proteinuria, and
reduces reliance on immunosuppressant medications in children with nephrotic syndrome. The overarching
goal is to conduct a large scale, multicenter clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of taVNS in the
treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children. To optimally prepare for this larger clinical trial, the objective of
this proposal is to conduct pilot clinical trials to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of taVNS for the
treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children and generate preliminary data to guide power calculations for a
future larger study. In this context, the specific aims of this proposal are: (Aim 1) To determine the feasibility of
protocol implementation and tolerability of taVNS in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children; (Aim 2) To
establish proof of concept and generate effect sizes for treatment response outcomes in children with nephrotic
syndrome randomized to taVNS therapy compared with sham therapy; (Aim 3) To investigate the effects of
taVNS on immune markers in children with nephrotic syndrome. The proposed pilot study will enroll 30 children
with FRNS and 10 children with SRNS age 3-17 years from two sites in two parallel, double-blinded,
randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing five minutes of daily taVNS use with sham therapy for 26
weeks. To test for feasibility and tolerability of the clinical trial, the process of recruitment, adherence
, device
functionality, time and resource utilization, and
safety monitoring will be examined. Using pre-specified proof-
of-concept criteria, preliminary data gathered from this pilot study will then be used to determine whether a
subsequent larger main trial should move forward. Further,
immune markers including serum and monocyte-
stimulated cytokines and anti-nephrin antibodies will be measured in order to characterize the
immunomodulatory effect of taVNS therapy. To this end, accomplishing the goals of this pilot study will provide
preliminary data that will inform the design of and strengthen the implementation of a planned larger clinical
trial. Providing these preliminary data that are essential to conduct a large-scale trial will address a significant
knowledge gap and will pave the way for evaluation of an innovative, non-pharmacologic, non-invasive,
steroid-sparing approach to the treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children."
10896272,"Project Summary/Abstract
For older adults, prolonged hospitalization can lead to a devastating loss of mobility and independence. Each
year, 12 million adults over the age of 65 are hospitalized, and 30% are discharged to a post-acute care
facility. One of the risks of hospitalization is bed rest, which is associated with a number of hospital-acquired
complications, including falls, delirium, venous thrombosis and skin breakdown. Hospital mobility programs
attempt to ambulate patients up to three times daily, but this work is generally assigned to nurses, who have
many competing and often more pressing tasks. Consequently, ambulating patients is the most frequently
overlooked nursing duty. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting
nursing shortage. Small studies have examined the benefits of mobility technicians (MTs), whose sole job is to
safely ambulate patients. These studies have demonstrated that MTs can increase steps taken, but they are
too small to prove the impact of MTs on other outcomes, such as whether patients have in-hospital
complications or whether they can go home instead of to a post-acute care facility. Hospitals are hesitant to
adopt MT programs because they perceive them to be expensive and unproven. We propose to conduct a
large randomized trial to test the impact of MTs on short and intermediate term outcomes for 3000 patients
aged 65 years and older at 5 hospitals in 2 health systems. Patients will be randomized to receive supervised
ambulation up to 3 times daily with a MT or to receive usual care. All participants will wear an accelerometer on
their wrist to track their movement throughout the hospital stay. The study has 3 aims. First, we will compare
the mobility of patients at discharge (or 10 days) to assess the impact of the MTs on this outcome. We are
particularly interested in whether the use of MTs will increase the proportion of patients who can go home vs.
post-acute care, and whether the improvements in mobility are sustained at 30 days. Second, we will use
predictive modeling to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from this intervention. Third, we will
assess the impact of the intervention on overall costs associated with the episode of care, including inpatient
costs and the 30 days after discharge. This information will be important to convince health systems to adopt
this approach."

Social interactions between bacteria impact infectious disease transmission and progression. The molecular
mechanisms underlying bacteria-bacteria competition and communication also represent a largely unexplored
set of therapeutic targets that could be manipulated to treat or prevent infections. Contact-dependent growth
inhibition (CDI) is a phenomenon in which Gram-negative bacteria deliver the toxic C-terminus of a large,
polymorphic surface protein (BcpA) to the cytoplasm of neighboring bacteria upon direct cell-cell contact,
inhibiting the growth of the targeted recipient cell unless it produces an appropriate immunity protein (BcpI).
While CDI systems have been investigated almost exclusively for their ability to mediate inter-bacterial
competition, our previous work indicated that CDI systems also facilitate inter-bacterial communication by
inducing specific gene expression and phenotypic changes in immune recipient bacteria (those producing the
appropriate immunity protein, BcpI). Thus, CDI systems enable bacterial self/nonself discrimination through
several overlapping mechanisms, all of which could be exploited therapeutically. However, fundamental gaps
in knowledge of CDI system molecular function prevent a clear understanding of how these proteins impact
bacterial sociality and limit the development of CDI system-based antimicrobials, decontaminants, or vaccines.
Thus, our long term goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying CDI system function toward
manipulating these proteins for the treatment or prevention of infectious disease. Our preliminary data show
that Burkholderia species provide a tractable model system for interrogating CDI system biology. This proposal
seeks to understand how BcpA is delivered from one bacterium to another and how this process shapes
bacterial behavior. Toward these goals, the proposal tests the hypothesis that Burkholderia BcpA exchange is
controlled by BcpA-specific domains, recipient cell receptors, and the physiological state of the recipient cell,
which together impact microbial community development. The proposed model will be tested by (1) identifying
the recipient factors that impact BcpA import, and (2) defining BcpA domains responsible for maintaining
appropriate delivery to recipients and testing the role of BcpA delivery in Burkholderia communities. Together,
this research will provide critical insight into a specific mechanism of bacterial cell-cell communication, leading
to advancement in the prevention or treatment of bacterial infections."

Exercise is an effective intervention for both the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases, but the
mechanistic underpinnings of the health benefits of exercise remain incompletely defined. Recent work
highlights the importance of inter-organ circuits in mediating healthful exercise responses. We identified β-
aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) as a novel small molecule “myokine” that increases the expression of brown
adipocyte-specific genes in vitro, and improves glucose disposal and decreases weight gain in mice. In
humans, plasma BAIBA concentrations are increased with chronic exercise and demonstrate a strong inverse
association with metabolic risk factors. Further, related efforts by our group have positioned us as leaders in
characterizing within- and between-tissue molecular responses to exercise and dietary interventions.
These experiences, coupled with the high translational relevance of the research problem, motivated our
participation in the first phase of the MoTrPAC initiative. Our team was built upon existing collaborations
between Duke, Harvard and the Broad Institute with complementary strengths in metabolomics and proteomics
technologies and decades of experience in cardiometabolic research. During the initial MoTrPAC funding
period, we provided a deep menu of analytical tools for targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, protein
profiling, and the analysis of key protein post-translational modifications. Group members were deeply involved
in the animal and pre-COVID biochemical profiling efforts, in collaborations with other Chemical Analysis Sites
(CAS) and the Bioinformatics Core to harmonize work flows, and in the working groups necessary to integrate
the data. We have also played key roles in associated scholarly activities and in developing the next
generation of translational investigators focused on exercise science.
An additional distinction of our team is the ability to integrate new findings from MoTrPAC with ongoing
genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses in large human cohorts and other exercise studies led by our
investigators. We hypothesize that integrating the metabolomic and proteomic profiles of human tissues and
blood during exercise with genetics and detailed human phenotyping will provide novel insights into the inter-
organ circuits and within-organ responses that mediate its salutary effects. We are deeply committed to the
notion that all data generated by this multi-disciplinary consortium will be made rapidly available to the
scientific community. Importantly, all four leaders of this proposed core (Carr, Clish, Gerszten and Newgard)
have strong track records in the use of metabolomics and proteomics tools for the identification of novel
cardiometabolic regulatory and disease mechanisms. These experiences position our CAS as one that can
have maximal impact on the generation, analysis, and interpretation of molecular profiling data in the next
phase of MoTrPAC."
10892614,"Project Summary/Abstract -- Non-invasive, continuous BP monitoring for prenatal maternal health
Hypertensive disorders affect up to 15% of pregnancies and can lead to serious complications for both
mother and child. Preeclampsia is the most severe hypertensive disorder during pregnancy. In addition to
being the second leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, it is responsible for up to 2.6 million
premature births and about 0.5 million infant deaths each year. Timely intervention can mitigate the impact of
gestational hypertension but requires close monitoring of blood pressure (BP) which is difficult to achieve over
the weeks of late pregnancy where the patient is at greatest risk. There is a critical need for a BP
monitoring device for prenatal care that is comfortable, accurate, and easy to use.
PyrAmes has developed a comfortable wearable device to collect arterial pulse waveform data to monitor BP
in real time using a combination of capacitive pulse sensing and machine learning techniques. The technology
was pioneered by our co-founder/advisor, Stanford Prof. Zhenan Bao, and is exclusively licensed to PyrAmes.
The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous
determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to use
and non-invasively records waveform data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties and
risks of placing and maintaining an arterial line. It can provide results comparable to gold standard arterial line
monitoring without perturbing the patients for more timely and accurate measurements than possible with cuffs.
PyrAmes’ Boppli™ device for infants is based on this technology and received FDA Breakthrough Device
Designation. It is in pilot production and is currently FDA review based on data from a multi-site pivotal study to
collect pulse waveform data from preterm neonates in the NICU with an arterial line in place, with a primary
objective of measuring BP within the FDA guidelines for accuracy.
The objective of the R61 phase is to extend PyrAmes’ platform to monitor pregnant women. This goal will be
consenting expectant mothers receiving blood pressure measurements during office visits or when hospitalized
before delivery. We will use the data collected in the proposed study to refine the artificial neural networks
used to extract BP values from the PyrAmes pulse waveform data with a focus on obtaining more accurate
results for pregnant women. Our success metric for this study on expectant mothers will be to exceed the
quality and accuracy of our preliminary models for these women. We also plan to determine if the pulse
waveform shape can serve as a timely biomarker of hypertensive disorders that can occur during pregnancy.
The R33 phase will include a follow-up IRB-approved validation study using the device and models from the
R61 phase to position our device for FDA clearance and to scale up to pilot production of this device."
10893996,"Periodontitis (PD) is the second most common oral disease, affecting about half of adults (65 millions) in the
United States. Periodontitis causes tooth loss and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several serious
systemic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and premature birth. Periodontitis is a chronic
inflammatory disease, triggered by bacterial infection present in dental plaques and calculus; but actual disease
manifestations are caused by host immune response to these pathogens. Current standard treatment is
debridement of plaques and calculus to reduce the bacterial load; however, there are no therapies that address
the immune component of PD. Thus, many research groups have started developing technologies to regulate
the immune response and reduce inflammation. Our group has focused on recruiting and polarizing M2
macrophage as novel approaches for therapy of periodontitis. In our previous study, we successfully prevented
alveolar bone loss by locally inducing M2 macrophages in mouse periodontitis models. M2 macrophages were
polarized by injecting C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) releasing PLGA microparticles (MPs) into periodontal
tissues. The results indicated that inducing M2 macrophages by local delivery of CCL2 indeed reduces
inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis. The proposed study will explore further the therapeutic potential of
M2 macrophage induction by CCL2 as well as shed light on the mechanism underlying this process. We
hypothesize that CCL2 plays a key role in maintaining periodontal immune homeostasis, and that its exogenous
delivery, or genetic ablation, would modify the course of PD through periodontal breakdown, repair and
microbiota dysbiosis. Macrophages play an important role in both the destructive and constructive phases of
the inflammatory response by modulating their ability to polarize into either M1 (pro-inflammatory/pro-destructive)
or M2 (anti-inflammatory/pro-reparative) macrophages. Our hypothesis is strongly supported by our recent in
vivo data showing that the local delivery of CCL2 will induce differentiation of macrophages and monocytes to
an M2 phenotype, thus leading to decreased periodontal inflammatory bone loss and initiation of periodontal
repair. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To test CCL2 MPs as an interventional
and reparative periodontal therapy; 2) To study the periodontal phenotype, periodontal breakdown and repair in
CCL2-knockout mice (CCL2-KO); and 3) To perform Single cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-Seq) to acquire in-
depth mechanistic data about the role of CCL2, its association, effect on and interactions with other immune
cells. We anticipate that CCL2 released from PLGA MPs will inhibit further bone loss and promote repair in the
mouse periodontitis model. We also expect that CCL2-KO mice and ScRNA-Seq analysis will provide data critical
to understanding underlying mechanisms of CCL2’s immunoregulatory effects. In sum, we believe that M2
macrophage induction by CCL2 in inflamed periodontium could be a novel, promising strategy for treating PD."
10894173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project builds on the scientific premise of understanding the precise molecular mechanisms involved in the
development of right ventricular failure (RVF) secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH-RVF is a significant
prognostic determinant of morbidity and mortality in PH and is characterized by remodeling and fibrosis. Despite
the importance of RV function in PH, the mechanistic details of RVF secondary to PH remain elusive. Although
current therapies targeting pulmonary vasculature do offer some functional improvement for PH patients, yet no
approved therapies are available till date that directly target the failing RV. The goal of this project is to highlight
specific molecular mechanisms responsible for remodeling and fibrosis in the RV that may be targeted as novel
therapeutic strategies for PH-induced RVF. This proposal utilizes state-of-the-art RV bulk-RNA sequencing
analysis from two pre-clinical rat models of severe PH highlighting endothelial-to-mesenchymal-transition
(EndMT) as the top upregulated pathway and Snai1 (Snail) as a novel network hub promoting the development
of EndMT and fibrosis in RVF via Snai1-LOXL2-CTGF axis. This proposal tests the hypothesis that PH-RVF is
associated with EndMT and fibrosis governed by Snai1-LOXL2-CTGF axis through chromatin remodeling in the
RV. Targeting Snai1 and/or LOXL2 could serve as novel therapeutic strategies for PH-RVF. The proposal has
the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the mechanistic role of Snai1-LOXL2-CTGF axis in regulating RV EndMT
in PH-RVF in vivo and in vitro. Aim 2. Determine the mechanistic role of Snai1-LOXL2-CTGF axis in regulating
RV fibrosis in PH-RVF in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3. Investigate the mechanistic basis of Snai1 and/or LOXL2
knockdown as novel therapeutic strategies for PH-RVF in vivo and in vitro. The proposed studies are significant,
since they will highlight the importance of targeting Snai1 and its related network in vivo and in vitro to inhibit
EndMT and fibrosis and rescue RVF. The proposed studies are innovative, since they will employ tissue/cell-
specific analysis to identify and characterize novel therapeutic targets that are highly regulated by tissue/cell-
specific Snai1/LOXL2 knockdown/overexpression in the RVs of rats with PH-induced RVF (in vivo studies) as
well as Snai1/LOXL2 knockdown/overexpression in human coronary artery endothelial cells, and human cardiac
fibroblasts (in vitro studies). Upon completion, the proposed studies will have identified and addressed the
current gap in knowledge in the molecular basis of development of PH-induced RVF. The investigations will yield
important insights into the role of Snai1 and its co-partners in RV remodeling in RVF and may lead to
development of novel RV-specific therapeutic strategies."
10893995,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction, but the impact
of alcohol use on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is unknown. Our work suggests that
chronic alcohol can alter the activity of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the DRN, which may cause disruption in
sleep homeostasis in the early stages of ADRD. Both AUD and ADRD are associated with chronic insomnia,
but to date no studies have linked alcohol-induced sleep disturbances to tau-based neuropathology in the brain.
Sleep disruption also induces microglial activation and aging, which can promote the spread of tau pathology in
the brain. In Aim 1, we will use EEG, fiber photometry, electrophysiology and DREADD-based manipulations of
neural activity in vivo in mice expressing human tau pathology (htau mice) to determine whether chronic alcohol
exacerbates sleep deficits and whether enhanced neural activity in 5-HT neurons contributes to sleep
disruptions. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of chronic alcohol on microglia and their contribution to the
progression of tau pathology in the DRN. In Aim 3, we will determine whether chronic alcohol can facilitate the
spread of tau pathology from the DRN to other brain regions using an AAV-based strategy for expressing tau
pathology exclusively in 5-HT neurons. 3D immunolabeling and light sheet imaging using the iDISCO technique
will be used to identify areas and quantify the extent of tau spread. We will also examine whether neural activity
in 5-HT neurons and microglial activation contributes to this spread. In total, the proposed research will provide
mechanistic insight into the impact of chronic alcohol on early accumulation and spread of tau pathology in the
brain and the later development of cognitive and memory deficits."

Bacteria employ signaling systems to sense and respond to their environment. This allows them to adjust their
cellular physiology and collective behavior in response to environmental cues. One subset of these systems
are the Hanks-type serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases. These signaling systems have been shown to
be critical, and even often essential, for bacterial physiology, including cell growth and division, antibiotic
tolerance and resistance, sporulation and germination, virulence, and biofilm formation. To accomplish this,
these systems can regulate cellular function through direct post-translational modification of enzymes, or
control transcription by adding an additional layer of regulation to the activity of transcription factors from other
pathways. As a result, the activity of Hanks-type Ser/Thr signaling systems remains poorly understood,
particularly at the single-cell level, where these systems are known to regulate the appearance of rare cells
with extreme phenotypes such as increased antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence. The long-term goal of
my laboratory is to explore how these signaling systems regulate population and single-cell-level phenotypes
and thereby to understand their contribution to human health and disease. To do so, we will 1) perform a
mechanistic and quantitative study of conserved bacterial Hanks-type Ser/Thr kinase-phosphatase systems,
focused on understanding how their regulatory architecture enables the generation of rare cells in bacterial
populations with extreme phenotypes, 2) determine the role of these signaling systems in developmental
transitions such as competence, biofilm formation, and sporulation. Initially we will focus on these systems in
the model organism Bacillus subtilis, with the long-term goal to uncover the conserved features that can be
generalized to other, less genetically tractable, and clinically important bacteria."

 Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a disease that kills 1.4
million people every year. There is no reliable vaccine to prevent TB, yet many latently-infected individuals are
protected from progressing to active TB despite heavy Mtb exposure living in an endemic setting. CD4+ T cells
are critical for host protection against TB as they interact directly with Mtb-infected cells, secrete cytokines and
cytolytic molecules, and recruit or augment other immune cells. However, the candidate and others find that not
all T cells specific for Mtb antigens are able to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages, the niche cell for Mtb. A
critical unmet need for vaccine development is to define the antigen specificities and functions of T cells that can
recognize infected macrophages and prevent progression to active TB. In Aim 1, the candidate uses autologous
ex vivo co-culture and T cell antigen receptor (TCR) sequencing to determine the proportion, antigen specificities
and functions of memory CD4+ T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. In Aim 2, the candidate
expands on this system to compare the repertoires of memory CD4 T cells that respond to infected macrophages
among two groups of individuals who live in a setting endemic for TB yet differ in their susceptibility to active
disease. Using single-cell transcriptomics, the candidate compares the functions and TCR repertoires of Mtb-
specific memory CD4+ T cells isolated from exposed individuals who do not develop active TB (“stable” latent
Mtb infection) vs. individuals who will later progress to active TB (“pre-TB” progressors). Results from this project
will define key features of protective memory CD4+ T cells that are linked to the prevention of active TB, providing
benchmarks for vaccine development and improvement of TB risk stratification.

The goal of this project is to develop a novel immunological-directed Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP) that
leverages natural microbiome pathways to inhibit gut inflammatory processes for the treatment of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Over 3 million adults in the U.S. suffer from IBD, an umbrella term encompassing two
chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)1.
IBD is typically diagnosed in the second or third decades of life, is life-long, and there is no cure. Current IBD
treatments can have serious side-effects, and patients become refractory. Novel therapies that are safe and
effective, particularly restoring the intestinal membrane barrier, are needed and would be life changing.
Intestinal immune regulatory signals tightly govern healthy gut homeostasis, and their breakdown may result in
IBD39. The human microbiome, harboring trillions of bacteria, is a critical regulator of these mechanisms.
Commensal bacteria function to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and regulate innate and adaptive
immune cell function40. Surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed on innate immune intestinal cells to fine immunity
in steady state and diseased conditions41-44. Recently, our research team demonstrated that SlpA is the
predominant anti-inflammatory Slp signal. SlpA binds to the C-type lectin Specific Intracellular adhesion
molecule-3 Grabbing Non-integrin homolog-Related 3 (SIGNR3) receptor expressed on dendritic cells lining
the gut prevents experimentally induced colitis in multiple models15. Oral delivery of SlpA via L. lactis (also
known as R-3750 or R110) reduced inflammatory cytokines, strengthened the mucosal membrane barrier, and
supported a healthier microbiota make-up in animal models of gut inflammation64. Notably, the effects and
protection mediated by SlpA were not observed in Signr3-/- mice, suggesting that SlpA interaction with SIGNR3
plays a key protective role in regulating the disease condition15.
Our goal is to develop R-3750, a SlpA-expressing Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain, as a novel, orally administered
drug that functions as immune therapy to reduce gut inflammation, improve gastrointestinal mucosal barrier
function, and restore the natural microbiome make-up in IBD patients. L. lactis provides two key advantages as
a delivery vehicle for conveying SlpA to the gut: 1) it has already been safely used in human clinical trials in
wild type and genetically manipulated forms16, 45 19 and 2) it does not express any native Slps but can be
engineered to selectively overexpress SlpA. This Fast-Track SBIR application is focused on obtaining human
validation for R-3750 by completing a first-in-human Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial. The Specific Aims
are: 1) prepare and file an IND with the FDA, 2) complete capsule manufacturing to support the clinical study,
3) perform the Phase 1 clinical trial, 4) analyze samples from the patients for key pharmacodynamic responses
and clinical biomarkers, and 5) prepare GMP scale up production processes for Phase 2 drug manufacturing."

Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. This innovative multi-PI project in its 6th
year has established a novel approach to the challenge of discovering strategies to control cancer. Oncogenic
activation of the RAS family of GTPases occurs in ~30% of cancers making it the most frequently mutated
oncogene in human cancers. Despite impressive progress in our understanding of the biochemistry of RAS and
its role in tumorigenesis over the past 3 decades and the excitement of the first approved drug that directly
targets a particular oncogenic RAS mutant, development of effective therapeutics targeting RAS remains a grand
challenge. We have pioneered the use of monobody technology to define previously unrecognized vulnerabilities
in RAS. Monobodies are small synthetic binding proteins that achieve levels of affinity and selectivity for their
target similar to antibodies and can be used as tool biologics in biochemical, structural, cellular and in vivo studies.
In the current project period, we have developed and used two monobodies, NS1 and R15, to gain new insights
into RAS function and vulnerabilities. NS1 revealed the importance of the α4-α5 interface implicated in RAS
dimerization. R15 revealed the feasibility of targeting the nucleotide-free (apo) state of a subset of oncogenic
RAS mutants, despite the conventional wisdom that one cannot effectively compete against tightly bound
nucleotides in RAS. Furthermore, we have established the feasibility of developing monobodies that
noncovalently and selectively inhibit oncogenic RAS mutants and of selectively degrading RAS mutants using
monobody-VHL fusions. Building on these successes and strong preliminary data, the next phase of this project
aims to accomplish the following: 1, We will utilize NS1, R15 and additional monobodies as highly selective
perturbants to address important mechanistic questions in RAS biology, including roles of dimerization/self-
association in RAS effector activation, roles of wild-type KRAS in heterozygous KRAS mutant cells, and roles of
KRAS4A in tumorigenesis. 2, We will establish cell lines and mouse models using genetically encoded
monobodies to determine how specific modes of RAS inhibition affect tumorigenesis in vivo driven by oncogenic
RAS mutants. 3, We will develop monobodies with new specificity profiles to expand the scope of our project,
specifically those selective to NRAS, KRAS4A, and common RAS mutations. Results from this project will
advance our mechanistic understanding of RAS function at the biochemical, cellular and in vivo levels and inform
the development of therapeutics directly targeting RAS. Furthermore, uniquely powerful tools developed in this
project will empower the entire RAS community."
10894020,"Project Summary/Abstract
Episodic memory impairment is a serious challenge for individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders
that impact the hippocampus, including epilepsy, brain injury, neurodegeneration, schizophrenia, and PTSD.
The development of effective treatments will require better understanding of brain mechanisms that support
memory formation, storage, and retrieval. The goal of this project is to improve such understanding by testing a
hypothesis about the role of the human hippocampus and its interactions with large-scale brain networks in
memory formation. Episodic memory formation is a temporally extended process whereby individuals actively
sample information in the environment via saccadic eye movements (for visual information), bind this
information into an evolving memory representation, and then use this memory representation to inform
subsequent viewing of information, and so on. Although the necessary role of the hippocampus in episodic
memory formation is well established, little is known regarding how it participates in the extended process of
memory formation that occurs during active sampling. This represents a knowledge gap in mechanistic
understanding of episodic memory formation, as active sampling is the dominant manner in which memories
are created. This project tests the role of the human hippocampus in providing online representation of
episodic content and providing the top-down signals to brain networks for visuospatial attention and visual
processing needed to drive visual sampling for the formation of coherent episodic memories. This hypothesis
will be tested in several experiments that measure and manipulate hippocampal activity within eye-tracking
tasks designed to isolate the interplay between memory and visual sampling during memory formation. These
experiments will be performed in individuals with epilepsy undergoing neurosurgical procedures as part of
clinical care, as this provides invasive recordings of neural activity (iEEG) from the hippocampus and other
regions of interest with temporal resolution that matches the rapid pace of eye movements. The temporal
resolution of iEEG is key to addressing the hypotheses concerning how the hippocampus drives visual
sampling, in addition to responding to it. Direct electrical stimulation through the iEEG electrodes will also be
used to test the necessary role of hippocampal processing in driving active visual sampling. By rigorously
testing the role of hippocampus in interaction with large-scale networks during the process of memory
formation that occurs via active sampling, this project aims to better understand mechanisms relevant to the
disruptions of memory formation that occur in neurological and psychiatric disorders. These findings could
inform technological approaches to treat memory disorders."

Bernstein's goal is to build the skills and knowledge required to become an independent investigator who can
use mixed methods to understand and address challenges that occur at the intersection of clinical practice, the
community, and policy in dementia. The research project proposed in this application focuses on the challenge
of caregiver wellbeing as a first step towards her long-term career objective. Through the project, Dr. Bernstein
aims to integrate knowledge about the social and environmental conditions of caregivers of individuals with
Alzheimer's disease into understandings of caregiver burden, resilience, and resource use.
To become an independent researcher, Dr. Bernstein will be supported by an outstanding mentorship team of
clinicians and social scientist researchers at UCSF, a world-class research and training institution with a strong
commitment to multidisciplinary research and clinical practice focused on dementia, aging, and caregiving. Dr.
Bernstein will utilize these resources to develop knowledge and skills in the following areas through
coursework, seminars, mentored tutorials, and practical experience: (1) Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
technology; (2) Advanced mixed-methods research and data analysis; (3) The science of caregiving in
dementia; (4) Professional advancement skills required for independence.
Using these skills, the proposed research assesses the social and emotional experiences and spatial
movement of caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the home and community. Over 15 million
family members or friends provide care for individuals with AD or other dementias in the U.S. Many caregivers
experience caregiver burden, and are at a high risk for social isolation and loneliness, all of which can have
negative impacts on health and wellbeing. Yet, only a quarter of caregivers access support resources. We do
not fully understand how to intervene in caregivers' experiences in the home and community to reduce burden.
The proposed research will be conducted amongst spousal caregivers of people with AD through the following
research aims: (1) Map and analyze the objective spatial activity of family caregivers living with people with
Alzheimer's disease; (2) Examine and characterize family caregivers' subjective social networks and emotional
experiences; and (3) Create and analyze integrated visual representations of objective spatial data and
subjective social experiences to identify potential interventions. This research will provide guidance in
designing interventions integrating qualitative and spatial analyses to improve caregiver wellbeing."

 Cognitive load during the delivery of clinical care is affected by a number of factors including specialty,
practice setting, patient complexity, electronic health record (EHR) use, and clinician expertise. In the United
States, clinical care is primarily documented using EHRs: documentation burden, poor usability, and
unnecessary navigation contribute to increased cognitive load. Such increases in cognitive load, in turn,
contribute to more work hours, dissatisfaction with work, poor patient outcomes (e.g., errors), burnout and poor
clinician outcomes. Much of the prior research characterizing clinician cognitive load or its impact on errors has
relied on retrospective approaches including self-reports, time-motion studies, and focus groups. Similarly,
burnout also has been measured exclusively using surveys. EHR-based audit logs have shown considerable
promise as a viable resource for tracking and measuring clinical activities without the incremental survey
burden on clinicians. Our research team has demonstrated that workload measures based on audit logs can
be used to assess cognitive load, burnout, and errors. Based on this promising pilot work, the primary focus of
the IGNITE (Integrating real-time clinical activity and behavioral responses for characterizing cognitive load
and errors) study is to utilize EHR-based audit logs and decision support tools to objectively determine the
direct relationships between (a) cognitive load and errors, and (b) the mediating role of clinician burnout in
explaining the relationship between cognitive load and errors. We will accomplish this through a large-scale
multi-site study conducted at three large academic medical centers associated with Washington University/BJC
HealthCare, Stanford University, and University of Colorado. For the first aim, we will utilize EHR-based audit
logs collected across non-surgical, inpatient settings across three sites over a 3-year period (1/1/2019 to
12/31/2021) to develop measures of cognitive load—both intrinsic and extraneous—and assess the effect of
cognitive load on objectively measured wrong-patient errors (using the retract-and-reorder alerts). For the
second aim, we will prospectively collect data on a cohort of 300 trainees (residents, fellows) from Medicine
and Pediatrics from each study site over a 5-month period. Monthly burnout surveys, along with cognitive load
measures from the EHR-based audit logs, and wrong-patient errors during the study period will be used to
determine the mediating relationships between cognitive load, burnout and errors. In addition, for both of the
proposed aims, we will develop advanced machine learning algorithms to predict errors and burnout from
EHR-based activity sequences. Insights from this study will help in designing targeted interventions aligned
with the contextual work practices of physicians, designing clinical trials for evaluating such interventions, and
in developing informed policy guidelines for the safety and well-being of physicians."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. Cardiovascular
mortality rates positively correlate with the presence of diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are
rising in epidemic proportions and leading to poor outcomes including heart failure. There is a consensus that
abdominal obesity is a major driving force in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, with severe adverse
effects on cardiovascular risk factors. In the midst of a growing recognition of how adipose tissue dysfunction
and adipokine imbalance affect cardiac disease in the obese population, a less-well understood mechanism is
the effect of cardiac metabolism and function on systemic metabolic homeostasis. In fact, little is known about
the factors that link cardiac dysfunction and systemic metabolism. I have a long-standing interest in translational
cardiovascular research, with previous investigations showing that elevated GRK2 activity and expression occurs
early in disease and contributes to progression. Recently, my lab has shown that cardiac restricted expression
of a short, amino terminal fragment of GRK2 (βARKnt) is cardioprotective. Further, while GRK2 negatively affects
insulin signaling through a direct interaction with and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1),
βARKnt enhances activation of the insulin signaling pathway and mitochondrial efficiency. Our preliminary data
also show that βARKnt reduces abdominal fat content and preserves systemic insulin responsiveness during
high fat diet-induced obesity. Currently, we discovered selective interactions of endogenous GRK2 and βARKnt
with Akt substrate of 160kDa (AS160). Pathway analysis of this proteomic data confirmed an AS160/GRK2 link
and involved numerous regulators of insulin signaling. AS160 has been identified as nodal regulator between
insulin signaling and glucose uptake, but research into its physiological role in cardiomyocyte metabolism has
been hampered by limitations of available or selected models. We hypothesize that enhancing AS160 signaling
in cardiomyocytes improves their metabolic flexibility in a cardioprotective manner and translates these to
beneficial effects on systemic insulin responsiveness. Aim 1 will interrogate the physiological role of cardiac
AS160 in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 membrane trafficking and the functional consequences for metabolite uptake
and mitochondrial respiration in the heart. Aim 2 will elucidate the composition of the cardiac AS160 regulatory
complex using cross-linking/mass spectrometry to visualize the components and their interactions in human left
ventricular samples from patients with heart failure with or without diabetes compared to murine mimics of
disease. These studies seek to fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding the composition of the cardiac
AS160 regulatory complex, how it is altered during cardiometabolic stress, how it regulates cardiomyocyte
metabolite utilization, and whether it translates this to influencing systemic metabolic performance. Our overall
goal is to gain a better understanding of the regulation and relevance of AS160 in cardiomyocyte insulin-
responsiveness and whether it represents a therapeutic target for cardiometabolic disease."

Activity from steel, petroleum, and chemical industries has resulted in extensive metal and organic compound
contamination in northern Lake County, Indiana. Residents have consistently voiced the need for more
community input and unbiased data on the extent and the health impacts of their chemical exposures. Many of
these contaminants, individually, are recognized as neurological toxicants; however, scientific understanding of
the cumulative impact of exposure to multiple contaminants remains unclear. Therefore, our goal is to conduct
a community-engaged assessment of the patterns of exposure to metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
as well as their potential associations with selected health outcomes, particularly neurological health. We will
accomplish this through completion of a cross-sectional study of 300 adults and 100 children from northern Lake
County, Indiana. Community engagement will be achieved through a) engagement with a Community Advisory
Board (CAB) to provide advice on all aspects of the project; b) employment of residents to serve as Community
Health Workers (CHWs) to work closely with individual residents to share information about the project, recruit
participants, and conduct study visits; c) empowerment of participants by involving them in collecting their own
environmental and biological samples through a specialized sampling kit; and d) community outreach. In Aim 1,
we will determine a) toxic metal concentrations in house dust, soils, tap water, hair and toenail samples as well
as b) benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other common VOCs in
ground-level air samples and silicone wristbands. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in ambient air samples will
also be determined. CHWs will show participants how to collect samples from their home using the sampling kit.
The kit components have been validated; samples will be analyzed by scientific staff using semi-automated X-
ray fluorimeters (XRF), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and gas chromatograph mass
spectrometers (GC-MS). In Aim 2, we will assess the correlation of mixed chemical exposure with self-reported
general health status, cognitive and emotional function, and epigenetic profiles. Trained study staff will be trained
to administer the cognitive battery from the NIH Toolbox via videoconference. Epigenetic changes include altered
methylation patterns in genes known to be related to neurologic disease. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the
effectiveness of our community engagement strategies. Specifically, we will explore whether these strategies
are effective at promoting participation in project activities and increasing the knowledge of environmental and
health issues. At the conclusion of this community engaged research, we will have completed a high-quality
assessment of the extent and characteristics of exposure to metals and VOCs in northern Lake County;
determined correlations of these exposures with selected health outcomes; and determined which community
engagement methods were most effective in this community."

Abstract
There is a fundamental gap in understanding the mechanisms that determine progression in human kidney disease. The long-term goal is to characterize key cellular and molecular pathways regulating progression of acute and chronic kidney diseases (AKI and CKD), to identify novel markers that assess disease progression, and to develop specific therapeutic interventions targeting these pathways. There is often heterogeneity in the pattern of kidney injury whereby various cell types and cell states are differentially distributed across focal regions of a biopsy specimen. Immune cell sub-populations are observed in these injury regions, suggesting robust cross-talk between infiltrating immune cells and the resident renal epithelial, endothelial, and stromal cells. Further, these regional molecular disease phenotypes often are not fully appreciated on standard histopathologic assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need to expand our efforts to comprehensively localize cell types and cell states in the kidney, sub-phenotype disease, uncover cell-cell interactions, and understand the cellular and molecular phenotypes underlying morphologic changes in the kidney. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that mechanisms of kidney disease can only be understood when the diversity of cellular and molecular phenotypes are interpreted in the spatial context of the individuals’ kidney. The central hypothesis will be tested using an integrated pipeline of spatially resolved imaging, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies that will capture the features of kidney disease at the cell, regional, and organ levels. These technologies include large scale 3D microscopy and tissue cytometry (3DTC), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) multiplexed immunofluorescence. Together, this analytical pipeline will facilitate mapping of injury distribution and effectively link with other KPMP technologies through the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Deploy a suite of KPMP-approved spatial technologies as a synchronized analytical pipeline to define the cellular components and molecular structure of each human kidney biopsy. Specific Aim 2: Integrate imaging, transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures from each biopsy specimen to generate a multi-component spatial map of cellular and molecular phenotypes. Specific Aim 3: Integrate our analytical pipeline across the KPMP, linking our spatially-anchored cellular and molecular phenotypes to other KPMP technologies, pathology, and clinical features. The proposed research is significant, because it is the next step in a continuum of research that is expected to identify critically needed biomarkers of disease progression, optimize preclinical studies, and develop specific and targeted therapeutic interventions in the vast clinical problem of AKI and CKD."

Pathological changes in the human metabolome are ubiquitous and fundamental to the pathogenesis of all brain
disorders including cancer, dementia, and psychiatric disorders. This project proposes to develop a non-invasive
magnetic resonance imaging tool to interrogate human brain metabolism in an unprecedented way using the
world’s first ultra-high field 10.5 T whole-body human MRI scanner and a novel dynamic deuterium to proton
exchange (2H-to-1H) MRS approach. Two complimentary strategies, single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and MR
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) will be developed in parallel. 2H-to-1H MRS will be able to quantify and image
concentrations and metabolic fluxes in the human brain in vivo through the entire metabolic pathway from a
single scan. In the first part of this project, we will utilize state-of-the-art MR-compatible sensors and calibration
scans to accurately characterize spatial field inhomogeneities and monitor scanner- and subject-dependent
temporal instabilities at 10.5 T. In the second part, we will develop and validate a novel dynamic 1H-SVS
technique at 10.5 T with the focus on maximizing the range of reproducibly detectable metabolites by targeting
a single accurately defined brain region. In the third part, we will establish a new highly accurate and robust
dynamic 1H-MRSI method for 10.5 T, which will trade-off the ability to interrogate a broad range of metabolites
for the ability to image some of them over the entire brain. In the final part, we will proof the feasibility of
measuring human brain metabolism in vivo non-invasively via dynamic 2H-to-1H MRS at 10.5 T and 7 T using
2H-labled glucose and estimate experimental and physiologic variability. We will compare the performance of
our novel tool to deuterium metabolic imaging. Successful completion of this project will provide a powerful tool
for neuroscience and metabolic research."

 Infections are the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) patients. Infections contribute to delayed or failed engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells (HSPCs). To study the mechanism underlying infection-related impaired HSPC function, our lab has utilized
a Mycobacterium avium infection model and discovered that chronic infection depletes HSCs by impairing self-
renewal and promoting myeloid differentiation – through increased activation and transcription of myeloid
differentiation genes such as Batf2, Fosb, and Jun– via an interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-dependent mechanism.
Further, the lab showed that inflammation-induced myeloid differentiation is epigenetically driven, as the
knockout of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A led to suppression of the myeloid differentiation response. Based
on these data from our group’s previous studies, I hypothesize that HSPCs undergo a malleable epigenetic
reprogramming in response to IFNγ that promotes myeloid differentiation and affects downstream immune
responses. By defining the extent of epigenetic reprogramming, I seek to identify strategies to preserve HSC
function despite infectious stress and thereby improve HSCT outcomes.
 Whereas our lab showed that IFNγ-dependent changes in DNA methylation contribute to HSC
differentiation and exhaustion during chronic infection, the impact of IFNγ stimulation on histone modifications,
another key mechanism of epigenetic regulation, has not been studied in HSPCs. Therefore, the first objective
is to determine whether IFNγ induces histone modifications in HSPCs to promote myeloid differentiation.
Specifically, I will use epigenomic sequencing techniques CUT&RUN-seq and ATAC-seq to determine the
changes in histone modifications and chromatin accessibility in HSPCs under inflammatory stress. Next, I will
identify which pre-stimulated HSPC subpopulations are functionally reprogrammed by transplanting M. avium-
stimulated HSPC subpopulations into naïve recipients and challenging the recipients 3 months later with M.
avium. Finally, I will investigate the malleability of these epigenetic modifications by exposing M. avium-
stimulated HSPCs to subsequent high-dose LPS. I will perform RNA-seq, CUT&RUN-seq, and ATAC-seq, and
immune challenge experiments post-transplant to determine whether HSPCs exposed to LPS after M. avium
stimulation show altered differentiation responses compared to those exposed to M. avium alone. Overall, the
work in this proposal will uncover the mechanisms by which IFNγ promotes myeloid differentiation and HSC
exhaustion during chronic inflammation and enable the development of therapeutic approaches to prevent graft
loss in the early post-transplant period."

 The medical burden of urinary tract infection (UTI) is significant as they directly contribute to 1% of all clinical
visits in the United States. Annual medical expenses attributed to UTI currently exceed $3.5 billion. As a global
health concern, UTIs mainly affect women and commonly progress into recurrent UTI (rUTI) when a patient
experiences 3 or more UTIs in a 12 month period. The risk of rUTI increases with age, leading to
disproportionately high incidence rates in postmenopausal (PM) women. Effective therapies for rUTI are severely
limited as most treatment strategies rely on long-term antibiotic therapy with the goal of achieving sterility within
the urinary tract. However, even healthy urine is not sterile, and it has been confirmed that a microbial community
resides in the healthy urinary tract of PM women, termed here the urobiome. To date, most therapeutic strategies
for rUTI do not consider the preservation or restoration of the resident microbiota of the urinary or urogenital
tract. Interestingly, the urobiome has been shown to be interconnected with the vaginal microbiome and vaginal
D(-)Lactate-producing lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus crispatus, have been shown to protect against bacterial
vaginosis. Vaginal lactobacilli have been associated with circulating estrogen levels and early clinical studies
found that estrogen hormone therapy (EHT) is strongly associated with vaginal lactobacilli enrichment in PM
women. Interestingly, EHT is now widely becoming recognized as an effective treatment option for rUTI in PM
women, but the mechanism behind this observation is unknown. We have observed a strong association
between EHT use and urinary L. crispatus enrichment in our metagenomic analysis of the urobiome of a
controlled cross-sectional cohort of PM women (n=75). These observations have led me to ask a fundamental
question: How does estrogen enrich for Lactobacillus communities in the urobiome? This proposal centers
around the following hypothesis: EHT, as a treatment for rUTI, enhances Lactobacillus colonization of the
urinary tract by stimulating host production of nutrient sources and scaffolding attachment sites needed
for colonization. To test these hypotheses, I will characterize the effect of EHT treatment on the metabolism of
cultured primary urothelial cells and use a curated biobank of bacterial isolates from our de-identified human
cohorts to study colonization of co-cultures of urothelial cells and L. crispatus in the presence and absence of
estrogen. The long-term goal of this proposal is to leverage the insight gained from testing these hypotheses to
identify alternate therapeutic targets for effective and safe adjunct therapies for rUTI. A central theme of this
proposal is to use the scientific goals as a vehicle to achieve critical training goals I and my sponsors believe will
greatly help in my future independent research career."

underrepresented in biomedical research will be encouraged and welcomed, recruiting efforts will focus on
students who belong to one of three minority groups significant to Utah and Salt Lake City: Hispanic/Latino,
American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. Hispanic/Latinos comprise Utah’s
largest minority population, with 14% of the overall population and nearly 18% of the population under 18 years
of age. Also, Utah is home to eight American Indian tribes or nations, and a surprisingly large Pacific Islander
population including one-fourth of all Tongan Americans. These groups are massively underrepresented in
biomedical research, and they face significant cancer-related health disparities. This project will be led by a
team comprising a physician scientist and a basic scientist, who have relevant experience in programs to
increase diversity in biomedical research careers, career mentoring, and biomedical research career training.
Student research experiences will be enhanced by a rich professional preparation and community-building

 Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses that enhance or restore audition to severely
hearing-impaired adults and children. Sound from the environment is converted into electrical pulses and
conveyed to the auditory nerve by an array of electrodes. The cochlear implant provides important spectral and
temporal information to the listener. However, speech perception performance varies considerably among
cochlear implant listeners, particularly in noisy environments and for complex stimuli. This variability exists
even for children who receive their cochlear implants early in development (<2 years old).
 Recent evidence suggests that children have a higher density of healthy auditory neurons, which are
the target of stimulation through an implant. There is also a critical period for auditory developmental plasticity.
The interaction of these factors and the chronic electrical stimulation of a cochlear implant are not well
understood, especially for early-implanted children. Despite these known differences between adults and the
immature auditory systems of children, cochlear implant research has focused on adults. In adults, the most
promising methods for optimizing programming strategies include focusing the electrical field emitted by each
electrode to stimulate a more restricted population of neurons and deactivating less effective electrodes. Very
few attempts have been made to optimize programming strategies specifically for children, and recent
evidence suggests children would benefit more than adults from focused stimulation. Moreover, when new
programming strategies are implemented, there is limited data about the timecourse needed to assess their
effectiveness.
 Three aims are proposed: 1) Determine the underlying mechanisms for spectral resolution in children
and adults with cochlear implants by comparing peripheral physiological and behavioral tuning across the
lifespan; 2) Quantify short-term changes (over hours) in speech perception in children and adults when using
optimized programming strategies with selective channel deactivation with and without focused stimulation;
and 3) Quantify long-term changes (over weeks) in speech perception in children and adults using the same
optimized strategies as in Aim 2.
 The results of the proposed studies are expected to advance our understanding of how the implanted
auditory system develops, how cochlear implants should be programmed to best deliver spectrally challenging
signals, and the timecourse of acclimatization to changes in programming strategies. These findings could
guide clinical decision making about when to make programming adjustments, what types of adjustments to
make, and how long patients need to reach peak performance following adjustments. The results from these
studies could ultimately lead to improved functional outcomes for children and adults with cochlear implants."

 Bacteria communicate using the cell-cell signaling system called quorum sensing to collectively alter
gene expression in response to changes in population density and composition. Quorum sensing controls
behaviors that benefit the group for adaption and survival, including biofilm formation, motility,
bioluminescence, and toxin production and secretion. A more comprehensive understanding of how cell-cell
signaling regulates virulence and impacts bacteria in their environmental niches can lead to the development of
anti-microbial molecules that modulate quorum sensing to mitigate pathogenesis. Despite advances in
elucidating the quorum signaling inputs, comparatively less is known about the output – the transcriptional
regulation program that controls group behaviors and development in bacteria. The objective of the proposed
research is to define how bacteria use quorum sensing signaling to control virulence gene expression, using
Vibrio bacteria as established quorum sensing model systems and relevant pathogens. In Vibrio species, LuxR
is the master transcription factor and the conserved core regulator of quorum sensing genes and virulence.
Previous work identified important and highly conserved biochemical, biophysical, and genetic features of
LuxR and Vibrio quorum signaling systems that govern gene expression. Yet, the influence of quorum sensing
on numerous developmental pathways varies even among closely related Vibrio strains through means that
are not understood. The proposed research will expand upon these findings to examine gene regulation by
LuxR at the mechanistic level and then more broadly connect this information to the conservation and impact
of quorum signaling networks across Vibrio species. First, the proposed research will determine the
connections between spatial organization of the chromosome and LuxR regulation based on established
findings that nucleoid structuring proteins impinge on quorum sensing gene expression in several Vibrio
species. Second, to more broadly examine the influence of signals from “self” (quorum sensing autoinducers)
and “other” (environment), quorum sensing gene expression will be assessed at the single-cell and population-
wide level in response to variations in autoinducer signaling and nutrient availability. The proposed
microfluidics, cell culture, and host infection experiments combined with comparative genomics will provide key
links between quorum sensing signaling and Vibrio adaptation to environmental and host signals. Third, the
van Kessel lab recently developed thiophenesulfonamide inhibitors that specifically block LuxR protein function
in Vibrio bacteria. These molecules are key tools that will guide our understanding of LuxR function and inform
structure-activity modeling and inhibitor design for potential therapeutic compounds. Collectively, the proposed
research will provide fundamental data critical to understanding quorum signaling and how it impacts bacterial
pathogenesis to contribute to future advances in vibriosis disease treatment."
10894286,"Persons who experience incarceration in the United States are disproportionately impacted by HIV infection and
substance use disorders (SUD) and are at increased risk of having poor health outcomes. The time of release
from carceral settings, known as community re-entry, is a period of particularly high risk for persons with HIV
(PWH). New and creative approaches to sustaining HIV treatment and viral suppression during community re-
entry are urgently needed. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is highly effective in controlling HIV and can significantly
reduce HIV transmission. However, justice involved PWH often struggle with daily ART adherence during
community re-entry and consequently experience disease progression and contribute to HIV transmission. Long-
acting injectable (LAI) ART is a new alternative to help overcome the challenges of adhering to daily pills. The
first FDA-approved LAI ART regimen, cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), is administered by intramuscular
injection every four weeks. There is an immediate opportunity to investigate whether using LAI ART, as opposed
to daily oral ART, has a unique and important role when initiated in carceral settings and continued during
community re-entry with the goal of improving treatment outcomes. We propose a mixed methods study that will
develop and pilot test an LAI ART protocol designed specifically for community re-entry. This study will be
conducted in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Corizon
Health (state prison medical contractor), and Total Health Care, a Federally Qualified Health Center in the
Baltimore Metropolitan area, an Ending the HIV Epidemic geographic hotspot. Framed by the Behavioral Model
for Vulnerable Populations, our aims include: 1) Conduct interviews with justice and treatment experienced PWH
(n=20), and carceral and community key stakeholders (n=20), to obtain guidance on the development and
implementation of a protocol to transition PWH on oral ART to LAI ART in prison with continuation during
community re-entry. 2) Develop an initial LAI ART community re-entry protocol and conduct an open label pilot
study that will follow 10 incarcerated PWH eligible for LAI ART who are near release from prison for three months
in order to optimize protocol procedures and to pilot study retention methods and assessments. 3) Following
optimization of protocol, conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial among 50 incarcerated PWH eligible for LAI
ART and scheduled to be released from prison; participants will be randomized 1:1 to transition ART to injectable
CAB/RPV or continue daily oral ART regimen through a six-month follow-up period after release. During the
follow-up period, we will assess the primary outcome of HIV viral suppression and secondary outcomes including
continuance of the assigned LAI or oral ART regimen, ART adherence, and substance use. This study will
provide preliminary data to inform the design of a future multi-site fully powered clinical trial that will compare LAI
ART to daily oral ART during community re-entry on sustaining HIV viral suppression after release from prison."

This program will design, implement, and establish a course to teach advanced statistical methods in
neuroimaging and genetics. Over the past decade the National Institutes of Health has greatly increased funding
of grants that utilized advanced neuroimaging methods, genetic methods, and advanced statistical methods.
While introductory courses are offered, there is, however, no course offered in the United States that provides
an intensive, hands-on learning opportunity to better prepare biomedical and clinical researchers in advanced
methods. Given that the combined budgets for grants that utilize these advanced analysis techniques from the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),
National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and National Institute of Biomedical
Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB (five Institutes that greatly utilize neuroimaging and genetics), have grown
5-fold from ~250 million USD to ~1250 million USD, there is a great need to provide an educational opportunity
to ensure the workforce is well positioned to carry out important work that has been identified by these and other
institutes. This program will create the course, “Training in Advanced Statistical Methods in Neuroimaging and
Genetics”. It will bring together world-class scientists and educators in a two-week intensive format to provide
theoretical lectures paired with hands-on computer tutorials. This program will teach 20 students in the first year,
25 students in years 2 and 3, and then 30 students in years 4 and 5. These students will be accepted from all
across the United States, with attention to a diverse student cohort, ensuring enrollment of women and
underrepresented minorities. Additionally, the project will distribute Travel Awards based on financial need. The
beginning of the course will be a full-day primer on basic statistical methods and analytic infrastructure. Over
two weeks, students will learn and put into practice methods such as: hierarchical statistical models, Bayesian
statistics, network science, functional and structural connectomics, disease driven degeneration of the brain, and
methods for analysis of genetics data such as polygenic risk scoring and structural equation modeling.
The course will conclude with lectures and labs on multi-modal analysis, including multi-modal imaging analysis,
and imaging-genetics analysis, along with classification methods for biomarker development. To help students
apply the acquired knowledge and skills to their independent research projects back at their home institutes, we
will supplement the course with a continuing education portion. For the 6 months following the formal two-week
course, the students will have access to the theory lecturers on a monthly basis in a structured learning
environment. Additionally, during that 6-month follow-up period, they will also have near-real-time access
regarding technical implementation questions through the Slack messaging and collaboration platform. This
continued education portion will greatly increase success utilizing their new practical skills in their own research."

The complexity and dynamics of protein kinases and epigenetic modifications in cellular processes necessitate
the development of precise biosensors for live imaging. This proposal aims to develop single-FP-based, high-
performance, ultrasensitive biosensors through directed evolution in mammalian cells. These biosensors will be
used in multiplexed imaging and dynamic visualization of signaling activities in situ, with a specific focus on
improving chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) for cancer immunotherapy.
 Addressing the limitations of CAR-T therapy, particularly T cell exhaustion in solid tumors, requires a
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. Although kinases and epigenetic markers,
particularly H3K27me3, play key roles in T cell regulation, our understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics
during cancer-immune interactions and through the course of CAR-T cell rejuvenation remains limited due to the
absence of appropriate investigative tools. Thus, parallel examination of these key regulators in cancer-immune
interacting environments should reveal new insights into the systematic behaviors and identify essential links for
therapeutic manipulation. My hypothesis is that 1) the reversal of CAR-T cell exhaustion involves a rejuvenation
of ZAP70 and Lck kinase’s function and a reprogramming of the H3K27me3, transitioning from an exhausted
state to a naïve T cell-like state; and 2) transient knockdown of exhaustion-related genes could prevent and
reverse exhaustion of CAR-T cells, which can be reflected by the kinase and epigenetics coordinated response
patterns.
 Leveraging the combined expertise of my mentors, I have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering
single-FP biosensors for tyrosine kinases, directed evolution of single-FP biosensors in mammalian cells and
established a transient gene knockdown system that can be remotely controlled by focused ultrasound (FUS).
Building on these achievements, three distinct aims have been further proposed: Aim 1 focuses on engineering
novel single-FP prototype biosensors for monitoring tyrosine kinases or epigenetics in CAR-T cells of different
phenotypes during cancer cell engagement and establishing a multiplexed imaging platform. Aim 2 involves
developing ultrasensitive single-FP biosensors through directed evolution, high-throughput screening, and next-
generation sequencing. Aim 3 focuses on the application of these biosensors for multiplexed imaging and
manipulation of kinase-epigenome signaling in CAR-T cells using a FUS controllable gene knockdown system.
This biosensor engineering platform can potentially be extended to develop any other kinase and epigenetic
biosensors for live cell imaging. Similarly, the novel FUS-controllable gene knockdown system could be
generalized for broader manipulations of various cellular processes. Successful execution of this project could
revolutionize biosensor engineering and kinase imaging, profoundly impacting our understanding and treatment
of cancer and other diseases."
10864362,"The clinical experience with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition in ovarian cancer has been disappointing.
The poor outcomes may at least in part be due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
(TME) and the low tumor mutational burden in ovarian cancer, suggesting relatively limited immunogenicity
and anti-tumor T cell responses. These barriers may be overcome by clinically relevant combinatorial
treatments that (i) stimulate anti-tumor T cell immunity and (ii) alleviate immune suppression in the tumor
microenvironment. Favorable clinical results from a recent trial of Th17-inducing dendritic cell (Th17-DC)
vaccination in patients with stage III/IV ovarian cancer provided a strong foundation for Th17-DC vaccine-
based combinatorial approaches to immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Indeed, follow-up studies in a mouse
model of ovarian cancer showed that Th17-DC vaccination could dramatically improve responses to anti-PD-
1 immune checkpoint inhibition.
Several lines of evidence have pointed to a key role for B cell responses in the anti-tumor activity of Th17-DC
vaccination. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the efficacy of anti-PD-1/Th17-DC vaccination is
dependent on host B cell responses in the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1) Determine whether the efficacy of anti-PD-1/Th17-DC vaccination combinatorial immunotherapy is
 dependent on B cells
 We will evaluate the role of B cells in anti-PD-1/Th17-DC vaccine-induced antitumor immunity by in
 vivo depletion of B cells in the ID8 p53-/- and the ID8 p53-/- BRCA2-/- mouse models of ovarian cancer.
Aim 2) Determine whether the efficacy of anti-PD-1/Th17-DC vaccination combinatorial immunotherapy is
 associated with the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)
 We will correlate the prevalence and morphology of TLS in ID8 p53-/- and ID8 p53-/- BRCA2-/- ovarian
 tumors with therapeutic responses to anti-PD-1/Th17-DC vaccination. We will also identify TLS gene
 signatures associated with therapeutic responses.
The potential synergy between Th17-DC vaccination and anti-PD-1 may have considerable impact for the
future use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of ovarian cancer. The novel concept that the efficacy
of Th17-DC vaccination (itself an innovation), either as monotherapy or combined with anti-PD-1 immune
checkpoint inhibition, is ultimately dependent on B cell responses also has high impact for the field."
10882389,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in younger women (≤ 50 years at time of diagnosis), who comprise
approximately 19% of incident breast cancer cases. Improved survival after a breast cancer diagnosis has
focused attention on the impact of the disease and its treatments on long-term outcomes in younger women.
Studies have consistently shown that younger women have greater psychological and physical morbidity after
breast cancer than older women and age-matched women with no cancer history, including elevated levels of
depression. Depression has been linked to treatment non-adherence and predicts shorter recurrence-free and
overall survival in women with breast cancer, highlighting its clinical relevance. Younger breast cancer survivors
also report high levels of fatigue, insomnia, vasomotor symptoms, and cancer-related stress that may persist for
years after diagnosis, causing significant impairment in quality of life. There is a critical need for effective,
scalable interventions that can reduce depression and enhance long-term survivorship in this vulnerable group.
To meet this need, we will conduct a phase III randomized clinical trial testing two new digital versions of a brief
mindfulness intervention designed for younger breast cancer survivors. This study concept has been peer-
reviewed and endorsed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the NRG Oncology National Community
Oncology Research Program (NCORP) which will implement the study protocol through its network of community
and clinical sites, ensuring a broad and diverse group of participants. The Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs)
intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and improving physical and psychological well-
being in younger breast cancer survivors when delivered in person, in groups. We have developed and pilot
tested two digital versions of the intervention, one delivered live online in groups over Zoom with an experienced
instructor (MAPs live online), and the other delivered via a professionally-produced app (MAPs App). We
hypothesize that both digital interventions will be effective in reducing depressive symptoms (primary outcome)
and improving physical and psychological symptoms and work productivity (secondary outcomes) at post-
intervention and over a 6-month follow-up relative to a meditation only control group. In addition to testing
efficacy, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these programs, which is critical for payors to make coverage
decisions, healthcare providers and employers to make adoption decisions, and patients to make participation
decisions. We will also collect implementation data from study sites to inform future dissemination efforts.
Finally, we will explore potential mediators and moderators of intervention effects to determine how these
approaches work and for whom, which will facilitate targeted intervention delivery and content to those most
likely to benefit."
10875187,"Program evaluation and trainee assessment are crucial to support successful training programs
in the biomedical sciences. The updated NIGMS T32 funding mechanism identifies the critical
role of trainee-focused learning goals, aligned activities, effective evaluation and feedback in
advancing current approaches to graduate student training. Yet few training programs are
prepared to integrate evaluation into their programs and incorporate trainee-centered cycles of
improvement. We propose to develop a series of interactive content and video modules on
program evaluation that can be used synchronously or asynchronously to train faculty and lead
administrators in the biomedical sciences in effective and equitable evaluation of training
programs. We further propose to test our content in five institutions, including an HBCU, with
project-trained facilitators leading local learning communities. We will train (and pay) facilitators
at these five institutions to lead teams of training grant PI/PDs and administrators in learning
through a learning community model. The modules will build upon a set of pilot videos and
workshops on program evaluation that were developed and piloted successfully 2020-2021 with
funds from an NIH supplement to NIH 3T32GM008449-27S1 (Leonard, PI) Developing Capacity
to Evaluate Training Programs via Development of Human, Institutional and Social Capital. The
proposed modules will 1) include both introductory and advanced content about evaluation (e.g.
direct measures of trainee performance, principles of equitable evaluation, survey design, focus
group design), 2) set participants up for success by preparing them to identify and work with
evaluators, evaluation advisory boards, and cycles of improvement and 3) address issues and
concerns that are unique to evaluation of training programs in the biomedical sciences. Finally,
we will disseminate modules, facilitation training, and facilitation guides nationally."
10880935,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The goal of this research proposal is to advance molecular-level understanding of a conserved
signal transduction system that influences the ability of Brucella abortus to survive chemical and physical
stress conditions, and to colonize mammalian hosts. The general stress response (GSR) signaling system
controls stress adaptation and chronic infection in a mammalian model of brucellosis. We are working to
understand how B. abortus detects environmental signals via a set of HWE-family histidine kinases to
influence infection. We have preliminary evidence that two sensor kinases coordinately control GSR
activation and infection in B. abortus. We have further discovered that previously uncharacterized genes
regulated by the GSR system – eipB, gsrN1 and gsrN2 – are determinants of mammalian infection. These
conserved genes protect Brucella spp. from cell envelope stress and control stress-dependent gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level, respectively.
 Investigation of these genes will define the molecular underpinnings of infection in an
understudied pathogen of significant human health and agricultural import. Given that sensor histidine
kinases are not present in mammals, the basic biochemical and genetic experiments we propose here
have the potential to inform new treatments for microbial infection targeted to sensory histidine kinases.
Proposed studies will be conducted by investigators that have expertise working on this select agent
under high containment BSL3 conditions. The specific aims of this project are:
1) Define the mechanism of stress signal detection by a multi-kinase sensory system
2) Characterize the mechanism by which EipB contributes to cell envelope function
3) Determine the mechanism by which the small RNAs GsrN1 and GsrN2 regulate Brucella
 infection biology"
10882086,"ABSTRACT
COPD is the fourth leading cause of death for women in the United States, which has a strong genetic basis.
Studies have demonstrated the heritability of COPD to be ~40%. Despite the enormous burden of COPD, there
are still no pharmacologic therapies that slow progression of disease or reduce mortality, indicating the need
for a better understanding of the genetic basis of the disease.
 Notably, COPD shows sex differences in disease prevalence, pathology, and symptoms. Although
historically thought to affect primarily men, the risk of COPD in women has increased over time due to growing
prevalence of smoking and exposure to harmful pollutants. Thus, over the past decade, age-adjusted
prevalence of COPD has been consistently higher in women than in men. Moreover, women report greater
breathlessness at similar degrees of airflow obstruction and emphysema severity, and experience >25% more
exacerbations than men.
 Despite the sex differences, most omics studies of COPD combine both sexes together and large-scale female
specific COPD studies are lacking. In this application, we propose novel approaches to conduct female-specific
GWAS, borrowing strength from summary statistics from large sex-combined GWAS of COPD. We will also
generate single cell RNASeq data from female lung and integrate cell type specific eQTLs with GWAS to identify
risk genes. Besides, we will assemble a large multi-ancestry plasma proteomics dataset, generate female specific
pQTLs, and use them to identify COPD biomarkers. Results from this study will bring novel insights into the
mechanisms of COPD in females and identify protein biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis."
10882089,"The genome is inherently unstable. It is estimated that ~ 105 DNA lesions occur every day in each mammalian cell, the vast majority of which are quickly repaired. Cell stress leads to the accumulation of DNA lesions, including double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). Unrepaired DSBs are deleterious, induce genomic instability, and result in the release of nuclear DNA (nDNA) into the cytosol. The latter activates the CyDNA-sensing proteins (CDSPs), involving the CGAS-STING1 pathway, which activates IRF3 and NFkB1, the transcriptional regulators of genes involved in inflammation, senescence, cell death, and fibrosis.  In the last 3 decades, PI has focused on studying the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of hereditary cardiomyopathies, which are the genetic forms of cell stress and the prototypic forms of heart failure. Studies supported by the R01 award subject to this renewal, indicated activation of the CDSP and the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in the heart samples from patients and mouse models of lamin (LMNA)-associated cardiomyopathy (LAC). The pathogenic role of the activation of these pathways was illustrated upon deletion of the Mb21d1 gene, encoding CGAS, which prolonged survival, improved cardiac function, reduced fibrosis, and mitigated cell death in a mouse model of LAC. Moreover, for the first time, to our knowledge, PI and colleagues have identified, by END-Seq, and partially characterized genome-wide DSBs at the nucleotide level in the mouse cardiac myocytes (CMs). The team has also defined the lamin-associated domains (LADs) in mouse CMs and shown that LMNA protects the genome against DSBs. In addition, the roles of chromatin remodeler CTCF, repair protein XRCC6, and topoisomerase TOP2B in the induction and repair of DSBs have been partially defined.  We will test the hypothesis that transcription/replication stress (TRS) increases DSBs. Thus, we identify and characterize DSBs in CMs and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in two mouse models representing the human dominant- negative (LMNAD300N knock-in) and haploinsufficiency (inducible heterozygous Lmna deletion in CMs) mechanisms in LAC. We will define the roles of LADs and topographically associated domains (TADs), identified by the CTCF and SMC1A loops; TOP2B, and selected repair proteins in the DSBs generation and transcription (TRS). To test the hypothesis that LMNA regulates chromatin accessibility and hence, susceptibility to DSBs, chromatin accessibility will be assessed by ATAC-Seq, and susceptibility of the open chromatin regions (OCRs) to DSBs will be determined. Finally, the phenotypic effects of replenishing the depleted cellular NAD+ in LAC by administering -nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and deleting the Sting1 gene to reduce NAD+ use in inflammation, will be determined in the LAC mice. The complementary approaches are expected to replenish the depleted NAD+, enhance repair protein PARylation, increase OCRs, and make the DSBs accessible to the repair proteins. The findings are expected to provide novel insights not only into the molecular pathogenesis of LAC but into various pathological states, because of the ubiquitous nature of TRS in mammalian cells."
10882605,"Project Summary
In order to translate multi-modal sensory information into goal-directed behavior, both brains and artificial
neural networks construct abstract internal representations. The nature, mechanistic origin, and function of
these internal representations are currently a subject of high interest. Here we propose to investigate two
circuits in the central brain of Drosophila the allow multi-modal sensory information to be translated into goal-
directed navigation. First, we will examine the integration of optic flow, airflow, and locomotor information in the
columnar input pathway to the fan-shaped body, a part of the Drosophila navigation system. We hypothesize
that this circuit allows the fly to adapt to altered sensory input and to disambiguate sensation caused by its own
movement from that caused by external stimuli. Second, we will investigate the dynamics of chemo-sensory
and self-motion representations in local neurons of the fan-shaped body. We will test the connectome-driven
hypothesis that recurrent excitation and global inhibition interact to shape the distinct spatio-temporal dynamics
of representations in different neuron types. Finally, we will use computational approaches to investigate the
function of these representations. We will construct circuit models based on experimental data to test the
proposed function of each circuit and also examine the conditions under which artificial neural network trained
to perform ethological navigation tasks develop similar internal representations. Together these experimental
and computational investigations will yield insight into the nature, circuit origins, and function of multi-modal
internal representations."

This proposal is to continue studies aimed to understand how absorption of different nutrients is coregulated
by small intestine in health and disease. Proper nutrient absorption by gastrointestinal tract is essential for
human health; dysregulation of GI function results in a broad spectrum of human disorders and in extreme
cases, death. We have discovered an unexpected and tight relationship between copper transport and fat
absorption in both healthy intestine and in the animal model of Wilson disease (WD). We demonstrated that
copper modulates maturation and trafficking of chylomicrons, the major carriers of dietary fat, and identified
specific steps in chylomicron processing that are sensitive to copper levels. Moreover, fatty acids regulate
trafficking and localization of Cu transporters in enterocytes, providing a feedback loop. We will now identify
the molecular mechanism of this co-regulation and examine how it is altered in human disease. In Specific
Aim 1, we will characterize the role of the copper transporters ATP7A and SLC31A1 in chylomicrons secretion
by examining the effects of their intracellular localization on ApoB trafficking, lipid content, and chylomicrons
secretion. Experiments in Specific Aim 2 will elucidate how intestinal ANKRD9 senses ATP levels and
facilitates ApoB and Slc31a1 trafficking in enterocytes; this will be done by characterizing the ANKRD9
macromolecular complexes and identifying ANKRD9 ATP-sensing site(s). Specific Aim 3 will determine how
Cu misbalance impacts metabolic status of human intestine in WD by characterizing the duodenal proteomes
of non-treated and chelator treated WD patients, as well as non-WD controls. Single cell nuclear sequencing
of human WD tissue will establish how Cu misbalance impacts cell speciation in intestine and the metabolic
state of human intestine."
10883294,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. About 75% of the newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients are ≥70 years old and
have the lowest 5-year relative survival (61%) due to comorbidity and frailty. Current clinical care guidelines for
older cancer patients only partially address specific challenges experienced by them, thus resulting in large
variations and inconsistency in their standard cancer care. Evidence surrounding complications after colorectal
cancer surgery, treatment toxicity, and their impact on patients’ quality of life (QoL) in older colorectal cancer
patients is inconsistent, and relies heavily on the chronological age of the patient. Thus, there is an urgent
unmet need to evaluate predictors of clinical and patient-reported outcomes in older colorectal cancer patients
in order to aid clinical decision-making and tailor treatment regimens that coincide with patients’ level of risk,
while minimizing complications and toxicities, and improving QoL. The current project is prepared in response
to NIH NOSI NOT-CA-21-031, and will help inform the role of aging-related functional decline on various
clinical and QoL outcomes in cancer patients. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate whether
physical function (Aim 1), a multidimensional brief geriatric assessment tool (Aim 2), and pre-operative
biomarkers of aging (telomere length, mitochondrial DNA copy number), inflammation, nutritional status and a
biological aging score (Aim 3) are associated with postsurgical complications, treatment toxicity, survival, QoL,
and cognitive outcomes in geriatric colorectal cancer patients. Our central hypothesis is that outcomes in
geriatric colorectal cancer patients are associated with physical, functional, emotional, and cognitive status,
irrespective of patients’ chronological age. We propose to recruit a prospective cohort of newly diagnosed
stage I-III colorectal cancer patients (n~462) ≥70 years of age recruited ~2 weeks prior to their cancer surgery.
At study enrollment, we will assess patients’ physical function through Short Physical Performance Battery and
Handgrip testing, and administer a brief geriatric assessment tool developed by Hurria et. al. Biomarkers of
biological aging, inflammation, and nutritional status will be measured in stored blood collected prior to surgery
using well-validated assays. Associations of these exposures with surgical complications (at 30 days),
treatment toxicity, QoL and cognitive function (at 12 months), and clinical outcomes such as survival (at 24
months) will be measured. Our proposed study design is cost-effective as it builds upon a well-established
unique cohort currently recruiting colorectal cancer patients <70 years of age, the ColoCare Study. The
healthcare of older cancer patients extends beyond the traditional management of cancer, and requires
addressing the multifactorial health concerns of this expanding population, making it a significant public health
priority. Information gained in this project may ultimately inform precision geriatric oncology approaches to
improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in patients at a higher risk of chemotoxicity and death, and to
tailor risk stratification for cancer surveillance in this growing population of geriatric colorectal cancer survivors."

The PhD Program in Neuroscience at Harvard University has been a leader in the development of
innovative curricula for training in research rigor, beginning with the creation, in June 2011, of the
course ""Quantitative Methods for Biologists,"" led by Drs. Michael Springer and Richard Born. Since this
time, we have continued to develop curricula in this area, including specific instruction in research rigor
and reproducibility from a statistical perspective in the course ""Thinking about data,"" taught by Dr. Born.
We propose to extend and enhance these efforts by developing teaching materials that will address
""missing pieces"" in neuroscience curricula to reinforce research rigor: 1) identifying and eliminating
sources of bias in experimental design and analysis, 2) distinguishing experimental failures from
biological answers; 3) investigating the details and assumptions of analyses and 4) making coded
analyses reproducible. Our pedagogical approach will emphasize active learning and embedding
concepts within a specific neuroscience context to enhance student engagement, learning, and
retention. All units will feature interviews with diverse scientists to highlight the importance of the topic
and tutorials of varying difficulty focused on specific neuroscience examples. These tutorials will consist
of short animated videos to introduce key ideas, interactive visualizations, discussion questions, real
data when appropriate, and optional coding exercises, and will be available in various levels of difficulty
and assumed expertise. All units will include a “learner resources page” with summary notes, a
glossary, and pointers to further resources on the topic, as well as an instructor resources page with
sample lesson plans, assessment question banks, and downloadable content."

In 2016, we initiated the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison Summer Program in Undergraduate Urology
Research (SPUUR) to attract and retain aspiring scientists into the field. Supported by our George M. O'Brien
Center in benign urology research, and excellent mentors including NIDDK Multidisciplinary Urologic Research
(KURe) Career Development Program (K12) awardees, we trained 28 scholars. Half the scholars co-authored
at least two manuscripts and all remained in research-related positions or joined advanced degree programs.
We recruited exclusively from UW-Madison and now seek to expand scholar recruitment to the entire US. We
will support 10 students per summer. We will use proven active learning modules to introduce scholars to
research and clinical challenges from perspectives of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, Pharmacy,
Nursing and Veterinary Medicine. We believe the benign urology workforce is strengthened by diverse
perspectives. We will apply best practices in recruiting participants from traditionally underrepresented
communities. Our diversity recruitment efforts are effective and SPUUR scholars trained to date are more diverse
than the UW-Madison undergraduate population from which they were recruited. We are determined to propel
our scholars into advanced clinical and basic urologic research training programs. We will leverage a unique
UW-Madison resource, the nation's only U24 Urology Centers Interaction Core, to initiate professional networks
between scholars and faculty at urology centers throughout the country and facilitate entry into advanced degree
programs. Historically, most NIDDK-KUH-sponsored R25 Programs have had a kidney or hematologic focus.
The lower urinary tract is underrepresented and thus remains under-appreciated by prospective biomedical
research scholars. Our program will fill the void by intensively focusing on the lower urinary tract. Students will
engage in a carefully constructed curriculum to cultivate critical thinking, develop research questions, conduct
research responsibly, network virtually with peers from other summer undergraduate programs, learn about the
graduate school application process, interact with current graduate students and campus organizations
(particularly those representing students of color and other underrepresented communities), and receive one-
on-one advising from mentors experienced in developing biomedical research scholars. Our unique focus on the
lower urinary tract, our rigorous and evidence-based plan to recruit underrepresented students, our superior
faculty partners, our proven experience in summer undergraduate research programs, our learner-centered
training and educational approach, and the unparalleled UW-Madison environment and resources portend the
success of our program."
10885183,"How does our ability to detect motion develop and to what extent does sensory experience contribute? In
mice, the detection of motion begins in the retina. There, direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) fire more
action potentials in response to visual stimuli moving in one direction, called the preferred direction, than visual
stimuli moving in the opposite direction, called the null direction. In the adult retina, the preferred directions of
DSGCs cluster along 4 directions. The relative orientation of these clusters varies across the surface of the retina,
creating a direction selectivity map. The factors which underlie the development of the direction selectivity map
is unknown. Two recent experiment indicate visual experience is involved. The first is that the preferred direction
of DSGCs cluster along the axes defined by optic flow, i.e. the trajectories of apparent motion mapped onto the
retinal surface. The second is from the Feller lab showing that the clustering of DSGCs preferred directions along
the 4 axes requires visual experience. In Aim1, I present strong preliminary evidence that demonstrates that the
map is established at eye-opening and is not altered after visual deprivation, contradicting a role for activity.
 Although visual experience does not seem necessary for establishing the direction selectivity map, it may
play a role in refining it. For example, raising a mouse in an artificial environment that enriches for specific
orientations leads to an overrepresentation of cortical cells that prefer that orientation and the process is thought
to be instructive rather than permissive. Therefore, in specific aim 2, I will determine whether altered visual
experience, specifically enriched for optic flow, refines the direction selectivity map.
 Finally, in Aim 3, we explore the factors that influence the organization of the direction selectivity map
at eye opening. First, we test whether retinal waves, which are spontaneous depolarizations of retinal ganglion
cells that occur exclusively during the first two weeks of postnatal life, play a role. These waves are the primary
driver of activity before eye opening in the direction selectivity circuit and even exhibit a propagation bias toward
forward optic flow. We propose a pharmacogenetic experiments to determine whether disruption of retinal waves
alters the organization of the map. Second, we begin to explore the role of transient molecular gradients that are
expressed in the retina when the direction selectivity circuit is developing. Specifically, I provide evidence that
the EphB receptor of the ephrinB axon guidance molecule exhibits a similar distribution gradient as the dorsal-
ventral DSGC preferred directions. We will then look at maps in a mouse lacking EphB receptors in the retina."

The Neurosciences Graduate Program (NGP) at UC San Diego (UCSD) is committed to training the next
generation of neuroscience leaders. The NGP brings together world-class research institutions and laboratories
at UCSD, The Salk Institute, The Scripps Research Institute, and the Sanford Burnham Institute, to create one
of the largest and most diverse neuroscience environments in the world. The proposed training program
combines this environment with a progressive, quantitatively rigorous curriculum covering multiple neuroscience
disciplines, mentored research with world-leading investigators, collaborative opportunities across clinical and
academic settings, and mentored professional development. Research productivity and placement of prior NGP
trainees is outstanding, with most trainees continuing in scientific research and higher education. The NGP
consistently ranks among the top graduate programs in US. The proposed training program supports 1st and
2nd-year NGP students and is endorsed by strong institutional support. The program reinforces close, productive
interactions between students and faculty. Incoming students receive intensive hands-on laboratory training in a
two-week Boot Camp that provides a unique bonding experience. Students choose thesis labs after completing
the core courses and research lab rotations in the first year. Student progress is closely monitored through formal
evaluations, with individually tailored career advising and mentorship. Scientific interactions among students and
faculty are facilitated through student-run journal clubs, discussion courses, student talks, colloquia, outreach
programs, recruitment activities, and an annual retreat. The NGP has met prior goals to increase program size
by enhancing institutional support, and to strengthen recruitment and retention of underrepresented students.
Representation of URM students in the NGP is now the highest among all UCSD STEM graduate programs, and
the overall size of the program has increased by nearly 40%, to 102 PhD students, since 2012, while recruitment
and admission have remained highly competitive (applications have doubled since 2007). Our guiding mission
to develop tomorrow's leading neuroscientists is founded on rigorous skills in experimental design, statistical
methodology and quantitative reasoning. Over the next five years, the NGP has set a goal to strengthen and
comprehensively integrate the tenets of quantitative rigor, reproducibility, and research transparency into all
aspects of the training program. This includes broadening the quantitative scope of the NGP by expanding the
successful Computational Neuroscience specialization, modifying curricula, and altering mentoring practices to
anticipate future challenges for data collection, access, and analysis. Our goal is a broad interdisciplinary
neuroscience training environment that emphasizes strong quantitative skills coupled to rigorous experimental
design and statistical methodology."

relapse resulted in sleep impairment. Recent research has implicated the orexin (hypocretin) system as a critical
regulator of reinforcing processes as well as sleep-wake states, and an interplay between orexin-1 (OX1) and
orexin-2 (OX2) receptors may regulate the relationship between sleep and stimulant abuse. The working hy-
pothesis of this application is that orexin-mediated mechanisms play a major role in the interplay be-
tween methamphetamine taking, methamphetamine-associated triggers of relapse, and sleep impair-
ment. My Research Strategy is organized around three Specific Aims to be conducted in female and male rhesus
monkeys. Aim 1 (K99 Phase) will evaluate the hypothesis that experimenter-administered daytime metham-
phetamine will disrupt nighttime sleep by decreasing time spent in slow-wave (N3) sleep and rapid eye move-
ment (REM) sleep, and that OX2 receptors modulate methamphetamine-induced sleep impairment. I will inves-
tigate the effects of subtype selective orexin receptor antagonists on sleep-wake cycles using polysomnography
based on telemetric recording of electroencephalography/electromyography/electrooculography
(EEG/EMG/EOG) and quantitative behavioral observations. Aim 2 (R00 Phase) will evaluate the hypothesis that
OX1 receptors modulate the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine, whereas OX2 receptors mediate sleep
impairment in the context of methamphetamine self-administration. I will investigate the effects of subtype-se-
lective orexin receptor antagonists on i.v. methamphetamine self-administration, and sleep will be evaluated
using actigraphy. Aim 3 (R00 Phase) will evaluate the hypothesis that OX1 receptors are associated with the
relapse-like effects of methamphetamine, whereas both OX1 and OX2 receptors are involved in reinstatement-
induced sleep impairment. I will conduct reinstatement studies in animals implanted with EEG/EMG/EOG telem-
etry. I will investigate the effects of OX1 or OX2 antagonists on methamphetamine- and/or cue-induced rein-
statement, as well as on drug- and/or cue-induced sleep impairment, in monkeys self-administering metham-
phetamine. For all studies, quantitative pharmacology will be used to assess potential OX1 and OX2 receptor
interactions in mediating the effects of methamphetamine. Overall, the lack of treatments for stimulant use dis-
order and stimulant-induced sleep impairment represents a significant unmet public health need in the U.S. and
worldwide. These results may inform the potential of orexin receptor antagonists as prospective targets for the
understanding and treatment of stimulant abuse and stimulant-induced sleep impairment."

 The Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) has played an important role since 1987
as a source of human tissues for biomedical research. To this end, the overarching goal of the
Western Division of the CHTN at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (CHTN-VUMC) is to
continue to serve the scientific community by procuring and distributing adult biospecimens,
utilizing a stringent quality management program to maintain a highly efficient and productive
biorepository operation. Key aspects of this goal are the prospective customized collection of
high-quality solid tissues and biofluids with clinical annotation and the application of a rigorous
Quality Management System to all aspects of the program. Services include blood and biofluid
collection (whole vacutainers) including investigator-supplied tubes and specialized procurement
of fresh tissue for Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) in response to changing investigator
needs are proposed. In addition, preneoplastic and rare lesions will be banked to facilitate
research in tumor progression. The CHTN-VUMC will adhere to rigorous ethical standards for
protection of human subjects and patient confidentiality and will partner with the VUMC advocacy
program to engage patients and provide opportunities for participation in research. We also
propose to serve as the Informatics (IT) trans-network Coordinating Center responsible for the
second version of the “Investigators IT” system (TQII), utilizing web services (AWS hosted) and
a strong modern technologically advanced platform and ensuring adherence to IT security best
practices. In its divisional IT strategy, CHTN-VUMC will develop and integrate new business
models and novel informatics strategies to improve operational efficiency. Marketing efforts will
include initiatives to increase awareness of CHTN in the scientific community, including enhanced
use of social media, and CHTN-VUMC will actively contribute to biorepository science and
education through leadership in societies such as the International Society for Biological and
Environmental Repositories.
 CHTN-VUMC’s leadership in network IT development makes the division uniquely
qualified to continue serving as the central IT coordinating site. A robust track record of specimen
procurement and distribution, with 57,977 specimens shipped to 734 investigators over the past
5 years, highlights the capabilities of the existing CHTN-VUMC infrastructure. CHTN-VUMC
goals in the next funding period include building upon these foundational achievements to improve
efficiency and communication within the network, investigators and scientific community."
10884024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are ~24-34 nt non-coding RNAs that have
been discovered in diverse species. Repressing the expression of transposable elements via piRNAs represents
a critical defense mechanism for germ cells to maintain genomic integrity. The piRNA biogenesis largely occurs
at nuage, the amorphous electron-dense granules with no limiting membrane in the cytoplasm. One specific type
of nuage, intermitochondrial cement (IMC), is identified with uniquely clustered mitochondria and
ribonucleoproteins as “cementing material” in embryonic germ cells, postnatal spermatogonia, and early-stage
spermatocytes. RNA-binding proteins such as PIWI family members are critical for piRNA biogenesis at IMC.
Disrupting IMC formation or removing RNA-binding proteins from IMC often blocks spermatogenesis and impairs
male fertility. Notably, none of the PIWI proteins possesses mitochondrial localization signal (MLS), and thus
they must rely on other proteins to be recruited to mitochondria or to functionally communicate with IMC. However,
it remains a knowledge gap in how mitochondria recruit PIWI proteins to form IMC for piRNA biogenesis. To fill
in this gap, in this R03 project, we will reveal how ASZ1, a mitochondrion-localized germ cell-specific protein,
recruits PIWI proteins to IMC for piRNA biogenesis (Aim 1) and subsequently impacts male germ cell
development (Aim 2). Impact: Germ cells are essential carriers to pass genomic information across generations.
This process requires properly generated piRNAs to maintain germline DNA integrity. By unveiling essential
protein interactions at IMC and defining their roles in IMC construction, piRNA biogenesis, and germ cell
development, this project will generate novel knowledge about how the piRNA processing machinery is
assembled to maintain genomic integrity, and thus critically inform the mechanistic causes of male infertility
related to piRNA biogenesis for targeted therapies. Findings from this project may also lead to a novel strategy
for developing non-hormonal male contraceptives."
10886677,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The distal arthrogryposes (DA) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized
by congenital nonprogressive joint contractures associated with muscle weakness. Depending on the gene
involved and the specific mutation, inheritance is typically autosomal dominant with variable expression and
incomplete penetrance. Current clinical classification identifies eleven different discrete syndromes with several
associated with mutations in sarcomere genes including slow skeletal myosin binding protein-C (MYBPC1).
Recently, a homozygous recessive mutation in MYBPC1 was linked to a severe form of DA, lethal congenital
contracture syndrome type 4 (LCCS4). Despite the increasing association of DA syndromes with specific genetic
mutations, molecular mechanisms that underlie skeletal muscle weakness that presumably lead to disabling
contractures are poorly understood. As these mechanisms are unknown and, specifically, little is known about
how sMyBP-C regulates muscle function in vivo, current therapies are largely ineffective and relegated to
symptomatic physical therapy.
The overall long-term goal of our research program has been to define the contribution of the myosin binding
protein-C (MyBP-C) proteins in health and disease. These sarcomeric-specific proteins are known to regulate
striated muscle contractility via modulating actomyosin function. Three MyBP-C paralogs exist, namely slow
skeletal MyBP-C (sMyBP-C), fast skeletal (fMyBP-C), and cardiac MyBP-C, and encoded by separate genes.
The specific goal of this proposal is to define the physiologic mechanisms underlining how mutations in sMyBP-
C lead to muscle dysfunction and contractures. In our preliminary studies, we determined that mouse pups that
are homozygous global sMyBP-C null (Mybpc1-/-), similar to the human LCCS4 phenotype, all died within the
first day of birth and exhibited tremors secondary to muscle atrophy. We demonstrated that muscle creatine
kinase Cre- and human a-skeletal actin-Cre/Tamoxifen-mediated sMyBP-C ablation (Mybpc1fl/fl) resulted in
significant muscle weakness in postnatal and adult stages, respectively. Finally, we showed in transgenic mice
overexpressing Mybpc1Tg under the control of the human a-skeletal actin promoter that sMyBP-C replaces
fMyBP-C impairing fast muscle type function.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that sMyBP-C acts as a key regulator of striated muscle formation and
function in both slow and fast muscle types. The planned experiments will systematically define whether (i)
sMyBP-C is essential for normal formation of muscle in prenatal and perinatal stages, (ii) sMyBP-C is required
for skeletal muscle function in postnatal and adult stages, and (iii) sMyBP-C and fMyBP-C transcomplement
each other. We anticipate that addressing these key questions will drive mechanistic understanding of how
sMyBP-C regulates skeletal muscle physiology across developmental stages. Consequently, this proposal will
identify therapeutic targets to improve muscle function in those afflicted with DA diseases."

Although androgen ablation is initially effective for advanced prostate cancer treatment, resistance ultimately
develops through various mechanisms, causing patient morbidity. Systems analysis of the prostate cancer
epigenome is a genome-scale approach to understanding the under-studied epigenetic events that characterize
prostate cancer progression to the resistant state. This proposed work is an integral part of the NCI-funded
research program U54 CA217297, which focuses on studying epigenetic mechanisms exploited by hormone-
resistant cancer cells to acquire growth and invasion advantages. Dr. Qianben Wang’s laboratory has recently
performed an integrative analysis of strand specific paired-end ChIP-exo (ChIP-ePENS) and MNase-seq data
and discovered an epigenetic mechanism by which genomic and transcriptional regulation are controlled by
precise changes to nucleosome positioning within transcription factor (TF) binding sites. This represents the
latest in a series of findings that have come out of the work of the research specialist, Dr. Zhong Chen, as the
only key, senior member of the Wang laboratory. Dr. Chen facilitated this breakthrough by developing the ChIP-
ePENS assay and working with colleagues to develop a new algorithm to perform integrative analysis of ChIP-
ePENS and MNase-seq data. The intersection of these innovative techniques led to the identification of unique
footprint boundary patterns (FBPs) of TF binding that determine how nucleosomes are positioned in and around
androgen receptor (AR)-bound enhancers. Additional evidence that AR bound by anti-androgen activates
enhancers with unique FBPs suggested that this epigenetic mechanism is hijacked by hormone-resistant cancer
cells for AR redeployment under a therapeutic condition. The U54 project will determine the role of nucleosome
repositioning as well as its regulatory proteins in supporting AR redeployment for hormone-resistant prostate
cancer. Dr. Chen will be responsible for: (1) generating the high-throughput ChIP-ePENS, MNase-seq, ATAC-
seq and RNA-seq datasets from prostate cancer cells and patient tissues; (2) analyzing sequencing data and
participating in the development of computational models to assess nucleosome positioning and spacing; and
(3) performing molecular and cellular biology experiments including developing novel CRISPR-dCas9-based
editing tools to study nucleosome positioning and prostate cancer progression, and using proteomics to identify
transcription factors and chromatin remodelers regulating nucleosome positioning. He will design and utilize a
functional omics-oriented CRISPR/dCas9-based system for therapeutic prostate cancer epigenome editing,
opening up new areas of research in the Wang lab while facilitating the translation of the U54 epigenetic
discoveries into therapeutic tools and clinical benefits. The Research Specialist award would provide a stable
and ideal research environment in which to pursue his goals in genomic and epigenomic cancer research and
to open up a range of opportunities to develop targeted therapies for hormone-resistant cancers."

 Depression and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid and rank in the top ten causes of years lived with
disability. Current gold-standard treatments are effective but do not work as well as we would like, with less
than 50% experiencing long-lasting improvements. Two gold-standard behavioral interventions for depression
and anxiety include behavioral activation, focused on enhancing approach behavior towards meaningful and
reinforcing activities, and exposure-based therapy, focused on decreasing avoidance and challenging negative
expectations through exposure to anxiety-provoking cues or situations. While these interventions have
divergent approach versus avoidance treatment targets, there is currently little knowledge to guide clinical
decision-making, i.e., to inform which strategies should be provided in the frequent case of comorbid anxiety
and depression symptoms. Approach-avoidance decision-making paradigms focus on assessing neural and
behavioral responses when faced with potential rewards and threats, tapping into processes though to be
important for both anxiety and depression as well as behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy.
 For this study, we will recruit individuals reporting both anxiety and depression symptoms and
randomize them to one of three different psychotherapeutic interventions delivered in a group setting, including
(1) behavioral activation, (2) exposure-based therapy, and a non-specific therapy approach (3) supportive
therapy. Participants will complete clinical, self-report, behavioral, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) assessments before and after therapy. Clinical symptoms will also be assessed three and six months
following therapy completion. We will use a computational approach to model the different factors that may
influence one’s behavior during approach-avoidance decision-making, including drives to avoid threat versus
approach reward and confidence versus uncertainty in one’s decisions.
 This project will accomplish the following aims (1) Determine how changes in brain and behavior
responses during approach-avoidance conflict relate to changes in mental health symptoms with the different
therapy approaches, (2) Determine the degree to which baseline brain and behavior responses during
approach-avoidance conflict predict response to the different therapy approaches, above and beyond the
influence of demographics and baseline symptom severity.
 Results will have enhance our understanding of how different psychotherapy approaches (behavioral
activation, exposure-based therapy) may impact brain responses and decisions when faces with potential
reward versus threat and approach versus avoidance drives. In addition, results will have important
implications concerning the potential for a more personalized approach to psychotherapy, enhancing
knowledge of which types of therapy strategies may be most beneficial for which individuals."

Our proposed research aims to identify sex-specific genetic drivers of neuropathologic, cognitive, and
metabolic phenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease by integrating longitudinal behavioral and molecular data from
AD mice with genetic, genomic and clinical data from human cohorts. We will leverage a newly generated
mouse population that incorporates high-risk familial AD (FAD) mutations on a genetically diverse background
(BXD panel) to identify modifiers that contribute to AD resilience in this ‘humanized’ mouse population. In
parallel, we will incorporate cutting-edge single-cell omic approachs to generate a molecular atlas of human
brains from carriers of FAD mutations (in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) and non-carriers with sporadic AD. By
combining and validating analyses in both mouse and human datasets, we expect to find molecular candidates
that robustly contribute to sex-specific variation in symptoms of AD. We will further validate these candidates
using unparalleled in vivo mouse technology to not only empircally assess their role in sex-specific
mechanisms of disease, but also to evaluate sex X genotype X treatment interactions in a subset of candidates
(i.e., Apoe) to inform more personalized therapeutic approaches. The approach we propose benefits from the
enhanced discovery power and value of existing human genetics resources and novel, precision AD mouse
models across multiple institutions to investigate the mechanisms of sex differences in AD."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a huge public health problem, with last year being a historical record of drug
overdose deaths in the US, with psychostimulants being the cause of a third of those deaths. Years of addiction
research indicate that both genetic and environmental factors influence SUD development. However, as of today
there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat psychostimulant use disorder. Therefore, new approaches are needed.
Recent studies demonstrate that diet influences mental health, including SUD behaviors: diet influences alcohol
drinking and recovery from SUD among others. Despite the evidence linking diet with SUD, mechanistic insight
into how diet and the gut affect SUD development is missing. My proposal aims to elucidate the molecules and
mechanisms of gut-brain communication that modulate dopaminergic neurons and SUD-related behavior by
taking advantage of the genetic tools, fast generation time and high-throughput economy of scale of Drosophila.
To that end, I have developed a robust, quantitative assay that shows flies develop experience-dependent
amphetamine preference. I propose to identify gut to brain signaling pathways as well as dietary components
that alter dopaminergic signaling and amphetamine preference. This proposal leverages my previous knowledge
in Drosophila behavior and will provide training in SUD-related behaviors. Carrying out the career plan outlined
will enable me to achieve my long-term career goal: to become an independent investigator with a research
program focused on the role of diet as a risk factor and possible treatment for SUD."

Dietary indices and scores provide a comprehensive and robust approach for nutritional exposure assessment,
especially in relation to chronic disease risk. While dietary supplement (DS) use is very common among the
U.S. population, with over 52% of adults and 33% of children routinely taking one or more (predominantly
nutrient containing) products, no existing metrics assessed intakes from DS in addition to those from the diet.
For this reason, we developed the Total Nutrient Index (TNI), a measure designed to evaluate total usual
micronutrient intakes, inclusive of intakes from foods and DS, relative to the Dietary Reference Intakes for
eight micronutrients identified as under consumed among the U.S. population by the 2015-2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA) in the first period of this award. We examined the relative validity of the TNI
compared to biomarkers of nutritional status among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults and
determined that 1) the TNI is a useful metric for total micronutrient exposure assessment, and 2) that the TNI
yielded higher correlations with nutritional biomarkers when compared with those obtained from dietary intake
alone. However, with the emergence of the precision nutrition era, understanding how unique combinations of
nutrients and specific amounts of these nutrients can optimize the nutritional and health status of different
population subgroups is of utmost importance. Accordingly, in the present competing continuation proposal, we
intend to update the TNI to accommodate a life stage approach, to utilize machine learning techniques to
identify critical nutrients and in what combinations optimally benefit the health and nutrition of individuals
across the life course, and relate the TNI to risk factors, health outcomes, and mortality. In Aim 1, we plan to
develop and validate the TNI-2, an updated extension of the TNI that is tailored to different life stages and

Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is experienced by millions in the United States (US), with highest
prevalence in older adults, leading to disability. An approach to attain improvement in diagnosis and treatment
that has gained momentum over the last decade is to increase understanding of the neural underpinnings of
chronic pain by looking at the associated brain changes. Biomarkers of healthy brain aging, derived from machine
learning (ML) models that map MRI patterns to chronological age, offer a look at these pathological changes
since deviations from healthy brain aging indicate potential underlying pathologies. The Predicted brain Age
Difference (PAD; predicted brain age minus chronological age), proposed as a biomarker of disease, was found
to be higher with the presence, and positively correlated with the severity, of MSK pain. However, because it is
based on a ‘global’ brain age measure, the PAD is limited to signal a ‘poorer health’ state without specifying the
type of underlying pathology. This project proposes to develop novel spatially distributed brain age measures
(brain age maps) able to capture the brain atrophy signature of different MSK conditions like chronic back pain,
osteoarthritis and neck or shoulder pain. These brain age maps will be obtained from T1-weighted MRIs via very
innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that fuse local and global mechanisms of contextual
information in the image using the so-called “transformers”. The project then proposes to develop biomarkers
specific to these MSK types informed by the brain age maps via CNNs and the so-called “vision transformers”,
a cutting-edge methodology ideal for image classification. By accomplishing these goals, this project will reveal
useful information about distinct neurobiological mechanisms of different MSK types and their determinants (e.g.,
aberrant sensory testing or resting functional networks), and how brain age is associated to the multidimensional
experience of pain. This could be particularly useful to understand the causes of the high MSK prevalence in
older adults. For example, the highest MSK prevalence in older adults might be the consequence of a more
‘natural’ accelerated brain aging, in contrast to more ‘insult-like’ causes in younger adults. Thus, the project also
aims to investigate possible age-related differences in PAD maps of MSK. Finally, we evaluate the brain age
maps’ ability prognosticate chronic pain chronification and pain-related functional decline. This proposal is
powered by the tens of thousands of participants with MRI and pain data in the UK Biobank and leverages the
University of Florida’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Initiative, endowed with one of the most powerful high
performance computing infrastructures across universities in the US. With this significant study, the applicant
pursues an independent career as an expert in ML/AI methodologies to be used to identify novel pain and brain
aging biomarkers. He will also boost his understanding of experimental pain and of the neurobiological
mechanisms of pain and aging. He will leverage strong institutional support, stellar mentorship in pain, aging and
AI, a thriving collaborative AI network, and powerful computing resources."

Research: Cancer screening disparities in Chinese immigrant women (CIW) is an understudied area of health
equity. CIW are underserved and face several system-, provider-, and patient-level barriers to healthcare.
Colorectal (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) are the main causes of preventable cancer death in CIW. While
screening is effective in reducing mortality from these cancers, CRC and BC screening uptake by CIW is
substantially lower than in other groups and well below Healthy People 2030 benchmarks. The purpose of this
study is to develop and evaluate a multi-component, community-based intervention (‘Chi gung’) in CIW by
adapting the Filipino Health Study, an NCI Evidence-Based Cancer Control Program improving CRC screening
in Filipino Americans. Our specific aims are to: 1) Develop Chi gung by adapting and enhancing the Filipino
Health Study to support CRC and BC screening in CIW and 2) Conduct a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility
and preliminary impact of Chi gung on CRC and BC screening in CIW. To accomplish these aims, we will
employ a community-engaged design. Qualitative findings from focus groups with community stakeholders and
individual interviews with CIW will guide the development of Chi gung, which will be iteratively refined through
additional semi-structured interviews and evaluated for feasibility and preliminary impact in a pilot RCT.

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating brain disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline,
affecting millions worldwide. The intricate interplay between lipid metabolism and AD pathology is increasingly
recognized, and brain lipoproteins (BLps) are thought to be key players given they serve as the primary lipid
transport vehicles in the central nervous system (CNS). BLps reside in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes
the brain but unfortunately, due to their low abundance and limited accessibility, a comprehensive understanding
of BLps has remained elusive. We developed a fluorescent lipoprotein profiling (FLP) technology that hurdles
this abundance problem to deeply characterize BLps in small volumes of CSF. Using our FLP and mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we revealed that BLps consist of a spectrum of discretely sized subpopulations that
exhibit remarkable proteomic diversity. We posit that the dominant organizing scaffold on BLps, apolipoprotein
(APO)E, acts as a master regulator of BLp composition by adopting distinct structural conformations to facilitate
docking with complementary partners that impart unique functions. APOE has three isoforms—E2, E3, and E4
differentiated by cysteine-arginine mutations at residues 112 and 158 and carriers of APOE4 have increased
amyloid plaque burden, and substantially increased lifetime risk for developing AD. We hypothesize that
conformational differences between APOE isoforms alter BLp compositional signatures and their ability to bind
and traffic amyloid beta (Aβ), the building block of amyloid plaques. Our objectives are two-fold: First, to assess
the impact of APOE isoforms on BLp distribution, composition, and ability to bind Aβ. To do so, we will perform
a comparative analysis of BLp patterns in individuals with different APOE genotypes and levels of cognitive
health using our FLP and LC-MS/MS, shedding light on the AD-relevant BLp subspecies. Second, we aim to
unravel the structural details of lipid-bound APOE isoforms that govern their interactions with Aβ. Using cryo-EM
and novel structural proteomics approaches, we will derive high-resolution structural maps of Aβ complexed with
different APOE isoforms on reconstituted HDL and determine how “accessory” proteins found on BLps modulate
their interaction with Aβ. These studies will provide a detailed molecular map of BLp metabolism in the CNS
which can be leveraged for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to treat and prevent AD."

Despite significant progress in improving child survival, sub-Saharan Africa continues to have some of the
worst outcomes for children’s physical growth and early childhood development. This is driven in large part by
elevated risks for children living in low-income urban communities. Whereas research has focused on
environmental factors, socioeconomic status and access to services, much less effort have gone into
understanding how rapid social transformation in marriage and the role of kin impacts children’s well-being in
these communities. In this project, we build on the success of an NICHD R21 project to develop and test the
Kinship Support Tree (KST) to assess quantity and quality of support from kin to single mothers and their
children in a slum context in Nairobi, Kenya. The proposed mixed methods, the longitudinal study develops a
new measure of union formalization to examine the relationships among kinship support, union formalization
and infant/child development outcomes. The union formalization measure will capture the process of
recognizing unions socially and/or legally. The study will be carried out in the same site as the KST project.
The site hosts a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) which facilitates initial sample selection
and provides strong infrastructure. We will conduct rigorous cognitive testing to finalize the questions on union
formalization, validate existing relationship quality scales and pretest all instruments in the first year to inform
the survey development. We will then start with 1250 children ages 0 – 24 months with mothers aged 18-29
and collect data on the children, mothers and selected kin two times per year over 3 years. Data on kin include
geospatial indicators of residence and distance and multiple domains of kinship support. This will be
supplemented with qualitative follow up once a year on a subsample of mothers, biological fathers, and current
partners. Our analysis will focus on the direct effects of union formalization and kinship support on child
outcomes as well as on a set of intermediate outcomes known to be associated with child development. We
will use cross-lagged structural equation and growth models to examine the effects of union formalization and
kinship support on children’s physical growth and early child development (ECD) over time. We will also
assess the extent to which union formalization moderates the effect of kinship support on physical growth and
ECD outcomes and kinship support mediates the effect of union formalization on physical growth and ECD
outcomes. We will use moderated mediation models to accomplish this. The ultimate goal of the study is to
identify models of family support that offer optimum protection for vulnerable mothers and young children."

The over 6 million Americans with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are
particularly vulnerable to burdensome, low-quality, and costly care at the end of life. Research
has highlighted the need to increase the use of palliative care in patients with ADRD as they
have needs (e.g., symptom burden) equal to those of advanced cancer patients but are much
less likely to receive palliative care. Hospice is a component of palliative care usually delivered
at the very end of life. An innovative model of hospice delivery exists, termed concurrent care,
where hospice is delivered alongside usual medical care capitalizing on the benefits of an
integrated approach. Concurrent care seems effective at enhancing outcomes in patients with
advanced cancer, however, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding the impact of
concurrent care among persons with ADRD. Understanding the impact of concurrent care on
patient and family outcomes can provide opportunities to improve the quality of end-of-life (EOL)
care and to inform future health policy. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that modifiable
organizational and clinician characteristics and care processes are associated with increased
use of concurrent care and that concurrent care is associated with high-quality end-of-life care
for persons with ADRD. We will address this hypothesis using a mixed-methods, concurrent
triangulation study design using both quantitative and qualitative methods in the Veterans
Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Aim 1 will determine temporal trends in concurrent care and the
patient, facility, and market characteristics (including regional patterns in care intensity and
hospice resources) associated with increased use of concurrent care, Aim 2 will determine the
association of concurrent care with patient and family-centered outcomes using a cross-
temporal propensity score matching difference-in-difference approach, and Aim 3 will focus on
family members of ADRD patients and their clinicians’ EOL care experiences using qualitative
methods. The results of this proposal will be impactful because we will identify modifiable
factors as targets for clinical and policy interventions to improve the quality of EOL care in
ADRD. Our mixed-methods approach will allow us to better understand contextual factors that
influence EOL care quality and the use of concurrent care to inform future palliative care and
decision-support interventions. This study will provide important policy-relevant information on
concurrent care outcomes relevant to the mission of the National Institutes of Aging to support
research concerned with the quality and continuing care of patients with ADRD and their
families."

Alcohol misuse remains a pervasive public problem, especially among young adult college students.1-3 An
increasingly popular alcohol harm reduction intervention approach involves teaching and encouraging students to
use alcohol Protective Behavioral Strategies (PBS).4-5 Despite evidence that such intervention approaches have
modest effects on drinking-related outcomes 6-7 and that PBS may not have the same degree of implementation and
effectiveness across all drinking contexts,8-9 no studies have examined the utility of and willingness to use PBS
across actual risky drinking contexts. This gap is concerning given that the success of PBS interventions relies on
the premise that the strategies will be implemented and effective when used to reduce alcohol-related harms.
Guided by social-cognitive theory and empirical work, the aims of the proposed multi-site project
are to identify which PBS are most likely to be used and why students might or might not use
these strategies in risky drinking contexts by employing a mixed-method quantitative and
qualitative approach. The present proposal objectives are to (1) identify the PBS that male and female college
students most commonly use across drinking contexts; (2) test the link between use of these identified PBS and
typical and context-specific risky drinking behaviors and alcohol-related consequences; and (3) identify perceived
effectiveness and determine the reasons why students choose to use or not use certain PBS across specific drinking
contexts. Study 1 involves collecting survey data from 500 college students (50% female) to assess PBS use, and
drinking behaviors (i.e., use/negative consequences) in general and across two risky drinking contexts—when
playing drinking games (DG)10-13 or while pregaming (PG).14-15 For Study 2, we will recruit a stratified random
sample of 40 college students (50% female) from the first study to participate in a qualitative interview.
Participants will complete a semi-structured interview that builds on quantitative responses about PBS use and
elicits reasons for using or not using specific PBS, in general, when playing DG, and while PG, and perceived
effectiveness of PBS in these contexts. Study 1’s analyses will unpack group behaviors and trends so we can identify
the most relevant PBS across contexts and by sex. Study 2’s qualitative analyses will allow us to gain a more
nuanced understanding of the barriers and facilitators to using PBS across contexts that are identified in Study 1.
By understanding (a) the contexts in which PBS are used and associated with reduced alcohol consumption and
risk for harm, and (b) the underlying reasons for their use/non-use and the facilitators/barriers to using these
strategies across contexts and by sex, the field will gain the knowledge needed to further investigate context-based
PBS use and to develop more successful evidence-based PBS interventions that best reduce alcohol-related harms
for college students. Together, the results from the proposed multi-site project will help to achieve our long-term
goal of identifying effective tools for reducing alcohol-related harms in young adult college students, fully
consistent with NIAAA objectives16 and the CollegeAIM initiative."

The broad objectives of this K08 proposal are (1) to facilitate the development of necessary skills that will allow
the PI, Dr. Adam Lin, to achieve his long-term goal of becoming a successful physician-scientist focusing on
bridging immune-based nanotechnology for the treatment of lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies,
and (2) to investigate the anti-lymphoma immune mechanisms and pathways caused by the photothermal
therapy platform. This proposal concerns evaluating a new therapy platform designed for relapsed/refractory B
cell lymphomas, which are clinically challenging to treat especially relapsing after autologous stem cell transplant
or chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or bispecific
antibodies have limited efficacy due to the suppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immune
suppressive conditions. Therefore, methods that alter local and systemic immune microenvironments are needed
to improve the response to immunotherapies. Radiation therapy (RT) has been described as altering the immune
microenvironments in lymphoma that generate a systemic immune response. However, this phenomenon has
not been observed clinically. Conversely, photothermal therapy (PTT) generates a strong T-cell response in
solid malignancy models by promoting a pro-inflammatory T-cell landscape. PTT is created by irradiating
specially designed gold nanoparticles with near-infrared light. The nanoparticles absorb the light and transfer the
energy into heat, leading to very localized ablations. We designed a PTT platform using branched gold
nanoparticles to carry toll-like receptor 9 agonists, CpGs, as an immune stimulant and found that PTT with CpGs
increased an anti-lymphoma systemic response, including increases in memory T cells. Therefore, we
hypothesize that our PTT/CpG platform can create a strong anti-lymphoma T cell response that can synergize
with immune-based treatments. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) characterize
the anti-lymphoma immune mechanism of PTT/CpG in B cell lymphoma models, (2) determine the synergistic
anti-lymphoma effects of PTT/CpG combined with T cell enhancing immune-based treatments in lymphoma
models, and (3) determine the anti-lymphoma efficacy of a subcutaneous lymphoma lysate/nanoparticle mixture
PTT platform in lymphoma models. The candidate and his mentors, Dr. Kim and Dr. Gordon have designed a
detailed training plan tailored to the candidate’s specific needs and goals. The plan includes a rigorous research
component that will afford the PI new knowledge and research skills to examine the PTT/CpG platform better
and move this concept to clinical trials. The success of this proposal will propel additional work evaluating the
combination of PTT with cellular therapies and will lead to translation into clinical trials in lymphoma with the PTT
device. Most importantly, it will provide an effective option for our patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas."

Weight gain is disproportionately high among young adults (YAs) with average weight gain of 30 lbs. occurring
between ages 18-35 and is associated with an early worsening of CVD risk factors. Primary prevention of
weight gain is important because weight loss is difficult to achieve, access to programs is limited, and initially
successful people regain weight over time. Weight gain is a serious problem in the Department of Defense, our
nation’s largest employer, with more employees than Walmart or Amazon. The military, comprised largely of
YAs, has growing rates of obesity and yearly weight gain. Many people believe that young, active-duty men
and women are fit, lean, and healthy because of the military lifestyle and protected from obesity. Unfortunately,
obesity rates in active U.S. military personnel have mirrored those of civilians. Furthermore, inability to
maintain a healthy weight results in early discharges and threatens the readiness of well-trained Airmen to be
deployed. Overweight in the military is now considered a threat to national security. Few weight gain
prevention (WGP) trials have been done in military populations, and previous trials with YAs have mixed
results and poor external validity. Our proposal is designed to address the major public health problem of
weight gain in the military, as well as address notable gaps in pragmatic mHealth and WGP trials. The SNAP-
M intervention will be adapted, with partners and key stakeholder from the US Air Force, from our evidence-
based WGP intervention for YAs, the Study of Novel Approaches to weight gain Prevention (SNAP). SNAP
tested 2 self-regulatory interventions in 599 general population YAs and found that both reduced weight gain
over 2-3 years compared to controls. This project proposes to make 1) critical adaptions to SNAP to facilitate
translation and 2) conduct a Pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness Trial of the SNAP-M intervention using a
2-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in 454 Air Force Airmen recruited from 4 military installations
with the primary outcome of mean weight change from baseline to 2 years. We will compare the groups on key
outcomes and examine potential moderators of treatment effect. Additionally, we will apply a RE-AIM
Framework to determine reach and representativeness, and potential for organizational-level adoption,
implementation, and maintenance of SNAP-M, if successful. The proposed research fills key research gaps in
an underserved population in critical need of weight gain prevention with completely remote delivery suitable
for YAs in the military."

With increasing rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, there is an urgent need to assess the
impact of household, agricultural, and industrial chemicals on neurological development. Conventional rodent
testing is costly and time-consuming, hindering widespread adoption. This study aims to develop a
high-throughput and sensitive screening platform for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing, making it
accessible to manufacturers, agricultural users, waste generators, and local governments. The results of
expanded DNT testing could inform governmental policies, improve environmental clean-up efforts, and guide
the development of safer alternatives to neurotoxic chemicals.
Current methods rely on treating rat mothers during pregnancy and lactation, limiting testing to a fraction of the
thousands of chemicals present in the environment. Moreover, these methods may not detect subtle effects on
synapse formation and circuitry performance. To address these limitations, this study proposes the ToxiFin
platform, utilizing the zebrafish model for cost-effective and high-fidelity DNT screening. This platform
incorporates automated screening and analysis methods to efficiently provide endpoints relevant to circuit
formation, circuit function, and brain organization.
Aim 1 focuses on developing a high-throughput screen for neural circuit formation by engineering a transgenic
zebrafish line with bioluminescent signals when synapses are formed. Aim 2 aims to develop an efficient and
scalable screen for assessing developmental neurotoxic effects on neural circuit function and central nervous
system organization. This will be achieved through screening behaviors associated with neurodevelopmental
health, from embryo to adult stages.
The proposed platform has the potential to assess a broader range of chemicals for DNT, diversify endpoints
for detection, and enable effective risk assessment, regulation, and intervention strategies. By utilizing the
zebrafish model, this study offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to conventional rodent testing
methods, with implications for public health and environmental protection."
10884846,"This “direct to Phase II” project, proposed in response to RFA-ES-23-008 “Novel Approaches for Developmental
Neurotoxicity Testing (R43/R44)”, will develop a suite of in vitro assays to test compounds for potential
developmental neurotoxic (DNT) effects. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs, including autism spectrum
disorder, intellectual disabilities, attention-deficit/hyperactivity and others) affect at least 15% of people in the
USA, appear in childhood/early adulthood, and cannot be cured. NDs originate from dysregulation of brain
development during early life (fetal, neonatal, and childhood), during which the developing CNS is particularly
vulnerable to environmental toxicants and many of these chemicals have been linked to NDs (e.g., mercury,
pesticides, air pollutants). In the past, such compounds have been investigated for ND effects, via
epidemiological studies, only after they cause neurotoxicity to adults; this approach has tragic, global,
consequences, since decades of research are required to establish the links between adult neurotoxicity and
DNT, during which thousands of children become impaired through exposure to the culprit toxicant. Our project
will develop standardized, high throughput, assays to test chemicals for such effects. The DevNeuroToxAssay
(DNTA) suite will include assays to test compounds for effects on neurogenesis, a key processes in early brain
formation (DNTA-Neurogenesis), on neuronal circuit formation/activity, relevant to neuronal circuits within the
brain (DNTA-Neurocircuitry), on development of 3-D neural organoids, (DNTA-Neural Organoids), and on
development and function of the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from toxicants and
pathogens (DNTA-BBB). The DNTA assays will feature neurons, glial, and support cells derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells, cultured in either 2-D or 3-D configurations. Automated digital microscopy will be
used to quantify effects of chemicals on biomarkers and structures (high content analysis, HCA); additionally,
effects of compounds on biological neuronal circuits will be quantified via collection/analysis of digital movies
(frame rates up to 100 frames per second, using Kinetic Image Cytometry, [KIC]). Compounds from the National
Toxicology Program DNT chemical library will be used to develop, validate, and demonstrate the utility of the
DNTAs. Since the DNTAs will feature human cells, the results obtained will be more predictive of human
outcomes vs. tests conducted on animals or animal cells. Vala Sciences Inc. has recently developed similar
assays to test candidate anti-HIV therapeutics for neurotoxicity, and this previous experience will expedite rapid
development of the DNTAs."
10886577,"ABSTRACT
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a well-established role in regulating blood pressure in the periphery.
ACE is also expressed in the brain, with high levels in the striatonigral pathway formed by medium spiny
projection neurons that express the Drd1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs). We have found that ACE degrades an
unconventional enkephalin heptapeptide, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF), in the nucleus accumbens of mice.
Captopril, a prototypical ACE inhibitor used to manage hypertension, enhances extracellular levels of MERF in
the nucleus accumbens. The resulting enhancement of mu opioid receptor activation by MERF causes a cell
type-specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto D1-MSNs. This mechanism of action has great
therapeutic potential, as our preliminary data indicate the decrease in excitatory drive to D1-MSNs can diminish
the rewarding effects of fentanyl. However, neither captopril nor modern ACE inhibitors routinely used in the
clinic have been optimized to regulate endogenous opioid signaling. For example, MERF may be specifically
degraded by the catalytic N-domain of ACE, whereas most clinically-approved ACE inhibitors have greater
selectivity for the catalytic C-domain of ACE. There is thus a need to identify optimal chemical entities that inhibit
MERF degradation by ACE in brain tissue. The goal of this project is to identify new compounds that inhibit ACE
and regulate endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens. In AIM 1, we will screen a selected
library of ~2,000 small molecules for domain-selective inhibition of recombinant ACE protein. This will
include candidate molecules drawn from rationally selected libraries using a pharmacophore-based approach,
as well as molecules with diverse chemical scaffolds identified through a virtual screen. In AIM 2, we will
validate the domain selectivity and efficacy of lead compounds on MERF degradation in nucleus
accumbens tissue. This will include direct measurement of extracellular MERF using liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry, as well as whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure functional effects on
excitatory input to D1-MSNs. These experiments will include knockout mice to test the necessity of each catalytic
domain of ACE in MERF degradation, as well as the involvement of mu opioid receptor signaling in physiological
changes. In AIM 3, we will evaluate the ability of lead compounds to attenuate fentanyl reward and
reinforcement. This will include measurement of fentanyl-conditioned place preference and intravenous self-
administration of fentanyl. At the conclusion of these experiments, we expect to identify chemical motifs that may
serve as leads to generate novel ACE inhibitors that block MERF degradation in the nucleus accumbens. We
may observe a double-dissociation between catalytic domains of ACE that degrade angiotensin (C-domain) and
MERF (N-domain), raising the exciting possibility of selectively manipulating endogenous opioid signaling in the
brain while avoiding cardiovascular side-effects in the periphery. Our results may also reveal that central ACE
inhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit, while mitigating risk of abuse/addiction."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease that selectively affects certain regions of the
brain, e.g. locus coeruleus, entorhinal and hippocampus. Factors underlying this selective vulnerability (SV)
remain unclear: Why is progression so stereotyped? Why is pathology seen in specific structures at early stages?
What about certain cells makes them susceptible to AD? Current hypotheses have focused on specific features,
e.g. cytoarchitecture, cell morphology, neurotransmitter system or molecular composition. The concept of cellular
vulnerability (“SV-C”) has gained currency due to advances in single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics.
Another vulnerability relates to network-based trans-neuronal “prion-like” transmission of pathology, due to
which certain circuits, fiber pathways and regions (network hubs) may become selectively vulnerable (“SV-N”).
This proposal will quantitatively test and validate hypotheses regarding SV-C and SV-N: 1) Protein aggregation,
clearance and transmission on the network underly the spatiotemporal progression of pathology; hence SV of
certain regions (e.g. EC and Hipp) may simply be a result of their location within the network topology.
Alternatively, 2) SV is dictated by distribution and composition of certain neural cell types (e.g. large pyramidal
neurons) that are selectively targeted by AD pathology. Beyond these are competing hypotheses is the possibility
that both factors combine: 3) Pathology is governed by network transmission, but whose local and spread
parameters are mediated by certain cell types (e.g. microglia). Unfortunately, AD research has so far been unable
to fully test between these hypotheses or to identify which of these vulnerabilities are germane. Much of available
bench, animal or human data are descriptive and do not accommodate quantitative models.
We propose to develop network models for SV-C and SV-N and formal statistical models to test them. We
capitalize and build on two enabling technologies that have recently come out of our laboratory: Matrix Inversion
and Subset Selection (MISS) algorithm for creating whole-brain cell type maps; and Network Diffusion Model
(NDM) which mathematically recapitulates transmission of tau along fiber projections. With further development
of these enabling technologies, we will explore SV-C and SV-N in mouse tauopathy data. We will also develop
and test models where cells or genes mediate network vulnerability indirectly. If successful this project could
lead to conclusive evidence for or against each of the identified SV hypotheses. We will explore in future work
the morphological, molecular or electrophysiological properties of short-listed cells, genes, neural pathways and
network epicenters. Concurrently and independently, we will extend the approach to humans, by developing
novel MISS algorithm suitable for human gene expression, and analogously develop mathematical models of
human connectome-driven tauopathy progression. Our approach could become a computational test bed for
future hypothesis generation and testing, without requiring expensive and laborious experiments. Proposed
platform technologies (MISS and NexIS) may have even broader applicability in neuroscience."

The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) direct key signaling processes in obesity and at least 70 other diseases.
However, focus on this signaling node alone has not achieved the promise of predictable angiogenic control. Current models
are incomplete as other growth factors, besides VEGF, contribute to vascular disease progression, presenting a complexity
that cannot be predictably regulated by targeting one node in this system. Therefore, there is a continuing need to account
for the complexity of additional, multi-component signaling networks, a goal that can be achieved via data-driven,
computational systems biology in close concert with experimental analysis of signaling and functional response.
Toward this goal, we aim to examine a novel paradigm of network regulation called cross-family signaling, in which
members from one growth factor family [e.g., platelet derived growth factors (PDGFs)] bind to and signal through members
of another family (e.g., VEGFRs). We hypothesize that systematic examination of protein structure and downstream
signaling within the cross-family paradigm via simulation, ligand-engineering, network quantification, and computational
modeling can uncover novel mechanisms to control angiogenesis. We will test this hypothesis through three aims,
sensitively quantifying receptor activation rates and functional responses of cross-family binding (e.g., proliferation,
migration, and barrier function); predicting and measuring the structural properties of cross-family binding via molecular
simulations and directed evolution; and developing validated deterministic models (mass-action kinetic modeling) of cross-
family signaling and applying them to study and control the dynamics of cross-family signaling in human cell systems, in
silico.
We are primed to lead this new research because we are among the first to pursue this important theoretical paradigm, and
we lead this cause to understand cell signaling via structure/function–based computational modeling. This work will
catalyze a shift in perspective and innovation in the areas of cell signaling, systems biology, and predictive design of obesity-
focused therapies."
10887785,"A pervasive, persistent challenge faced by traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors is a significant disturbance in
cognition across the spectrum of injury severity. Normal complex cognitive processes require optimal functioning
of neuronal networks. When the brain undergoes stress (e.g., ischemia, Alzheimer’s related neurodegeneration,
TBI), heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced to assist in protein folding, degradation and other functions. HSPs,
also called chaperones, function to maintain cellular proteostasis through dynamic protein complexes called
chaperomes to aid in protein folding, activation, degradation or disaggregation, molecular chaperoning and
translocation in normal cells. These interactions aren’t based on monomeric protein expression, but rather
through the strength and number of interactions. Under conditions of cellular stress, the chaperomes become
biochemically ‘rewired’ to form a network of pathologically stable, high-molecular-weight complexes, recently
called the epichaperome. As critical hub proteins, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and heat-shock cognate 70
(HSC70) are the central proteins involved in the pathological formation of the epichaperome and are linked
together by HSP-organizing protein (HOP). Once HSP90 and HSC70 are biochemically altered into the
epichaperome epicenter, importantly, these proteins both lose their normal physiological function of proper
protein production and also recruit a wide range of co-chaperones into the scaffold, perpetuating pathological
progression. It has recently been demonstrated in Alzheimer’s Disease and in various cancer models that the
epichaperome is responsible for the disturbance of protein-protein interaction networks, which ultimately become
dysfunctional and drive the pathological phenotype of the disease. It is currently unknown if TBI results in the
formation of epichaperome responses. Our preliminary data demonstrate that there is significantly increased
high molecular weight expression of HSP-90 and HSC-70, indicative of increased assembly of the maladaptive
epichaperome complex, in male and female rats at both acute and sub-acute time-points after controlled cortical
impact (CCI). These epichaperome-mediated protein network changes have been identified and therapeutically
targeted. PU-AD is an oral, brain-permeable epichaperome inhibitor, which targets the slow kinetics of HSP90
specifically within the epichaperome without altering monomeric HSP90 protein expression and normal function.
Preliminary data indicate that systemic administration of PU-AD attenuates cognitive deficits after CCI. The
overall goal of the project is to provide proof-of-principle that TBI produces an epichaperome response and that
disassembling the epichaperome via PU-AD improves learning and memory. The first aim will provide a
comprehensive assessment of key chaperome components that participate in the formation of the epichaperome
after TBI across brain regions and time-points. The second aim will evaluate a dose response and treatment
window of PU-AD in TBI looking at epichaperome and neurobehavioral outcomes. Since PU-AD is approved for
clinical trial for AD, a pathway for clinical translation exists for TBI."
10890603,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer risk assessment governs decisions across a spectrum of local-regional disease from whether to
biopsy to whether to intensify treatment using multimodality therapy. RNA transcript-based signatures have
rapidly been incorporated into such determinations, along with Gleason Score (now termed Grade Group or GG).
The significance of the proposed work is that there is a pressing need for optimization and standardization of
preanalytic conditions for determination of highest GG and expression of Prostate Transcripts of Aggressiveness
(PTAs), especially when working with biopsy biospecimens. These preanalytic variables extend from tissue
procurement to preservation of transcript marker integrity such that appropriate risk is assigned for each patient.
Obtaining prostate biopsies with multiparametric (mp) MRI-guidance has rapidly gained acceptance but there is
little information about how prostate mpMRI contributes to the preanalytic variables that must be recognized and
managed in clinical trials and clinical practice. There are considerable variances in the location and number of
prostate biopsies collected and in the handling of the tissue from fixation to embedding to processing for testing
of PTAs. As transcriptomic tests become more incorporated into clinical trials and practice, the tolerance of an
assay for routinely encountered preanalytic variables must be considered in the formalization of standard
operating procedures (SOPs). We will evaluate mpMRI targeted prostate biopsy specimens obtained from
patients enrolled in five existing clinical trials in which the MR images are interpreted using both the standard-of-
care reporting system for prostate (PIRADSv2.1) and a more advanced, automated, and portable quantitative
mpMRI pixel by pixel-based scoring system termed the “Habitat Risk Score” (HRS). While PIRADS provides a
critically important framework for prostate mpMRI image acquisition and interpretation, it is limited by reader
subjectivity and variability in defining biopsy regions. In this project the impact of refined prostate biopsy
procurement is paired with delineation of tissue processing variables for the classification of the most aggressive
prostate cancer attributes defined by GG and PTAs. The Decipher Genomic Classifier (GC) score is
representative of PTAs incorporated into signatures and is routinely used in clinical practice, is included in current
NCCN recommendations, and is part of a combined GG/GC risk model (Spratt model). Our proof-of-principal
studies on the impact of preanalytic variables examine highest GG and GC score, as well as effects on >400
PTAs. We hypothesize that mpMRI HRS directed tissue procurement will result in tissue more representative of
prostate cancer risk, as determined by combined GG/GC score, as compared to tissue procurement directed by
mpMRI PIRADS suspicion scores (Aim 1), that GG/Decipher GC risk will be adequately defined by 2 cores, as
compared to 4 (Aim 2) and that the definition of preanalytic processing variables and revised analytic methods
will result in improved integrity of PTAs (Aim 3)."
10890653,"The emergence of microbes resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics represents a serious threat to
global public health. The coordinated action of the bacterial machinery of peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis, a
process essential for bacterial viability, represents an obvious target for the development of new antibiotics.
In this proposed project, we aim to define the molecular interactions of the components of the PG degradation
apparatus, consisting of enzymes involved in glycan chain hydrolysis or modification. Our previous studies in
Neisseria meningitidis showed that targeting a hot spot on a single lytic transglycosylase (LgtA) also disables
the function of the PG-modifying enzyme, Ape1, leading to a disruption of PG assembly, and results in an
aberrant peptidoglycan composition, making this pathogen unable to survive in the host. Our studies will
reveal, in molecular detail, how these peptidoglycan degrading enzymes work in concert to assemble the
bacterial cell wall. Specifically, we will define, in a comprehensive way, how a network of lytic
transglycosylases (LtgA, LtgD, LtgE) and their protein binding partners work to facilitate peptidoglycan
degradation and the insertion of organelles into the bacterial cell envelope. In this project, we will utilize
biochemical and biological approaches to probe protein-protein and enzyme-substate interactions of the
various lytic transglycosylases, combined with determination of the molecular basis of activity of the
multienzyme complexes in PG metabolism. Genetic modifications of the components of the PG biosynthetic
nanomachine will be used to test the observations from our structural studies. Our approach, utilizing high
resolution x-ray crystallographic tools along with cryo-EM single particle analysis, will allow visualization of
the action of enzymes in PG assembly and degradation and should provide mechanistic insights into their
orchestrated activity during the insertion of new PG during cell wall assembly and bacterial cell division. Our
studies will lead the way towards the development of new therapies targeting multiple peptidoglycan metabolic
enzymes."

enable detection of these pancreas-specific EVs from peripheral blood. This proposal combines the technical
expertise of Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC., with expertise in the biology of islet-derived extracellular vesicles of
our collaborator, Dr. Edward Phelps at the University of Florida."
10892466,"Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is a type of head and neck cancer and ~70% cases of OPC are associated with
high-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection. OPC cancers are increasing in prevalence especially in
persons living with HIV (PWH) and this group also has higher rates on HPV associated OPC. Reasons for these
findings are not well understood. While antiretroviral treatment (ART) does diminish HIV replication and immune
activation, in a large majority of PWH it is generally started in chronic infection, when HIV reservoirs have already
been established and uncontrolled HIV replication has resulted in significant immune dysfunction. Based on our
preliminary data and what is known in the literature, we hypothesize that ongoing HIV replication and the resultant
production of its proteins upregulates oncogenic HPV proteins (E6 and E7) thereby enhancing the probability of
OPC development. HIV replication also results in exhaustion of CD8 T cells which is further exacerbated by
increased HPV replication making HPV-specific CD8 T cells especially prone to overstimulation and exhaustion.
These dysfunctional CD8 T cells thus make it even more likely for OPC to occur in PWH. Furthermore, both HIV
protein production and immune activation continue after potent ART is started. As such, production of HIV
proteins from previously latently infected CD4 T cells continues to drive HPV oncogenic protein production as
well as CD8 T cell exhaustion and OPC continues to occur at higher rates in these PWH. Solidifying this overall
hypothesis as proposed in our 3 aims would provide comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of OPC in
PWH leading to improved prevention and therapies. Our overall study hypothesis is that chronic inflammation
despite ART in PWH favors both persistence and proliferation of hrHPV16 infected oropharyngeal
epithelial cells and contributes to impaired anti-HPV specific T cell immunity leading to initiation of OPC.
We will test this hypothesis in the following three aims: In aim 1, we will determine the HPV types present in
OPC from PWH and how T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity is impaired. We will examine whether multiple
HPV subtypes persist. In addition, we will determine whether tumor and CD8 are spatially distant and whether
the intra-tumoral CD8 are exhausted. Our aim 2 will determine how an HIV infection influences HPV
infection, its gene expression and DNA replication to facilitate oncogenic transformation of
oropharyngeal epithelial cells. Using 3D based models, we will show that HIV infection via its specific proteins
(Tat and/or envelope gp120) modulates HPV pathogenesis by interfering at one or more steps in its life cycle.
In aim 3, we will determine the mechanisms of HPV specific CD8 T cell dysfunction in PWH with OPC and
whether tumor specific immunity can be restored. Our successfully completed studies will show how chronic,
albeit low grade inflammation in PWH on ART is beneficial to the initiation of HPV associated OPC via increased
susceptibility of epithelial cells to HPV infection, increased oncogene expression which when coupled with an
inability of CD8 T cells to kill HPV infected cells tips the balance of an HPV infected cells towards OPC initiation."

The burden of infectious diseases and infection-related malignancies is high among US Hispanics and in Puerto
Rico (PR). Thus, research performed in PR provides a unique opportunity to advance cancer research, across
the cancer control continuum, with a special focus on the roles of microbes and infections in this field. The
University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center has provided mentored cancer prevention and control
research experiences in PR for master-level and health professional students since 2019. However, disease-
oriented research opportunities for college graduates, specifically postbaccalaureate (post bacs) individuals in
PR are scarce. Aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), to
conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and prevent infectious diseases,
our goal is to recruit, and train underrepresented recent college graduates who are interested in pursuing higher
education and research careers in the field. The Research Education Program on Microbes, Infections and
Cancer (REPMIC) will recruit 10 post bacs annually (for a total of 50 participants) to participate in a 9-month
program (37 weeks) designed to provide them with hands-on research experiences in the fields of microbes,
infections and cancer, and educational activities to help them apply and succeed in a graduate (PhD/DrPH)
and/or a health professions program. Participants will be selected based on their merit (academic performance,
letters of recommendation, and research interests) and will be matched to a mentor based on their research
interests in basic, clinical, and population-based research. Educational activities will include seminars and
workshops to strengthen their academic and research skills and increase their interest in pursuing a research
career in the fields of infectious diseases and cancer. REPMIC aims to: 1) Recruit 10 post bacs annually to
participate in a 9-month mentored hands-on research education program focused on understanding the
relationships between microbes, infections, and cancer; 2) Provide post bacs with the skills to apply and pursue
a graduate or health professions degree and a research career focused on the relationships between microbes,
infections, and cancer; and 3) Conduct process and outcome evaluation of program goals. Outcomes of interest
to be monitored include: (1) recruitment of participants from underrepresented groups, (2) satisfaction with the
research experience and (3) with seminars/workshops, (4) presentations in scientific meetings, (5) scientific
publications, and (6) pursuit of a graduate or professional degree and a career on infectious diseases and
cancer research. Among relevant topic areas, REPMIC will increase participants’ understanding of the roles
of microbes and infections in cancer development and treatment response, as well as in cancer prevention and
control research for infection-driven malignancies. REPMIC will also strengthen their research skills and
experience, and their competitiveness to continue higher education and a research career with a focus on areas
of interest for the NIAID, including HPV, HIV, human microbiome, and health disparities, among others."

Research demonstrates the health-related benefits of participation in daily physical activity (PA), including
prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Despite this knowledge, the majority of US adults, particularly
black women, do not achieve recommended levels of PA and, consequently, have higher rates of related
chronic disease. An efficacy study led by the proposed Principal Investigator developed and tested an in
person, 10-month group-based faith-integrated (FI) or secular (SEC) PA intervention, compared with a self-
guided control (SG) for black women. Both FI and SEC were superior to SG for increasing daily steps after 10
months, and FI was superior to SG for increasing daily steps 12 months post intervention. Barriers to program
participation noted by participants included childcare and work responsibilities and proximity to the group
meeting location. The 2018 PA Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report highlighted the need for
effective strategies to promote PA, including internet-delivered interventions which have demonstrated strong
evidence for effectiveness at increasing PA levels. Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of internet-
delivered interventions in racial/ethnic minority groups. Online delivery of our evidence-based program may
increase reach and address known barriers to PA program participation in black women. We therefore propose
to explore strategies for adapting the program for web-based delivery of the existing curriculum. R21 phase
aims are: Aim 1: Solicit input from individuals representative of the population of focus to inform the translation
of the FI curriculum for online use; Aim 2: Use the knowledge gathered in Aim 1 to adapt existing FI and SG
curricula for online use; Aim 3: Assess acceptability of the online curricula in an advisory group similar to the
target population. We will conduct focus groups with black women to understand factors that would influence
online delivery of the curriculum. We will identify a group of a 12 member advisory group to assist with
developing materials/strategies to adapt the curriculum for online delivery. In an iterative approach where
material is tested, refined, and retested until complete, we will engage the advisory group in feasibility testing
of the online curriculum. Data collected from the R21 phase will be used to inform the R33 phase that will: Aim
4: Conduct a randomized pilot intervention to field test the modified online curricula in a sample (n=60)
representative of participants who would meet eligibility criteria for enrollment in a full scale trial. We will
assess change in PA, acceptability of the modified interventions including intervention delivery methods, online
materials, recruitment, enrollment, and data collection methods, online engagement, and clinical markers of
disease. The proposed project is directly responsive to PAR-18-307. The intervention is informed by the socio-
ecological model and addresses PA at the intrapersonal (individual) and interpersonal (social support through
online group-based interaction) levels. The project will further enhance our current knowledge of successful
strategies to increase PA and reduce inactivity in high risk populations."
10893250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lack of physical activity is central to numerous health problems. Despite this, we have limited understanding of
the molecular components which confer the benefit of physical activity and their diverse impacts across tissues
with respect to age, sex, genetics, environment and other objective physiologic, morphometric, and metabolic
measures. Identifying these molecular signatures offers new opportunities for treatment and therapeutics. The
goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assemble a
comprehensive map of the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity and, when possible,
relate these changes to the benefits of physical activity. This map will be greatly facilitated by the application of
–omics technologies to identify exercise-responsive genes and to relate their benefits across multiple tissues
and contexts. Our Stanford Chemical Analysis Site (CAS) is a core component of the MoTrPAC project.
Together with Mount Sinai School of Medicine, we form the Genome, Epigenomics and Transcriptomics (GET)
team. At Stanford CAS, we have provided molecular data on 7820 samples as part of both human and rat
components of MoTrPAC studies. We have further led the development of key quality control and data analysis
pipelines to ensure rigor and reproducibility. Our site has also led key consortium manuscripts and
engagement efforts from the animal training study. In the final phase of MoTrPAC, we principally aim to provide
a genome for every MoTrPAC participant and a transcriptome for every participant sample and facilitate
making this data broadly accessible and useful to the research community. Our site will be responsible for the
generation of 15784 transcriptomes using RNA-seq. In addition to this effort, we have proposed to generate
chromatin accessibility profiles using ATAC-seq on 1190 muscle and PBMC samples and long read
transcriptomes using Iso-Seq on 110 muscle samples. The expected benefits of ATAC-seq and Iso-seq efforts
will be to enable (1) mapping regulatory changes using chromatin accessibility data, (2) expand profiling of
genetic effects using allele-specific measurements and (3) provide complete isoform data for a reference
collection of MoTrPAC samples through exercise intervention. Our site provides critical prior expertise and
infrastructure to accomplish these production goals and analyses. We have demonstrated expertise for
analysis of collected tissues, compliance with MoTrPAC protocols, collaboration with other Chemical Analysis
Sites and all other aspects of the consortium, timely data deposition and support of the Bioinformatics Center
and expertise in data sharing, enhancement of rigor and reproducibility in Common Fund projects and leading
coordinated publication activities. Our PI team also provides MoTrPAC with important cross-consortia expertise
to extend its impacts and ensure timely completion. Overall, we are eager to complete the MoTrPAC program
as envisioned, overcome remaining obstacles and rapidly share data, tools and analyses to the larger research
community."

The main objective of this proposal is to improve administrative and financial oversight of NIAID grants and to
enhance compliance with regulations that govern awards from NIH and other Federal sponsors at the Instituto
de Efectividad Clínica y Sanitaria (IECS), and other research institutions in South America. This will strengthen
IECS grant management capacity and provide a supportive environment for investigators by relieving them of
administrative burdens and giving them the freedom to increase productivity in their research endeavors.
Aim 1: to strengthen IECS capacity to manage NIAID/NIH grants in accordance with their high standards and
regulations: new or revised grants management processes will be generated resulting from the best practices
learned by two IECS senior grants administrators who will attend two training sessions at the US host
institution -Tulane University of Louisiana-, a NIH regional workshop on program funding and grants
administration, or a NIAID post-award grants policy and management training event, and five days of in-house
training with the Grants Management Program (GMP) at NIAID. IECS grant administrators trained under this
award will increase their own capacity for administrative and financial oversight of NIH grants, they will train
other IECS support personnel, and they will implement changes or improvements to grants management
activities at IECS.
Aim 2: to share knowledge on NIAID/NIH grant management at the institutional, national, and regional levels:
IECS will create a repository of grant management tools that can be easily accessed by investigators and
support personnel. To make these tools available to a larger community of colleagues, we will also lay the
groundwork for building a Grant Administrators Community of Practice (GACoP) in South America."

 Electrical microstimulation has become a mainstay of fundamental neuroscience exploration and an
increasingly prevalent clinical therapy. Despite the growing prevalence of neuromodulation therapies, the
fundamental physiological and mechanistic properties driving the beneficial effect for the patient are poorly
understood. This R01 application aims to greatly improve our understanding of how different non-neuronal
cells (myeloid lineage, oligodendrocyte progenitor lineage, and vascular smooth muscle cells) respond and
contribute to the electrical stimulation response. Understanding of the relationship between stimulation
parameters and supporting non-neuronal cell activity, including blood flow, will help determine the impact of
electrical microstimulation on chronic circuit behavior in-vivo over time. In this proposal, we use leading-edge in
vivo multiphoton imaging techniques with multiple transgenic animals to systematically evaluate the
relationship between stimulation parameters and the induced changes over time at the molecular, cellular, and
local network. An improved understanding of the impact of electrical microstimulation on the overall tissue
health, changes to the foreign body response, stimulation of tissue repair, and safety limits will help inform
improved stimulation paradigms and device design for therapeutic applications and basic neuroscience
research."
10894654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 15% of the U.S. population has chronic kidney disease, and ~700,000 patients are in full kidney
failure also called end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The optimal treatment for ESKD is living donor kidney
transplantation (LDKT), followed by deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT); however, the standard of
care continues to be ongoing dialysis, which has poor clinical outcomes in comparison to LDKT and DDKT. Best
practices to transform kidney care recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),
the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) and the 2019 Executive Order Advancing American Kidney Health
Initiative include earlier detection of patients whose kidneys are deteriorating rapidly, introducing transplant as a
potential treatment option earlier, optimally before their kidneys fail, improved dissemination of health literate
transplant education tools, often through digital technology or mHealth, and increasing LDKT rates by helping
patients locate living donors or motivating others to donate. Barriers at the patient-, support network-, clinician-
and system-levels of the Socio-Ecological Model persist, including poor identification of high-risk patients,
insufficient clinician time to discuss transplant, poor transplant knowledge, reluctance or insufficient support to
ask living donors to donate, and disengaged friends and relatives, some of whom who might become living
donors. While extensive policy and intervention efforts are underway, none have achieved significant increases
in pursuit and receipt of transplant, especially LDKT rates. In 2017, Kaiser Permanente Southern California
(KPSC), an integrated care system serving 24,000 CKD patients, partnered with the Transplant Research and
Education Center (TREC) at Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) and J.C. Walter Jr. Transplant Center
Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH) to launch a multi-year plan for transforming CKD and ESKD care. We now
propose to conduct a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of a novel multilevel intervention to
improve CKD and ESKD care, improve transplant rates and reduce disparities. One innovative component of
the multilevel intervention is a state-of-the-art technology-supported Grove Kidney Health mHealth application,
developed in partnership with patients, to engage patients, family members, and potential living donors to
improve their CKD knowledge, view transplant success stories, and seek kidney-related support to pursue
transplant, including learning how to find living donors. We also seek to identify moderators at various socio-
ecological levels, especially factors influencing variations in effectiveness across different settings and among
underserved patient subgroups known to have reduced access to transplant and build implementation tools to
increase access to and pursuit of transplant within large integrated health systems including comparable systems
(commercial, academic, safety net) across the U.S."
10894600,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Even though cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the most commonly used volumetric image
guidance modality, its role has been severely limited in the context of treatment monitoring and patient-specific
treatment modifications in radiation therapy. Due to CBCT’s poor image quality, clinicians cannot clearly
visualize soft tissues to assess anatomical changes, thus affecting their clinical decision-making. Moreover,
tools for treatment monitoring, such as deformable registration and dose calculation, do not function robustly
with today’s CBCT images due to the lack of CT number accuracy.
 Scattered radiation remains to be the fundamental problem in improving CBCT image quality. Thus, in
this project, we propose the two-dimensional antiscatter grid (2D Grid) as a novel device to address the scatter
problem and achieve high-quality CBCT images that are suitable for treatment monitoring. Our device has
fundamentally different architecture and fabrication than existing antiscatter grids for CBCT. Due to its
optimized grid structure, our 2D Grid provides both higher primary transmission and better scatter rejection
performance than today’s state-of-the-art antiscatter grids. Due to its favorable primary transmission and
scatter rejection performance, our 2D Grid improves the contrast-to-noise ratio and CT number accuracy to
levels not achievable with existing antiscatter grids.
 We hypothesize that our 2D Grid will provide significantly better soft tissue visualization and CT number
accuracy, and deformable registration algorithms are expected to perform significantly better. To test our
hypotheses, we will develop and optimize data processing methods for 2D Grid implementation in CBCT (Aim
1). Subsequently, we will fabricate 2D Grid prototypes and evaluate their performance in clinical CBCT
systems for photon and proton therapy (Aim 2). Following phantom based evaluations, we will conduct a
prospective clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of improved image quality (Aim 3). We will perform
observer studies to quantify the improvement in soft tissue visualization with respect to existing clinical CBCT
and gold-standard Helical CT, assess the improvement in accuracy of deformable image registration
algorithms, and evaluate the improvement in consistency of image intensity and texture features.
 While our application is focused on radiation therapy, the 2D Grid can play a key role in other CBCT
applications, such as interventional radiology, extremity imaging, and intraoperative imaging. Due to its
improved low-contrast visualization performance, our 2D Grid may also allow reduction of the imaging dose in
CBCT."

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has
the poorest prognosis of all major subtypes of breast cancer. The anticipated success of immunotherapy has not
been seen in TNBC. The role of T-cells in TNBC and immunotherapy has been well-studied but the role of tumor-
infiltrating B-cells (TIL-B) is less well-known. Present in up to 60% of breast cancers, TIL-B are associated with
improved prognosis and response to chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that TIL-B respond directly to tumor
antigens in TNBC. Utilizing single-cell sequencing of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in TNBC, we have identified
high expression of a low diversity of paired heavy and light chain B-cell receptor segments which is definitive
evidence of clonal selection, suggesting B-cells have undergone affinity maturation and can recognize antigens.
In order to clone antibodies and identify their targets in TNBC, we have successfully sequenced the B-cell
receptors of the most abundant B-cell clones we have identified thus far. Pre-clinical data also suggests an
important role for B-cell antibody production in immunotherapy efficacy. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that B-cells in TNBC recognize tumor-associated antigens and produce biologically relevant tumor-specific
antibodies. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Discover the role of clonally selected B-
cells/plasmablasts in human TNBC, 2) Characterize the endogenous antibody response against TNBC, and 3)
Evaluate the impact of immune checkpoint inhibition on B-cell receptor diversity and phenotype in human TNBC.
Successful execution of these aims will support a role for B-cells in the anti-tumor immune response and lay the
foundation for development of novel B-cell based therapies and/or biomarkers in TNBC. In addition to advancing
scientific knowledge, this proposal provides training to a physician-scientist. Dr. Downs-Canner is a practicing
breast-surgical oncologist with a background in cellular immunology. Her long-term goal is to combine her clinical
and research expertise to develop an independently-funded research program focused on immunotherapy in
breast cancer. She benefits from two well-established mentors with track records of training clinician-scientists
and an extremely supportive research and practice environment. In order to achieve her long-term goals, the
candidate's proposal includes a structured career development plan and training in: 1) bioinformatics 2) antibody
cloning techniques and development of expertise in: 1) B-cell biology and 2) increasingly complex hypothesis
driven experimental design, execution, and analysis. The proposed plan includes mentored experiential learning,
course work and conference participation, frequent mentor meetings and a gradual increase in research
independence. At the completion of the award period, the candidate will be prepared to apply for independent
funding for her research program."
10894616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal identity is generated during development, with identity characterized by neuron-specific
gene expression, axon/dendrite morphology, and connectivity. Homeodomain transcription factors
(TFs) are required for establishing gene expression and neuronal morphology, but whether they are
required for neuronal connectivity is unknown. Understanding the developmental processes
generating neuronal identity in general, and connectivity in particular, is essential for understanding
brain assembly and function. An attractive model is that homeodomain TFs – known to regulate
neuronal molecular and morphological identity – also facilitate the expression of cell surface
molecules that allow the formation of highly-specific neural connections. Connections between
individual neurons contribute to neural circuits, which allow sensation, movement and cognition.
Proper circuit function throughout life relies on continued circuit remodeling, both synaptically and
structurally. Interestingly, homeodomain TFs are expressed in adult neurons, well after neuronal
identity has been established. I hypothesize that the homeodomain TFs are required for neural
circuit establishment and maintenance throughout life. To test this, I have performed a
systematic screen for homeodomain TFs required for the function of a locomotor neural circuit in
Drosophila, the Moonwalker Descending Neuron (MDN) and Pair1 circuit. I have identified 16
homeodomain TFs required for MDN or Pair1 optogenetic induced locomotion. In Aim 1, I will test
how these 16 homeodomain TFs contribute to neuronal identity by assaying molecular identity,
axon/dendrite morphology, and connectivity. My pilot experiments have already shown that the
homeodomain TF Bicoid is required for connectivity but not molecular identity or morphology. In Aim
2, I will utilize how the MDN-Pair1 circuit is remodeled during Drosophila metamorphosis and persists
in the adult fly. I will assay whether the TFs required for establishing MDN-Pair1 connectivity are also
required for maintaining the MDN-Pair1 circuit throughout adulthood. My pilot data shows that Bicoid
is also expressed in the adult Pair1 neurons. My overarching goal is to advance the understanding of
how developmental mechanisms, specifically homeodomain TFs, establish circuits during
development and maintain circuits after periods of plasticity/remodeling. Given that fly and
mammalian neurogenesis share many conserved features, that homeodomain TFs are highly
conserved between species, and that aberrant neural circuits have been implicated in
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, we expect our results to be both translatable and
therapeutically relevant."

decreasing supply of physician researchers. The Group concluded that MD-PhD programs, including the
Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), have been successful in promoting the development of physician-
scientists and should be continued. The VCU MD-PhD program has been addressing this shortfall since 1986.
Our mission is to train diverse physician-scientists to improve human health through discovery in basic and
social sciences and biomedical engineering. Our program objectives are Excellence in Clinical Training,
Excellence in Research Training, Program Quality and Satisfaction, and Career Success.
 In the past four years, our recruitment efforts, growing pool of qualified applicants, and holistic admissions
process have greatly enhanced our ability to enroll a diverse cadre of highly qualified trainees. Our uniquely
integrated curriculum is tailored to meet the needs of physician-scientist trainees, with clinical and research
learning integrated over the entire training period. We promote rigorous, transparent, reproducible research
methods, founded in ethical principles of responsible conduct throughout training. Our training program is
centered on the trainee, with transparent leadership and trainee input. Our participating faculty members
represent a broad spectrum of biomedical science disciplines and are supported by ample research funding.
Our program is committed to mentorship training and an environment that is safe, equitable, and inclusive.
 Our governance structure has a prominent role for students and a faculty steering committee to assist our
experienced leadership team to continuously improve the program. We closely monitor the progress of
individual trainees, support their efforts and wellness, and address their concerns. A detailed, trainee-centered
evaluation plan guides us to achieve our objectives with specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound,
inclusive, and equitable goals.
 Our recent trainees have been highly productive, securing individual training grants, publishing original
research, and graduating to top research-intensive residency programs. We are on an upward trajectory in
virtually every metric that can be used to assess program quality. As our trainees succeed, our ability to attract
highly qualified diverse applicants continues to grow, perpetuating a virtuous cycle.
 The VCU MD-PhD program is the largest physician scientist program in the country that provides full
support for all its trainees but is not funded by an MSTP. Support from the VCU School of Medicine has been
extremely generous. In addition, our program has benefited from philanthropic outreach that resulted in a $4M
endowment and a $100K enrichment fund. With MSTP funding, we seek to leverage this exemplary support
and our superior program plan to increase the number of trainees to whom our mission applies, expanding our
ability to reduce the physician-scientist shortage."
10894620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysbiosis between the oral microbiome and host underpins the development of dental caries. Assembly of the
oral microbiome occurs hours after birth and evolves over time in response to environmental exposures. Early
life is therefore a critical window when the microbiome is particularly susceptible to environmental exposures,
including nutritional and toxic chemicals. Large scale studies of the impact of early life environment exposures
on microbiome trajectories and subsequent risk of pediatric caries, have been prevented due to a lack of
technology to directly measure the fetal environmental exposures and lack of statistical measures to account
for the high dimensional data generated by –omic assays. We propose to overcome these limitations by
combining metagenomic oral microbiome data with direct measures of fetal and postnatal exposure to essential
elements and toxic metals as well as metabolomics data measured from the prenatal and early childhood
periods using specialized tooth-matrix biomarkers that we have developed. The long term goal is to better
understand the interaction of environment and the oral microbiome, and their separate and combined effects on
caries development. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify environmental exposures and critical
windows during development that impact the microbiome trajectory and modify caries risk. We leverage an
existing population-based prospective cohort of 500 twins in which biosamples, clinical data and supporting
data have already been collected from a substantial portion of participants. Our overarching hypothesis is that
environmental exposures during early life alter the acquisition and maturation of the oral microbiome, and in the
background of genetic risk, mediate oral health outcomes in childhood. Guided by strong preliminary data, this
hypothesis will be tested by 1) determining the association between prenatal and early postnatal exposures
with the assembly and evolution of the oral microbiome and 2) determining how early life exposures and oral
microbiome trajectories contribute, separately and jointly, to caries risk. The approach is innovative in its
technique of measuring biomarkers of environmental exposures in temporally assigned zones of deciduous
teeth to reconstruct prenatal and early postnatal histories of exposure, measurement of the oral microbiome at
5 time points to construct trajectories, application of high dimensional statistical methods and leveraging of a
twin cohort to assess gene x environment x microbiome interactions. The proposed research is significant
because it will identify actionable environmental risk factors for pediatric dental caries and lay the foundation for
future studies that can leverage these resources to better understand the interaction between environmental
exposure mixtures and microbiome trajectories and impacts on oral health."
10894409,"Myostatin (MSTN, GDF-8) is a secreted signaling protein that we discovered many years ago as a
transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) family member that normally acts to limit skeletal muscle growth. A
major focus of my laboratory has been to elucidate the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms
underlying MSTN activity, with the goal of developing strategies to target this pathway for clinical applications.
Biochemical studies carried out by us and by others have identified many key regulatory and signaling
components, which has led to the model that MSTN, along with activin A, regulates muscle growth and
function by binding first to the type 2 receptors, ACVR2 and ACVR2B, and then engaging the type 1 receptors,
ALK4 and ALK5. The formation of this receptor complex leads to activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, which are
the key mediators of the canonical signaling pathway for these ligands. To determine their roles in vivo, we
have generated mice carrying flox alleles for each of these components and examined the effect of targeting
them either individually or in combination specifically in skeletal myofibers. These studies have led to
unexpected findings that have revealed major gaps in our understanding of how this system operates in vivo.
One unexpected finding was that simultaneously targeting SMAD2 and SMAD3 led to only modest increases in
muscle mass, implying that MSTN/activin A utilize both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways in
vivo. A second unexpected finding was that targeting the two type 1 receptors for MSTN/activin A has a
substantially greater effect on muscle mass than targeting the two type 2 receptors. Our new findings, taken
together with studies by other groups showing that muscle growth is regulated by other TGF-ß family
members, specifically BMPs, that act antagonistically to MSTN and activin A, have led us to propose a new
model that competition between MSTN/activin A and BMPs occurs primarily at the level of the type 2 receptors.
The overall goal of this project will be to use a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to
elucidate further how all of these regulatory components interrelate in muscle, specifically to determine
whether different components of this regulatory system have distinct roles in regulating muscle growth and
function, particularly with respect to metabolic function. The Specific Aims of this project will be to elucidate
SMAD-dependent versus SMAD-independent effects in skeletal myofibers; to assess the effect of blocking
SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways in skeletal muscle in mouse models of metabolic
dysfunction and muscle wasting; and to elucidate how MSTN/activin A signaling and BMP signaling interrelate
in myofibers. We believe that the studies outlined in this proposal will provide key insights into the
mechanisms by which this complex network of regulatory and signaling components function in an integrated
manner to regulate muscle homeostasis and will inform drug development efforts to maximize the anabolic
potential of targeting this pathway in muscle to treat patients with muscle and metabolic diseases."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are highly prevalent, devastating to patients and their loved ones, and encompass a diversity of etiologies and pathologies. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and repetitive head impacts (RHI) can contribute to the initiation and/or acceleration of ADRDs, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), but critical gaps in knowledge prevent the development of effective diagnostic strategies and therapeutic interventions. Most importantly, mechanisms through which diverse patterns of head trauma increase risk for AD/ADRD/CTE are not known, nor is it clear how multiple pathological processes interact to influence symptom manifestation and disease progression. These knowledge gaps must be addressed to enable in vivo diagnosis and disease-modifying therapeutics in our lifetime - the highest-priority recommendation for post-TBI AD/ADRD from the 2022 ADRD Summit. To address these critical issues, we propose NEW-HOPE-TBI, a unique and powerful cohort and open-access biospecimen, imaging, and data resource to enable and enhance research to better understand connections between macroscopic (neuroimaging) and microscopic (neuropathology) features of posttraumatic AD/ADRD/CTE. To accomplish this, we propose to expand our existing nationwide network of well-characterized brain donors from diverse cohorts with heterogeneous TBI exposures and/or AD/ADRD (Aim 1), broadly characterize co-pathology burden about head trauma (HT) exposure patterns (Aim 2), identify quantitative neuropathology and imaging signatures of cognitive and behavioral decline in chronic TBI and post-traumatic neurodegeneration (Aim 3), and deeply phenotype meso- to micro- scale vascular pathology in TBI (Aim 4). Through this work, we will build a unique open-access biospecimen and data biorepository that includes digital pathology and imaging data linked to accessible brain tissues and biofluids, and critical metadata including TBI exposure history, cognitive and behavioral health metrics, and social determinants of health, from well-characterized research donors (Aim 5). We have assembled a world-class team of scientists, clinicians, neuroimagers, neuropathologists, and biostatisticians to fulfill the goals of this proposal, including Dr. Tim Brown, a bioethics expert who is committed to advising NEW-HOPE-TBI concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion in our research team and cohort. Finally, to promote AD and ADRD neuropathology research far into the future, we place great emphasis on the career development and engagement of junior neuropathologists and fellows who represent the next generation of post-traumatic neurodegenerative neuropathology researchers. The proposed work is made possible by leveraging clinical TBI and AD/ADRD studies, network-based autopsy with ex vivo MRI, postmortem data that far exceed the NIH CDEs, a world-class team of senior, mid-level, and early-stage investigators, and a unique focus on neuroethics to enhance diversity in neuropathology research. No other team in the world can lead the science and data sharing proposed herein."

Initiated in 2014, the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Cell Polarity Signaling filled a very important but
unmet need, as there were no regular conferences on the broad topic of cell polarity prior to the initiation of this
GRC meeting. Based on highly positive feedback from the first four GRCs, we are organizing a fifth meeting for
2024 to continue an ongoing forum for the very dynamic and diverse cell polarity field. Polarity is fundamental
to all of biology, with profound implications for cell and tissue organization in normal development and
homeostasis, and in numerous diseases including cancer. For these reasons, cell polarity has become an
important area of research with increasing number of investigators. To bring new participants and topics to the
meeting, the 2024 GRC intends to diversify the topics even more under the subtitle of ‘Polarity and asymmetry
in tissue architecture and cell fate’, covering a new aspect of cell polarity that had not been covered previously.
A Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized by two postdoctoral trainees and subtitled “Mechanics of
polarity signal integration across scales” will precede the GRC. The GRS is expected to attract ~50 trainees to
present and discuss their research. The GRS will foster networking and collaborations to help trainees develop
their careers. It will also provide a valuable learning experience for those involved in organizing the GRS.
Several senior investigators in the cell polarity field will be invited to the GRS to discuss their research and
provide mentoring and feedback.
Sessions at the GRS and GRC will range from basic cell biology and development of model organisms to
translational studies in cancer biology. Many talks at the GRC will focus on the meeting subtitle – ‘Polarity and
asymmetry in tissue architecture and cell fate.’ The invited speakers for 2024 will be different from that of the
2022 conference, and the majority of them have never been invited as speakers to any previous Cell Polarity
GRC. Newly added topics and experimental systems will keep the meeting fresh and relevant and will broaden
the number of investigators who can present their research. Among the ~30 invited speakers/chairs from
multiple countries, 50% are women, ~30% are junior PIs. We paid special attention to diversifying demography
as well, although we not have exact data on the number of NIH-defined URM. 20 short talks will be selected
from submitted abstracts. Interactive poster presentations will take place on 4 afternoons, and several poster
presenters will be selected to present poster preview talks to advertise their poster. The program includes a
‘Power Hour’ to discuss the challenges women and URMs face in academia. We will promote diversity in the
programs for the GRC and GRS, through GRC minority fellowship funding, and through focused advertising via
scientific societies. We envision that the 2024 GRC/GRS will facilitate discussion of cutting edge research in
cell polarity and will foster collaborations that will fuel the field forward."

The digit tips of many mammals, including humans, innately regenerate following amputation. Multi-tissue digit
tip regeneration requires coordinated proliferation and interaction of many cell types in a structure termed the
‘blastema’. Significant progress has been made in defining the origin and cellular composition of the mouse
digit tip blastema, but there is a gap in our understanding of how the heterogeneous blastema becomes a
correctly organized and shaped composite tissue. This proposal focuses on defining the molecular
mechanism(s) of patterning the regenerating mouse digit tip. In general, broad similarities between the
regenerative blastema and the embryonic limb bud underlie the hypothesis that gene networks required for
embryonic limb patterning are re-deployed in the regenerative blastema. While studies support this hypothesis
in some non-mammalian models of limb regeneration, our data demonstrate that this is not true for dorsal-
ventral patterning during mouse digit tip regeneration. This suggests that mammalian and non-mammalian
limb-derived blastemas may employ different mechanisms for re-establishing limb tissue morphology. We
propose that the mammalian digit tip blastema utilizes non-developmental patterning mechanisms and
receives molecular patterning cues from the nail epithelium. In this proposal, we focus on the dorsal-ventral
and proximal-distal anatomical axes; we aim to determine the patterning mechanism(s) in the mouse digit tip
blastema and to determine how manipulation of these pathways during regeneration impacts morphology.
Toward this, we will model and molecularly define proximal-distal patterning genes using computational and
genetic approaches. We will also use grafting studies to determine the tissue patterning autonomy of the digit
tip blastema. Finally, we will visualize putative dorsal-ventral electrochemical gradients in the blastema and
perform gain and loss of function studies to manipulate these signals. Collectively, the data generated from this
project will reveal patterning mechanisms for mammalian digit tip regeneration and highlight how this may be
fundamentally different from non-mammalian limb regeneration models. This research will ultimately inform
blastema induction efforts for mammalian full limb amputations because exogenous patterning information may
need to be provided."

My career goal is to be an independent investigator in clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
focusing on the relationship between depressive symptoms and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that BBB function is significantly abnormal in treatment-resistant depression (TRD)
and is associated with depressive symptoms, with region specificity that underwrites core depressive symptom
domains, and are clinically improvable using TMS. The specific aims are to: 1) test if BBB abnormalities occur
in specific symptom domains of TRD; and 2) test if TMS-induced BBB functional improvements explain symptom
responses in TRD patients. To investigate these aims, the hypotheses are: 1) the TRD group will have specific
BBB dysfunctions compared to a group of age-, sex-, and metabolically-matched controls, and will be correlated
to core depressive symptom domains; and 2) BBB function, in subsets of patients, will predict core depressive
symptom domain outcomes to accelerated TMS (aTMS) treatment a priori. Underlying regional BBB patterns will
be tested with using measurements obtained before and after a course of aTMS. We propose that aTMS
improves BBB function in the target region (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or connected frontostriatal/limbic areas)
and that the same regions will not reveal BBB changes similarly in non-responders. More broadly, my goal is to
uncover BBB functions implicating a biological mechanism linked to TRD and improved by aTMS to build new,
testable, mechanistic insights for future clinical trial work. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award (K23) builds upon a firm background in BBB cellular and molecular biology and clinical
expertise in psychiatry to bridge these areas in highly translational ways. Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-
Presbyterian Hospital is a premier institution, with top-ranked clinical and research programs on which to support
and build my career. The primary mentor, Dr. Conor Liston, is a psychiatrist who has made major scientific
contributions to psychiatric neuroimaging and TMS research, detailing mechanisms and that have propelled the
field forward. The co-mentor, Dr. Danny J. J. Wang, is an expert in MRI physics/engineering widely prized in the
field, with key advancements to methods of BBB measurements used in this study. Critical progress to our
understanding of BBB functioning in TRD, symptom domains, and its ability to be improved by aTMS will be
known by study conclusion, along with a potentially detectable subtype of TRD most amenable to these findings
and interventions."

RNA functions as the central conduit of information exchange in all cells. RNA molecules encode this
information in both their primary sequences and in complex structures that form when RNA folds back
on itself. A consistent theme from our MIRA-supported work to date is that biological function mediated
by RNA structure is ubiquitous in both eubacterial and eukaryotic organisms. The broad and
fundamental importance of RNA structure is clear, but there remains a profound knowledge gap: We
generally have only rudimentary understanding of RNA structure across vast regions of most
messenger and non-coding RNAs. We need to move beyond modeling RNA structure to directly
detecting through-space structural communication and interactions in cells. Our lab takes a near-unique
approach, simultaneously focusing on experimental simplicity and directness and on extensive
validation in model systems. In essentially every instance where we have applied rigorous and
quantitative technologies to study RNA structure-function interrelationships, new insights regarding
biological regulatory mechanisms have emerged. We have also shown that RNA elements with higher-
order structures are more likely to contain high-information-content clefts and pockets that bind small
molecules, broadly informing a vigorous field of RNA-targeted drug discovery. This work is designed to
have sustained long-term impact by pursuing three overarching opportunities. First, the project focuses
on development of decisive, concise, and broadly implementable technologies for discovering and
assessing higher-order structure in RNA. Second, this project applies these direct and experimentally
concise methods to challenges of broad importance, from identification of structures essential for
replication of pathogenic viruses to understanding how RNA conformational ensembles govern
transcriptional gene regulation and pre-mRNA splicing. Third, understanding the propensity of RNA to
form higher-order structures – and often clefts and pockets – opens up the possibility of targeting these
motifs with small molecules, an opportunity we will exploit with the long-term goal of inventing facile and
straightforward strategies for creating RNA-targeted therapeutics."

10877044,"ABSTRACT
Adults with obesity have increased myeloid inflammatory responses that associate with cardiovascular and
metabolic disease. There are several gaps, though, in our current understanding of metabolic inflammation
(meta-inflammation) including our understanding of initiating changes in myelopoiesis and regulated changes
in myeloid cells. It is clear that some individuals develop a meta-inflammatory response placing them at higher
risk for metabolic impairment while others are protected. While it is clinically important to identify adolescents
at risk for future disease, we do not understand how to use meta-inflammatory markers to assess disease risk.
Our previous human and mouse studies demonstrate that individuals who expand inflammatory monocytes in
response to obesogenic diets are at greatest risk for metabolic disease. Based on the ability of these
monocytes to generate an inflammatory response, traffic to tissues and differentiate into inflammatory tissue
macrophages promoting insulin resistance, we are terming them meta-inflammatory monocytes (MiMo). Given
that animal models and clinical studies have demonstrated that myeloid inflammation with circulating cytokines,
enhanced circulating myeloid cells and tissue inflammation are linked with insulin resistance it is critical to
understand if these same mechanisms exist in adolescents and can differentiate who is at risk for future
metabolic disease. This proposal is based on the scientific premise that a diet high in saturated fatty acids
(SFA) leads to myeloid leukocyte activation with expansion of myeloid progenitors, Ly6chi blood monocytes,
and pro-inflammatory tissue macrophages leading to tissue dysfunction in animal studies. We propose the
central hypothesis that adolescents at risk for metabolic disease have an increase in MiMos and enhanced
MiMo recruitment, cytokine secretion and macrophage polarization leading to insulin resistance. We will
evaluate this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) To define the monocyte transcriptomic signatures associated
with metabolic disease in adolescents. Aim 2) To determine high risk and low risk monocyte phenotypes
produced in adolescents with metabolic impairment. Aim 3) To assess meta-inflammatory monocyte activation
and metabolism in response to dietary fatty acid stimulation. This proposal is innovative in the modeling and
translational approach which is of high clinical significance. While the role of inflammation and metabolic
disease has been studied over the last few decades little is known about this association in adolescents. This
project will close the critical gap in translating pre-clinical studies on meta-inflammatory monocytes (MiMos) to
adolescents. It will also investigate the mechanisms of disease risk through identification of detrimental
monocyte phenotypes and the role of dietary fats in driving MiMo activation. These findings will lead to both
biomarkers for prediction and pathways for intervention in pediatric metabolic disease."

Hearing loss affects 1 in 500 newborns and ~1 in 3 individuals over the age of 65. This disorder is often
caused by the loss of mechanosensory hair cells (HCs), a deficiency that is permanent in the mature
mammalian cochlea. Therefore, artificial approaches have been developed to regenerate HCs by `converting'
non-HCs into HCs; and in mice they have proven successful in generating HC-like cells. However, these cells
fail to mature fully and their lifespan is short, indicating that not all major barriers to HC regeneration have been
overcome. The HC-regenerating approaches have been based on studies of physiological HC development.
These have shown that the transcription factor `Atonal homolog 1' (ATOH1) is fundamental for HC
development but that its effects on gene expression are context dependent. These effects differ in HCs versus
other ATOH1-expressing cells. Thus, ATOH1 function is fine-tuned by other transcription factors. Harnessing
the full potential of ATOH1 for the regeneration of HCs will require the identification of novel modifiers of
ATOH1 activity in HCs. Our preliminary data suggest that ATOH1 activity and HC maturation are regulated by
the transcription factor `thymocyte selection‐associated HMG box protein' (TOX). Knockout of the Tox gene in
mice (Tox∆/∆) caused HC loss and deafness, and RNA-seq analysis of the organ of Corti in these mice
revealed that a variety of genes are expressed at abnormal levels. The `abnormally low expression' group
includes ATOH1 target genes, `RE1-silencing transcription factor' (REST) target genes, and the transcriptional
repressor-encoding gene castor zinc finger 1 (Casz1). Targeted mutagenesis of Casz1 in organ of Corti
cultures revealed that CASZ1 is needed for the repression of several genes that are expressed at abnormally
high levels in the Tox∆/∆ organ of Corti. Our preliminary characterization of conditional Casz1 knock-out mice
revealed that HC-specific deletion of Casz1 causes outer HC (OHC) degeneration and hearing loss. In addition,
our previous analyses of REST function showed that perinatal downregulation of REST activity is needed for
HC maturation. The objective of the proposed research is to define the role of TOX in the maturation of
HCs. Our central hypothesis is that TOX supports cochlear HC maturation by modulating ATOH1, REST, and
CASZ1 activities in developing HCs. We propose to test this hypothesis through 2 specific aims: Aim 1)
determine the effects of TOX on HC maturation during various phases of cochlear development, and the extent
to which it supports ATOH1 activity, REST regulation, and artificially induced production of HC-like cells; Aim
2) determine the effects of CASZ1 on HC morphology and cochlear gene expression, and identify gene
repressor complexes that mediate the CASZ1-dependent repression of some of the indirect target genes of
TOX in HCs. These aims will be achieved using a variety of methods ranging from RNA-seq to somatic cell
genome-editing. The proposed studies are significant because identification of novel modifiers of ATOH1
activity will be necessary for improving the rational design of HC-regenerating approaches."

Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant risk to human health. Among emerging pathogens,
hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) pose the greatest risk in terms of the potential for morbidity and
mortality. These viruses are endemic in remote regions, produce large outbreaks that display high
mortality rates, and have a high potential become pandemics. One of the largest families of HFVs is the
Arenaviruses, which includes 6 DHHS select agents. The most well-known of these, Lassa virus, has
caused an increasing number of infections in recent years, including a 2018 outbreak in Nigeria that led
to over 100 deaths. In 2017, the World health Organization designated Lassa virus as a priority
pathogen for R&D efforts due to its potential to generate a public health emergency. Other hemorrhagic
fever arenaviruses, including Lujo, Chapare, Guanarito, Junin, and Machupo represent an increasing
source of concern based on their increased distribution and recent instances of human-to-human
transmission. Current diagnostic capabilities for Lassa virus and other arenaviruses are extremely
limited, especially in the case of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic assays. Here, we propose to develop a
POC diagnostic assay with the sensitivity and breadth of coverage required to diagnose Lassa virus
infections currently present in West Africa. In addition, we will generate single chain antibody phage
display libraries, broadly reactive high affinity diagnostic antibody pairs, a prototype assay chips for the 5
other arenaviruses that are Category A Priority Pathogens. We have previously used these procedures
to develop a POC diagnostic assay for Ebola virus that displays a sensitivity better than the current gold
standard, PCR. The successful completion of these studies will result in the first POC diagnostic assay
that is capable of detecting all Lassa strains of clinical importance and a panel of high affinity diagnostic
Abs and assays for all Category A Arenaviruses. In addition, the broadly reactive single chain antibody
libraries we produce could be used to rapidly generate diagnostic antibodies against novel arenaviruses
that arise as zoonotic outbreaks. This work will thus significantly improve our preparedness for almost
any future major Arenavirus outbreak with pandemic potential."
10877164,"Structural variations (SVs) analysis is very important because they are a major source of genetic variations and
account for a wide range of phenotypes in many species. To better understand their contribution to diversity,
divergence, and a variety of phenotypic traits, we should address two critical issues for SV analysis:
accurate SV characterization and understanding their formation mechanisms. Without accurate SV
results, we may miss the SV events that account for the phenotypes. Without understanding their formation
mechanisms, we may not distinguish the phenotype associated SVs from other SVs. As the sequencing
technology evolves, many new sequencing platforms such as PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, and 10X Genomics
with longer sequencing reads appeared and have demonstrated great potential. However, the computational
algorithms for SV analysis are inadequate for organisms both with and without a reference genome and SV
mechanism analysis was merely based on short (<10bp mostly) breakpoint junction sequences due to
technical limitations. As more of such data is being generated, there is an urgent need to fill in the gap by
developing more accurate and efficient algorithms for SV discovery and establishing an innovative way to
investigate SV formation mechanisms. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to comprehensively characterize
all forms of SVs and understand their functional consequences and formation mechanisms. The goals of the
next three years are to develop efficient algorithms to SV analysis for organisms both with and without a
reference. We will focus on large insertions, inversions, and complex SVs which are always underrepresented.
For organisms with a reference, we will develop a de novo assembly evaluation method to optimize existing
tools and/or develop new assembly methods. Given these toolkits, the goals for the following two years are to
study the SV formation mechanisms based on global genomic architecture. Our central hypothesis is that there
may be some hotspots, signatures around the SV locus either inherited from paternal or maternal genomes
causing the rearrangement formation susceptibility. We will test the hypothesis based on investigating a global
and haplotype picture of SVs using the new sequencing platforms. It is expected that the research will
contribute a suite of robust methods on the long-read sequencing data to identify all forms of SVs with high
sensitivity and precision. Besides, it is expected that this work will provide novel insights into SV formation
mechanisms. The proposed work is innovative in that the proposed computational approach will greatly
improve the sensitivity and precision for SV detection using long sequencing reads under the circumstances of
both with and without a reference genome. Also, the outcomes of this work may vertically advance the SV
mechanism research. The proposed research is significant because it will facilitate the discovery of pathogenic
variations and the establishment of the association between genotype and phenotype. It may also popularize
the usage of new sequencing platforms to address novel scientific questions."
10877167,"Coronary heart disease affects over 18.2 million Americans and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is the
most common cardiac surgery in adults. Unfortunately, CABG is associated with stroke, cognitive impairment,
and dementia, especially among women and patients with diabetes. As many as 25% of patients with a clinically
uncomplicated postoperative course have evidence of brain emboli after CABG, and even small infarcts can
unmask latent neurodegeneration and increase postoperative cognitive impairment. Intraoperative
thromboembolism is one of the mechanisms contributing to cognitive impairment, due to surgical aortic
manipulation. Less aortic manipulation is associated with less plaque dislodgement, resulting in fewer embolic
events during cardiac surgery. The Randomized comparison of the clinical Outcome of single versus
Multiple Arterial grafts: Cognition (ROMA:Cog) study will identify both the global impact of CABG surgery
and the impact of acute infarction on cognitive function. The first aim addresses the impact of CABG surgical
technique on long-term cognitive function in an international cohort of 2,000 participants who have been
randomized to either a multiple arterial grafts or single arterial grafts groups and by important subgroups,
including women and patients with diabetes. Results will either demonstrate differences in cognitive function or
provide reassurance to cardiac surgeons that there are no differences in the proportion of patients with cognitive
impairment by surgical technique. In the second and third aims, the short-term impact of CABG surgical
technique will be determined based on domains of cognitive performance, and the associations among CABG
surgical technique, cognitive performance, brain infarction and novel serum biomarkers of brain health in a
cohort of 280 participants. Results will provide us with mechanistic details on the relationships between surgical
technique, detailed cognitive performance, acute MRI indicated brain infarction, and novel biomarkers of brain
health. Leveraging the international ROMA trial infrastructure, one of the largest cardiac surgery trials to date,
we have an unprecedented opportunity to clarify the impact of CABG surgical technique on short and long-term
cognitive function. Preventing postoperative cognitive impairment is an important public health concern that
could be mitigated with specific surgical techniques. The ROMA:Cog study will help to identify people who could
benefit from detailed cognitive evaluation and early interventions, and will establish whether serum biomarkers
can be used as novel surrogate end-points in future studies to prevent vascular cognitive impairment."
10877168,"Neurons lack energy stores and thus their ongoing function is dependent on the delivery of energy
substrates in the blood. Precise control of brain blood flow is therefore essential for neuronal
health. However, the mechanisms through which blood flow through the brain is regulated remain
unclear. Furthering our understanding of this process is critical, as it is increasingly appreciated
that disruption of brain blood flow is one of the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer’s disease,
and may be a key contributory factor to disease progression. Thus, advancing our understanding
of the mechanisms of blood flow control in normal physiology, and their disruption in the context
of Alzheimer’s disease, may reveal novel and much needed targets for therapeutic intervention.
Pericytes are mural cells that reside on brain capillaries, interposed between endothelial cells and
astrocytic endfeet. It is thought that these cells contribute to the control of brain blood flow but
mechanistic details are lacking. Based on the preliminary data in this proposal, we posit that
pericytes are ideally positioned and equipped to act as metabolic sentinels in the control of brain
blood flow. Specifically, we show for the first time that acutely isolated brain pericytes possess
functional KATP channels, and we demonstrate that these open in response to depletion of glucose
to cause contractile capillary pericyte, and upstream arteriole smooth muscle, relaxation. This
drives capillary and arteriole dilation and an increase in brain blood flow. This has profound
implications for understanding how blood flow is controlled in the brain, as local glucose
concentrations are known to transiently decrease during neuronal activity. Our data offer an
explanation for this phenomenon—during increases in neuronal glucose utilization, pericytes
sense falling local concentrations which triggers KATP-mediated hyperpolarizing electrical signals
that relax both pericytes themselves and upstream arteriolar smooth muscle. This increases blood
flow to compensate for the local decrease in glucose, thereby protecting brain metabolism.
Strikingly, this pericyte metabolism-electrical coupling mechanism is profoundly disrupted in a
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that loss of this blood flow control mechanism
may contribute to a mismatch between neuronal energy demand and supply, precipitating neuronal
dysfunction and cognitive decline. Using these findings as a springboard, we propose to determine
the molecular composition and metabolic regulation of KATP channels in pericytes throughout the
brain. We will define the precise mechanisms that engage pericyte KATP channels to control blood
flow, and we will determine the mechanisms through which pericyte control of brain blood flow
is disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease."

Eccrine sweat glands are the most abundant glands in human skin and are essential for thermoregulation and
water balance. Patients with severe burn injuries and congenital sweat gland deficiencies cannot properly
maintain body temperature, which can lead to heat stroke and organ failure. The recent identification of
multipotent stem cells in sweat glands presents great potential to help these people to thermoregulate efficiently
by opening the way for de novo sweat gland regeneration. Nonetheless, regeneration of fully functional sweat
glands will require better understanding of the endogenous signals that normally regulate differentiation of sweat
gland stem cells. Precise innervation and neuronal control are indispensable for sweat glad function since
neuronal signals elicit sweating, and further, as we previously discovered in our lab, these signals are critical for
sweat gland maturation. Sweat glands and neurons rely on each other for precise co-development. However,
very little is known about how neuronal inputs influence sweat gland development, especially sweat gland stem
cells. We hypothesize that neuronal signals are critical for the specification of sweat gland stem cells
during development. Using mouse sweat glands as a model, we will investigate the molecular changes in sweat
gland stem cells during development when lacking innervation, and further identify the downstream pathway
within sweat gland stem cells that mediate the effect of neurotransmitters upon stem cell maintenance. Through
combined use of mouse genetics, immunofluorescent confocal and light sheet imaging, single-cell RNA
sequencing, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and tissue explant and cell culture systems, we plan to: 1)
investigate the effect of denervation during sweat gland development and homeostasis; 2) dissect the roles of
specific neurotransmitters in sweat ducts and sweat gland development; and 3) understand the mechanism(s)
by which calcium mediates neuronal control of sweat gland stem cell fate. Completion of our proposed studies
will provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms by which nervous system influence sweat gland
morphogenesis and cell fate determination at each developmental stage, as well as better understanding on how
sweat glands and nerves co-develop into a functional unit. Ultimately, our proposed work will contribute to
regenerative therapies for patients suffering from sweating deficiency."

*This proposal describes an innovative treatment for hypertrophic scars that prevents and treats pathologic fi-
brogenesis after dermal injury. Hypertrophic scars affect tens of millions of people each year, including over 50%
of surgical patients and 90% of deep partial thickness and full-thickness burn injury patents. Current non-surgical
treatments (e.g., laser/cryotherapy, cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids) are painful and limited in their scope and
efficacy, while surgical interventions are invasive, expensive, and may cause recurring hypertrophic scar for-
mation. There is currently no optimal treatment for hypertrophic scars, as these options do not target the under-
lying pathology of scar development. We propose the use of human relaxin-2 (RLX-2), an endogenous 6-kDa
antifibrotic peptide hormone, as a novel protein therapeutic for the treatment of hypertrophic scars that targets
the fibrotic build-up of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in abnormal scar development. Importantly, we employ
a RLX-2-loaded in situ polymerizing hydrogel, whereby RLX-2 is uniquely linked to the hydrogel and subse-
quently released in its native form, to achieve sustained and localized delivery. Additionally, we describe detailed
mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies to examine RLX-2 as a therapeutic protein to reduce fibrosis in dermal
fibroblasts through: 1) impeding myofibroblast differentiation and ECM deposition by inhibiting the TGF-β1 path-
way; 2) upregulating matrix metalloproteinases that degrade collagen; and 3) downregulating tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases. We hypothesize that the sustained release of RLX-2 from a locally applied hydrogel
to deep dermal wounds will promote proper wound healing, reduce excessive collagen levels, and alle-
viate scar size and appearance (i.e., prevent and treat hypertrophic scars). Importantly, preliminary data
support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous experimental designs are established,
and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise are in place to address the hypothesis. The specific
aims of this five-year proposal are as follows. Aim 1 determines the MOA of RLX-2 in vitro in a 3D organotypic
skin model and in ex vivo patient biopsy explants to provide knowledge on the molecular signaling behind RLX-
2’s ability to reduce fibrotic scarring. Aim 2 develops a RLX-2-loaded hydrogel for localized and sustained topical
release of RLX-2. We will use our newly discovered method that harnesses intein chemistry to enable soluble
expression and purification of recombinant RLX-2 functionalized to efficiently conjugate to the hydrogel and then
release unaltered to the skin. Aim 3 assesses the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and efficacy of the RLX-2-
loaded hydrogel in an in vivo swine model of hypertrophic scarring, along with live tissue imaging methods to
examine RLX-2 effects on wound healing dynamics and reduction of fibrotic scarring. Together, these aims will
demonstrate the efficacy of a locally delivered RLX-2-based system to reduce aberrant scarring and will elucidate
the MOA underlying this activity. Furthermore, we will establish a unique protein purification-functionalization
strategy which will be broadly applicable to the sustained delivery of other therapeutic proteins."
10880999,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most prevalent retinal vascular disease worldwide causing visual impairment
and blindness in nearly 8 million Americans. Over the past two decades, the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF
therapy for proliferative DR has been studied extensively and has been shown to be effective for improving
visual acuity and preventing progression. However, studies regarding the impact of VEGF blockage on the
status of retinal vascular perfusion have produced controversial and contradictory findings. Central to this
dilemma is tremendous variability and weak correlation of treatment-monitoring biomarkers to clinical
outcomes. Vascular metrics such as capillary density and foveal avascular zone area as currently measured
have not proven consistently sensitive enough to detect and monitor clinical DR improvement or progression.
To address this knowledge gap, we propose the use of two non-invasive high-resolution retinal imaging
techniques to identify subclinical microvascular changes, quantify perfusion, and visualize cellular changes in
DR, namely adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) and optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA). In our preliminary work, we developed several highly-reliable retinal vascular metrics,
developed age/race/sex- matched normative databases, and showed that categorized perfusion changes,
outperformed currently available vascular metric for monitoring anti-VEGF treatment response in DR. Our
hypothesis is that our new approaches to AOSLO and OCTA quantitative image analysis will generate
biomarkers which are more sensitive and better suited to guide treatment by overcoming clinical uncertainties
in DR management. We propose to conduct a prospective cohort study using retinal imaging and clinical data
collection to 1) further improve our AO ophthalmoscope for precise structural and functional measurements, 2)
validate our custom vascular metrics for early DR detection and as objective indicators of disease severity, and
3) characterize short-term anti-VEGF treatment response in DR. To accomplish these important goals, the
proposed project brings together expertise in optical design and engineering, retinal imaging, and
ophthalmology."
10882154,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project develops artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) methods that provide real-time
monitoring and updating of clinical decision support (CDS) systems in order to reduce downstream health
disparities. As AI/ML systems mature and their use in clinical decision support continues to grow, so does their
potential to impact health outcomes on a population-wide scale. A particular concern is the reliance of AI/ML
development on retrospective patient data, which often 1) under-characterizes historically marginalized groups
and 2) contains systematic treatment and outcomes disparities that a naïve model would be rewarded for
reproducing. Against this backdrop, a growing sub-field of AI/ML known as “fair ML” or “ethical AI” has
emerged, dedicated to embedding ethical notions of fairness into mathematical constraints used to mitigate
undesirable behavior by machines. Although promising, current approaches struggle confront the following
challenges to ML-based CDS: 1) degradation in performance with shifts to clinical practice and care dynamics;
2) satisfying a notion of fairness without sacrificing overall model performance; 3), an inability to adapt to, or
integrate with, existing clinical workflows. This project focuses on developing AI-based postprocessing
methods that fill these gaps. We focus methods development on resource- or time-constrained settings where
AI/ML tools are used to prioritize the order and the type of care patients receive. The primary application of
interest is an operationalized ML system that provides early predictions of inpatient admissions in the
emergency department (ED) to improve patient flow and expedite ED visits. In addition, we evaluate the
generalization of our findings to multiple clinical endpoints, across sites, and with respect to time. The central
hypothesis of this work is that fair ML methods can improve the equity of clinical decision support models by
monitoring and updating their performance over time. In Aim 1 and 2, we develop methods for training fair ML
models on retrospective data and assess their ability to influence ED attending physician decisions using a
silent prospective study design. In Aim 3, we extend our preliminary work post-processing methods for
satisfying multicalibration, which is a measure of equity central to risk prediction. We adapt existing methods to
the real-time setting so that they can learn and adapt to streams of health data. We measure the ability of
postprocessed ML models to perform fairly and accurately on these prediction tasks across models, tasks,
clinical sites, and time. Aim 4 focuses on implementing real-time AI auditing and calibrating system for
prediction patient disposition in the emergency department at Boston Children's Hospital, where a successful
CDS system is currently in place. This body work aligns with the National Library of Medicine’s vision of
“sustainable computational infrastructure” and has the goal of reducing health disparities that may arise from
CDS via its influence on care decisions."
10882718,"Title: Computational Neuroimaging MRI for Studying Early Brain Development with Autism
Due to the absence of early biomarkers of autism, diagnosis must rely on behavioral observations long after birth,
leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Thus, it is of great importance to detect autism earlier in life
for better intervention. The increasing availability of large-scale multimodal infant neuroimaging data
(structural, functional and diffusion MRIs), e.g., Multi-visit Advanced Pediatric (MAP) Brain Imaging Study, Baby
Connectome Project (BCP), and National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), affords unprecedented
opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories of autism, potentially providing
important clues relevant to early detection of autism. Our hypothesis is that accurate characterization
(segmentation, parcellation, multimodal neuroimaging measurements) of infant brain MRIs acquired from multiple
centers will provide important insights into the origins and aberrant growth trajectories of autism and help identify
potential imaging-based biomarkers for the early diagnosis of autism.
 To fully benefit from the large-scale multi-center infant neuroimaging data, a major barrier is the critical lack
of computational characterization tools for accurate and robust processing of the challenging infant MRIs,
which typically exhibit dynamic and extremely low tissue contrast, and large data heterogeneity. Building upon
our existing research, this project aims to create and disseminate novel computational characterization tools
that will enable accurate segmentation of cerebrum, cerebellum, and subcortical structures, parcellation, and
measurements of infant brain structural, functional and diffusion MRIs from multiple imaging centers, and to
further identify imaging-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of at-risk infants. To achieve our goal, we propose
4 specific aims. We will develop a novel contrast-enhancement network to increase the tissue contrast and a
novel prior-guided transformer for enhanced and harmonized cortical and subcortical segmentation (Aim 1). We
will propose a novel joint super resolution and tissue segmentation for cerebellum, aiming to achieve fine-grained
segmentation results in an isotropic 0.4mm (or higher) space (Aim 2). Based on essential semantic features from
segmentation maps in Aims 1 and 2, as well as contextual folding features from cortical surfaces, we will further
develop a novel hybrid volume-surface parcellation framework trained on an innovatively augmented large-scale
and diverse dataset (Aim 3). Finally, we develop a joint clinical scores regression and diagnosis model with
attention mechanisms using multimodal features, including volumetric features from T1w and T2w scans,
segmentation and parcellation maps (Aims 1-3), surface features from subcortical structures, cerebral and
cerebellar cortex, and connectivity features from fMRI and dMRI, aiming to achieve high accuracy and
interpretability in autism diagnosis (Aim 4). We will freely release our tools and all our processed data, to NDAR."
10882302,"Project Summary
Effective treatments for COPD are disappointingly limited because the subtypes of this complex disease are not
well defined. COPD may be initiated by susceptibility of different cell types to pollutants, including epithelial cells,
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, T cells, or any other cell type. We have shown that primary human
airway epithelial cells (HAECs) with an arginine (HAECArg ) compared with a proline ( HAECPro) at locus 72 of the
p53 protein, express higher mucin levels and that the same is found in nasal brushings from humans. Single-
cell RNA sequencing showed that differentiated HAECArg show increased numbers of mucous cells while
HAECPro cultures show squamous cells. Therefore, genetic variants may cause susceptibility depending on the
cell type and the type of injury that initiates the chronic inflammatory condition. To begin investigating this
possibility, we generated whole genome genotyping and bulk RNA sequence data from HAECs of 185 individuals
cultured as basal cells. We identified 1,014 genes that harbored at least one expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) and 16 distinct loci containing known COPD-associated genetic variants including a region near MUTYH.
Based on these findings, we propose to test the hypotheses that multiple genetic loci associated with COPD
harbor eQTLs or protein QTLs that are active in airway epithelia exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). Colocalization
analysis of these QTLs with COPD genome-wide association study (GWAS) results will identify airway-specific
genes that initiate COPD development. Aim 1 will identify CS-responsive genes and pathways and link eQTLs
and protein QTLs to COPD-associated genetic variants, with MUTYH being the first identified gene to investigate.
Aim 2 will determine the role of the Tp53 variants in airway epithelial differentiation. Isogenic HAECArg and
HAECPro cultures will be compared for cell types by single cell RNA sequencing and investigate whether the
p53Arg or p53Pro variants facilitate a mucous or squamous differentiation process depending on culture conditions.
Mechanisms underlying the p53Arg-mediated expression of mucin genes will be elucidated. These studies will
help define pathways that characterize a specific COPD subtype and provide biomarkers for early diagnosis,
patient stratification. The data from HAEC185 will also provide a resource for future studies on any chronic
disease that originates from susceptible airway epithelial cells."
10882303,"ABSTRACT
Congenital malformations are a major public health challenge. These conditions are often linked to maternal
metabolic dysfunctions like diabetes and obesity. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that couple metabolism to
the genetic programs that control embryonic development remain poorly understood. Neural crest cells are a
type of embryonic stem cell that is particularly sensitive to metabolic perturbations and has been directly linked
to multiple developmental abnormalities. Neural crest development is orchestrated by a complex gene
regulatory network that endows these cells with their unique properties, like stemness, multipotency, and the
ability to migrate. Our group has previously shown that proper deployment of this regulatory network depends
on the initiation and maintenance of a metabolic state of increased glycolytic flux. We recently observed that
this state of enhanced glycolysis contributes to the regulation of gene expression through a mechanism that
involves a newly described epigenetic mark called histone lactylation. By examining the deposition of this
mark, we identified cis-regulatory regions in the genome that respond to changes in the glycolytic state of
neural crest cells. Notably, these putative metabolism-responsive enhancers (MREs) are located in the loci of
neural crest genes that are upregulated upon metabolic reprogramming. Based on this preliminary data, we
hypothesize that specialized cis-regulatory elements allow gene regulatory networks to respond to changes in
cellular metabolism. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. First, we will characterize the patterns of
genomic deposition of specific lactylation marks and test if these patterns change upon manipulation of
metabolic state and lactate levels. We will define how these manipulations affect the organization of the
epigenomic landscape and gene expression patterns. Second, we will examine how histone lactylation is
deposited in the genome of neural crest cells. We will use a combination of genomics and functional assays to
test the hypothesis that YAP/TEAD and SOX9 promote lactylation by cooperating with lactylation writers. Third,
we will test if MREs respond to changes in glycolytic flux by performing STARR-seq in neural crest cells
subjected to metabolic manipulation. Finally, we will use genome engineering to delete MREs in neural crest
cells and test their requirement for transcription responses to metabolic reprogramming. These experiments
will define how metabolic state affects the epigenomic landscape and modulates the gene regulatory networks
that control embryogenic development."
10882364,"Project Summary
Excess adiposity – obesity – causes insulin resistance (IR) in white adipose tissue (WAT) and other tissues. The
role of poor WAT quality in IR, however, is less clear. Low adipocyte triglyceride (TG) turnover, high formation
rates of new adipocytes, high senescent cell burden, tissue and cellular inflammation and high circulating free
fatty acids (FFAs) all characterize poor WAT quality. Exercise enhances whole-body IR and decreases fasting
FFAs, independent of reductions in fat mass, thus highlighting the significance of exercise effects on WAT quality.
Evidence of the direct impact of exercise – independent of weight loss – on IR within WAT is limited and
inconclusive. The underlying mechanisms that drive exercise-induced changes in WAT biology, such as new
adipocyte formation and TG turnover rates, cell composition, senescence, and inflammation, are poorly
understood in humans. Ours will be the first study to comprehensively assess the direct effects of exercise on
WAT-specific IR and WAT quality in vivo and ex vivo in humans. We have conducted groundbreaking studies of
in vivo formation of new adipocytes and adipocyte TG turnover rates using a metabolic labeling protocol that
incorporates deuterium (2H), administered as 2H2O, into the DNA and triglycerides of adipose cells. We now have
compelling published and preliminary evidence that exercise reduces in vivo formation of new adipocytes in both
mice and humans, suggesting an important exercise-induced mechanism of WAT remodeling. We reason that
increased adipocyte TG turnover rates improve adipocyte-specific and overall WAT quality and thus abrogate
the need for increased formation of new adipocytes. Using our established method, we will employ innovative
single nuclei transcriptomics (snRNAseq) to discover the effects of exercise on senescence and inflammation
within adipocytes and non-adipocytes of WAT to further understand how exercise impacts WAT quality and WAT-
specific IR via in vivo microdialysis during insulin suppression. In this study, we will perform a randomized,
controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of 12 weeks of endurance exercise on abdominal subcutaneous
WAT adipocyte formation and TG turnover in vivo, cell composition and WAT-specific lipolytic rates under
physiological insulin suppression in men and pre-menopausal women with obesity. We hypothesize that
endurance exercise will increase adipocyte TG turnover rates thereby decreasing formation of new adipocytes,
the size of existing adipocytes and reducing inflammation and senescent cell burden in adipocytes and non-
adipocytes within WAT. These cell-specific changes will play a key role in exercise-induced improvements in
WAT-specific insulin-suppressed lipolytic rates in vivo and reduced fasting FFA levels. By performing
comprehensive metabolic and molecular phenotyping of WAT in humans in response to exercise, these pivotal
studies will expand our understanding of WAT remodeling and how changes in the cellular composition impact
the overall metabolic health of the adipose tissue in the context of obesity and help identify viable targets for
interventions to improve metabolic health."

The past decade has witnessed a breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy, from checkpoint inhibitors to adoptive
T cell therapies, a new pillar in our armament of anti-cancer drugs now exists. However, our current therapies
are based on the premise that adaptive immunity alone, mediated by activated T cells, can eliminate tumors.
While the generation of anti-tumor T cells is paramount, many additional factors must be considered in an
immune response, including access of therapies to solid tumors, the role of innate immunity, and the suppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME). Microbial-based cancer therapies have the potential of addressing all of these
challenges that can impede the success of immunotherapy. This proposal is based on extensive preclinical and
clinical experience using an attenuated (DactA) strain of Listeria monocytogenes as a therapeutic cancer
vaccine. In this proposal, we focus on the direct impact of L. monocytogenes (Lm) on shaping the immune
phenotype of the TME. We find that injection of Lm intratumorally (IT) results in profound changes in the TME,
including the reduction of Tregs which we trace to activation of TLR2. Surprisingly, bacteria injected IV also
localize to tumors, but while bacteria in the liver and spleen are eliminated, bacteria injected both IT and IV,
persist indefinitely in the tumors, although neither treatment results in reduction of tumor volume. However, mice
previously immunized with Lm followed by IT injection, dramatically reduce the tumor burden, which we show
requires CD8+ T cells. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Lm injected either IT or IV localizes
and persists in tumor and increases the inflammatory milieu. Upon prior immunization, influx of Lm-specific CD8+
T cells mediate clearance of both the remaining bacteria and substantial shrinkage of the tumor, although the
mechanism remains to be determined. Collectively these data reveal the importance of both innate and adaptive
immunity in mediating a productive response to the tumors."

Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy produces fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) that are associated
with sensory and cognitive deficits. Individuals with FASD have impaired auditory processing and frequently
exhibit atypical auditory behaviors. Developmental alcohol exposure has been shown to cause impairments in
neuronal plasticity and GABAergic interneuron dysfunction. Parvalbumin expressing GABAergic interneurons
are surrounded by perineuronal nets that regulate their development and plasticity. However, it is not known
whether altered development of perineuronal nets and maturation of parvalbumin interneurons contribute to
altered inhibition and changes in the network excitation in the auditory system in mice prenatally exposed to
alcohol resulting in impairments in auditory processing. Here, we will use a mouse model of maternal voluntary
alcohol consumption throughout gestation to examine the functionality of the central auditory pathway, identify
region specific deficits in perineuronal nets and parvalbumin interneurons in the auditory system, examine
synaptic inhibition in the primary auditory cortex and inferior colliculus, and investigate hyperexcitability in the
primary auditory cortex in vivo. The goal of the proposal is to understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
sustained across gestation on auditory processing and identify auditory structures and cellular correlates that
contribute to the auditory impairments."

An inclusive and diverse workforce in genomics is much needed as it could alleviate disparity in
genomics data inclusion and genomics-enabled medicine. However, recruitment and retention of
underrepresented minority in genomics research and the biomedicine workforce are confronted by

undergraduate ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups face extra barriers that prevent them
entering this fast-growing, deep-reaching biomedical field. This AGTC (Attaining Genomics Talent Cloud)

diverse workforce by capitalizing on the long-term collaboration and geographic proximity of two higher
education institutions: Tennessee State University (a minority serving institution) and Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (a top tier research intensive institution), providing two-year-long intensive
basic training with intermingled research activities in genetics and genomics, and a full summer (10

Tennessee State University, in four cohorts, and they will be immersed in a genomic sciences education
and research environment, trained through a focused curriculum, and mentored by successful
researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Tennessee State University, surrounded by peer

10881589,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 37 million U.S. adults. CKD-
mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a common comorbidity of CKD that results in increased risk of
cardiovascular and bone disease and associated morbidity and mortality. Abnormal phosphorus (P) metabolism
is central to the development of CKD-MBD and is intimately linked with calcium (Ca) metabolism. Incomplete
understanding of the underlying physiology of Ca and P in CKD and in response to treatments is a major
knowledge gap that hinders research and clinical progress in CKD-MBD. P and Ca physiology is complex and
involves interacting effects of three regulatory hormones, calcitriol, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth
factor-23, on a multi-tissue axis of intestine, kidney, and bone. Despite the complexity, most human research
has relied on serum and urine Ca and P measures to infer aspects of whole-body physiology. Yet, prior work
has shown that serum and urine Ca and P are not reliable markers of whole-body balance or intestinal absorption
in CKD. Formal metabolic balance studies combined with isotope tracers can reveal the underlying whole-body
Ca and P physiology and, notably, can distinguish intestinal absorption from bone resorption and formation. This
project seeks to fill this knowledge gap through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the effects of dietary P
restriction on P and Ca intestinal absorption, whole-body balance, and kinetics in adults with moderate CKD.
Aim 2 will determine the effects of calcitriol, a key P and Ca regulatory hormone, on P and Ca intestinal
absorption, whole-body balance, and kinetics in adults with moderate CKD. Each aim will be addressed in a
clinical study using a two-phase randomized cross-over design with controlled feeding and metabolic balance
and kinetics methods in adults with moderate-stage CKD. In Study 1 (Aim 1), subjects will be randomly assigned
to a cross-over order of low and high diet P, achieved through manipulation of P source based on current
understanding that inorganic P sources have much higher bioaccessibility compared with P found naturally in
plant and animal foods, as recommended by current guidelines. In the second study (Aim 2), subjects will be
randomly assigned to a cross-over order of calcitriol and identical placebo. Each study will consist of a 1-week
run-in period on the controlled diet/intervention, 1-week full metabolic balance period with complete urine and
stool collections and oral and intravenous administration of P and Ca isotopes for kinetic modeling to determine
components of P and Ca metabolism including: intestinal absorption, renal clearance, and movement to and
from bone, with kinetic measures continuing during a third week. After a washout period, subjects will cross-over
to the second intervention period. The long-term objective of this project is to advance foundational knowledge
of whole-body P and Ca physiology in CKD that will contribute to progress in translational and clinical research
with the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with CKD-MBD. This relates to the mission of the
NIDDK to support research aimed at improving the health and quality of life of patients with kidney disease."

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogenous diseases, inherited in
an autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked pattern. With an estimated incidence of 1:2000-1:3000, IRDs
are the leading cause of vision loss in persons aged 15 to 45. To date, mutations in 280 distinct genes have
been associated with retinal pathology. Gene augmentation, editing, and silencing are the most attractive
therapeutic strategies for these patients as they correct the causative genomic malfunction. Currently, there is
only one FDA approved gene augmentation therapy for one IRD in this large family of retinal degenerations.
Our long-term goal is to generate novel gene editing platforms for IRDs. The most clinically advanced gene
editing therapeutic for retinal degeneration is EDIT-101, which uses a viral vector (AAV) to deliver the Cas9
endonuclease and two guide RNAs that target the CEP290 gene in Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10
patients. While this is the first in-vivo CRISPR/Cas9 clinical trial underway to treat retinal degeneration, the trial
is currently paused, suggesting there is room for improvement in the efficacy of this product either through
modulating the gene editing tools, or the delivery platform. Delivering the Cas9 endonuclease in the form of
mRNA, which leads to transient, robust protein expression, would mitigate safety concerns associated with
AAV-mediated Cas9. These safety concerns include persistent expression of Cas9 endonuclease and AAV
integration into the Cas9-induced double strand breaks. Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most
clinically advanced non-viral platform that can encapsulate mRNA and deliver genome editors. Systemic
administration of LNPs, that encapsulate Cas9 mRNA and a guide RNA targeting transthyretin (TTR), has led
to a 90% reduction in misfolded TTR protein in amyloidosis patients. To translate these therapeutic gains
observed in the liver to the retina, we first measured gene editing events following subretinal administration of
an LNP encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and guide RNA in Ai9 mice. In this proposal, we show significant LNP-
mediated gene editing in the murine retina. Additionally, we were one of the first groups to deliver LNPs to the
subretinal space of rhesus macaques and demonstrate their ability to transfect photoreceptors. To advance the
development of LNP-mediated gene editing therapies for IRDs, there are three critical gaps of knowledge
we propose to address in the most clinically relevant model, the nonhuman primate (NHP): 1) determine which
physiochemical features of LNPs facilitate photoreceptor expression of gene editors, 2) evaluate the
immunogenicity of LNPs in the subretinal space, and 3) quantify in-vivo gene editing efficiency in the
photoreceptors. Successful completion of these aims will generate novel LNP platforms that mediate the
expression of gene editors in NHP photoreceptors. This will lead to an understanding of in-vivo gene editing in
large animals that can be translated to specific IRD mutations. Overall, these studies will advance the
development of LNP gene editing therapeutics for IRDs."

Cervical cancer (CC) is a highly preventable disease and yet hundreds of thousands of women die each year
from CC with the large majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) are particularly affected because of the dual burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) and
HIV infection which interact with deadly synergism. Women living with HIV (WLWH) have accessed antiretroviral
therapy (ART) across SSA but have yet to fully benefit from integrated CC screening and treatment services.
The challenges lie not in any particular barrier to care but in the many gaps that occur in the cascade of CC
prevention from screening uptake to management of positive cases to treatment access and application. Clinical
research sites are needed worldwide to implement clinical trials that examine potential interventions and one of
the most ideal locations may be found at the Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya. Co-
founded by Dr. Michael Chung (MPI) and Dr. Samah Sakr (MPI) at the Coptic Hospital in 2004, the Hope Center
is one of the largest single-site ART treatment centers in Kenya having enrolled over 20,000 people living with
HIV (PLWH) with over 6,000 WLWH currently in care. The Hope Center has been screening WLWH for cervical
cancer since 2005 and has been the site for HIV CC research and many clinical trials conducted by Treatment,
Research, and Expert Education (TREE), which Dr. Chung leads as Executive Director. Based at the Hope
Center, TREE has a powerful physical, administrative, and laboratory infrastructure that has been implementing
HIV clinical trials at the site for over a decade including a study that screened over 6,000 WLWH with
Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and colposcopy-directed biopsy, randomized 400 to cryotherapy and loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), and examined recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN),
cervical shedding of HIV, and clearance of HPV over 2-year follow-up. In this proposal, Dr. Chung and Dr. Sakr
will co-lead the implementation of a clinical site at the Hope Center in Nairobi by Coptic Hospital and TREE that,
with assistance from Drs. Mary Nderitu (co-I) and Evans Nyongesa-Malav (co-I), will study interventions that
will: 1) increase screening uptake among WLWH; 2) improve management of women who screen positive; and
3) optimize precancer treatment for WLWH. They will achieve this by providing: 1) a pluripotent infrastructure for
accruing participants to network clinical trials from the Hope Center and a network of four Coptic HIV Clinics
throughout the country that are overseen by Dr. Andrew Nagy (co-I) for a total of 6,533 CC screen eligible
WLWH between the ages of 25 and 49; 2) insights and input on clinical significance and study feasibility during
concept and protocol development through the participation of Dr. Chung and Dr. Sakr; and 3) and on-site
operational leadership for the successful conduct of network clinical trials by TREE and its staff led by Dr. Rose
Kosgei (co-I)."
10885080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulated metabolic function and chronic inflammation are prominent features of obesity in both humans and
animal models. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a critical role in metabolic adaptation in response to stresses
including overnutrition, wherein the metabolic adaptation is disrupted and inflammatory stress is elevated.
However, there remains a key knowledge gap in the interplay between inflammatory and metabolic cues in BAT
during overnutrition. Obesity-associated chronic inflammation is characterized by excessive nitric oxide (NO)
production and aberrant protein cysteine nitrosylation (S-nitrosylation). Our preliminary data showed that diet-
induced obesity (DIO) elevates BAT protein S-nitrosylation, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This aberrant
BAT NO bioactivity is in part due to downregulation of alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5), the major denitrosylase
modulating cellular nitro-thio redox balance. Moreover, we showed that BAT Adh5 deletion suppressed UCP1-
dependent mitochondrial respiration, worsened glucose intolerance and increased BAT inflammation in mice
with DIO. All of these defects were improved by restoration of Adh5 expression in the BAT. These data provide
the first evidence that ADH5 plays a protective role in the BAT against metabolic stress. Thus, we hypothesize
obesity compromises ADH5-regulated cellular nitrosative homeostasis in the thermogenic adipose tissue,
contributing to obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. We will test this hypothesis by completing two specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanism by which obesity suppresses ADH5 expression and its
pathophysiological significance in obesity. In Aim 2, we will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying
ADH5-mediated BAT metabolic homeostasis. The regulation of BAT metabolic function by nitro-redox signaling
and the contribution of this regulation to metabolic dysfunction in obesity are new and unexplored concepts.
Accomplishment of this project will provide first insights into the mechanisms by which aberrant NO signaling
links BAT inflammatory cues to metabolic dysfunction and new avenues for developing of therapeutic targets to
ameliorate BAT dysfunction in the context of obesity."
10885084,"Nearly 3 billion people continue to use solid fuels (coal, biomass, animal dung) for household energy needs,
primarily in low- and middle-income countries. The household air pollution resulting from cooking with solid fuels
is responsible for an estimated 2.3 million premature deaths and additional morbidity burden each year.
Household air pollution emissions from cooking with solid fuels (carbon dioxide and black carbon) are also major
sources of climate warming gases at the global level. Our Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN)
trial (NIH UM1HL134590) is evaluating the effect of a free LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) stove and fuel
intervention among 800 pregnant women in each of 4 countries (Guatemala, India, Peru, Rwanda) on birth
outcomes and child health through age 1; data collection has been extended through age 2. The trial has
achieved excellent retention (92%), high adherence to the intervention, and a substantial reduction in personal
exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon, a contributor to climate change. Preliminary results
suggest the intervention improves length and weight at birth. Research suggests that exposure experienced
during gestation and early life is linked to a range of longer-term outcomes, and that the benefits of reduced
exposure will continue even if the intervention ends. Therefore, we propose to continue to follow HAPIN children
through age 5 to evaluate the effects of the original HAPIN intervention on neurologic and physical development
(Aim 1). Further, given that the intervention ends at age 1, we will continue to characterize the children’s personal
exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon (Aim 2), allowing us the unique ability to evaluate exposure-response for
several relevant periods of gestation and early childhood (Aim 3). The HAPIN trial is uniquely positioned to
address these questions, with a large exposure contrast during the trial and the generation of a rich dataset to
examine exposure-response given the expected heterogeneity in exposures among control households and all
participants post-trial as they adopt the various fuels and cooking practices typical in LMIC settings. The selected
health outcomes are supported by previous literature and have important implications for policy. Our overarching
hypotheses are that 1) the original intervention has longer term benefits for neurologic and physical development
after the intervention ends, and 2) that personal exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon during critical developmental
periods will be inversely associated with neurologic and physical development. We propose to explore these
aims and hypotheses in HAPIN children in Guatemala, India, and Rwanda (n=2,175 children remaining in the 3
study sites). The proposed work builds on the major investment already made in the HAPIN trial by evaluating
whether the benefits of the intervention extend beyond pregnancy and the child’s first year of life, leveraging a
well-characterized cohort in 3 diverse settings, providing rigorous and widely generalizable answers to questions
important for both science and policy. We are maximizing potential for success by extending our prior research,
using an experienced and proven research team, with strong and ongoing relationships with participants."
10885116,"Through the work of a well-established research partnership among the Chinese American Service League
(CASL), Mercy Hospital & Medical Center (Mercy), and Northwestern University (NU), our team completed a trial
evaluating a one-on-one patient navigation (PN) intervention for breast and cervical cancer tailored to Chicago’s
Chinatown. Our completed trial and others have demonstrated that PN is effective in improving consistency of
cancer care and addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) among underserved populations.
Unfortunately, current standard one-on-one PN is difficult to scale and sustain without intensive financial
resources, which limits one-on-one cancer PN to a temporary “Band-Aid” for fragmented healthcare systems.
We have an opportunity to apply our team’s lessons learned from our completed PN trial in order to create a
paradigm shift in PN to produce systems change in cancer care delivery to meet the needs of underserved
populations. To do so, we propose a learning health system PN 2.0 Checklist implementation strategy that
scales implementation of PN across cancers and builds a sustainable team-based checklist that will support
coordination and integration of SDoH-related efforts across community oncology and community social service
settings. In Aim 1, we will employ a design-thinking framework of co-creation and iterative prototyping to develop
the PN 2.0 Checklist, transforming one-on-one PN into a learning health system PN approach centered around
a team-based checklist that leverages the PN evidence base and active participation of community oncology
and community social service stakeholders. In Aim 2, through a Hybrid Type 2 randomized effectiveness-
implementation pragmatic trial, we will compare the effectiveness (non-inferiority) of the PN 2.0 Checklist
relative to one-on-one PN in resolving SDoH barriers and increasing patient receipt of clinical cancer preventive
services. N=600 Chinese adults recruited from Chicago’s Chinatown will be randomized to standard one-on-one
cancer PN (control) or cancer PN 2.0 Checklist (intervention). The primary outcome is an adjusted, composite
proportion of SDoH barriers resolved and completion of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended
cancer-related screenings, behavioral counseling, and immunizations, collected via chart review and patient
surveys. We will explore the effect of the PN 2.0 Checklist on organizational change and patient assessment of
care team quality using pre/post surveys. Secondary outcomes include time to diagnostic resolution and time to
treatment initiation. In Aim 3, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and
mixed-methods (process evaluation, qualitative interviews, cost analysis) to evaluate the implementation of the
learning health system PN 2.0 Checklist strategy. Results will have important implications for implementation,
sustainability, and scaling of PN in community oncology settings where medically underserved U.S. immigrant
populations, such as linguistically isolated Chinese, receive the bulk of their cancer care."

 Tissue resident macrophage function has emerged as a critical component controlling the balance
between organ health and disease. In the mammary gland, macrophages are closely associated with the
ductal epithelium and have important phagocytotic roles to maintain tissue homeostasis. Recent studies from
our laboratory and others revealed distinct ductal- and stromal-associated tissue resident macrophages that
contribute to maintaining the developing ductal structures. However, the important macrophage-derived factors
that regulate mammary gland development and the mechanisms by which these distinct macrophage
populations maintain the homeostatic state are poorly understood. The overall goal of these studies is to define
the functions and mechanisms by which tissue resident macrophages contribute to ductal remodeling
throughout distinct stages of mammary gland development. Our preliminary studies identify transcriptional
profiles of distinct macrophage populations in the mammary glands of adult mice. We show that two key
factors, Cebpb and Gas6, are highly expressed in ductal- and stromal-associated macrophages, respectively,
providing potential mechanisms for macrophage function in mammary gland development. Genetic ablation of
these factors results in alterations in the mammary gland during key developmental windows. We hypothesize
that C/EBPb and Gas6 are crucial effector molecules that drive distinct functions of ductal and stromal
macrophages, respectively, during key stages of mammary gland development. In aim 1, we will characterize
macrophage heterogeneity throughout postnatal development and determine the functions of distinct
macrophage populations in mammary gland development. In Aim 2, the mechanisms of how C/EBPb-induced
factors in ductal macrophages alter stem cell expansion will be determined. In Aim 3, Gas6-dependent
mechanisms of collagen homeostasis by stromal macrophages will be determined. Impact: Throughout
mammary gland development, there are critical windows that are highly susceptible to mutagenic events.
Although macrophages have been well-studied during tumor progression and metastasis, the mechanisms
driving tissue resident macrophage function during these key stages of development are not known.
Understanding these mechanisms will advance our understanding of how tissue resident macrophages impact
mammary tissue homeostasis, and provide insight into how disrupted tissue homeostasis leads to disease,
such as tumorigenesis."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related dementia, in which neuroinflammation is
highlighted to play a critical role in driving neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence has demonstrated crucial roles
for peripheral immune cells in AD pathology by direct infiltration into brains and regulating brain-resident immune
cells, including microglia. However, many critical questions remain unaddressed. Previously, our team developed
a three-dimensional (3D) triculture model of AD with human microglia to study the interactions between microglia
and AD neural cells. Although our 3D triculture model with microglial cells recapitulates robust neuroinflammation
and neurodegeneration, it lacks another critical player in AD pathogenesis, peripheral immune cells. Therefore,
we recently developed a unique 3D multicellular human Peripheral immune Chip (PiChip) model to overcome
this limitation. This 3D neuroimmune axis model faithfully recapitulates AD pathology with innate and adaptive
immune components. Our preliminary data from the PiChip model demonstrated a dramatic increase in the
number of human T cells (but not B cells) selectively infiltrating into AD cultures versus control. Infiltration of
CD8+ T cells into AD cultures led to microglial activation and it plays a critical role in exacerbating
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in 3D AD PiChip models. In addition, we discovered key roles for the
C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and its receptor, CXCR3, in regulating T-cell infiltration into AD
cultures. Modulating this T cell CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling pathway largely prevented neuronal damage in AD
neural-glial cultures. Based on these preliminary results, we proposed a comprehensive study underlying
mechanisms of AD-specific T-cell recruitment, CD8+ T-cell mediated neural cell death, and their therapeutic
implications, using 3D human cellular models, as well as relevant AD mouse models AD models. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to use our unique multicellular PiChip system to gain a greater understanding of the
crosstalk between CD8+ T cells and brain resident cells (mainly glial cells) in driving AD pathogenesis. We will
achieve this goal by addressing the following aims: Aim 1. to study roles and therapeutic applications for blocking
T-cell mediated neuronal deficits in AD; Aim 2. to study how CD8+ T cells trigger neurodegeneration via
activating glial cells; Aim 3. to explore the roles of T cell activation and clonal expansion in AD pathogenesis.
Successful completion of these aims will provide a better understanding of AD-specific mechanisms underlying
the interaction of adaptive immune cells and brain resident cells in driving neurodegeneration, addressing a
knowledge gap that promises to yield novel insights into better interventions and biomarkers."

Patients with cancer face unacceptable morbidity and mortality from sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated
response to infection. Oncologic sepsis contributes to > 15% of cancer hospitalizations and 10% of cancer
deaths in the US, with far greater morbidity and mortality than noncancer sepsis. Timely evidence-based
sepsis care bundles improve outcomes, but are frequently initiated too late or not at all in cancer, suggesting
that earlier accurate recognition may improve care and outcomes. Current approaches to detecting and
treating oncologic sepsis suffer from interrelated limitations including poor accuracy of sepsis prediction tools in
patients with cancer as well as general and oncology-specific barriers to their effective implementation. This
Career Development Award will support Patrick G Lyons, MD, MS, in addressing this challenge while
completing his development into an independent physician-investigator with the training and experience
necessary to improve cancer care delivery in the hospital. The overall goal of Sepsis Prediction in Oncology
Through Implementation Science and Technology (SPOT-IT) is to use EHR data to develop an oncology-
specific sepsis prediction model using machine learning and to use human centered design methods to design
and evaluate the usability of a stakeholder-informed implementation strategy for this model. These themes fit
with the NCI’s goal of “rapid development, testing, and refinement of innovative approaches to implement...
evidence-based cancer control interventions” and the DCCPS’s priority areas in healthcare delivery research
and implementation science
and are reflected in the Aims: 1) develop an oncology-specific sepsis prediction
model using machine learning on EHR data; 2) design and refine implementation strategies to improve
oncologic sepsis management; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to determine the early implementation and process
outcomes of SPOT-IT. These Aims link to Dr. Lyons’s career development objectives: 1) develop core cancer
care delivery knowledge, (2) enrich his knowledge in sepsis epidemiology and outcomes, (3) advance his skills
in machine learning and informatics, (4) gain advanced skills in implementation science and human centered
design, and (5) enhance his scientific leadership skills. Dr. Lyons will achieve these goals via a 5-year career
development plan incorporating didactics, fieldwork and experiential research, and intensive mentoring by Terri
Hough, MD (an international leader in sepsis epidemiology and pragmatic implementation research), Brandon
Hayes-Lattin, MD (an oncologist specializing in stem-cell transplantation and clinical trials), and Matthew
Churpek, MD, PhD (a critical care physician and informaticist with expertise in machine learning using EHR
data). Dr. Lyons’s experienced multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors, combined with the exceptional
research environment at Oregon Health & Science University, will provide the support and training necessary
to achieve his long-term goal of becoming a leading cancer care delivery scientist."
10886757,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 emerged in China in late 2019, resulting in the
COVID-19 pandemic. Like SARS-CoV (2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (2012),
SARS-CoV-2 can progress to cause lethal pneumonia. In contrast, infections with “common” respiratory CoVs
(NL63, 229E, OC43) are largely limited to the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 and in particular
the omicron variant, can sometimes cause primarily upper respiratory infections. Thus, despite their highly
conserved genome structure and shared replication schemes, human CoVs induce varying degrees of disease.
Respiratory CoVs initiate infection through the nose, though few studies have addressed CoV infection of the
nasal epithelium. We have an established cryobank of nasal epithelial cells from over 1000 genetically
characterized individuals capable of being expanded and grown as air liquid interface (ALI) cultures,
recapitulating the nasal respiratory epithelium. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that SARS-2 (and its
emerging variants), MERS and NL63 all productively infect these cultures. However, NL63 only replicates at a
lower temperature (33C), infects single cells rather than clusters (evinced by SARS-2/MERS) and causes a more
cytopathic effect than SARS-2 or MERS, suggesting it may induce a robust local immune response thereby
limiting its replication to the upper respiratory tract or stimulating an adaptive immune response prior to infecting
the lower airway. One COVID-19 risk locus includes the leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 gene (LZTFL1),
which we show is highly expressed in ciliated nasal cells, with ubiquitous expression throughout the cytoplasm.
Our preliminary data of SARS-CoV-2 infected cultures genotyped for the high vs low-risk LZTFL1 polymorphisms
demonstrate that LZTFL1 could play a role in variability of SARS-CoV-2 spread. In addition, polymorphisms in
OAS1, a sensor of double-stranded viral RNA that initiates the antiviral RNase L pathway, have been linked to
COVID-19 resistance. We have extensive experience in this pathway and recently reported that SARS-CoV-2
activates RNase L while MERS-CoV shuts it down. Based on these and other data, we hypothesize that
pathogenic outcomes of CoV infections are reflected in viral biology in the nasal epithelium. Thus, using
a battery of diverse CoVs we will assess differences in cell entry and spread, optimal temperature for viral
replication and shedding as well as host nasal cell responses to each CoV. We propose to use our biobank
to identify host and viral factors affecting the establishment of infection, host cytokine and nasal antiviral
responses and the contribution of polymorphisms in LZTFL1 and OAS1 genes in the outcome of infection. Our
complementary expertise in coronavirus biology (Weiss) and nasal pathophysiology (Cohen) uniquely positions
us to address these Aims. This work will contribute to understanding nasal CoV infection, the divergence of lethal
and common CoVs as well as variation in clinical course among SARS-CoV-2 infections, and may lead to novel
targeted prophylaxis or therapeutic strategies targeting the nose, the site of initial contact."
10886758,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Although many well-studied aspects of neural function involve activity driven by sensory inputs or occurring at
the time of motor actions, the brain often links such ﬂeeting sensory and motor signals with persistent activity.
Somehow, neural circuits and individual neurons are capable of maintaining activity without additional input.
This is a fundamental aspect of neural function and a critical building block of cognition. The mechanisms
underlying persistent neural activity have long been considered in both experiment and theory, but there is little
deﬁnitive mechanistic understanding of the circuit and cellular contributions to persistent activity. Indeed,
theories of persistent activity are far more biologically nuanced than current empirical knowledge— especially
in the nonhuman primate, from which our understanding should have greatest clinical relevance given the
number of disorders that involve persistent activity. Here, we propose work that leverages advanced
techniques for multiple scales (and speciﬁcities) of neural recordings with corresponding analyses of large-
scale datasets to test detailed theories of how the brain generates and maintains persistent activity.
Speciﬁc Aim 1. Establish the marmoset as a powerful complementary model system for dissecting
persistent activity mechanisms in primate brains.
We will demonstrate the viability of studying memory-guided saccades and persistent activity in the marmoset,
using successful training approaches, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging to elicit the key behavior and to
characterize the important brain areas in this exciting primate model system.
Speciﬁc Aim 2. Characterize the large-scale circuitry underlying oculomotor persistent activity.
Using large scale recordings of extracellular activity across multiple brain regions collecting during
performance of a memory-guided saccade task, we will acquire a dataset of unprecedented scale to assess
the large-scale circuitry underlying persistent activity. We will adapt, develop, and deploy advanced statistical
models to capture the functional interactions between neurons and brain areas.
Speciﬁc Aim 3. Test and reﬁne theories of persistent activity with novel measurements at ﬁne spatial
and genetic resolution.
We will perform both 2-photon imaging and high density electrophysiological measures of neural activity. The
imaging will allow us to test the local circuit components of the theory, as well as to assess cell-type-speciﬁc
contributions to persistent activity. High density electrophysiology will reveal the local circuit architecture and
signal ﬂow that are not accessible with coarser techniques. Integrated within our analysis framework, the
resultant model of persistent activity will be supported and reﬁned by multiple scales and forms of empirical
evidence, all collected in the primate brain."

 1 Current estimates indicate that ~30 % of the global adult population is affected by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
 2 (NAFLD). NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from hepatic and extra-hepatic
 3 complications, such as cardiovascular disease. Recent research has identified hepatic lipid droplets (LDs) as
 4 important players in NAFLD, yet their exact role in the pathogenesis and progression of this disease is not fully
 5 understood. One of the key functions of hepatic LDs is to store polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and regulate
6 the availability of arachidonic acid (AA). Recent evidence has shown that plasma levels of PUFAs and
 7 eicosanoids are associated with NAFLD severity and cardiovascular disease. However, the role of LD proteins
 8 in regulating PUFA metabolism and liver inflammation has not been investigated. To address this gap, the
 9 principal investigator (PI) will study common genetic coding variants in two LD proteins that may alter PUFA and
10 eicosanoid metabolism and, thus, affect NAFLD progression. The first is PNPLA3-I148M which is well-known as
11 a risk factor for NAFLD and associated comorbidities. The second is PLIN2-Pro251 which has been recently
12 shown to be associated with a reduction in hepatic triglycerides in a NAFLD mouse model. The hypotheses at
13 the heart of this project are that PNPLA3-I148M augments the release of AA from the LD membrane, increasing
14 eicosanoid production, liver inflammation and NAFLD progression, whereas PLIN2-Pro251 decreases the
15 release of AA from the LD membrane, thereby reducing eicosanoid production, liver inflammation and NAFLD
16 progression. Using a genome-first approach, in the K99 phase, the PI will conduct a `recall-by-genotype' study
17 to deep phenotype subjects who are PNPLA3-I148M homozygous without liver disease, and matched controls
18 (Aim 1); in parallel, the PI will use human-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated to
19 hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) to determine the role of PNPLA3-I148M on eicosanoids metabolism and LD biology
20 (Aim 2). In the R00 phase, the PI will turn her attention to PLIN2-Pro251. Further embracing a `human phenomic
21 science' approach, she will deep-phenotype subjects homozygous for PLIN2-Pro251 without liver disease, and
22 matched controls (Aim 3) and study the role of this genetic variant in eicosanoid production, VLDL secretion and
23 LD biology in human-derived HLCs (Aim 4). The PI will learn the necessary techniques to accomplish the
24 proposed research under the guidance of her mentors (Dr Rader and Dr FitzGerald) and Advisory Committee.
25 Her training will include 1) becoming proficient in designing and conducting deep phenotyping studies involving
26 genetic variants, and 2) mastering the use of iPSCs as tools to recapitulate metabolic variations observed in the
27 population. The PI will also gain a better understanding of mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, extracellular
28 vesicles, and flow cytometry techniques by working alongside specialist collaborators. Combining these new
29 skills with her prior expertise in LD metabolism, hepatic inflammation and NAFLD, will enable the PI to develop
30 a `big-picture' systems biology perspective, an invaluable asset in her future role leading her own research team."

Integrative approaches, including nutrition, to address pain suffer from a paucity of mechanistic understanding,
which often disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations. Affective modulation of pain in chronic disease
remains an unmet need, however personalized, accessible approaches utilizing diet may provide alternative
approaches for difficult-to-treat pain. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited blood disorder,
primarily afflicting individuals of African and Latin American descent in the United States. Pain is a major
comorbidity of SCD that can start during infancy and persist throughout life. Affective modulation in SCD is
associated with social stigma, discrimination, limited resources, poor nutrition, and social isolation. Experience
of pain is an outcome of somatosensory nociceptive inputs, as well as affective and cognitive state. These factors
may contribute to pain by attenuating the brain’s top-down spinothalamic descending inhibitory pain pathway
(DIPP) and may even interfere with response to therapy. Currently, high dose opioids are used for sickle pain.
We discovered that nutrition-based approaches using nutrient- and ω-3 fatty acid-enriched “sickle diet” (SD) to
target chronic pain ameliorate chronic sensory hypersensitivity and enhance spinothalamic pain inhibition.
Dietary manipulation is a potent modulator of endogenous cannabinoids, such as anandamide (AEA), which has
potent analgesic properties in the DIPP via dopamine (DA). DA plays a key role in the DIPP by signaling via
brain regions that directly inhibit ascending pain signals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We hypothesize that
nutritionally enriched sickle diet as an early-life intervention will stimulate dopaminergic activity and
ameliorate hyperalgesia in sickle mice with multigenerational benefits. In this MOSAIC K99/R00 (PAR-21-
271-010) I propose to evaluate dietary intervention as an integrative approach to address the issue of resource
and nutrient limitation as factors contributing to pain in SCD. I propose the evaluation of translational endpoints
as follows: K99-SA#1. Year 1-2. Use PET neuroimaging and spatial transcriptomics to evaluate the effect of SD-
intervention on functional AEA and DA activity in the brain and sensory hypersensitivity of sickle mice. Milestone
1. Stratify cell type distribution in SCD DIPP with nutritional enrichment intervention. R00-SA#2. Year 3-5.
Determine effects of dietary enrichment on offspring DIPP function and gene expression. Milestone 2. Establish
mouse breeding colony to continue independent studies and apply techniques from K99 phase. R00-SA#3. Year
3-5 Determine teratogenicity of perinatal cannabinoid exposure in SCD offspring mice. Milestone 3. Determine
associations between cannabinoid exposure and adverse outcomes and establish collaboration for epigenomic
evaluation. These findings will inform the development of nutrition-based clinical approaches and will form the
basis for R01 grant applications to study dietary roles in SCD pain as prospective clinical study. Deliverables.
Identification of SD as a potentially effective therapy for chronic pain in SCD and evaluation of the
multigenerational effects of cannabinoid exposure."

 This K23 proposal integrates research and training to characterize how genetic, neural, and environmental
risk factors impact treatment outcomes for adolescents using substances and engaged in related externalizing
behaviors. While substance problems and associated externalizing behaviors (i.e., violence, delinquency) have
a significant negative impact on health and development, empirically-supported treatments are time- and
resource-intensive, placing a high burden on youth and families engaged in treatment as well as the therapists
providing these services. Using knowledge from neuroimaging and psychiatric genetics can inform
personalized clinical practice, ultimately improving the precision and potency of treatment for these youth. The
training in advanced network neuroscience methods, advanced quantitative and statistical genetic methods,
and clinical and translational research, complement the research aims, which examine how neural and genetic
risk markers, identified from a large sample of adolescents, can be evaluated as targets and moderators of
treatment outcomes for youth with substance problems. The candidate will work towards this goal through the
completion of a research project with three parts. The first aim focuses on using data from the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to identify key neural networks associated with early externalizing
and examining how genetic and environmental risk are associated. The second part (Aims 2 & 3) involves
collecting neuroimaging, genetic, and phenotypic data from youth enrolled in Multisystemic Therapy (MST), an
empirically-supported treatment for substance problems in youth with severe behavior problems. Third,
comprehensive pilot data on family trios will be used to support future grant submissions examining
transmission of risk and impact of treatment on family systems. Etiologic findings from ABCD, will be translated
and applied in this clinical sample, addressing the following research aims: 1) Identify the neural networks
and genetic and environmental factors that relate to externalizing outcomes in youth, 2) Examine the
impact of MST on multimodal indices of inhibitory control, reward responsivity, and socioemotional
functioning in treatment seeking youth, and 3) Examine how genetic and environmental risk are
associated with MST treatment outcomes and 4) Examine the impact of MST on the family system. The
following training objectives will be completed during the award period to equip the candidate to carry out the
proposed project and establish herself as an independent investigator ready to conduct future projects
following from this work: 1) Training in advanced multivariate network neuroscience methods; 2) Training
in advanced quantitative and statistical genetics methods; 3) Further develop clinical and translational
research skills; 4) Improving professional skills essential for an independent patient-oriented
investigator. The proposed K23 will allow the candidate to become an independent clinical investigator
specializing in the application and integration of multimethod data analysis with treatment for substance use."

Many severe mental disorders with considerable disease burden such Autism Spectrum Disorders,
Schizophrenia, and Major Depressive Disorder are characterized by profound social impairments. At present,
there is little understanding of the origin of these social deficits, and efficient diagnosis and therapeutic options
are lacking. Advanced molecular and genetic techniques make the discovery of specific neural circuits involved
in social behavior possible, facilitating the development of diagnostics and novel therapeutic approaches specific
to disorders with social deficits. We have taken advantage of newly developed molecular, genetic and systems-
levels tools to uncover how specific neural populations and circuits involved in parental care, a social behavior
essential for the survival and well-being of the offspring are regulated according to the animal sex and
physiological status. Male and female mice show either affiliative or agonistic behavior toward infants depending
on prior social experience. In recent work, we uncovered distinct subpopulations of hypothalamic neurons that
are involved in the positive and negative regulation of male and female parenting behavior. The identification of
these cell types with high granularity provides us with unique entry point to further dissect how changes in the
molecular, biophysical and activity dynamics of distinct neuronal populations regulates parental care. We
propose here to exploit the precise cell type identification of neuronal populations involved in the control of
opposing infant-mediated behaviors and use high resolution molecular (Aim 1), neurophysiological (Aim 2) and
systems-level (Aim 3) approaches to dissect the entire circuitry associated with infant-directed social interactions

10887226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe infection is one of the top three causes of neonatal mortality, according to the World Health Organization.
Of infection-related deaths, viruses cause 6.5% in neonates and 19.4% in infants. In children under five years of
age, infections with respiratory syncytial virus account for particularly high morbidity and mortality rates. There
is an unmet need to understand better and modulate the unique biology of early childhood immune cells,
including cytotoxic CD8 T cells that act as a double-edged sword by protecting from intracellular pathogens
including viruses while also contributing to immunopathology during severe viral bronchiolitis. The functional
properties and the molecular basis for the unique features and remodeling of CD8 T cells in early childhood
remain largely undefined in humans, limiting the advancement of therapeutic modulators. Neonates have lower
CD8 T counts than adults, and their CD8 T cells have a shorter life span. Moreover, studies in the field have
found that neonatal CD8 T cells undergo rapid proliferation and terminal differentiation as effector cells at the
expense of forming long-lived memory cells. Both neonates and patients with an immune deficiency called
Activated PI3K-Delta Syndrome (APDS) suffer from severe viral infections and have similarly atypical CD8 T cell
function. We hypothesize that early-life CD8 T cells have a decreased threshold for PI3K/mTOR activation, which
enhances effector activity and augments short-lived effector cytotoxic T cell fates that can contribute to
immunopathology in severe viral bronchiolitis. By comparing human neonatal, child, young adult, and moderate
vs. severe RSV bronchiolitis patient CD8 T cells in vitro, Aim 1 will define mechanisms driving increased
proliferation, glycolysis, and cell death in early-life CD8 T cells and Aim 2 will determine roles of PI3K/mTOR
pathways in T cell function during RSV bronchiolitis and their relationship with disease severity. This research
will lead to further insights into how early-life CD8 T cells differ functionally from those of adults and what pathways
could serve as targets for interventions to improve immune responses and outcomes of severe early-life
infection.
Nina Brodsky, M.D., is an Assistant Professor in Pediatric Critical Care at Yale University School of Medicine.
Her career goal is to become an independent principal investigator leading translational research efforts and to
become proficient in developing targeted translational therapies to improve outcomes for patients who suffer
from severe infection and immune-mediated diseases. This career development award will allow Dr. Brodsky to
1) hone her skills in immunologic, omics, and translational research methods under the direction of a mentoring
team that is at the forefront of research in T cell function, signaling and metabolism and 2) identify promising
molecular targets for intervention to improve outcomes of severe infection for her future research."
10886268,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Distal radius fractures are one of the most commonly occurring fractures and represent a great morbidity
burden in the United States and worldwide. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) that assess patients’
physical function are the standard for assessing treatment outcomes and can help inform treatment decisions
for patients with distal radius fractures. Notably, however, PROMs must be linguistically and culturally relevant
to appropriately measure physical function and inform care. There are currently no appropriately culturally
adapted PROMs to assess the physical function of Spanish-speaking patients with distal radius fractures. As
PROM scores affect care decisions, mismeasurement from the lack of cultural adaptation can affect clinical
care and patient outcomes. The development and validation of culturally adapted PROMs for Spanish-
speaking patients with distal radius fractures will yield new knowledge about gaps in the cultural adaptation of
linguistically translated PROMs and provide the foundation for future R01 proposals to study the impact of
cross-culturally adapted PROMs on measuring physical function, subsequent treatment decisions, and
outcomes for patients with distal radius fractures and other orthopaedic injuries. By including patients from two
countries, we can assess the impact of culture on outcome measurement which may be generalizable to
patients in the United States and worldwide. This K23 Award will provide Dr. Shapiro focused training and
mentorship in three critical areas: 1) conducting psychometric evaluations of PROMs using mixed-methods
research designs, 2) understanding the cultural and linguistic influence on health and outcome measurement,
and 3) conducting trials of outcomes measurement tools in diverse populations. Dr. Shapiro has assembled a
team of mentors that includes: Dr. Patricia Katz (Professor Dept. of Medicine, UCSF), Dr. Alicia Fernandez
(Professor Dept. of Medicine and Associate Dean, UCSF), Dr. Theodore Miclau (Professor Dept. of
Orthopaedic Surgery and Vice Chair, UCSF). This is supplemented by a team of expert advisors and domestic
and international collaborators. We aim to 1) assess the content validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System – Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) for measuring physical function in
Spanish-speaking patients, 2) adapt the PROMIS-PF for two Spanish-speaking populations with distal radius
fractures, and 3) validate and pilot test the new culturally-adapted PROMIS-PF tools. This will be the first study
to evaluate the impact of culture on PROM items and to subsequently cross-culturally adapt, validate, and pilot
test cross-culturally adapted PROMs using mixed-methods design for two Spanish-speaking populations. The
new PROMs can serve as the foundation for future R01 proposals to study the impact of cross-culturally
adapted PROMs on treatment decisions and outcomes."

Existing HIV care systems in the United States, usually based on scheduled appointments, are often
inadequate for people living with HIV who have significant psychosocial and structural barriers to engagement
in care (i.e. homelessness/unstable housing, substance use disorders, severe mental illness). Rather than
connect these individuals to an incompatible system of HIV care, new approaches are needed that reduce
barriers to care engagement and offer increased flexibility. In this study, we seek to implement an evidence-
informed multicomponent clinical intervention that includes drop-in (i.e. no appointments) multidisciplinary HIV
primary care, mobile HIV care, staged escalation/de-escalation of care intensity as needed, and active referral
of patients from community-based clinical and non-clinical sites into this care model. This clinical intervention
will be implemented at four diverse care sites in San Francisco and Alameda counties, both priority
jurisdictions in the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) strategy: an academic safety net HIV clinic, a needle
exchange program, and two federally qualified health centers. Eligibility criteria include: 1) current HIV viral
load ≥200 copies/mL or off antiretroviral therapy, 2) history of poor HIV care engagement, and 3)
homelessness/ unstable housing, any mental health disorder, or any illicit substance. We use the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM implementation frameworks to guide
implementation strategy selection and our implementation and clinical effectiveness evaluation. In Aim 1, we
will use implementation mapping to assess barriers and facilitators of implementation and convene key
stakeholders to contextually integrate the clinical intervention and finalize the implementation strategies. In Aim
2, we will conduct a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study to evaluate the effect of clinical
intervention implementation on co-primary outcomes of Reach (any HIV primary care visit) and Effectiveness
(any HIV viral load <200 copies/mL) among patients referred to the care model over 12 months of follow-up
(n=400), comparing outcomes to two propensity score matched control groups (400 contemporaneous controls
identified using Department of Public Health data and 400 historical controls identified at study sites). We will
also assess clinic-level implementation outcomes. In Aim 3, we will evaluate and model the individual, clinic,
and population-level impacts of the intervention approach using heterogeneity and health equity analysis, cost/
cost-effectiveness analysis, scenario modeling of optimal and reduced component scenarios and population-
level impact. Our multidisciplinary study team has a strong track record of implementation research to improve
HIV care engagement among vulnerable populations. The proposed study will provide robust evidence for a
drop-in/mobile HIV care approach and strategies to support implementation at a diverse set of clinic sites. By
codifying these implementation strategies to facilitate wider-scale implementation, we seek to contribute to
improving EHE Treatment outcomes among those for whom traditional models of care are sub-optimal."

The opioid epidemic has been declared a national public health emergency. Current treatments have abuse
liability, target acute overdose only, and/or are ineffective for many people suffering from opioid addiction, and
new therapies are desperately needed. One promising target is the brain galanin system; reducing galanin
levels exacerbates morphine reward and withdrawal, while increasing galanin opposes opioid addiction-like
behaviors. However, the neuroanatomical source and target of this protective galanin have not been identified,
and the effects of galanin on voluntary opioid intake have not been investigated. The locus coeruleus (LC)
modulates the activity of the mesolimbic reward pathway and has been implicated in opioid addiction, and
80% of noradrenergic neurons in this nucleus co-express galanin. We have assembled a set of genetically
altered mice that either lack or overexpress galanin specifically in noradrenergic neurons to test the hypothesis
that LC-derived galanin suppresses the ability of opioids to disinhibit dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and attenuates opioid reward/reinforcement, as well as acts in an autocrine manner to
prevent LC hyperactivity and reduces withdrawal symptoms. In Aim 1, we will use in situ hybridization to
determine the neurochemical identity of galanin receptor-expressing cells in the VTA, and slice and in vivo
electrophysiology to investigate the circuitry and cellular mechanisms underlying the ability of galanin to
oppose opioid-induced VTA DA neuron activity. In Aim 2, we will use the transgenic mice described above to
test the hypothesis that LC-derived galanin inhibits opioid reinforcement using an operant i.v. opioid self-
administration paradigm. In Aim 3, we will assess the ability of galanin to suppress LC hyperactivity, cellular
plasticity, and aversive symptoms during opioid withdrawal. Completion of these aims will lay the groundwork
for LC/galanin-based therapies for opioid addiction."

 Cognitive and behavioral inflexibility are key features of many severe psychiatric disorders. One particularly
dangerous prototype of behavioral rigidity is evident in the relentless pursuit of weight loss in anorexia nervosa
(AN), a disorder with alarmingly high morbidity and mortality rates. Prior efforts to intervene upon psychological
inflexibility in AN have been ineffective. This may be due to inflexibility encompassing a broad set of cognitive
and behavioral processes that can result from multiple distinct decision dysfunctions that require different
interventions. Decision Neuroscience, which integrates translational and computational neuroscience with
economics, offers a promising new paradigm for enhancing the precision of mechanistic science for psychiatric
disorders. This approach posits that mental illnesses result from unique miscalculations performed by neurally-
separable decision systems that can be probed with neuroeconomic paradigms. This approach holds promise
for identifying precise treatment targets suited for different forms of psychiatric illness.
 Our pilot data derived from a Decision Neuroscience approach using a novel neuroeconomic paradigm (the
Web-Surf task) have provided several insights into unique decision-making processes in AN. First, on this task,
individuals with AN showed a distinct decision dysfunction suggesting overreliance on a rule-based decision
system, reflected through rapid decision-making focused on maximizing long-term goals. This approach can
lead to behavior that is inflexible and insensitive to current context. Second, this decision system appeared to
be supported by hyperactivity within the frontoparietal cognitive control circuit (e.g., dorsolateral and
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), which is involved in long-term rule-following. Third, these biobehavioral patterns
were linked to BMI and short-term weight-control behavior in AN. This frontoparietal-driven rule-based decision
process differs from other decision-making patterns (e.g., fronto-dorsal striatal habit learning) that have been
implicated in promoting behavioral rigidity in other psychiatric disorders, such as OCD.
 To extend this research to establish whether decision patterns distinguish AN from non-clinical and related
clinical groups, we will recruit: a) AN; b) healthy comparison (HC); and (c) OCD (clinical comparison) groups.
OCD represents a similar phenotype to AN hypothesized to be promoted through different decision processes.
During fMRI, subjects will complete the Web-Surf task to identify neuroeconomic decision patterns (e.g., rule-
based, reward-based, or habitual decision-making) in each group; these will be validated against other
decision tasks. Participants will then provide data on symptoms via interviews and ecological momentary
assessment at baseline and 12-month follow-up to examine the influence of distinct decision processes on AN
and OCD symptoms. This study will evaluate the specificity with which AN is maintained by over-reliance on a
frontoparietal rule-based decision system. This will permit first steps towards informing precision neuroscience-
based psychiatric treatments informed by decision mechanisms, rather than solely by phenotypic presentation."

The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway plays a critical role in the response to various cellular stresses, including
targeted anticancer therapies. This pathway is regulated by interactions between various members of the BCL2
family of proteins. In particular, BAX and BAK play an indispensible role in this pathway by permeabilizing the
mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). While BAX plays a predominant role in epithelial tissues, especially in
postnatal life, BAK is particularly abundant in normal white blood cells, leukemia cell lines, and clinical leukemia
specimens. Our previous studies have demonstrated that BAK activation is initiated by two distinct processes:
i) Transient binding of BH3-only members of the BCL2 family in response to certain stimuli (e.g., transient binding
of NOXA, which is upregulated in response to the NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat), and
ii) concentration-dependent BAK autoactivation, a process we initially described. Once activated, BAK forms
multimers that permeabilize the MOM. Our recent studies indicate that this MOM permeabilization involves the
action of a C-terminal lipid binding domain that is externalized upon BAK activation and interacts with the MOM
lipid cardiolipin. Counterbalancing this pro-apoptotic effect, however, BAK can be bound and neutralized by anti-
apoptotic BCL2 paralogs in lymphohematopoietic cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
specimens. Importantly, the response of these cells to BH3 mimetics, proapoptotic small molecules that
selectively bind and neutralize BCL2, BCLXL and/or MCL1, reflects which of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
member(s) constitutively bind BAK. Collectively, these observations lead to the hypothesis that AMLs with
higher BAK levels will harbor more constitutively activated BAK and will be particularly sensitive to BH3
mimetics as well as targeted therapies that activate BH3-only proteins. We now propose three aims that
will test this hypothesis and provide additional insight into the action of BAK in AML during anti-leukemic therapy.
First, we will assess the mechanisms responsible for high BAK expression in some AMLs but not others because
high BAK expression contributes to BAK autoactivation. Second, we will determine the biochemical basis for
BAK autoactivation and subsequent restraint by anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members because this partially-
activated-and-then-restrained BAK is the species poised to kill leukemia cells upon exposure to BH3 mimetics
and targeted therapies that upregulate BH3-only proteins. Third, we will assess the relationship between high
BAK expression, BAK restraint by various anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, and response of clinical AML to
a novel pevonedistat-containing combination undergoing early phase clinical testing, thereby assessing the
potential importance of constitutive BAK activation in the clinical setting. These studies, which build on our recent
advances in understanding the action of BAK at the molecular level, are collectively designed to enhance current
understanding of BCL2 family biology and simultaneously provide new insight into a potentially important
determinant of AML sensitivity in the clinic."
10886664,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Young adult alcohol misuse is an urgent, growing public health crisis, as young adults have the highest alcohol
use disorder rates of any age group with rates increasing in young women. Interventions for this population are
hampered by small effects, few options and lack of tailoring to salient risk factors. A recent review in Addiction
argued that research informing interventions fails to account for the complexity of relationships among factors
contributing to young adult alcohol misuse. We will address these needs by examining relationships between
two cardinal etiologic risk factors: impulsivity and subjective response to alcohol (SR). Despite theoretical and
biological links between them, little is known about relations between the two risk factors, or how associations
between them may promote young adult alcohol misuse longitudinally and on a momentary or daily basis. Prior
theory and evidence linking impulsivity and positive, rewarding alcohol effects have been primarily learning and
expectancy based. Here, based on exciting preliminary results, we posit an inherent, biological link between
impulsivity and high-risk SR (elevated stimulation and dampened sedation). This research is nascent with
multiple gaps in knowledge. We will address these gaps by examining impulsivity pre-drinking, SR and alcohol
use in a lab setting and via seven 10-day daily assessment periods over 2 years using ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) (N=250, 50% female). Using self-report and both lab and mobile tasks, we will characterize
3 unique, established impulsivity domains: poor inhibitory control, delay discounting and negative urgency. SR
will be assessed at successive breath alcohol levels using precision intravenous (IV) methods in the lab,
followed by opportunity to self-administer more IV alcohol. We will also measure SR at roughly comparable,
estimated blood alcohol levels via daily EMA methods. This design enables testing of SR early in a drinking
event as a predictor of in-lab and daily alcohol use, along with alcohol use and consequences over time, plus
SR’s potential role as a mediator of impulsivity/alcohol relations. Recent findings indicate daily changes in
impulsivity predict subsequent drinking and consequences. These types of changes are challenging to capture
with lab methods only. Daily measures also enable modeling of both person-level individual differences and
daily, within-subject effects. However, there are no published studies relating daily impulsivity and SR
measures. In this study, we will: 1) determine relations between lab-based impulsivity and SR; 2) determine
relations between daily impulsivity and SR; and 3) relate impulsivity and SR to alcohol misuse longitudinally.
We hypothesize impulsivity will relate to heightened stimulation and less sedation following alcohol and that SR
will partially mediate relations between impulsivity and alcohol misuse. Evidence of links between specific
impulsivity domains and SR longitudinally and on a momentary/daily basis will point to specific intervention
targets to ameliorate two critical vulnerability factors for young adult alcohol misuse. Thus, we will: 1) identify
mechanisms of alcohol action and 2) facilitate prevention and treatment research: two NIAAA priority areas."

By 2060, 44% of older U.S. adults will be non-Hispanic White compared with 60% in 2020. Cognitive decline in
this growing racially and ethnically diverse older population is a major public health concern. Blacks are
disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and potentially experience
a faster rate of cognitive decline than other groups. Yet, little is known is about the mechanisms underlying this
increased prevalence. Genetic mechanisms do not account entirely for the higher risk of decline and ADRD in
older Black adults, suggesting that other factors may explain this variation. However, the majority of cognitive
aging research derives from studies that have compared Blacks to Whites versus exploring within-group
variability in health conditions, biological, and psychosocial risk and protective factors that may account for
these differences. This study's overall goal is to clarify risk and protective factors underlying cognitive decline
in Blacks by: (1) Examining the relation between high blood pressure (HBP) and domain-specific cognitive
decline and exploring how serious life events and social support modify the HBP-cognition association; (2)
Exploring the relation between inflammation and cognitive decline and how HBP mediates the relation between
serious life events and cognition; and (3) Identifying the consequence of perceived stress on changes in
cognition and evaluating whether HBP and social support moderates the stress-cognition relationship. The
research plan will leverage valuable secondary data from two nationally recognized studies of older adults.
This K01 Award application will facilitate the training and professional development of Dr. Byrd to launch her
career as an independent investigator in the field of aging, cognition, and ADRD. The five-year training plan will
fill gaps in (1) cognitive decline and aging research and (2) stress and coping theories, while building on her
methodological strengths to include (3) advanced longitudinal methods. Dr. Byrd will complete the proposed
research in the rich training environment of Arizona State University (ASU), with co-primary mentorship from
David Coon, PhD, Professor and geropsychologist (ASU) and Roland J. Thorpe, PhD, Professor of Health,
Behavior and Society and minority aging expert (John Hopkin’s University) and nationally and internationally
recognized secondary mentors Peter Lichtenberg, PhD (geriatric neuropsychologist), Keith Whitfield, PhD
(expert on cognition among Blacks) ,Toni Antonucci, PhD (social relations across the lifespan) and renowned
biostatistician Wassim Tarraf, PhD. The proposal addresses Goals B and F of the NIA Strategic Directions for
Research on Aging, which calls for research that seeks to understand 1) the effects of personal, interpersonal,
and societal factors on aging and 2) health disparities among older adults. Our research has the potential to
influence individual outcomes as well as affect policies and programs aimed at improving cognitive health for
the aging population, particularly for Black Americans who are at greatest risk for cognitive decline and ADRD."
10886690,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive disease with dismal
prognosis. A near-universal oncogenic driver of PDAC is the constitutive activation of the small GTPase protein
Kras, which induces multiple downstream signaling cascades that together facilitate rapid cell proliferation,
metastasis and therapeutic resistance. To surmount the high energy demands of these activities, Kras also
triggers metabolic adaptations to promote nutrient scavenging from extracellular sources, such as through
macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a process by which extracellular material is non-specifically engulfed and
then degraded in lysosomes to produce end-products utilized by tumor cells for biosynthesis. This process
essentially confers resistance to a myriad of anabolic inhibitors. Syndecan-1 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan
(HSPG) upregulated on the surface of cells that serves as the key mediator of macropinocytosis in PDAC and
other Kras-driven cancers that includes bladder, lung, prostate, colon and breast. In addition to mediating
macromolecular transport, HSPGs can be found in the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) binding to and regulating
the interaction of numerous signaling molecules (e.g. growth factors and cytokines) with their cognate receptors.
The pro-tumorigenic activities of HSPGs are exquisitely regulated by enzymatic modification of their heparan
sulfate (HS) moieties. Mammalian heparanases employ hydrolytic cleavage of the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic bond
between glucuronic acid and glucosamine to promote the release of growth factors and enzymes involved in
ECM remodeling, invasion and metastasis. In contrast to mammalian heparanases, bacterial heparinase III
(HepIII) depolymerizes HSPGs through a unique beta-elimination mechanism that cleaves at the alpha-(1,4)-
glycosidic bond. Various studies have confirmed HepIII modification of HSPGs suppresses neovascularization,
macropinocytosis, tumor growth and metastasis. However, the inability to restrict HepIII activity to tumor tissue
has long prohibited its use as a therapeutic agent. Using attenuated, tumor-targeting Salmonella typhimurium
(ST) vectors, we have developed the first recombinant ST expressing functional HepIII (ST-HepIII) through a
tightly regulated, inducible promoter. We have confirmed the ability of ST-HepIII to suppress high-affinity HS
interactions, macropinocytosis, and growth of Kras-mutant tumors. In this application, we will: 1) Determine the
impact of ST-HepIII treatment on metabolite availability and metabolic-associated gene pathways in vivo; 2)
Determine anti-tumor efficacy of anabolic inhibitors in combination with ST-HepIII; and 3) Develop and
characterize recombinant STs expressing HepIII under tumor-inducible promoters for greater clinical feasibility.
Completing these aims will allow us to develop a novel class of tumor-targeting agents capable of suppressing
a metabolic process essential to the survival of PDAC and other Kras-driven cancers. Our agents may be used
to counteract acquired resistance to standard-of-care therapies that target cooperative anabolic processes and
positively impact survival for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers."

Over 46,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2018 and an additional 11.4 million abused prescription
opioids. This led to the declaration of a national public health emergency to address the opioid crisis. Excess
opioid prescribing by healthcare providers, including surgeons, has played a major role in the current epidemic.
Interventions targeting opioid prescribing in surgical populations have had only modest results, with none of
these specifically designed for rural surgical patients. Rural health disparities compound the complexity of the
opioid epidemic for rural surgical patients, necessitating the development of novel interventions in this
population. This project will characterize unique factors contributing to excess opioid prescribing in rural
surgical patients and adapt a multifaceted intervention to decrease excess prescribing.
The project proposes the following aims: 1) Identify patient, surgeon and system factors associated with opioid
prescribing following surgery in rural settings, 2) Characterize surgeon and patient perceptions of factors
associated with perioperative opioid prescribing among rural surgeons, and 3) Adapt and pilot-test a behavioral
intervention to improve opioid stewardship in rural surgeons. Through mentored research and career
development activities, Dr. Borza will prepare for a career as an independent health services researcher
focused on improving quality of care in rural surgery through the development, evaluation and dissemination of
tailored interventions and research informing surgical quality, practice patterns and policy evaluations. He will
acquire expertise in 1) performance measurement in rural surgery, 2) qualitative design and analysis, 3)
intervention design and development, and 4) responsible conduct of research.
As a surgeon with a Master’s degree in Healthcare Research, Dr. Borza is uniquely qualified to conduct this
work. This proposal addresses educational and career development gaps critical to securing independent
funding through a multidisciplinary mentored program with experts in performance measurement, rural health,
substance abuse, qualitative research, intervention design and development and quality improvement through
surgical collaboratives. He is supported by the robust research infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin,
where the Department of Urology ranks twelfth in National Institutes of Health funding, the Department of
Surgery Wisconsin Surgical Outcomes Research Program promotes the collaboration and success of health
services researchers and the Surgical Collaborative of Wisconsin offers a well-established, engaged network
of surgeons. In addressing excess opioid prescribing by rural surgeons, this award meets an urgent public
health need in an underserved population while affording the education and mentored research experience
critical for Dr. Borza’s development into a national leader on rural surgical quality and independent health
services researcher."

One of the most pressing challenges in modern biology is that of translating the massive amounts of
information on biological sequences that has been made available by recent advances in sequencing
technologies, into corresponding insights into the behavior of biological systems. Determining the functions and
physiological roles of proteins remains a major component of this challenge; for many species, especially
non-model microbes such as microbial pathogens, the fraction of the proteome consisting of poorly annotated
proteins may approach 50%, severely limiting our ability to even identify mechanisms of pathogenesis and
potential therapeutic targets. The massive number of poorly annotated proteins of potential biological
importance necessitates the ongoing development of efficient and reliable computational approaches for
functional annotation of proteins. Over the past few years, we have developed and applied several new
workflows for whole-proteome structure prediction and functional annotation of bacterial genomes, with
applications to laboratory strain E. coli K12 and to the minimal genome mycoplasma JCVI-syn3.0. Our
workflows are distinguished by the integration of structural information (including high-accuracy protein
structure prediction) in functional annotations, alongside classical methods such as sequence homology and
syntenty, and recent developments such as the inclusion of deep-learning based predictors; we find that
collectively, our workflows provide highly accurate functional annotations that are especially useful for ‘difficult’
protein targets without clear annotated homologs. We will now shift our focus to applying our tools to the
proteomes of bacterial pathogens, with an initial emphasis on uropathogenic E. coli. Specifically, we will
continue to develop our structure/function prediction capabilities to further improve accuracy and increase the
richness of information delivered (Aim 1), perform prediction-guided biochemical characterization of likely
virulence genes to assess predictive performance and identify potential pharmaceutical targets (Aim 2), obtain
experimental structures for proteins that are identified as difficult structural targets which likely represent novel
folds or unusual sequences for known folds (Aim 3), and test the physiological importance of likely
newly-identified virulence factors in an in vivo mouse model (Aim 4). The experimental data gathered under
Aims 2-4 will be continuously integrated with the ongoing methods development under Aim 1 to maximize the
performance and utility of the developed tools. The results of this project will include further improvements to
widely used and cited tools for rapid structure/function prediction, identification of specific virulence
determinants in uropathogenic E. coli and preliminary insights into how they may be targeted for
pharmaceutical intervention, and additional structural data of potential virulence factors that will aid in
structure-based drug design and improve coverage of existing structural template libraries to guide future
protein structure and function prediction."

Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN or neutrophil) maintain human health by rapidly eliminating the invading
pathogens. These circulating cells transmigrate across the endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) to enter into the
infected tissue and to clear the pathogens. Little is known about the role of mechanical forces which PMN
experience during transmigration across the endothelium. Our Supporting Data describe the potentially
important role of adherens junctions in activating PMN’s host defense function. We observed that activation of
PMN-expressed Piezo1 during paracellular transmutation induced calcium influx, which in turn, promptly
stabilized Hif1α and upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in PMN to program these cells to
efficient “killers” of the pathogens. These findings have for the first time linked PMN-expressed Piezo1 to the
host-defense function, leading to the fundamental question “how Ca2+ influx in PMN via Piezo1 program the
host-defense function of PMN?” In Aim 1, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Piezo1 signaling
pathway in activating the host-defense function of transmigrating PMN. Here we will delineate the signaling
pathways downstream of Piezo1 activation that promptly stabilizes Hif1α in PMN and programs PMN to become
more efficient bacterial “killers”. The studies will involve genetic analysis of Piezo1- Hif1α signaling of the
transmigrating PMN such as PMN-specific Piezo1 and Hif1α knockout mice. We will also determine whether
pharmacological activation of Piezo1 or expression of gain-of-function Piezo1 mutant in PMN is sufficient to
activate the PNM defense system in the relevant P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. In Aim 2, we will
determine the role of PMN-expressed Nox4 in regulating oxidative and lytic properties of PMN and in the
efficient elimination of pathogens in lung. These studies will address the function of Nox4 in PMN in the
mechanism of innate immune defense program. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will determine how
Hif1α induces activation of Nox4 gene and how Nox4 regulates oxidative and lytic properties of phagolysosome
and efficient pathogen killing. The proposed studies will be essential for understanding the regulation of PMN
host-defense function with the goal of identifying therapeutic potential of Piezo1 activators."

Many evidence-based preventative interventions have been developed to prevent substance use, physical and
mental illness, and promote positive educational and social outcomes among adolescents. Among these,
caregiver-mediated interventions boast strong effects that are mediated by effective parenting skills. However,
the impact of these interventions is severely limited by low rates of home practice of intervention skills among
caregivers. To address this research-to-practice gap, researchers have been investigating barriers and
facilitators of caregiver engagement, focusing in large part on intervention attendance. Strategies for increasing
caregivers' home practice of skills remain underexamined. Yet, caregiver home practice is a key component of
theorized intervention effectiveness and has been found to impact parenting behaviors and subsequent child
outcomes over and above that of attendance. Therefore, the next important step in supporting parenting
behavior change is to develop implementation support strategies for evidence-based interventions that target
caregiver home practice specifically.
This proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will develop and pilot a digital behavior
change intervention for use as an adjunct to an evidence-based preventative intervention. The “Modular
Engagement and Skills Augmentation” (MESA) aims to increase caregivers' home practice of intervention
skills. Informed by the theory of planned behavior, habit formation principles, and relapse prevention theory,
MESA will leverage mobile health technologies (mHealth) to circumvent and problem solve common barriers to
home practice including home practice intention, frequency of practice, home practice competence, and
maintenance of intervention skills. MESA will be developed as a smartphone application (i.e., “app”). MESA
components will be informed by a qualitative assessment of barriers to caregiver home practice and refined
through direct stakeholder input on design requirements to optimize acceptability and feasibility. MESA will be
piloted with 48 caregiver participants as an adjunct to Bridges, an evidence-based intervention for adolescent
substance use prevention and mental health promotion. Cluster randomized controlled design will be utilized
such that Bridges intervention groups will be randomly assigned to receive MESA (n = 32) or an active control
(n = 16). Findings from this study have the potential to improve caregiver home practice, intervention
engagement broadly, and ultimately boost effectiveness and public health impact of numerous caregiver-
mediated interventions."

 Despite the development of dozens of drugs since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the emergence of
drug resistance and lack of a vaccine or cure necessitate the development of new antiretroviral compounds. The
HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein plays essential roles throughout the viral replication cycle. After an immature HIV-1
virion buds from a host cell, the structural Gag polyprotein undergoes proteolytic cleavage and rearrangement.
The retroviral core is formed when rings of CA, held together by intra- and inter-subunit interactions, arrange into
a conical lattice around the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and enzymes. Since many CA-CA interactions are
required to form a stable lattice, CA is genetically fragile and a favorable drug target. In fact, compounds that
successfully target CA assembly and stability have recently been developed as part of long-acting drug regimens
and show great promise clinically.
 Following their release into the cytoplasm of target cells, HIV-1 cores undergo an uncoating process in
which CA subunits are shed from the core. It is now evident that proper uncoating is crucial for subsequent steps
in virus replication, including reverse transcription, nuclear entry, and integration. We have recently
demonstrated that destabilization of the CA lattice through mutations and CA-targeting compounds increases
the propensity to form aberrant virus particles. In these particles, the gRNA and enzymes are localized between
the CA lattice and viral envelope. Interestingly, this phenotype has striking similarities with the eccentric virions
that are generated by inhibition of integrase (IN)-gRNA interactions. We have shown that the lack of protection
by the CA lattice in both circumstances results in premature loss of gRNA and IN in a proteasome-independent
manner. However, the mechanism by which IN and gRNA are degraded upon loss of CA protection remains
unclear. Furthermore, recent studies have implicated that CA may shield viral nucleic acids from the host sensor
proteins that initiate antiviral responses. I hypothesize that tampering with the stability of the HIV-1 CA lattice will
result in premature exposure and sensing of viral nucleic acids in infected cells. Here, I propose to determine
how prematurely exposed viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are degraded in target cells (Aim 1). I plan
to determine if altered CA stability elicits a more robust innate immune response against HIV-1 and the
mechanism by which viral nucleic acids are sensed (Aim 2). Together, the results of these experiments will
contribute to a better understanding of the proposed role of CA in virus replication and evasion of innate immune
sensing."

Interpersonal dysfunction is an intractable problem in depression that strongly predicts depression vulnerability
and chronicity. Clarifying markers of interpersonal dysfunction and its biobehavioral mechanisms are
prerequisites to developing theoretically based and biologically informed interventions able to improve functional
outcomes. An established marker of interpersonal dysfunction is co-rumination–i.e., excessively discussing
personal problems and dwelling on negative affect in dyadic relationships–a construct linked to worsened
depression severity in both dyadic partners. However, the biobehavioral processes that unfold during co-
ruminative interactions remain unclear, precluding the identification of precise intervention targets. The proposed
K99/R00 project tests whether temporal alignment (i.e., synchrony) in language and neural oscillations
between close friends is a mechanism of co-rumination, given synchrony’s key role in communication and
bonding. The overall hypothesis is that linguistic and neural synchrony during a laboratory problem discussion
task (K99 and R00) and smartphone communication (R00) mediate the association between co-rumination and
depression, using simultaneous dual-subject EEG recordings (hyperscanning) and mobile sensing (to acquire
smartphone communication; R00 only). 76 adults (K99; 50% female, 18-40 yrs) and 110 adolescents (R00; 50%
female, 14-17 yrs) with major depression and one of their same-sex friends will be recruited. Aims will test
whether linguistic and neural synchrony are associated with in-lab co-rumination (Aim 1) and concordance in
depression symptoms (Aim 2), as well as whether linguistic synchrony in smartphone communication is
associated with in-lab co-rumination and depression (Aim 3). Both the K99 and R00 will additionally explore
whether sex moderates the association of synchrony with co-rumination and depression. To achieve these aims,
the proposed career development plan will build on Dr. Li’s previous training, with four goals to enhance her
trajectory towards becoming an independent investigator: (1) apply multimethod RDoC approaches to studying
mechanisms of psychopathology, (2) conduct mobile sensing and dyadic-level natural language processing
analysis, (3) conduct EEG hyperscanning and dyadic-level EEG time-frequency analysis, and (4) grantsmanship,
lab management, and interdisciplinary collaboration requisite to run a successful, independent laboratory.
Training will be accomplished through direct mentorship from experts in developmental psychopathology,
neuroscience, and computer science and formal coursework from centers and institutes at Northwestern
University. Data obtained in this project will (a) explicate the biobehavioral mechanisms of interpersonal risk
factors for depression, (b) lead to future R01 applications on the longitudinal predictive utility of linguistic and
neural synchrony for depression, and (c) give Dr. Li the expertise in integrating innovative methodological and
computational tools to study the transdiagnostic, interpersonal mechanisms of psychopathology."

Presbyopia, the progressive age-related loss of near visual function, is associated with a stiffening of the
crystalline lens. There are currently several investigational approaches for presbyopia treatment that rely on lens
softening or lens replacement with softer materials. Lens softening approaches are expected to have a
transformative impact on the field because they are non-invasive and they preserve the anatomical relationship
between the lens and other tissues involved in accommodation. They have therefore the potential to restore the
natural dynamic accommodative function. However, one of the fundamental roadblocks towards the
development of lens softening procedures is that there is currently no method available to directly measure lens
stiffness and thus assess the efficacy of lens softening procedures in vivo.
The goal of the project is to develop new technology capable of precise spatially-resolved non-destructive,
noninvasive and depth-resolved quantitative measurements of the lens mechanical properties in a clinical
setting. The technology will combine Brillouin microscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and Optical
Coherence Elastography (OCE) - BOE. The instrument will be used to generate the first age-dependent data on
lens mechanical properties quantified in vivo as well as quantitatively assess therapeutic procedures aimed to
restore accommodation.
Our overall hypothesis is that the novel BOE technology can acquire absolute measurements of the lens stiffness
gradient with the accuracy and precision required to detect both age-related changes and changes induced by
lens softening treatments. The ability to quantify lens softening in vivo will have a major impact on pre-clinical
and clinical testing, validation and optimization of lens softening procedures.
The project has three specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop a combined BOE imaging device for depth-resolved quantitative lens elastography.
Aim 2: Validate BOE measurements in animal and human lens ex vivo and animal lens in vivo.
Aim 3: Quantify the mechanical properties of the human lens in vivo
To accomplish our objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in optical coherence
tomography and elastography (Larin), Brillouin technology (Scarcelli), biomechanical modeling (Aglyamov),
clinical ophthalmic instrumentation and crystalline lens physiology (Manns, Parel, Ruggeri, Yoo)."

Economically marginalized individuals face multiple barriers to consistent desired contraceptive use.
Inconsistent contraceptive use in the postpartum period is associated with unintended short interpregnancy
intervals (SII). In fact, 70% of all SIIs are unintended and economically marginalized families are at higher risk
of unintended SIIs. SIIs increase the risk of poor postpartum mental and physical health outcomes such as
preterm birth, postpartum depression, and maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Contraceptive
education is one solution to improving consistent desired contraceptive use and the subsequent unintended
outcomes. When provided prenatally, contraceptive education can increase contraceptive uptake and increase
consistent utilization in the postpartum period. However, contraceptive education is not consistently provided
due to time limitations and availability constraints of traditional prenatal appointments. Yet, when contraceptive
education is provided, it frequently misses opportunities to simultaneously intervene on the social (i.e., partner
involvement, joint couple decision making and planning) and systemic barriers (i.e., paying utilities, job training,
assistance navigating healthcare access to consistent contraceptive use).
 Planning Together is a couple-based multi-level contraceptive education program to improve
consistent desired contraceptive use postpartum via (a) reducing social barriers (i.e., harness existing support
by including partner in the contraceptive education and optimize couple communication by teaching couple
communication skills to improve joint contraceptive decision-making and planning process) and (b) reducing
structural barriers associated with SDOH that can negatively impact consistent desired contraceptive use.
Additionally, Planning Together offers a flexible delivery method (asynchronous and synchronous components)
that will increase accessibility and scalability by the time constraints of economically marginalized families and
healthcare providers. Specifically, we aim to develop the Planning Together protocol using community-
engaged dyadic semi-structured interviews with pregnant couples and individual semi-structured interviews
with health profesionals to gain a variety of perspectives to increase the culturall responsiveness of the
intervention to the needs of economically marginalized families. Second, we will test the acceptability,
feasibility, and fidelity of the Planning Together protocol in a single-arm pilot test. Execution of these aims will
provide the first demonstration of the feasibility and acceptability of the Planning Together protocol. This
project will provide the necessary pilot data for future NIH funding (R01). Planning Together has the potential
to redesign existing family planning education modes to improve consistently desired couple contraceptive
usage, with the longer-term goal of reducing short interpregnancy intervals to improve the mental and physical
health of economically marginalized families."

According to the CDC, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death among 1-to-4 year-olds and is
second only to vehicle accidents among 5-to-14 year-olds. Moreover, non-fatal drownings which often lead to
permanent brain damage and other long-term deficits occur even more frequently and across all age groups.
A recent NIH Notice of Special Interest (NOT-HD-21-048) was issued “to encourage and facilitate scientific
discovery for drowning prevention.” This proposal is an answer to that call. The majority of drownings occur in
swimming pools and despite a widespread belief that swimmers are safe when lifeguards are present,
drownings occur year after year in guarded swimming pools across the country. The majority of drownings at
guarded facilities occur because lifeguards fail to detect and recognize emergencies for what they are (e.g., a
body at the bottom of the pool) rather than because they lack sufficient lifesaving skills or are somehow
negligent. Several years ago, our group published a review of the basic-research literature on visual
perception and cognition in which we identified multiple properties of human perception and attention that are
relevant to the surveillance component of lifeguarding. That work led to the general hypothesis that
surveillance failures of lifeguards are often rooted in fundamental limitations of human information processing
and that a better understanding of the specific ways in which those limitations impact performance could
inform the development of targeted training and operational procedures aimed at reducing preventable
drownings. A barrier to testing these ideas, however, has been an inability to achieve an effective balance
between external validity of in-the-field conditions—which is critical for a real-life task like lifeguarding—and
experimental control—which is critical for testing hypotheses. On the one hand, conducting experimental work
in field settings (e.g., at swimming pools or water parks) is untenable. Drowning events cannot be
experimentally manipulated for both ethical and practical reasons. On the other hand, model laboratory tasks
have proven insufficiently similar to actual lifeguard surveillance to generalize to in-the-field surveillance. This
R21 project addresses this barrier. It is to develop a virtual reality aquatics environment that simulates many
of the immersive aspects of the surveillance component of lifeguarding while also allowing for control and
manipulation of relevant factors. The environment will be validated by linking it to well-established and robust
effects in the basic literature on visual attention, while systematically building in many of the complexities of
the lifeguarding task. Success of this project will open a wide range of opportunities for research and training
focused on reducing the number of preventable drownings that occur each year and, in addition, it will provide
a path for conducting research on other real-life surveillance tasks."

 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal forms of cancer in the United States (5-year survival rate
 below 10%). PC patients are usually diagnosed with a non-resectable disease (80-85%) and have a dismal
 prognosis with a survival period of only 3-6 months after the diagnosis. Nucleoside analogs (e.g., gemcitabine
 and fluorouracil) and platinum-based antineoplastics (e.g., oxaliplatin) are commonly used as chemotherapy
 for PC. When administered as free drugs, gemcitabine (Gem), fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (Oxa) display
 significant off-target toxicity causing life-threatening adverse effects in many patients. There is an urgent need
 to develop new therapeutic strategies consisting of delivery vehicles able to target PC cells, limit Gem, 5-FU
 and Oxa off-target toxicity and improve the overall anticancer response.
 We have recently patented a platform that uses an unbiased and quantitative screening algorithm for the
 discovery and validation of cancer-specific surface antigens. Our recently published results show that
 Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1), a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily,
 is aberrantly overexpressed in PC and can serve as a PC-specific target. Our results suggest that developing
 a novel ICAM1-based precision nanomedicine can be successfully utilized to treat PC patients.
 We have recently developed a magnetic extrusion technique to synthesize endosome-derived vesicles
 called exosome mimetics (EMs) in a highly efficient and reproducible manner. Our EMs share the same
 biological origin, morphology, nanosize and composition with exosomes, a class of natural cell-secreted
 extracellular vesicles. Our EM synthesis outperforms conventionally used exosome isolation and loading
 protocols in terms of particle yield, batch-to-batch consistency, reproducibility and loading efficiency.
 In this proposal,we leverage our expertise in cancer-specific antigen discovery and validation, bio-
 nanomaterial engineering, and exosome biology to test the novel hypothesis that EMs expressing ICAM1
 nanobody and loaded with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa can be used as a novel delivery vehicle for PC therapy. We
 will synthesize EMs engineered with ICAM1 nanobodies that recognize and kill ICAM1-expressing PC cells
 and load them with Gem, 5-FU and Oxa. ICAM1-EM will exhibit increased tumor specificity and reduce Gem,
 5FU and Oxa off-target delivery and toxicity. These innovative studies have the potential to lead to the
 development of novel EM-based therapies that can improve the efficacy of current cancer drug delivery.
 With key experimental tools, in vivo models and extensive experience in place, we will address the
 following Specific Aims:
1. To engineer ICAM1-targeted exosome mimetics (ICAM1-EMs) using magnetic extrusion method
2. To determine the efficacy of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs in inhibiting PC growth and progression
3. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution of loaded ICAM1-Chemo-EMs"

 The placenta is a unique organ that develops during pregnancy and is essential for survival and growth
of the developing fetus. A major obstacle in understanding the role of potential mediators of placental
development has been the lack of a facile method for trophoblast gene manipulation in intact animals.
Lentiviral infection of blastocysts in cell culture [ex vivo] and subsequent embryo transfer is an established
technique that leads to trophoblast gene transfer. Despite its introduction several years ago, the use of this ex
vivo embryo transfer approach to achieve trophoblast gene modulation has been limited. This is not likely due
to a lack of need for these techniques, as it provides a powerful tool to assess placental development and
dysfunction. The reasons for its limited use are likely due to the requirement for highly specialized staff, the
technically involved process, and the need to culture blastocysts in vitro to infect before embryo transfer.
 To overcome the limitations of ex vivo gene transfer, we have devised and propose to validate a novel
in utero trophoblast transgenesis approach, in which nonsurgical lentiviral infection of blastocysts occurs in
utero and provides trophoblast-specific gene expression in naturally mated pregnant females. This method will
provide the ability to evaluate numerous genes in a rapid and highly efficient way to study the role of the
placenta in development and disease states. This method is straightforward, specific, does not require highly
specialized staff, and eliminates the use of anesthetic. In addition, the rate of pregnancy and pups/pregnancy
is the same naturally mated mice. Completion of the proposed aims will provide a new and powerful way to
determine the processes that regulate placentation and underlying factors involved in the development of
pregnancy-associated disorders in a highly accelerated manner."
10894480,"––– PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ––––––––––––––––– R21/R33: Genetics of Amphetamine Preference. ––––
Substance used disorder (SUD) is still highly prevalent in the US, and the recent pandemic has made its
prevalence increase even more. Genetic factors account for a substantial driving force for the development of
SUD, and in recent years ~50 human genes have been associated with psychostimulant use in numerous
genetic studies. Many of these genes have not previously been studied for their role in SUD, neither in human
samples, nor in model organisms. Thus, their causative role in driving the development of SUD has yet to be
elucidated. Furthermore, some associations have highlighted single nucleotide polymorphisms between two
human genes, rendering the question of causality even harder to determine. This gap has also been
highlighted by funding agencies, and it has led NIDA to issue a Program Announcement for the “Functional
Validation and/or Characterization of Genes or Variants Implicated in Substance Use Disorders” (NIDA PAR-
23-041). The vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a genetic model organism for more than a
hundred years. Major strides have been made in the last 15 years studying the behavioral responses to
alcohol and other drugs of abuse in flies. This applies regarding the characterization of novel genes and
pathways that are also conserved in humans, and it applies for the development of new assays that resemble
endophenotypes of addiction more closely as well. Based on our recent development of a robust experience-
dependent amphetamine preference (EDAP) assay with high throughput, we here propose to test 20 human
candidate SUD genes for their in vivo role in the development of amphetamine preference (Aim1/R21 phase).
In order to progress to the R33 phase of the proposal, we will validate ≥1 human candidate SUD gene for an
amphetamine preference phenotype in concordant, independent replication experiments that use two distinct
tools of genetic manipulation, for example, one short-guide RNA for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out
generation and one RNA-interference line to cause gene knock down. In the following R33 phase we propose
to functionally characterize 1-3 candidate SUD genes. We will test predicted interaction partners for their role
in amphetamine preference, identify the conserved neurotransmitter systems that require these genes for wild-
type amphetamine preference, and will determine effects on RNA levels and on genome accessibility.
Together, these data will both validate genes implicated in SUD and lead to the “identification of new targets
for future addiction therapeutics” (NIDA PAR-23-041)."

The loss of CNS myelin, which is produced and maintained by oligodendrocytes, is a critical aspect of a wide
range of neurological conditions and results in the altered electrophysiology of the damaged axonal unit.
Moreover, the resulting myelin debris impede intrinsic efforts to remyelinate the demyelinated axons, and these
debris, which are engulfed by microglia, also activate an innate immune response, leading to further inflammatory
CNS damage. The studies described in this proposal are centered on three aspects of demyelination: activation,
the process by which oligodendrocytes are damaged; protection, the effort to shield oligodendrocytes from
factors that lead to their dysfunction and/or demise; and correction, the process by which demyelinated axons
are remyelinated. This R35 proposal represents a convergence of four separate, NINDS-supported, studies
centered on various aspects of the function and dysfunction of oligodendrocytes. This umbrella award will allow
us to focus our energy on how our understanding of oligodendrocyte biology, gained through these awards, can
be channeled into a deeper understanding of the harmful impact of demyelination on the CNS, as well as how
this damage can be reduced and repaired. These efforts will benefit from access to the inducible, genetic,
oligodendrocyte ablation mouse model (DTA) that we developed. In addition to providing a model of acute
oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination followed by robust remyelination, DTA mice develop a late-onset,
autoimmune demyelinating stage that mimics various aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocyte
protection by the integrated stress response (ISR) has been a major theme of our research efforts for over two
decades, and we will extend this line of research in the proposed studies. Moreover, our funded studies have
uncovered the critical role of the zinc finger protein ZFP24, as well as the reversible methylation of mRNA, in the
molecular control of oligodendrocyte development and function. These insights will benefit our efforts to better
understand and enhance the CNS remyelination process. Together, our planned studies should significantly
advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of demyelination and remyelination, which are of
considerable relevance to a wide range of neurological disorders that result in disrupted CNS myelin."

 Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins play a key modulatory role in G Protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) signaling. Through both G protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms, RGS proteins play
important roles in disease, and this has driven numerous efforts to pharmacologically target their function. These
efforts are, however, hindered by the fact that RGS proteins are considered difficult drug targets, and identifying
mechanisms that control RGS protein activity, expression and/or subcellular localization has therefore become
an important area of investigation. Our long-term goal is to determine how levels and activity of RGS proteins is
regulated, with a view of identifying druggable “soft-spots” within the regulatory network. Our rationale for the
current proposal is that identification of specific mechanisms regulating RGS2 will uncover therapeutic points of
intervention to increase RGS protein levels and activity. Low RGS2 protein levels or activity are associated with
a wide range of pathologies, including hypertension, heart failure and asthma, and our central hypothesis is that
pharmacologically enhancing RGS2 protein levels would have broad clinical implications. Our objective in this
proposal is to decipher posttranslational mechanisms regulating expression, activity and subcellular localization
of RGS2. We will focus on two crucial, but understudied, mechanisms regulating RGS2 protein levels and activity;
proteasomal degradation and phosphorylation. We identified a Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) targeting RGS2 for
proteasomal degradation, and recently identified the degron in RGS2 that is recognized by F-box only protein
44 (FBXO44), the substrate-recognizing component of the CRL. In Aim 1 we will use biochemical and structural
approaches to determine how FBXO44 interacts with RGS2. We will also determine whether FBXO44-RGS2
binding is determined by the associated CRL. FBXO44 degrades RGS2 only in the context of a CUL4B/DDB1,
but not a CUL1/Skp1 complex in cells suggesting that FBXO44 RGS2 specificity may depend on the nature of
the CRL. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of phosphorylation for RGS2 function. Phosphorylation plays a
central role in signal transduction cascades, however there is a lack of comprehensive information on the global
role of phosphorylation for RGS2 protein function. Our previous studies identified potential importance for PKC
and Src kinase in regulating RGS2. We will determine which residues are phosphorylated, as well as the
consequence for RGS2 protein stability, using a wide range of techniques, including PhosTag gel
electrophoresis, in vitro kinase activity assays, as well as LC-MS. In Aim 3 we will determine the functional
consequences of altered posttranslational RGS2 regulation. We will determine effects on G protein-dependent
and -independent RGS2 functions in both transfected cells, physiologically relevant cell lines and ex vivo models.
The expected outcome of these studies will be a detailed view of how RGS2 protein levels, activity and
subcellular localization is regulated by posttranslational mechanisms. Through these efforts, we will make
important inroads to future drug discovery efforts targeting RGS2."

 Infants born following intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at risk for the development of cerebral
palsy (CP). However, it is not precisely understood how perinatal neurologic injury due to IUGR results in
motor dysfunction. Using a novel thromboxane A2 (TXA2) murine model of IUGR, we have previously
demonstrated significant downregulation of major myelin genes (MoBP, PLP1, CNPase, MOG) in whole brain,
decreased corticospinal tract (CST) volume in the brain, and impaired gait. The most profound injury occurred
when IUGR was combined with postnatal hyperoxia exposure, suggesting a “double hit” mechanism. These
findings support a model in which transcriptional changes occur after IUGR that alter oligodendrocytes (OL)
making them more susceptible to hyperoxia. Our findings lead us to the central hypothesis that IUGR with
postnatal hyperoxia results in cell specific changes to the OL transcriptome that lead to pathologic changes to
the CST and motor deficits seen in CP. In Aim 1, in vivo genetic and biochemical methods will be employed in
this model to determine how IUGR/postnatal hyperoxia change the OL transcriptome. This aim will add further
understanding to the underlying causes of white matter (WM) injury after IUGR. As CST is known to be
disturbed in spastic CP, the most common type of CP in perinatal brain injury, Aim 2 will evaluate CST
development using advanced in vivo imaging techniques to demonstrate how IUGR/postnatal hyperoxia alter
development of descending motor tracts in the spinal cord. In Aim 3, altered motor input resulting in distal limb
movement abnormalities and increased hyperreflexia/ spasms will be quantified using novel motor tests. The
innovative motor testing employed in this aim will provide the means to rigorously quantify motor dysfunction
resulting from our injury model and compare it to motor dysfunction seen in CP.
 This study will impact the field by 1) providing insight into specific changes to the OL transcriptome
leading to abnormal myelination and CST development and 2) expanding the understanding of the
development of the CP phenotype in IUGR. This study is significant because of its quantitative approach to
imaging modalities and motor assessments that can be applied more broadly to other murine models of
perinatal brain injury and provide a basis for investigating novel therapeutic interventions in humans. Finally,
this study will provide an excellent vehicle for the applicant to develop into an independent investigator.
Investigations will be performed in an environment with an established history of successful mentorship of
junior faculty to independence. With the support of this application, the applicant will 1) advance her technical
skills (RiboTag RNA isolation, next generation sequencing, murine MRI, electromyography and kinematic
testing techniques) and 2) learn advanced biostatistics. Future independent studies will focus on the interplay
between pathways altered by IUGR/hyperoxia in WM development and potential therapeutic interventions that
can be directly tested in the murine models and ultimately neonatal patients."

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective intervention for treating patients with psychiatric disorders.
Specifically, it is an established treatment for patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) with a lack of
responsiveness to at least two pharmacologic antidepressants. Despite an efficacy of up to 70%, little is known
about the circuit-level mechanisms through which ECT alleviates psychiatric symptoms or exerts cognitive
impairments. ECT induces generalized seizures and causes neuroplastic changes within functional networks. A
better understanding of ECT is urgently needed given that it is a repetitive procedure performed under general
anesthesia and its benefits are limited by cognitive impairment following treatment. Electroencephalography
(EEG) enables capturing the temporal dynamics of brain activity in different states of arousal and recent
developments in high-density EEG technology allow for elucidation of large-scale functional brain networks.
Recording EEG during sleep provides insights about sleep structure. In this study, “Disruptions of Brain networks
and Sleep by Electroconvulsive Therapy,” we will investigate the impact of ECT on information transfer efficiency
in functional networks in relation to sleep slow waves, an EEG marker of synaptic plasticity. The novelty of this
proposal stems from our focus on the longitudinal assessment of EEG markers during sleep, wakefulness, and
ECT-induced seizures over the course of therapy. We will also acquire depression severity outcomes and
memory measures longitudinally. Wireless wearable devices will address previous barriers to the longitudinal
study of sleep microstructure in the outpatient ECT settings. Graph-based network analyses of high-density EEG
signals allow characterization of information transfer over functional networks. These information measures are
investigated locally in specific subnetworks and globally over large-scale functional networks. Longitudinal
assessments of EEG throughout the course of ECT alongside clinical and cognitive outcomes will provide a
unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying the development of
cognitive impairments and antidepressant effects incurred during ECT. Furthermore, our findings may shed light
on other non-invasive interventions targeting sleep slow wave activity in patients with psychiatric illnesses.
Overall, elucidating the impact of ECT on information processing in different states of arousal may have
promising clinical implications through identification of potential new biomarkers and therapeutic targets leading
to the improvement of public health for TRD patients."
10893701,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes and is the leading cause of
vision loss in working-aged adults. DR is classified into non-proliferative DR and proliferative DR. In the non-
proliferative stage, damage to retinal capillaries results in a lack of oxygen to the tissue. When capillary loss is
significant, patients progress to the proliferative stage of disease, which is characterized by neovascularization,
or growth of new blood vessels. These vessels do not function properly and cause bleeding into the retina and
subsequent vision loss. While there are treatments for proliferative DR, there are none for non-proliferative DR,
a stage at which vision loss could still be prevented for millions of patients. The lack of treatments is due to a
lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to disease development.
 The literature demonstrates that inflammation may contribute to disease pathogenesis. C-chemokine
ligand 2 (CCL2) is the most consistently elevated chemokine in intraocular patient samples from all stages of
DR. Studies have also shown that leukostasis, or the firm attachment of leukocytes to the retinal vasculature,
results in endothelial cell damage. However, there is a gap in knowledge in the field regarding how leukocytes
promote capillary degeneration, which leukocytes are responsible, where this occurs, and which interactions
between leukocytes and endothelial cells are necessary for DR pathogenesis. Investigating the inflammatory
cascade beyond leukostasis could elucidate additional steps that can be targeted, reducing ischemia and
thereby preventing vision loss from advanced disease.
 Based on the premise that static intravascular myeloid cells do not generally harm endothelial cells, but
when they do (e.g. vasculitis) the damage is immediate and histologically obvious, our central hypothesis is
CCR2-responsive myeloid cell transmigration is critical for DR progression, and blocking transmigration may
prevent disease progression. We will test our hypothesis through two Specific Aims: (1) Determine whether
and when blockade of CCL2-driven myeloid cell infiltration will halt the progression of inflammation in the
mouse retina, and (2) Determine if blocking leukocyte-endothelial interactions early in the DR disease course
can reduce DR progression. In Aim 1 we will use an acute model of inflammation induced by CCL2 intravitreal
injections; in Aim 2 we will use a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. We will compare the effects of
blocking leukocyte transmigration versus adhesion on DR progression, measured by markers of endothelial
cell apoptosis, tight junction integrity, microglial activation, and leukostasis. We will adapt our intravital
microscopy system to observe leukocyte dynamics in real time serially in the retinas of live mice with DR. The
information obtained from this project will improve our understanding of the role of innate immunity on disease
progression and aid in development of novel therapies for non-proliferative DR."

bioinformatics applications in a non-academic setting. Objectives of the program are to: 1) Implement a new
structured Bioinformatics MSc curriculum, including TB Biology modules, with a strong research training compo-
nent, 2) Train students that are well versed in conducting responsible, rigorous and reproducible research, 3)
Implement a trainee career development and mentorship program, and its evaluation framework, 4) Strengthen
and expand low- and middle-income country (LMIC) and US TB Bioinformatics partnerships, and 5) Implement
a faculty development program, and its evaluation process. During the D71 planning phase, a new Bioinformatics
curriculum with emphasis on TB was developed. This 2-year MSc program will offer a vigorous coursework
component followed by a research project mentored by world-class TB scientists. The MSc program will include
a 9-month lecture block (including Statistics, Bioinformatics and TB Biology). Trainees will then be embedded
within the SU host laboratory with a 2-month visit to the laboratory of a US-based host, and they will carry out a
bioinformatics research project. The program incorporates career development activities for trainees and faculty
development initiatives for mentors and LMIC partners. The program will produce at least 16 MSc graduates,
equipped with bioinformatics and research skills to position them as future innovators and leaders in infectious
disease research. Customized workshops (based on needs assessment with LMIC partners) will strengthen
research, supervisory and mentoring capacity. This will help empower LMIC faculty and create an enabling en-
vironment, to encourage trainees to return to their home institutions and develop and retain regional capacity. A
detailed monitoring and evaluation plan has been developed to assess the program. This integrated approach
will make the biggest impact on the current bioinformatics landscape in Southern Africa. It will bring together a
productive network of TB researchers, bioinformaticians, US mentors and LMIC partners to implement a TB-

10892545,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer survivors with cardiovascular disease risk factors (complex cancer survivors) are a growing population
and their morbidity and mortality risks are significant. Despite strong clinical evidence bases and established
guidelines to manage CVD risks, cancer survivors often forego necessary chronic condition care especially
during cancer treatment. A shared care model (when two or more clinicians of different specialties care for the
same patient) is the optimal care delivery model for complex cancer survivors and has been shown to produce
optimal comorbidity management when primary care is involved. Nevertheless, in the U.S. cancer survivorship
focuses on static approaches such as providing survivorship care plans and guidelines for primary care without
addressing the implementation context and care delivery processes. These approaches have proven insufficient
to shift care paradigms and produce shared care for complex cancer survivors. Many currently proposed and
tested cancer survivorship care strategies are considered oncology-centric and do not align with primary care
generalist orientations in managing patients with multiple chronic conditions or fit in real-world contexts of primary
care practices. Results from our ongoing and recent research studies indicate that survivors managing chronic
conditions should not be disconnected from their primary care team. Therefore, feasibility issues must be
addressed using stakeholder-informed strategies to enhance the translational potential of shared care that aligns
multiple stakeholders (i.e., cancer care team, patients, primary care teams) understandings of this paradigm of
care and build team-based care capacities. This study employs a designing for dissemination, theory guided
perspective, blending implementation science and care delivery conceptual frameworks Exploration, Planning,
Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) and Cancer Multi-team System (cMTS) to understand and address the
multi-level factors of implementing shared care in a health system. These perspectives will shape tailoring and
implementation of Primary Care Connect (PC2), a health system intervention designed to align complex cancer
survivors, healthcare team members, and health system implementation actors’ understandings, capacities, and
practices to promote the adoption of shared care delivery models for complex cancer survivors. Using a hybrid
type III effectiveness-implementation study design it aims to: (1) engage diverse primary care and health system
stakeholders to tailor PC2 to maximize implementation strategies fit to the health system and primary care
practice contexts; (2) conduct a randomized controlled trial (n=266 patients) to test the effectiveness of PC2 on
primary care connection, chronic disease management, and patient-reported outcomes; and, (3) evaluate PC2
implementation using a mixed methods approach to inform sustainable usage of the intervention. Study results
are poised to have a profound impact on the adoption of shared care delivery models throughout the U.S. to
optimally mitigate complex cancer survivors CVD risks."
10895303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Textbooks teach us that actin filaments give cells their shape, and that a “parts list” of proteins drives
actin remodeling when cells change shape. But what is missing from this simple telling is a holistic understanding
of how upstream gene expression and signaling control actin remodeling, how different proteins work together
to remodel actin, and how downstream cell shape change is converted into timely and reliable organismal out-
comes. Because actin-based failures can stem from events before, during and after remodeling, we need an
integrated understanding to make sense of actin’s critical role in health and disease.
 To obtain this kind of “whole picture” view of actin, my lab studies cellularization, the first tissue-building
event in Drosophila embryos. We developed this simple experimental system so that we can study the actin
remodeling that drives cellularization, while also relating that remodeling to upstream events at the level of gene
expression and signaling, and downstream outcomes including morphogenetic fidelity and embryonic viability.
Our methods combine Drosophila genetics and embryology with quantitative live-cell imaging of mRNAs, actin,
and actin regulatory proteins, down to single-molecule resolution.
 Our long-term objective is to understand how the actin cytoskeleton interacts with subcellular processes
(e.g. transcription) and systems (e.g. nucleus) to orchestrate cell shape change with “the right” kinetics, robust-
ness and mechanical properties to achieve successful organismal outcomes. In the next five years, we will focus
on three goals arising from our ongoing studies: Goal 1. Determine how gene expression regulates actin remod-
eling – Gene expression instructs morphogenesis. Yet, we do not know how transcriptional dynamics inform
actin remodeling. For cellularization, five genes that encode actin regulators must be transcribed. We will test a
hypothesis that quantitative features of transcription of these genes underpin the global synchrony and uniformity
of cellularization in embryos. Goal 2. Determine mechanisms of actomyosin contraction – Actomyosin contraction
is essential to cell shape change, but its mechanism is controversial. During cellularization, actomyosin rings
contract in back-to-back phases that are mechanistically distinct (Myosin-2 dependent versus independent). We
will determine how actin binding proteins drive each mechanism. Goal 3. Determine how the actin cytoskeleton
responds to environmental stress – Actin is increasingly recognized as a mediator of stress response. We re-
cently identified a heat inducible Actin Stress Response (ASR) in embryos. We will test the hypothesis that ASR
puts embryo viability at risk by altering homeostasis between free actin pools in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
 These goals build on each other so that we will understand how mechanisms before, during and after
actin remodeling work together to determine outcomes for the embryo. Our efforts are facilitated by my lab’s
proven ability to quantify phenotypes and relate events across scales and subcellular systems. The proteins and
processes we study are conserved across organisms so our findings will be broadly relevant."
10895314,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autoimmunity is increasingly recognized as a novel pathogenic mechanism for cardiac arrhythmias. Several
arrhythmogenic autoantibodies have been identified, cross-reacting with different types of surface proteins
critically involved in cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, primarily ion channels (autoimmune cardiac
channelopathies). Specifically, some of these autoantibodies can prolong the action potential duration,
leading to acquired long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition known to increase the risk of life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. The most
investigated form of autoimmune LQTS is associated with the presence of circulating anti-Ro/SSA antibodies
(anti-Ro Abs), frequently found in patients with autoimmune diseases, but also in a significant proportion of
apparently healthy subjects in the general population. Accumulating evidence indicates that anti-Ro Abs can
markedly delay ventricular repolarization via a direct inhibitory cross-reaction with the extracellular pore region
of the human ether-à-go-go related gene K+ channel (hERG-K+), resulting in a higher propensity for anti-Ro
Abs-positive subjects to develop LQTS and ventricular arrhythmias/TdP. Recent population data demonstrate
that the risk of LQTS in subjects with circulating anti-Ro Abs is significantly increased, independent of a history
of overt autoimmune diseases. Here, we hypothesize that decoy peptides, designed to mimic the cross-
reactive B-cell epitope present on both Ro/SSA antigen and hERG-K+ channel S5-S6 pore region, can
neutralize anti-Ro Abs and thus normalize or prevent QTc prolongation. Such decoy peptides are therefore
innovative therapeutic tools for anti-Ro Abs induced LQTS, associated TdP and sudden cardiac death. In this
project, we aim to develop these tools and test the molecular, decoy peptides hypothesis with 3 aims: 1)
Validate the cross-reactive epitope hypothesis and optimize the decoy molecule into a valid biologic drug
candidate; 2) Normalize QTc prolongation by the administration of decoy peptides to an in vivo animal model of
autoimmune associated LQTS and 3) investigate the electrophysiological mechanisms by which the decoy
peptides normalize QTc prolongation on the surface ECG at the cardiomyicyte level.
Collectively, the new decoy peptides developed in this application may illuminate how anti-Ro Abs contribute to
the public health burden imposed by cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, this research could achieve new
understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of anti-Ro Abs and open a new therapeutic direction for
mitigating this burden, including the possibility of advancing our decoy peptide therapy towards a licensed
drug. Finally, a new concealed risk factor contributing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden
cardiac death events in the general population may be revealed and treated."

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with an even greater burden of major disability. It
occurs at all ages with the greatest incidence in the elderly. The number of strokes is expected to rise in the US
and worldwide as the population ages. In 2013, NINDS established NIH StrokeNet to harness the leadership
and experience of the stroke research field to efficiently create and complete high-quality, multi-site trials and
related biomarker validation and ancillary studies spanning prevention, treatment, and recovery. Since
inception, the National Clinical Coordinating Center (NCC) at the University of Cincinnati has provided overall
leadership and has coordinated activities within NIH StrokeNet. Our central objective is to engage the broader
stroke community to successfully and efficiently design trials that are scientifically important, innovative, and
feasible; to start trials expeditiously after being funded by NINDS; to successfully recruit and retain
representative participants of the US population, and to maintain a pipeline of new clinical trialists by guiding
the training, education, and career development of StrokeNet’s fellows and clinical research professionals. In
addition to providing overall leadership and coordination for 24-27 regional coordinating centers affiliated with
500+ potential study sites, the NCC includes the StrokeNet research pharmacy and imaging activities.
Our NCC team consists of two MPIs with over 50 years of collective experience designing, implementing, and
completing multi-site clinical trials; over 30 NCC staff with in-depth expertise in coordinating, contracting,
regulatory, pharmacy and imaging activities; a high level of support from University of Cincinnati; over 20 NCC
co-investigators across the US with established expertise in the broad range of cerebrovascular disease and
trial methodologies; and numerous international collaborators."
10893338,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Senescent astrocytes and microglia, which accumulate with age and in patients with AD, contribute to
neurodegeneration. A major gap in our knowledge is understanding the mechanisms that lead to astrocyte
senescence. Our long-term goal is to define the molecular targets and therapeutic interventions that slow aging
by inhibiting senescence and to determine their impact on neurodegenerative diseases. The overall objective in
this application is to: 1) define the mechanisms by which the glycolytic by-product methylglyoxal (MGO) drives
astrocyte senescence and 2) enhance the detoxification of MGO to mitigate astrocyte senescence and
neurodegeneration in models of AD. Our central hypothesis is that MGO induces senescence in astrocytes,
which secrete pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors that cause the
neurodegeneration associated with dementia and AD. The rationale of our hypothesis is based partly on the
fact that astrocytes are known to be the metabolic workhorses of the brain and undertake glycolysis to provide
neurons with lactate. Consequently, astrocytes produce more MGO and show increased activity of the MGO
detoxifying pathways. We observe that MGO, which enhances macromolecular damage, causes senescence.
Thus, strategies to detoxify MGO can provide novel approaches to lowering the risk of AD and related
neurodegeneration in the elderly. We will test the hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1).
Determine the mechanisms by which MGO drives senescence in human iPSC derived astrocytes; 2) Determine
the mechanisms by which senescent astrocytes cause neuronal damage; and 3) Determine the role of the Trpa1
pathway in modulating MGO-induced senescence and AD pathology in mouse models. We will use iPSC
derived astrocytes to determine the mechanisms by which MGO mediates senescence. Furthermore, we will
use proteomics to define the SASP of MGO-induced senescent astrocytes and determine the effect of the SASP
on iPSC-derived neurons carrying wild type and mutant alleles of tau using co-cultures. We will genetically and
pharmacologically manipulate Trpa1 to detoxify MGO to test its effects on senescence and associated
neurodegeneration in two mouse models of AD. We will combine the treatments to detoxify MGO and eliminate
senescent cells to determine if they are working through the same pathways to inhibit neurodegeneration. The
proposed research is innovative because it will determine a novel function for MGO, an endogenous metabolite
produced during glycolysis, in driving astrocytic senescence and, thus, neurodegeneration. A
key significance of this work will help us understand the link between metabolism, inflammation, and
neurodegeneration. It will also pave the way to developing novel therapies for treating Alzheimer’s and related
dementias based on reducing the presence or activity of senescent cells and by lowering MGO."
10893393,"Project Summary
In my laboratory, we study how host metabolism determines the outcome of infectious diseases, such as during
pneumonia. Pneumonia is a brisk inflammatory reaction to airway pathogens that, if not adequately regulated,
can predispose to infection by opportunists that exploit airway oxidation to persist, such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which belong to the feared family of multidrug-resistant ESKAPE
pathogens. In response to the oxidative metabolism of airway cells, these organisms activate many mechanisms
of virulence that favor their survival in the human lung, such as toxins and biofilms, which exacerbate the damage
of the respiratory mucosa. Although it is known how these opportunists exploit airway damage to persist, it
remains poorly understood how the host eradicates infections by controlling these pro-oxidant pathways. In the
5 years contemplated for this project, we will address how regulation of oxidative metabolism in airway cells
limits bacterial persistence, and how we can use this knowledge to design new therapies to eradicate pulmonary
infections by ESKAPE pathogens. Nucleotides, like purines and pyrimidines, are not only used by cells to
generate nucleic acids to grow, but also to supervise many physiological processes, such as inflammation.
Indeed, in many autoimmune diseases, anti-inflammatory nucleotide signaling is severely impaired, causing
tissue oxidation and mucosal damage. These strong anti-inflammatory properties of certain nucleotidic routes
are also exploited by tumors to evade host immunity. In order to suppress the activation of anti-tumor leukocytes,
malignant cells co-opt both dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and the ecto-nucleotidase CD73, which
are two major components of the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis and the purine dephosphorylation
route, respectively. While the regulatory roles of DHODH and CD73 are well appreciated in cancer and
autoimmune diseases, their activities in other major inflammatory pathologies, like pneumonia, remains unclear.
Here, we will progress in the research line of my laboratory by establishing that nucleotide metabolism through
both DHODH and CD73 is critical in the protection of the host lung against pneumonia by P. aeruginosa and S.
aureus. We will demonstrate that both DHODH and CD73 limit the detrimental oxidative metabolism of airway
cells, thus preventing from activation of mechanisms of pathogenesis by ESKAPE opportunists that feed off lung
damage to cause disease, like toxin synthesis and biofilms. We will accomplish these goals by performing
transcriptomic and metabolomics analyses in the airway of infected both controls and DHODH/CD73-deficient
animals, in which we will measure the host and bacterial networks related with oxidative metabolism, host
immunity, and pathogen virulence. Thus, in this project, we will establish the impact of nucleotide metabolism in
lung health against pulmonary pathogens, which will provide us both a metabolic framework to better understand
the pathology of pneumonia and new targets to clear infection produced by these opportunists."
10893394,"Acute and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) are often interrelated, and each can predispose to the other. Both
are common and costly yet biomarkers and treatments are incomplete. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project
(KPMP) addresses this problem via acquisition of research protocol kidney biopsies for pathologic and
biomolecular interrogation. This application responds to RFA-DK-20-026, proposing addition of the
Universities of North Carolina (UNC) and Arizona (UA) as highly resourced recruitment sites enriched
with rural, Black, LatinX and indigenous populations and with renowned centers in health equity and
environmental health research. Inclusion of geographically diverse populations is critical to KPMP, as
socioeconomic determinants of health represented by neighborhood context and environmental pollutants
explain much of the geographic variability of CKD prevalence.
▪ AIM 1: To adhere to the highest safety and ethical standards, while successfully recruiting and
 retaining KPMP participants from geographically, racially, and ethnically diverse populations with
 AKI and/or CKDs. We have included experts in bioethics and health equity to inform and guide our
 approaches and overcome barriers to recruitment and retention. To provide the highest safety for our KPMP
 participants, we have partnered with interventional radiology to perform all research kidney biopsies.
▪ AIM 2: To fully engage and collaborate with investigators of the KPMP to maximize its efficiency,
 productivity, and discovery with the goal of reducing the human and economic toll of CKDs and AKI.
 We will adhere to existing protocols of KPMP, actively participate in committees and writing groups, and
 provide creative strategies to troubleshoot barriers and optimize workflow within KPMP.
▪ AIM 3: To enhance the breadth of KPMP scientific productivity through inclusion of fully diverse
 populations and acquisition of detailed environmental exposure data that are currently not captured.
 There is geographic heterogeneity in the prevalence and severity of CKDs. Using new tools, our site will
 provide new information about environmental exposures for CKDs and AKI that will broaden the
 interpretation of KPMP findings.
In summary, our application proposes to further strengthen KPMP through demographic and geographic
diversification using tools to assess neighborhood context and identify environmental exposures to expand
research opportunities in these fields critical to the pathogenesis of AKI and CKDs."
10893395,"ABSTRACT
Ants exhibit highly evolved eusocial behaviors including stark division of labor among female castes, where the
queen carries out all reproduction and worker castes forage for food and defend the colony. Interestingly, and
of great relevance to aging research, sterile workers are shorter-lived, with variable lifespans between distinct
castes. Reproductive queens are long-lived, with lifespans differing three to ten-fold between queen and
worker. Remarkably, the genomes of the sterile and reproductive castes are nearly identical, and thus
differences in lifespan and behavior arise from non-genetic mechanisms. We investigate two species of ants,
each with advantages for study of mechanisms linking aging with complex social behavior. In Harpegnathos
saltator, loss or removal of the queen leads to altered behavior in the workers, with antennal dueling and
eventual ascendance of workers to reproductive status. From a longevity perspective, the induced reproductive
caste exhibits four-fold longer lifespan, thus providing a simple experimental switch to uncover important
causality underlying aging. In Camponotus floridanus, there are two distinct worker castes, forager and
soldier, with the soldier exhibiting a two-fold longer lifespan than the forager. These behaviors are programmed
early in life, but exhibit plasticity during aging. Intriguingly, these castes can be experimentally reprogrammed
from soldier-to-forager, thus providing a second paradigm to study the relationship of behavior to aging. Our
overall premise is that genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic regulation—all hallmark foundational causes of
aging—are at the heart of caste-differentiated lifespan disparities and relationship to caste behavior.
 We thus propose to utilize ants to investigate the epigenetic and physiological basis of the dramatic
lifespan differences between reproductive and distinct worker castes. In H. saltator we have evidence in the
long-lived reproductive caste for two mechanisms extending lifepan. First, we detect increased expression of a
unique HSF (Heat Shock Factor) providing proteomic protection and longer lifespan via upregulation of the
Heat Shock Response transcriptional pathway. Second, we find increased expression of a unique Ago2
(Arogonaut) that binds miRNAs that specifically target for destruction certain mRNAs that lower lifespan in
short-lived workers. In C. floridanus we find that distinct chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms are central to
foraging, which is an age-linked behavior, and we can manipulate these pathways to reprogram soldier caste
to forage. In the proposed research we will investigate these causal mechanisms, and then manipulate lifespan
with a combination of genetic and epigenetic approaches to promote these mechanisms. The ant model
system provides an exceptional opportunity to integrate social behavior with aging, and to uncover key
epigenetic processes underlying universal aging pathways. Results from the research will provide fundamental
knowledge about control of lifespan that can be translated to more sophisticated mammals."
10893542,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 37 million Americans, costs tens of billions of dollars annually, and can
lead to kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and early mortality. CKD is not a single entity but rather a
heterogeneous condition with a wide spectrum of underlying causes, pathologic and clinical manifestations, and
varying rates of loss of kidney function. Because of the paucity of kidney biopsy samples from patients with
common forms of CKD and the acknowledged limitations of animal models, our understanding of the pathology
and molecular mechanisms of CKD is limited. Improved understanding of human CKD due to hypertension and
diabetes will require investigation of kidney tissue from patients with CKD, using rapidly evolving techniques in
molecular pathology. We are responding to RFA-DK-20-026 to continue as a multicenter CKD recruitment site
for the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) that builds upon the accomplishments of our established
multidisciplinary research group in the UG3/UH3 phase. We propose to continue to participate as a successful
CKD recruitment site in Boston, MA including four clinical sites: Joslin Diabetes Center, Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The proposal builds upon an
established infrastructure and our experience recruiting and retaining KPMP participants. In addition, our site
has an outstanding safety record for participants with no major post-biopsy complications as well as exceeding
the quality biospecimen metrics. For the U01 phase we propose to obtain repeat kidney biopsies in selected
individuals as well as increase the focus on social determinants of health. We also will continue to biopsy
individuals with longstanding Type 1 diabetes mellitus with no evidence of kidney pathology (‘resistors') to identify
molecular underpinnings of protection against diabetic kidney disease. We are committed to continued
collaborative protocol development, sharing best practices, and team science to achieve the KPMP’s objectives
of advancing precision medicine to improve the lives of our patients with and at risk for CKD. The proposed
research plan, by improving our understanding of CKD pathophysiology, has the potential to dramatically impact
public health."

Improving the ability of clinicians to foresee the practical impact of discoveries in basic and clinical research, and
the ability of basic scientists to understand critical gaps in patient care, is key to creating new interventions that
will reduce the frequency and severity of blindness. This K12 application will continue a highly successful
mentored vision clinician-science training program at OHSU. Our first two trainees, Drs. J. Peter Campbell and
Travis Redd, have both realized their K12 goals. Establishing a national and international reputation in applying
artificial intelligence (AI) and telemedicine to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), Dr. Campbell is now PI on an
R01 to continue this work and is co-PI on a second R01 to develop a handheld ultrawide-field optical coherence
tomography angiography device to improve early diagnosis of ROP. Dr. Redd has developed international ties
to create a database of corneal and microbiologic images of corneal ulcers. He is using this to train AI systems
to develop an automated image-based system that can differentiate bacterial from fungal infection better than
human experts. He has been awarded a K23 to continue this work. Dr. Aiyin Chen, who is one year into her K12
training program, is a glaucoma specialist transitioning to a clinician-scientist career. She is using informatics and
deep-learning to analyze electronic health records to identify systemic risk factors for glaucoma and is submitting
a K23 application to continue this work and her training. The university has top programs in clinical ophthalmology
and basic visual science. The ophthalmology department has nearly $21 million in direct vision research funding
(all sources) in 2022. This is a 122% increase compared to 2017. This K12 program will continue to support one
trainee at a time, chosen by an Advisory Committee that represents multiple areas of research focus (basic
research, imaging, genetics, reading center, clinical trials, informatics), eye institute leadership, and chairs of
departmental diversity and faculty development committees. The program will emphasize: (1) individualized
research with mentor teams to guide and monitor progress; (2) didactic courses on fundamentals of basic,
clinical, and translational vision science and access to courses in the trainee’s chosen field; (3) OHSU and
department-sponsored research seminars and highly effective manuscript and grant writing workshops; and (4)
Training in the responsible conduct of research and methods for enhancing reproducibility. This program will
provide broad exposure to basic sciences and clinical research for trainees with an existing background in clinical
ophthalmology and support them to complete a formal curriculum and hands-on research experience needed to
lead independent research. This will result in clinician-scientists who are better prepared to translate scientific
and technological advances into real progress that improves the lives of patients with vision-threatening
disorders."

The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted older socioeconomically
disadvantaged African-Americans. This research will test whether a recently developed community-based
intervention program known as Generation Exchange (GenX) can enhance a key biological mediator of
antiviral resistance (Type I interferon response) in this disadvantaged population. Our previous research
has identified a stress-triggered genomic program known as the “Conserved Transcriptional Response to
Adversity” (CTRA). The CTRA is activated by fight-or-flight stress responses and causes immune cells to
reduce antiviral activity and stimulate inflammation, both of which are detrimental in the context of COVID-
19. Our previous research on biological resilience in the face of adversity has also found that the CTRA is
reduced in people with high levels of eudaimonic well-being, which includes purpose in life, generativity,
and pro-social engagement. In the present study, we will conduct a randomized controlled intervention
trial (n=160) to test whether a eudaimonia-promoting intergenerational mentoring program known as
Generation Xchange (GenX) can enhance Type I interferon responses and reduce hyper-inflammatory
responses in older African-American women and men living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged urban
community. Our hypotheses are that GenX will, 1) increase Type I interferon antiviral responses, 2)
reduce hyper-inflammatory bias, and 3) reduce rates of clinical respiratory virus infection and symptomatic
disease (COVID, influenzas, and colds). To identify the biological mechanisms of antiviral resistance in
this specific population, we will also analyze specific antiviral cell types (e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
monocytes) and gene regulatory processes (e.g., transcription factor activity and single-cell gene
expression). These measures will be used to determine 4) which biological factors are most important in
protecting older African-Americans from respiratory virus infection, 5) how those biological risk factors are
linked to other established respiratory virus risk factors (e.g., overweight/obesity, pre-existing chronic
disease, low physical activity, poor sleep, social isolation/loneliness), and 6) which biological factors are
impacted by GenX. Finally, we test the hypothesis that 7) GenX will show positive effects for both women
and men, for those with low or high education level, and for those with low or high levels of background
risk factors (e.g., overweight/obesity, chronic disease, low physical activity, social isolation/loneliness).
Our overarching goal is to establish a community-based biobehavioral intervention program that is broadly
scalable, involves defined biological mechanisms of antiviral resistance, and leverages social support and
eudaimonic well-being to mitigate the detrimental effects of age and social disadvantage on host
resistance to respiratory virus infection among COVID-vulnerable older African-Americans."
10867355,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women with endometriosis develop ectopic growth of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity and as a
result, experience debilitating chronic pelvic pain, high rates of infertility, and damaging effects to their physical,
mental, and social well-being. The endometrium holds a unique regenerative power allowing it to grow,
differentiate, and break down hundreds of times over the course of a woman’s lifetime. This potential is
conferred by stem cells residing in the deep basalis endometrium, as well as in other areas of the endometrial
epithelium and stroma. In the transforming growth factor  (TGF) pathway, ligands such as TGF and the
bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are antagonistic and play opposing roles in cell differentiation. Our
published mouse models show that endometrial TGF and BMP signaling are critical throughout pregnancy
and for post-partum endometrial regeneration. Using endometrial organoid cultures, we identified that loss of
TGF signaling resulted in activation of two key stem-cell related signaling pathways, the BMP and retinoic
acid signaling pathways. Ectopic lesions in women with endometriosis overexpress the bone morphogenetic
protein receptor (BMPR2) and the ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 enzymes, which catalyze retinoic acid synthesis
and are stem cell markers in many tissue types. BMPs drive the expansion of ALDHHI-expressing cancer stem
cells in the ovary. Despite the critical roles of BMPs and ALDH on stem cell function in other organs,
their roles in normal endometrial regeneration and endometriosis remain unknown. In this R01, we will
examine the hypothesis that BMP signaling affects endometrial stemness by controlling the proliferation and
differentiation of ALDH1A1+ and ALDH1A3+ stem cells. The Specific Aims are, 1) Define how retinoid
biosynthesis controls endometrial stem cell regeneration and differentiation in the endometrium and 2)
Determine the efficacy of BMP receptor kinase inhibition in endometriosis using cells, organoids, and mouse
models of endometriosis. Our approach will define how ALDH1A1+ and ALDH1A3+ cells contribute to the
regenerative potential of the endometrium by generating and characterizing two new Aldh1a1creERT2-tdTomato
and Aldh1a3creERT2-tdTomato reporter mouse lines using in vivo lineage tracing studies and in vitro
morphological and genome wide transcriptomic studies in endometrial organoids. Data from mouse models will
be leveraged with studies performed in purified human endometrium with high ALDH activity. To advance
therapeutic options for women with endometriosis, we will define the role of the BMP type 2 receptor, BMPR2,
in endometriosis. We will also collaborate with the Center for Drug Discovery to test the efficacy of newly
developed BMPR2 kinase inhibitors on endometriosis cells, 3D organoids, and in a mouse model of
endometriosis. Thus, by defining the roles of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 as stem cell markers of the
endometrium and by advancing the therapeutic options for women with this disease, our studies will address
the strategic goals of the Gynecological Health and Disease Branch at the NICHD."
10864524,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application aims to use existing data within the All of Us Researcher Workbench to improve our ability to
identify cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients treated with statins or antiplatelet therapy (i.e. P2Y12 inhibitors)
at increased risk for adverse drug responses and adverse outcomes. In order to manage CVD and prevent
adverse outcomes, CVD patients can be treated with multiple medications including lipid-lowering agents or
statins and antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel. There are well known clinical and genetic factors that
impact the risk of statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS) with numerous statins and the risk of
adverse cardiovascular outcomes with the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel. Despite guidance from expert consensus
groups, and regulatory agencies, the implementation of pharmacogenetic testing for statins, and P2Y12
inhibitors has been limited, occurring mostly at large, academic medical centers. Additionally, almost all of the
studies conducted to date have been in populations of largely European and Asian ancestry. In order to
provide equitable care and fulfill precision medicine for the over 53 million Americans estimated to be treated
with statins or P2Y12 inhibitors annually, we need to better understand their usage and associated outcomes in
diverse, real-world populations. Our central hypothesis is that precision medicine models derived from diverse,
real-world data for SAMS, and adverse outcomes after treatment with an antiplatelet agent, will be more
precise and accurate than existing models To test our central hypothesis we will complete the following
Specific Aims: 1) Evaluate statin prescribing patterns, adverse drug responses, and adverse outcomes in
patients with CVD by SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes using electronic-health record (EHR)-based
data, genomic data, and data from surveys and wearables, and 2) Characterize antiplatelet prescribing
patterns, adverse drug responses, and adverse outcomes in patients with CVD by CYP2C19 genotype using
EHR-based data, genomic data, and data from surveys and wearables. To achieve these aims, we will utilize
existing data from the All of Us Researcher Workbench. The All of Us Research Program is enrolling a diverse
group of persons in the United States, and including multiple types of real-world data (e.g. EHR, demographic,
wearables, patient surveys, genomic). We will deploy validated CVD algorithms and determine observed rates
of CVD, statin prescribing, and antiplatelet prescribing. We will identify characteristics of SAMS in patients with
CVD treated with statins and characteristics of adverse outcomes in patients with CVD treated with a P2Y12
inhibitor. We will also use multivariable regression analyses and machine-learning methods to model adverse
drug responses and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We will examine characteristics and models of CVD
patients treated with statins by SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 genotypes, and of CVD patients treated with
a P2Y12 inhibitor by CYP2C19 genotypes. Analyses will be conducted overall, by race and ethnicity, urban
versus rural areas, across geographic regions, and by sex as a biological variable."
10868477,"Over 70 million individuals worldwide suffer from vitiligo, a psychologically devastating autoimmune disease of
the skin that causes disfiguring white spots and disproportionately affects those with darker skin. This, com-
bined with a lack of FDA-approved treatments for vitiligo, creates a concerning health disparity for some of the
most vulnerable of our population. Because of the accessibility of the skin, vitiligo provides a unique oppor-
tunity for detailed, innovative translational research studies that provide insight into its pathogenesis and lead
to improved treatment strategies. Further, vitiligo shares genetic risk alleles and other mechanisms with auto-
immune diseases that are more complex and/or difficult to study using translational tools and thus provides an
unparalleled model through which to understand mechanisms of human autoimmunity.
We have generated preliminary data using a translational multi-omics approach that reveal thousands of new
data points marking hundreds of new signaling pathways that coordinate autoimmunity in the skin during viti-
ligo. What remains lacking, however, is an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to assemble this new data
into a comprehensive understanding of disease pathogenesis within vitiligo skin lesions. Thus, there is a critical
need to establish a coordinated, collaborative effort to reveal new, high-resolution insight into the pathogenesis
of vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases that could support innovative, advanced treatment strategies.
We will leverage our existing data, leading multidisciplinary investigative team, and cutting-edge research tools
to accomplish this task within the Vitiligo Center of Research Translation (VCORT). Strong communication,
coordination, fiscal management, education, and dissemination of information will be critical to the success of
this multidisciplinary effort. The overall objective of the Administrative Core is to serve as an interface among
VCORT participants to promote the generation and dissemination of knowledge among the collaborative inves-
tigators, the broader scientific community, and the public. We will do this through the following specific
aims: 1) Manage internal and external communication; 2) Advance scientific endeavors and ensure achieve-
ment of specific milestones; 3) Effectively manage financial resources and ensure compliance. Thus, the Core
will remove administrative and financial duties from the workload of VCORT scientists, allowing them to focus
on research.
The expected outcome is to have established and maintained a VCORT through which exceptional transla-
tional science is conducted in a diverse, informed, and highly collaborative environment. This will have an im-
portant positive impact on patients, caregivers, and the research community through progress toward under-
standing and treating vitiligo, as well as establishing strong collaborations to expand the field of translational
research in vitiligo and human autoimmunity."
10868478,"Much has been learned about mechanisms that drive autoimmunity by studying vitiligo, a dis-
ease of the skin that results from destruction of pigment-producing melanocytes. This results in
disfiguring white spots that are particularly devastating for those with darker skin, which thus
leads to health disparities for the most vulnerable of our population. We generated an extensive
set of preliminary data using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) that revealed hun-
dreds of conversations that are unique to vitiligo lesions involving every cell type of the epider-
mis. These data indicate that cells and their signaling networks within affected and unaffected
vitiligo skin are in fact more complex than previously appreciated. Yet because scRNA-Seq re-
quires disruption of the tissue, the position of each cell and their communications within the skin
remains unknown.
We hypothesize that cells connected in silico by matching induced ligand-receptor expression
are in close physical proximity in situ, and that T cell clones marked by identical T cell receptor
(TCR) sequences associate in physical contact with melanocytes. The objective of the High-
Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics Research Core using sequential fluorescence in situ hybridi-
zation (seqFISH+) is to use our highly innovative platform to provide spatial context to T cell
clonality, cellular positioning, and cell-cell communications revealed by the complementary, syn-
ergistic Center Projects 1+2. Our seqFISH+ platform provides a cutting-edge, innovative ap-
proach to map RNA expression in tissues with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution,
allowing for identification of cell classes, expressed genes, and spatial organization in tissues.
This approach will be applied in the following specific aims: 1) Identify the position and distribu-
tion of T cell clones marked by unique TCR sequences within tissue; and 2) Reveal the spatial
organization of communicating cells by receptor-ligand mapping directly within vitiligo lesions.
We will use punch biopsies taken from the same vitiligo lesions that have been analyzed by sin-
gle cell techniques in each Project. We will design seqFISH+ probes that complement TCR se-
quences and ligand-receptor pairs for hybridization, which will indicate the spatial distribution of
T cell clonality and cell-cell communications through ligand-receptor pairing. This Research core
combines a highly innovative conceptual approach with cutting-edge technology. The prelimi-
nary data, investigative team, and innovative plan provides a robust and unique opportunity for
discovery of the fundamental mechanisms by which immune cells target self-tissues, which may
lead to improved treatment strategies."
10868481,"T cells are effector cells of autoimmunity that migrate to find their targets, produce cytokines that recruit and
activate other immune cells, and destroy their target cells in affected tissue. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease
of the skin in which cytotoxic CD8+ T cells target pigment-making melanocytes, which results in disfiguring
white spots that are particularly devastating for those with darker skin and thus leads to health disparities for
the most vulnerable of our population. Vitiligo is an ideal disease in which to investigate mechanisms of organ-
specific autoimmunity because disease phenotype can be directly correlated to molecular pathways. That is,
affected skin can be observed and sampled, target cells and antigens are known, and translational research
tools are available. Vitiligo shares genetic risk alleles and other mechanisms with autoimmune diseases like
type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis that are more difficult to study in human patients. Through vitiligo we can
develop a comprehensive understanding of organ-specific autoimmunity as it progresses within human tissue.
In vitiligo and models of other human autoimmune diseases, autoreactive T cell responses are commonly char-
acterized as homogenous, with an “all or nothing” result. This is partly due to the fact that mouse models of
autoimmunity are frequently based on a single high-affinity CD8+ cytotoxic clone transferred and activated arti-
ficially. However, we found that T cells infiltrating vitiligo skin lesions are polyclonal and heterogeneous, with
different antigenic specificities and activation states. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells organize into clustered units within
the epidermis that appear to attack melanocytes, while CD4+ and Treg cells are at the periphery of these clus-
ters. Together, these data indicate that T cell interactions in vitiligo are more complex than previously under-
stood. Our central hypothesis is that polyclonal CD8+, CD4+, and Treg cell communications coordinate mela-
nocyte destruction and determine vitiligo clinical phenotypes.
This project will determine how autoreactive T cell clonal diversity and localization define the clinical disease
phenotype, how T cell subtypes interact with each other to coordinate autoimmunity, and how T cells orches-
trate melanocyte destruction within the skin. First, we will determine the in vivo location, spatial relationships,
and functional characteristics of T cell clones in different clinical phenotypes of vitiligo, such as early incipient
vs. late established lesions, active vs. stable disease, and single vs. multiple locations. Next, we will character-
ize the function and reactivity of T cells isolated directly from the skin of these lesions. We will use primary T
cell and skin organ culture, T cell functional assays, T cell receptor affinity assays, the sequential fluorescence
in situ hybridization (seqFISH+) Core, and advanced computational methods. This project is translational in
approach because it will create new mechanistic understanding of how T cells mediate the initiation, progres-
sion, and maintenance of autoimmunity during vitiligo. Together these aims will define molecular mechanisms
utilized by autoreactive T cells and identify key functional pathways, supporting new therapeutic interventions."
10868483,"Project 2: Cell-cell communications
Cell-to-cell communication via the secretion of molecules or direct cell contact allows cells to perceive and

related to development, tissue homeostasis, and immunity. Errors in signaling can result in a range of
diseases, including autoimmune disease, so improved understanding of cell-to-cell communications and how
they are perturbed in disease may allow for the development of improved treatments.
Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease of the skin in which T cells target pigment-making melanocytes, which
results in disfiguring white spots that are particularly devastating for those with darker skin. Vitiligo is an ideal
autoimmune disease in which to study intercellular signaling because it is common, and the skin is accessible
to observation and sampling using translational research methods. We explored signaling pathways in vitiligo
using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and found that vitiligo lesional skin cells reflect diverse
phenotypes. We used this data to generate comprehensive cellular maps, which revealed that hundreds of
signaling molecules and receptors are dysregulated in vitiligo lesional skin.
The overarching hypothesis that drives this project is that disease progression requires complex cellular
communications to coordinate autoimmunity, and that epigenetic memory established by these signals is
responsible for relapse. Our objective is to dissect and validate cellular communications that we have identified
from scRNA-Seq, determine their function to promote and maintain autoimmunity, and then reassemble them
into a comprehensive understanding of vitiligo pathogenesis and autoimmune memory within the skin. We will
first determine how dysregulated cellular communications affect melanocyte-T cell interactions by focusing on
three novel signaling pathways revealed in our preliminary data. Next, we will define memory formation in
keratinocytes through cell type-specific regions that undergo chromatin remodeling in lesions. Finally, we will
use in vitro chemokine stimulation of skin cells to determine how novel chemokines and non-classic chemokine
signaling affects cell function in vitiligo, as well as their long-term impact on epigenetic memory. We will
integrate this understanding with spatial information revealed by the seqFISH+ Research Core.
Upon completion of the proposed research, we expect to discover fundamental mechanisms by which immune
cells target self-tissues and promote long-term memory of autoimmunity directly within the tissue, which could
have implications not only for vitiligo but other devastating autoimmune diseases."

Ethanol is the most common teratogen and the leading cause of mental retardation. Fetal alcohol exposure
can cause numerous birth defects, most commonly effecting the nervous system. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
Disorder describes the full range of potential ethanol-induced birth defects and has been estimated to have a
prevalence of 10 in 1000 births. The timing and concentration of fetal alcohol exposure are important
determinants of FASD phenotypes. There also appears to be genetic susceptibility to FASD, yet we know little
about the nature of these susceptibility loci and the mechanisms by which they modify the teratogenicity of
ethanol. The zebrafish embryo is particularly useful to identify and characterize loci that may underlie the
neural defects associated with FASD. In Aim 1, we characterize the effect of ROS on ethanol teratogenesis. In
Aim 2, we determine how mTORC1 signaling, downstream of ROS, modulates ethanol teratogenesis. In Aim 3,
we characterize risk and resilience factors modulating ethanol teratogenicity. Because of the conservation of
gene function between zebrafish and humans, the results from our studies will provide key insights into the
genetic loci that interact with ethanol to cause FASD."

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and remains a major cause of disability with over 25 million
individuals worldwide living with its consequences. Manifest atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for 10% of all
strokes, predominantly due to thromboembolism from the left atrium (LA). Despite thorough diagnostic
evaluation, 20-30% of ischemic strokes are classified as cryptogenic or of unknown cause. Most cryptogenic
strokes have an embolic appearance, known as embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). A substantial
portion of patients with ESUS will eventually be diagnosed with AF. Recent findings support the notion that an
underlying disease of the LA (atrial cardiopathy), which may lead to AF, may also independently result in
thrombus formation and increase stroke risk in the absence of AF. LA appendage (LAA) stasis is linked to
atrial thrombus formation as part of Virchow’s triad. Our preliminary work on LA 4D flow MRI (4DMRI) provides
a novel noninvasive tool that assesses LAA stasis and could provide a new paradigm for stroke prevention.
Other biomarkers of atrial cardiopathy have already been associated with greater risk of development of AF
and stroke, including atrial size/morphology, ECG P wave morphology, atrial strain on echocardiography,
epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), troponin and N terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels. Yet, none are
currently used for clinical decision making. The overall goal of this research is to identify clinical and
mechanistic characteristics of 4DMRI-derived LAA stasis in order to identify optimal strategies to prevent
recurrent stroke in patients with ESUS. It is anticipated that this mechanistic assessment for risk of atrial
thrombus formation will also provide improved utility for stroke prevention in AF. We will prospectively study
patients with ESUS at 4 experienced centers with heart-brain MRI, assessing LAA stasis by 4DMRI and other
atrial cardiopathy markers in a comprehensive manner. Specific aims are to : 1) Evaluate 4DMRI LA/LAA
stasis and other atrial cardiopathy biomarkers in patients with ESUS (Group 1, n=229), cardioembolic stroke
due to AF (Group 2, n=80), no stroke or AF (Group 3, n=80), and no stroke but with AF (Group 4, n=80). We
will assess the diagnostic utility of LA/LAA stasis and other atrial cardiopathy biomarkers for cardioembolic
stroke due to AF; 2) Assess the clinical factors predicting progression of LA/LAA stasis in 229 ESUS patients
by repeating MRI at 2 years; 3) Determine whether LAA stasis and/or other atrial cardiopathy biomarkers are
predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke (primary endpoint) and new AF (secondary) in 229 patients with ESUS.
We hypothesize that LAA stasis will be the strongest independent predictor of recurrent ischemic stroke. This
proposal, Cardiac ImagiNg of Embolic Mechanisms in Atriopathies causing Stroke (CINEMAS), focuses on
optimizing the diagnosis of atrial cardiopathy in patients with ESUS. Improved diagnosis with a strong link to
clinical endpoints can broaden the options for primary and secondary prevention of stroke and AF."

The Rocky Mountain Summer Research Education Experience (RMSREE) Program will fill a
critical need to increase the STEM knowledge and understanding of Denver area high school
teachers, enhancing the STEM content in the K-12 educational agencies in which they teach
and ultimately resulting in increased participation and better training of the biomedical sciences
research workforce.
The main goals of the RMSREE program are: 1) to provide substantive research training,
individualized academic preparation, and career guidance to strongly enhance the skills of the
RMSREE teacher participants, Research Education Fellows; 2) to recruit a diverse set of
Fellows who are committed to translating their research experience into enhanced STEM
education in their classrooms and provide them with professional development opportunities to
effectively bridge the gap between the research setting and the HS STEM classroom; and 3) to
continue to create and sustain long-term connections between CU Denver and local high
schools that will improve the STEM education of HS teachers as well as provide a STEM
pipeline for their students to enter into the biomedical imaging, bioengineering, and health
informatics professions. The RMSREE program holds high expectations for performance (95%
of participants adding significant STEM content by the end of their first year and 80%
maintaining that level over the five-year period following the program). To achieve these
ambitious outcomes we will recruit cohorts of highly-committed, ambitious candidates and
engage them in an integrated set of activities, centered around meaningful research
experiences, but also augmented with mentoring through individualized feedback on
professional development plans (PDPs), a weekly seminar series, and training in laboratory
culture and the responsible conduct of research. This will build participants' research skills and
STEM content knowledge and understanding as well as promote their progression to become
more effective STEM teachers. Group activities will contribute to building a cadre of trainees
who will continue to support each other throughout their careers to optimize professional
success. The RMSREE program will serve six Fellows each year, for a total of thirty trainees
over the 5-year project period, which will in turn impact many hundreds of their students in the
years following the project."
10877029,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence is known to disturb typical neurodevelopmental patterns,
increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD), and accelerate involutional processes in adulthood.
In response to RFA-AA-21-007, this application proposes a Research Project Site of the National Consortium
on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence - Adulthood (NCANDA-A) to follow for the next 5 years a
diverse community sample of male and female participants recruited in three age bands (12-14, 15-17, 18-21
years old) when most were no-to-low drinkers and tracked over the last 8 years across 5 sites (N=831; 93%
retention rate). Monitoring has involved annually acquired multimodal neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, resting state
fMRI, task fMRI), cognitive, clinical, behavioral, and biological data, collected in person or remotely by computer
and our mobile app. These measures will now be complemented with new advanced neuroimaging and sleep
and physical activity tracking. This cohort sequential design uniquely positions NCANDA-A to quantify transient
or enduring alcohol-related disturbances in specific adolescent and early adult neural system growth trajectories
and functional concomitants.
NCANDA-A proposes four consortium-wide specific aims and two specialty project aims. In Aim 1, NCANDA-A
will investigate the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on
subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol’s effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors (e.g., age
of drinking onset) that forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will quantify the
impact of the COVID pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and their relations
with alcohol use patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among patterns of
alcohol use, sleep, and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine the extent to
which short-term (i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect,
sleep and resting heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects of frequent binge
alcohol use. For each aim, sex differences in development, alcohol use patterns and history, impact of alcohol
use on the brain, and sex-differentiating psychosocial factors will be tested.
With the longitudinal data collected into early adulthood during this renewal, NCANDA-A will provide novel
information to the public on the enduring and transient effects of adolescent drinking on adult functioning by
discovering elements and mechanisms linking these dynamic processes and identifying modifiable risk factors."
10877030,"The human fetus undergoes complex immune development throughout gestation, and the maternal immune
system interacts closely with that of her fetus in preparation for birth most notably in the form of transplacental
transport of antibodies. Little studied, however, is the functional impact of in utero acquired maternal
microchimeric (MMc) cells on fetal immune development. Fetal T cells begin to populate the lymph nodes and
peripheral blood at 10-12 weeks’ gestation, and maternal cells are found in the fetus as early as 13 weeks’
gestation, suggesting that fetal and maternal cells access key immunologic spaces concurrently. We have
previously identified MMc in many cell subsets from cord blood, including T cells and antigen presenting cells
(APCs). Based on these observations, we propose a novel paradigm in which the fetal immune system is
profoundly shaped by this maternal graft via (i) the acquisition of functional maternal T cells, and (ii) the education
of fetal T cells by maternal APCs. In a South African cohort, we found that maternal HIV was associated with
decreased birth MMc when antiretroviral therapy was initiated during pregnancy, whereas, when therapy was
initiated prior to the pregnancy, the level of birth MMc was similar to HIV unexposed infants. These data suggest
a link between the maternal immune system and the amount of MMc acquired by her fetus, where immune
reconstitution in the first half of pregnancy restored the maternal graft. Outside of these observations, the
relationship between the maternal T cell compartment and the size or diversity of MMc T cells is unknown. If
maternal T cell transfer is a rare event, MMc T cells may be derived from a limited set of founding clones leading
to a restricted MMc repertoire. Alternatively, if maternal cells traffic in an unrestricted fashion, they may reflect
the full diversity of the maternal T cell repertoire, akin to the broad specificity of maternal IgG acquired by the
fetus, with potential implications for postnatal susceptibility to infection. We will therefore test the hypothesis that
maternal T cells traffic in an unrestricted fashion and broadly reflect the diversity of the maternal repertoire early
in pregnancy. In addition, the impact of MMc APCs on fetal immune development is entirely unexplored. Fetal
APC have impaired production of inflammatory cytokines relative to mature adult APC, resulting in preferential
differentiation of fetal T cells into Th2 effector or regulatory T cells. In contrast, we hypothesize that MMc APC
interacting with fetal T cells via shared HLA will drive the differentiation of fetal T cells into protective Th1 effector
cells. To test these hypotheses, we will enroll a prospective cohort of US pregnant women living with and without
HIV followed from first trimester with high quality sampling. Utilizing our robust single cell pipeline we will isolate
rare maternal cells from fetal cord blood and characterize their relationship to the maternal T cell compartment
and their potential effect on fetal T cell responses. An improved understanding of the role of these maternal cells
in shaping fetal immunity would have significant implications for fetal and neonatal health, including timing of
maternal immunization and susceptibility to infection in both HIV exposed and unexposed offspring."

Of all solid tumors, endometrial cancer (EC) exhibits one of the worst racial disparities - the Black-White mor-
tality gap has increased from 79.5% in 1992-2001 to 97.8% in 2014-2018. Receipt of treatment in line with na-
tional recommendations is an important modifiable factor that influences EC outcomes and contributes to racial
disparities in survival. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends surgical staging as the first
step of guideline-concordant treatment and pathology factors captured from surgery inform adjuvant treatment
recommendations. Our prior work demonstrates that receipt of guideline-concordant EC treatment improves
survival among EC patients who are Black or White. Therefore, the lower guideline-concordant EC treatment
among Black women that we have observed is concerning and contributes to the marked disparities in disease
outcomes. We lack a comprehensive understanding of the determinants that underlie disparate guideline-con-
cordant EC treatment, preventing any meaningful progress in evidence-based intervention development. The
extant literature has exclusively focused on individual-level factors as predictors of guideline-concordant EC
treatment. This work has not led to effective intervention and ignores the multilevel influences that are known
to undergird race-based differences in health. In addition, within guideline-concordant paradigms, there can be
wide variation in intensity level of recommended treatments, with markedly different impact on quality of life.
The impact of race on intensity of treatment within guideline-concordant paradigms is currently unknown. Most
important, there are no qualitative data to understand how Black women or their providers make decisions re-
garding EC treatment. Absent these critical building blocks, we cannot move forward with evidence-based in-
terventions to improve guideline-concordant EC treatment receipt. We propose to identify determinants of
guideline-concordant EC treatment disparities by combining analysis of multilevel data from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare claims linked dataset (Aims 1-2) with in-depth interviews of
Black women with EC and EC providers (Aim 3). Aim 1: Identify multilevel factors that predict Black-White dis-
parities in guideline-concordant EC treatment. Aim 2: Quantify racial disparities and underlying predictors of
guideline-concordant EC treatment intensity and examine associations between guideline-concordant EC treat-
ment intensity and survival. Aim 3: Examine the multilevel dynamics that drive and constrain treatment choices
by and for Black women with EC using qualitative methods. By analyzing a high-quality, multilevel dataset with
Black and White EC patients, and capturing first-hand accounts of treatment experiences and preferences of
Black women and their providers, our team will assess the importance of race-specific barriers to guideline-
concordant EC treatment. Our study will identify the set of multilevel modifiable factors that can be targeted to
reduce disparities and improve care for all women."

CANDIDATE: Eric J. Brandt, MD, MHS is a health services researcher, preventive cardiologist, and lipidologist.
His personal story of loss from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and clinical experience motivates his research at
the intersection of CVD outcomes, nutrition policy, and health equity. His goal is to become an independent
clinician investigator and leading cardiovascular health services researcher who influences policy changes to
reduce health disparities in CVD among disadvantaged populations.
RESEARCH CONTEXT: Poor diet is the leading contributor to premature death from CVD in the U.S. Racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have lower-quality diets and a higher burden of CVD.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) seeks to equitably improve nutrition security and
disproportionately serves racial-ethnic minority individuals. SNAP decreases food insecurity, however, existing
data are unclear about SNAP participants’ diet quality, how SNAP participants handle competing nutrition and
medical needs, and if SNAP participation influences health outcomes and use of medical services. The
projects in this proposal seek to fill critical knowledge gaps at the intersection of social determinants of health
(SDOH), minority health disparities, medical care, and CVD outcomes.
SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) To define dietary patterns among SNAP participants with CVD or CVD risk factors and to
correlate these with CVD mortality; 2) To identify how SNAP participants with CVD navigate the intersection of
nutrition, medical care, and health outcomes; and 3) To assess how SNAP participation drives the use of
medical care and how CVD events impact food purchases.
RESEARCH PLAN: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Brandt will study dietary patterns and CVD mortality of
SNAP participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; collect qualitative data to assess
the interplay between food and health among diverse individuals with CVD; and use linked SNAP enrollment,
Medicaid claims, and grocery data to study SNAP participant interactions with medical care. All projects will
assess underlying SDOH that explain differential outcomes across race-ethnicity.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Brandt will build upon prior training with courses or workshops in SDOH,
policy, nutritional epidemiology, causal inference analytics, and qualitative and mixed methods. Through strong
mentorship, scientific meetings, early-career faculty workgroups, manuscript publication, and R01 workshops
he will transition to independence and emerge as a leading cardiovascular health services researcher.
ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Brandt has full support from his Department and Division. He will leverage the ideal
training environment at the University of Michigan, including strong, collaborative mentorship and access to a
vast range of courses, workshops, and professional development resources."
10874795,"This project seeks to identify and test mechanisms that establish the transcriptional regulatory potency of early
embryos. The relationships among DNA accessibility, nucleosome lability, transcription, histone variants and
DNA sequences interacting with nucleosomes and transcription factors in early embryos and differentiated cell
types will be identified with genomic methods. It is proposed that regulatory potential may be primed at some
transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs, inclusive of promoters and enhancers/silencers) by DNA sequences
promoting weak histone interactions. Such sequence-based priming may synergize with the embryonic
abundance of histone variants known to promote TRE accessibility. In particular, H2A.Z/H3.3 histone variant
nucleosomes associate with low occupancy TREs. Furthermore, H2A.Z mRNA expression is high in blastula
embryos and multipotent adult cell precursors of indirectly developing sea urchins and polychaetes but low in
differentiated cells, therefore supporting a general H2A.Z transcriptional multipotency role. PRO-seq
(Precision Run-On Sequencing, a method to detect actively transcribing TREs) followed by dREG
(Discriminative Regulatory Element Detection, a vector machine TRE prediction tool) will identify
transcriptionally active TREs in early embryos and differentiated adult cell types. OmniATAC experiments will
test if in early embryo and differentiated cell TREs have incipient DNA accessibility. Quantitative micrococcal
nuclease and sequencing (qMNase-seq) will test if TREs with incipient DNA accessibility in early embryos are
occupied by labile nucleosomes. H2A.Z and H3.3 CUT&RUN (Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using
Nuclease) will test the prevalence of these histone variants at labile nucleosomes. The new data sets will
synergize with existing ATAC-seq and PRO-seq characterizations during sea urchin embryogenesis and
differentiation. Comparison among genomic profiles will test if transcriptionally disengaged but accessible
TREs in early embryos associate with labile nucleosomes, H2A.Z, H3.3, A/T-GC sequence periodicities and/or
pioneeer transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Similar experiments in terminally differentiated cell types
with low H2A.Z expression will test if incipient accessibility is an inherent property of TREs entirely based on
A/T-GC sequence periodicities. Accessibility sequences setting incipient TRE accessibility during
embryogenesis will be experimentally tested by DNase-I-seq of zygotically microinjected TREs harboring
mutations that alter A/T-GC sequence periodicities or pioneer TFBSs. The project will be integrated with
parallel efforts to implement “research in the classroom” in existing genomic courses that will recruit, train and
motivate diverse undergraduate and graduate students at CUNY. The understanding of basic transcriptional
multipotency mechanisms in sea urchin embryos is relevant to understand the evolution of developmental
gene regulation and to advance future therapeutics of tissue repair and regeneration."
10876960,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are genetically diverse, characterized by both rare variants of large effect size
and common variants of small effect size. Identifying the molecular mechanisms resulting from these variants
presents a key challenge for the development of clinical interventions. Human pluripotent stem-cell derived
neurons (hPSC-Ns) allow studies against a human genetic background, and show altered morphology and
electrophysiology in ASD conditions. However, identifying mechanisms remains difficult with small numbers of
lines, especially for common genetic variants. To overcome this challenge, we will leverage multi-omic
characterization of hPSC-Ns perturbed with CRISPRi knockdown of both large effect size ASD risk genes and
genes related to neuronal morphology (Aim 1) and electrophysiology (Aim 2). We will complement these screens
with a characterization (Aim 3) of a larger, diverse cohort of 46 ASD lines and 46 matched controls which do not
harbor coding variants in the genes perturbed in the previous Aims. An integrative analysis of this data (Aim 4)
will generate interpretable genetic signatures related to each of these phenotypes and will show how these
signatures interact with ASD risk genes. This approach is made possible by new techniques for pooled stem cell
culture developed in Dr. Ralda Nehme’s lab, high content optical profiling methods developed by Dr. Samouil
Farhi’s team, and data integration tools developed by Dr. Ernest Fraenkel’s group. The overall project will provide
a basic neurobiological understanding of hPSC-Ns; provide valuable insight into how both common and rare
variants induce observed cell-intrinsic phenotypes; and define an analytic framework and genetic signatures
which can be used to understand mechanistic recruitment of new genetic risk loci and other psychiatric diseases."

 Project Summary
 The long-range goal of this grant is to determine the cellular and molecular events that lead to the
generation of specific cell types in the vertebrate retina. In this renewal we focus upon endocrine signaling
pathways, nuclear hormone receptors, and genetic elements that regulate differential expression of the cone
visual pigment genes on tandemly-replicated gene arrays. In humans a tandemly-replicated array on the X
chromosome consists of one long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) gene followed by 1-9 medium wavelength-
sensitive (MWS) genes, which have diverged spectrally from LWS. This recent replication has provided most
humans with trichromatic color vision, because LWS, MWS, and SWS1 opsin proteins are uniquely expressed
in separate cone populations. Heritable defects in the LWS/MWS array result in various forms of color
blindness, X-linked retinal degenerations, and Bornholm Eye Disease, a cone dysfunction associated with high
myopia. Insights into regulation of differential expression of LWS vs. MWS opsins could allow therapeutic
manipulation of gene expression to treat these disorders. In addition, future regenerative approaches to the
treatment of other retinal disorders that involve the loss of cones (age-related macular degeneration;
Stargardt's disease) would ideally include similar in vitro or in vivo manipulations to generate cone phenotypes
in ratios that support high-acuity color vision. A decades-old model for human LWS vs. MWS opsin regulation
states that a stochastic event favors an association of an upstream regulatory region with the LWS or most
proximal MWS opsin promoter or exon. However, topographic patterns of the LWS:MWS ratio suggest that a
nonrandom, trans-regulatory mechanism may be involved. Pursuit of regulatory mechanisms has been limited
because within mammals, only primate and bat genomes are known to harbor tandem opsin arrays. In
contrast, the genomes of teleost fish, including zebrafish, contain numerous tandem arrays of opsins, which
are the consequences of independent gene replication events and neofunctionalization. In the previous award
period, we demonstrated that in zebrafish, the endocrine signal thyroid hormone (TH) regulates differential
expression of the tandem duplicates, lws1 vs. lws2, an array that shares a common ancestral LWS gene with
the genes of the human LWS/MWS array. Our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that the TH receptor,
Thrb2 (already known to promote the LWS cone phenotype), may have been evolutionarily co-opted to also
regulate differential expression of lws1 vs. lws2, such that unliganded Thrb2 promotes lws2 and suppresses
lws1, while liganded Thrb2 promotes lws1. We have identified two predicted, palindromic TH response
elements (ppTREs) on the lws locus, and preliminary studies suggest that each element has roles in regulating
endogenous patterns of lws1 vs. lws2, and in the response to TH. Additional preliminary data suggest that TH
can regulate expression of LWS vs. MWS opsin transcripts in human iPSC-derived 3D retinal organoids.
Together these findings represent tremendous breakthroughs in revealing novel pathways for regulation of
tandemly-replicated gene arrays in vertebrates. In this renewal we drill down to examine the signaling
pathways, receptors, and genetic elements that mediate this regulation, with three Aims: Aim 1. Identify the
receptor(s) that mediate the response of lws1 and lws2 to TH. Aim 2. Identify the regulatory elements on the
lws locus that mediate the response of lws1 and lws2 to TH. Aim 3. Determine the role of TH signaling in
regulating LWS vs. MWS ratios in human cones."
10882157,"ABSTRACT
Sudden cardiac death (SCD), a major public health problem in the US and worldwide, is often caused by a
triggered arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) evolving into ventricular fibrillation. VT is often
preceded and maintained by spontaneous extra beats that do not originate from the sinus node. Those are
thought to occur at the cellular level: Under pathologic conditions of excessive Ca load in the intracellular Ca
stores (sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) and/or malfunctioning ryanodine receptors (RyR2), Ca is released from the
SR during diastole. This induces a transient inward current (Iti), consisting mainly of Na/Ca exchanger (NCX)
current moving Ca out of the cell. Iti depolarizes the cell membrane, generating a delayed afterdepolarization
(DAD). If the DAD is large enough to reach the Na channel activation threshold, an ectopic action potential
(AP) occurs, which then can propagate and cause a triggered arrhythmia on the tissue level. Such diastolic Ca
releases and associated triggered beats are hallmarks of inherited catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia (CPVT) and are also found as an acquired defect after myocardial infarction (MI). Yet, it remains
unclear how NCX can generate enough current to trigger an AP in intact tissue, where ventricular myocytes
are electrically coupled and thus effectively stabilized by a large current sink.
Non-selective large-conductance (200-500 pS) ion channels (LCCs), activated by several mechanisms,
including increase in intracellular Ca ([Ca]i) and/or extracellular ATP ([ATP]o), have been previously reported in
the plasma membrane of ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes. The molecular identity of these LCCs remains
controversial, with number of candidates being proposed, including RyR, transient receptor potential (TRP),
pannexin (Panx) channels, and connexin (Cx43) hemichannels. Our preliminary data from Casq2-/- mice
(calsequestrin knock-out model of CPVT) strongly points toward Panx1 channels as the major candidate,
although Cx43 hemichannels also may be contributing to LCC activity. Our central hypothesis to be tested in
current application is that rapid simultaneous activation of Panx1 in certain pathophysiological conditions may
serve as a significant amplifying and/or synchronizing factor for the Iti elicited by spontaneous diastolic Ca
release, making AP triggering possible and in this way critically contributing to arrhythmia and SCD. The
proposed experiments will investigate if activation of Panx1 by [ATP]o via paracrine signaling pathway
increases the incidence of triggered AP in single cardiomyocytes from Casq2-/- and WT mice and in vivo (Aim
1), test if increased Panx1 expression in cardiac Purkinje cells contributes to their arrhythmogenicity (Aim 2)
and study the effect of Panx modulation on arrhythmia risk using mouse model of acquired (MI, coronary
ligation) triggered arrhythmia pathology. Accomplishing these aims may reveal a new mechanism of arrhythmia
triggering in cardiac pathologies associated with diastolic Ca release and provide a new target for their
therapeutic treatment."

This proposal builds into our ongoing research in genetics and disease risk in admixed Hispanic populations.
Hispanics/Latinos are the larger racial/ethnic minority in the U.S. They have a high burden of cardiometabolic
and inflammatory related diseases. Genetically, Hispanics are an heterogenous population comprised of
multiple ancestral groups (primarily Native American, West African, European) from recent admixture. Few
studies have leveraged genetic ancestry to address differences in disease susceptibility. This study will
leverage the comprehensive data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
Latinos for discovery of ancestry-enriched susceptibility loci. We propose to integrate genomics and multi-
omics data to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher
disease variant frequency (Aim 1), use new approaches for fine-mapping genomic regions (Aim 2), and
validate our findings for clinical relevance in Hispanics/Latinos from the All of Us study (Aim 3). We expect to
gain insights into the identified ancestry-related genomic regions and variants and their relationship to disease
states. This proposal uniquely complements large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results
may provide insights into differences in disease risk in admixed populations. Ultimately this research could
inform personalized medicine and improve public health."

Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYAs; ages 15-39 years) are an important underserved group at
risk for significant financial hardship. There are nearly 90,000 new diagnoses of cancer annually in AYAs, and
nearly 680,000 AYA cancer survivors living in the United States. Five-year survival rates among AYAs are high
(>80%) and AYAs have approximately 35 to 59 years of life expectancy remaining, including 25 to 40 years of
productive employment in the paid workforce. Unfortunately, AYAs with cancer may have inadequate insurance
coverage, limited financial assets, and experience significant work interruption, leading to greater financial
hardship during and after treatment. Thus, AYA cancer survivors are at greater risk of financial hardship than
AYAs without a history of cancer. Interventions to address financial hardship exist, but few address AYAs’ unique
needs, and, to our knowledge, none address determinants of financial hardship, which lie at multiple levels. At
the individual level, AYAs lack financial and health insurance literacy. At the organizational level, assessment of
AYAs’ eligibility for financial support resources is haphazard, and access to financial assistance programs is
uncoordinated. CHAT (“Let’s CHAT about health insurance”) is a program designed to educate AYAs about
health insurance; Lessening the Impact of Financial Toxicity (LIFT) was designed to systematically assess
cancer patients’ eligibility and coordinate access to financial support resources. To address multilevel
determinants of financial hardship among AYAs, LIFT must be combined with CHAT. Combining CHAT with
LIFT may also facilitate implementation in community-based settings, where most AYAs receive cancer care,
yet resources required to implement new interventions are limited. This proposal responds to the National Cancer
Institute’s call “to develop and/or test interventional approaches to prevent and/or mitigate financial hardship in
individuals diagnosed with cancer” by assessing the influence of a multilevel financial hardship intervention on
AYAs’ health insurance literacy and financial hardship. We propose the following specific aims: (1) To
synthesize CHAT and LIFT to create FinFit, an intervention to address the unique, multilevel determinants of
financial hardship among AYAs treated in community oncology practices; (2) to conduct a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of FinFit, a multilevel intervention, to address financial hardship among AYAs (n=408);
and (3) to develop guidance for implementing FinFit to be tested in a future hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial. This study will be the first, real world efficacy trial of a multilevel intervention
to reduce financial hardship among a representative, geographically diverse sample of AYAs treated in
community oncology practices. Study results will guide future efforts to scale up FinFit to the diverse
settings where AYA cancer survivors are served."

consequences for wellbeing. Decades of research have established the importance of the neuropeptide
oxytocin (OT) for social bond formation with reproductive partners. In contrast, very little is known about the
mechanisms supporting selective affiliation between non-mate peers. Prairie voles exhibit a human-like social
structure, forming specific and selective relationships with mates and same-sex peers, unlike other laboratory
rodents. The goal of this project is to understand the roles oxytocin plays in shaping the selectivity of peer
relationships in prairie voles, particularly its dual functions in promoting acceptance of familiar partners and
avoidance of unfamiliar individuals. We will use complementary neuropharmacological and genetic
manipulations to test the necessity and sufficiency of oxytocin signaling for partner approach and stranger
avoidance and aggression. We make use of natural contrasts between reproductive (mate) and non-
reproductive (same-sex peer) relationships in prairie voles, as well as species comparisons between peer
relationships in prairie voles and prior studies in meadow voles to understand the specificity and generality of
these mechanisms. By manipulating oxytocin across multiple circuits, we have a unique opportunity to
determine how OT influences selectivity across brain regions and relationship types. This work has the
potential to elucidate the neural basis of peer relationships, and to provide the foundation for understanding
how prosocial and antisocial factors of relationships are related and mediated. Our long-term goal is to better
understand how friendship-like relationships are established and maintained, and how the mechanisms
underlying social relationships in prairie voles can be translated to human relationships."
10882041,"Healthy skeletal muscle is capable of multiple cycles of regeneration in response to small tears that occur during
daily activity and exercise. Central to this regenerative capacity are the muscle stem cells termed satellite cells
(SCs), which reside in specialized tissue “niches” and in response to injury activate, proliferate, and fuse to form
new or repair damaged muscle fibers. Dysregulation of SC niche leads to loss of muscle repair ability found in
aging, congenital neuromuscular and metabolic disorders, and acquired diseases such as cancer or volumetric
muscle loss. Function of healthy SC niche is regulated by a complex interplay of biochemical and biophysical
inputs from surrounding extracellular matrix, muscle fibers, blood vessels, neurons, immune and connective
tissue cells. While specific roles of these regulatory mechanisms are difficult to dissect in vivo, engineered 3-
dimensional (3D) skeletal muscle tissues offer the opportunity to recapitulate and systematically study SC niche
function in vitro. However, current engineered muscle tissues lack the complex heterocellular milieu of native
muscle, along with the factors known to control SC niche homeostasis and response to injury. Our group has
been the first to engineer 3D functional human skeletal muscle tissues (“myobundles”) from primary myoblasts
and induced pluripotent stem cells and utilize them for studies of muscle exercise, metabolism, inflammation,
drug response, and modeling of congenital muscle diseases. While in human myobundles made of myogenic
cells, SCs attain a peri-myofiber position, quiescent phenotype, and heterogeneity akin to those of native SCs in
vivo, their regenerative response is less robust than observed in native skeletal muscle. We thus propose to
increase the cellular complexity of SC niches in myobundles to approximate that of native skeletal muscle by
incorporating capillary networks and functional motoneurons known to support niche function in vivo. The
improved biomimetic nature of vascularized and innervated myobundles developed in this project will allow us
to further investigate cell-specific roles and cross-cellular interactions regulating the human SC niche
maintenance, heterogeneity, and response to muscle exercise and injury. Ultimately, we anticipate that this novel
heterocellular model of engineered skeletal muscle tissue will enable improved in vitro modeling, mechanistic,
and therapeutic studies of human muscle disorders involving dysregulation of SC niche."
10883414,"In the US, ~100,000 babies are born premature at <34 weeks gestational age (GA) each year, or ~2.7% of all
live births. While infant preterm respiratory, pulmonary vascular, and systemic vascular diseases are common
among those born preterm, many become asymptomatic in early childhood. Yet, emerging data point to
subclinical abnormalities among adult survivors of preterm birth that may ultimately drive their increased rates
of long-term cardiopulmonary complications including obstructive lung disease, pulmonary and systemic
hypertension, and metabolic disease including diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Preterm-born young
adults have systemic evidence of energy metabolism dysregulation, insulin insensitivity and oxidative stress.
This application has four objectives: 1) Understand the cardiopulmonary phenotypic burden of disease among
formerly preterm children (FPC) ages 5-12 years; 2) Evaluate for systemic evidence of metabolic dysregulation
characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance in FPC; 3) Explore mechanisms by
determining whether FPC have systemic molecular signatures of abnormal energy metabolism and
inflammation; and, 4) Incorporate metrics of social determinants of health (SDOH), to understand how
exposures interact with and modify the clinical condition as well as systemic and cellular features. There is a
critical need to determine the burden of disease and mechanistic features during mid-childhood, when early
interventions may change an otherwise predetermined lifespan trajectory toward chronic illness. We propose a
strategy of dense clinical phenotyping paired with molecular studies and information about SDOH. We will
leverage the clinical and research infrastructures built at our three centers over the past twenty or more years
in the care and study of children born preterm. We hypothesize that school age FPC display systemic
metabolic energy dysregulation, characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, with
associated cardiopulmonary abnormalities and suboptimal reactivity to stress challenge, and that these
outcomes may be modified by social determinants of health (SDOH). Establishing a new human cohort of 100
FPC ages 5-12 years, matched by 50 formerly term healthy controls, we will pursue the following Aims: Aim 1:
identify the clinical cardiopulmonary vascular features that characterize FPC; Aim 2: identify the biochemical
markers in circulation that suggest metabolic dysregulation characterized by inflammation, oxidative stress,
and insulin resistance; Aim 3: deeply explore mechanistic drivers by generating expression data from RNA
Sequencing to determine the molecular variations that drive alterations in energy metabolism. In each Aim, we
will integrate the phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular variations with socio-ecologic exposures. These
studies will confirm the presence of cardiopulmonary irregularities among FPC in mid-childhood and connect
these phenotypes with alterations in biochemical and expression markers, as well as SDOH, offering the
foundation for future studies and a step toward personalizing care and surveillance guided by biologic data."
10881233,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dystrophinopathy is a group of X-linked neuromuscular disorders, resulting from mutations in the dystrophin
genes. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and a milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), are the
most common forms of dystrophinopathy. Both types of muscular dystrophy (MD) patients develop progressive
wasting of skeletal muscle and heart failure, and currently there is no absolute cure. Despite extensive
investigation into the management of MD, tools for monitoring the disease progression and the treatment
response are yet to be established. Mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation are indicative metabolic
phenotypes of the severity of dystrophinopathy and precede muscle damage, playing causative roles in the
pathogenesis of MD. Patients with MD have decreased level of glucose in the skeletal muscle and the
myocardium, contributing to the low concentration of downstream metabolites and the subsequent energy
deficiency in the muscle. However, how the myocytes utilize the fuel is underexplored. Pyruvate, the end-product
of glycolysis, is positioned at a unique metabolic junction that can witness both mitochondrial dysfunction and
inflammation via two enzymatic reactions: PDH and LDH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) links glycolysis and
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity is often considered as
a measure for glycolysis or anaerobic respiration and is positively correlated with tissue inflammation. Carbon-
13 (13C) MRI with an intravenous bolus injection of hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C]pyruvate is a unique imaging
method for estimating LDH activity and PDH flux by the in-vivo products, [1-13C]lactate and [13C]bicarbonate,
respectively. Since hyperpolarization technology is using stable isotope (no ionizing radiation) and pyruvate is a
natural metabolite, it is safe to inject HP [1-13C]pyruvate into both adult and pediatric patients. In this proposal,
we will investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in DMD and BMD patients using HP [1-
13C]pyruvate MRI. Thus, the overall goal of the study is to develop non-invasive biomarkers that detect early
metabolic changes associated with myopathies in patients with MD. The underlying hypothesis is that
metabolic alterations in myocardium and skeletal muscle precede myopathies associated with
dystrophinopathy. The specific aims include to develop elevated lactate production as a biomarker for
myocarditis and skeletal muscle inflammation (Aim 1), to develop limited bicarbonate production as a biomarker
of mitochondrial dysfunction (Aim 2), and to assess early changes in lactate-to-bicarbonate ratio in predicting
MD-associated myopathy (Aim 3). The imaging biomarkers will be compared to clinical cardiac parameters (e.g.,
ventricular ejection fraction) and other inflammatory markers or coronary risk indicators from blood samples (e.g.,
high-sensitivity troponin T). The research outcome of the proposed study will develop in-vivo imaging biomarkers
that assess metabolic characteristics of the heart and skeletal muscle in patients with muscular dystrophy, and
set a groundwork for clinical translation of this technique to muscular dystrophy patients."
10883481,"Project Summary:
Craniofacial abnormalities are the most common form of human birth defect, but their molecular basis remains
poorly understood. Highly conserved craniofacial developmental pathways shared across diverse vertebrate
species have been shaped by adaptive evolution to produce a tremendous diversity of adaptive craniofacial
phenotypes. Fundamental investigation of the genetic basis of these phenotypes will lead to better diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of human birth defects. Indeed, complementary or new information on the genetic
basis of many human pathologies can be obtained from naturally occurring organisms, particularly non-model
vertebrates, that display analogous divergent phenotypes, known as ‘evolutionary mutant’ models. These natural
systems are becoming increasingly tractable for genomic and transgenic approaches and provide an opportunity
for ‘evolutionary’ forward genetics.
 Here I propose to build on my lab’s demonstrated success developing a new vertebrate system studying
the genetic basis of highly divergent craniofacial morphology in Caribbean pupfishes. Pupfish exhibit novel
craniofacial features not found in other non-model fish systems and are highly tractable for laboratory studies
with life histories and eggs comparable to zebrafish. Ongoing gene flow and strong selection for divergent
craniofacial features provide an ideal natural ‘experiment’ for fine-mapping candidate variants associated with
these traits. Our initial success confirming three new craniofacial genes in Caribbean pupfishes and identifying
27 candidate craniofacial genes found in other vertebrates demonstrates the power and potential of our
approach.
 I hypothesize that fixed mutations between these species control spatiotemporal expression of
both known and novel craniofacial genes underlying the highly divergent craniofacial features observed
in pupfishes. I propose to investigate the genetic basis of novel adaptive phenotypes in this non-model system
using a combination of population genomics, de novo genome assemblies, phenomics, quantitative genetics,
transcriptomics, in situ hybridization, gene overexpression and chemical inhibition, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome
editing. By integrating candidate gene and variant discovery with functional genetics in a natural system
exhibiting diverse craniofacial features the proposed research will demonstrate the feasibility and power of new
non-model systems to gain novel insights into the developmental genetics of human diseases."
10885119,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiomyopathy affecting 1 in 500 US adults.1,2
Mutation in myosin heavy chain seven (MYH7), a sarcomeric thick filament protein, accounts for 20-40% of HCM
cases.3,4 However, current understanding lacks a generalizable mechanism through which specific MYH7
variants result in HCM, and no specific disease-modifying therapy exists.5 The MYH7 S2 domain, host to
numerous identified pathogenic variants, interacts with the C1C2 domain of cardiac myosin binding protein C
(cMyBP-C).6 We have generated hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from an HCM patient with MYH7
variant E848G. Our preliminary data suggest E848G disrupts the S2/C1C2 interaction and reduces MYH7
abundance. Thus, my central hypothesis is pathogenic MYH7 S2 variants that disrupt S2/C1C2 interaction
and reduce MYH7 protein abundance result in contractile function; restoration of S2/C1C2 interaction
(Aim 1) or MYH7 abundance (Aim 2) may improve contractile function. My specific aims are to: (1)
demonstrate disruption of MYH7 S2/C1C2 interaction results in contractile dysfunction; and (2) elucidate the
mechanism of E848G-induced loss of MYH7 protein abundance and test whether restoring normal MYH7 protein
abundance can rescue contractile function. I will generate pathogenic MYH7 S2 variants with CRISPR/Cas9 for
use in a mammalian two-hybrid approach to quantify dysfunction of the S2/C1C2 interaction. I will restore
S2/C1C2 interaction disrupted by pathogenic MYH7 S2 variant by targeted mutation of the complementary amino
acid in C1C2, ideally recovering contractile function in corresponding engineered heart tissues (EHTs). These
findings will be applied to MYH7 S2 variants of unknown significance to test for S2/C1C2 integrity and verify in
hiPSC-CMs. This aim will establish a novel rapid method to functionally reclassify MYH7 S2 variants of unknown
significance. In the second aim, I will characterize hypocontractility in EHTs derived from MYH7-E848G hiPSC-
CMs and correlate with observed loss in MYH7 protein abundance. I will use fluorescent recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP) to capture the dynamics of MYH7 cycling in sarcomeres with and without the E848G
variant. Overexpression of MYH7 and silencing of the mutant allele will test the relationship between MYH7
abundance and contractile function. These findings will then be corroborated in other MYH7 pathogenic variants.
This aim will establish a generalizable mechanism through which MYH7 variants lose MYH7 protein abundance
and consequently lose contractile function. In sum, these experiments will enable diagnostic tools for predicting
pathogenicity of MYH7 S2 variants and therapeutic approaches to address contractile function. This project will
take place in the highly supportive and collaborative environment of the University of Washington Department of
Medicine. With the mentorship of my Sponsor and Co-Sponsor (Dr. Daniel Yang and Dr. Charles E. Murry,
respectively), this project will provide the training required for me to realize my goal of establishing an
independent research laboratory at the crossroads of cellular biology, tissue engineering, and clinical application."

10884682,"Project Summary
 An estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s dementia in 2020. The
majority of these individuals are cared for at home by family members. Caring for people living with dementia
(PLWD) can be very stressful, and is associated with negative mental health outcomes, including depression
and anxiety. The chronic stress of caregiving has also been associated with increased levels of
proinflammatory biomarkers, which mediate many of the chronic diseases of aging. High levels of cognitive
empathy have been associated with lower levels of subjective stress and depression among dementia
caregivers. Cognitive empathy is the ability to adopt another individual’s mental perspective and to understand
what they are thinking or feeling and why. The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of cognitive
empathy training on mental health, inflammation and immune function in caregivers of PLWD, and to examine
the underlying psychological and neurobiological mechanisms. Our first aim is to establish the effectiveness of
cognitive empathy training in improving caregiver mental health and immune function, and in decreasing
caregiver inflammation. In a cross-over design, caregivers will be randomized to either cognitive empathy
training or a control condition. Prior to the training, caregivers will complete questionnaires on perceived
caregiver burden, depression and anxiety. A bloodspot sample will be collected to assay levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and CRP), and Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers as a marker of
cellular immune function. The training involves caregivers taking 3-5 daily photos of their PLWD with their
smartphone over a 10-day period. After taking each photo, caregivers caption it with text that describes what
the caregiver believes the PLWD is thinking, feeling or experiencing in that moment. The exercise is
subsequently repeated for a single day, at two-week intervals for six months. Immediately after the 10-day
training, and again at 6 months post-training, caregivers will again complete the questionnaires and provide
bloodspot samples. Changes from the pre-training baseline will be calculated. Our second aim is to investigate
the psychological and neurobiological mechanism by which cognitive empathy training improves caregiver
well-being, inflammation and immune function. Caregiver cognitive and emotional empathy, as well as dyadic
relationship quality, will be quantified with self-report questionnaires both pre- and post-training. In addition,
brain function will be measured with fMRI as caregivers view photos of their PLWD and attempt to empathize
with them. Finally, caregivers will also be interviewed for a qualitative assessment of the impact of the training
on relationship and caregiving quality. We hypothesize that the training will increase activation in brain regions
involved with cognitive empathy along with self-reported cognitive empathy, and improve caregiver/recipient
relationship quality, immune function and mental health, while at the same time decreasing inflammation."

Dr. Aileen Wright, MD, MS, is an Instructor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Department of
Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Her long-term goal is to become an independent
physician scientist bridging the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare. To this end, Dr. Wright
seeks a mentored career development award to develop an AI-assisted clinical decision support (CDS) tool for
diabetes care. Hypoglycemia is the most common complication of insulin therapy, and has been associated
with increased risk of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, falls, length of stay, and mortality. Due to the severe
consequences of hypoglycemia, insulin therapy is on the Institute for Safe Medication Practices’ list of high-risk
medications and insulin-induced hypoglycemia has been designated a “never event”. Models to predict
hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients have been developed, and could be implemented as CDS tools to
improve the safety of insulin therapy. However, published models could benefit from improvements in
accuracy. Furthermore, these models have not yet translated to tangible clinical outcomes as they have not
been integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). For AI-assisted CDS tools to be effective, they must be
developed with clinician input throughout the design process to ensure tools are utilized, fits into the clinician
workflow, and reduce clinical workload rather than increasing cognitive burden. CDS which is not accurate and
fits poorly into the clinician workflow, can contribute to ‘alert fatigue’, user dissatisfaction with the EHR, and
clinician burnout. The objective of this proposed study is to use state-of-the-art machine learning methods and
human-centered design processes to develop a high performing AI-assisted CDS tool for preventing
hypoglycemia in hospitalized, non-critically ill adults. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) validate and
extend existing inpatient hypoglycemia models, 2) expand feature space and apply deep learning to
hypoglycemia prediction, and 3) integrate and prospectively validate prediction models for diabetes care. Dr.
Wright is a practicing general internal medicine physician who has completed a fellowship in biomedical
informatics. During the award period, Dr. Wright’s research and career objectives include broadening her
methodological foundation in machine learning to include deep learning techniques, gaining experience
integrating clinical prediction models into the EHR, and forging new collaborations in informatics and clinical
medicine. These objectives will be met through a combination of didactic coursework, mentored research, and
career development activities. This award will facilitate Dr. Wright’s transition to an independent investigator
who develops, implements, and evaluates AI-assisted CDS tools to transform healthcare, preventing harm for
patients with diabetes and lifting burdens for clinicians."
10889669,"Summary
This is a revised R01 application from a team of established investigators who bring complementary expertise
for a multi-omics, hypothesis generating, series of experiments that have the overarching goal of deepening
understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Taken together, the prevalence of this
devastating disorder, the paucity of efficacious treatments, and the very high failure rate of clinical trials for new
AD treatments indicate a pressing need to better understand how this disease breaks the brain. We posit that
measures of protein function, rather than gene expression, are needed to develop a more sophisticated
understanding of AD progression. Protein function can be measured in many ways. Genetic or
pharmacological manipulation provides compelling insights for causal relationships between proteins. Such
work relies on assumptions about biological function that are linear. However, the sum of the properties of
individual components may not model whole systems, and orchestration of complex systems may not be
explained by individual components. This is particularly true for protein kinase signaling, where overlap,
crosstalk, and reversibility of phosphorylation events makes for non-linear networks. In this proposal, we
embrace this complexity with a series of experiments designed to assess these typically non-linear networks.
We plan to assess the serine/threonine subkinome using an unbiased protein kinase activity array approach.
Combined with bioinformatics tools that yield protein kinase networks and nodes, we hypothesize that higher
order information regarding signaling networks in AD progression will yield novel insights about the disease.
The biological substrates for this study will include postmortem brain from control, mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), and AD subjects, as well as iPSC-derived neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia cultures from sporadic (late
onset) and familial AD cases. AD progression will be assessed with early, intermediate, and late timepoints in
AD iPSC cultures, and by comparing control vs MCI and MCI vs AD postmortem samples. Deliverables include
1) identification of protein kinases networks and nodes associated with AD progression, 2) validation of protein
kinase nodes during AD progression between and across postmortem and iPSC substrates, and 3)
advancement of validated protein kinase nodes for causal studies in human AD iPSCs. Effects of sex will be
assessed as a secondary outcome, with equal numbers of male and female samples for each AD substrate.
LCMS datasets will be generated in parallel to kinome array datasets, permitting multi-omics integration. All
datasets will be incorporated into an R-Shiny platform that integrates biological features of protein kinases.
Importantly, the preliminary data for this proposal demonstrate that this project is low-risk, high reward, as we
have performed a series of rigorous studies that identify candidate protein kinase network nodes and carefully
advance and validate a candidate node previously implicated in AD that has not been studied in human model
systems. For these reasons, we believe that this project is highly impactful with a high probability of success."
10889670,"Project Summary/Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive, highly prevalent lifelong
disorders for which pharmacological interventions are not readily available. While genetic factors are likely
contributors to these disorders, heritability estimates indicate strong environmental contributions. Of significant
interest is the link between fetal gestation and the activation of the maternal immune system during critical
periods of development. Epidemiological reports suggest a strong association between periods of maternal
immune activation - including immune conditions such as allergies and asthma - and an increased risk of
having a child with ASD. Acute exacerbations are common in pregnant asthmatic women, with as many as
35% suffering attacks requiring hospitalization. In addition, particulate matter from air pollution, a major
exacerbating factor in allergic asthma, has been linked with an increased risk for ASD. This is particularly
concerning given the increasing presence of particulate matter from wildfires, which are becoming more
frequent and severe. Despite this, the consequences of gestational exposure to maternal asthma/allergy-
mediated responses, wildfire particulate matter (WPM), or their combined effects on fetal development remain
largely unknown. We recently developed a preclinical model of maternal allergic asthma (MAA) during
gestation that alters neurobiology and microglial function and disrupts epigenetic mechanisms in offspring. We
have WPM samples collected in situ and through proximity sampling of wildfire emissions, capturing the
complexity of real-world complex WPM exposures. We will test the innovative hypothesis that WPM and MAA
combined are causally linked to altered microglia activation and function and that these exposures lead to
epigenetic modifications of microglia that will enable us to discover gene pathways that diverge or converge
between the two exposures. The proposed studies will examine WPM alone and the exacerbating effects of
WPM sampled from the Northern California region during fire season plus MAA on microglia activation and
function (Aim #1). Environmental exposures during critical windows in early life can impact epigenetic
mechanisms, and the developing brain is particularly susceptible to these changes. Over-activation of the
maternal immune system, for instance, can lead to an over-activation of the fetal immune system, potentially
hindering brain development. We will test the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms in microglia are altered
by combined WPM + MAA (Aim #2). If successful, this research will validate the concept that
neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD is, for some, caused by environmental contaminants that alter
immune mechanisms. Our findings could identify novel mechanisms and preventative strategies for one of the
most visible public health concerns of our time."
10891477,"Herpes  stromal  keratitis  (HSK)  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  condition  that  develops  in  response  to  a  recurrent 
corneal  infection  with  herpes  simplex  virus-­1  (HSV-­1).  HSK  is  the  leading  cause  of  infection-­induced  corneal 
blindness  in  the  United  States.  Clinical  manifestation  of  HSK  involves  the  development  of  opacity  and 
neovascularization into the avascular cornea. Newly formed leaky blood vessels in the corneal stroma obscure 
the visual axis, traffic the leukocytes (mostly neutrophils) into the inflamed cornea, and cause the corneal edema. 
The  current  mainstay  of  HSK  treatment  requires  the  long-­term  use  of  oral  antiviral  drugs  and  the  topical 
application  of  steroids.  The  prolonged  use  of  topical  steroids  causes  a  predisposition  to  herpetic  reactivation, 
cataract  development,  and  increased  intraocular  pressure  (IOP),  which  may  cause  the  development  of 
glaucoma. A better understanding of cellular and molecular events involved in the pathogenesis of HSK could 
provide  novel  therapeutic  targets  to  reduce  the  severity  of  HSK.  The  focus  of  this  application  is  to  understand 
the mechanisms by which Insulin-­like growth factor binding protein-­3 (IGFBP-­3) regulates the pathogenesis of 
HSK. IGFBP-­3 exerts its effect through insulin-­like growth factor (IGF)-­independent and-­dependent mechanisms. 
In  an  IGF-­independent  manner,  IGFBP-­3  is  known  to  induce  cellular  senescence.  The  cellular  senescence  is 
reported to inhibit viral replication. The IGF-­dependent activity of IGFBP-­3 involves sequestration of IGF-­1 and 
IGF-­2  molecules  and  limiting  their  bioavailability  to  IGF-­1R,  and  thereby  regulates  IGF-­1R  signaling.  Our 
preliminary results showed an elevated expression of IGFBP-­3 in HSV-­1 infected corneas of B6 mice, whereas 
a  significantly  reduced  amount  of  IGFBP-­3  protein  was  detected  in  the  circulation  of  infected  B6  mice  when

increased  viral  load.  Besides,  increased  phosphorylation  of  IGF-­1R,  the  first  step  in  IGF-­1R  signaling,  was 
determined  in  leukocytes  infiltrating  the  HSK  developing  corneas  of  IGFBP-­3  KO  than  B6  mice.  A  significant 
increase  in  hemangiogenesis  and  opacity  was  measured  in  infected  corneas  of  IGFBP-­3  KO  than  B6  mice. 
Together,  these  results  led  us  to  hypothesize  that  IGFBP-­3  enhances  viral  clearance,  reduces  angiogenesis, 
and  decreases  the  survival  and  effector  function  of  myeloid  cells  in  HSK  developing  corneas.  Therefore,

Studies of human pancreas development have begun to elucidate influences in the establishment of β cell
mass and formation of islets, but genetic and environmental influences that manifest during postnatal pancreas
development remain unknown. The first decade of life (termed the pediatric period for this proposal) is a
dynamic time in pancreas development when two critcal processes occur: (1) β cell mass is established and
(2) β cells and islets functionally mature. In addition, it is the time β cell-directed autoimmunity of type 1
diabetes (T1D) often begins. Thus, understanding the molecular and cellular processes that govern pediatric
pancreas development and function is key to improving the diagnosis of children and adolescents with T1D
and T2D and developing strategies to prevent, or treat the β cell dysfunction. While several ongoing initiatives
including the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) have been generating datasets from adult nondiabetic,
T1D, and T2D donors, there is a major gap in deep molecular and tissue-level phenotyping of pancreata from
the pediatric period. Furthermore, the contributions of vascular, immune, and other stromal cell populations
and their β cell interactions, to human pediatric pancreas development are largely uncharacterized, despite
their known influence on adult β cell function. Our proposal is based on our exciting single-cell multi-omic
spatially-resolved pilot data that will allow us to map the context specificity of T1D and related trait GWAS
signals in pancreas across cell type, age, sex, and developmental stage. Moreover, using living slice
technology, we will be able to investigate cellular physiology and cell-cell communication in situ with high
temporal resolution to provide an insight into processes that govern β cell maturation and establishment of
healthy pancreatic architecture. The overlay of spatial, physiological, transcriptional, and chromatin data from
the same organs will provide unprecedented access to define changes in molecular signatures, tissue
architecture, and β cell maturation. This will not only complement phenotypic data collected from mostly adult
donors in the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP), but will also generate data useful to several HIRN
consortia and the broader research community. Our multidisciplinary research team with complementary
expertise in pancreas and islet biology, in situ physiology, single cell genomics and epigenomics, image data
analysis, statistical genetics, and machine learning devised tools and analyses to discover cell state dynamic
changes across the first decade of life and define how these changes influence downstream biology from
transcriptional regulation, to cellular spatial organization within the pancreas, and cellular function. If
successful, these studies will provide new mechanistic insights about the functional maturation of human β
cells during the critical pediatric life stages. This will likely influence the way we perceive T1D pathogenesis
and lead to new therapies for diabetes and other pancreas diseases."

Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, explosive transmission of infection has occurred in jails and prisons.
The spillover of infection between jails, prisons, and surrounding communities is fueled by high churn of the
incarcerated population and daily cycling of correctional staff between facility and community. Failure to control
transmission in correctional settings has resulted in significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and
contributed to continuing racial health disparities. Despite emerging evidence of disproportionate spread of
SARS-CoV-2 infection arising from jails and prisons, few studies have examined transmission dynamics in
correctional settings or evaluated interventions to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The objective of
this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to equip Dr. Levintow with essential training in
criminal justice research and infectious disease modeling to investigate the dynamic processes that drive
SARS-CoV-2 transmission and advance intervention efforts to prevent COVID-19 morbidity and mortality,
focusing on jails in North Carolina (NC). Specifically, a K01 award will provide substantive knowledge of the
criminal justice system and infectious diseases in that context (Training Aim 1), methodological expertise in
mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics (Training Aim 2), and new skills in linking system-level
policy and interventions to epidemiological outcomes (Training Aim 3). Leveraging this training, Dr. Levintow
will apply new expertise about infectious diseases in the criminal justice system to assess the extent to which
population movement, COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 cases in NC jails are predicted by jail characteristics
(Research Aim 1). Guided by intensive training in the development, calibration, and analysis of mathematical
models, Dr. Levintow will estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence in NC jails and corresponding excess infection
relative to surrounding communities (Research Aim 2). With new knowledge of existing and proposed
interventions in jails – coupled with new skills to rigorously assess their effects – Dr. Levintow will evaluate the
impact of those interventions on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Research Aim 3). Study findings will inform
prioritization of interventions with greatest impact for the highly vulnerable populations in NC jails and their
surrounding communities across the state. This study will benefit from the institutional resources of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will be guided by a mentoring team of leading experts with
extensive experience examining infectious disease in the criminal justice system and conducting modeling
analyses to inform interventions on spread of infection. This K01 award will provide both the training needed to
accomplish the proposed research and the support necessary to launch Dr. Levintow's independence as an
infectious disease epidemiologist, laying the groundwork for R01-level research expanded to the national level
and to other infectious diseases with potential for explosive outbreaks in jails and prisons."
10891510,"Project Summary/Abstract
The study of the genetic basis for type 1 diabetes (T1D) has benefited tremendously from examination of rare
individuals with likely monogenic forms of the disease. Combined with GWAS, a number of polymorphisms in
immune regulatory genes have been defined that contribute to genetic risk for T1D. Using whole exome
sequencing of individuals with T1D enrolled in a monogenic diabetes registry, we identified an individual with a
gain-of-function mutation in the SKAP2 gene, as well as several other T1D patients with potentially pathogenic
variants in other leukocyte integrin signaling genes. These patients tend to have a number of autoimmune
manifestations in addition to T1D, indicating defects in critical pathways of immune tolerance. Multiple GWAS
studies have identified a strong genetic linkage between SKAP2 polymorphisms and T1D (at a frequency of
~20%), however the mechanisms by which alteration of SKAP2 could lead to autoimmune T1D are unknown.
SKAP2 is expressed primarily in myeloid cells, where it functions as an adapter protein in the integrin signaling
pathway, linking cell surface integrins to WASP and actin rearrangements that occur following leukocyte
adhesion. The SKAP2 G153R mutation in our patient resulted in constitutive association of SKAP2 with WASP
leading to a hyperadhesive phenotype in macrophages cultured from the patient or macrophages engineered
to contain the SKAP G153R substitution. To understand how activation of leukocyte integrin signaling may
contribute to T1D, we have generated knock-in (KI) mice containing the G153R substitution in murine Skap2,
on the NOD genetic background. Female NOD.SKAP2 KI mice have a higher incidence and earlier onset of
T1D than do NOD.WT animals; male NOD.SKAP2 also develop T1D (incidence ~50%) while male NOD.WT
do not develop frank hyperglycemia. Initial analysis of these mice reveals evidence of ongoing inflammation
early in life with development of a broad spectrum of auto-reactive antibodies. Dendritic cells from
NOD.SKAP2 KI mice have increased antigen presenting activity to islet-specific transgenic T-cells while
neutrophils from these mice show evidence of increased integrin signaling. These observations demonstrate
that the NOD.SKAP2 KI mice appropriately model the autoimmune T1D disease observed in our patient. The
project proposes to complete the analysis of these mice, under the hypothesis that increased cell adhesion in
dendritic cells leads to prolonged DC-T cell interactions, which drives selection of auto-reactive T-cell clones
leading to development of T1D, associated with broad spectrum autoimmunity. We will test this hypothesis in
a variety of adoptive cell transfer experiments, by generation of conditional knock-in mice and by imaging of
DC-T cell interactions in the inflamed islets. Similar studies will be performed for other candidate leukocyte
integrin signaling mutations identified in the monogenic T1D registry. This study will address whether
dysregulation of leukocyte integrin signaling may constitute an unrecognized genetic risk factor for T1D,
suggesting potential alterative therapeutic approaches for these patients."

Mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency (ID) remains widespread worldwide among pregnant and lactating women
who have higher dietary requirements than the general population. Iodine is required for the synthesis of
thyroid hormone, which is essential for human brain development, particularly visual attention, fine motor
development, language and memory. The benefits of iodine supplementation for severe ID during pregnancy
and in childhood have been established. However, the effects of iodine supplementation in settings with mild-
to-moderate ID and during lactation remain unclear. Furthermore, few trials to date have examined the effects
of iodine supplementation in pregnancy or lactation on iodine-specific neural functions. In response to NICHD
NOSI (NOT-HD-19-039), we present a unique opportunity to build upon an ongoing, randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to address the consequences of iodine deficiency on fetal and infant neurodevelopment in a population
of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency in rural Ethiopia. In the funded parent pregnancy trial, women in early
pregnancy are randomized to receive a package of strengthened nutrition support (including monthly supply of
iodized salt) and/or a package of infection control. The funded parent pregnancy trial will determine the effect
of the interventions on infant birth outcomes. With support from this award, we propose to add a lactation
intervention utilizing an efficient 2x2 factorial design and randomize women after delivery to receive a) an
intensive iodized salt intervention, including provision of a monthly supply of high-quality, adequately iodized
salt and counseling regarding appropriate storage and use, or b) standard care, until 6 months post-
partum. Our overall goal is to examine the effects of iodine in pregnancy and lactation on infant brain function,
as well as maternal and infant iodine status and thyroid function. The specific aims of this project are to: (1)
determine the effects of an intensive salt intervention in pregnancy and lactation on infant visual evoked
potentials (primary outcome), as well as visual attention, motor function, and head circumference at 6 months
of age; (2) determine the effect of the iodized salt intervention on maternal breast milk iodine concentration, as
well as infant iodine status and thyroid function; and (3) examine interactions between iron and iodine on
thyroid function in pregnancy and lactation. Globally, salt iodization is the primary intervention strategy for
iodine delivery. To our knowledge, this trial will be the first rigorous, adequately powered RCT of high-fidelity
iodized salt provision along the continuum of pregnancy and lactation in a setting of mild-moderate iodine
deficiency. These discoveries will improve our understanding of the role of iodine in early human brain
development in order to develop effective targeted intervention strategies to improve iodine status and
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children worldwide."

applying these methods and insights in their local implementation activities. The MERC will also conduct
original research applying state-of-the-art economic and simulation modeling expertise to understand and
address the overdose crisis. Since 2015, we have worked collaboratively to lead a highly successful multi-
institutional NIDA-funded national center of excellence, the Center for Health Economics of Treatment
Interventions for Substance Use Disorder, HCV, and HIV (CHERISH). We are thus uniquely qualified to lead
the HEAL D2A MERC with the following aims: 1) to support the HEAL D2A Innovation Projects by providing
methodological consultation on the application of rigorous modeling techniques, cost analyses, and behavioral
economic strategies to support the projects' selection and implementation of evidence-based practices to
address service delivery needs; 2) to develop tools that can be readily used by the Innovation Projects to make
informed decisions about the relative costs of different implementation interventions to different stakeholders,
to measure the overall costs of these efforts, and to inform the design of appropriate payment systems that
support sustainability; 3) to use meta-modeling techniques to develop a user-friendly interface so that
simulation model results generated for one system or community can be adapted for other
systems/communities or adapted when local circumstances change; 4) to conduct novel research using
advanced modeling and health economics approaches that build on existing data to provide insights into the
complex dynamics of addressing the overdose crisis through strategic implementation of evidence-based
practices. The HEAL D2A MERC will support the application of health economics and modeling research to
real-world decision making about services to prevent or treat opioid use disorder and pain, will further scientific
innovation in the field, and will establish a paradigm for integrating health economics and modeling into
substance use treatment and prevention policies at the system level. The HEAL D2A MERC will be

10891637,"Project Summary
Opioid use, dependence, and addiction have increased to epidemic proportions in recent years, leading to
substantial financial and societal health burdens. More than 20% of pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid are
prescribed opioids; In recent years there was a 14-fold increase in the proportion of pregnant women self-
reporting opioid abuse. As a result, the incidence of infants born to opioid-using mothers has increased >400%
between 2000 and 2012. These newborns are often treated with opioids, further increasing their exposure to
these substances. Infants with intrauterine exposure to opioids have an increased risk for neurodevelopmental
problems or adverse sensory, cognitive, psychomotor, and behavioral outcomes, negative outcomes that last
through childhood, and likely throughout life. Currently, there is virtually no information regarding neural-circuit
adaptations occurring in with opioid exposure during early life.
We developed a mouse model in which animals are treated with fentanyl during a period corresponding to
human gestation. These mice display lasting alterations in emotional behaviors that are specific to sex.
Adolescent males exposed to perinatal fentanyl show enhanced anxiety-like behavior, while adolescent
females show reduced motivation. Our studies will investigate alterations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
and nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuitry known to be involved in these emotional behaviors. We will investigate
cellular, plasticity, and molecular adaptations in mPFC and NAc cell subtypes in perinatal fentanyl exposed
mice at early post weaning until adolescence. We will target identified molecular adaptations in distinct cell
subtypes to determine their role in circuit and emotional behavioral disruptions occurring with perinatal fentanyl
exposure. Our studies will, for the first time, uncover cellular, circuit, and molecular adaptations occurring after
perinatal exposure to fentanyl and determine the circuitry mediating the long lasting neurobiological anomalies
that occur with perinatal opioid exposure."
10887922,"By age 50, most women will have had uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) with a lifetime cumulative incidence of ~70%
for White women and >80% for Black women. Approximately 25% of women with fibroids experience symptoms
severe enough to cause them to seek clinical care. Although they are a significant healthcare burden for many
individuals, the etiology and pathophysiology of fibroids is poorly understood. Fibroids are the most common
reason for hysterectomy in the US, yet fibroid incidence and symptomatology are poorly understood. The current
gap in knowledge about the etiology and pathophysiology of the disease has contributed to the lack of safe and
effective long-term strategies for women with the disease. Very little is known about the underlying mechanisms
that lead to fibroid development. One of the main reasons that fibroid biology is poorly understood is the lack of
a good model system to study the disease. Perhaps, the best model available is a kidney capsule xenograft
model in immunocompromised mice but their translational potential is not clear. Several other animal models,
including some genetically modified mice, have been proposed for fibroid research, but each has significant
limitations that prevent their widespread use in the laboratory. Our goal is to develop a standardized and reliable
orthotopic baboon model for uterine fibroid research, which we propose to do in two phases. There are several
reasons for choosing the baboon for this purpose. The baboon is not endangered, has been used by many
laboratories to study reproductive biology because of the species phylogenetic similarity to humans and most
importantly, baboons develop spontaneous uterine fibroids, themselves, a trait shared by all primates examined.
In Phase 1 of the project, we propose to develop stable, immortalized, and clonal baboon myometrial cell lines
that mimic uterine fibroid cells from human as closely as possible with the following Aims: establish baboon
immortalized myometrial cell lines that correspond to the most common genetic subtypes observed in human
fibroids and perform in vitro and in vivo assays to select the most promising cell lines for transplantation into
baboon hosts. Successful completion of these aims will allow us to apply for R01 funding to perform Phase 2 of
the project, the orthotopic allograft assays baboons with our collaborators."
10887926,"Mindfulness (M) in this proposal is focused on attention to breathing given the limited scope of R21. Breath plays an important role in mindfulness.  First, since M uses the breath as an anchor, the brain rhythm of the awareness of breath is expected to be correlated with the rhythm of breathing.  Secondly, as M can change the breathing pattern without consciously controlling it, the rhythm of breathing should also be correlated with the rhythm of specific brain regional activities significantly affected by the breathing.  Hence we propose to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain-body interaction of M by mapping the regional brain responses to breathing at both the brainstem and the higher brain. Brainmapping from the brainstem to the hypothalamus and thalamus with extension to higher brain is used to obtain evidence-based regional results relevant to benefits of clinical interest for M.  Since the breathing rate of M can be much slower than that of spontaneous breathing (S), we will compare the brain responses to breathing between M and slow-paced breathing at six breaths per minute (P).
Breathing is characterized in this proposal by respiratory gas exchange (RGE) of O2 and CO2.  The RGE metric of choice is breath-by-breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER) which takes both O2 and CO2 into account and was shown to be superior to the more common ventilatory parameters of breathing rate and variability in correlation with the rhythm of cerebral hemodynamic fluctuations (CHF).  bER-CHF correlation which maps brain responses to the RGE components of breathing is most significant at the frequency range below 0.03Hz which provides new physiological information outside the range (0.05 Hz and above) routinely investigated for low frequency heart rate variability and blood pressure variation.  bER-CHF correlation is an especially suitable probe for brainstem functions because RGE reflects not only ventilation but also cardiac output.  Cardiorespiratory coupling had been reported in the literature of M and P to contribute to the modulation of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), blood pressure, awareness and sleep-wake cycle, all critical health-related functions regulated at the brainstem respiratory and cardiac control networks with connection to the ascending arousal network.  
Despite sharing similar characteristics of slower breathing, M and P have opposite RGE outcomes as breathing for M tends to be shallow while breathing for P can be deep. The RGE characteristics of M share certain features with non-REM sleep such as lower systemic O2 level attributed to the health benefits of relaxation even though M with full awareness is not sleep.   Our pilot brainmapping findings demonstrated the potential to clarify the neuromechanisms of M vs. P by showing regions with significant bER-CHF correlation applicable to M but not to P together with significant regions common to M and P. 
M and P modulate also the variation in heart rate (HR). fMRI mapping of bER-CHF correlation and HR-CHF correlation will be obtained during M, P and S in experienced mindfulness practitioners and naïve volunteers."
10886270,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The human transcriptome contains tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although
lncRNAs are involved in many basic biological processes and their dysregulation implicated in human disease,
only a handful have been functionally and mechanistically studied to date. This is largely due to lack of efficient
tools for lncRNA knockdown, imaging, and biochemical characterization, combined with evidence suggesting
that many lncRNAs may be nonfunctional or function only in a context-specific manner. The overall goal of this
proposal is to identify and characterize functional lncRNAs in human cells, deepening our understanding of
fundamental RNA biology while laying the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis and treatment.
 To overcome prior technical limitations in studying lncRNAs, this work will take advantage of my newly
developed RNA-targeting CRISPR-Csm methodology. This tool enables highly efficient knockdown of both
nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs with limited off-targets and cytotoxicity. When fused to GFP or other proteins,
the tool also enables programmable live-cell RNA imaging or tagging without genetic manipulation.
 The specific aims of this project are thus to: 1) adapt CRISPR-Csm technology for high-throughput
screening to enable investigation of thousands of lncRNAs in parallel; 2) perform an RNA imaging screen to
identify candidate functional lncRNAs based on interesting morphology and subcellular localization; 3) perform
an RNA knockdown screen to inform lncRNA function based on changes in single-cell transcriptome profile; 4)
perform proximity labeling experiments to inform lncRNA mechanism based on interacting protein network.
 Significant findings relevant to the fields of CRISPR technology, noncoding RNA, and gene regulation
are expected. Areas of additional scientific training that will enable successful completion of this work include
experience conducting high-throughput CRISPR screens, in situ sequencing technique/image analysis, and
single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by Dr. Jennifer
Doudna, a world-renowned leader in RNA biology and CRISPR technology. Professional development
activities centered around laboratory management, grant writing, and faculty search preparation will be
completed to gain the remaining skills necessary before running my own lab. The excellent research
environment of the Innovative Genomics Institute at UC Berkeley, combined with the expertise of my Scientific
Advisory Committee, will ensure the successful and timely completion of this work and my transition to
independence."
10886692,"Abstract
Clonal outgrowths are observed across a wide range of normal human tissues. They also appear during the
course of cancer evolution, leading to clonal heterogeneity that fuels the development of treatment-resistant
disease. Clones harbor somatic mutations in known cancer driver genes and show evidence of positive
selection. Nevertheless, how these driver mutations alter the cellular states of cells to allow clones to
outcompete wildtype counterparts remains poorly understood. To date, efforts to chart clonal outgrowths in
normal or malignant human tissues have been largely limited to genotyping. This is due to the fact that these
clones often affect a minority of cells in a sample without distinguishing cell-surface markers.
To address this challenge, we developed an array of multi-omic single-cell technologies that are capable of
capturing multiple layers of information (e.g., genotypes, transcriptomes, methylomes, protein expression) from
the same single cells. Moreover, we addressed the specific challenge of genotyping in scRNA-seq in single
cells at high throughput by developing Genotyping of Targeted loci (GoT). Importantly, GoT turns the admixture
of mutant and wildtype hematopoiesis from a limitation to an advantage, enabling the direct comparison of
mutant (“winner”) and wildtype (“loser”) cells within the same individual.
Given the increasing adoption of our GoT platform, we now aim to extend the multi-omics single-cell toolkit to
study how somatic mutations lead to clonal growth advantage. We will integrate GoT with Cellular Indexing of
Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) to yield GoT-CITE, which will add the critical layer of
cell surface marker phenotyping to single-cell whole transcriptomes. As mutations in splicing factors are
specifically associated with greater risk of malignant transformation, we will develop and implement GoT-
Splice, where long-read sequencing will be used to define splicing variation as a function of cell identity. Given
the high frequency of epigenetic mutations in cancer, we will also develop and apply targeted single-cell
genotyping in the context of chromatin accessibility (GoT-ChA). Finally, as clone growth will also be
determined by its interaction with the microenvironment, to define clonal driver genotypes in its spatial context,
we will adapt spatial transcriptomics (ST) to add the critical feature of genotyping (GoT-ST).
Our overarching goal is to invoke multi-omic comparisons at the single-cell level between wildtype and mutant
cells to comprehensively identify the underpinnings of fitness advantage in clonal outgrowth. The proposed
comprehensive GoT toolkit will enable the linking, at high throughout, single-cell genotypes with transcriptional,
protein, epigenetic and spatial phenotypes. We anticipate that these advances will transform the study of clonal
mosaicism as a harbinger of cancer, as well as resistance to cancer therapies."
10886696,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to increase the ability of researchers to create faithful mouse and stem-cell
models of human cancers and other diseases. Currently available genetic-engineering approaches, including
the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has revolutionized genome editing, lack the capacity for efficient integration of
large DNA constructs (> 10 kilobases; kb) in mouse zygotes and mouse and human stem cells. This limitation
significantly hinders the modeling of human diseases, including cancer. For example, tandem duplications (TDs),
super-enhancers (SEs; large clusters of transcriptional enhancers), and large non-coding structural variants have
been linked to human diseases, including cancers, but available technologies do not permit modeling such large
variants in whole animals or cell lines. To fill this gap, we will develop a gene-editing toolbox that couples the
precision of the CRISPR-Cas9 system with the fidelity and efficiency of the serine integrase Bxb1 to enable
rapid, efficient insertion of large DNA constructs in mice, mouse embryonic stem cells, and human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Bxb1 integrase uses DNA attachment sites (attP in the genome, attB in the
donor DNA) as substrates for catalyzing efficient transgenesis. We show that our innovative Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox
can precisely integrate DNA constructs up to ~43 kb in length in mice. Here, in three aims we will further develop
and validate the toolbox to enable precise transgenesis of large DNA constructs (~100 kb) and to facilitate
generation of DNA rearrangements. Aim 1: Optimize the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for insertion of large DNA (10 to
100 kb) constructs into mouse zygotes. We will use reporter constructs with differing lengths to determine the
maximum length of DNA construct that can be inserted efficiently, and will validate a one-step protocol for rapid
generation of transgenic mice without the need to first generate and characterize mice with attachment sites.
Aim 2: Generate mouse and hiPSC models of human diseases, including cancer, using the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox.
Using our toolbox to insert large genomic variants, we will generate a mouse model of breast cancer (insertion
of a 23.7-kb TD), hiPSC model of triple negative breast cancer (27.2-kb SE), and mouse model of Hirschsprung
disease (~80-kb human risk allele). Aim 3: Enable use of the Cas9-Bxb1 toolbox for generation of DNA
rearrangements. In cre-lox recombination systems, cre catalyzes recombination between two loxP sites flanking
a target locus, enabling diverse DNA rearrangements. Studies suggest that cre-recombination efficacy is limited
by the inter-loxP-site distance and the particular genomic site targeted. We will determine whether the Cas9-
Bxb1 toolbox is more efficient than cre-lox for generation of DNA rearrangements, by determining Bxb1-mediated
recombination efficacy at different inter-attP/attB distances. Successful completion of this project will provide the
community with three new models for future studies, and a versatile tool for development of novel and improved
mouse and hiPSC models of cancer and other diseases."
10886765,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 70% of breast cancer are ERα+ and endocrine therapy is the standard treatment for these patients.
Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapy develops over time and remains a major problem. The cause for
resistance is not fully understood, but aberrant ERα activation is an underlying factor. Therefore, identifying new
component of the ERα signaling and understanding its role in breast cancer holds a great promise for treatment
of ERα+ cancer and will particularly benefit patients with advanced and metastatic tumors that are refractory to
current endocrine therapies. Our preliminary results showed that chromatin remodeling protein AT-rich
interaction domain 4B (ARID4B) is an essential transcription co-activator (not a co-repressor) for ERα and
mammary gland-specific ablation of Arid4b inhibits tumorigenesis. Analyses of large-scale genomic datasets
(TCGA and other breast cancer cohorts), genome-wide transcriptome, and IHC analyses showed that ARID4B
is amplified and its expression elevated in ERα+ breast cancer. Interestingly, high ARID4B expression in ERα+
(but not ERα-) breast cancers is associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence and decreased survival,
suggesting that ARID4B is involved in the cancer development and progression to therapy resistance. To gain
mechanistic insight into its function, preliminary results revealed that ARID4B is recruited to the promoters of
ERα target genes that are far away from the identified ERα-bound enhancers. In addition, DHX9 was identified
as a novel ARID4B-interacting protein and is involved in ERα activation. DHX9 is an NTP-dependent helicase
capable of resolving transcription-coupled ‘R-loops’ that is inhibitory to productive transcription. Based on these
findings, our central hypothesis is that ARID4B activates ERα signaling to promote tumorigenesis and
endocrine therapy resistance by: (1) mediating promoter-enhancer looping via interaction with ERα and (2) by
recruiting DHX9 to resolve the transcription-coupled R-loops on promoters and enhancers to promote productive
transcription. In Aim 1, the in vivo function of ARID4B in tumor initiation, cancer growth, and endocrine therapy
resistance will be investigated using several breast cancer cells in tumor xenograft models, patient-derived
resistant tumors in PDX, and a newly generated ARID4B knock-in mouse model. In Aim 2, we will investigate
how ARID4B-mediated enhancer-promoter looping regulates ERα activation and identify the important functional
domain(s) on ARID4B to provide in-depth understanding of ARID4B-ERα and ARID4B-DHX9 interactions.
Furthermore, we will investigate whether resolution of “R-loops” on the promoter and enhancer by DHX9 is
required for the activation of ERα. Finally, we will demonstrate that targeting the ARID4B-DHX9 axis by
suppressing DHX9 expression or activity inhibits tumorigenesis and resistance to antiestrogens. Our study will
fill the crucial gap in understanding the function and mechanism underlying the emerging oncogenic activity of
ARID4B and establish ARID4B-DHX9 axis as a therapeutic target for breast cancer."
10886563,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that is closely related to dengue virus (DENV). Since its discovery in 1947, ZIKV remained relatively unnoticed, causing small, local outbreaks primarily in parts of Africa and Asia, and was associated with minor symptoms, such as mild fever. However, in the last decade, ZIKV started to spread geographically across the Pacific islands, eventually reaching South America, where it caused an explosive outbreak that started in Brazil in 2015 and rapidly spread to other South and Central American countries. This has been accompanied by a startling link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the development of birth defects among fetuses and babies, including microcephaly. It is unclear what factors may have led to the massive ZIKV outbreak or the severe disease manifestations in the Americas, but one potential variable is that much of the at-risk population in the Americas has preexisting immunity to DENV. It is well documented that preexisting immunity to one serotype of DENV can alter the disease pathogenesis of a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Because ZIKV outbreaks have occurred in regions around the world where DENV is endemic and due to the high degree of relatedness of ZIKV and DENV, it is critical to understand and characterize the extent to which prior infection with DENV exacerbates ZIKV disease. In this application, we will focus on how DENV antibodies impact ZIKV infection in the context of pregnancy by utilizing three model systems (immunocompromised Stat2-/- mice, immunocompetent humanized STAT2 knock-in mice, and human placental explants infected with ZIKV ex vivo)."

sexually transmitted infections) are greatest when circumcision is performed as a neonatal circumcision (NC)
under local anesthesia, rather than as an operative circumcision (OC) under general anesthesia later in life.
However, young boys for whom an infant circumcision was desired commonly present for elective OC after the
neonatal period. Previous research indicates that boys of lower socioeconomic status have more difficulty
accessing NC such that the increased risks and decreased health benefits of OC disproportionally affect boys
of lower socioeconomic status. Recent data show that changes in Medicaid coverage of NC disproportionately
affect Black/African American boys compared with boys of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Available data
indicate that both healthcare operational and insurance coverage factors contribute to the disparity in access to
NC. Chicago-Area clinician interviews have identified multiple operational barriers to NC, including clinical
logistical challenges and lack of standardized processes that compound substantial variation in NC
reimbursement that dis-incentivizes some birth hospitals from uniformly offering NC.
 The proposed study aims to address the operational barriers to providing NC to desirous families. The
World Health Organization’s evidence-based Standards and Procedures for high-quality, high-volume NC
programs will be used as a framework (developed for low- and middle-income countries) and adapted for
utilization in multiple clinical settings in the United States (US). The goals of this proposal are to (1) leverage
the WHO Standards and Procedures to develop and implement safe, efficient, and contextually-adapted NC
programs at 3 hospitals that promote equity of NC; (2) evaluate each NC program’s impact on patient
outcomes; and (3) provide a cost analysis of the NC program to support dissemination. A multidisciplinary
team (pediatrics, obstetrics, pediatric urology, health services research, health economics, and global health)
has been assembled to execute the study. Findings from this study will provide US birthing hospitals with
examples of safe, efficient, and contextually adaptable NC programs, based on the evidence-based WHO
Standards and Procedures. These examples will include cost analyses from both hospital and patient
perspectives to facilitate dissemination. Ultimately, by implementing NC programs that overcome both
structural and health system barriers, equity in NC should improve."
10886590,"This is a request for renewal of support for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine’s (UPSOM) training
program in Autoimmunity and Immunopathology (AI/IP), which currently funds 4 predoctoral and 4 postdoc-
toral trainees. AI/IP is a central basic and applied research area that is bringing the insights of basic immu-
nology to patients in the form of biological and mechanism-based therapies. Our AI/IP training program is thus
very clearly delineated from other (successful) training programs in immunology-related areas, such as in
infectious disease or transplantation, at Pitt. We have had success: while faithfully implementing our mentor-
ing plan, we have trained or are training 22 pre-doctoral students with 20 different mentors. Thirteen pre-
doctoral students have completed their PhD and two completed their MD/PhD degrees. These students have
published an average of 5.8 papers each, with an average of 2.5 first author papers. Three of our pre-doctoral
fellows are URM. Most are continuing in research-intensive careers, either as postdocs or in industry. We
have also trained or are training 21 post-doctoral fellows with 19 different mentors, including 15 PhDs, 3 MDs
and 3 MD/PhDs. Three of our post-doctoral fellows are URM. Our postdoctoral trainees have had success in
obtaining further funding in the form of Foundation fellowships and K awards. We have implemented a new
course, Autoimmunity and Immunopathology, along with our “Trainee Day” activities that provide bidirectional
feedback. We now propose to build meaningfully on what is now a proven and important training program.
We highlight two major enhancements: 1) Establishment of a new graduate program. The Program in Micro-
biology and Immunology (PMI) was created in 2017 to enhance focused Immunology and Microbiology edu-
cation and to strengthen the links between these related areas. The establishment of PMI has greatly in-
creased the quality and diversity of our applicant pool, while adding about 6 additional students/year. In addi-
tion, due to investment and recruitment our Immunology faculty has expanded, and our training faculty has
increased to 37 from 28. We have had increased high-quality competition for our predoctoral slots and are
thus requesting an additional pre-doctoral slot for this cycle; 2) Establishment of the Center for Systems Im-
munology. This Center has already recruited 3 new faculty including its director Dr. Harinder Singh, and will
provide cutting edge research and training in this key emerging field. Our program flourishes within a support-
ive and rich environment. UPSOM cares deeply about training and has implemented a series of effective
programs to ensure outstanding training at the student and postdoc levels. The pool of applicants is also
outstanding, given our successful PMI and MSTP programs, our highly sought-after clinical fellowships, and
the attractiveness of our mentor pool for fellows applying directly. We are excited to execute our training plan
for the upcoming cycle, and to capitalize on the significant improvements that we have made and have
planned both for training opportunities as well as in terms of faculty. We feel that the prospects are exceptional."
10886591,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than $17 billion dollars are spent per year on health care for children with neurologic impairment
(NI). The main driver of these high costs is aspiration pneumonias, which cause lengthy and repeated
hospitalizations, higher acuity hospitalizations, and significant mortality. The dogma has long been that these
pneumonias are caused by aspiration of refluxed acidic gastric contents and thus should be treated with acid
suppression and anti-reflux surgeries. However, these therapies not only have failed to reduce the
development of aspiration pneumonias, but also may hasten the development of lung disease by increasing
pneumonia risk by altering the aerodigestive microbiome, in the case of acid suppression, or by obstructing
esophageal outflow or delaying gastric motility, in the case of anti-reflux surgery. Esophageal and gastric
dysmotility are particularly concerning because they cause fluid stagnation with secondary changes in
chemical and microbial composition. If these altered esophageal and gastric contents are aspirated, lung
disease likely ensues. But questions remain: Which specific motility abnormalities result in fluid stasis and do
these abnormalities predispose children with NI to more frequent aspiration pneumonias? Which components
of static fluid portend worse clinical outcomes? Will correcting the dysmotility improve clinical outcomes?
 The proposed research will build on the current literature by addressing the following hypotheses: (1)
distinct esophageal and gastric motility patterns result in stasis of esophageal and gastric contents; (2) this
stasis alters the microbial and chemical milieu of esophageal and gastric fluids; (3) the stagnant gastric and
esophageal contents, when aspirated, cause measurable microbiome and inflammatory changes that
predispose patients to developing aspiration pneumonias; and (4) treatment of esophageal and gastric
dysmotility improves aspiration-related symptoms and results in measurable changes in esophageal and
gastric dysmotility. First, using a longitudinal cohort study design, the investigators will determine which unique
esophageal and gastric motility patterns cause stasis and predict the development of aspiration pneumonias in
children with NI. Second, using a randomized, blinded crossover design, investigators will test whether
prucalopride, a 5HT4 agonist, improves both aspiration-related symptoms and esophageal and gastric motility.
 This research will: 1) attack a common and costly problem, aspiration pneumonias, in a medically
vulnerable population; (2) move beyond GERD to pursue a novel, paradigm-shifting pathophysiologic
mechanism, dysmotility, underlying development of aspiration pneumonias; (3) progress beyond standard
testing to include not only motility parameters, but also the microbiome and chemical consequences of
dysmotility; and (4) offer an innovative therapeutic intervention for aspiration symptoms that may improve
health outcomes and reduce health care costs in a vulnerable population. Ultimately, this research can be
used to devise additional novel therapeutic motility interventions to treat extraesophageal symptoms."
10886937,"Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), independent of
genetic risk. Despite this knowledge, little is known about whether and how chronic experiences of racism
contribute to medial temporal hippocampal (MTH) and prefrontal-executive system integrity, systems that
exhibit profound neurodegeneration in AD and vulnerability to chronic stress. Although comorbid illnesses and
socioeconomic status contribute to the AD health disparity, disparities remain. This highlights a critical unmet
need for understanding social and societal stressors to disparities in brain health. A major contributor to health
inequities in the U.S. is chronic stress due to the cumulative effects of racism over the lifetime. The impact of
chronic interpersonal and institutional/structural racism, unique and salient forms of chronic stress in Black
Americans, on the neurocognitive integrity of these brain systems is not well understood. Since perceived
racism contributes to health disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which are also risk factors
for AD, perceived racism should have a significant impact also on the AD health disparity. The objective of the
parent R01 grant is to investigate the impact of racism on 1) CVD risk and 2) neurocognitive MTH-memory and
prefrontal-executive system integrity in Black seniors and to examine potentially underlying biological
mechanisms. The research objective of this diversity supplement is to examine the impact of consequences of
structural racism on neurocognitive integrity, namely 1) acculturation, a social compensatory mechanism
defined as the incorporation of the cultural norms of the social majority within a society, and 2) lower education
quality, leading to poorer dementia-related health literacy and greater public stigma associated with AD. The
central hypothesis of the parent R01 grant is that cognitively healthy Black seniors who have experienced
higher levels of chronic racism will show greater CVD risk and poorer MTH and prefrontal integrity than those
who have experienced fewer instances of racism over their lifetime. CVD risk and mental health may mediate
(i.e., explain) the relationship between racism burden and neurocognitive integrity. This diversity supplement
extends the parent grant by examining the relationships between AD-related health literacy, and public stigma
associated with AD with cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes (Aim 1) and acculturation (Aim 2) with cognitive
and neuroimaging outcomes. Aim 3 is exploratory and will examine racism burden and public stigma as
moderators of the relationship between acculturation and neurocognitive outcomes. The proposed diversity
supplement is for the candidate to gain expertise in how proxies of anti-Black structural racism affect brain
health in older Black self-identifying adults. To achieve these goals, in addition to the research aims outlined
above, the candidate is proposing training in multimodal neuroimaging (i.e., structural and fMRI) and statistical
modeling, and advancing mastery of MTH- and prefrontal-dependent functions related to anti-Black
racism. This supplement will set up the candidate for success in independent neurocognitive aging research."
10884628,"The highly exciting results from the recent clinical trial of Lecanemab for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reignite
tremendous enthusiasm for AD drug development. Lecanemab is the first drug to meet all the clinical endpoints
without controversy over the past decades. However, compared to other diseases like cancer, the progress in
AD drug development, both in clinical and preclinical stages, lags behind. The number of AD therapeutics under
preclinical discovery is unquestionably dwarfed by the number of cancer drugs at similar stages. Several high-
throughput imaging methods, such as bioluminescence imaging, have significantly accelerated drug discovery
for cancer research. However, such a high-throughput imaging method is not readily available for AD drug
discovery. In this proposal, we plan to develop “smart” (turn-on) chemiluminescence probes that can enable
high-throughput imaging for preclinical AD research.
 “Smart” (turn-on) fluorescence imaging has been routinely used for in vitro, cellular, and in vivo imaging. In
contrast, the exploration of smart chemiluminescence imaging has been limited due to its low sensitivity and
dependence on reactive oxygen species (ROS) or enzyme activity. To address these challenges, we have
developed a novel chemiluminescence probe called ADLumin-1. Through extensive validation, we have
confirmed that ADLumin-1 exhibits turn-on chemiluminescence upon interaction with amyloid beta (Aβ) species,
resulting in a remarkable 216-fold increase in intensity in vitro. Notably, ADLumin-1 does not rely on ROS or
enzyme activity, distinguishing it from other chemiluminescence probes. In vivo two-photon imaging indicated
that ADLumin-1 was highly specific for Ab deposits. In vivo whole-brain imaging showed that ADLumin-1
provided a 1.80-fold higher signal from 5-month-old transgenic AD (5xFAD) mice than that from the age-matched
wild-type mice. Our recent study has further shown that ADLumin-1 enables high-throughput chemiluminescence
imaging, as evidenced by imaging 30 mice within 30 minutes with a $100 imaging fee in a longitudinal therapeutic
study. Additionally, our preliminary results have showcased the feasibility of optical 3D brain imaging using our
chemiluminescence probe, opening up incredible possibilities for future AD research.
 This proposal aims to advance the development of ADLumin-X probes through in vitro and in vivo validation,
with the ultimate objective of employing the most effective probe for high-throughput monitoring of therapeutic
interventions in experimental AD drug studies. Our overarching goal is to offer accessible, highly sensitive, and
cost-effective “PET-like” optical imaging methods for expediting preclinical AD drug development."

Malaria continues to have a huge toll on morbidity and mortality in the world, responsible for over
600,000 deaths annually. The transmission stages are bottlenecks for the parasite and thus critical
stages for intervention, particularly when aiming for elimination. Using the rodent model
Plasmodium yoelli, we recently found that salivary gland sporozoite load of a biting mosquito
strongly correlates with infection likelihood, with highly infected mosquitoes being 7.5 times more
likely to initiate an infection. Importantly, the likelihood of achieving secondary infections rapidly
rises at salivary gland sporozoite densities >10,000 that represent a small proportion of field-
caught mosquitoes. These data challenge the assumption that all infected mosquitoes are
equal, a belief that underlies epidemiological models of transmission and impacts malaria
elimination strategies. In this proposal we will determine the mechanisms underlying the
increased infectious potential of highly infected mosquitoes, comparing the quantity of sporozoites
inoculated by mosquitoes harboring high and low numbers of sporozoites, as well as the quality of
sporozoites in these two groups. In Aim 1 we will determine the inocula associated with low- and
high-infected mosquitoes using both rodent malaria parasites and the human parasite P.
falciparum. In Aim 2, we will compare sporozoites from mosquitoes with low and high infections
using infection assays, intravital imaging, and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. Overall these
experiments will fill crucial knowledge gaps on parasite transmission probability that will greatly
improve our understanding of parasite biology and epidemiology."

Epidemiological studies have shown that temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) pain and migraine headache are
closely associated. Specifically, migraine headache appears to be more prevalent in women with myogenic TMD.
However, the molecular mechanisms for TMD pain and its comorbidity with migraine as well as their sex
differences remain poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to identify potential targets for developing a novel
therapy for TMD and migraine overlapping pain. In our preliminary studies, we have developed an animal model
to study TMD pain and its comorbidity with migraine by combining masseter muscle tendon ligation (MMTL)-
produced myogenic TMD with systemic injection of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine-like pain, and this work
has been published recently. Using RNA sequencing followed by qPCR confirmation, we identified trigeminal
dynorphin as a potential female-specific therapeutic target for this overlapping pain condition. We observed for
the first time that blockade of dynorphin in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) of female mice
significantly inhibits myogenic TMD pain and diminishes TMD-enhanced migraine-like pain, and that Sp5C
injection of dynorphin enables a non-sensitizing dose of NTG to produce persistent migraine-like pain in female
mice, but not male mice. We further found that Sp5C antagonism of bradykinin receptor, but not kappa opioid
receptor, inhibits such overlapping pain in female mice. Moreover, bradykinin receptor B2 (BKRB2), but not
BKRB1, is expressed in the Sp5C, and MMTL plus NTG treatment decreases the binding of BKRB2 with neuronal
nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and increases NOS activity in the Sp5C, which will increase nitric oxide production
and then promote migraine pain development. These results suggest that Sp5C dynorphin could play a female-
specific role in TMD pain and its comorbidity with migraine through a non-opioid receptor mechanism. In this
project, we will determine the central mechanisms by which trigeminal dynorphin contributes to TMD and
migraine overlapping pain condition. Our hypothesis is that trigeminal dynorphin enhances TMD and migraine
comorbidity in female mice by activating bradykinin receptor BKRB2 and then inhibiting its binding with nNOS to
increase nitric oxide production in the Sp5C, thereby promoting TMD and migraine overlapping pain. To test this
central hypothesis, we will use multidisciplinary approaches to characterize female-specific role of trigeminal
dynorphin in TMD and migraine overlapping pain (Aim 1), determine the receptor mechanism for dynorphin in
trigeminal pain regulation (Aim 2), and define the downstream pathway of dynorphin signaling in trigeminal
nociceptive system (Aim 3). Collectively, we expect to reveal the central mechanisms by which trigeminal
dynorphin specifically contributes to TMD and migraine comorbidity in females. The proposed research is
significant since it will advance our understanding of TMD pain and its comorbidity. The proposed studies are
innovative since these studies will identify a previously unrecognized female-specific role for dynorphin in
trigeminal overlapping pain condition."
10888762,"ABSTRACT
 Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in ano-genital and head and neck cancers and are
responsible for around 5% of cancers worldwide. In order to identify and develop novel approaches for targeting
these viral diseases, we must enhance our understanding of the viral life cycle.
 HPV16 is the most common type that causes cancer (high-risk, HR-HPV). During its life cycle, the virus
exists as an 8kbp DNA plasmid. A viral protein that mediates viral replication is E2, a DNA binding protein that
forms homodimers that bind to 12bp palindromic DNA target sequences. E2 has three functions during the viral
life cycle: first, it binds to target DNA sites around the viral origin of replication and recruits the viral helicase E1
to the origin. E1 then forms a di-hexameric complex that initiates viral replication in association with host cellular
factors. Second, E2 mediates segregation of the episomal viral genome into daughter nuclei during cell division
by simultaneously interacting with viral and host chromatin acting as a bridge to locate the viral genomes to
daughter nuclei. Third, E2 can regulate viral and host transcription. The focus of this proposal is on how E2
regulates transcription from the host genome to facilitate the viral life cycle.
 Using RNA-seq data from isogenic N/Tert-1-Vec (Vector control), N/Tert-1+E2 (expressing the E2 protein
only) and N/Tert-1+HPV16 (containing the episomal viral genome, this model demonstrates several aspects of
the HPV16 life cycle in organotypic raft cultures) we demonstrated that E2 regulates host transcription that is
important during the viral life cycle. This proposal will focus on E2 repression of innate immune gene transcription
(IIG) and suppression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) via repression of TWIST1.
 The repression of IIGs is via DNA methylation and here we demonstrate that E2 is in a cellular complex
with DNMT1, providing a potential mechanism (E2 recruitment of DNMT1 to IIG promoters) for E2 repression.
E2 represses TWIST1 via a direct interaction with the TWIST1 promoter; DNA methylation is not involved. The
TWIST1 promoter is activated by STAT3 and here we demonstrate that E2 interacts with STAT3, providing a
potential mechanism of how E2 is repressing TWIST1. In this proposal, we will investigate the repression of IIG
IFIT1. The IFIT1 protein can bind to and disrupt HPV18 E1-E2 replication, and we have demonstrated that it
binds to HPV16 E1, and preliminary studies demonstrate it can attenuate E1-E2 replication. Using novel CRISPR
technology we have increased the levels of IFIT1 in a host of HPV16 and E2 positive cells. We will investigate
whether elevated TWIST1 interferes with the HPV16 life cycle. We will carry out similar experiments with
TWIST1. Recently we demonstrated that E2 sensitizes cells to cisplatin, an important process that could
contribute to the better outcomes for E2 expressing HPV+ cancer patients. We will investigate the roles of IIGs
and TWIST1 in this process. Overall, our results will advance our understanding of how E2 regulates host
transcription, and provide potential novel therapeutic approaches for combatting HPV16 infections and cancers."

 The mechanism whereby RNA-binding proteins impact muscle function and disease progression is still
largely unknown. Fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1), an RNA-binding protein, is multi-functional and plays a role
in regulating the temporal and spatial expression of RNAs in myocytes. It is becoming increasingly evident that
FXR1 is essential for normal muscle function and is associated with both human cardiac and skeletal myopathies.
Although global knockout of Fxr1 in mice results in perinatal lethality with cardiac and skeletal muscle defects,
little is known regarding the fundamental mechanistic role(s) of FXR1. We discovered that FXR1 interacts with,
and post-transcriptionally regulates, mRNAs that encode proteins essential for excitation-contraction coupling,
including components that regulate phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC). We also identified
an interaction between FXR1 and the mRNA that encodes utrophin, a protein that can functionally substitute for
the loss of dystrophin in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Our extensive preliminary data, and data from others,
reveal that FXR1 protein levels are significantly reduced in human DMD myocytes as well as in all DMD models
tested including those from canine, pig, mouse and rat. Remarkably, restoring FXR1 levels in three different
mouse models of DMD attenuates disease progression, resulting in structural and functional improvements in
both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Utrophin expression is also enhanced in DMD mice in response to increased
FXR1 levels. Thus, we hypothesize that FXR1 specifically regulates cellular components that are critical for
proper muscle function and alterations in FXR1 levels/function contribute to disease progression, particularly in
DMD. We propose a global, unbiased and multidisciplinary approach from single molecule to in vivo studies,
including the use of human tissue, to allow us to accomplish three Specific Aims focused on determining the
basic physiological function of a Fragile X protein and the role it plays in muscle pathogenesis. In addition, we
will be among the first groups to assess gene-therapy strategies to prevent muscle dysfunction in DMD-rats (a
model which closely resembles human DMD). We predict these discoveries will facilitate a unique RNA-level
therapeutic approach to ameliorate muscle disease progression."
10896339,"Cognitive decline majorly affects quality of life in the general aging population; this is further exacerbated by an
increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. The general age-related cognitive decline is thought to be
mainly due to impaired synaptic function, not loss of neurons. Similarly, while neurodegenerative diseases do
involve loss of neurons, there is also significantly impaired synaptic function in the surviving neurons, For
instance, amyloid β oligomers (Aβ) are major pathological agents in as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cause
acute impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, even at time
points and concentrations insufficient to induce any significant neuronal cell death. Here we will test our
hypotheses that the LTP impairments related to normal aging versus AD (i) both involve mis-regulation of the
Ca2+/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but (ii) by fundamentally different mechanisms to
(iii) result in the distinct forms of LTP impairment in normal aging versus AD. Specifically, we hypothesize that
CaMKII hypo-nitrosylation directly causes the impairments in aging, but not the Aβ-induced impairments
(which may instead even involve hyper-nitrosylation). Additionally, we hypothesize that hypo-nitrosylation
reduces LTP by chronic long-term effects on synapse composition (including CaMKII itself), while the Aβ effects
instead involve acute mis-regulation of CaMKII.
 LTP is well-known to require CaMKII and its Ca2+-independent “autonomous” activity that is generated by
autophosphorylation of T286. Additionally, two alternative ways to generate autonomous activity have been
described by my lab: Binding to the NMDA-receptor subunit GluN2B and S-nitrosylation of C280+C289. Indeed,
CaMKII binding to GluN2B is also required for normal LTP and for the CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses
during LTP. The functions of CaMKII nitrosylation in LTP and other forms of synaptic plasticity will be elucidated
here. Intriguingly, previous studies have shown that aging is accompanied by hypo-nitrosylation of neuronal
proteins, including CaMKII, in both mice and humans. Additionally, preliminary studies indicated that
nitrosylation causes CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses, and that this requires regulated CaMKII binding
to GluN2B. i.e. the same mechanism that is required for the LTP-induced CaMKII movement.
 In three related but independent aims, our proposal will determine the specific involvement of CaMKII
nitrosylation in the LTP impairments related to normal aging versus AD (with the expectation for fundamentally
distinct CaMKII mis-regulation). First, we will determine the regulatory mechanisms for synaptic CaMKII
localization by nitrosylation. Then, we will determine the functions of CaMKII nitrosylation in the distinct
impairment of LTP related to normal aging versus AD. Finally, we will determine the effects of CaMKII
nitrosylation on learning and memory function in behavioral tasks."

The ability to manipulate the expression of genes in cells and organisms is foundational to the
study of genetics. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing toolkit has revolutionized our ability to
modify the genome and epigenome precisely. While CRISPR tools have been optimized to allow
for robust, tunable, and predictable repression and inactivation of gene expression, approaches
to induce gene expression (CRISPR activation, or CRISPRa) are less robust and reproducible.
Through a combination of innovative high-throughput screens and cutting-edge computational
modeling, we will develop a cohort of simple, robust, tunable, and predictable CRISPR-based
tools to increase the expression of any mouse or human gene.
We have developed a high-throughput sequencing-based assay system, Self-sustaining Peptide
Activator Reporter-seq (SPARq), which enables quantitative screening of thousands of candidate
gene activating peptides and combinations thereof to monitor and optimize their gene activation
strength. In Aim 1, we will iteratively employ SPARq to systematically evaluate and optimize
multiple features of gene activating peptides, including activation peptide identity, combination,
linker, and CRISPRa method. We will perform SPARq screens in distinct cell types and with
distinct promoter architectures to identify tools that work consistently, designing a set of CRISPRa
tools that are significantly more potent and consistent than the current state-of-the-art.
In Aim 2, we will improve the predictability and consequently the utility of CRISPRa through a
novel high-throughput reporter assay and a computational effort to model the features associated
with CRISPRa potency. We have designed an approach, CRISPR Outcome and Phenotype
screening, that combines a sensitive reporter assay with a native genomic phenotypic
measurement to profile the activity of a CRISPRa tool at thousands of target sites. Using data
collected through this pipeline, we will develop an algorithm that takes as input one of the
CRISPRa tools developed in Aim 1, a cell type, gene, and CRISPR guide RNA and outputs an
accurate estimate of the expression of that gene following CRISPRa treatment. We will validate
the accuracy of this algorithm to enable tunable gene activation over an extensive dynamic range
in human HepG2 and K562 cells, providing it to the genetics community as a webtool.
Altogether, the efforts described in this proposal will pioneer a next generation toolkit to enable
more robust gain-of-function genetic manipulation and screening."

An individual can progress from ideal lung health, to an intermediate phenotype of impaired lung health, to
chronic respiratory disease, yet this transition is poorly understood. A consequence of this knowledge gap is the
lack of robust strategies to prevent chronic lung disease. The Lung Health Cohort (LHC) study (NHLBI
5U01HL146408) will recruit healthy participants across the US to have their lung health evaluated through
questionnaires, biospecimen analysis, spirometry, and computerized tomography (CT), and relate these features
to an array of anthropomorphic and environmental factors thought to influence lung health. In this Ancillary study
application, we propose to extend the phenotyping of the LHC to include detailed measures of lung
structure and function to obtain a more robust understanding of the influence of modifiable exposures
and risk factors on lung health. We postulate that a key aspect of both current and future lung health is
“dysanapsis”, which is thought to occur when dyssynchronous growth of airways and lung parenchyma such that
the airways are small relative to lung size. Dysanapsis has been associated in children with obesity, airways
hyperresponsiveness and asthma, and in adults, with COPD; however, a comprehensive characterization and
validation of dysanapsis by both more specific functional and structural measures has not been assessed in
healthy young adults nor shown to be a longitudinal risk factor. Our timely and innovative approach will combine
structural information by CT with functional, state-of the-art assessment of spirometry, lung volumes, and
oscillometry and gas exchange. We hypothesize that modifiable exposures and risk factors influence lung
health by their effects on structural and functional dysanapsis of the airway, parenchyma and pulmonary
vasculature and gas exchange. In particular, we will assess the associations of modifiable environmental
factors such as tobacco, air pollution, marijuana and electronic cigarettes, in addition to age, sex, ethnicity, BMI,
prematurity, allergic rhinitis, and history of COVID-19, as these factors relate to airway and vascular dysanapsis,
cardiac morphology and gas exchange. The plausible mechanistic hypothesis that underlies the proposal is that
there is mismatching of airways and blood vessels to parenchyma both in terms of structure (CT) and function
(PFTs); we posit that this dysanapsis is a silent marker of early and progressive lung disease. This ancillary
study will leverage the infrastructure and endpoints of the parent LHC study, as we will extend the LHC
investigation in a number of significant ways to fill knowledge gaps that determine both the reserve and
susceptibility of the lung to disease. This “deep phenotyping” of the baseline lung function and cardiac and
pulmonary vascular structure will provide a more detailed understanding of the influence of modifiable exposures
and risk factors of both current and future lung disease."

IgE-mediated food allergy affects approximately 1 in 13 children in the USA and has continued to grow in
prevalence in recent decades. For many, current immunotherapies are ineffective, making this is a lifelong
disease with significant impairment in quality of life. Although IgE is central to the pathophysiology of food
allergy, the mechanisms maintaining high affinity (pathogenic) IgE are not well understood. Previous work
from our laboratory has shown that IgE memory in mice is contained within a population of antigen-specific
IgG memory B cells (MBC) that can undergo class switching to IgE. However, strategies targeting a broad
subset of IgG-expressing cells for treatment of food allergy is complicated by the need to retain protective
immunity against pathogens. Therefore, it is important to identify the specific IgG MBC that have the ability
to generate high affinity IgE responses. This proposal seeks to use mouse models of peanut allergy to
identify immunophenotypic markers that can distinguish IgG MBC subsets with the ability to produce high
affinity IgE plasma cells (PC). In addition, this application will address the plasticity of this cell fate and the
external signals that are required for IgG MBC differentiation into IgE PC. Ultimately, we want to
understand what it takes for an IgG MBC to become a pathogenic-IgE producing plasma cell and reveal
targets that could be amenable to therapeutic intervention to improve the quality of life of patients who
suffer from food allergies."

Physician-scientists play a unique role in bridging the gap between basic science and clinicians
through the identification of important clinical questions and translating results to improve patient
care. Unfortunately, the physician-scientist workforce continues to diminish and contributes to
negative, long-lasting consequences in biomedical research. Many residency programs focus
heavily on acquiring medical knowledge as opposed to fostering intellectual curiosity and an
introduction into the biomedical research field. In this proposal, we aim to enhance attractiveness
and preparedness for a career as a physician-scientist during residency training. Furthering the
diminishing interest in a career as a physician-scientist is the ability to identify an encouraging
and successful mentor. There is a critical need for a renewed emphasis on established physician-
scientists as role models to trainees. Infectious Disease and Immunology are fundamental areas
of science that greatly benefits from a robust physician-scientist workforce. Massachusetts
General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, particularly in the Departments of Medicine and
Surgery, has a long track record of training physician-scientists. We hypothesize that early and
longitudinal mentorship combined with development of research and professional development
skills in the areas of Infectious Diseases and Immunology will make the physician-scientist career
path attractive and sustainable. To this end, we propose the implementation of the MGH-Next
Generation Physician-Scientist Training Pathways (MGH-Next Gen PSTP) program in
Immunology and Infectious Disease. The MGH-Next Gen PSTP program is centered around
the following objectives:
Objective 1: Foster the creation of important scientific contributions through strong,
longitudinal mentorship with an emphasis on leadership essentials.
Objective 2: Develop sufficient basic laboratory and epidemiology approaches necessary
to conduct high-quality research in the areas of immunology and infectious diseases.
Objective 3: Formulate hypothesis-based research questions, development and execution
of a research project, and effectively communicate the significance of their science.
Together, these initiatives are designed to attract, train, and retain MDs in biomedical
investigation at the most critical juncture of their career - residency training."

prokaryotes to humans. Despite this, DNA is frequently damaged. In fact, estimates suggest that each human
cell may experience as many as ~105 lesions per day. To protect their genomes, organisms have therefore
evolved a sophisticated set of mechanisms that sense, signal, and repair chemically diverse forms of DNA
damage and, when damage cannot be repaired, induce programs of cell death. Decades of work have provided
an extensive ‘parts list’ of these mechanisms in human cells. However, a major challenge to our understanding
remains: We do not know how these mechanisms work together at the systems level to ensure response
flexibility across conditions or enable compensation when one mechanism fails. This lack of systematic
knowledge is problematic. It limits our comprehension of human diseases, such as cancers with DNA repair
deficiencies, and it challenges our ability to develop and improve medical therapies that exploit response
activities. We have recently developed functional genomics approaches that enable systematic interrogation of
gene function in human cells, and with these tools, we propose to address this gap in knowledge. The
fundamental logic behind our approaches is simple. We pair CRISPR-based genetic perturbation techniques
with scalable methods for obtaining high-content phenotypes, such as single-cell RNA-sequencing. This allows
us to collect data rich readouts of cell behavior across cells in which we have perturbed the function of many
genes. With such data, we can infer functional relationships between genes and delineate genetic pathways.
Here, I propose to use two of these technologies to map DNA damage response mechanisms in human cells,
with the goals of improving genome editing technologies (Project 1) and achieving deeper understanding of drug
responses during cancer therapy (Project 2). To enable the first project, we demonstrate a new approach that
pairs CRISPR-based genetic screens with deep sequencing of DNA repair junctions to generate high-content
readouts of DNA repair. We establish this approach using Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes and propose work
that will serve as a roadmap for understanding genome editing technologies in the future."

Determination of a protein’s three-dimensional structure is of critical importance in biology,
providing insights to biological mechanisms and important targets for drug design. While high-
resolution X-ray diffraction data provides an atomic view of cellular components, for many
interesting and biologically relevant complexes, it may only be possible to obtain low-resolution
structural information. In recent years, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful method to gain structural insights into these large molecular machines. However, for
many complexes of interest, data is often: a) extremely limited in resolution, lacking atomic
details, and b) highly heterogeneous in terms of data quality. Both effects are due to the
inherent flexibility of many of these complexes. Extracting detailed atomic information from this
data, critical in understanding function, the effects of mutation, or in designing drugs is
impossible due to the low number of observations and the large conformational space proteins
may adopt. We propose a suite of computational methods for inferring high-accuracy atomic
models from this low-resolution data, revealing detailed structural insights into these complexes.
In the previous granting period, we: a) developed a set of tools for accurately building and
refining protein models into low-resolution experimental cryoEM maps, b) released these tools
as freely available software and gave tutorials to enable cryo-electron microscopists to use
these methods, and c) closely collaborated with dozens of microscopists to develop custom
methodology for their particular systems of interest. In this proposal, we further these methods
in several distinct directions. We develop methodology for accurately identifying ligands and
accurately modelling ligand conformations in low-resolution datasets. We build off of machine-
learning-guided protein structure prediction, and develop methods to more rapidly and robustly
interpret low-resolution cryo-EM datasets. We feel these methods should be fast enough to be
suitable for use in an on-line data processing pipeline. Finally, we develop methodology to
untangle structural heterogeneity by building a heterogeneous set of protein models that best
explains variations in single-particle images, providing structural insights into the conformational
heterogeneity of single-particle data.
The overall goal of the proposed research is robust and accessible methods to interpret – to the
level of atomic accuracy – low-resolution and heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. Combined, the
three aims in this proposal will lead to dramatic improvements in our ability to infer atomic
interactions from such datasets. As microscopists continue tackling more complicated protein
complexes, these methods will be needed to reveal atom-level insights into how biomedically
important protein complexes perform their function and what goes wrong in human disease."

The discovery of new small molecules that perturb the function of membrane receptors, like G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC), remains critically important to the study and
improvement of human health. Natural products are particularly well-suited for this task, as their structural
complexity and unique mechanism of action make them superior chemical probes and excellent starting points
for drug discovery. The Riley lab is focused on developing step-economic synthetic routes and robust isolation
protocols to access these complex natural product scaffolds. Through modular total syntheses, semi-synthetic
methods, and contemporary receptor assays, we transform natural products into highly potent and selective tools
for studying membrane receptors. This application describes an overview of our work and future directions in
applying these strategies to investigate the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the kappa opioid
receptor (κOR) as representative LGIC and GPCR, respectively. The first research area builds upon our work
that recently identified members of the Aristotelia alkaloid family as potent inhibitors of the nAChRs, a major
class of LGICs, with an unusual yet desirable subtype-selectivity. During this award, we will develop streamlined
synthetic chemistry to access the entire class of Aristotelia alkaloids and generate large libraries of their
derivatives. By coupling these synthetic chemistry efforts with an expanded ability to screen for activity against
an array of nAChR subtypes and other membrane receptors, this work will deliver new chemical tools to probe
the biological function of specific nAChR subtypes. In the second research area, we will explore a novel class of
κOR agonists derived from the indole alkaloid akuammicine that were recently discovered in our laboratory. Our
initial studies identified these akuammicine derivatives are potent biased agonist that preferentially activate the
G-protein signaling pathway. Leveraging isolation protocols that provide synthetically useful quantities of
complex alkaloids directly from their natural sources, we will employ late-state diversification techniques to
rapidly generate novel derivatives that probe ligand-receptor interactions within the κOR and monitor their ability
to initiate opioid signaling cascades. We expect the results from this research will reach beyond the nAChR and
κOR and can be applied to other therapeutically relevant LGICs and GPCRs, thereby having a significant impact
on drug discovery by revealing new directions to rationally design ligands for these important membrane
receptors."

The goal of this application is to secure funding for the 2024 FASEB summer research conference (SRC) on
“Immunoreceptors and Immunotherapy”. This successful SRC has been running since 1987 and has fostered a
highly interactive community of international researchers with the goal of solving important problems in
immunoreceptor and immunotherapy biology. Immunoreceptors play a central role in cancer, autoimmunity and
infectious diseases, whilst immunotherapy is the rapidly expanding field focused on stimulating the immune
system to fight cancer and other inflammatory diseases to change people’s lives in the clinic. The meeting
program is composed of the best science related to immune receptor function, immune cell signaling, and the
physiology and pathology of immune diseases. We also highlight emerging topics including inhibitory receptors
and antibody engineering, along with immunotherapy in cancer and autoimmunity, and the new topic
organization of immunoreceptors on the membrane. Our speakers represent leaders in the field as well as early-
and mid-career investigators. The speakers have been selected to feature cutting-edge aspects of
immunoreceptor and immunotherapy biology, covering the range from basic science to translational applications.
The program also includes state-of-the-art technologies in imaging, structural analysis, computational modeling,
systems biology and therapeutic approaches. As such, this meeting brings together scientists from different
fields, creating a dynamic and interdisciplinary environment for building networks and developing new
collaborations. The FASEB SRC provides an ideal format for this meeting, because interactions between
participants is guaranteed by the size of the meeting, multiple poster sessions and shared meals. This R13 will
be exclusively used to financially support trainees and young investigators to attend and present at the
conference. This meeting is committed to sustain diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI) in science
through a diverse selection of speakers, use of travel awards to enable underrepresented researchers’
attendance and introduction of a new DEAI roundtable discussion. Other networking opportunities, including a
“meet the expert” luncheon and Career Workshop will further help to foster connections between young
investigators and senior researchers. With this SRC program, we aim to encourage intensive scientific discussion
that promotes new collaborations among the international community engaged in immunobiology research."

The biennial Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Musculoskeletal Biology and Bioengineering has been
the leading forum for the presentation and discussion of emerging paradigms in the field since the meeting was
established in 1980. The impact of this meeting was further enhanced in 2014 with the addition of a Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS), which is focused on and led by trainees and early career investigators. Both the
GRC and GRS promote presentation of unpublished data and prioritize formal and informal discussion time,
and the program is developed in a way that facilitates participation and support of a diverse array of new
investigators in the musculoskeletal field. Participation is capped at 200 to further enhance networking and
discussion. In the current application, funds are requested for partial support of the 2024 Gordon Research
Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Musculoskeletal (MSK) Biology and Bioengineering at Proctor
Academy in Andover, NH. This venue provides an ideal environment for focused discussion of cutting-edge
science and informal interactions during leisure and social activities each day. The theme for the 2024 GRC is
“Multidisciplinary Approaches to Tackling Musculoskeletal Problems Across the Lifespan”, with the goal
of facilitating retention or restoration of MSK health through the lifespan. The GRC program, which consists of
nine plenary sessions, will integrate biological, engineering, and clinical approaches in development, aging,
and disease in the musculoskeletal system. In addition, short talks and poster presentations from early stage
investigators provide an important platform the next generation of MSK researchers. Areas of emphasis will
focus on challenges to health equity in MSK research, emerging concepts in pain research, and strategies to
retain or restore MSK function through the lifespan, while the Power Hour will identify strategies and
approaches to make the conduct of MSK research (e.g., laboratory environments) more equitable. The two-day
GRS program, themed “Integrating Diverse and Multidisciplinary Approaches to Enhance
Musculoskeletal Health”, will immediately precede and integrate with the GRC program. GRS attendance is
expected to be 50 individuals, with all of these participants also attending the GRC. The GRS co-Chairs have
worked closely with the Chair and Vice-Chairs of the GRC to develop the scientific program, which includes a
mentoring component focused on building effective and sustainable career trajectories. In addition to the
keynote session and a career panel of established investigators, the GRS features research of new
investigators in two oral sessions and two poster sessions. Ensuring that this meeting facilitates inclusion and
leadership from women, minorities and persons with disabilities is a central goal of this GRS/GRC. As such, we
have crafted the program to center these voices, and our provisional program exceeds the diversity of both
prior MSK GRCs as well as the overall average of all GRCs."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important health problem associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Unraveling the mechanisms associated with risk of or protection from CKD will significantly advance a precision-
medicine approach to CKD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
The Minnesota-KPMP (Minn-KPMP) will ethically and safely obtain research kidney biopsies, biosamples, and
data from well phenotyped participants with CKD due to diabetes or hypertension and from patients with no
clinical manifestations of CKD despite decades of type 1 diabetes (T1D). In a highly diverse metropolitan area
actively confronting racism and disparities, Minn-KPMP will engage a diverse patient population to evaluate and
address barriers to enrollment in KPMP and to elicit the perspectives of our local participants on ethical issues
posed by the KPMP, such as return of results and biobank governance. This will add significantly to KPMP
community engagement and ethics.
Leveraging the Biomedical Informatics and Data Access service of the University of Minnesota Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Best Practices Integrated Informatics Core (BPIC), we will interrogate the
large MHealth Fairview (MHealth) database to identify, recruit, enroll, and obtain clinical data, biosamples, and
kidney biopsies from patients with CKD-Diabetes and CKD-Hypertension and resilient-T1D. We will work closely
with KPMP and help to refine and follow common study protocols while following maximum safety precautions.
The long-standing successful track record of our group in recruiting patients into clinical trials of CKD, and our
ethically rigorous approach to consenting for kidney biopsy and strict adherence to KPMP safety measures will
ensure our meaningful contribution to the KPMP mission and goals.
Minn-KPMP has assembled an outstanding team of investigators and consultants to recruit and follow
participants with CKD and with resilient T1D (Res-T1D). Directly relevant to this application, the Minn-KPMP
study team has a long-standing track record of successfully recruiting, following-up, and safely and ethically
performing research kidney biopsies, including sequential kidney biopsies, in a wide range of participants,
including participants with diabetes and with no clinical manifestations of CKD, siblings with diabetes, kidney
donors, kidney transplant recipients, and pancreas transplant recipients. Obtaining high quality biosamples,
including kidney biopsy samples, from well phenotyped study participants is key to KPMP success, so that these
tissues can be used for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. The Minn-KPMP is eager and
fully prepared to collaborate with the other KPMP recruiting sites, tissue interrogation sites, central hub, steering
committee, DSMB, external expert panel, and the almost 300 members of the KPMP."

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide with an even greater burden of major disability. It
occurs at all ages with the greatest incidence in the elderly. The number of strokes is expected to rise in the US
and worldwide as the population ages. In 2013, NINDS established NIH StrokeNet to harness the leadership
and experience of the stroke research field to efficiently create and complete high-quality, multi-site trials and
related biomarker validation and ancillary studies spanning prevention, treatment, and recovery. Since
inception, the National Clinical Coordinating Center (NCC) at the University of Cincinnati has provided overall
leadership and has coordinated activities within NIH StrokeNet. Our central objective is to engage the broader
stroke community to successfully and efficiently design trials that are scientifically important, innovative, and
feasible; to start trials expeditiously after being funded by NINDS; to successfully recruit and retain
representative participants of the US population, and to maintain a pipeline of new clinical trialists by guiding
the training, education, and career development of StrokeNet’s fellows and clinical research professionals. In
addition to providing overall leadership and coordination for 24-27 regional coordinating centers affiliated with
500+ potential study sites, the NCC includes the StrokeNet research pharmacy and imaging activities.
Our NCC team consists of two MPIs with over 50 years of collective experience designing, implementing, and

10893339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polyamine biosynthesis in human cancer cells is a long-standing therapeutic target. Accumulating evidence
suggests that polyamine production by gut microbes contributes to the progression of colon and pancreatic
cancer. Biosynthesis of the polyamine spermidine by gut bacteria follows a pathway distinct from the human
pathway making this bacterial pathway a unique drug target. The two central enzymes in this pathway,
carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase and carboxyspermidine decarboxylase, have received only limited
characterization. We propose to solve the first structure of a carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase and to
development kinetic and structural models describing the function of both carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase
and carboxyspermidine decarboxylase in major gut constituents from the Bacteroides and Clostridium genera.
These aims serve as a necessary precursor to a future program of mechanism-guided drug design. The long-
term goal of this work is to open new avenues for the treatment of colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Interestingly,
the genes of predicted polyamine biosynthetic enzymes from many gut genera appear to encode redundant
paths toward the production of spermidine. We hypothesize that these paths are not redundant, but generate
unique polyamine products. We propose the use of LC-TQ-MS assays to delineate the polyamine products from
apparently redundant enzyme pairs found in Clostridium. Spermidine synthase is a key focus of this aim because
the prokaryotic orthologs of this enzyme have been shown to produce a variety of polyamine products besides
spermidine. This work will expand our fundamental understanding of the functional variations found within a key
gut microbe metabolic pathway: polyamine biosynthesis."

The goal of this proposal is to uncover the mechanistic connection between R-loops and gene expression through
effects on genome architecture to understand how R-loop deregulation can contribute to neurodevelopmental
disorders.
R-loops are poorly understood RNA-containing chromatin structures that accumulate in, and contribute to the
etiology of, several neurodevelopmental disorders. This includes Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
(ADNP) syndrome, also known as Helsmoortel-Van Der Aa syndrome, which is a rare condition in children that
exhibit signs of autism. At present, how R-loops contribute to neurological disorders like ADNP syndrome is
unclear. Accumulated R loops lead to an increased DNA damage response and can also alter transcription of
neighboring genes. However, the mechanistic basis for R loops-mediated changes in gene expression are
unknown and the functional relevance of this process to disorders like ADNP syndrome is unexplored.
We have made the surprising finding that R-loops are highly enriched at a subset of binding sites for CTCF.
Preliminary data show that R-loops strengthen CTCF interactions with chromatin. We found that conditions
leading to loss or gain of R-loops can decrease or increase CTCF recruitment, respectively, and affect long-
range genome interactions. We recently demonstrated that the activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
(ADNP), a critical protein for brain development, is a site-specific R-loop resolver. ADNP heterozygous missense
or frameshift mutations cause ADNP syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with ADNP syndrome show increased R-loops and CTCF
accumulation at ADNP binding sites. We find that ADNP binding sites are enriched for sequences that are
recognized by the genome architectural protein YY1, which has important functions in regulating enhancer-
promoter interactions especially in the neural lineage. ADNP and YY1 co-localizes at active enhancers. Our
preliminary data also identified changes in DNA methylation in ADNP syndrome hiPSCs that can potentially
impact CTCF and YY1 binding to cause pathogenic genome misfolding and aberrant neural gene expression in
ADNP syndrome. We hypothesize that R-loops have a regulatory function, and that they target CTCF and YY1
to specific genomic sites during neurodifferentiation. We posit that they may be critical for long-range genome
interactions that reinforce neural lineage specific gene expression programs. We propose to decipher the impact
of R-loop deregulation on genome organization and gene expression in the neural lineage through the lens of
ADNP syndrome. In Aim 1, we will evaluate R-loop mediated regulation of CTCF and YY1 localization during
neurodifferentiation. In Aim 2, we will examine the epigenetic consequences of distinct ADNP syndrome
mutations and their impact on genome regulatory interactions."
10890536,"Project Summary
 Given that eating frequency is largely determined by societal norms, a deeper understanding of the
neural substrates that control meal size is critical for the development of novel and more effective treatments
for obesity. The amount of food consumed over the course of a meal is determined by a competing balance
between an early-meal positive feedback process called appetition and a late-meal negative feedback process
called satiation. We hypothesize that melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), an orexigenic neuropeptide
produced in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and zona incerta (ZI), is critical in mediating the poorly
understood process of appetition. While such a role for MCH has not been directly investigated, this notion is
supported by findings revealing that MCH neurons are glucose responsive 1,2 and MCH injections augment food
intake by increasing meal size 3. A role for MCH signaling in mediating appetition is further supported by our
preliminary data showing that chemogenetic activation of MCH neurons (LHA + ZI populations) potentiates
flavor preference learning for a nonnutritive flavor paired with intragastric glucose infusion.
 MCH is produced in both the LHA and the ZI, which are adjacent regions that are differentiated both
functionally and neuroanatomically 4-7. Our preliminary results, using fiber photometry to measure MCH
neuron calcium activity in awake behaving animals, reveal that LHA and ZI MCH neurons show distinct
calcium activity dynamics during a meal, such that LHA MCH neuron activity increases during active eating
relative to interbout intervals, and ZI MCH neuron activity shows the opposite pattern (activity elevated during
interbout intervals relative to active eating). These findings introduce the possibility that LHA and ZI MCH
neurons subserve distinct but complementary functions in the control of feeding. Based on our preliminary
data, here we will evaluate our hypothesis that LHA MCH neurons promote orosensory-mediated appetition,
and ZI MCH neurons promote post-oral nutritive-mediated appetition. This hypothesis will be evaluated by
separately targeting LHA vs. ZI MCH neuron populations in Aim 1 experiments measuring physiological MCH
neuron calcium activity in response to orosensory vs. post-oral nutrient sensing in lean and obese rats, and in
Aim 2 functional chemogenetic and caspace-mediated ablation experiments determining the precise oral and
post-oral mechanisms through which MCH neuron activation promotes flavor-nutrient learning.
 In addition to exploring the physiological responses (Aim 1) and functional relevance (Aim 2) of the two
MCH neuron populations with regards to appetition and food intake, Aim 3 will combine MCH neuron
population-specific pathway tracing, metabolic brain mapping, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing
approaches to extensively characterize the anatomical, network, and transcriptional profiles of ZI vs. LHA
MCH neurons. Overall, these complementary aims will significantly advance understanding of the
hypothalamic control of food intake and shed light on the potential of MCH-based obesity pharmacotherapies."

Tumor heterogeneity and cancer stem cell (CSC) plasticity present a significant challenge to the effective
treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Several studies have established that Leucine-rich repeat containing, G
protein-coupled Receptor 5 (LGR5) marks CSCs and is highly upregulated in CRC. Plasticity of LGR5+ CSCs
has been shown to promote therapy resistance, tumor progression, and metastasis. CRC is also dependent on
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR-targeted antibodies such as cetuximab (CTX) are
routinely used for the treatment of metastatic CRC. However, the clinical efficacy of EGFR-targeted treatment
has been limited to a subset of patients that do not harbor KRAS mutations. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
have experienced a recent surge in success within the past few years and several have now been approved for
solid tumor indications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel bispecific ADC (BsADC) directed
against LGR5 and EGFR and evaluate antitumor and antimetastatic efficacy in patient-derived models of CRC.
We propose leveraging the dual-targeting capabilities of an LGR5-EGFR bispecific antibody combined with the
ability of ADCs to exert potent drug effects irrespective of tumor mutational status, while minimizing systemic
toxicity. In Aim 1, we will generate a lead LGR5-EGFR BsADC with high potency and specificity in vitro. In Aim
2, we will evaluate tolerability and therapeutic efficacy of the lead LGR5-EGFR BsADC in subcutaneous and
orthotopic patient-derived tumor models of CRC. Results from this study will lead to the development of a unique
dual-targeted ADC and determine if it can overcome therapy resistance due to tumor heterogeneity and CSC
plasticity and prevent metastasis. Moreover, an LGR5-EGFR BsADC has the potential to treat other tumor types
that express high levels of either tumor antigen."

consistent analysis of variation in time use over time and space. IPUMS Time Use data are available via three
integrated databases: (1) ATUS-X integrates the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which consists of one-day
time diary interviews with nearly 10,000 individuals aged 15 and older per year; (2) AHTUS-X harmonizes the
ATUS with historical American time use data from 1930 to 1998; and (3) MTUS-X delivers 84 harmonized time
diary datasets from 19 countries. These databases are optimized for cross-time and cross-country analyses,
eliminating the need for investigators to acquire source data from original data producers, download and manage
complex multi-level hierarchical data, and navigate differences in data structures, variable names, and coding
schemes. By freely disseminating time diary data from around the world, IPUMS Time Use engenders timely
and impactful research on time use and the health and well-being of the U.S. and global population. The
proposed project will further improve this crucial resource for pathbreaking research in four ways: (1) Data
acquisition: The team will obtain and preserve time diary microdata from across the developed world, including
the newest time diary microdata available. We will build on our team's work in this area and leverage existing
relationships with data producers. (2) Database expansion: This project phase will add five new years of ATUS
data (2022 to 2026) to ATUS-X, including data from the 2021 Well-Being, 2022-23 Eating and Health, and 2024
Leave and Job Flexibilities Modules; expand AHTUS-X by adding ATUS data through 2026 and 1936 time diary
data from women in New York; and extend the temporal and geographic coverage of MTUS-X by incorporating
new data for 19 countries currently in the database and adding three waves of data from Belgium. These
additions will add nearly 200,000 people and 4.5 million activities to the database. (3) Data, metadata, and
infrastructure improvement: Improvements will enhance research opportunities, reproducibility, and rigor: (a)
constructing new harmonized well-being, occupation, industry, geographic, health, and day and sleep quality
measures; (b) building a user-facing Application Programming Interface (API) that allows researchers to have
programmatic access to all IPUMS Time Use data and metadata; (c) enhancing online analysis capabilities by
fully integrating user-created datasets and cloud-based analyses; and (d) developing a powerful interactive tool
to illustrate possible linkages between ATUS and the Current Population Survey. (4) Expanding and supporting
the research community: Through robust user support, outreach, and training, the project will reach new,
underrepresented, and early career scholars across disciplines and train them to use time diary data."

10867463,"Abstract. Obesity induces a chronic systemic inflammatory state characterized by impaired adipokine signaling,
increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, inflammatory cell activation, enhanced generation of oxidizing
species and pathogenic shifts in metabolic intermediates and microbial profiles. This impacts pulmonary function

and normalizes airway function. We will evaluate the promising pharmacology of this new drug class via Phase
2 evaluation of the therapeutic effects of CXA-10 in subjects with late onset obesity-associated asthma. We will
a) define changes in pre bronchodilator FEV1, asthma control, and methacholine responsiveness following daily
oral CXA-10 administration to obese subjects (BMI >30) having airway hyperreactivity, via a blinded, placebo-
controlled, double cross-over study design and b) evaluate the impact of CXA-10 administration on study subject
nasal and pulmonary airway cell gene expression, urine, plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory
biomarkers and gut-lung axis microbiome responses. These mechanistic studies will reveal how CXA-10 directs
the electrophilic NO2-FA-sensitive genome and microbiome to modulate systemic and airway metabolic and
inflammatory intermediates that contribute to the obese asthmatic phenotype. We hypothesize that nitro-fatty
acid-induced signaling and metabolic responses will improve lung function, asthma control and alleviate
obesity-related airway hyperreactivity. To test this hypothesis, Aim #1 evaluates the clinical responses of
obesity-associated asthma patients to the orally-administered nitro-fatty acid, CXA-10 and Aim #2
identifies the downstream host and microbial gene expression and metabolic responses of subjects
before and after oral CXA-10 administration. Current data encourages that, in the setting of obesity, CXA-10
will limit lung dysfunction, promote adaptive signaling responses and shift gut bacterial populations and metabolic
intermediates so as to beneficially impact the gut-lung axis."
10867466,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Deaths related to opioid use disorders (OUD) have sky-rocketed in recent years, leading to a widespread public
health crisis. This opioid endemic is worsened by a lack of effective therapeutic intervention strategies that
directly target or reverse the opioid induced neuroadaptations driving drug use and relapse. Prior research
indicates that experiencing a major stressful event in life is the greatest risk factor for exacerbated opioid use
and relapse among adults. Congruent with clinical data, preclinical work indicates that acute stress in adulthood
increases psychostimulant seeking in intravenous drug self-administration rodent models, but the effects of acute
stress on opioid seeking remain unknown. Further, the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress confers
OUD susceptibility are unclear. Emerging literature shows that ventral pallidal glutamate neurons (VPGlu) are key
regulators of drug seeking behavior and aversive states, which suggests that this neuronal subpopulation may
be a strong candidate for mediating the effects of stress on OUD-relevant circuit function that exacerbates OUD
pathology. My preliminary data sought to begin addressing these gaps in the OUD literature by examining how
acute stress impacts heroin sensitization and VPGlu activity using in vivo miniscope Ca2+ imaging in non-head
fixed male and female mice. To the best of my knowledge, this preliminary work represents the first in vivo
characterization of VPGlu activity during intense acute stress, and I am the first to report that VPGlu are responsive
to both stress and heroin. Furthermore, my sensitization data demonstrate that stress produces sexually
dimorphic changes in the psychomotor effects of heroin. Taken together, these preliminary data show that adult
acute stress alters the psychomotor properties of heroin and highlight VPGlu as promising mediators of stress and
OUD-relevant behaviors. My data warrant further investigation into the impact of stress on clinically relevant
opioid behaviors such as motivation and relapse to heroin seeking, and the systematic characterization of how
stress, opioids, and their intersection regulate the activity of VPGlu by altering synaptic inputs onto these cells.
Together, my preliminary data informed my main hypothesis that acute stress will enhance heroin
motivation and relapse to heroin seeking and that stress and opioids interact to alter VPGlu synaptic
function. The goals of this proposal are to interrogate 1) how stress impacts the motivation and relapse to heroin
seeking using an intravenous self-administration model and 2) assess the effect of stress, opioids, and their
interaction on synaptic function of VPGlu using ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. The outcomes
of this proposal will determine the consequences of acute stress on clinically relevant behavioral responses to
heroin and systematically characterize alterations in synaptic function of a newly established stress-reactive
neuronal subpopulation. Completing this proposal will be invaluable to my development into a successful
physician-scientist by providing the necessary skills to perform high-impact, rigorous substance use disorder
research while gaining essential clinical proficiencies to treat patients affected by these disorders."
10867467,"Title: Overcoming drug resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer
Abstract
Because androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for development of prostate cancer (PCa), including
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) are becoming the first line
treatment for CRPC. However, the limited success of ASIs makes it urgent to develop approaches to treat
ASI-resistant CRPC. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive
Complex (PRC2) responsible for H3K27me3 and gene repression, has been identified as a promising target
in PCa. However, it was also discovered that oncogenic function of EZH2 in CRPC is PRC2-independent.
Thus, identifying regulators that control EZH2 function is of significance as it may provide an avenue to
enhance the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) in CRPC. The long-term goals of this study are to identify
druggable signaling pathways that offer effective treatment options for patients with ASI-resistant CRPC.
The objective is to define the role of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in regulating EZH2, to exploit this pathway as
a therapeutic target for ASI-resistant CRPC patients, and to examine whether Plk1-dependent
phosphorylation of EZH2 is a novel biomarker for CRPC. The central hypothesis is that Plk1 phosphorylation
of EZH2 leads to a functional switch from PRC2-dependent gene repression to PRC2-independent but AR-
dependent transcription activation, eventually contributing to disease progression into CRPC stage. Our
data show that Plk1 inhibition leads to an increased level of H3K27me3 and that Plk1 directly phosphorylates
EZH2 at T144. We also show that Plk1 phosphorylation of EZH2 results in decreased levels of H3K27me3,
destabilization of the PRC2 complex and increased association between EZH2 and AR. Our hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three Aims - (1) to dissect how Plk1 phosphorylation of EZH2 regulates the PRC2
complex; (2) to test whether expression of unphosphorylatable EZH2 antagonizes PCa progression and
enhances the efficacy of EZH2i in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models; and (3) to determine
whether Plk1 inhibitor (Plk1i) plus EZH2i is a novel approach to treat ASI-resistant CRPC and whether
pT144-EZH2 is a novel biomarker for CRPC. These complementary aims will be accomplished using
biochemical analyses of signaling intermediates and employing genetic strategies with inducible PCa mouse
models, culture systems and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) methodologies. The rationale for the research
is that it will probe the importance of Plk1 to PRC2 complex, examine whether a combination of Plk1i with
EZH2i is a novel approach to treat ASI-resistant CRPC and ask whether pT144-EZH2 is a new biomarker
to predict PCa progression. This contribution is significant because, if positive, the results of the proposed
study will support an immediate clinical trial for Plk1i plus EZH2i to treat ASI-resistant CRPC. The research
is innovative as it approaches the disease from a novel Plk1 signaling pathway, challenging the traditional
view that Plk1 functions solely to regulate mitotic events."

 The Clinical Core (CC) supports ongoing and planned research programs at UAB, contributing to national
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) research efforts. The CC focuses on clinical assessments
to support better understanding of ADRD risk factors especially prevalent in the Deep South. The CC has three
main products: (1) well-characterized participants referred to researchers in the ADRC including to the Imaging
Core and pre-consented autopsy cases for the Neuropathology Core, as well as the UAB and national ADRD
communities, (2) biofluid samples for genetic analysis and banking in the Neuropathology Core for sharing with
investigators, and (3) longitudinal clinical and functional outcome data to be made available through the Data
Management and Statistical (DMS) Core and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). Projected
enrollment will be ~525 new participants, with ~105 participants entering annually for each of the 5 years.
Cognitively unimpaired (N ~263), Mild Cognitive Impairment (N ~158) and mild dementia (N ~104) participants
will be preferentially engaged from community, rather than clinical, settings and followed annually. To
accelerate studies of health disparities in ADRD, Black or African American (B/AA) participants will be enrolled
at a proportion higher their frequency in the population of Alabama (≥40% vs. 23%). The NACC Uniform Data
Set, additional cognitive testing, assessments of social determinants of health (SDOH), body composition, and
actigraphic measures of activity will be collected, along with blood, CSF, and urine samples. Genotyping from
blood will be conducted and shared via NIAGADS. Biofluids will be aliquoted and stored for local researcher
access and sharing via NCRAD. All eligible subjects will be referred to the Imaging Core for structural and
molecular imaging (MRI, amyloid-PET, and tau-PET). A multidisciplinary Clinical Consensus Conference
determines clinical diagnoses. An innovative Biomarker Consensus Conference classifies individuals’ ATN
biomarker status while blinded to the clinical data and diagnoses. The CC will interact with all other UAB
ADRC Cores. It will function under the directives of the Administrative Core which oversees participant
referrals via the ADRC’s Protocol Review process. Retention of participants is done cooperatively with the
Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core. CC data will be managed by the DMS Core, which in turn
provides formatted data summaries to the CC for Consensus diagnosis. Autopsy coordination and pre-consent
are managed by the CC on behalf of the Neuropathology Core’s Brain Donation Program. CC activities provide
training opportunities for Research Education Component learners."
10864740,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and accurate risk prediction is crucial
for early intervention. While clinical risk scores (CRS) based on traditional risk factors are commonly used,
polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a promising tool, particularly when combined with CRS. However,
current CHD PRSs have limited predictive value, especially for populations with diverse ancestries. Additionally,
CRS fails to account for environmental and social factors that contribute to CHD disparities in minority groups.
To achieve health equity and improve CHD health for all, it is crucial to tailor CHD risk prediction approaches
to individuals based on their genetic background, susceptibility to traditional risk factors, as well as their social
and environmental context. Dr. Tcheandjieu's career goal is to leverage these factors to develop an inclusive risk
prediction strategy that mitigates disparities. In the current project, she will focus on understanding the genetic
architecture of CHD across populations. She hypothesizes that the limited predictive value of current CHD PRS
in diverse populations is due to the Eurocentric bias in their development, the exclusion of low-frequency genetic
variants, and inadequate representation of the genetic contribution of CHD risk factors, especially since the
prevalence of CHD risk factors varies across populations. To test these hypotheses, she will analyze genetic data
from 2.1 million individuals with European, African, Indigenous American, and Asian ancestries from large
biobanks. In Aim 1, she will explore population-specific differences in haplotype structures, allele frequencies,
and effect sizes of variants in CHD and PRS. In Aim 2, she will study the association between CHD and rare
variants within each ancestry, quantify CHD heritability due to rare variants, and assess their PRS predictive
value. In Aim 3, Dr. Tcheandjieu will develop population-specific CHD PRSs with enhanced predictive value by
incorporating the genetic risk for CHD and its risk factors, considering variations between ancestries and
enriching the PRS with rare variants. To achieve these aims and strive toward her career goal, Dr. Tcheandjieu
will strengthen her knowledge with training in statistical and population genetics, functional genomics, and
cardiovascular social epidemiology. Dr. Tcheandjieu will be mentored by a team of scientists with extensive
experience and expertise in various aspects of her proposed research and training. Additionally, The Gladstone
Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco are world-leading biomedical research centers. Dr.
Tcheandjieu will take advantage of the rich resources within these research environments to complete the
program. Overall, the research, training, and institutional environment described in this proposal will aid Dr.
Tcheandjieu in her long-term career goals of (1) addressing disparities of CHD susceptibility across diverse
populations and (2) becoming a successful independent investigator. Overall, the proposed research has
significant potential to address the limited applicability of current PRS to diverse populations and develop novel
and innovative CHD PRSs that improve risk prediction in diverse populations, reducing health disparities."
10864778,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Muscle weakness in VA patients most commonly results from inactivity related to injury,
illness, or surgery. Even with aggressive rehabilitation, bouts of enforced skeletal muscle inactivity can lead to
atrophy and loss of function that persist long after remobilization. While pharmacotherapies might improve
outcomes for many veterans suffering from loss of function secondary to disuse atrophy, none exist. Since age-
related loss of muscle function accelerates further loss of function and increases risk of disability, development
of a pharmacotherapy that enables full recovery of function would be transformative for veterans and the general
population. Effective recovery of atrophied skeletal muscle is dependent upon macrophages. First, macrophage
inflammation directs satellite cells to fuse with damaged fibers to facilitate repair. Then, macrophage regenerative
factors resolve inflammation and promote muscle growth. Therefore, a pharmacotherapy is needed that can
specifically target these cells within the skeletal muscle. We met this challenge by developing polymer particles
for localized, extended release of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-PLG). ATRA is in broad use clinically for
indications other than muscle wasting, but our data indicate delivery of ATRA-PLG to the facia of atrophied
muscle restores muscle fiber size, improves mobility, increases IGF-1, and decreases IL-6 in the early phase of
recovery. Also, in vitro studies indicate ATRA-PLG induces macrophages to secrete IGF-1. Therefore, our central
hypothesis is that administration of ATRA-PLG to atrophied muscle enhances 1) skeletal muscle recovery and
2) the macrophage regenerative response. We will test this hypothesis by inducing muscle atrophy with cast
immobilization in mice and then injecting ATRA-PLG with release kinetics that match the time course of muscle
recovery when the cast is removed. Specific Aim 1 will determine if ATRA-PLG delivery accelerates functional
recovery of skeletal muscle after remobilization. Specific Aim 2 will determine if ATRA-PLG delivery enhances
the macrophage regenerative response in skeletal muscle recovering from disuse. The potential of this work for
positive impact is high. A pharmacotherapy that enables full functional recovery of atrophied muscle could
revolutionize healthcare for veterans and the general population. If we are successful in rodents, the pathway to
clinical implementation is clear and straight forward. First, our therapy could be tested in large animals using
ultrasound-guided delivery, which is already used in humans for localized musculoskeletal interventions. Second,
ATRA is one of the most prescribed medications in the U.S. and PLG is implemented in 19 FDA drug
formulations. Thus, if ATRA-PLG is successful, getting this therapy to veterans may be faster and less expensive
than developing new drugs. Finally, the delivery system is versatile, able to accommodate new or additional
pharmaceutics or multiple administrations, if necessary. Given that the investigative team has the required
expertise in muscle physiology, regenerative immunology, and drug delivery to carry out the proposed work, we
are confident that the project will bring us closer to realizing a pharmacotherapy for veterans struggling to achieve
full function after prolonged immobility."

AD and how it is influenced by apolipoprotein (apo) E isotypes, using human tissue, with correlations to
findings in various AD models, using proteomic and other methods which we have recently developed. In
particular we are focusing on the differential role apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms play in: 1) AD plaque and
vessel amyloid development (Project 1); 2) therapeutic approaches that target the Aβ/apoE interaction (Project

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathology is heterogenous, yet a comprehensive understanding of the different
pathways that drive AD pathology is missing. The role of core B is to provide an unbiased characterization of
proteins and pathways affected by different apoE isoforms in AD pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches
targeting this role. Core B will provide well characterized human post mortem tissue from the NYU brain bank
and post mortem tissue received from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC). Core B will provide the
unbiased characterization of the proteome of neuropathological lesions (parenchymal and vascular amyloid)
using our recently established approach of localized proteomics - Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)
followed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The samples consist of tissues collected from
patients with AD who are apoE4, apoE3 or apoE2 carriers that have the full spectrum of AD (preclinical
cognitive normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD), and AD transgenic mice models that express
human ApoE 2,3 or 4 isoforms. In addition, the core will verify the peptoids and small drugs used in Project 2
by mass spectrometry prior to injection into mice. This core will provide a single state of the art analytical mass
spectrometry platform that will be used across all for 3 projects. This key feature will ensure that the acquired

2. Characterize and quantify the amyloid plaque and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)

 (Proje ct 1).
3. Characterize Aβ and phosphorylated tau binding proteins using affinity purifications followed
 by MS (Project 1).
4. Characterize the amyloid plaque and CAA proteomes in transgenic mice expressing apoE2,
 apoE3, apoE4 or apoE KO, with and without treatment (peptoid, small molecule drugs)
 (Proje ct 2).
5. Verify that the therapeutic antibodies developed in Project 3 cross the blood brain barrier
 (Proje ct 3).
6. Characterize the effect of passive immunotherapy with IgM and IgG AβComAbs on the CAA
 proteome in TgSwDI, 3xTg, APP/PS1 mice crossed onto an apoE2, E3 and E4 background
 (Proje ct 3).
The proteomic data generated by Core B will facilitate greater understanding of apoE’s role in the
pathogenesis of AD and will aid the discovery of proteins and pathways involved in the development of AD.
Importantly, the combined use of human tissue and AD animal models will enhance the translatability of the
findings to clinical practice."
10868511,"PROJECT 1- SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a large degree of heterogeneity in the age of onset, neuropathology and rate of disease progression in
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Why some patients are particularly vulnerable to the development of
AD is still not yet understood. We recently showed that people with rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease
(rpAD) had a significantly different amyloid plaque proteome from those with typical sporadic AD. These plaque
protein differences between AD subtypes offered insight into factors that contribute to plaque development and
factors that may influence the rate of progression of AD. We have since generated preliminary data that
suggests that similar plaque proteomic differences are also present in another subgroup of AD patients
vulnerable to AD; apoE4 carriers. The comparison of the plaque proteome in apoE4 and apoE3 carriers
identified similar protein differences in plaque proteins that were most altered in rpAD, as well as similarly
decreased levels of plaque-associated astrocyte proteins in apoE4 carriers. In this project we will test the
hypothesis that apoE4 carriers will have a significantly altered proteome of amyloid plaques and
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in comparison to apoE3 and apoE2 carriers. We expect that
proteomic differences in apoE4 carriers will be similar to those observed in rpAD. This study will identify
protein differences present in plaques and CAA in individuals particularly vulnerable to AD; specifically
comparing the protein differences that result from apoE4, apoE3 and apoE2 expression. Importantly, we will
determine the proteome composition of apoE2, 3 and 4 carriers for the full spectrum of AD from preclinical
normal, mild cognitive impairment and late stage AD. This data will be used as a comparative human dataset
for rodent proteomic studies proposed in projects 1 and 2. We will identify and validate protein differences that
are of particular interest, which represent potential novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers of AD. The
specific aims are:
1) Characterize the differences in the plaque proteome between apoE4, apoE3 and apoE2 carriers in
preclinical cognitivenormal, MCI and late AD cases.
2) Characterize the differences in the cerebral amyloid angiopathy proteome between apoE4, apoE3

10868513,"PROJECT 2- SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The pathological accumulation of Aβ peptides as toxic oligomers, amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA), either from increased production of Aβ peptides or from their inadequate clearance, is
critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) allele, a major genetic
risk factor for late-onset AD, was strongly associated with increased amyloid plaque and vascular amyloid
pathology. We have shown that using Aβ12-28P peptides to block the apoE/Aβ interaction constitutes a novel
treatment for AD by reducing brain parenchymal and vascular amyloid burden as well as tau -related pathology
in multiple AD transgenic (Tg) lines. We also showed that Aβ12-28P penetrates the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).
In our preliminary studies, we designed a peptoid library derived from the Aβ12 -28P sequence to screen for
apoE/Aβ binding inhibitors with higher efficacy and safety compared to Aβ12-28P. Cyclic peptoids typically
have better cell permeability compared to the linear peptides of the same or similar sequence. Indeed, our lead
peptoid CPO_Aβ17-21P is cyclic, has a Ki of 1.02 nM against the binding of apoE4 and Aβ, and has
therapeutic efficacy in an APP/PS1 AD Tg model. Our preliminary experiments clearly show it is highly
effective at reducing the amyloid burden at a dosage 7.5-fold lower than that used with the parent Aβ12-28P.
CPO_Aβ17-21P is therefore an outstanding starting point for further biochemical and medicinal chemistry
development of both novel peptoid and drug-like, small molecules. We propose testing our lead small, BBB-
penetrant, peptoid molecule and analogous drug-like, small molecules in vivo, hypothesizing that these will
reduce both neuronal and synaptic toxicity by inhibiting the apoE4/Aβ interaction. We will investigate how
these treatments affect the amyloid proteome, and correlate changes to findings in human tissue ( Project 1)
and the proteome in the same AD Tg models after immunotherapy (Project 3). We hypothesize that the treated
amyloid proteome in apoE4 mice will convert to a more apoE3-like proteome.
Aim 1: Design non-toxic, pharmacokinetically favorable peptoid and drug-like, small molecule
antagonists of the apoE/Aβ interaction, and characterize their effects in vitro.
Aim 2: Te st the lead peptoid and analogous drug -like, small molecules in vivo using 3xTg mice,
APP/PS1 and TgSwDI mice crossed onto human knock-in (KI) apoE2, E3 or E4, or apoE knock-out (KO)

10868514,"SUMMARY
The neuropathology of AD includes fibrillary amyloid β (Aβ) in plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA),
and hyperphosphorylated tau fibrils in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). However, the most toxic species are Aβ
and tau oligomers characterized by generic structural β-sheet secondary structure. These misfolded Aβ and
tau conformers are suitable targets for immunological intervention, although numerous clinical trials thus far
have failed due to: 1) autoimmune toxicity; 2) lack of specific concomitant targeting of oligomeric Aβ and tau
species; and 3) Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), particularly among apolipoprotein (apo)E4
carriers, thought to be associated with fibrillar vessel amyloid clearance. To overcome these limitations, we
developed innovative antibody combining sites (aβComAb paratopes) that only recognize the dominant β-
sheet secondary structure of misfolded proteins, a generic characteristic of all pathologic oligomers found in
neurodegenerative diseases. Our preliminary results show that some aβComAb combining sites on either IgM
or IgG class can, without side effects, penetrate the BBB of an AD Tg mouse model with pre-existing Aβ and
tau pathology, achieve significant cognitive rescue, reduce levels of Aβ and tau pathological oligomers, and in
a CAA AD Tg mouse model (TgSwDI) act without ARIA-like toxicity (both models on murine apoE
background). In this project, we will test the hypothesis that aβComAbs (IgM or IgG), unlike mAbs directed
against Aβ sequences (6E10), can be infused safely and produce modifying therapeutic effects without
vascular ARIA-like toxicity in 3xTg and the vascular TgSwDI or APP/PS1dE9 mouse models cross-bred
to human apoE2, E3, or E4 backgrounds. Furthermore, we anticipate that the vascular amyloid
proteomes of these mice will resemble those that Projects 1 and 2 associate with different apoE
backgrounds, treatments, and presence or absence of microhemorrhages. This information is critically
needed to elucidate the mechanism associated with ARIA and select aβComAbs paratopes for future clinical
trials. The specific aims are to:
1) Produce and characterize IgM and IgG forms of combining sites (AβComAb paratopes) that specifically
recognize the β-sheet secondary structures of toxic oligomers.
2) Determine the biochemical and histochemical interaction of the four aβComAbs from Aim 1 with the brain
vasculature of peripherally infused TgSwDI mice crossed on KI human ApoE2, E3, and E4 backgrounds.
3) Determine behavioral, histochemical, and biochemical changes after passive immunotherapy with two
AβComAb paratopes on an IgM and an IgG selected from Aim 2, in 3xTg, Tg APP/PS1dE9, and TgSwDI mice
crossed on KI human ApoE2, E3, and E4 backgrounds."

1,4-Dioxane (1,4-DX) is an emerging drinking water contaminant. The potential for 1,4-DX exposure is
elevated for people living near Superfund or other types of 1,4-DX release sites. The International Agency for
Research on Cancer has classified 1,4-DX as a group 2B carcinogen with the primary organ target being the
liver in animal studies. Despite this concern, safety standards for 1,4-DX in drinking water have been slow to
develop and vary widely, with the variability being related to the uncertainty associated with its liver
carcinogenic potential. Mechanistic studies are urgently needed to (i) understand how 1,4-DX may contribute
to liver carcinogenesis by itself or in combination with other co-occurring drinking water contaminants [such as
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA)], (ii) determine the exposure concentration range
over which these effects occur, and (iii) identify potentially more vulnerable subgroups. Our preliminary studies
in mice have revealed molecular targets and pathways potentially involved in 1,4-DX carcinogenicity and set
the stage for the proposed studies. These preliminary studies utilized various 1,4-DX concentrations (50, 500
and 5,000 ppm) in drinking water for periods of up to 3 month. These studies revealed mild liver cytotoxicity
that is consistent with previous studies. The highest 1,4-DX dose induced assorted molecular changes in the
liver including: (i) persistent induction of NRF2 and its target proteins involved in anti-oxidative response (i.e.,
GCLC, GCLM, HMOX1 and NQO1), (ii) time-dependent induction of CYP2E1 (key oxidative pathway capable
of activating endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and a generator of reactive oxygen species), (iii)
centrilobular accumulation of the lipid peroxidation by-product 4-HNE, and (iv) elevations in the DNA damage
marker γH2AX. Importantly, these 1,4-DX-elicited molecular changes were amplified in a mouse model of
systemic glutathione (GSH) deficiency. This project will build upon these intriguing findings and investigate our
novel hypothesis predicting that long-term exposure to 1,4-DX causes liver tumorigenesis by disrupting redox
homeostasis, thereby potentiating genetic instability. This proposed 1,4-DX mode of action would be of high
relevance in assessing carcinogenic effects of co-occurring contaminants that may utilize or modulate
overlapping molecular pathways. We propose to (1) delineate the contribution of key redox pathways to 1,4-DX
liver carcinogenicity in vivo using transgenic redox mouse models, (2) identify the biological network motifs that
predict 1,4-DX-induced liver carcinogenesis and the dose response pattern for perturbation of these networks
in vivo, and (3) elucidate the capacity of co-occurring contaminants (TCE and 1,1-DCA) to modify 1,4-DX

1,4-Dioxane (1,4-DX) is a synthetic chemical historically used as a stabilizer of chlorinated solvents and
currently used in a range of consumer and personal care products. Over one-fifth of the US public drinking
water supply contains detectable levels of 1,4-DX, and approximately 7% of drinking water samples tested
exceed the federal cancer risk level of 0.35 μg/L. Widespread contamination of drinking water has been
observed in groundwater in Nassau and Suffolk Counties of Long Island, New York, where 75% of population
have water sources with 1,4-DX concentrations exceeding 0.35 μg/L. Furthermore, standard municipal
treatment systems are ineffective at removing 1,4-DX, enabling its persistence in drinking water supplies. The
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated 1,4-DX as a “high priority” chemical and classified
it as a probable human carcinogen based on evidence from experimental animal studies, primarily based on
effects on the liver. Despite the high prevalence in the environment and potential human health risks, there is a
paucity of human exposure and health data. We will apply novel approaches to evaluate exposure to 1,4-DX
and co-occurring contaminants (such as the volatile organic compounds 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA),
trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA)) in two communities: Long Island, New York (our
primary study area) and Cape Fear River Watershed, North Carolina (secondary study area). We will use our
newly developed, highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based assay for assessment of exposure to 1,4-DX in
water and blood samples. In addition, we will evaluate associations between exposure to 1,4-DX and co-
contaminants and levels of endogenous metabolites and lipids in blood using both untargeted and targeted
metabolomics. The use of biomonitoring and metabolomics provide powerful tools to assess early exposures
and biological changes in the years preceding clinical manifestation of disease. We propose a cross-sectional
study on Long Island (an area with many Superfund sites potentially contributing to contamination of drinking
water with 1,4-DX) to i) assess human exposure to 1,4-DX and evaluate the relationship between
environmental and biological exposure indicators, ii) evaluate temporal variability of exposure to 1,4-DX and
metabolite levels by comparing data from two different US regions with different water sources (ground water
in NY and surface water in NC), and iii) evaluate the relationship between 1,4-DX exposure and metabolites of
biological responses particularly for liver toxicity and carcinogenesis. This project will greatly enhance our
understanding of the extent of exposure to 1,4-DX (and its co-occurring contaminants) in drinking water and
the potential for human health effects. The results will provide scientific evidence for policy makers to set
guidelines for concentration standards for 1,4-DX and provide researchers in the Superfund Research Program
with new tools to detect hazardous substances in the environment as well as novel technologies for
remediation."
10868587,"ABSTRACT
Groundwater in Superfund sites is contaminated with a wide range of hazardous chemicals originating from
anthropogenic and natural sources. Individuals exposed to these chemicals through contaminated drinking water
can be subjected to adverse health effects. The YSRTP will focus on 1,4-dioxane (1,4-DX) and its co-occurring
contaminants: trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA). To protect
drinking water supplies and human health, rapid approaches for the detection and monitoring of these
contaminants are crucial. The overall goal of this project is to develop sensors for 1,4-DX and its co-contaminants
with real-time monitoring via a wireless network. The project includes four specific aims: (1) developing and
characterizing biosensors for 1,4-DX detection and quantification, (2) developing and characterizing chemical
sensors for 1,4-DX co-occurring contaminants (TCE, TCA, and DCA), (3) 1,4-DX and co-contaminant detection
via portable vacuum gas chromatography, and (4) demonstrating detection in a distributed wireless sensor
network for contaminant monitoring. The main innovative aspects of the research include the following: (i)
developing the first sensor for detecting low, health relevant concentrations of 1,4-DX, by employing an
evolutionary selection process, an artificially antibody affinity maturation technique, and organometallic pre-
binding molecules; (ii) developing a chemical sensor that exploits the unique solubility-based selectivity of lipid
and block-copolymer bilayer vesicles for detecting TCE, DCA, and TCA as a proxy for 1,4-DX contamination;
and (iii) demonstrating the use of 1,4-DX sensors and adapted portable vacuum gas chromatographers in a
wireless sensor network (WSN) to enable responses to dynamic contamination and exposure events. The project
is well integrated with the overall YSRTP. The real time data of contaminant concentrations provided by the WSN
will be integrated Project 4 to improve remediation strategies and measure remediation effectiveness and help
inform the biomedical projects (Projects 1,2) on exposures for communities in the vicinity of the Superfund sites,
and inform the community—through the Community Engagement Core—on real-time concentrations of the
target contaminants in drinking water sources. The project will also be engaged with the Data Management &
Analysis Core (DMAC) to appropriately store and analyze all contaminant occurrence and concentration data
pursuant to the above project interactions and for assistance in the WSN to meet the stated measurement goals."
10868588,"ABSTRACT
The ultimate goal of this remediation project is to design, fabricate, test, and implement point-of-use, small-
scale, water treatment systems that can remove 1,4-dioxane (1,4-DX) and its frequently co-occurring
contaminants, trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) and 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA),
from contaminated ground water. The advanced oxidation process (AOP)–the process that employs highly
reactive •OH as main oxidant–is considered to be the most effective among established water treatment
methods for the destruction of these contaminants. However, enabling AOP in a small-scale, distributed
system (i.e., in contrast to centralized large-scale treatment and water delivery through a network of pipe) is
technically challenging due to the requirement for a precursor chemical (such as H2O2) that needs to be
activated on site to produce •OH and the high energy demand.
 We will synthesize efficient catalyst materials, engineer various components of the system, and
fabricate two highly-innovative prototype AOP reactors. The first reactor will employ a new catalyst that can
selectively produce high concentrations of H2O2 using only water and oxygen as a source. The produced H2O2
will be activated by another newly-developed catalyst to produce •OH without any external energy/chemical
supplies and without producing undesirable byproducts (which would otherwise require additional treatment).
Coupled together, this catalytic system will enable for the first time AOP of ground water in a small, compact,
distributed water treatment system. The second reactor will employ nanobubble technology. In this system,
ambient air will be introduced to the water in the form of nanobubbles which collapse to produce •OH that will
destroy 1,4-DX. Strategies to enhance the production of •OH through promotion of effective bubble collapse
will be developed. Unlike any existing AOPs, both reactors will not require continuous supply of chemicals. In
addition, they will either be solar powered (completely off-grid) or use a much smaller amount of electricity than
conventional AOPs that employ ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.
 We will test the performance of prototype reactors and compare them with benchmark UV/H2O2
process (i.e., adding H2O2 and irradiating UV light). This will involve a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency
of parent compound (1,4-DX) destruction, as well as the evolution of reaction byproducts. Reduction of the
deleterious effects of consuming 1,4-DX-containing water will be investigated in collaboration with Research
Project 1. The prototype reactors will undergo testing in select field sites in Region 1 (identified as being
contaminated by Research Project 2) to determine their efficiency under real world situations and their activity
under long term conditions (employing sensors developed by Research Project 3). By promoting the continual
removal of 1,4-DX and its co-occurring contaminants from drinking water sources, this project will directly
reduce human exposure to these pollutants and thereby limit their adverse health effects."
10868590,"CORE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT- ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core (AC) will lead and provide oversight of the Yale Superfund Research and Training
Program (YSRTP) and ensure it achieves its goal to protect public health by characterizing emerging water
contaminants, elucidating their toxicity, assessing exposures to human populations, and detecting and
remediating contamination. The AC is comprised of a highly qualified administrative team that will lead the
YSRTP which includes: 1) three additional cores (Data Management & Analysis, Community Engagement, and
Research Experience and Training Coordination) and 2) four research projects (two biomedical research projects
(BMR) and two environmental science and engineering projects (ESE)). The AC will coordinate research projects
and cores to: 1) create new knowledge related to potential health effects, exposure detection, and remediation
of the emerging drinking water contaminant 1,4-dioxane (1,4-DX) and common mixtures of co-occurring
contaminants found at Superfund sites and in water supplies that are of high interest to the Superfund Research
Program (SRP) and its stakeholders, 2) promote research translation, and dissemination and utilization of the
findings from the scientific activities in the YSRTP, and 3) integrate efforts with other Superfund Research and
Training Programs, the NIEHS, the EPA and other stakeholders to achieve a greater national (and international)
impact for policy change.
The well-qualified personnel engaged in the AC have been carefully selected to ensure that our YSRTP will meet
its objectives addressing the four SRP mandates. The Research Translation Coordinator (RTC) and the Deputy
Directors will serve as catalysts and as powerful conduits for communication and coordination with the projects
and cores. The AC staff members have a long history of managing multi-disciplinary, multi-investigator
extramural programs and institutional Centers. In addition, the AC has obtained strong institutional support from
all Yale Schools participating in the YSRTP. Through the support provided by the Schools at Yale University, the
YSRTP will be recognized as an Institutional Center that will enhance the visibility of the SRP and ensure
centralized monetary support. Our External and Internal Advisory Committees will help guide and evaluate our
program. The leadership and personnel of the AC are highly qualified and eager to manage the YSRTP
effectively to support our Core and Project PIs and trainees as we pursue the NIEHS-SRP mission."
10868592,"Summary/Abstract:
The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will provide the Yale Superfund Research Program
(YSRTP) with a state of the art data management, bioinformatics and environmental statistics infrastructure that
will serve as a focal point for integrated data management and analytics across YSRTP projects and cores. The
proposed YSRTP research projects will yield a significant amount of data with a range of types and features that
will require a robust data management component, systematic bioinformatics analyses for various omics data,
and sophisticated statistical analyses including but not limited to methods for spatially and spatiotemporally
correlated data, high dimensionality, large datasets, and missingness (e.g., limits of detection). Thus, DMAC will
be critical to the functioning of the YSRTP and leverages the expertise from the Yale School of Public Health
Department of Biostatistics and its Division of Health Informatics along with value-added expertise provided by
their affiliated centers: Yale Center for Analytical Sciences, Yale Center for Medical Informatics and Yale Center
for Statistical Genomics and Proteomics. Given these resources, DMAC will provide ready access to well-
qualified, experienced clinical informaticians, biostatisticians and bioinformaticians who have previously
established, successful collaborations with many of the investigators in the YSRTP. The expertise provided will
include a full spectrum of consultations with PhD-level faculty for data capture and management, and design and
analysis of projects. DMAC will manage the data flow within and beyond this YSRTP program and will work
closely with all cores and project scientists to integrate the data from all projects to develop and test scientific
hypotheses. DMAC will also serve as a hub for providing feedback to project scientists to drive further scientific
investigations and innovation to advance the aims and objectives of the YSRTP. To achieve these objectives,
DAMC will focus on three specific aims: Aim 1: Coordination with Projects and Cores; Aim 2: Fostering Data
Sharing and Interoperability and Aim 3: Data Quality Assurance, Quality Control and Data Integration.
Achievement of these aims and objectives promises to significantly accelerate the overall objective of the YSRTP
to foster and conduct research that improves the detection, toxicological evaluation, risk assessment, mitigation
and forecasting of emerging contaminants in drinking water."
10868593,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will build bidirectional partnerships with target communities to enhance
understanding of the health risks posed by emerging water contaminants in the environment (specifically 1,4-
dioxane (1,4-DX)), and to provide interventional strategies that will improve public health and inform health policy.
In the first phase of the project, the CEC will focus on communities in Nassau and Suffolk counties of Long
Island, New York. These communities include residents whose public drinking water wells are impacted by
nearby EPA Superfund sites. The CEC will work with the Research Translation Coordinator (in the Administrative
Core) to develop replicable tools and resources to provide data and generate knowledge among stakeholders
who are invested in addressing water-related issues in the State of New York, especially in areas near Superfund
sites. To accomplish this, we will identify effective methods to communicate risk information to each stakeholder
group, including the economically-disadvantaged and environmental justice communities proximal to these sites.
The specter of emerging contaminants in drinking water is fraught with uncertainty about risk and appropriate
courses of action, creating an atmosphere of confusion, blame, anxiety and, most importantly, mistrust. The CEC
will address these challenges through facilitation of engagement and information exchange among the diverse
and relevant constituencies in NY. We will create opportunities for constituent groups, including federal, state
and local governmental agencies, to learn from each other and share information. We will encourage and
facilitate multi-directional interactions among communities and experts to complement and support the Yale
Superfund Research and Training Program’s (YSRTP’s) overarching objective of fostering research that
improves the exposure assessment, health evaluations, and mitigation of emerging contaminants in drinking
water in EPA Regions 1 (New England) and 2 (New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and eight
Tribal Nations) and North Carolina. In addition, we will collaborate with the Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core (RETCC) to educate and train the next generation of scientists to conduct citizen science and
develop skills for advocating for environmental justice and equity. The initiatives implemented in this proposal
will be transferable to other communities facing similar challenges including the State of New Hampshire, which
will be the second targeted area for CEC activities. We will also be sharing our findings and experience with the
North Carolina State University Superfund Center, which is collaborating with the YSRTP’s research projects.
The overarching goal of the CEC is to engage, educate and empower residents in impacted communities so
they may understand and inform public health policy, and participate in the improvement of public health. Results
of this collaborative effort will have a significant impact on the health of human populations in New York and New
Hampshire, aid the resolution of similar challenges at Superfund sites throughout the U.S.A., and enhance global
efforts to monitor, remediate and determine the impact of water contaminants."
10876912,"Cell fate is controlled by master regulators, as is also the case in the nervous system. Pax6 is a highly conserved
transcription factor consisting of two DNA-binding domains and a transcriptional activation domain. It is broadly
expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells and plays pivotal roles in neuronal specification, migration, and axonal
projections. Through a series of in vivo screens, we discovered that PAX6 is also capable of inducing new
neurons from genetically traced glial cells in the adult mouse spinal cord. Based on such exciting data, we
hypothesize that PAX6-induced adult neurogenesis from resident glial cells may represent an alternative strategy
for neural regeneration. The major goal of this project is to characterize the PAX6-induced adult neurogenesis
process and determine its functional role following traumatic neural injuries. We propose three specific aims to
accomplish this goal. First, we will employ genetic lineage tracing and genome-wide deep sequencing to
understand how PAX6 induces new neurons from resident glial cells in the adult mouse spinal cord. Secondly,
we will employ recombinant virus-mediated transsynaptic tracing to delineate the network connections of PAX6-
induced new neurons. And thirdly, we will use chemogenetics to tease out the functional role of PAX6-induced
new neurons on behavior in adult mice with traumatic injury."

The specification and robust maintenance of the germ line stem cells and their differentiated descendants that
form gametes are essential to the success of an organismal lineage. Stem cell niches are primary regulators of
stem cell fate, which is characterized by continuous self-renewal with the capability of differentiation. Therefore
the structure of stem cell niches—which often have extensive cellular contacts with their supported stem cell
populations that must be broken by daughter cells that go on to differentiate—appear crucial for the regulation
of the cell fate decision. Such contacts are shared in a variety of stem cell niches, but studies relating niche
structure to function lag behind genetic analysis of stem cell regulation. Stem cell niches lie deep in tissues,
making them difficult to observe, and stem cell divisions are stochastic. This proposal avoids these challenges
by studying the germ line stem cell niche of C. elegans, an animal that is suited to multiplex in vivo imaging.
The overall goal for the research program is to discover how undifferentiated germ stem cells receive cues
from their micro-environment to stimulate proliferation and the cell fate switch to gamete differentiation, and
how the dynamic cell structures supporting germ stem cells form. Conserved proliferation and cell growth
pathways are relevant to human health. Pursuit of these questions will lead to insights that, like other findings
made in this canonical stem cell niche model, may be broadly applicable to other stem cell systems.
Overview of research and goals for the next five years: The Gordon Lab opened at UNC just before the
pandemic began. It pursues key questions like: How do the stem cell niche and gonad sheath cells grow and
internally partition themselves to interact appropriately with germ cells at different steps of the differentiation
program? Both the niche cell and sheath undergo substantial growth and transformation during development.
Both somatic cells will be genetically manipulated to determine if effects on germ cell proliferation are mediated
by growth and partitioning of these regulatory cells. Cell-specific RNAi strains will be used to screen for genes
resulting in diminished Sh1 growth and germ cell proliferation. What molecular mechanisms underlie oriented
cell divisions at the niche boundary and asymmetrical cell fate acquisition? Spindle orientation has been
studied in great detail in early C. elegans embryos, but it was not known that divisions in proliferating germ
cells were oriented. Adhesion between the niche and germ cells was a neglected area of inquiry until recent
findings implicated cadherin complexes—which orient spindles in the embryo—in the dramatic wrapping
behavior of the niche around the stem cells. How does the stem cell niche mature from larvae to adults? RNA-
seq of niche cells across the larva/adult transition will identify candidate genes that are correlated with the
transition from a migratory niche during gonad growth to a stationary, mature adult niche. These and known
genes will be investigated by tagging and loss of function analysis in live-imaging studies of the transition.
Together this work will address arising and long-standing questions about a classical stem cell model system."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive map of sequence and structural variation of the
NK (natural killer) cell receptome in ancestrally diverse human populations. The two genomic regions encoding
NK cell receptors, leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) and natural killer complex (NKC), house more than 90
genes with an essential role in NK cell cytotoxicity against infected and cancer cells. The complex structural
variation and the high degree of sequence identity among genes within these regions have served as barriers to
a comprehensive analysis in former genome-wide association and sequencing studies. With our expertise and

10877090,"Despite intense obesity research and growing knowledge of central and peripheral mechanisms that
modulate food intake and energy expenditure, lifestyle interventions to treat obesity have been consistently
unsuccessful in the long-term.
 Powerful physiological adaptations to fasting and food restriction oppose weight loss and are thought to
be the culprit that prevents long-term maintenance of weight loss. Yet, our understanding of these physiological
adaptations and the neuronal circuits involved is insufficient.
 Our work on leptin responsive neurons in the hypothalamus (POALepr and DMHLepr neurons) has
indicated that temperature sensing and energy sensing integrate in the same neuronal circuits that modulate
energy expenditure (EE) and food intake (FI). Furthermore, our data indicate that EE and FI are regulated
independent circuits.
 In line with this, we show compelling evidence that temperature and energy state greatly impact each
other due to explicit changes in neuronal activity within these circuits. Our working hypothesis integrates
known energy sensing circuits with temperature sensing circuits and highlights important changes in leptin
sensitivity that are not only impacted by energy sensing but also with ambient temperature, highlighting leptin
resistance as a physiological, rather than pathological condition. This novel view is an important progress for
our understanding of physiological adaptations that will be important for human and animal studies of
metabolism in health and disease.
The proposed experiments focus on the neuronal circuit integration of temperature-dependent and energy
state dependent changes in EE and FI.
 In Aim 1 we will investigate warm-sensing POALepr neurons that project to the DMH and their role to
suppress EE via cold-sensing DMHLepr. Furthermore, we will show that cold-sensing DMHLepr are also regulated
by energy sensing ARC neurons.
 In Aim 2 we will investigate warm-sensing POALepr neurons that project to the ARC and their role to
suppress FI via anorexigenic ARCPOMC neurons.
 In Aim 3 we will investigate the role of leptin and dynamic changes in leptin sensitivity to selectively
regulate EE via DMH-projecting Lepr neurons, while FI is regulated via PVN projecting Lepr neurons."

Drug therapy in glioblastoma (GBM) almost invariably fails in patients despite having shown efficacy in preclinical
models, or in the treatment of other solid tumors. One important reason for failure is insufficient drug penetration
across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Pulsed-ultrasound (US) with concomitant injection of intravenous
microbubbles transiently disrupts the BBB, enhancing delivery of drugs to the brain. In patients this requires
ultrasound waves to bypass the thick human skull. Here we use an US device implanted into a skull window that
has been successfully tested in Phase 1 clinical trials. Prior studies have shown BBB disruption, and prolonged
progression-free survival of recurrent GBM patients treated with US-mediated BBB and carboplatin
chemotherapy. Yet, the true effect of US-based BBB disruption on drug concentrations in peri-tumoral human
brain remains unknown, while achieving adequate drug concentrations in the peri-tumoral tissue is key for
targeting infiltrating GBM cells beyond surgical margins. Paclitaxel (PTX) is exquisitely potent against GBM in
preclinical models. Prior clinical studies exploring PTX’s role in GBM showed that in the peri-tumoral brain the
drug was undetectable. Moreover, Cremophor™, the solvent used in conventional PTX formulations has
neurotoxicity. Thus, whereas PTX remains one of the most potent drugs against GBM, it cannot be exploited
due to poor BBB penetration and vehicle-related toxicity. Our recent work demonstrates that a novel FDA-
approved formulation of albumin-bound PTX (Abraxane®, ABX) that does NOT contain Cremophor™, is well
tolerated and exhibits better brain and other tissue penetration than conventional PTX. US-based BBB disruption
increased PTX brain tissue concentrations 5-fold. Our premise is that PTX will be effective against human GBM
if sufficient tumor and brain concentrations are achieved. We hypothesize that US-based delivery of ABX will be
tolerated, substantially increase PTX concentrations in peri-tumoral brain, and provide a survival benefit for
recurrent GBM patients. To investigate this, we will conduct a Phase I/II trial of US-enhanced delivery of ABX for
recurrent GBM patients. We will determine safety and MTD, and evaluate for early-signs of efficacy (Aim 1). We
will use a 2nd generation implantable US device that covers a 9-fold broader sonication volume than the initial
prototypes, and we use ABX, a drug that is far more potent in all preclinical models than the previously studied
carboplatin. We will biopsy and measure PTX concentrations in various zones of the tumor and infiltrated peri-
tumoral tissue following US-based BBB disruption (Aim 2). Repeat MRI will allow for determination whether the
field of BBB disruption is associated with local disease control and prevents progression (Aim 3). These studies
will 1) determine the safety of US-based BBB disruption with concomitant ABX infusion, 2) quantify the effect of
BBB disruption on PTX brain concentrations, and 3) provide clinical and radiographic assessment of efficacy.

 There have been great advances over the past 40 years in understanding how light initiates vision in
rod and cone photoreceptors of the eye. Not only is the sequence of events in this process known, but the
genes coding for the key phototransduction proteins have also been cloned. Mutations of many of these
genes are found to be associated with various vision-impairing diseases.
 Phototransduction starts from the visual pigment. A little over ten years ago, we made major
advances by showing that the dark spontaneous activity of rod and cone pigments indeed comes from
canonical isomerization of the pigment albeit being driven by thermal instead of light energy. We developed
a physicochemical theory that is able to predict quantitatively the 107-fold range in thermal activity across
canonical (i.e., native) rod and cone pigments in the visible spectrum as well as that of a man-made, hybrid
pigment with both rod-pigment-like and cone-pigment-like properties. Considering visual pigments’
fundamental importance in both basic and clinical science, we propose in Aim 1 to understand native
pigments further. In particular, we would like to examine the effect of protonation (found in the great majority
of L, M and S- pigments, which detect visible light) versus non-protonation (found in mouse S(UV)-sensitive
pigment and some others) at the Schiff-base linkage between apo-opsin and 11-cis-retinal on the
spontaneous isomerization of a pigment. There is suggestion from chemistry by others that unprotonated
pigments are much noisier in darkness. Additionally, an unusual property of S-pigments is that they belong
to two distinct evolutionary sub-groups: SWS1 (minor subgroup) and SWS2 (major subgroup). In preliminary
experiments during this grant period, we have found some evidence to suggest that SWS1 pigments are
much noisier in darkness. We propose in Aim 2 to address this question closely and quantitatively by
examining several pigments belonging to one or the other subgroup. Finally, unlike rod pigments, cone
pigments have some tendency to re-dissociate spontaneously in darkness into apo-opsin and 11-cis-retinal
(i.e., without isomerization). Importantly, because apo-opsin has weak constitutive activity, it triggers
transduction to produce electrical noise even in darkness. Most recently, we found surprisingly that, in fully
dark-adapted goldfish L(red)-cones, the fractional apo-opsin content is as high as ~30%, although only ~3%
in green (M) cones and negligible in blue (S) cones. In Aim 3, we would like to know whether mammalian
cones when fully dark-adapted also have a significant amount of apo-opsin. We shall examine several
species, including marmoset (a primate) and, if available, macaque. Techniques involved primarily suction-
pipette recording and microspectrophotometry from native cones."

 The proposed studies seek to investigate the underlying disease mechanisms of Lewy body dementia
(LBD) associated with the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) isoform. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for LBD,
and our recent research has shown a direct influence of APOE4 on α-synuclein (αSyn) pathology in the
human brain and mouse models. However, the mechanistic relationship between APOE4 and LBD remains
unclear. APOE, primarily produced by astrocytes, mediates cell-to-cell lipid transport in an isoform-dependent
manner. APOE4 is known to disrupt brain lipid homeostasis and compromise the endosomal-lysosomal
system, which are pathways also associated with other LBD hits, GBA and BIN1. This suggests that these
pathways may be key mechanisms linking APOE4 to LBD. Moreover, APOE4 is associated with the risk and
severity of LBD, but not necessarily Parkinson’s disease (PD). This leads to the speculation that the effects of
APOE4 on αSyn pathology may manifest more in the neocortex where LBD pathologies are found and have
minimal impact on subcortical or brainstem structures where Lewy pathology is predominant in PD. Therefore,
the proposed research aims to investigate the role of APOE4 in αSyn pathogenesis and define the underlying
molecular pathways and brain region vulnerability using human postmortem brains, astrocyte-specific APOE3
or APOE4 deletion mouse models, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived organoid models.
In Aim 1, we will perform multi-omics profiling (bulk RNA iso-seq, single nuclei RNA-seq, proteomics, and
lipidomics) of the superior temporal cortex and midbrain of human LBD cases from APOE3/3 and APOE4/4
individuals. We will conduct network analysis to uncover lipid and endosomal-lysosomal related dysfunction,
and other pathways associated to LBD and APOE4. In Aim 2, conditional mouse models will be used to delete
APOE3 or APOE4 in astrocytes by crossing human APOE knock-in mice, where murine Apoe is replaced with
floxed APOE3 or APOE4 gene, with Aldh1l1-CreER mice and human SNCA-overexpression mice. Deletion of
APOE will be induced by tamoxifen treatment at different stages of αSyn pathogenesis. The αSyn pathology
related phenotypes will be evaluated and multi-omics profiling will be conducted in the experimental mice. In
Aim 3, we will validate the cellular mechanisms of APOE4 on affecting αSyn pathogenesis, lipid homeostasis,
and endosomal-lysosomal functions using iPSC-derived cortical and midbrain-like organoid models from
patients carrying SNCA triplication and different APOE genotypes edited by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
Together, this innovative proposal will utilize unique human brain resources, mouse models, and human iPSC-
derived models, and combine state-of-the-art approaches for multi-dimensional integration of molecular
profiling to comprehensively investigate the pathomechanisms of APOE4 in LBD. These efforts will contribute
to our understanding of the APOE4-mediated pathways involved in αSyn pathology, providing valuable
insights for the development of future therapeutic strategies targeting APOE in the treatment of LBD."

The neurocognitive side effects of cancer chemotherapy in pediatric patients are heart-breaking; not only must
these children deal with the hardship of the disease and harsh treatment, but they often also face
neurocognitive impairments that affect their performance in school and their daily life as cancer survivors.
These brain toxicities, named “chemobrain”, or Chemotherapy-related Cognitive Impairment (CRCI), include
immediate symptoms (confusion, memory impairment, ataxia), as well as prolonged neurocognitive
malfunctions. THE GAP IN THE FIELD: Not enough is known about the molecular mechanisms of
chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Specifically, metabolic aberrations in the brain that ensue following therapy
with metabolic drugs such as the anti-folate MTX, a standard of care for childhood leukemia, is an unexplored
field. To be able to offer solutions to chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity it is critical to first understand the
molecular mechanisms of the toxicity caused by common chemotherapies. Therefore, THE GOAL OF THIS
PROJECT is to elucidate targetable mechanisms that mediate and modify chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity
with focus on oxidative distress. HYPOTHESIS: A good understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CRCI
is required to be able to offer preventive care or treatment. PRELIMINARY DATA: We applied metabolite
profiling of MTX-treated mouse and human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to study the metabolic impact of the drug
and revealed oxidative distress in the CSF and the choroid plexus (ChP), the organ that produces the CSF. We
found that in addition to damaging the ChP and CSF, MTX also caused toxicity to neurons in the hippocampus.
However, these findings offer some hope: the CSF can serve as a conduit for therapy because it is relatively
accessible for clinical intervention and reaches all parts of the brain. Indeed, our discovery that MTX treatment
causes reduction in CSF levels of the secreted antioxidant enzyme SOD3, both in mice and in MTX-treated
patients, led us to test CSF-based therapy; ChP-targeted gene therapy with exogenous SOD3 expression
replenishes CSF's protective capacity, preventing metabolic damage in the hippocampus and even rescues
MTX-induced behavioral deficits in mice. APPROACH: We will test our hypothesis that the ChP-CSF system
can be harnessed to alter the brain redox environment to reduce adverse effects of chemotherapy on non-
cancerous brain cells by assessing the mechanisms by which CSF-SOD3 protects the hippocampus from
MTX-induced toxicity (Aim 1), by studying the role of nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite in the MTX-induced
oxidative damage in ChP cells and neurons (Aim 2), and by testing if resuming oxidative balance in the CSF
can be achieved by peripheral and brain-specific injection of antioxidants, and whether these are sufficient to
mitigate oxidative damage to ChP and hippocampus (Aim 3). IMPACT: Our study will reveal actionable tools
to mitigate the neurological damage induced by MTX, and other chemotherapies, and the immediate potential
of antioxidants co-administration with chemotherapy for amelioration of CRCI and improved survivorship."
10882226,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack a stable globular structure and are prevalent in the human
proteome. They have many important biological functions, including serving as scaffold platforms that coordinate
multiple proteins, forming membrane-less organelles, and acting as protein and nucleic acid chaperones. We
discovered an unstructured protein domain within the PALB2 protein (Partner and Localizer of BRCA2)
that recombines nucleic acid strands. Homologous recombination (HR) is a complex multistep reaction
essential for all living organisms and directed by only a few known globular proteins. Recombination supported
by the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of PALB2 represents a novel function of IDPs and a new
paradigm in nucleic acid metabolism. This proposal will establish the molecular mechanism of this novel IDP
function. Sequence and structural properties of the PALB2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and enrichment of
eukaryotic DNA repair factors with disordered DBDs suggest a general hypothesis that similar regions evolved
as a common tool to handle complex multistrand DNA and RNA intermediates during chromosome repair. We
will investigate this hypothesis using the PALB2-binding domain of BRCA1. Results will be critical for establishing
a functional role the PALB2-DBD IDR in DNA repair and will help to identify similar IDRs in other DNA and RNA
metabolism factors.
 PALB2 is a central hub for large DNA repair complexes that mediates HR or a homology-directed repair
(HDR) of chromosome breaks. PALB2 interacts with at least a dozen proteins, including breast cancer
susceptibility proteins 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2) and the major homologous recombinase RAD51. We identified
major DNA-binding amino acids in the PALB2-DBD that significantly contribute to DNA repair in cells. We
discovered that PALB2-DBD is structurally disordered and can direct DNA or RNA strand exchange. We
demonstrated that PALB2-DBD forms a compact dimer and condenses ssDNA. Thus, we hypothesize that a
novel chaperone-like mechanism promotes PALB2-DBD-mediated strand exchange. Here, we will investigate
this hypothesis using a set of complementary structural and spectroscopy methods (including single-molecule
analysis) to determine conformational changes of PALB2-DBD and DNA. Furthermore, we will generate
separation-of-function mutants for future studies of the physiological role of PALB2-mediated strand exchange
in cells and will determine how the disordered PALB2-DBD regulates the activity of major recombinase RAD51.
This work will establish the structural and mechanistic bases of PALB2 recombinational properties, will provide
insights into the function of PALB2-mediated strand exchange in cellular DNA repair and genome maintenance,
and will drive research of other scaffold proteins, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, with intrinsically disordered DBDs.
These results will yield unique insights into cancer etiology, aging, neurodegeneration, and other pathologies."

Bacterial endophthalmitis is a vision-threatening complication of eye surgeries and ocular trauma. The vision
loss in endophthalmitis occurs due to uncontrolled inflammation-mediated retinal tissue damage. The long-term
goal of our research has been to study the pathobiology of endophthalmitis and identify potential therapeutic
targets for treatment. Our recent work using transcriptomics and metabolomics has uncovered the importance
of cellular metabolism in regulating the innate immune response during experimental Staphylococcus aureus
(SA) endophthalmitis. Notably, we observed significant impairment in the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 4
(GPX4) signaling, which plays a crucial role in reducing lipid peroxide accumulation and preventing ferroptosis
cell death. Ferroptosis, a newly discovered form of cell death linked to iron overload, is regulated by GPX4.
Surprisingly, the role of the GPX4/Ferroptosis axis in ocular infections has remained unexplored. Based on our
findings, we hypothesize that reduced GPX4 levels, combined with elevated iron levels during endophthalmitis,
contribute to ferroptotic cell death in the retina. In support, our preliminary data show, downregulation of GPX4,
an increased labile iron pool, excessive lipid peroxidation, and induced expression of ACSL4 in SA-infected
retina and cultured cells. Here, we will employ mouse genetic tools and pharmacological interventions to
elucidate the mechanisms underlying impaired GPX4 signaling (Aim 1), investigate the role of ACSL4 as the
final executor of ferroptosis (Aim 2), and test potential of nanoformulations to enhance GPX4 levels and reduce
ferroptosis as a novel approach to treat bacterial endophthalmitis (Aim 3). The knowledge gained from this
study into the regulation of ferroptosis during endophthalmitis and the development of therapeutic strategies
could have a significant impact not only on ocular infections but also on other eye diseases involving
ferroptosis. Ultimately, our work aims to contribute to the advancement of therapeutic interventions in the field,
offering new hope for preserving vision and improving outcomes in patients affected by these conditions."
10882777,"Abstract
 Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low
intellectual quotient, altered sleep cycles, obesity, and behavioral problems. The major gene contributing to
SMS is Retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI1). RAI1 is a chromatin-binding protein that participates in regulating
circadian clock genes. Every reported individual with SMS experienced circadian rhythm disturbances in
sleep/wake cycle such as daytime sleepiness, frequent nighttime awakenings, and decreased total sleep time
beginning in early childhood. SMS is also the only known genetic disorder with inverted circadian rhythm of
melatonin production. However, how RAI1 loss impairs circadian rhythms and cognitive function remains
unknown.
 A major roadblock to understanding the etiology of SMS is a lack of appropriate animal models that
recapitulate circadian rhythm disturbance. Most inbred laboratory mice, in which Rai1 was deleted, are
melatonin-deficient, thus inadequate for testing this hormone’s impact. Although Rai1-knockout (KO) mice
have provided important insights into the SMS etiology, including an apparent obesity phenotype due to
hyperphagia, Rai1-KO mice do not phenocopy sleep rhythm disturbance observed in SMS patients. Contrary
to the frequent night awakening and total sleep loss seen in SMS patients, Rai1-KO mice had even better
rhythms sleeping significantly more during the resting phase than wild-type mice. Two factors could have
contributed to the striking differences between Rai1-KO mice and SMS patients; 1) differential melatonin
productions and 2) distinct neural mechanisms that generate the opposite chronotypes between the nocturnal
laboratory mice and diurnal humans.
 To address the fundamental needs of diurnal models of RAI1 deficiency, we set out Rai1 gene targeting
in Nile grass rat, Arvicanthis niloticus, a diurnal rodent species. Nile grass rat is a well-established diurnal
rodent used in circadian research for almost 30 years. Leveraging on the genome sequence recently released
by the Genome10K project and CRISPR-mediated gene editing, we have generated Rai1-KO Nile grass rats,
the first genome-edited diurnal rodent to our knowledge. Importantly, the first Rai1-KO phenocopy the rhythm
disturbances as seen in SMS patients. This novel model allows us to elucidate the role of the Rai1 gene in
regulating circadian rhythms and cognitive function in diurnal animals that can be translated to humans. The
proposed project aims to thoroughly validate the specific gene deletion and perform initial behavioral
characterization of Rai1-deficient Nile grass rats, thereby providing the first diurnal animal system to study
SMS pathophysiology and a platform to test therapeutic interventions for this condition."
10882609,"Abstract: During the transition to extra-uterine life, mammalian hearts undergo a crucial metabolic shift that is
essential for neonatal hearts to adapt to normoxic conditions and the increased cardiac workload experienced
after birth. Proper metabolic transition is essential for establishing normal heart physiology. The long-term goal
of this project is to reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate this cardiac metabolic shift using
mouse models and ultimately translate our discoveries into clinical applications addressing inborn
cardiomyopathies.
 Mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A K119 (H2AK119Ub) is a major post-translational modification of
histone H2A, occurring in 5-15% of total H2A in mammalian cells. H2AK119Ub in the promoter region inhibits
RNA polymerase II elongation and acts as a repressive epigenetic mechanism to regulate key developmental
programs from drosophila to mammals. The precise level of H2AK119Ub is dynamically controlled by the balance
between ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. USP16 is a histone H2AK119Ub-specific deubiquitinase that de-
represses gene transcription. To test the role of USP16 in hearts, we specifically deleted Usp16 in the
myocardium. All mutant mice died within 3 days after birth and displayed severe myocardial wall anomalies. Our
subsequent two-hybrid and biochemical analyses revealed that Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) is a novel
USP16 interaction partner. NRF1 is a nuclear transcription factor that activates expression of the vast majority
of nuclear genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes.
 In support of the functional significance of the USP16-NRF1 interaction, our mRNA-Sequencing analysis
revealed that the pathway involved in OXPHOS was most significantly downregulated by myocardial deletion of
Usp16. We propose our central hypothesis that USP16 interacts with NRF1 to upregulate expression of nuclear
OXPHOS genes, supporting the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 1, we will test how deletion of Usp16
affects the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 2, we will test if OXPHOS genes are major direct regulatory
targets of USP16 in perinatal hearts using high-throughput approaches. In Aim 3, we will test the role of NRF1
in loading USP16 onto its target sites.
 This project will fill a major knowledge gap regarding the basic molecular mechanism underlying the
cardiac metabolic shift, which is critical for the proper transition to extra-uterine life. Our research will contribute
to the development of novel clinical applications aimed at OXPHOS-associated heart defects."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped many thousands of loci for complex
phenotypes, yet the manner by which such loci influence these phenotypes has proven elusive as the majority
of associations have unclear biological significance. Recent work has shown that GWAS associations are
enriched in transcription regulatory and enhancer regions. To leverage this information for studying complex
phenotypes, current studies map molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) with respect to multi-omics (i.e.,
epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabonomic) data and then incorporate molecular QTL in GWAS for
functional association studies. However, the impact of this approach is limited because existing methods usually
only analyze cis-acting molecular QTL and fail to consider the complicating effects that linkage disequilibrium
(LD) has on the mapping uncertainty of molecular QTL (disentangling true causal variation from nearby
correlated null variations). These limitations reduce the yield of functional association studies for considering
incomplete information about molecular QTL. This proposal will develop novel Bayesian statistical methods for
improved integrative multi-omics studies with real applications for validation. Our proposed methods have
potential to elucidate the genomic etiology of many complex phenotypes, by increasing the precision of mapping
molecular QTL and identification of risk genes. These novel Bayesian methods are built upon our recent work
and will account for prior knowledge for the parameters of interest through flexible prior distribution assumptions
and account for LD by jointly modeling genome-wide variants. (i) First, we will extend our recently proposed
Bayesian GWAS method to enable mapping both cis- and trans-acting (genome-wide) molecular QTL. We will
model different genetic architectures for cis- and trans-acting variants by assuming respective prior distributions.
Our previously derived scalable Bayesian inference algorithm will also be adapted for this new model. (ii) Next,
we will develop novel Bayesian methods for functional association studies, which will take the mapping
uncertainty of molecular QTL into account through flexible prior assumptions for variant effect sizes. (iii) Finally,
to make the most use of public summary-level multi-omics data of large sample sizes, we will derive new
Bayesian inference algorithms using only summary-level data while obtaining equivalent results as using
individual-level data for our proposed Bayesian methods. (iv) We will validate the proposed methods by applying
them to multi-omics and GWAS data from well-characterized older adults and relevant public summary-level
data to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and other complex phenotypes. My lab has access to the well-
characterized AD dementia related phenotypic, multi-omics, and GWAS data from older adults participating in
the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP) studies by Rush Alzheimer Disease
Center. We will release free software to implement the novel Bayesian statistical tools developed in this proposal."
10885086,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The candidate recently joined the staff at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the Cardiovascular
Performance Program (CPP), a unique group whose goals include conducting top-caliber human health and
performance research. A core mission of the CPP is to use endurance athletes as a model through which to
study the impacts of exercise on the cardiovascular system. This proposal applies this framework to evaluate
in detail on the impact of exercise on the aorta.
 This proposal emerged from the dual observations that a) myocardial adaptation to exercise training is a
well-established process that is felt to be adaptive rather than pathologic, while plasticity of the aorta has not
been documented, and b) endurance athletes with aortic enlargement are commonly encountered in clinical
practice. The candidate accordingly performed an initial study enrolling ~450 athletes and documenting an
elevated prevalence of aortic dilatation in this population as compared to established population norms. This
research proposal aims to define natural history, underlying physiology, and potential mechanisms underlying
this phenotype of aortic dilation in endurance athletes, with the overarching goal of helping to establish whether
this may represent an exercise-associated adaptation vs a novel form of overuse pathology.
 To achieve these goals, the applicant proposes to build off his prior work, leveraging the large cohort of
athletes whom he enrolled into the initial study. Longitudinal follow-up will be performed on athlete subjects
using echocardiography to mirror the index assessment. A subset will undergo detailed comparative
physiologic phenotyping with cardiopulmonary exercise testing, advanced echocardiographic techniques
including non-invasive evaluation of intracardiac and aortic blood flow patterns, vascular function profiling, and
detailed anatomic imaging with computed tomography. Where possible, testing will be performed at rest and in
response to physiologic provocation. Phenotypic profiles will be compared across athletes with and without
aortic dilatation and control subjects with aortic dilatation to assess physiologic differences and potential
mechanisms. Molecular evaluation will focus on plasma microRNA (miRNA), a class of molecules with well-
established exercise responsiveness and known mechanistic associations with aortic disease, and circulating
miRNA profiles will be assessed across these groups before and after exercise.
 The candidate’s career development plan includes advanced training in exercise physiology, cardiac
imaging and physiologic phenotyping, translational science, and research methodology, all under the
mentorship of a unique multidisciplinary team. The proposed science science will set the stage for future
studies to assess clinical outcomes in this population and integrate additional translational study of exercise-
associated aortic disease, which will form the basis of the candidate’s future R01 proposals. Over the course of
the K23 award, the candidate’s goal is to develop into an independent clinical and translational investigator."
10885013,"Abstract
Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death for women worldwide. Alarmingly, 85% of deaths occur in
low and middle-income countries (LMICs), as they lack the health care infrastructure required for cytology-based
screening, referral colposcopy diagnosis, and expert physicians, which have dramatically reduced the disease
burden in high income countries (HICs). Highly sensitive human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been effective
at reducing the incidence and mortality from cervical cancer when directly coupled with treatment; however, a
majority of women with HPV do not have cervical precancer, making HPV testing a poor triage test as
overtreatment carries risks like
hemorrhage and infertility.
Colposcopy followed by biopsy, the preferred triage
method in HICs, is untenable in most LMIC settings due to the cost of colposcopes and pathology facilities to
process and interpret biopsy results. To make matters worse, women are lost to follow up in LMIC settings when
a multi-visit model for cervical cancer screening is used. Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA), the World
Health Organization recommended triage test following HPV testing, has widely varied sensitivity and specificity
depending on the training level of the provider. In this proposal we are proposing a single visit model for precision
diagnosis and treatment in LMICs for cervical cancer prevention. Two major technological tools are needed to
implement this model: a low-cost method to perform imaging of the cervix and a machine learning algorithm to
automate diagnosis in the absence of a provider. We have previously developed the Pocket Colposcope, which
has shown high concordance with standard colposcopy at a fraction of the cost and validated it on thousands of
women across nearly every continent. We are now in the process of developing a state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network (CNN), called Colposcopy Automated Risk Evaluation (CARE), trained with Pocket colposcopy
images to automate the diagnostic process. Our current prototype algorithm has been highly successful at
classifying cervical pre-cancers from Pocket Colposcope images retrospectively. Our goals for this proposal are
fourfold: 1) improve and generalize the performance of Pocket CARE using >10,000 National Cancer Institute
(NCI) standard colposcopy images; 2) generate synthetic images to address domain shifts due to environmental
and personnel changes between different clinical sites; 3) embed the CARE algorithm into our existing software
to enable high quality image capture with the Pocket Colposcope for automated diagnosis 4) validate the
performance of Pocket CARE prospectively with a clinical study in Kisumu, Kenya, a site where Pocket CARE
would ultimately be adopted\. The deliverables for this proposal will be a fully validated Pocket CARE software
ready for scale to different clinical scenarios based on location-specific cultural contexts and infrastructure
and a comparative effectiveness of Pocket CARE to other publicly available algorithms and standard RI care."
10885016,"A distinguishing feature of the mammalian neocortex is its remarkable ability to change over a lifetime,
particularly during early development. The development of cortical fields and their connections is highly
dependent on the incoming sensory inputs they receive from the various sensory organs, such as the eyes and
the skin. This input, together with the unique combinations of sensory information available in the environment
shapes the neocortex to generate optimal behavior. We know from previous studies in our own laboratory that
very early loss of input from the eyes leads to massive changes in the brain, such that all of what would
normally be the primary visual cortex (V1) contains neurons that respond to somatosensory and auditory
stimulation. This reorganized V1 receives ectopic input from thalamic nuclei and cortical fields associated with
somatosensory and auditory processing. The current proposal addresses several fundamental questions
raised by these previous findings: 1) How does the age of onset of blindness differentially impact cortical
connectivity? 2) What are single-neuron response properties in reorganized V1 and S1, and does age of
blindness onset impact these properties? 3) What is the relationship between functional and anatomical
changes in V1 and S1 and compensatory behaviors mediated by the spared sensory systems? Our animal
model, the short-tailed opossum, is highly altricial at birth (equivalent to embryonic day 11 in the mouse),
allowing ex utero manipulations to the nervous system at developmental time points that would be in utero in
other mammals. In these experiments, bilateral enucleations will be made at specific developmental
milestones: 1) Prior to the onset of spontaneous activity in the retina, before retinal ganglion cells have
reached their subcortical targets, and before thalamocortical axons have innervated the neocortex; 2) When
spontaneous activity in the retina is present and retinogeniculate and thalamocortical axons have innervated
their targets; 3) Just after eye opening, when sensory driven activity in the retina is present and thalamocortical
and corticocortical connections have formed. Following enucleations, animals will be assessed at several
different time points. These studies are novel in scope in that they interrogate how the of age of vision loss
affects the reorganization of brain circuits and behavior, and if functional and anatomical changes to the
neocortex are linked to compensatory behavior. These data can direct therapeutic interventions (e.g. tactile
training based behavior), and even allow predictions for behavioral outcomes following retinal implants or gene
targeted therapies performed at different ages."
10885128,"Complexity and evolution of splicing-regulatory networks
Project Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) generates multiple transcript isoforms from single genes and contributes critically to the
molecular, cellular and phenotypic complexity of mammals. This process is tightly regulated by RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) which recognize specific regulatory elements in their target transcripts. A long-standing
hypothesis from the evolutionary perspective is that changes of AS regulation due to mutations in cis-regulatory
sequences provide a major driving force of speciation in mammals, including closely related species such as
human and Chimpanzee. Indeed, divergent AS events are pervasive in different mammalian species, as well as
in human populations as evident from widespread splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs). Despite remarkable
progress in studies of splicing-regulatory networks over the past decade, our understanding of the splicing code
remains very incomplete, leaving critical questions such as 1) which evolutionary splicing changes in different
species or in human populations have functional implications? 2) what are the underlying mutations/genetic
variations that led to the divergent splicing patterns? Building on our previous work on splicing-regulatory
networks, this research program aims to address these questions. We will develop computational methods and
experimental model systems to identify AS events under adaptive selection in specific lineages and map
mutations leading to changes in splicing-regulatory elements that underlie splicing divergence. Insights learned
from evolutionary changes that represent nature’s experiments will be leveraged to develop a more predictive
splicing code. In these studies, computational and experimental approaches including new technology
development are closely integrated by our multidisciplinary team. If successful, this study will provide
tremendous insights into the contribution of AS evolution to potential phenotypic differences among different
mammalian species, to health and disease in humans, and to fundamental understanding of RNA splicing
regulation."

This proposed career development award will provide Dr. Diana Alba MD with targeted mentored training
to ensure she develops into an independent researcher utilizing both experimental approaches and models, and
“omics” coupled with bioinformatic tools, to probe the mechanisms linking obesity to adipose tissue dysfunction
and diabetes. In certain individuals, adipose tissue is dysregulated in obesity, and this is an early mediator of
diabetes pathogenesis. However, precisely what underlies this dysfunction is not well-defined. Subcutaneous
white adipose tissue (sWAT) fibrosis is associated with insulin resistance, whereas the abundance of heat-
generating brown-like adipocytes in sWAT (“beiging”) is linked to metabolic health. The proposed research plan
aims to close key knowledge gaps regarding the reciprocal influences of sWAT fibrosis and beiging on insulin
sensitivity. To do so, the PI will take advantage of an innovative human cohort containing individuals with widely
divergent levels of both sWAT fibrosis and insulin sensitivity and use this resource to comprehensively probe
key cellular constituents and molecular pathways that shift sWAT away from being influenced by beige
adipocytes to developing fibrosis and insulin resistance. The PI aims to 1) identify transcriptional signatures
across cell types in the sWAT that coordinately modulate WAT fibrosis, body fat distribution, and glucose
homeostasis, 2) probe reciprocal influences of sWAT beige activity and fibrosis on insulin sensitivity via
transcriptional regulation, 3 ) use the BXD panel of recombinant inbred mice as an orthogonal genetic reference
to model divergent patterns of fat distribution and validate the mechanistic relevance of pathways and cell types
identified in the humans studies.
 The proposed 5-year career development and training plan incorporates strategically designed didactic
learning, mentored practical training, and career advising to complement the PI’s expertise in ways that are critical
to completion of her research and career goals. The specific career development goals outlined in this
application include developing mechanistic expertise in 1) adipose tissue biology through hands-on molecular
and computational biology training; 2) metabolic assessment of mouse models; 3) the human translation of
adipose tissue biology including multi-omics and metabolic phenotyping. She will be training at UCSF, a world-
class center for basic and translational research and an excellent environment for physician-scientist training
with experts in all aspects of the proposed training. She will be closely mentored by Dr. Suneil Koliwad, an expert
in inflammation, nutrition, and glucose/energy metabolism, and Dr. Shingo Kajimura, an expert in adipogenesis
and beige fat. The long-term goal is to provide Dr. Alba with the skills required to become an independent, R01-
funded faculty member working to identify adipose tissue disease-relevant mechanisms and risk markers for
diabetes, particularly in high-risk populations, and elucidate targets to specifically mitigate insulin resistance."

 Lauren D. Nephew MD, MA, MSCE's long-term career goal is to become an independent, externally
funded researcher and leader in developing multilevel interventions to reduce disparities in access to
treatments for liver disease and gastrointestinal malignancies. She has identified improving access to curative
therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a critical issue to address to achieve this goal. This proposal
describes a 4-year comprehensive program of training and mentored research for an academic career in
health services research with a special focus on advancing health care equity. This is in line with NIDDK's
commitment to combating health disparities. While Dr. Nephew has a strong background in epidemiology, this
K23 will provide key training in using human centered design research methods for intervention development,
randomized controlled behavioral trials, and implementation of interventions within health systems.
 Black patients with chronic liver disease are approximately 50% less likely than White patients to
receive curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even when presenting with early stage disease.
Reasons for disparities in mortality are in part related to failure to progress through the complex HCC care
continuum to access curative therapies as a result of the unequal distribution of social and structural
determinants of health (SSDOH). The HCC-EduLink intervention we propose to develop is designed to: a)
improve patients' HCC-related knowledge; b) screen patients for social needs and substance use and refer to
social work for linkage to local services; and c) use our multidisciplinary HCC tumor board to facilitate linkage

10883862,"TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a nuclear protein that has been implicated in several neurodegenerative
diseases, including Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD-TDP), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and
Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), among other age-related dementias. The
presence of TDP-43 aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells, particularly in oligodendrocytes
(OLs), is the neuropathological hallmark of FTLD-TDP, ALS, and LATE-NC. Similar to other misfolded proteins
(i.e., α-synuclein, β-amyloid and Tau), the transmission of pathogenic TDP-43 species between cells could
contribute to disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases. Our group has recently shown that
pathological TDP-43 derived from FTLD-TDP brain extracts can act as pathogenic seeds and induce the
formation of de novo TDP-43 pathology when injected in the brain of TDP-43 transgenic mice, and to a lesser
extent in wild-type mice (WT). Under this paradigm, TDP-43 pathology spreads throughout the brain in a regional
and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, as found in diseased human brains, TDP-43 pathology is present in
neurons and OLs. Despite several studies indicating that TDP-43 pathology in OLs is a common feature of
various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and FTLD-TDP, the consequences of TDP-43 pathology in
OLs remains unknown. The present research project aims to develop in vitro models to study the
pathophysiological consequences of TDP-43 pathology in OLs and evaluate the role of OLs in facilitating the
spread of TDP-43 pathogenic species between glial and neuronal cells."

This K08 Mentored Career Development Award will provide Dr. Da (David) Zhang with structured mentorship
and training towards a goal of developing an independent translational research program to study the genetics
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a lethal condition that affects 1 in 200 individuals over the age of
65 with limited treatment options and unresolved genetic influences. Building upon highly original research
publications, including the seminal discovery of KIF15 as a novel IPF candidate gene, Dr. Zhang proposes an
innovative framework for genetic discovery within endotypes of IPF. He conceptualizes three distinct
endotypes of IPF comprising individuals with 1) rare telomere-gene variants, 2) unexplained short telomere
lengths, and 3) normal telomere lengths. IPF patients with rare telomere-gene variants or short telomere
lengths are known to have worse mortality outcomes; thus this endotype definition is not only biologically
grounded but also clinically relevant. This K08 proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that distinct profiles of
common variants determine membership in three IPF endotypes and drive characteristic cell type-
specific gene expression. Leveraging existing whole genome sequencing (WGS) databases comprising
>2100 IPF cases and >12000 controls as well as biobanked lung tissue, this study proposes two independent
aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will focus on targeted and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of IPF
stratified by endotype to identify endotype-specific genetic risk factors. Aim 2 centers around single-nucleus
transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis of lung explant tissue of patients who have undergone genome
sequencing. For this aim, existing cryopreserved lung tissue with known donor genetics as well as
prospectively collected lung explants will be used. To complete his research objectives, Dr. Zhang has
assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team and crafted a robust training plan that includes participation in
an NIGMS R25-funded Innovative Program to Enhance Research Training (IPERT) already underway. Dr.
Zhang will complete training modules in 1) pulmonary genetics, 2) statistical genetics and functional genomics,
3) multi-omics methods, and 4) career development and research dissemination. This K08 proposal will
provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary skillset to launch an independent research career. The data generated
from this proposal will enable identification of high-priority disease pathways in IPF for future validation in R01
studies."
10887214,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, with an estimated 1.5 million Americans
receiving medical care each year for TBI. Patients with severe TBI require a decompressive craniectomy (DC),
which is a lifesaving surgery to remove a large segment of the skull and relieve elevated pressure in the brain.
The bone is then cryopreserved until brain swelling resolves (typically weeks to months), after which it is replaced
in a cranioplasty surgery. Pathophysiological processes, including impaired revascularization of the
cryopreserved bone, can lead to complete reconstruction failure, neurological deterioration, prolonged hospital
stays, and increased economic burden. The foundation for this proposal is based on recent mouse model studies
demonstrating that nonviral, nanotransfection based vasculogenic cell reprogramming can drive
revascularization of the brain in ischemic stroke, as well as peripheral nerves in sciatic nerve injury, with improved
functional outcomes in both instances. The current studies propose to utilize this technology for a new
application: calvarial bone revascularization. Specifically, the aims of this proposal are to 1) Characterize and
further develop a novel mouse model of autogenous cryopreserved cranioplasty after TBI and DC; and 2) Utilize
fibroblasts nanotransfected with the transcription factors Etv2, Foxc2, and Fli1 (EFF-TNT) to induce
vasculogenesis in autogenous cryopreserved calvarial bone in mice. Together, these studies will provide a
mechanistic understanding of cryopreserved calvarial bone healing after decompressive craniectomy and
explore an innovative approach to optimize healing.
This proposal presents a five-year mentored career development program that will provide critical mentorship
and position the candidate to transition from a primarily clinical role to an independent surgeon-scientist. The
candidate is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Ohio State University. The outlined proposal
builds on her previous clinical and research experience in calvarial reconstruction by integrating two new
domains of expertise represented by her primary mentor Dr. Paco Herson and mentorship team: 1)
Characterization of a novel animal model for studying pathophysiological processes in calvarial bone healing
and testing therapeutic approaches (Dr. Ching-Chang Ko), and 2) utilizing an innovative, nanotransfection cell-
based approach to revascularize bone and improve healing (Dr. Daniel Gallego-Perez). She is uniquely poised
to carry out the proposed studies based on her training and background. She is firmly committed to a career as
a translational surgeon-scientist and will have additional mentorship from Dr. Clara Lee to guide this aspect of
her career trajectory. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills
and experience necessary to become a leading independent investigator specializing in calvarial bone
reconstruction after decompressive craniectomy."

Severe storms, whether hurricanes or other storms with significant wind/precipitation, affect millions of
Americans each year, disrupt the delivery of healthcare, and increase the risk for health complications. While
severe storms may impact the care and outcomes of any cancer, addressing its impact on patients with breast
cancer, a highly prevalent cancer with a good overall survival when treated with high-quality care, is of high
public health significance. The primary research objective of this proposal is to recognize treatment disruption
and adverse health outcomes experienced by patients with breast cancer and to identify and prioritize
strategies to respond to health needs. In this study, we employ a mixed methods framework to accomplish the
following aims: (Aim 1) To assess the impact of severe storms on breast care, acute care services, and
mortality among patients with breast cancer, identify the most vulnerable populations, and evaluate potential
mediators for the three outcomes; (Aim 2) To describe disruptions in breast cancer care, community concerns,
perceived care barriers, and strategies to mitigate care disruptions and respond to health needs following
storms using depth interviews of key stakeholders; (Aim 3) To identify and prioritize targeted interventions to
mitigate disruptions in breast cancer care and respond to post-storm health needs through Delphi methods and
community engagement. I am supported by a mentorship team with expertise in oncology, climatology, health
services research, geospatial analysis, mixed methods, and disaster preparedness. I will link storm data,
including wind speed, flooding, and power outage, with breast databases to quantify the impact of severe
storms on the care and outcomes, identify mediators on the causal pathway and create geospatial maps to
identify impacted communities and health systems. Then I will conduct depth interviews with diverse
stakeholders in cancer care and disaster preparedness. Intervention mapping framework will be used to
identify strategies, which are then are assessed and prioritized by stakeholders during Delphi and a community
engagement working group. Through mentored training, education, and carrying-out this research proposal, I
will accomplish my training goals related to applying new quantitative methods, acquiring skills in qualitative
analysis and mixed methods, developing knowledge in implementation science and community engagement to
prepare strategies for intervention studies, and developing the skills and network for career independence as a
physician scientist. This proposal will provide the foundation for my independent physician-scientist career in
health services research focusing on environmental health threats and cancer care and outcomes. By
identifying vulnerable subgroups and potential mediators in Aims 1 and describing and prioritizing strategies in
Aims 2 and 3, this proposal will support the implementation and evaluation of the most promising strategies in
a future R01."
10888201,"Abstract: Sickle cell anemia (SCA) affects one in 1000 individuals worldwide, causing multi-organ ischemia,
long-term disability, and premature death, with a life expectancy of 42 years. Among its complications, cerebral
infarction and cognitive disability are prevalent and increase with age, with > 50% of young adults having silent
infarcts. Great headway has been made in pediatric SCA using neuroimaging screening tools to select high-risk
children, yet adults remain understudied. As the brain demands disproportionately more oxygen than other
organs at ~20% of total blood supply (but only 2% of body weight), low arterial oxygen content (CaO2) due to
anemia, places the sickle cell brain at lifelong risk of hypoxia. Thus, to try to meet cerebral oxygen demand
(CMRO2), the brain is continually under hemodynamic and metabolic “stress”, marked by elevated cerebral blood
flow and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), respectively. Findings from our previous grant cycle have helped
shape a new understanding of ischemic brain injury mechanisms in SCA. Importantly, specificity of both global
and regional OEF for stratifying stroke risk, at patient and tissue levels, suggests great promise for the clinical
utility of this imaging biomarker. We are now completing follow-up MRIs to determine if OEF longitudinally
predicts infarction in pediatric SCA. Two unexpected findings emerged from our results which warrant further
investigation. First, we expected that compensatory increases in CBF and OEF in SCA would serve to maintain
a normal cerebral oxygen metabolic demand; however, we found that resting CMRO2 is globally elevated in SCA.
This increase in oxygen demand parallels an elevation in total body resting energy expenditure in SCA, which is
postulated to be due to chronic inflammation. The finding is intriguing as an elevated cerebral oxygen demand
may increase ischemic vulnerability. Indeed, sickling and high blood velocity injure the endothelium inducing a
variety of leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Therefore, we hypothesize that neuroinflammation may promote
ischemia by increasing cerebral oxygen demand. Second, while we find global OEF elevation in adults with
SCA compared to controls, regional OEF elevation in the deep white matter is less prominent in adults compared
to children, suggesting a decrease in regional OEF with disease duration. It is postulated that capillary flow
heterogeneity (CFH) due to change in capillary microarchitecture leads to a reduction in local OEF. This is of
great interest in SCA because capillary morphology is disrupted and transit times are short due to anemia. Thus,
we hypothesize that progressive microvascular disease in SCA will disrupt capillary flow patterns, decreasing
oxygen supply, as an additional ischemic mechanism. In this renewal, we shift focus to adults with SCA, as a
growing and understudied population. First, we will determine if cerebral metabolic stress predicts ischemic brain
injury and cognitive decline. Next, we will employ novel MR approaches to investigate two mechanisms (neuro-
inflammation and CFH) which perturb cerebral oxygen metabolic physiology, to further our understanding of
oxygen supply-demand mismatch in SCA, each which can be developed as a novel therapeutic target."
10888202,"Harnessing the human monocyte system to improve surgical recovery
Over 30 million patients undergo a major surgery annually in the US. Patients’ recovery after surgery is highly
variable and can be severely compromised by complications, such as infections, prolonged pain, and functional
impairment. However, our current approaches to predict a patient’s recovery are anchored in clinical and
phenotypical data and perform poorly. Surgical injury produces a multi-cellular immune response that, when
dysregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes. Examining the human immune system in depth, in patients
undergoing surgery is a logical and promising strategy to identify biological signatures for risk prediction and to
reveal mechanisms that can be exploited to improve surgical recovery.
Our research program utilizes the high-dimensional immune monitoring of patients undergoing surgery to identify
modifiable immunological mechanisms that accurately predict a patient’s recovery. This MIRA proposal builds
on our extensive translational research indicating that immune responses contained in the human Monocyte
System (hMS) strongly correlate with pain resolution and functional recovery after major joint replacement
surgery. We will pursue three inter-related, but non-overlapping goals focusing on the hMS: First, we will assess
the phenotypic and functional dynamics of circulating monocytes in response to surgery to determine the role of
the hMS in the pathobiology of surgical recovery. Second, we will interrogate the hMS before surgery to
determine whether patients’ pre-surgical immune states determine the course of surgical recovery. Third, we will
use a reverse translational strategy using a pre-clinical mouse model of surgery to test whether “druggable”
immunological targets identified in humans can accelerate recovery. We will use the following innovative and
multidisciplinary strategies: 1) high-dimensional profiling of the hMS in response to surgery using single-cell
mass cytometry (including dynamic alterations in cell phenotype, homing properties and effector responses); 2)
identification of cellular, epigenetic and proteomic elements of a patient’s hMS, using an integrative analytical
pipeline developed by our group; 3) evaluation of new targets for selective modulation of monocyte signaling
responses in a mouse model that recapitulates hallmarks of the human immune response to surgery.
A major strength of this proposal is the study of trauma-related immunology in a pertinent patient population by
a clinician-scientist who has effectively pioneered high-content immune monitoring techniques at the bedside.
The current program focuses on pain and functional impairment after orthopedic surgery. However, we will study
fundamental mechanisms that are likely shared across many acute inflammatory conditions (e.g. other surgeries,
blunt trauma or traumatic brain injuries). As such, we will be able to pivot towards the integration of our findings
within the broader immunologic, metabolic, and neuro-hormonal responses to injury and the evaluation of other
adverse outcomes after traumatic injury, such as infections, sepsis, or neuro-cognitive impairment."
10888219,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although modern therapies have dramatically improved the outlooks for people living with HIV, they are unable
to cure infection, leaving these individuals burdened by a lifelong commitment to antiretroviral (ARV) medication.
For any given individual, maintaining lifelong adherence to medication can present substantial challenges.
Moreover, many people do not have access to these expensive medications - in particular those living in
resource-limited settings. It would therefore be of tremendous value to develop novel therapies that can either
cure HIV infection or drive it into remission (a state where levels of virus remain low or undetectable even when
one stops taking ARV medication). One approach to achieving either a cure or remission is to reactivate latent
(hidden) ‘reservoirs’ of virus and harness the immune system to reduce or eliminate these reservoirs. These ‘kick
& kill’ approaches often focus on cytotoxic T-cells (CTL), which are an arm of the immune system specialized in
eliminating virus-infected cells. While the ‘kick & kill’ strategy has shown promise in in vitro models of latency, it
has not yet been effective in clinical trials. In recent work, we have uncovered an additional barrier to eliminating
viral reservoirs by showing that HIV-infected cells are intrinsically resistant to CTL - even when they are forced
to show virus to the immune system by latency reversing agents (LRAs). Although this idea of intrinsic resistance
to CTL has not been widely considered in the context of HIV, it is well known as a factor that limits therapeutic
efficacy in cancer. In this grant application we propose to leverage cutting edge technologies to identify novel
mechanisms by which target cells resist elimination by CTL. These approaches are expected to yield a large
number of ‘hits’, for which we will perform high-resolution mechanistic characterizations. We will then study
samples from people living with HIV to determine which of these mechanisms of resistance play roles in HIV
persistence in vivo. Finally, we will directly test whether therapies targeting this resistance can allow CTL to kill
these ex vivo reservoir-harboring cells. We expect that the outcome of our study will be the identification of novel
targets for the development of therapies aimed at curing HIV infection or enabling remission. More broadly, we
anticipate that the mechanisms identified here will provide fundamental insights into the biology of CTL with
implications for cancer & other conditions."
10888220,"Bladder cancer (BCa) exhibits a striking sex bias: men are 3-5 times more likely than women to develop and die
from BCa. Even when known risk factors such as smoking, infection, occupational hazards, cultural and
environmental factors are corrected for, this phenomenon persists. Despite this long-standing clinical observation,
men and women still receive relatively similar treatments due to a lack of mechanistic understanding to derive
useful treatments based on biological sex. In this proposal, we seek to elucidate the mechanistic basis of sexual
dimorphism in tumor biology. It is well established that gonadal hormone effects (GHE), defined by gonad-
derived hormonal factors that drive sex disparities in BCa, are primarily mediated by male dominant androgens
and androgen receptor (AR). Recently, we reported an unexpected sex chromosome effect (SCE) that
independently contributes to the sexual dimorphism of BCa; we found that SCE is predominantly mediated by
lysine (K) demethylase 6a (KDM6A), which functions as a female-biased tumor suppressor gene in the bladder.
KDM6A demethylase is a versatile epigenetic regulator that controls histone methylations in both enzymatic
activity development and independent mechanisms. We will refer the sex-specific epigenome to as the sex
epigenome. We hypothesize that the sex epigenome, programed by KDM6A directly and AR indirectly, controls
sexual dimorphism in gene expression and BCa. We designed three specific aims to test this hypothesis: 1) to
determine whether KDM6A shapes directly the sex epigenome and regulates the local bioavailability of sex
hormones in the bladder; 2) to determine whether AR opposes the KDM6A-dependent sex epigenome in the
bladder; and 3) to determine whether the sex epigenome differentially regulates genes during bladder
carcinogenesis. Success of the proposal will catalyze the identification of sex-biased genes and regulatory
elements for the design of sex-specific BCa screening and treatment. Results from our proposed studies will
also advance the mechanistic understanding behind greater BCa incidence in males and lead future efforts to
prevent and treat BCa according to a patient's biological sex. Because male dominance in cancer incidence and
mortality is observed across most non-reproductive cancer types, an improved understanding of sexual
dimorphism in BCa will also have widespread implications on these cancers."

10887049,"Summary: While anti-ABO(H) antibodies represent the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and
transplantation, variation in anti-ABO(H) antibody levels and overall specificity may play a critical role in dictating
the clinical consequence of these naturally occurring antibodies on adverse events following ABO(H)
incompatible transfusion and transplantation. However, the factors that regulate this variation, and development
of anti-ABO(H) antibodies in general, remain relatively unknown. Given this, our long-term goal is to define key
factors that regulate the production and clinical outcome of naturally occurring anti-ABO(H) antibodies. Our
central hypothesis is that innate immune factors target blood group expressing microbes, which shapes the
specificity and clinical significance of naturally occurring anti-ABO(H) blood group antibodies. Our results also
demonstrate that a series of innate immune lectins called galectins possess the ability to specifically bind and
kill blood group positive (BG+) microbes through engagement of their carbohydrate BG antigens. Using a new
preclinical model that leverages the murine equivalent of ABO(H) blood group antigens, we have also shown
that these same microbes can drive the formation of anti-BG antibodies capable of causing ABO(H) incompatible
hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Microbial populations within galectin knockout strains demonstrate
significantly increased numbers of BG+ microbes and exposure of recipients to the non-metabolizable pan
galectin inhibitor, thiodigalactoside (TDG), likewise results in increased colonization by BG+ microbes. However,
galectin absence or inhibition blunts the ability of BG+ microbes to stimulate anti-blood group antibody formation,
suggesting that galectin-mediated microbial killing enhances anti-blood group antibody formation. Importantly,
we have also shown that galectins do not target all BG+ microbes equally. Thus, a dynamic interplay between
the composition of distinct blood group positive microbes in an individual’s microbiota and the ability of galectins
to target these microbes exists that may ultimately shape the specificity and overall levels of anti-BG antibodies.
As studies to address this intriguing possibility require a unique combination of expertise, I will leverage my
current expertise in glycobiology and microbiology with key training in immunology and transfusion medicine,
obtained during the K99 phase of this proposal. I will also leverage our new preclinical model and series of
recently developed glycan microarrays and build on these tools with establishment of key galectin KO lines and
continued microarray expansion to address the following specific aims. Aim 1: Define the role of galectins in
shaping anti-blood group antibody levels. Aim 2: Define the consequence of anti-blood group antibody
repertoire on HTRs. Completion of these aims will provide unprecedented insight into the fundamental and
previously unrecognized role of the interplay between innate immune factors and BG+ microbes, and how it
shapes the most common immunological barrier to transfusion and transplantation. Furthermore, these studies
will provide important foundation for the launch of my independent career during the R00 phase of this proposal."
10891581,"Project Summary
 A fundamental question in developmental biology concerns the origin and control of patterns and shapes,
also known as morphogenesis. Multicellular signaling networks, encoded in genetic networks, underlie the
normal development of embryos and drive their morphogenesis. Paradigmatic example is the periodic
segmentation of mesoderm into somites, the precursors of the vertebrae, during vertebrate development.
Changes in genes, effector proteins, and cellular environments can lead to altered embryonic development as
seen in congenital disorders. To cure diseases we need to understand how genes control cells at multiple
scales and how groups of cells form coherent, functional tissues and organs.
 The last years have witnessed a boom in discoveries in developmental biology with single-cell sequencing,
microfluidics, optics, increased computational power leading to unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of the
multiscale dynamics of morphogenetic systems, from molecules to cells to whole embryos.
 While these advancements have produced detailed roadmaps of the events orchestrated during develop-
ment, we still lack a clear picture of which cellular networks drive collective morphogenetic programs. The
classical forward and reverse genetic perturbative screenings, and even modern perturbative tools like
optogenetics, still mainly focus at the level of the gene(s) or single signaling pathways. This makes it
challenging to infer causal relationship between complex multicellular networks and developmental transitions.
New perturbative tools are needed that could construct similar complexity as the ones observed in vivo. As
these complex networks in vivo are based on cell-cell and cell-environment communication pathways, we need
controllable versions of those pathways that we can (i) link in complex synthetic networks, (ii) use to control
endogenous developmental pathways. Such a system would enable the introduction of precise and complex
spatiotemporal perturbations at the level of the networks instead of the gene(s), ultimately delivering increased
understanding of the relationship between complex networks and resulting developmental transitions.
 In our lab we develop synthetic cell-cell and cell-ECM pathways, connect them in networks, and use them to
investigate developmental processes. Here we propose to (i) use these tools to investigate the mechanistic
contribution of Notch signaling to the formation and propagation of signaling waves in the presomitic
mesoderm and, (ii) develop new tools for cell-ECM communication, inspired by developmental signaling. We
expect to enter a cycle of toolsàtestàanswersànew questionsànew tools.
 These studies will advance the field of developmental biology by shedding light on the behavior and logic of
multicellular systems and how complex networks enable control across scales of space and time. Gaining
insight and tools to direct developmental cell populations would have widespread relevance for the treatment of
developmental defects and our capacity to control the growth of tissue and organs in a dish."

incorporates several tiers of mentoring and focused time on oral and written presentations, with a culmination
in the production of career development grant. This training program is supported by an excellent
environment for neuroscience research and education in the UCLA Neurology Department. The department
has been a top ten NIH funded neurology department, and has a large clinical and basic research
faculty with diverse and well-funded programs. The residency program is relatively large (9 per year) with
flexibility to place selected residents in a research program, and has a track record of training many
academic neurologists. The proposed education program takes advantage of the substantial neuroscience
community within the Neurology Department and allied departments to have a large and scientifically
diverse group of mentors with great depth of research and past training experience. By serving to integrate

Substantial research effort has uncovered a critical role for chronic inflammation in the development of insulin
resistance, a hallmark of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Even with this discovery, no successful anti-inflammatory
therapeutics have been developed, and research has stagnated with a focus on characterizing adipose tissue
inflammation in mouse models of T2D. Importantly, the initiator of chronic inflammation in T2D remains
unknown. Type 2 Diabetes presents with autoantibodies against a wide array of self-proteins, but protein
screens for antibody reactivity have not discovered initiators of T2D inflammation. Remarkably, not all
autoantigens in T2D are protein. We have identified lipid autoantigens in T2D that have been completely
overlooked, likely due to the proteins which present lipid antigen, Group 1 CD1 molecules, not being expressed
in mice. This lack of expression has left a gaping hole in our understanding of lipid antigens in immunological
homeostasis and disease, especially T2D. To remedy this issue, we will use transgenic mice which express
human CD1 molecules and in vitro models of human immune responses to understand lipid-mediated immune
function in T2D. The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish a new scientific direction with the broad
long-term purpose of understanding the role of lipids in pro-inflammatory responses, T2D, and autoimmune
diseases. This proposal tests the overarching hypothesis that lipid antigen presentation is a key mechanism by
which chronic inflammation in T2D is initiated. This innovative and novel investigation of lipid antigen
presentation in T2D combines use of human blood samples, transgenic and humanized mice, single cell RNA
sequencing, multiparameter cytokine analysis and flow cytometry, coupled with computational methods that
allow for a systems biology approach to antigen discovery and hypotheses testing. In research Area 1, we will
assess lipid antigen dependent activation of T cell responses. We will use humanized mice and human blood
samples to interrogate the impact of these lipid antigens on T cell function in vitro (CD1 tetramer loading) and
in vivo (high fat diet). In research Area 2, we will target lipid antigen presentation to prevent and treat T2D. The
capacity of neutralizing antibodies targeted against group 1 CD1 molecules and lipid autoantigens to inhibit
pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted from human immune cells and to prevent and treat disease in transgenic
mice will be assessed. In research Area 3. Lipid autoantigen discovery in T2D will be performed with a novel
3D printed lipid microarray for antibody profiling. This proposal has the potential to redefine T2D as an
autoimmune disease driven by lipid antigen presentation and completely change the strategies for
management of disease and therapeutic development. Outcomes of this proposal will allow for the
identification of specific inflammatory pathways that can be targeted for disease treatment."

pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted from human immune cells and to prevent and treat disease in transgenic
mice will be assessed. In research Area 3. Lipid autoantigen discovery in T2D will be performed with a novel
3D printed lipid microarray for antibody profiling. This proposal has the potential to redefine T2D as an
autoimmune disease driven by lipid antigen presentation and completely change the strategies for
management of disease and therapeutic development. Outcomes of this proposal will allow for the
identification of specific inflammatory pathways that can be targeted for disease treatment."

Domestic violence (DV) is a widespread global public health concern, with higher prevalence rates in low -and-
middle-income countries (LMIC), such as India, where a staggering 41% of Indian women report lifetime DV.
Although DV causes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, the unmet needs for mental health
care for women are massive. Drivers of this care gap include 1) a lack of treatments relevant for DV (i.e.,
continuous traumatic stress conditions), 2) a shortage of skilled providers, 3) high drop-out following initial
treatment sessions. The objective of this 5-year mixed-methods proposal is to develop and test a novel low-
intensity psychosocial intervention delivered to DV survivors in primary health clinics in Goa, India, by non-
specialists through task-sharing—a critical strategy that successfully addresses treatment gaps for mental health
in many LMIC. Dr. Patel (PI) will develop and test a brief intervention that is evidence-informed, culturally
acceptable, and brief using a single-session intervention (SSI) format, which are clinically effective for many
disorders among youth yet remain less-studied among adults. The SSI will target emotion regulation to build
resilience rather than actively processing trauma memories, as DV may be ongoing for many women who remain
married. Dr. Patel will then capitalize on the penetration of smartphones in India (61%) to sustain the clinical
effects of the SSI with ecological momentary intervention (EMI) follow-up via interactive chatbot to
encourage skills practice in daily life. In Aim 1, Dr Patel will design the intervention (Aim 1a: SSI development;
Aim 1b: EMI development). In Aim 2, she will conduct a case series (n=24) to optimize the content and delivery
processes of the intervention. In Aim 3, Dr Patel will pilot a randomized clinical trial (N=90) with three arms (SSI
alone; SSI+EMI; and enhanced usual care alone) to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the two
interventions and assess their preliminary effectiveness. She will base her research at Sangath, a world-
renowned community-based mental health research organization in India where she conducted her Fogarty
fellowship. The project research aims are integrated into Dr. Patel’s training aims to fill critical gaps in (1)
designing scalable psychosocial interventions for trauma-exposed people, (2) mastering the design and
deployment of mobile health (mHealth) support tools, such as EMI, to supplement in-person care, and (3) leading
RCTs with high ecological validity in ‘real-world’ public health settings. The exceptional training environment at
the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, world-class mentoring team with complementary expertise for all
training goals, and Dr. Patel’s long-standing partnership with the field site foster the success of this study. This
K23 award will support Dr. Patel in gaining the methods expertise and preliminary data to pursue an independent
research career. Her long-term goal is to develop, evaluate, and scale a suite of psychosocial services for trauma
survivors in low-resource settings."

This D43 grant application aims to sustainably strengthen the research capacity of the Universidad Javeriana in
Bogotá, Colombia with an emphasis on training in-country experts to develop and conduct research focused on
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Our application is in response to NOT-AG-21-027 from the
National Institute of Aging (NIA) aimed at encouraging the development of training and research programs
related to ADRD in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). We build on existing research collaborations,
funded by the National Institute of Aging, in the Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin
America (ReDLat, R01-AG-057234) between UCSF and Universidad Javeriana. We also expand UCSF’s Global
Brain Health Institute’s (GBHI) eight-year engagement in Colombia by training five Atlantic Fellows for Equity in
Brain Health in a non-residential fashion to advance ADRD research, education, and care. Three pillars of
activities described in this application will be used to increase ADRD research capacity for the university framed
around a new Doctorate of Neurosciences program led by MPI, Santamaría-García. First, we will augment
programing for a new Doctorate of Neuroscience degree with further coursework in statistics and grant writing.
A full-time statistician at Universidad Javeriana will amplify the success of this program. We will support the most
promising doctorate students with stipends and seed grants to free up time needed to advance their research.
Second, we will increase capacity of the early-career mentoring pool through a non-residential experience
provided by GBHI and will provide access to seed grant funding for early-career, patient-oriented faculty at
Universidad Javeriana. Most seed grants to faculty will be offered in year 1 to create a platform for research
projects that postdoctorate students can join and to provide preliminary data for NIH applications, a core metric
of success. The non-residential experience at GBHI will be 12 months in duration and will include coursework
around ADRD, leadership, mentoring, and skills such as grant writing. Resources for these alumni include access
to USD 25,000 pilot grants program. Finally, we will increase in-country networking and research exchange
opportunities, in collaboration with the Universidad de Antioquia which has a robust NIH-supported research
program around early-onset, dominant-inherited AD. An in-country annual scientific exchange and workshop will
fortify these collaborations. In all, the proposed work aims to substantially fortify Universidad Javeriana’s
research capacity for ADRD research in a manner that strengthens the renewal of this grant in five years led by
MPIs in Colombia."

 Nasal sinus disease is one of the most common medical conditions in the US, affecting an
estimated 13% of adults, or some 30 million people, and responsible for $5.8 billion in health
care expenditures annually (National Health Interview Survey 2009, CDC). Nasal obstruction
and smell loss are two of the major symptoms of the disease; however, the field currently lacks
a clear, objective understanding to the mechanisms causing these symptoms, which thwarts
effective treatment. For example, patients’ complaints of nasal obstruction correlate poorly or
inconsistently with objective measurements of actual physical obstruction. Olfactory loss is
widely believed to be induced in part by airflow blockage that prevents sufficient ambient odor
from reaching the olfactory region; however, no tool has been able to evaluate and target such
conductive causes. Without validated clinically tools, current treatment of these symptoms relies
primarily on the patient’s subjective feedback and the doctor’s personal training and experience,
which can lead to inconsistent and unsatisfactory outcomes.
 Through a series of preliminary studies, we demonstrated that the symptom of nasal
obstruction may be caused not by obstruction per se but by poor sensing of airflow during
breathing, through the trigeminal cool-sensitive (TRPM8) pathway, and that such sensing may
be worsened by impaired trigeminal function. However, which trigeminal sensory regions and
what nasal airflow anomalies are most critical to disrupt the sensing of airflow are still unknown.
To establish a more direct link, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will examine the critical trigeminal
sensory regions and critical nasal airflow distortions that may better predict airflow perception
and obstruction symptoms. TRPM8 is a major component of the cool afferent pathway that is
also activated chemically, which offers a unique dual investigatory tool to broaden our
understanding of chemosensory function in nasal sinus disease and open up new therapeutic
directions. So in Aim 2, we will investigate the efficacy of a novel patent-pending “nasal aid” to
improve patients’ symptoms by modulating nasal airflow and trigeminal sensory feedback and to
improve future treatment outcomes based on what we have learned and will continue to learn
about the airflow trigeminal perception mechanisms.
 We have also shown in a series of published studies that complicated relationships exist
between nasal obstruction and olfactory function. Based on these findings, in Aim 3 we propose
to explore how to potentially improve olfactory function in patients with likely conductive
olfactory loss, by enhancing nasal odor/air flow to the olfactory region (another pending US
patent), analogous to hearing aids or eye glasses that amplify peripheral sensory stimuli.
 The outcomes from this research may potentially validate several novel clinical tools to
better identify factors that most affect patients’ obstructive symptoms and to relieve symptoms
by modulating nasal airflow patterns. The ultimate goal is to assist patients and clinicians in
planning effective, well-informed, personalized treatment strategies, potentially saving millions
of health care dollars annually while improving patient satisfaction."

This proposal details a five-year research and training plan with a scientific focus on defining the role of Notch
signaling in driving pathogenic synovial fibroblast expansion in joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
The candidate spearheaded high-dimensional profiling studies of RA synovia that identified expansion of
pathological sublining fibroblasts in RA (Mizoguchi, Slowikowski, Wei et al., Nature Communications, 2018
and Zhang*, Wei*, Slowikowski*, Fonseka*, Rao et al, Nature Immunology, 2019). The PI recently
discovered that Notch signaling is a key regulator of pathogenic sublining fibroblasts differentiation. The long-
term objective of the proposed study is to define how Notch signaling regulate pathological functions that
contribute to RA pathology and determine if Notch receptors can be therapeutically targeted to treat arthritis.
The specific aims proposed here utilize three complementary approaches to define how Notch regulates
synovial fibroblast differentiation and function in RA. Aim 1 will identify Notch receptors critical for fibroblast
differentiation towards a sublining fibroblast phenotype. Aim 2 interrogates the impact of global and fibroblast-
specific Notch inactivation on synovitis in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Aim 3 examines
transcriptional control of Notch-driven fibroblast pathology.
Using a combination of single cell technology, patient-derived tissues, and mouse model of arthritis, this study
will provide the candidate with new training in bioinformatics, gene editing, and transgenic mouse model. The
candidate’s immediate career development goals are to acquire expertise in bioinformatics and computational
biology to guide analysis of single cell RNAseq data. A specific career development plan tailored to the
candidate’s training needs is described by both the candidate and the mentors: Dr. Michael Brenner MD, an
expert in fibroblast biology and rheumatoid arthritis, and Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri MD PhD, an expert in
single cell bioinformatics.
The PI is an MD/PhD rheumatologist whose long-term goal is to become a tenure-track faculty focusing on
developing novel treatments for rheumatic diseases. The proposed studies, training plan, and exceptional
environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School will pave the way for the PI’s
transition to an independent investigator and a leader in arthritis research."

Improving HIV and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) management and implementation for criminal justice (CJ)-
involved individuals requires effective approaches to screening, linkage and adherence to integrated services
across community agencies and service providers. Community reentry represents a critical opportunity to link
individuals to HIV prevention and treatment and OUD service providers. In response to RFA DA-20-028, our
proposed study called Addressing risk through Community Treatment for Infectious disease and Opioid use
disorder Now (ACTION) among justice-involved populations, is a 5-year Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-
Implementation RCT that compares two models [Patient Navigation (PN) or Mobile Health Unit (MHU) service
delivery] of linking individuals recently released from prison and jail to the continuum of community-based HIV
and OUD prevention and treatment service cascades of care. A total of 864 CJ-involved individuals who are
being released to 2 CT communities (New London and Windham/Tolland Counties) & 2 TX communities
(Dallas and Tarrant Counties) with pre-arrest histories of opioid/injection drug use and are living with or at-risk
of HIV will be randomized to receive at post-release either: a) a PN system for care, wherein patient navigators
will link study participants to community-based service providers during the 6-month post-release intervention
period; those without HIV will be provided access to PrEP services, and those living with HIV will receive
access to ART services, or b) services delivered via a MHU, wherein study participants will be linked to a MHU
within their community where they will receive integrated PrEP/ART, MOUD, harm reduction services on the
MHU during the 6 month post-release intervention period. There are 2 specific aims: Aim 1 (Intervention
Effectiveness): To compare the effectiveness of the use of PN vs. MHU service delivery on participant length
of time to taking initial post-release PrEP (prevention)/ART (treatment) medication within 6 months following
release from custody. Secondary outcomes will examine the continuum of PrEP and HIV care outcomes,
including (but not limited to) the following additional measures: HIV viral suppression for PLH, PrEP
adherence, HIV risk behaviors; HCV measures such as HCV testing & linkage to treatment; sexually
transmitted infection (STI) incidence (GC/ Chlamydia/ Syphilis and HBV); and primary medical care
appointments. Importantly, we will also assess OUD and SUD-related measures: OUD/ SUD diagnoses,
MOUD prescription receipt &retention, opioid & stimulant use, & overdose incidents. Aim 2 (Implementation):
To evaluate PN and MHU feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Primary implementation outcomes include
feasibility (health care utilization impact among released individuals, contributions of interagency workgroup
members on outcomes); acceptability (participant satisfaction, perceived usefulness); sustainment (continued
utilization), and costs required to implement and sustain the approaches as well as to scale-up in additional
communities. Barriers to service access across the community provider spectrum will be assessed as well."
10890125,"Enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy for brainstem glioma by targeting ATM
Project Summary/Abstract
Brainstem gliomas are devastating pediatric brain tumors. Brainstem gliomas include “diffuse midline gliomas
with H3K27M mutation” in the 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the CNS, and
includie tumors previously referred to as “diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas” or DIPG. Brainstem gliomas are
uniformly lethal to the patients. Radiation therapy is thought to be the only effective treatment for these
tumors, providing temporary relief from symptoms and from tumor progression. However, brainstem gliomas
inevitably progress after radiation therapy and result in death of the patient resulting in a median survival of
less than one year. New strategies are needed to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy to improve patient
survival. One promising investigational therapeutic strategy is to radiosensitize tumors by inactivating the
serine/threonine kinase Ataxia Telangiactasia Mutated (ATM). ATM is the master sensor for DNA damage,
and orchestrates the DNA damage response after cells are damaged by ionizing radiation or other DNA
damaging agents. ATM inactivation dramatically radiosensitizes a genetically engineered mouse model of
brainstem glioma. When ATM is inactivated in the tumor cells of our mouse model of brainstem glioma,
radiation therapy is particularly effective and extends median overall survival of the mice by approximately
threefold compared to mice bearing tumors with intact ATM. However, the specific cell populations that are
radiosensitized by ATM inactivation, and the mechanisms by which ATM inactivation radiosensitizes brainstem
gliomas, is unknown. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechansisms by which ATM inactivation can
radiosensitize brainstem gliomas is needed to enable the rational design of combination therapies that
combine ATM inhibition, radiation therapy, and other novel epigenetic and immunologic therapies to maximize
survival of patients with brainstem gliomas. Here, I will test the hypothesis that ATM inactivation specifically
radiosensitizes a population of progenitor-like tumor cells in our genetically engineered mouse model of
brainstem glioma. In parallel with this work, I will dissect type I interferon signaling pathways that are
contribute to radiosensitivity when ATM is inactivated. These experiments will map the tumor
microenvironment of a mouse model of brainstem glioma at single cell resolution for the first time. They will
also credential a genetically-engineered mouse model of brainstem glioma with an intact immune system for
preclinical investigations of immunotherapeutic approaches. Additionally, the proposed work will provide me
with critical expertise in genetically engineered mouse models and in immunologic investigations that will help
me transition to a productive independent investigator."

A fundamental aspect of the success of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a human pathogen is the
ability to successfully transmit and infect new hosts. The mechanisms underlying transmission
are complex, with both bacterial and host factors playing important roles. It would be expected
the capacity is sense and response to the dynamic environment of the mammalian host is
critical for transmission, however the regulation underscoring this process remains poorly
understood. We hypothesize transmission is controlled via a specific, uncharacterized two-
component regulatory system (TCS11). This TCS has atypical operon structure for
pneumococcal TCSs, whereby two small hypothetical proteins and a putative transporter are in
the same operon and co-transcribed with TCS11. Preliminary data suggests is this operon is in
fact a TCS coupled to a bacteriocin secretion system that facilitates transmission via targeting
the resident bacterial flora, enabling pneumococcal transmission. We hypothesize that TCS11
mediates pneumococcal transmission via coordination of transmission factor gene expression
coupled with bacteriocin production to effectively compete against the respiratory microbiota at
the initial stages of epithelial colonization."
10887142,"Although immune checkpoint blockade has transformed therapeutic options for lung cancer, its efficacy
differs widely even between patients with remarkably similar disease, and while few have lifelong remissions,
the majority relapse after several months. Numerous clinical studies and pre-clinical mouse models have
demonstrated that certain compositions of mammalian gut microbiota (harboring particular bacteria) as well as
certain largescale manipulations (such as fecal transplant) can provide dramatic anti-tumor immunity in tissues
far removed from the intestine. As researchers heed this phenomenon, there are continued reports of various
“efficacious” bacteria. However, the mechanism by which any one of these gut-restricted commensals is able
to elicit an immune response in a distant tumor remains unknown. We do not appreciate in which anatomy the
host immune system is first provoked by the microbiota—is it locally within the mucosa, within the tumor
microenvironment itself, the draining lymph node, or elsewhere? We also do not know whether the microbiota
directly re-program cytotoxic T cells, whether they indirectly improve antigen presentation, or whether any
number of cells that participate upstream of the anti-tumor response are the first to be triggered.
 We have set up a reductionist model in our preliminary work to clarify this, wherein gut colonization with a
commensal Bacteroides leads to striking anti-tumor responses in immunogenic lung tumor implants. The
phenotype is T cell-dependent, and it is strong enough to persist even in the absence of exogenous
immunotherapy. We also find a closely related but distinct Bacteroides species, which is capable of similarly
colonizing the gut; however, it does not render any anti-tumor effect, and so it serves as a control comparator.
 Furthermore, bioengineering collaborators have established a “next-generation parabiosis” system, such
that mice housed in separate cages can each have their vasculature cannulated, and microfluidics can
continuously exchange blood flow. Remarkably, we find that a tumor-bearing mouse lacking gut colonization
will exhibit anti-tumor efficacy once it exchanges blood with a colonized mouse. Therefore, we wish to ask:
through which blood-borne component is efficacy transferred, and which host cell is first triggered?

Static human biomolecular atlases miss dimensionality that is critical for establishing the healthy condition. We
are uniquely positioned with rare resources and expertise to fill in these dimensions and enhance the healthy
human ovary HuBMAP data. Here, we will contribute the developmental dimension by defining the change in
interstitial cells across the pubertal transition; we will create the spatial dimension by probing the biochemical
and physical cues of the extracellular matrix (ECM) across anatomical compartments and functional cell unit
neighborhoods, and we will create the temporal dimension by investigating the changes in functional cell units
during ooplasm maturation and hormone production. Without these added dimensions, the HuBMAP datasets
are less effective in identifying and understanding disease modalities. Our long-term goal is to increase the utility
of the ovary atlas using existing and new datasets to inform regenerative medicine technologies that improve
the safety, efficacy and longevity of fertility and hormone restoration options for patients with premature ovarian
insufficiency (POI), a disease that occurs in approximately 1% of women in the USA. Individuals with POI have
a reduced quality of life and life expectancy of ~ 2 years shorter from comorbidities that include cognitive and
cardiovascular diseases. We will incorporate data from the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) HuBMAP Tissue
Mapping Center (TMC) and the University of Michigan (UM) Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Human Cell Atlas (HCA)
multiome maps of healthy adult ovaries. The Vanderbilt University Biomolecular Multimodal Imaging Center
(BIOMIC) developed imaging and biocomputational analysis pipelines that enable 3D multimodel reconstruction
and molecular profiling. Additionally, we have generated ECM and associated protein maps on model and human
ovaries, in collaboration with the Northwestern University (NU) HuBMAP Rapid Technology Implementation (RTI)
center. Finally, we have developed engineering tools, such as scaffolds that support ovarian follicles and
protocols to make ovarian hormone-producing cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These
resources and collaborations will provide valuable tissue and functional unit insights and, combined with our
expertise in tissue engineering, will enable us to reverse engineer the extracellular neighborhood that supports
ovarian follicle growth to improve fertility and hormone restoration options. We will (1) add developmental and
spatial dimensions to the human ovary atlas to identify changes in the neighborhood that impact folliculogenesis,
(2) demonstrate the utility of the HuBMAP data and tools to address important biological questions within the
ovary and reverse engineer a neighborhood that supports follicle growth, and (3) reverse engineer a personalized
ovarian hormone-replacement therapy from human iPSCs by defining and validating the response of cells to
ECM environments. By achieving these milestones, we will add to the functionality of the HuBMAP ovary atlas,
demonstrate the utility of these datasets, and develop pipelines and technologies for future regenerative
technologies that may be developed from other HuBMAP tissue atlases."

Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, accounting for around 47 deaths per day.
Promisingly, five PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies were approved for bladder cancer in
2016. Although these ICB treatments have achieved durable clinical responses in a subset of patients (15-25%),
the majority of patients have still not benefitted from this therapy. This clinical urgency to extend the benefits of
ICB to more patients has led to a need to investigate tumor intrinsic mechanisms underlying resistance. Tumor-
promoting inflammation, a hallmark of cancer pathogenesis, is known to contribute to cancer growth in multiple
ways including restraining antitumor immunity. We discovered a gene signature from pre-treatment tumor
associating with myeloid cells that is enriched in inflammation and innate immune genes and predictive of poor
ICB outcomes and survival in two ICB clinical trials. I plan to follow up on this work and dissect the innate immune
landscape of bladder cancer and investigate mechanisms of myeloid-cell mediated resistance to ICB therapy.
Aim 1 seeks to define the landscape of untreated bladder tumors and provide insight into the immune cell
subsets underlying ICB resistance. I will construct a transcriptomic and molecular atlas of bladder cancer at a
single-cell resolution, a resource that does not currently exist. I will build atlases of patients’ tumor, blood, and
urine using single-cell RNA sequencing, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing
(CITEseq), spatial transcriptomics, and O-link proteomics and analyze them using Seurat and other R-based
tools. I plan to resolve myeloid cells expressing this resistant gene signature and define their cellular interactions.
In Aim 2, I will delve into the transcriptional pathways in myeloid cells that are contributing to ICB resistance. We
have identified NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β signaling in tumor monocyte-macrophages (mono-
MΦs) as candidate pathways promoting tumor inflammation and progression. I will model these mono-MΦs by
differentiating peripheral blood monocytes into MΦ using GM-CSF and M-CSF under hypoxic conditions with IL-
1β and NLRP3 inflammasome activators., I will test effects on adaptive immunity by co-culturing these mono-
MΦs with activated autologous CD8+ T cells. I will also use this model to test drug candidates known to modulate
IL-1β and NLRP3 inflammasome activity as potential combinatorial treatments with ICB in bladder cancer.
This proposal combines direct ex vivo single cell genomics with in vitro functional experiments for a thorough
interrogation of the innate immune contribution to ICB resistance in bladder cancer. Combined, these aims will
elucidate innate immune pathway driven resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB therapy in bladder cancer, which can be
used to identify critical predictive clinical biomarkers and inform new combinatorial treatment strategies."

Roughly 80% of persons living permanently in US nursing homes have a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD). They often experience avoidable hospitalizations, adverse process-of-care
outcomes, and aggressive care of minimal benefit at end-of-life. Additionally, the Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic added an unprecedented challenge to providing long-term care. One of the most
significant initiatives designed to improve nursing home long-term care quality has been the institutional special
needs plan (I-SNP), a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for long-term care residents authorized under the
2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Not only does capitated payment to I-SNPs reduce incentives to hospitalize
residents, but the plans are adopt care models designed to increase coordination between the plan and the
nursing home to improve primary care. We estimate that both the number of I-SNP plans and enrollees have
more than doubled since 2012, and that 7% of all long-term nursing home residents with ADRD were enrolled
in an I-SNP as of 2018. The overall objectives of this study are to assess the impact of I-SNP enrollment on
long-term care quality for nursing home residents with ADRD both during the pre- and post-pandemic periods,
understand factors contributing to I-SNP enrollment and growth, and characterize how I-SNP care practices
influence resident outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that I-SNP enrollees with ADRD experience fewer
hospitalizations and better care quality than enrollees in traditional fee-for-service Medicare or other MA plans
due to comprehensive care management. To test these hypotheses and accomplish our objectives, we
propose a mixed-methods study. The quantitative component involves quasi-experimental econometric
analyses on a retrospective cohort of long-stay nursing home residents with ADRD using Medicare claims,
electronic health record, and other administrative data. The qualitative analysis will obtain key insights from
nursing home leaders on I-SNP performance, facilitators, and barriers. This project will produce a
comprehensive, nationally representative portrait of I-SNP effectiveness in serving persons with ADRD residing
in U.S. nursing homes. Findings will allow residents, families, nursing homes and other providers to make
informed decisions about I-SNP enrollment and participation."

Significance: Human milk (HM) has evolved over millions of years to nourish and protect human infants - yet
we know surprisingly little about its composition, variation, and function. Traditionally, HM research has focused
on individual HM components, yet HM is a complex biological system comprising thousands of components
that interact and function in combination. Moreover, while HM composition is known to be affected by maternal,
infant, and environmental factors, these are poorly understood and rarely examined simultaneously. To address
these gaps, our team is championing a multi-omics systems biology approach to study HM as a “system within
a system”, reflecting that milk itself is a system embedded within the “mother-milk-infant” triad.
Approach: This grant will leverage and unite two established HM research platforms to investigate HM and its
determinants and health impacts among 1600 mother-infant dyads using a novel multi-omic approach. The
International Milk Composition (IMiC) Consortium is a network of HM researchers and data scientists with an
established infrastructure for multi-omic HM research. CHILD is an ongoing national pregnancy cohort of 3600
children born in 2009-12. Our team has already analyzed 1600 CHILD HM samples for 19 oligosaccharides, 28
fatty acids, and hundreds of bacteria. We will now enhance the rich CHILD dataset with new multi-omic HM
analyses (20 nutrients, 15 non-nutritive bioactive proteins and thousands of metabolites) and apply
unsupervised machine learning methods to identify discrete ‘lactotypes’ (Aim 1). Next, we will leverage the rich
CHILD data to identify maternal, infant and environmental factors associated with lactotype membership and/or
individual HM components (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning methods to understand how HM
composition influences microbiome development, growth, wheezing and allergies during infancy and childhood
(Aim 3).
Innovation: Integrating the CHILD and IMiC platforms will facilitate unprecedented research on HM as a
system-within-a-system and generate the world’s largest and most deeply-phenotyped mother-milk-infant
dataset (n=1600 triads with multi-omic milk profiles and rich longitudinal maternal and infant metadata). This
project will unite expert HM scientists, renowned pediatric researchers and data scientists at the forefront of
multi-omic methods development, placing the interdisciplinary MuMi team in an unrivaled position to make
novel discoveries in this space and revolutionize the way HM is studied and understood."

during and beyond the 10-week on-site program; 2) enhance students’ knowledge, career intentions and
persistence in TERM in KUD research, specifically, and careers in biomedical research broadly; 3) develop and
implement a specialized career intentions and perceptions evaluation approach; 4) make a bigger impact on the
community; and 5) increase matriculation into graduate, PhD, and MD/PhD programs and careers with focus in
TERM and KUD research. These goals will be accomplished via a highly coordinated, mentored interdisciplinary
summer research institute with a combination of hands-on and “virtual” research activities, instrumentation
training, didactic components, specialized workshops, seminars and mini courses available across participating
departments and centers and other funded NIDDK R25 programs, spanning bioethics, responsible conduct of
research, health disparities, oral and written communications, and program-tailored education and career
development perceptions and intentions evaluation. All students provide an oral overview of their research,
present scientific posters at the NIDDK Summer Research Symposium and will be provided institutional support
for submitting abstracts for presentation at regional and national conferences. The program incorporates WFIRM
faculty, near-peer graduate students and leverages partnerships with the WFSM Department of Urology, the VT-
WF School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences and the WFIRM Bladder Research Center. Achieving our
goals will be facilitated by multiple extant regional and national partnerships with scientific, educational and
minority serving institutions to enhance recruitment, professional development and, notably, retain focus on KUD
research priorities. Overall, we expect these activities and approaches will reinforce positive alignment between
self-perceptions, perceptions of scientists, and career intentions and success in TERM and KUD research fields
across academic, government, and industry sectors."

The overall goal of this five-year proposal for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award
is for me to develop into a productive, independent academic investigator in the field of reproductive immunology.
I completed an MD and a PhD in the field of basic cellular immunology, and I now seek to apply my interest in
dysregulated immunity to the public health threat of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes of pregnancy. I
graduated from the American Board of Pediatrics Accelerated Research Pathway for Residency in General, and
I completed my Fellowship in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and
the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). I joined the faculty of CHOP and Penn as an Attending Physician and
Instructor in the Division of Neonatology. My mentor for this award, Dr. Edward M. Behrens, is a physician-
scientist with a longstanding track record of scientific innovation and providing exceptional training to mentees
at all levels. As an internationally-recognized expert in innate immunity and inflammatory disorders, Dr.
Behrens’s work complements my own, and we are thus poised for productivity. My scientific advisory committee
includes scientists and physician-scientists with collective expertise in all aspects of the proposed work, from
placental biology to next-generation sequencing. I am also extremely fortunate to have the unreserved support
of CHOP and Penn, whose combined resources are unmatched.
Scientifically, this proposal focuses on roles for novel macrophages that I discovered under the guidance of Dr.
Behrens, called CD122+Macs, in normal and threatened pregnancy. Enriched in the uterus in mice and humans,
CD122+Macs express high levels of CD122, the hallmark of responsiveness to interleukin-15 (IL-15). These
novel Macs signal and function when exposed to IL-15, surprising because killer lymphocytes like natural killer
(NK) cells, not Macs, are the classical targets of IL-15. Disrupted homeostasis of IL-15 is associated with
numerous adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including preeclampsia and abnormal feto-placental growth but
through unknown mechanisms. Based on prior literature and my preliminary data, my central hypothesis is: IL-
15 exerts its influence over outcomes of pregnancy not only by maintaining NK cells but also by modulating the
inflammatory properties of novel CD122+Macs. The aims of this proposal will establish: 1) Mechanisms by which
CD122+Macs respond biochemically and transcriptionally to IL-15 and 2) IL-15-dependent requirements for
CD122+Macs in pregnancy in vivo. This proposal will close major gaps in knowledge regarding the mechanism
by which IL-15 acts on a novel cellular target to ensure maternal and fetal health during pregnancy. In
accordance with my career development objective to become a field leader in reproductive immunology, my
scientific proposal complements my current proficiency in cellular immunologic methods with training in
advanced reproductive biology and bioinformatic methods."
10804720,"CDC-RFA-DP-21-001 Louisiana PRAMS Application
Project Introduction:
 The Louisiana Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) performs a key
role in evaluating and guiding the Louisiana Bureau of Family Health’s (BFH) efforts through
data analysis and translation in order to reduce infant morbidity and mortality by impacting
maternal behaviors before and during pregnancy and in early infancy. The Louisiana Department
of Health (LDH), Office of Public Health (OPH), Bureau of Family Health (BFH) has
successfully collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on
PRAMS as a grantee since 2001. Since then, Louisiana PRAMS data have been used by program
planners, healthcare providers, policy makers, and public health leaders to design, implement and
evaluate programs and services relevant to women and infants in Louisiana. This funding
opportunity will allow Louisiana to continue to provide valuable and unique data to stakeholders.
Prevalence of behaviors and risk factors during the perinatal period can illuminate strategies for
action, and ultimately improve health across the life course for women and infants. This aim is
accomplished through monitoring health status and progress in addressing Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA) Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant 5-Year
Priority Needs and through the following objectives:
  To implement population-based surveillance within a defined vital records jurisdiction on
 selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during, and shortly after
 pregnancy among women with a recent live birth, including emerging issues, i.e. opioid
 use and post-disaster surveillance needs, as they arise.
  To ensure data are of high scientific quality and comparable to other jurisdictions by
 following the methodology documented in the CDC PRAMS protocol.
  To conduct comprehensive analyses of PRAMS data based on a written jurisdiction-
 specific analysis plan designed to inform programmatic activities, research, and public
 health practice.
  To translate and disseminate analytic results into useable information for public health
 action that can guide program development and evaluation in collaboration with a
 jurisdiction-level steering committee.
 Monitoring is performed through data collection and analysis of MCH indicators such as
prenatal care visit access and content, tobacco and alcohol use, breastfeeding practices, oral
health during pregnancy, partner violence, stressful life events, infant sleep position, maternal
depression, pre-pregnancy weight, insurance coverage, and birth outcomes. Louisiana PRAMS
findings and data, which are linked to Louisiana's birth data, are used both internally and
externally to impact public health practice, program implementation and evaluation, legislation
and policy.

10887397,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Eukaryotic pathogens cause significant disease globally, and more locally, threaten the health of citizens in South 
Carolina and the Southeastern United States. Clemson University’s strength in eukaryotic pathogens research 
led the Clemson University Board of Trustees to approve formation of the Eukaryotic Pathogens Innovation 
Center (EPIC) in January 2013. The overarching theme of EPIC is the study of globally important eukaryotic 
pathogens using state-of-the-art molecular, cellular, biochemical, genetic, chemical, biophysical, and genomic 
approaches. The Specific Aims of the Administrative Core proposal are: (1) to continue building Clemson EPIC 
into a nationally and internationally recognized research center, (2) to recruit high quality faculty with diverse 
research interests to build critical mass and expand the breadth of EPIC, and (3) to develop and administer a 
comprehensive mentoring program to enhance Target Investigator (TI) success in research and grantsmanship. 
Three key approaches to achieving these aims are: (i) expanding the breadth of expertise by hiring additional 
faculty and postdoctoral researchers in the area of eukaryotic pathogenesis and providing them with 
comprehensive and intensive mentoring in research and grantsmanship to provide them with the tools to 
successfully compete for NIH R01 or equivalent funding; (ii) continuing to host presentations by top researchers 
in the field at the Cellular Biology of Eukaryotic Pathogens meeting and at Center/Departmental/College 
seminars to raise EPIC’s profile; and (iii) enhancing research infrastructure within EPIC and the Clemson Light 
Imaging Facility and the Clemson University Genomics and Bioinformatics core facilities to aid in the research 
enterprise. The overall plan for the EPIC Administrative Core combined with the demonstrated commitment of 
the College of Science and the Clemson University Administration will position EPIC to truly achieve the status 
of a Center for Biomedical Research Excellence."

Training and Education have been central to the mission of the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) since its inception.
Aligned with the SCI Strategic Plan, SCI Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination Core (CRTEC)
integrates and organizes resources to (1) coordinate and promote cancer training, education and career
development activities across the training continuum within the SCI and across Stanford University; (2) develop
and foster continuous quality improvement and evaluate the impact of CRTEC programs on training and
education; and (3) promote diversity and inclusion across all CRTEC activities. CRTEC provides SCI members
and their trainees with a central point of contact for cancer-related training and education across the Stanford
Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Humanities & Sciences. CRTEC oversees a large portfolio of training
grants that include 4 NCI-funded and 14 other cancer-relevant T32 training programs and a new American
Cancer Society Institutional Research Pilot Grant program. The SCI Fellowship Program, in existence since
2014, provides a critical source of funding that enables trainees to complete their cancer research training while
applying for extramural support and transitioning to faculty appointments. During the current funding period, the
SCI has provided a total of $1.5 million from institutional funds to support 24 SCI fellows, of those 8 SCI fellows
hold cancer-focused K08 awards, and 9 SCI fellows have transitioned to faculty positions over the current funding
period. Educational activities sponsored by the SCI include an annual multi-day research symposium for
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, currently in its twelfth year, a weekly seminar series in cancer
biology, and weekly oncology seminars focused on clinical and translational research. Programs are also in
place for high school students with an emphasis on underrepresented student groups and for Masters students,
including for those with existing MD degrees. Future plans include hosting an annual Junior Faculty Forum and
fostering interactions with SCI Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) to enhance community outreach."
10887400,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genomics and bioinformatics are the currency in today’s Life Science research. A major obstacle
for junior faculty from IDeA states is the lack of state-of-the-art facilities and training opportunities
commonly found in states with substantial NIH funding. This often hinders the generation of
preliminary data necessary to be competitive for NIH R01 funding. The implementation of
advanced tools to measure and interpret gene dynamics and genomic architecture is vital to the
study of eukaryotic pathogens for the development of therapeutic intervention. Genomic level
analyses and bioinformatics are a developing field, with rapidly emerging new standards and
technologies that provide insight into the fundamentals of eukaryotic biology. Most life science
researchers are not experienced in the use of bioinformatics and genomics. Therefore, we
propose the continuation of the bioinformatics specialists hired under COBRE Phase I, hire an
additional wet lab technician to handle our rapidly increasing load and then bolster the genomics,
computational and bioinformatic infrastructure and educational outreach via the Clemson
University Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility (CUGBF) throughout Phase II. The enhanced
CUGBF is structured into three complementary parts: 1) a molecular laboratory with genomics
and next-generation sequencing (NGS) resources, 2) a bioinformatics laboratory with high
performance computing resources, & 3) the personnel and equipment at the Clemson University
Center for Human Genetics- Genomics Sciences laboratory (CUCHG-GSL which is supported by
a COBRE in Human Genetics). Having all three allows the enhanced CUGBF to offer a
comprehensive service package from extraction and next-generation sequencing of nucleic acid
to the complex data analysis and interpretation. Through this model, CUGBF has designed,
executed, and educated EPIC TIs and CU faculty to enable the integration of genomics and
bioinformatics into their research programs. The Primary goal of this COBRE Phase II core
enhancement proposal is to continue to enhance the current physical and human capital for
genomics and computational infrastructure of the CUGBF and integrate genomic data and
computational resources into the TI’s and CU faculty research programs."
10887402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells (CB) Program is a basic and translational science program that aims
to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying cancer development. From these insights, we aspire to
improve cancer diagnosis and treatment through the following specific aims: (1) understand the regulation and
function of normal and cancer stem cells, (2) understand the mechanisms of initiation and progression of
epithelial cancers, and (3) identify potential new therapeutic targets.
The program is co-led by Laura Attardi, PhD, and Roeland Nusse, PhD. In 2019, the former Cancer Biology
Program and Cancer Stem Cells Program merged with the approval of the EAB to become the current Cancer
Biology and Cancer Stem Cells Program. In the current funding period, program members have made substantial
progress in understanding the self-renewal pathways of cancer stem cells and in elucidating signaling pathways
of high cancer relevance, including most prominently the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. They have also
pioneered a new technology, ATAC-seq, that enables a more fundamental understanding of the role of chromatin
in gene expression and used organoid and mouse model systems to discover the mechanisms of tumor
suppressors and progression and to uncover new therapeutic targets. The 53 members of the current program
represent 16 departments within the Schools of Medicine (SOM), Humanities and Sciences, and Engineering.
Members are supported by peer-reviewed research totaling $25.6M, including 34 R01s, 12 R35s, 6 U01s, and
3 T32s. Peer-reviewed cancer-focused research funding consists of $7M from the NCI, $12M from other NIH
sources, and $6.6M from other peer-reviewed sources. The members of this program are highly motivated and
interactive in their goal to use basic science approaches to understand cancer initiation and progression, with
the ultimate aim of improving cancer diagnosis and treatment. Since 2015, members of the CB Program have
published 668 manuscripts. Of these, 16% represent intra-programmatic, 31% represent inter-programmatic,
and 95% multi-institutional collaborations, 43% and 33% are in journals with IF>10 and IF>20, respectively. The
Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) enhances the program’s goals by providing state-of-the-art shared resources,
seed grant support for new projects, programmatic funds, retreats, special seminars, support for new faculty
recruitments, and clinical trial infrastructure for translation of research findings. The support from the SCI has
also been instrumental in promoting both intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations through organizing
programmatic and working group meetings and providing the means to interface with the more clinically oriented
programs to enhance our translational impact. Future plans incluce to further enhance intra- and inter-
progammtic collaborations by enhance cancer focused working groups."

10887405,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The central focus of the Radiation Biology (RB) Program is to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy (RT) to
enhance both tumor control and survival of cancer patients. Program members investigate new agents that can
be combined with RT to improve tumor control while minimizing collateral toxicity to normal tissues, develop
novel technologies for radiation treatment planning and delivery, and apply new markers to assess treatment
response, prognosis, and toxicity. To achieve these goals, basic discoveries, preclinical models, genomics,
radiomics, engineering, and deep learning are used to obtain critical supporting data to take these approaches
to clinical trials. Thus, the program includes both basic and translational science.
The program was co-led by Quynh Le, MD, and Amato Giaccia, PhD, between 2015 and 2019. With Giaccia’s
partial retirement in 2019, the program is now led by Quynh-Thu Le, MD, and Maximilian Diehn, MD, PhD. Le
provides expertise in hypoxia, the interaction of the immune system with RT, and stem cell-targeted therapies
for mitigating RT toxicity, whereas Diehn adds expertise in cancer genomics, liquid biopsies, biomarker
technology development, and genetic causes of radiation resistance. The 31 full members of this program
represent the School of Medicine, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory. They are supported by peer-reviewed research totaling $6.2M in direct funding, including 15 R01s,
which is higher than the previous cycle of this grant. Peer-reviewed funding consists of $3.9M from the NCI,
$1.4M from other NIH Institutes, and $0.8M from other sources. The RB program members are motivated,
innovative and collaborative, both within the program and with other research programs across the Stanford
Cancer Institute (SCI), in their goal to translate fundamental discoveries made in the laboratory to enhance the
safety and efficacy of RT for cancer patients. Since 2015, members of the RB Program have published 561
manuscripts. Of these, 35% represent intra-programmatic collaborations and 37% represent inter-programmatic
collaborations. The Stanford Cancer Institute enhances the program’s goals by providing state-of-the-art shared
resources, seed grant support for new projects, programmatic funds, retreats, special seminars, support for new
recruitments, and facilitates collaboration with other programs through seed funding and retreats. The support
from the SCI has been instrumental in promoting both intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations that were
essential for the submission of a new P01 application."

The Cancer Imaging and Early Detection (CID) Program advances cancer detection and management by
carrying out novel research using innovative imaging technologies. The major goals of the program are threefold:
(1) Advance screening and early cancer detection through the integration of in vitro and in vivo diagnostics; (2)
Improve cancer therapy monitoring and image-guided therapy through the development and testing of novel
diagnostic and theranostic probes; and (3) Improve the speed, safety, and accuracy of medical imaging
procedures through the development of advanced image data processing algorithms. These goals will be
accomplished through three specific aims: (1) The development and clinical translation of novel instrumentation
for in vitro and in vivo cancer diagnosis; (2) The design, preclinical development, and clinical translation of
molecular imaging agents and assays for cancer diagnosis and management; and (3) The development of
advanced image data processing algorithms, including artificial intelligence.
Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, MD, PhD, co-led the CID Program from 2015 to 2017 with Chris Contag, PhD, and from
2017 to 2020 with Heike Daldrup-Link, MD. Contag transitioned to a leadership position at Michigan State
University in 2017. Before his untimely passing in 2020, Gambhir ensured a seamless transition, carefully
selecting and training his successors. Since July 2020, the CID Program is co-led by Daldrup-Link and Daniel
Rubin, MD, MS. Daldrup-Link provides specific expertise in preclinical and clinical MR imaging as well as
nanoparticle development for MRI and theranostics. Rubin brings his computational and artificial intelligence
background to the cancer imaging field to enable biomedical discovery and to advance clinical efforts toward
personalized care. Both program co-leaders have more than 20 years of experience in imaging research, which
spans the entire breadth of medical imaging techniques. The 35 members of the CID Program represent the
Stanford Schools of Medicine (SOM), Engineering, and Humanities & Sciences and are supported by peer-
reviewed research funding totaling $8.2M, including 28 R01s, 3 R21s, and 5 U01s. The program also has a
major focus on training the next generation of imaging researchers and physician-scientists with 3 T32 grants
and 2 R25 programs. Peer-reviewed funding consists of $6.6M from the NCI, $1.5M from other NIH, and $0.1M
other peer-reviewed support. Since 2015, members of the CID Program have published 619 manuscripts, of
which 22% represent intra-programmatic, 27% inter-programmatic, and 93% multi-institutional collaborations.
The Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) enhanced the goals of the CID Program by providing salary support for
personnel to manage the Cancer Imaging Shared Resource, grant support for new research projects, financial
support for research program retreats and seminars, and financial support for new recruitments. The support
from the SCI has been instrumental in promoting both intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations that were
essential for the CID Program."

The overarching goals of the Cancer Immunotherapy Program (CIM) are to enhance understanding of the
interaction between the immune system and cancer and to develop novel, effective cancer immunotherapies.
These goals will be achieved by (i) fostering collaborative research, (ii) developing and applying technologies to
probe the immune system with high dimensionality, and (iii) enabling and supporting bench-to-bedside-to-bench
translation to simultaneously deliver novel immunotherapies and discover biomarkers and mechanisms of
resistance to immunotherapies. Fundamental research led by program members during the current funding
period has enhanced understanding of T cell receptor (TCR):peptide interactions and identified unexpected
systemic contributions to local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Program members
have (i) generated new technologies that greatly enhance the information gleaned from next-generation TCR
sequencing; (ii) created the first platform capable of identifying targets of orphan TCRs; and (iii) developed
multiplex ion beam imaging (MIBI), which enables unparalleled dimensionality of protein analysis in FFPE tissue.
Translational research by CIM members (i) created “immune stimulating antibody conjugates” (ISACs) to induce
antitumor immunity; (ii) defined fundamental properties of T cell exhaustion and created exhaustion-resistance
and exhaustion-reversal platforms for adoptive cell therapy; (iii) discovered antigen density thresholds as a major
regulator of CAR functionality and created approaches to tune such thresholds; (iv) translated rationally designed
CAR-T cell therapies into clinical trials, which have provided benefit for patients with refractory cancers; and (v)
created a robust reverse translation program that is identifying novel biomarkers of response and pathways of
resistance to CAR therapeutics. Co-led by Crystal Mackall, MD, and Edgar Engleman, MD, the 27 members
of the program represent 11 departments in the School of Medicine (SOM). Program members are major
participants in a number of NCI R01s and P01s, two U54s, an R21, an R35, and one NIH T32 grant. Peer-
reviewed funding consists of $4.3M from the NCI, $3.1M from other NIH, and $3.6M from other peer-reviewed
sources, totaling $11.0M. Since 2015, 442 papers have been published, with 11% intra-programmatic, 42% inter-
programmatic, and 94% multi-institutional collaborations. Major future efforts will seek to (i) define mechanisms
of systemic immune tolerance that enable cancer metastasis; (ii) leverage advanced algorithms to interrogate
large datasets of TCR sequences; (iii) expand the use of single-cell technologies to improve understanding of
the immunobiology of cancer and predict/prevent toxicity of immunotherapies; (iv) develop next-generation cell
therapy platforms and conduct clinical trials aimed at improving the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies; and (v)
expand an already robust reverse translational program to define biomarkers of response and pathways of
resistance to CAR-T cell therapies."
10887417,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where 
millions are at risk for infection. The disease, which is caused by the eukaryotic pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, is 
typically fatal if untreated. Several therapeutic strategies are available, but outside of fexinidazole, these drugs are 
marred by relatively high toxicity, serious side-effects, and emerging resistance. Thus, there is a need for novel 
therapeutic strategies to treat this disease, and those caused by related organisms such as T. cruzi (American 
trypanosomiasis) and Leishmania spp. (leishmaniasis). Another protozoan target of our efforts, Trichomonas 
vaginalis, causes the most prevalent non-viral sexually-transmitted infection in the United States (ca. 3 million 
cases) with in excess of 120 million cases worldwide. Recently, we discovered a straightforward (one-step) route to 
synthesize a novel class of compounds, the diazacyclobutenes (DCBs), and we determined that some of them 
have potent anti-trypanosomal activity. The central goals of this proposal are to further explore the structure- 
activity relationship of these compounds as anti-trypanosomal agents, to uncover their mode of action in 
trypanosomes, and to explore their utility against another common parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis. The efforts of 
this proposal are subdivided into three Aims. Specific Aim 1: To rapidly expand the library of diazacyclobutenes 
and explore the structure-activity relationships that govern their anti-trypanosomal activity. Specific Aim 2: To 
uncover the mechanism of action responsible for the observed anti-trypanosomal activity of the diazacyclobutenes. 
Specific Aim 3: To explore the utility of diazacyclobutenes against the Parabasalid protozoan, Trichomonas 
vaginalis. Overall, this study will represent the first characterization of diazacyclobutenes as anti-parasitic drugs, 
while developing the synthetic routes necessary for expansion of this interesting class of compounds. Successful 
completion of these studies will provide the framework for a future R01 submission that will focus on the 
development of much needed drugs for parasite infections."

The Cancer Therapeutics (CT) Program has been reconfigured from the previous Molecular Oncology Program
to unite an exciting new opportunity in drug development with ongoing research in the areas of biomarker design
and new diagnostic approaches to cancer, the ultimate objective being the development of clinical trials with high
impact for cancer patients with solid tumors. In conjunction with a University-wide initiative to enable drug
discovery to improve human health, the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) Strategic Plan has made the discovery
of new approaches to cancer treatment one of its major pillars. This new emphasis on drug development has
been enabled by the recruitment of Nathanael Gray, PhD, co-leader of the program and a pre-eminent
researcher in the development of novel therapeutic agents for cancer. Program co-leader, George W. Sledge,
MD, has more than three decades of experience as a clinical trialist involved in Phase I, II, and III trials, including
trials that have led to the FDA approval of new agents in breast cancer, as well as significant experience in the
development of biomarkers for breast cancer. This complementary leadership team, in conjunction with a diverse
and talented program membership, integrates highly relevant basic science research with the development and
implementation of impactful clinical trials across the spectrum of solid tumors. With the addition of 24 new
members since the last review, the 67 program members represent 3 schools and 18 departments across the
University and are supported by peer-reviewed research totaling $10M, including 20 R01s. Peer-reviewed
funding consists of $4.8M from the NCI, other NIH support amounts to $3.3M, and other peer-reviewed support
to $1.8M. CT program members are highly motivated and interactive in their goal of bringing forward novel
therapeutic options for cancer patients. Since 2015, members of the CT Program have published 814
manuscripts. Of these, 21% represent intra-programmatic, 42% represent inter-programmatic, and 95%
represent multi-institutional collaborations. The SCI has fostered the CT Program by greatly expanding its
potential through new recruitments, providing innovation fund support for new projects, as well as funds for
retreats and seminars. SCI’s support has been instrumental in promoting intra- and inter-programmatic
collaborations and in the planning and submission of two SPORE applications. The CT Program plans to
accelerate investment in the discovery of new small molecule therapeutics, expand our clinical Early Drug
Development Program, and pioneer high-impact clinical trials."

The goal of the Hematologic Malignancies (HM) Program is to gain a better understanding of the biology
underlying hematologic neoplasms and to apply this knowledge to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these
disorders. In working toward this goal, we have a broad research program with major themes of mechanisms of
disease pathogenesis, biomarker monitoring, and the development of new therapies. The 41 members within
our program represent 7 departments within the School of Medicine and the Department of Chemistry in the
School of Humanities and Sciences. They are supported by peer-reviewed research totaling $8.6M, including
9 R01s. Peer-reviewed funding consists of $4.3M from the NCI, $2.7M from other NIH institutes, and $1.6M from
other sources. Our program has emphasized translational research to the clinic in diagnostics and novel
therapeutics and from the clinic to the laboratory in studies of patient-derived tissues. During this CCSG cycle,
670 publications have been published in peer-reviewed journals, of which 23% were intra-programmatic, 36%
were inter-programmatic, 94% were multi-institutional, and 32% were in high-impact journals (32% IF >10; 17%
IF >20). During the last funding period, our members served as lead investigators for clinical trials leading to
several FDA approvals, including ibrutinib for chronic graft vs. host disease and mogamulizumab and
brentuximab for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Our program members have been major contributors to the
development of the anti-CD47 antibody magrolimab for hematologic malignancies and are now active
participants in clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Cooperative group
clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including combination ibrutinib and venetoclax, have been led by
program members. Hematologic Malignancies program members have pioneered the measurement of liquid
biopsies for prognosis and tracking of diffuse large B cell lymphoma with potentially practice-changing results.
Our pre-clinical and laboratory studies have advanced novel immunotherapy methods, including in situ
vaccination and in vivo delivery of mRNA therapeutics that have entered early-phase clinical trials in some cases.
Ongoing basic science efforts are focused on the characterization of leukemia stem cells, application of single-
cell technologies to the study of disease and cellular heterogeneity, investigations into lymphomagenesis with
attention to the Myc oncogene, epigenetic contributions to hematologic malignancies, and the role of the immune
system in combatting these cancers. In the future, we aim to continue our efforts to develop approaches to
replace current cytotoxic regimens with safer, more effective therapies for hematologic neoplasms."

The goal of the Population Sciences Program (PS) of the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) is to conduct high-
impact transdisciplinary and translational research across the cancer continuum aimed at improving detection
through screening, reducing cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality, and improving cancer outcomes. The PS
achieves this goal by promoting and facilitating innovative multidisciplinary observational and interventional
research on cancer that will impact public health and guide clinical practice and health policy. PS members are
nationally and internationally recognized clinical and population scientists with a broad range of unique strengths
in epidemiology, genetics, quantitative modeling, bioinformatics, use of novel technologies, behavioral science,
lifestyle (physical activity, diet, tobacco control, sleep), and clinical and palliative care interventional trials, and
community health and prevention research. The program’s overarching research priorities include reducing the
cancer burden and disparities (by age, sex and gender, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geography,
and other social determinants of health) in the highly diverse population of SCI’s catchment area.
PS members’ research addresses the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Conduct research on cancer etiology, risk
prediction, screening, and genetic testing; Aim 2: Investigate the impact of cancer treatment and prognostic
factors on outcomes; and Aim 3: Conduct intervention research to reduce cancer risks and improve outcomes.
The PS has 39 members, of whom 31 are supported by peer-reviewed funding totaling $14.0M, including $7.4M
from the NCI, $5.0M other cancer-relevant NIH support, and $1.6M from other peer-reviewed support. During
the current funding period, PS members published 1,130 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Of these, 22% are intra-
programmatic, 23% are inter-programmatic, 96% are multi-institutional, and 18% are in journals with an impact
factor of 10 or higher. Support from the SCI has been instrumental in promoting both intra- and inter-
programmatic collaborations of PS members, recruiting new faculty members, and enabling preliminary research
through innovation grants that lead to externally funded projects. PS members also strive to train the next
generation of cancer prevention researchers. In the future, the PS will further expand and focus on research in
genetic risk profiling and assessment, outcomes and survivorship research across the life course, cancer in
sexual and gender minorities, and health services and implementation science, and will develop and submit a
T32 training grant in genetic epidemiology and population sciences."

The long term objective of the proposed research is to use cellular therapy to advance regenerative medicine.
In particular, we wish to help amputees who have lost a limb. While major improvements have been made to
prosthetics, the skin side of the interface at the stump site was not evolved to bear weight. The stump does not
normally have the pressure adaptive abilities of the soles of the foot for example. The present grant proposes
to biopsy, purify and expand fibroblasts from an existing palm or sole and inject them into the stump site of an
amputee to improve their use of prosthetics. We also propose to study the basic biology behind cell therapy to
understand how the injected cells change the native cells, and in turn how those native cells affect the injected
cells. The results of this grant will hopefully lead to a new therapy to help not only amputees, but potentially
prevent pressure ulcers and provide a platform for future cell therapies."

The proposed Biotechnology Research Incubator for Teachers (BRITE) program aims to address the scarcity
of summer Research Experiences for Teachers (RETs) opportunities specifically for middle school teachers in
the Houston area and the challenges they face in translating their experiences into the classroom. The BRITE
aims to bridge the gap between authentic science research and technology and standards-based science
instruction using Adapted Primary Literature. Recognizing the influence of teachers on student’s success
in science, technology, engineering, math, and biomedicine (STEMM) education, the BRITE seeks to equip
middle school teachers with the necessary knowledge and skills to educate the next generation of thinkers and
problem solvers effectively. The BRITE highlights the need for teachers to have a solid understanding of
current bioscience research and biotechnology practices, and career paths in STEMM fields. Many U.S.
science teachers need to gain this up-to-date knowledge, emphasizing the importance of providing
opportunities for advanced scientific training, hands-on research experiences, and support for integrating
these experiences into the classroom. With its expertise in biomedical research and strong affiliations with
clinical locations, Baylor College of Medicine is well-positioned to offer teachers an immersive
biotechnology research experience. The BRITE program comprises a three-week intensive summer
component and year-round activities. To increase opportunities and reduce income inequality and promote
inclusion, the program aligns compensation with summer school rates and strategically schedule the
summer portion to allow teachers time to relax and recharge before the new academic year. The BRITE
program has three aims: recruit teachers to engage in research laboratories, provide professional
development to align research practices with standards and investigate the impact of authentic research
experiences on teacher and classroom outcomes. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided Adapted Primary
Literature and guidance from mentors, middle school teachers will learn to integrate real-world research and
literature into their instruction, exposing students to STEMM research careers and practices. We will
evaluate the effects of research experiences and primary literature adaptation on teaching and learning.
The BRITE Scholars will consist of a cohort of 12 teachers in the first year and 16 teachers in each of the
following grant years, a total of 76 teachers in four years. The BRITE program is estimated to impact ~7000
middle school students through instruction from the participating teachers, which will extend to more students
through trained teachers influencing their colleagues, and fellow teachers, amplifying the reach and
influence of the BRITE program."

 Scientists who are women, disabled or certain racial minorities remain under-represented among the tenure-
track faculty at US research universities. Broadening participation by researchers from these under-represented
groups (URGs) is a priority, because it will enhance science innovation and productivity, improve future trainees’
learning environments and enhance the international competitiveness of the US biomedical enterprise. Recent
studies have shown that the postdoc-to-faculty transition is a major attrition point for scientists from URGs on
the path to tenure. Therefore, new interventions are needed to support researchers from URGs as they seek
and commence tenure-track positions at research-intensive universities.
 The American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) is well-positioned to address this need. ASCB has a
successful, decades-long history of promoting the research and professional development of scientists from
URGs at all career stages. Building on this deep experience and the rich resources of ASCB membership, we
propose an ASCB MOSAIC Program (AMP) to enhance the success of scholars from URGs in tenure-track
faculty positions. AMP adopts the tripartite integration model of social influence, an established framework
postulating that trainees’ senses of science efficacy, science identity and alignment of values contribute to their
persistence in STEM fields. AMP will provide a combination of evidence-based, rigorously evaluated skills
development workshops, mentor training and institutional culture-change initiatives to augment AMP scholars’
science efficacy, identity and values alignment. We will accomplish this goal through three Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To provide skills development for AMP scholars. We will create a cohort-based
 professional skills development program that builds on the strengths of AMP scholars to enhance their
 preparation, hiring, retention and success in tenure-track, research-intensive faculty positions.
 Specific Aim 2: To train AMP program mentors. We will create a cohort-based training program for AMP
 scholars’ postdoctoral supervisors, plus additional, supplemental scientific and professional development
 mentors, with these relationships continuing across the postdoc-to-faculty transition.
 Specific Aim 3: To catalyze institutional interventions that broaden participation among research
 faculty. We will convene departmental and university leadership to exchange best practices for effecting
 institutional change, improving their cultures of inclusiveness and broadening participation, retention and
 success among faculty from URGs.
 We expect that AMP will significantly enhance our scholars’ success as tenure-track research faculty. Our
mentor training and institutional change initiatives will also benefit additional trainees and universities, beyond
our direct participants, extending AMP’s impact across the nation. We anticipate that the successful completion
of AMP will meaningfully advance inclusive excellence across the US academic biomedical workforce."
10890746,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overarching research goal of the PI’s research program aims to advance imaging science and technology
to transform biomedical research. To date, a complete understanding is still lacking to elucidate how biomole-
cules, organelles, and microenvironments are assembled within single cells, their variations over large popula-
tions, and their integrated roles in cell and tissue functions, developments, and disease initiation and therapeutics.
There have been major unmet imaging needs to probe the intracellular and multi-parametric complexities and
heterogeneity in cells and tissues with 3D nanoscale resolution, volumetric capability, high throughput and sen-
sitivity, and platform generalizability. To address the demands, the PI’s laboratory investigates the novel physical,
engineering, and instrumental principles and systems and deploys them to illuminate both fundamental and
medical discoveries. This renewal proposal aims to continue the efforts and establish and strengthen the pro-
gram’s leadership in systems biophotonics at the critical interface between imaging innovations and life sciences.
Specifically, the PI proposes the research program to proceed in three major directions to provide enabling
technologies that overcome imaging challenges in space, time, and accessibility for a deeper understanding of
biological complexities: (1) wave physics and super-resolution microscopy to probe intracellular complexities and
heterogeneity with 3D ultrahigh-resolution, volumetric capability, high throughput and sensitivity, and platform
generalizability; (2) light-field microscopy and computational microscopy to enable the interrogation and ultrafast,
in vivo imaging of multi-scale, volumetric biological dynamics and activities; (3) miniature microscopy and camera
physics to transform conventional imaging platforms and enhance imaging device accessibility to wide-ranging
imaging conditions, modalities, and biological systems. The successful accomplishment and dissemination of
the proposed research are anticipated to (i) promise and catalyze the discovery and translation of imaging sci-
ence and technology, (ii) provide methodological avenues and revolutionize biomedical investigations restrained
by conventional methods, and (iii) transform existing imaging infrastructure, laying a critical intellectual founda-
tion for broader science, engineering, and technology breakthroughs."

The number of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) in Uganda is over 170,000 and growing. Ugandan ALHIV
are a priority due to social and structural inequities that make them highly vulnerable to HIV infection and sub-
optimal access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Less than 50% of ALHIV in Uganda are ART-
adherent, leading to low rates of viral suppression and high attrition from HIV care. In response to calls for
expanding differentiated care approaches for ALHIV and new forms of combination HIV interventions, we seek
to intervene on social and structural inequities that exacerbate the risk for viral load non-suppression. Addressing
these hardships can improve ALHIV’s livelihoods and give them the knowledge and resources to sustainably
manage HIV. We have shown the effectiveness of Suubi (Hope) in four NIH-funded RCTs in Uganda. Suubi is
an evidence-based and theory-informed combination intervention with four components: 1) Financial Literacy
Training; 2) Incentivized Matched Youth Savings Accounts with income-generating activities; 3) a manualized
intervention for ART adherence and stigma reduction; and 4) Engagement with HIV treatment-experienced role
models who share lived experiences of HIV. Suubi has shown robust effects on viral suppression and ART
adherence, mental health and psychosocial outcomes, and family financial stability. Yet, it is unknown if each
component in Suubi had a positive effect, how the components interacted, or if fewer components could have
produced equivalent effects. Hence, we propose a factorial experiment to unpack and optimize Suubi to enhance
scale up in health systems using the multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST). We define our “optimization
objective” as the most cost-effective combination of intervention components considering three real-world
constraints: 1) efficiency, 2) affordability, and 3) scalability. We then evaluate the intervention component effect
sizes and balance these data against real-world information and costing data to empirically arrive at optimization.
The study aims are: Aim 1. Conduct a factorial experiment (optimization trial) to test the main effects of each of
the four Suubi intervention components and combinations of components (interactions) on viral suppression
(primary outcome); Aim 2. Test mediators and explore moderators that explain and modify the relationship
between each of the four Suubi intervention component and viral suppression; and Aim 3. Compare the cost and
cost-effectiveness of each of the four Suubi intervention components and every combination of components. We
will use a 24 factorial experiment with 16 conditions representing all combinations of the 4 components. Health
clinics (N=48) will be randomized to 16 conditions (12 ALHIV per clinic), yielding main effects and interaction
effects for the 4 components on sustained viral suppression (defined as an undetectable viral load at 12-, 24-
and 36-month follow-up assessments). An optimized intervention built within real-world constraints in SSA for a
high-priority group is an innovative and promising way to advance intervention science for HIV care globally."

Fall-related injuries affect the quality of life, healthcare costs, and longevity of millions of individuals with limb
loss, post-stroke hemiparesis, incomplete spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and aging-related sensorimotor
and physical decline. Current research indicates that there are multiple fall prevention interventions that can
reduce the incidence of falls among these populations. They include muscle strengthening, aerobic exercise,
virtual reality games, Tai Chi, yoga, and perturbation training among others. None of these interventions by
themselves are a single solution as the cause of poor balance and falls is a multifactorial problem. Recent
research indicates that intermittent visual occlusions (i.e. restricting vision for brief periods of time) can greatly
improve balance training efficacy. Inclusion of intermittent visual occlusions in a balance training task can
improve outcomes by four-fold and lead to longer lasting balance improvement. The goals of this project are to:
a) test if the effects of intermittent visual occlusions are similar for older and younger subjects, b) determine the
neural mechanisms responsible for enhanced balance training from intermittent visual occlusions using mobile
brain imaging with high-density EEG, and c) determine if the efficacy of balance training is dependent on timing
parameters of intermittent visual occlusions. We will study young and older healthy subjects performing a
dynamic balance training task (i.e. beam walking) to test whether intermittent visual occlusions result in
sensory reweighting of visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular feedback to the posterior parietal cortex. We will
also examine the efficacy of different visual perturbation parameters (timing of occlusion, timing of unrestricted
vision before occlusion, and using dimming of light instead of total occlusion). The results will provide
information on the neural mechanisms involved in enhanced balance training and point towards which patient
populations will most benefit from intermittent visual occlusions added to their balance training. Findings will
also determine the best way to deliver visual perturbations to maximize the success of a future multi-task
balance training clinical trial.

While immunotherapy has shown great promise for robust clinical responses in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), only
1 in 3 patients will see benefit. Current clinical biomarkers, such as mutation burden or PD-L1 expression, have
proven to have no predictive capacity in RCC; however, the applicant has recently identified a gene signature of
DNA replication stress response (RSR) defects that has predicted immunotherapy response in multiple
independent cohorts. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that RSR defects lead to activation of STING
signaling to promote sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade, and that pharmacological induction of RSR
defects can sensitize otherwise resistant tumors to immunotherapy. During the K99 mentored phase, the
applicant will use highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry to analyze differences in the immune
microenvironment between RSRD-low and RSRD-high patients (Aim 1.1). The applicant will then generated a
diverse array of genetically engineered RCC mouse transplant models to enable controlled in vivo studies, and
validate that RSR defects are causally linked to immunotherapy response (Aim 1.2). In Aim 2, the applicant will
seek to mechanistically understand how RSR defects contribute to immunotherapy response by CRISPR-
mediated deletion of STING from an RSRD-high model (Aim 2.1) and in vivo CRISPR screens targeting genes
contained within the RSRD signature to ascertain causality (Aim 2.2). The applicant will transition to the R00
independent phase as the CRISPR screen is completed. The CRISPR screen results can serve as a basis for a
first R01 submission. Aim 3 will seek to identify pharmacological compounds that will induce RSR defects to
sensitize otherwise resistant models to immunotherapy, and will serve as the basis for a second R01 application.
This proposal brings together an advisory committee of phenomenal researchers with expertise in DNA damage,
immuno-oncology, renal cell carcinoma medical oncology, genetically engineered mouse models, and high-
throughput screening to bolster the applicant's skillset in these areas. This will be supplemented by coursework
in immunology and responsible conduct of research, as well as additional training to prepare the applicant for
leading an independent lab. The environment at MD Anderson, including both the researchers and facilities,
makes this one of the few locations where this project could be accomplished. Taken together, this proposal will
equip the applicant with the tools to launch by career as a tenure-track faculty member while providing critical
insight into immunotherapy for treatment of RCC to advance MD Anderson's goal of Making Cancer History."

 Flaviviruses such as Powassan virus (POWV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
are transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes. The outcomes of flavivirus infection are heterogeneous, with only a
subset progressing to neuroinvasive disease (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis, or paralysis). We hypothesize that
host genetic variation, particularly in antiviral response genes, contributes to differential disease outcome
following flavivirus infection. The Collaborative Cross (CC) panel of recombinant inbred mice provides an ideal
system to discover novel mechanisms of immune-mediated control of flavivirus pathogenesis because these
mice exhibit an expanded range of immune phenotypes on reproducible genetic backgrounds. We infected 17
CC lines with POWV and identified multiple highly susceptible lines, including CC071 and CC015, and a single
resistant line, CC045. Most phenotypes were concordant among POWV, WNV, and JEV, but some lines
exhibited virus-specific resistance, implying that there are both virus-specific and pan-flavivirus mechanisms that
control resistance to neuroinvasive flaviviruses. We propose to use the CC to determine the viral and
immunologic features of POWV pathogenesis and to identify host genes that contribute to POWV resistance.
 Aim 1: Define viral and immunologic features of POWV pathogenesis in CC mice. We found that CC045
mice exhibited equivalent viremia but lower brain viral loads compared to CC071 mice, suggesting that POWV
resistance may result from reduced neuroinvasion. We will assess brain viral loads and infiltrating leukocytes in
susceptible and resistant CC lines following POWV infection. We will assess blood-brain barrier permeability at
baseline and in response to viral infection and inflammatory stimuli. We will generate primary cells from
susceptible and resistant CC lines and measure replication of POWV and other flaviviruses.
 Aim 2: Map quantitative trait loci and evaluate antiviral activity of host factors associated with POWV
resistance. To identify polymorphic host genes that determine the outcome of POWV infection, we generated
two F2 crosses of susceptible and resistant lines (CC071 x CC045 and CC015 x CC045) and evaluated lethality
in ~300 F2 mice per cross following POWV infection, as well as CNS viral loads in ~120 F2 mice. We will map
QTL associated with POWV resistance in both crosses and investigate candidate genes under significant QTL.
 Aim 3: Distinguish pan-flavivirus and virus-specific restriction factors in CC mice. We will infect
additional CC lines with JEV to identify lines that are differentially resistant to JEV compared to POWV or WNV.
We will evaluate brain viral loads and infiltrating leukocytes following JEV infection. We will generate F2 progeny
of susceptible and resistant lines and map QTL associated with JEV resistance.
 The proposed studies will provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of POWV and reveal polymorphic
host immune mechanisms that impact susceptibility to flavivirus neuroinvasive disease. This work will provide
the foundation for future investigations of novel immune factors that control flavivirus pathogenesis."
10893398,"Project Summary/Abstract. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) represent approximately 40% of the human
proteome and are implicated in a large number of human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer.
Therefore, the biological relevance of IDPs has garnered substantial interest over the last decade. IDPs often
interact with curved membranes to form structures that are essential to cellular physiology, such as synaptic and
endocytic vesicles. These interactions are facilitated by membrane curvature sensing. The PI recently discovered
that IDPs are potent sensors of membrane curvature. This discovery is a substantive departure from the
predominant structure-function paradigm, as IDPs lack fixed three-dimensional structure and are often incorrectly
assumed to also lack biophysical functionality. The curvature sensitivity of IDPs, as well as many other types of
proteins, is normally studied at thermodynamic equilibrium. However, membrane-interacting proteins exist in a
dynamic equilibrium between their membrane-bound and membrane-unbound states. It can take minutes to
achieve thermodynamic equilibrium between proteins and membranes, but cellular processes, such as cell
signaling, occur anywhere between milliseconds to seconds. It is clear from this mismatch in timescales that
when thermodynamic equilibrium alone is considered, dynamic information that is pertinent to the timescale of
cellular processes is omitted. Little to no literature exists that examines this phenomenon, likely owing to the
difficulty associated with achieving such experimental measurements. Thus, dynamic interactions between
proteins and curved membrane structures are poorly understood. Using their expertise in quantitative
fluorescence microscopy and protein engineering, the goal of the PI's laboratory is to develop and apply
techniques and strategies that will allow for direct visualization and characterization of dynamic interactions
between IDPs and curved membrane structures. The PI's future research program contains 3 overarching
research projects. Work in Project 1 will evaluate the extent to which protein structure influences adsorption and
desorption kinetics, testing the working hypothesis that curved membranes affect various protein structures
differently. Work in Project 2 will evaluate the impact of protein networks on the binding dynamics of IDPs,
answering questions about the influence of protein multivalency on dynamic behavior. Work in Project 3 will
develop experimental techniques and strategies that mimic the intracellular environment, answering questions
about dynamic interactions between IDPs and curved membrane substrates that occur in the presence of two-
dimensional, phase separated protein mixtures on the membrane surface or three-dimensional protein
aggregates in the bulk solution. As previously mentioned, our current understanding of the interactions between
proteins and curved membranes was derived from systems in which the partitioning of proteins was measured
after thermodynamic equilibrium was achieved. In contrast, the proposed work will fill a key gap in existing
knowledge by directly observing and quantifying dynamic interactions between proteins and curved membranes."

We propose a novel regulatory T (Treg) cell therapy to treat IPEX syndrome, a rare autoimmune monogenic
disease. IPEX is a life-threatening disease caused by loss-of-function FOXP3 mutations leading to dysfunctional
Treg cells. The only current curative treatment for IPEX is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(allo-HSCT), which is only available to a minority of patients. The proposed product, CD4LVFOXP3 consists of
autologous CD4+ T cells that have undergone lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated gene transfer of wild-type human
FOXP3 leading to persistent high FOXP3 expression and acquisition of Treg cell phenotype and function.
CD4LVFOXP3 were granted Orphan Drug designation in October, 2020. Based on the etiology of IPEX, our
hypothesis is that the administration of autologous CD4+ T cells converted into CD4LVFOXP3 Treg-like cells
by LV-mediated FOXP3 gene transfer, will reduce the immune dysregulation and the autoimmune
manifestations. CD4LVFOXP3 is functionally equivalent to Treg cells and therefore, offer a novel cell therapy
approach that circumvents the requirement for generalized immune suppression (IS) and could improve the
clinical status of participants. This First-Time-in-Human (FTiH) Phase 1 clinical trial will test the feasibility of the
manufacturing and the safety of the administration of CD4LVFOXP3 (Aim 1) in minimum of 20 up to 36 evaluable
human participants with IPEX, who meet eligibility criteria. The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of
the CD4LVFOXP3 infusion on clinical manifestations. The dosing rationale has been developed with a conservative
approach based on initial cell doses used in previous clinical trials with Treg cells of different origins. CD4LVFOXP3
also express membrane NGFR (CD271) encoded within the same LV construct that contains the FOXP3 gene.
allowing ex vivo purification and traceability enabling further studies of CD4LVFOXP3survival, phenotypic stability
and functional characteristics. Thus, during this clinical trial, we will perform exploratory studies to build
knowledge on the CD4LVFOXP3 pharmacokinetics (PK) (Aim2) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (Aim 3) by monitoring
the immune phenotype and function of patient immune cells. The possibility to provide functional autologous
Treg-like cells is expected to be of benefit to all eligible IPEX patients. CD4LVFOXP3 could: 1. improve control of
clinical manifestations resulting in the reduction of IS and related side effects, and 2. diminish the need for allo-
HSCT, or allow patients to be transplanted in a more stable clinical condition, resulting in improved allo-HSCT
outcomes. Successful completion of this clinical trial in patients with IPEX using CD4LVFOXP3 Treg-like cells as a
functional replacement for FOXP3 mutated Treg cells, addresses a significant unmet medical need while also
providing proof of safety and preliminary indications of benefit in controlling autoimmune disease manifestations.
As such, data from this trial could lead to expanded application of autologous CD4LVFOXP3 to other Tregopathies
and/or other more common autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes
(T1D), cytopenia and atopic dermatitis, all of which have overlapping disease manifestations in IPEX patients."

Major depression is a highly debilitating disorder affecting over 300 million people worldwide. Treatment
assignment can involve a lengthy trial-and-error process complicated by symptom heterogeneity. The
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix provides a framework for investigating psychiatric disorders that
integrates across multiple levels of analysis. Depressive symptoms are closely linked to the RDoC Positive
Valence Systems (PVS) domain, but it is unknown how PVS constructs relate to common depressive
symptoms including low mood, anhedonia, and apathy. Computational probes of behavioral and affective
dynamics show great promise as a means of ‘computationally phenotyping’ individuals and providing a way to
validate PVS constructs in relation to symptom heterogeneity. The ubiquity of smartphones makes them an
ideal platform for remote testing. We propose to collect longitudinal data using smartphones for three ‘gamified’
tasks that measure risky decision making, probabilistic reinforcement learning, and reward-effort trade-offs and
concurrent fluctuations in affective state. We will establish the reliability of remotely collected computational
assays of behavioral and affective dynamics for understanding heterogeneity in depressive symptoms. We will
first test a community sample (n=200) both in the lab and remotely by smartphone to verify that behavioral and
affective computational parameters have the same relationship to depressive symptoms (low mood,
anhedonia, and apathy) in both environments (Aim 1). We will then recruit a large sample of patients with
moderate depressive symptoms (n=400) and test them remotely using smartphones for up to 12 months (Aim
2). We will test whether behavioral and affective computational parameters are related to changes in
depressive symptoms over time. We will also use data-driven recurrent neural network approaches to identify
additional features of our data related to depressive symptoms. Finally, we will collect MRI scans and in-lab
data in a subsample of patients (n=200) from Aim 2 and ask whether reward sensitivity and reward prediction
error, features of all three tasks, map onto consistent neural circuitry and depressive symptoms (Aim 3). We
will test for a mapping between depression subtypes defined by brain network connectivity, behavioral and
affective computational parameters, and depressive symptoms. Using computational models, we can bridge
between levels of circuits, behavior, and self-report, and test for a mapping onto heterogeneity in symptoms,
enhancing our understanding of RDoC constructs and paving the way for more effective and timely
interventions to treat depression."

This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular
quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response
to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to
maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer.
Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle
machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle
during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple
stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics-
fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from
proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle
machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A
computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large
imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this
framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase
Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated
transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this
computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the
establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery.
The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to
complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be
mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine
learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment
of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW.
Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the
study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and
will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation."

Three-dimensional (3D) folding of the genome plays fundamental roles in the regulation of transcription,
replication, DNA repair and many other biological processes. Facilitated by Hi-C and related techniques, it is
becoming clear that the eukaryotic genome folds at multiple genomic scales to form different types of 3D
architecture, including topologically associated domains (TADs) and stripes. Different physical patterns of
change may happen to a type of 3D architecture, e.g., a TAD may show change of overall connectivity, or split
into smaller TADs. Whereas the existence and functional importance of the genome’s 3D architecture is
increasingly recognized, analyzing its dynamic changes is currently a major challenge to biologists. The
community urgently needs novel bioinformatics techniques to define potential physical patterns of change for
each type of 3D architecture, to systematically detect all changes in the genome, and to statistically determine
the significance of each change. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that two physical patterns of change to
the genome’s 3D architecture -- TAD splittings and stripe strengthenings -- regulate cell identity transitions.
Accordingly, we propose to develop TADsplit and StripeDiff, two bioinformatics toolkits to systematically define
these and additionally physical patterns of change to TADs and stripes between samples. As a proof of
principle, we will utilize the new techniques to investigate 3D genome alterations during endothelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cell identity transition that plays critical roles in both normal development
and many prevalent cardiovascular diseases. We will illustrate new mechanisms by which transcription factors
regulate genome’s 3D architectures to oppose EndMT. These investigations have the potential to better guide
the treatment of many diseases in which EndMT plays important roles. The novel bioinformatics techniques in
TADsplit and StripeDiff will enable researchers to investigate 3D genome changes in diverse biological models
of development and diseases."
10894197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lymphocyte development is precisely controlled to enable clonal expansion and expression of a diverse
immunoglobulin receptor repertoire, which proceeds through DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) generated by
the RAG endonuclease. These two dichotomous, but interdependent processes, are managed through the
cooperation of diverse cellular signals to prevent cells with DSBs from entering cell cycle where they could be
aberrantly repaired as translocations. During early B cell development, the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), through
activation of the SYK kinase, coordinates both the proliferative expansion of pre-B cells and the assembly of
immunoglobulin receptor genes. Negative regulation of the pre-BCR is required to ensure cell cycle arrest and
limit the number of DNA breaks generated during immunoglobulin receptor gene assembly. Indeed, unopposed
pre-BCR signaling, particularly increased SYK activity, drives proliferation and leukemic transformation.
However, the mechanisms that repress SYK and pre-BCR signaling are not known and remain a critical gap in
our understanding of B cell maturation. We have identified a novel cell-type specific program activated by signals
from RAG DSBs that suppresses SYK and inhibits pre-BCR signaling. Deficiencies in this DNA damage-
mediated feedback circuit result in initiation of pre-B cell leukemia. Surprisingly, this signaling network is not
triggered by all DNA injury but, rather, is specific to RAG DSBs generated during immunoglobulin receptor gene
assembly. Our goal is to determine how signals from RAG DSBs integrate with developmental programs
to coordinate B cell maturation and prevent leukemic transformation. We propose that RAG DSBs
suppress SYK to enforce cell cycle arrest and, thereby prevent B cells with DNA breaks from re-entering cell
cycle. This DNA damage-mediated checkpoint program would permit iterative attempts at generation of a mature
antigen receptor to promote B cell differentiation while preventing leukemic initiation. Further, we propose that
these DNA damage signals are activated through distinct domains of the RAG endonuclease that interact with
proteins at sites of DSBs to modulate signaling pathways. This RAG-specific mechanism in B cells discriminates
between normal and errant DSBs to activate appropriate cellular responses. Utilizing an innovative experimental
approach that allows interrogation of DSB signals within the context of B cell developmental programs, our
proposed studies will define how RAG DSB signals maintain pre-B cell checkpoint and will resolve the
mechanisms that distinguish RAG-mediated from non-RAG-mediated DNA damage. Completion of these studies
will delineate pathways critical for dampening proliferative signals in early B cells, establish signals that restrict
leukemogenesis, and define novel functions of the RAG endonuclease in regulating DNA damage responses."

Although there are numerous protocols to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and inducible
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ex vivo to a variety of cell types, they have encountered significant challenges in
translation to the clinic. However, it is now possible to regenerate the replica of organs/cells from one species of
animal within the body of a second species. This involves the knockout (KO) of specific developmental genes in
the blastocyst of species two; and the intra-blastocyst injection of pluripotent stem cells from species one to
generate offspring that carry organs/cell types derived from that donor. The translation of this approach requires
an efficient gene-editing technology. In fact, novel TALEN/CRISPR/Cas9 technologies provide such a rapid, and
cost-effective means to generate genetically modified animals. Accordingly, we propose to employ gene-editing
technology to knockout specific genes associated with liver development in the mouse embryo. We hypothesize
that rat liver can be generated in the mouse by the injection of rat ESCs or PSCs into CRISPR-genetically
engineered murine blastocysts and transplanted back into syngeneic rats. The studies represent a first step of
interspecies development of exogenic organs for transplantation without immunosuppression. We have
designed three Specific Aims to test our central hypothesis. Specifically, we will characterize (1) intra- and
interspecies exogenic liver and endothelium derived from HHEX KO embryos; (2) the immunology and function
of interspecies exogenic liver and endothelial development derived from HHEX KO embryos; and (3) several
approaches to enhance the generation of interspecies chimeras that include humanization of morphogen ligand-
receptor interactions. The resulting exogenic rat liver and endothelium will be transplanted back into syngeneic
rats to evaluate graft survival and functionality. The generation of whole livers that are comprised primarily of rat
hepatic and endothelial cells derived from implanted rat ESCs or PSCs would represent a paradigm shift and
provide the necessary preclinical evidence for ultimately creating human livers in animals. If successful, the
proposed research would be a game-changer that could conceivably pave the way for an alternate source of
human livers for organ and/or hepatocyte transplantation that is tailored to specific patients. In addition, this
novel, albeit somewhat high-risk approach circumvents many of the problems associated with research on
xenotransplantation. The potential impact on improved health care in the U.S. and worldwide for liver diseases
is great and represents a major step towards the goal of individualized medicine."

Precision medicine research (PMR) holds potential to transform health by unearthing genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms of disease and developing tailored prevention and treatment. Participation of adults with
intellectual disability in PMR offers new opportunities to address their substantial health disparities. Yet efforts
to identify their unique needs for inclusion and engagement in PMR have been lacking. Despite
evidence that most adults with intellectual disability demonstrate consent capacity, precision medicine (PM)
researchers may exclude them, fail to accommodate their unique needs in decision-making, or use proxy
consent with little meaningful assent. Consent of adults with intellectual disability to PMR further raises novel
concerns, including best models for consent and how to manage the return of genetic results while also
assuring genomic privacy and promoting inclusion and empowerment—believed to be critical for successful
PMR. Unfortunately, many PM researchers feel ill-equipped to respond; they express desire for
educational and practical resources that are not currently available. These gaps contribute to adults with
intellectual disability being understudied and create barriers to generating knowledge to address their health
needs. They also impede empowerment and are increasingly ethically questionable: adults with intellectual
disability want to be included in PMR. The proposed study employs an academic-community partnership to
close these gaps by: (1) conducting a national, disability-tailored survey with adults with intellectual disability to
identify preferences regarding decision-making role, communication of results, genomic privacy, and needs for
engagement in PMR; (2) Creating a PMR study-adaptable consent toolkit to support PM researchers in
including adults with intellectual disability in PMR and empirically test it via a text complexity study and
cognitive interviews with adults with intellectual disability to ensure understandability to this population; and (3)
Conducting a social validity study with PM researchers to assess the toolkit’s usability, relevance, acceptability,
and comprehensiveness. The web-based consent to PMR toolkit will be freely available. We will disseminate
our findings through workshops, webinars, peer-reviewed publications, and presentations at professional
meetings. PMR has stirred hopes for a new, scientifically-based, and empowering healthcare model that
reaches, and can benefit, those who are most vulnerable and experience substantial health disparities. This
project has the potential to transform PMR by helping PM researchers avoid the pitfalls of bias, uphold
principles of human agency valued by community members, deploy strategies to further grow and diversify
existing PMR datasets. This work will, over time, help foster practices in PMR that promote equitable
healthcare—NIH priorities. This research is the first-time multiple stakeholders including adults with intellectual
disability will collaborate to use empirical ethics inquiry to address consent and other challenges in PMR and
will yield critical theoretical and practical insights to PMR inclusive of adults with intellectual disability."

Significance: Racial/ethnic minority women with HIV living in the US face a multitude of mental health and social
challenges (stigma, poverty, mental health diagnoses, substance use, limited health / English literacy) that
impact their ability to adhere to HIV care (e.g., medications and medical appointments). This application
addresses disparities in minority HIV health outcomes in Miami, an epicenter of new US HIV infections [3].
Research Strategy: This is a Type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation pilot of mCARES, a multi-lingual
(English, Spanish, Haitian-Creole) mobile health (mHealth) adherence and engagement intervention for
racial/ethnic minority women living with HIV (MWLH), developed through the PI’s KL2. mCARES (mobile
Communications for Adherence Reminders Education and Support), uses evidenced-based approaches of
personalized text messaging and patient navigation, integrated with motivational interviewing, implemented in a
multi-lingual and multi-cultural Women’s HIV Clinic. The investigative team is nationally and internationally
recognized for designing and implementing HIV-behavioral and mHealth interventions, within the context of
mental health, trauma, substance use and racial/ethnic women. Because text messaging and patient navigation
are evidence-based approaches to behavior change, though not for the specific high-need multi-lingual
populations under study in the present project, there is a need for rapid scale up if successful, of this Type I pilot
hybrid trial focusing on both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. Intervention design is grounded in the
healthcare empowerment model (HCE), which considers the multifaceted influences that empower individuals
to engage in healthcare, and unifies other HIV behavioral intervention models, including CBT/LifeSteps to
improve adherence. Pilot-testing of implementation will follow the CFIR framework. Aim 1: Using ADAPT-ITT’s
iterative process of implementation, refinement (via exit interviews) and re-implementation, and the FRAME
approach for linguistic / cultural adaptation, conduct an open pilot trial (N=9; 3 MWLH per language). Aim 2:
Measure mCARES’ preliminary effectiveness on patient clinical outcomes; (Aim 2a) Assess feasibility,
acceptability and uptake of a 2-arm, pilot of mCARES (6 months). Participants will be randomized (N=78; 26 per
language; 3 languages; 1:1 allocation by language) to receive standard of care or mCARES. (Aim 2b) Assess
intent-to-treat effects on medication and appointment adherence, referral follow-through, and VL suppression;
and, (Aim 2c) test conceptual moderators (e.g., ethnicity, language, depression, drug use, resilience), mediators
(e.g. change in HIV stigma, depression, and individual determinants (e.g., health literacy) on intervention effects.
(Aim 2d) Taking a mixed-methods approach, pilot-test mCARES’ implementation determinants (e.g., patient-
level barriers to uptake, design quality). Successful completion of the aims will generate data for a full-scale
study. This application is in response to PA-21-205, to develop / test novel telehealth strategies for individuals
with HIV and substance use disorders, tailored to affected populations (e.g., multilingual approaches)."

Pulmonary thromboembolism remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. While
many of the initial symptoms in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) resolves with appropriate treatment, there is
increasing awareness of chronic impact of the disease ranging from development of chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to persisting dyspnea and exercise impairment. Many patients initially
diagnosed with PE may already have chronic disease and inappropriate treatment for acute disease in these
cases may be harmful and delay referral to specialized centers with experience in treating chronic disease. On
the other hand many patients with acute PE go on to develop chronic disease despite current treatment
options and follow-up to insure resolution remains a challenge particularly without the ability to predict who will
develop chronic disease. Furthermore, prognostication and selection of treatments can be difficult, particularly
in submassive acute PE and CTEPH, particularly with newly emerging treatment choices. Quantitative
methods are needed to help define disease trajectories early in presentation, help guide prognostication and
treatment and improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition.
Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is the cornerstone of evaluation of pulmonary thromboembolism. In
acute PE, it is the often the first imaging modality available for assessing treatment options. As the patient
recovers, it is used to detect chronic or reoccurring clot guide interventions in chronic disease. Advances in CT
imaging quality, image processing (including application of deep learning), coupled with increasing
computation power make possible the extraction of a large number of novel features from CT imaging. In this
proposal we seek to combine our team’s experience in CT image quantification with multi-center longitudinal
data to develop CT imaging features that can identify and predict disease chronicity, its impact on the
pulmonary circulation and its response to treatment. In Aim 1 we utilize longitudinal data from three academic
hospitals (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Northwestern University) to
assess CT features at presentation that predict the presence or development of chronic disease. In Aim 2, we
study both the presentation and follow-up image to build quantitative models of the impact of acute and chronic
disease on the pulmonary circulation in order to help with prognostication and improve non-invasive methods
of predicting the relevance of persistent disease to the clinical state of patients. In aim 3 we use a combination
of longitudinal imaging in CTEPH patients having undergone surgery and patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension to identify patients that would have the most optimal surgical outcomes. We believe that the
combination of the features and models developed in these complementary aims will advance our ability to use
clinically available CT imaging to improve phenotyping, prognostication and treatment decisions and improve
our understanding of the longitudinal progression of pulmonary thromboembolic disease."

Excessive alcohol use is a significant and serious public health problem, with 28.6 million US adults meeting
diagnostic criteria for current alcohol use disorder (AUD). The stress response is a promising target for
understanding vulnerability and possible intervention, as risky drinking patterns are deeply and bidirectionally
linked to stress responses. However, key characteristics of the stress response have not yet been leveraged: as
studies to date have focused on individual brain regions and static snapshots of brain responses, we cannot
capture the predictive potential of the multifaceted stress response, which involves widespread interactions
between brain regions and unfolds dynamically over time. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that dynamic whole-
brain responses can provide unique insight into stress-related conditions. The goal of this R01 is to leverage
advances in machine learning and computational modeling to develop and validate whole-brain biomarkers for
stress, and test whether dynamic engagement of these stress networks can predict individual differences in
drinking and alcohol-related cognition. Using a combination of secondary analysis (N = 390) and new collection
of functional MRI data (N = 100), we will identify and validate stress-predictive neuromarkers, capture dynamic
trajectories of stress neuromarkers, and test the consequences of these moment-to-moment dynamics for
cognitive mechanisms driving risky drinking. In Aim 1, we will build a connectome-based model that predicts
responses to multiple modalities of stress exposure in previously unseen individuals using rigorous cross-
validation techniques. We will identify functional connections that predict stress responses in clinically
heterogeneous samples as well as those specific to individuals with AUD. In Aim 2, we will create a novel
moment-to-moment framework to characterize stress response trajectories in the brain and their alterations in
AUD. This framework will enable us to test the hypothesis that, rather than simply having higher or lower
engagement of a stress-predictive network, individuals with AUD will show atypical stress network engagement
trajectories in response to a stressful event. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel neuroimaging paradigm to quantify
the temporal dynamics of brain stress network engagement on memory formation and subsequent drinking. With
this design, we will test the hypotheses that: 1) information that is temporally and conceptually congruent with
stress will be preferentially encoded; 2) dynamic stress networks will co-fluctuate with a validated neuromarker
of attention to facilitate learning; and 3) the timecourse and neural networks by which stress dynamically
modulates learning will differ in AUD and predict future drinking. Together, this work will provide new insight into
the brain’s stress response, including the ways in which its neural architecture (where), temporal dynamics
(when), and consequences for adaptive cognition (how), are predictive of chronic alcohol. The long-term goal of
this work is to develop clinically actionable neurocognitive markers of heavy drinking for early assessment,
intervention, and treatment. Future grants will apply this framework to predict treatment and relapse outcomes."

This proposal is to develop and implement methods for quantifying geographic disparities, within Sub-Saharan
African countries, in the opportunity for people living with HIV (PLHIV) to access antiretroviral therapy (ART);
and to identify optimal strategies for reducing such disparities. The methods that we will develop constitute a
novel analytic framework, which we will use to complete our three Specific Aims: (1) First, we will develop a
spatial interaction model which can be applied in any SSA country to estimate the geographic opportunity to
access ART and to identify disparities in this opportunity. We will apply the model to Malawi, which has one of
the most severe HIV epidemics in the world, and where our previous studies have shown that PLHIV face
substantial geographic disparities in accessing HIV care. To do so we will analyze a series of datasets, including
the nationwide Malawi Population-based HIV Impact Assessments [MPHIAs]; the MPHIAs were collected in
2015/16 and 2020/21, spanning a period when ART coverage increased substantially. (2) Second, we will
quantify the geographic relationship between the opportunity to access ART and its actual utilization, and
determine the degree to which this relationship changed between the two timepoints. (3) Third, we will use our
modeling framework in further analyses of the MPHIA 2020/21 dataset with the objective of identifying optimal
strategies to reduce geographic disparities in the opportunity to access ART; both through the location of new
healthcare facilities (HCFs) and through the allocation of additional supplies of ART. We will conduct these
studies through a U.S.-Malawi collaborative team."

Endothelial calcium signaling mechanisms regulate vascular function and blood pressure. In obesity, impaired
endothelial calcium signaling results in the loss of endothelium-mediated dilation and elevation of blood pressure.
The goal of this application is to identify targetable abnormalities in endothelial calcium signaling mechanisms in
obesity. Our recent studies show that TRPV4 channels, a crucial calcium entry pathway in endothelial cells,
lower blood pressure under normal conditions. Moreover, increased formation of peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen
species, reduces the activity of endothelial TRPV4 channels and elevates blood pressure in obesity. Tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), an inflammatory cytokine, is a well-known promoter of cellular peroxynitrite formation. Our
preliminary data show that TNF is selectively upregulated in the vascular smooth muscle cells in obesity.
Therefore, we will determine the role of smooth muscle cell TNF and endothelial cell TNF receptor I (TNFRI) in
increasing endothelial peroxynitrite levels and impairing endothelial calcium signaling in diet-induced obesity.
We will use newly developed cell-specific knockout mice for TNF and TNFRI in combination with peroxynitrite
and TRPV4 channel measurements in small arteries. Also, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation has been
linked with increased TNF levels and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we will delineate how vascular MR-
induced TNF production impairs endothelial calcium signaling and elevates blood pressure in obesity. We will
use smooth muscle cell-specific MR knockout mice to determine the role of smooth muscle MR in increasing
TNF production and impairing endothelial function in obesity. Finally, we will determine the contribution of smooth
muscle TRPV4 channels and related pathways in increasing TNF production in obesity. Studies in skeletal
muscle arteries of obese patients will establish the clinical relevance of our findings on vascular MR-TNF-TNFRI
signaling axis in obesity. Collectively, these fundamental and clinically relevant studies will fill major gaps in our
understanding of endothelial calcium signaling abnormalities in obesity and identify potential therapeutic targets
for rescuing endothelial function.

10892675,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The etiology of congenital brain growth anomalies is complex, but prenatal alcohol/ethanol and nicotine exposure
(PEE/PNE) are common causal factors in the US and worldwide. Research has mainly focused on the growth
deficits in neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny following PEE/PNE. However, we recently used high-
resolution imaging to document that PEE results in complementary deficits in blood flow in major cranially-
directed arteries. During the previous project period, we adapted Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to
document that both PEE and PNE resulted in a similar loss of blood flow in the efferent peri-neural vascular
plexus (PNVP). The PNVP and its companion, the sub-ventricular vascular plexus (SVP), give rise to capillaries
that penetrate the parenchyma of the developing brain. In the NSC niche of the fetal ventricular zone (VZ) these
give rise to an atypical class of fenestrated capillaries that contain 50-100 nm-sized trans-endothelial windows.
The function of capillary fenestration in the fetal brain is unknown. Still, in the adult brain, the presence of
fenestrated capillaries in selected circumventricular brain regions facilitates the transfer of systemic
macromolecules into the brain, and persistent activation of brain microglia, and in residual neurogenic niches,
facilitates neurogenesis. Based on preliminary and published data, we hypothesize that prenatal ethanol will
increase brain angiogenesis, capillary fenestration, and microglial immune cell precursor trafficking to the fetal
brain. We further hypothesize that prenatal nicotine will potentiate the alcohol-mediated increase in new blood
vessel formation in the fetal brain and additively increase capillary permeability and immune cell migration into
the NSC niche of the fetal VZ. To test these hypotheses, our team will develop a new sensitive, high-resolution
imaging platform (Aim 1) that combines the complementary benefits of OCT and two-photon light-sheet
microscopy (2pLSM) for in utero time-resolved structural imaging of fetal brain capillary micro-vessels with
molecular specificity. We will also adapt our innovative intravital imaging technology and mouse reporter models
to assess the effects of PEE and/or PNE on the dynamic growth of fetal VZ capillaries and their capacity to
transfer macromolecules from fetal systemic circulation to the brain (Aim 2) and the adhesion and diapedesis of
immune microglial cell precursors into the fetal NSC niche (Aim 3).
This proposal will result in innovative high-resolution imaging tools for in utero fetal imaging and enable for the
first time, dynamic, time-resolved assessment of capillary permeability and monocyte precursor invasion, to fill
a significant gap in our understanding of the genesis of brain growth deficits due to PEE and/or PNE. These
studies will also position us to begin to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological intervention strategies
targeted to prevent or reverse the effects of PEE and PNE on fetuses"

Enhancing the diversity of the biomedical workforce is important for improving educational experiences, fostering
scientific discovery and innovation, enhancing the benefit of research on health disparity populations and
increasing public trust. While academic institutions have an important role in this goal, diversifying the faculty
ranks has been the least successful of all diversity initiatives. The overall goal of the UC San Diego Faculty
Development Program in Infectious Diseases (FDP-ID) termed Raising Advancement and Parity
for Infectious Disease Researchers (RAPID) is to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce.
The UC San Diego RAPID program will provide effective mentorship, courses to develop critical academic skills
and experiences to enhance success of research programs focused on infectious diseases and success in
obtaining extramural funding. RAPID will recruit underrepresented early career academics including junior faculty
and postdoctoral fellows that have secured an initial faculty position from a national pool to participate in
professional and research development activities in a visiting scholar program at UC San Diego. The RAPID
program is directed by two principal investigators (PIs) and three co-investigators (co-Is) from the UC San Diego
School of Medicine with extensive experience in mentoring and training postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior
faculty and success in creating and implementing career development and mentoring programs specifically for
underrepresented early career academics. The PIs / co-Is have successfully led extramurally-funded training
programs; four of the five PIs are actively engaged in NIH-sponsored infectious diseases research; four of the
PIs are from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical workforce. The specific objectives of the UCSD
RAPID program are to enhance the diversity of the biomedical workforce by providing early career academics
from underrepresented racial / ethnic, women and disabled groups with critical academic skills to enhance their
success in developing research programs focused on infectious diseases. We propose three specific aims. Aim
1. To increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce by recruiting underrepresented early career academics
(junior faculty and transitioning postdoctoral fellows) from local and national pools who have infectious diseases
scientific expertise aligned with those of our research mentors. Aim 2. To enhance professional skill development
and effective mentorship of participants by utilizing evidence-based strategies including a faculty research and
career advancement plan, mentoring teams and by improving knowledge and skills in various professional
development areas important for research success. Aim 3. To promote research training and research self-
efficacy of early career academics in infectious diseases research knowledge, skills and strategies through
immersion in activities in the mentees area of interest in infectious disease. RAPID includes PIs /co-Is with
extensive experience in faculty and URM trainee development, a strong cohort of UC San Diego senior faculty
researchers and career mentors from underrepresented backgrounds."

 Xiphophorus fishes serve as long-standing biomedical models for translational research in multiple
disciplines. They are used widely in research topics that connect to the missions of multiple NIH
Institutions/Centers. Xiphophorus fish exhibit several features that no other animal model shares,
including high level of inter-species genetic divergence, capability of producing inter-species hybrids and
backcross hybrids, adaptive phenotypes representing human diseases. Recently accomplished genome
assemblies for several Xiphophorus species, in addition to the specialties of Xiphophorus model, provide the
premise to study non-biased assessment of genetics underlying complex traits associated with diseases in
humans. The primary goal of the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center (XGSC) is to maintain these unique
features and preserve the strength of this model to be used in biomedical research. The XGSC is not only a
resource center hosting many different species, but also the only center that preserves/maintains high level of
tractable genotypic and phenotypic diversity. The XGSC maintains 61 pedigreed lines that belong to 24
Xiphophorus species. It resides at Texas State University and has actively served a broad research
community since 1993. XGSC has a wide international impact. We provide pedigreed fish and material to
investigators in 30 laboratories of 11 countries. Herein this proposal, we focus on continuing successful
operation of the XGSC, enhancing animal husbandry, maintaining relevant resources, and providing
animal husbandry training for the research community, and student training for the host institution.
Proposed enhancement of Xiphophorus resources will leverage the disease-like phenotypes related to
cancer, metabolic disorders and the human disease-associated molecular phenotypes. Innovatively, we
will investigate on the cellular, tissue and organ level, the genetic signaling underlying (a) cancer progression
and (b) metabolic disorder/obesity. We will achieve theses goal by characterizing cell types involved in these
phenotypes on the molecular level which are critically involved in driving disease progression and by
deciphering epigenetic alterations during disease development. We will also (c) characterize alleles that
contribute to metabolic disorder formation. In addition, we will (d) expand disease related resources of
Xiphophorus by studying molecular traits that are associated with various types of human diseases, with a
primary goal of identifying molecular traits that can benefit early disease diagnosis and treatment. The
significance of achieving the goals in the proposal will be the support to continue to maintain irreplaceable
genetic resources and advancing our understanding on the molecular, cellular and organismic level of
genetic interactions associated with human health and diseases. The outcomes of the proposal can
forward our understanding of disease etiology, lead to novel therapeutic strategies, and identify causal or
regulatory alleles that may be utilized as predictors and targets in personalized medicine."
10892694,"The pivotal discovery of RNA viruses, like the bi-segmented, single-stranded arenavirus family, producing
defective interfering particles (DIPs) over 50 years ago prompted investigations on their contribution to viral
pathogenesis and host immunity. However, many basic questions remain, including the molecular basis for
how DIPs are regulated and the contribution of DIPs to virus–host interactions, including the persistence of
zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir host. Our overall goal is to identify the cellular machinery responsible for
regulating arenavirus DIP production and interrogate the impact DIPs have on reservoir fitness. A major
constraint to understanding the true role of DIPs in viral pathogenesis and disease ecology is the lack of tools
to modulate DIP levels in experimental systems. We recently discovered that LCMV uses divergent cellular
pathways to produce standard virus particles versus DIPs. Using reverse genetic systems, we identified
powerful host-driven post-translational modifications (PTMs) that dynamically regulate the production of
infectious versus defective viral particles. These studies enabled us to engineer, for the first time, recombinant
arenaviruses that no long produce DIPs. Our specific objectives will be to use these innovative approaches
and tools to 1) define the mechanism by which host tyrosine kinases and NEDD4 Family E3 ubiquitin ligases
regulate DIP formation and function, 2) expand our global map of arenavirus PTMs that may influence DIP
production, and 3) connect these molecular findings to pathogenesis studies modeling both persistent infection
of the rodent reservoir and acute infection of the rodent or incidental human host. Most RNA viruses that infect
animals produce DIPs, which suggests they are fundamentally important for the maintenance of these viruses
in nature. Our findings will be broadly applicable beyond the Bunyavirales order. Collectively, the completion of
these studies will provide greater resolution on the regulation of DIP production and answer, for the first time,
the role of DIP in viral persistence."

approaches to high quality training and mentoring that keep pace with current issues and scientific advances to
develop a diverse pool of UGs who are motivated and prepared for advanced degrees and research careers.
Elements that make our MARC unique are 1) the unusual combination of a research-intensive institution with a
large UG population encompassing a wide range of identities, and 2) a balanced and holistic approach to
research and training that is grounded in education research coupled with the lived experience of students. We
recognize critical barriers to progress in biomedical research such as a lack of diversity of perspectives in the
research workforce that leave health disparities unaddressed, a paucity of forward-thinking UG programs that
create space for students from UR groups to develop confidence in their research acumen, and too few
institution-based strategies to eliminate systemic inequities. Four objectives outline the new MARC Program
Plan: Objective 1. Engage UGs from UR groups in state-of-the-art research through intensively mentored
assistantships at GSU and externships at partner institutions; Objective 2. Enhance the academic environment
at GSU by supporting honors theses, CURE courses, biotech seminars, and an informal graduate school prep
course; Objective 3. Promote acquisition and recognition of the technical, operational, and professional skills
applicable to biomedical PhD programs and beyond, through professional development workshops, research
presentations, and conference travel; and Objective 4. Maximize comprehensive mentoring and provide
individualized career support. Our long-term goal is to equip MARC scholars with the technical, operational,
and professional skills and dispositions for diverse research careers. Our strategic thrust is to leverage GSU’s
existing state-of-the-art research and education programs in six departments (biology, biomedical science,
chemistry, neuroscience, psychology, and public health) to provide research and life skills, along with
explorations of careers in biomedical science, in collaboration with Emory University, Harvard University,
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and Vanderbilt University. We will evaluate program benchmarks
for progressions toward graduation and advanced degree programs, as well as student development of skills

Myelin sheaths accelerate conduction velocity along axons, and its loss in neurological diseases, such as
multiple sclerosis, leads to devastating disability. The importance of oligodendrocyte function and myelin for
neuron health is also emerging in many neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Therefore, understanding how myelin is formed, remodeled, and regenerated may reveal new strategies with
broad relevance to prevent or rescue neurological disorders. The majority of myelin generates during
neurodevelopment, but recent discoveries demonstrate that new myelin forms following learning and sensory
stimulation in humans and rodent models. Experiments in rodent models show that neuronal activity can
directly stimulate new myelin formation and that new myelin formation is necessary for cognition, learning, and
memory. This emerging form of neuroplasticity, termed activity-dependent myelination, can tune action
potential timing and neural circuitry by adjusting myelination patterns along axons, changing the number,
length, and thickness of myelin sheaths. Myelin sheaths form from oligodendrocytes that extend multiple
processes and dramatically expand their cell surface to wrap axons in spiraling layers of membrane. How does
neuronal activity regulate membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes? I recently discovered that exocytosis
through VAMP2 and VAMP3 drive membrane expansion in oligodendrocytes during neurodevelopment. In
many cell types, VAMP-mediated exocytosis can be stimulated by extracellular stimuli, but the cues that
regulate oligodendrocyte exocytosis are unknown. I hypothesize that neuronal activity stimulates
oligodendrocyte exocytosis to drive activity-dependent myelination within activated circuits. My preliminary data
reveals that neuronal activity increases VAMP3 exocytosis in cultured primary oligodendrocytes by more than
2-fold. In my proposal, I will determine which VAMP proteins in primary oligodendrocytes are stimulated by
neuronal activity (Aim 1.1) and which neuron-derived factors stimulate oligodendrocyte exocytosis (Aim 1.2).
Then, I will obtain new training to investigate how human-derived neuron subtypes affect oligodendrocyte
exocytosis in co-cultures (Aim 1.3). To determine the role of oligodendrocyte exocytosis in vivo, I will inhibit
exocytosis specifically in oligodendrocytes of adult mice via AAVs (Aim 2.1) or Cre-inducible botulinum toxin
(Aim 2.2) and use optogenetic stimulation to induce activity-dependent myelination. I will determine if
oligodendrocyte exocytosis is necessary for activity-dependent myelin changes. Finally, with additional training,
I will test if oligodendrocyte exocytosis is necessary for motor learning, a functional task that requires activity-
dependent myelination (Aim 2.3). Altogether, my aims will uncover key cellular mechanisms that drive activity-
dependent myelination and expand my scientific training to launch an exciting independent research
laboratory. In the long term, my discoveries may provide mechanisms that can be harnessed to stimulate
myelin regeneration or enhance neuroplasticity to change the course of neurological disorders."

Chronic use of commonly used migraine therapies, such as triptans and opioids, can lead to medication overuse
headache (MOH). This is a paradoxical increase in severity of migraine-associated symptoms and headaches
which are refractory to other treatments. Currently, the first-line treatment for MOH is drug cessation. However,
during this abstinence period, patients continue to suffer from severe migraine, and in the case of opioids from
withdrawal; and a majority of MOH patients return to these medications within the first year. Targeted therapies
specifically for MOH would result in better headache management and increased patient quality of life. Our lab
has recently investigated mechanisms of MOH. Through an unbiased peptidomic screen, our lab identified the
neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), as being augmented in preclinical
models of chronic migraine and MOH. Our preliminary data suggests that antagonism of PAC1, a high affinity
PACAP receptor, inhibits allodynia and aura associated with MOH. However, the PACAPergic system is
relatively understudied and there is a lack of selective ligands to the PAC1 receptor. Currently there are only 3
PAC1 inhibitors, and two of them are peptides. Although the small molecule antagonist, PA8, is effective in our
models, it has only moderate potency. The objective of this proposal is to develop novel PAC1 receptor
antagonists for the treatment of MOH. This grant aims to develop a collaboration between the Pradhan,
Majumdar, and Katritch labs. The Pradhan, Katritch and Majumdar labs have expertise in PAC1
pharmacology/behavioral models, computational modeling, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and structure-
based design of drug molecules. In Aim 1, the Katritch group will utilize a combination of virtual ligand screening,
and their new platform based on V-SYNTHES on structures of PAC1 to identify novel molecules with antagonistic
activity at this receptor. As a second avenue, we also propose to optimize the potency of PA8, using structure-
based design, and discover new compounds with improved in vivo activity compared to the parent
(Katritch/Majumdar). In Aim 2 we will pharmacologically characterize promising lead compounds. We will
evaluate PAC1 antagonists for potency and selectivity in cAMP assays in transfected cell lines (Pradhan) as well
as in vitro ADME and pharmacokinetic analysis in plasma and brain (Majumdar). Finally, in Aim 3 we will test the
most promising lead PAC1 antagonists in models of MOH and migraine. We will also perform preliminary tests
exploring adverse CNS effects of lead compounds. This R61 mechanism will allow us to establish a
multidisciplinary and collaborative team to identify and characterize promising lead candidates targeting the
PAC1 receptor for the treatment of MOH."

Transgenic mouse models have been instrumental to research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other human
neurodegenerative disorders. Cognitive and behavioral assessment of AD mouse models provides the ultimate
phenotype for which pathological mechanisms and/or biomarkers can be evaluated, and helps identify
promising targets for further clinical investigation. The veracity and availability of twenty AD mouse lines and
the validity and robustness of their phenotypes are critical to the proposed behavioral, pharmacological and
immunological studies described in Projects 2 and 3 of this PO1 proposal. The overall goal of the
Transgenic/Behavior Core (Core C) is to support the independent and synergistic animal and behavioral
requirements of these Projects. Its specific aims are to 1) establish and maintain transgenic and mutant AD
mouse model lines, 2) perform comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of the AD mouse models and 3)
determine the impact of pharmacological and immunological interventions on specific
cognitive/behavioral processes. To meet these aims, Core C will leverage specialized housing and
behavioral testing facilities in the NYU Rodent Behavior Laboratory (NYU-RBL), as well as dedicated expertise
and personnel to implement a large-scale, comprehensive behavioral phenotyping battery that includes both
“traditional” tests and innovative touchscreen paradigms. These value features of the Core will provide lab-
independent standardization and time/cost-efficiency across the multiple Projects, as well as help maximize the
robustness and clinical translation of AD mouse model phenotyping results."

Project Summary:
The broad, long-term objective of this collaborative project is the discovery of small molecule
therapeutics that can replace antibodies as inhibitors of the PD-1 checkpoint. To date, no small
molecules have been approved for this application, although the benefits of small molecules
over biologicals in drug therapy is clear. This project capitalizes on the existence of a large
collection (up to 30,000 samples) of structurally unique marine microbial metabolites that have
shown to be a solid source for the development of anticancer agents. This collection, available
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, from Dr. William Fenical will be interfaced
with the cancer biology lab of Dr. Yin Lu at the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, to
screen for selective inhibitors using a commercially-available cell-based bioassay for PD-1
binding. When active metabolites are discovered, they will be screened in a variety of secondary
assays to show selective binding. Finally, verified PD-1binding inhibitors will be produced in
multi-milligram amounts by large-scale cultivation and provided to Dr. Lu for evaluation in
mouse and rat xenograph models of select cancers.
Relevance:
This project aims to improve on the immunotherapy of cancer by discovering small molecules
that selectively bind to the protein PD-1, which when bound to PDL-1 is responsible for the
deactivation of the immune system. Replacing the current antibody (protein) therapy with a
small molecule drug is likely to improve treatment efficacy and will clearly reduce drug cost."

 Rod and cone photoreceptors are indispensable for our vision. Their death or dysfunction is an underlying
cause for a vast majority of blinding retina conditions. Key to photoreceptor function is the ability to transmit the
signal that they generate in response to light to other neurons in the retina for processing of visual signals and
their communication to the brain. For this to occur, photoreceptors form elaborate synapses with the
downstream neurons, the bipolar cells (BC). Deficits in synaptic communication between photoreceptors and
bipolar cells are known to cause congenital stationary blindness in humans, various forms of rod/cone
dystrophies and frequent co-morbidity with many other ocular conditions. The long term goal of our collaborative
program is to obtain atomic level view of molecular organization of machinery that enable synaptic
communication of the photoreceptors with the hope to better understand blinding conditions and devising
strategies for their treatment.
 Recent research from our laboratories and others have identified several molecules critical for the
synaptic communication of photoreceptors. We have further discovered that many of these components are
scaffolded into macromolecular assemblies that span the synaptic cleft and physically integrate pre-synaptic
elements of photoreceptors with post-synaptic receptors in BC. Specifically, we found that the postsynaptic
receptor on BC: mGluR6 interacts with two cell-adhesion molecules in photoreceptors: ELFN1 and ELFN2.
Furthermore, the machinery that drives excitation of BC in response to synaptic photoreceptor inputs is
associated with an orphan receptor GPR179 which in turn is integrated with pre-synaptic cell adhesion-like
molecule pikachurin (Pika) in photoreceptors. We also documented that loss of this organization abolishes
synaptic transmission leading to night blindness. However, at the moment we know absolutely nothing about
structural basis of these trans-synaptic complexes.
 Proposed studies aim to fill this gap by determining the atomic structures of the key trans-synaptic
scaffolds: ELFN1-mGluR6 and Pika-GPR179 complexes and probing their biochemical mechanisms. This will
be achieved by highly synergistic international collaboration leveraging expertise in biochemistry and cell biology
of photoreceptor synaptic proteins and recent advances in high resolution cryogenic electron microscopy
(CryoEM) to obtain high resolution molecular structures of the complexes probing their mechanisms at
exceedingly precise level. The premise of this proposal is that understanding synaptic organization of
photoreceptors would lead to novel therapeutic strategies for ameliorating blindness."
10877463,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women have higher rate of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and tend to show a more aggressive profile of AD than
men, with greater pathological tau burden and steeper cognitive decline. The prevalence of AD also differs by
race with higher rates among Black versus White older adults. Yet, very little is known about AD in Black
individuals given their historical exclusion in research. Even less is known about the intersection of race and sex
in AD. In this proposal, we aim to study how sex- and/or race-disparate biological (inflammation, insulin
resistance [IR]) pathways and physical activity potentially contribute to tau accumulation and cognitive decline
specifically among older Black women at-risk for AD. We focus on potentially modifiable risk/protective factors
given the recent surge in evidence that modification of these factors can be highly effective in delaying or even
preventing cognitive decline. Our own preliminary work indicated that women may be more susceptible than men
to the adverse effect of inflammation on levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and cognitive function. There is also
evidence that certain lifestyle factors, including physical activity, have a greater impact on AD-related outcomes
such as tau in women versus men. Given links between physical activity and inflammation, we propose to
investigate the interplay between inflammation and physical activity in their contributions to tau and cognitive
decline in older Black women at risk for AD. Since IR is a key driver of inflammation, and the rates of
prediabetes/diabetes are higher in Black adults, we will examine how IR impacts tau accumulation and cognitive
decline. It is critical to examine these relationships in the context of social determinants of health, which are a
driving factor in health outcomes such as inflammation and IR particularly in Black women. To achieve this, we
are conducting a prospective study that will assess all variables of interest and their interactive pathways. The
study will build upon an ongoing pilot study that will collect these variables in 30 White women by study end
(June, 2022), but will represent a more targeted and less invasive study in order to enhance recruitment in the
understudied yet higher risk group of older Black women. We will recruit Black women at two sites, one
leveraging an existing research registry of Black women in Los Angeles, and the other leveraging local
community connections and previous research experience to create a new cohort in San Diego. We will use a
community-based participatory research approach to recruitment that involves decision making at each level
involving a Community Advisory Board. We will measure inflammatory markers in blood, IR, physical activity and
the Area Deprivation Index as our primary social determinant of interest in 100 Black women at-risk for AD and
relate these measures to changes in cognitive function and accumulation of tau, measured in plasma, over a
two-year period. This project will help to close critical gaps in our understanding of risk factors for AD in Black
women by examining biomarkers and social determinants of health in this under-researched yet highly-
vulnerable group. Furthermore, our findings will inform risk reduction strategies that influence these mechanisms."
10883159,"SUMMARY. Mental health problems are a leading cause of disability among children worldwide and in
Tanzania where research has documented high rates of youth depression, anxiety, and suicide, 43% of the
population is under the age of 15, and access to treatment services is limited. One theoretically important
social driver of youth mental health is the primary school environment. Schools have the potential to foster
cognitive, emotional, and social functioning that, in turn, promotes mental wellbeing. Further, school
experiences are thought to play a critical role in shaping the adaptive systems that enable resilient functioning
in youth who have experienced adversities. As such, intervening to improve school determinants holds promise
as a potentially effective “upstream” prevention approach. Our understanding of what to target for intervention
is limited, however, because has almost no rigorous longitudinal research has been conducted to identify
specific malleable determinants of the school environment that shape mental health. Our long-term goal is to
develop a multicomponent intervention that leverages positive aspects of schools to promote the mental health
of youth in Tanzania. Specific aims of the study are to: (1) develop a culturally meaningful set of measurement
tools to comprehensively assess the primary school environment in Tanzania; (2) examine how different
dimensions of the school environment work to impact mental health trajectories of Tanzanian youth; and (3)
determine how features of the school environment can be leveraged to buffer the impacts of exposure to
childhood adversities (violence exposure and deprivation). To accomplish these aims, we will collect data from
teachers, caregivers, and students in 60 randomly selected primary schools in the Mwanza region of Tanzania.
For aim 1, we will develop a robust set of observational and survey measures of the school environment, using
qualitative research to investigate cultural relevance and a psychometric study to examine the validity and
reliability of the adapted measures. To accomplish Aims 2 and 3, a random sample of 50 5th grade students in
each of the 60 selected schools (total n=3,000) will be surveyed at 6-month intervals over 3 years for a total of
6 assessment waves. Observational assessments of schools and caregiver and teacher surveys will enable
multi-informant assessment of key constructs. Longitudinal mediation models will assess the influence of
school environment factors on mental health and examine emotional, cognitive, and social processes as
explanatory mechanisms (Aim 2). Moderated mediation models will determine whether the negative mental
health impacts of adversities are buffered for children in positive school environments. Qualitative interviews
with parent/child dyads will provide contextualized information about these processes (Aim 3). We expect the
study will have a positive impact by identifying factors in the school environment that can be targeted by whole-
school interventions to promote the mental health of Tanzanian children and inform understanding of how such
interventions can be optimized to buffer the negative impacts of adversity exposure."

Parasitic infections by Trypanosoma brucei spp. undermine public health and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
From the basic science vantage point, discoveries of antigenic variation, trans-splicing, and RNA editing in these
early branching protozoans have contributed fundamental tenets of eukaryotic biology. Notably, work on
mitochondrial U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing introduced the guide RNA concept, a foundation of modern
genome altering technologies. Identification of terminal RNA uridylyltransferases (TUTases) in trypanosomes
has led to recognition of uridylation’s broad significance and diverse cellular roles, ranging from microRNA
turnover in flies to maternal mRNA clearance in mammals. Emerging structural insights establish mitochondrial
U-tailing in T. brucei as the paradigm of RNA processing and decay pathways present in most eukaryotes.
Conversely, the internal U-insertion is a central editing reaction unique to Kinetoplastea. This project will reveal
the mechanisms of TUTase-dependent RNA maturation and editing processes at atomic resolution.
Aim 1 investigates how the TUTase—exonuclease—RNA helicase nexus orchestrates mitochondrial RNA
metabolism. It focuses on protein complexes that couple U-tailing by KRET1 (T1) with degradation, and thereby
govern biogenesis, functionality, and metabolic fates of rRNAs, mRNAs and guide RNAs. Molecular, proteomics,
imaging and cryo-EM approaches will define T1 complexes’ functions, composition, interactomes and structures.
We have identified and will characterize an RNA helicase which links gRNA processing and editing.
Aim 2 examines the structural basis of U-insertion mRNA editing. We have discovered KRET2 (T2) and MEAT1
(M1) and their distinct complexes. By determining in vivo substrates and cryo-EM structures of these assemblies,
we will uncover the mechanisms of editing site selection and U-insertion by divergent T2 and M1 TUTases."

Every day ~50 billion cells undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Efficient recognition and clearance of
these cells is critical for tissue homeostasis in physiology and for its recovery following disease. Initiation of the
apoptotic cascade triggers activation of phospholipid scramblases that externalize the lipid phosphatidylserine
(PS) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Recognition of PS by dedicated receptors (PSRs) on immune
cells is the first and critical step in the clearance of apoptotic cells. Immune cells with activated PSRs create an
immunosuppressive environment that can be exploited by pathogens exposing PS in an immune-camouflage
strategy called apoptotic mimicry. Recent studies implicated members of the XKR protein family in apoptotic
scrambling. Dysfunction of XKR proteins results in an inflammatory environment and autoimmune disorders
while their uncontrolled activation favors oncogenesis and facilitate viral entry. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of XKR function and regulation to understand their physiological roles and their
association with pathology. Currently, only structures of non-functional XKR proteins are available, hindering our
understanding of how these protein mediate PS externalization. In preliminary experiments we show that two
XKR homologues, CED-8 from C. elegans and human XKR4, scramble lipids. Using cryogenic electron
microscopy, we determined the 3.55 Å resolution structure of hXKR4 in a novel, likely active conformation,
providing insights into a potential mechanism for lipid transport. In our 1st aim, we propose to determine the
structures of hXKR4 and CED-8 in different conformations and functional states to determine the molecular
bases of XKR activation. We will use our newly developed biochemical assays to probe and elucidate the
functional implications of these structures. The physiological implications of these mechanisms will be tested in
cell-based measurements. Our 2nd aim is to determine how XKR proteins scramble their surrounding membrane
lipids. Using cryoEM we will directly visualize the hXKR4 and CED-8 scramblases in the context of a membrane
to determine how they interact with and remodel the surrounding bilayer to enable lipid scrambling. Furthermore,
we will investigate how changes in the physicochemical properties of the membrane support different functional
states of these proteins. Our 3rd aim is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of XKR activity. Using in vitro
and cell-based functional assays, we will determine whether and how hXKR4 and CED-8 are directly regulated
by cellular factors, such as processing by apoptotic caspases, phosphorylation, or interactions with of a peptide
derived from the nuclear DNA repair protein XRCC4. Collectively, our studies will lay the foundation for future
investigations of the molecular underpinnings of the XKR scramblases in vivo."

Genome-wide association (GWA) and linkage studies have identified >50 genes significantly associated with
age related macular degeneration (AMD). However, many questions remain. Namely, are the identified GWA
hits disease-causing variants or are they simply closely linked markers? And if the GWA hits are disease-causing
variants, how do disruptions in these molecules lead to the observed pathologies? Further, since AMD is
multifactorial, to what extent do particular combinations of factors precipitate AMD disease phenotypes or
increase disease severity, as has been suggested to be the case in large scale GWA studies, where CFH and
ARMS2/HTRA1 (locus on Chr. 10q26) appear to have synergistic effects on disease risk. Together they explain
>50% of the genetic variability observed in AMD. Furthermore, since ARMS2 and HTRA1 are in strong linkage
disequilibrium, it has been difficult to decipher whether either or both genes contribute to AMD-pathologies.
 The issues raised above can be addressed, in part, with appropriate animal models. Although mice do not
have a macula per se, they faithfully recapitulate many aspects of retinal degenerative diseases and have been
used to learn how disruption of certain molecules lead to AMD-like pathologies. In this application, we will seek
in vivo confirmation of the cell-type and subcellular localization of ARMS2, and establish whether mice bearing
the ARMS2A69S allele independently develop AMD-like sub-phenotypes and explore potential molecular
mechanisms underlying the changes. Finally, because AMD is a multifactorial disease, we will examine if AMD-
associated risk factors such as such as diet or genetic variants, such as CFH risk alleles, can potentiate AMD-
like disease phenotypes.
 Identifying the pathogenic pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease sub-phenotypes, the goal of
this proposal, is critical for developing effective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent,
delay onset or decrease severity of the disease. Animal models serve an important and unique role for furthering
our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of disease, and as a resource to examine tissue pathology and
to test therapeutics that cannot be readily done in humans."

Insufficient sleep predicts substance use and associated psychosocial problems, and puts individuals at a higher
risk for substance use disorders. In fact, our preliminary data suggest that the quality of overall baseline sleep
may influence methamphetamine intake in rhesus monkeys. These findings raise the important possibility that
short sleep increases the probability of enhanced methamphetamine use and/or use disorder. We recently dis-
covered that short sleep is a strikingly prevalent phenotype among adult female rhesus monkeys, with a preva-
lence of nearly 40%. While the biological factors contributing to this particular phenotype remain unknown, al-
tered circadian rhythm of orexin (hypocretin) regulation has been proposed as a key mediator of short sleep
(insomnia) in humans, and our studies suggest that the orexin system is involved in the short sleep phenotype
in female monkeys. Moreover, our recent research also has implicated the orexin system as a potential modu-
lator of both the sleep impairing and reinforcing effects of methamphetamine, suggesting an important mecha-
nistic link between sleep regulation and methamphetamine pharmacology. Based on these observations, the
working hypothesis of this application is that dysregulation of orexin processes and specific orexin
receptor subtypes play a key role in phenotypic short sleep in female monkeys that, in turn, increases
vulnerability to the addictive properties of methamphetamine. Our Research Strategy is organized around
three Specific Aims, and all experiments will be conducted in female short sleepers and female normal sleepers.
Aim 1 will evaluate the hypothesis that dysregulation of orexin processes underlies the short sleep phenotype
in female monkeys via OX2 receptors. We will investigate the effects of novel orexin receptor ligands on electro-
encephalography-based telemetric recordings of sleep-wake cycles, and will evaluate diurnal rhythms of circu-
lating orexin levels in blood. Aim 2 will evaluate the hypothesis that phenotypic short sleep increases vulnerability
to the addictive properties of methamphetamine in female rhesus monkeys. Acquisition of methamphetamine
self-administration will be evaluated across phenotypes, and we will use behavioral economics to investigate the
reinforcing effectiveness of methamphetamine. Aim 3 will evaluate the hypothesis that the reinforcing effects of
methamphetamine in short sleepers are modulated uniquely by the OX2 receptor system. We will investigate
the effects of daytime and nighttime treatments with orexin receptor agonists and antagonists on methampheta-
mine intake in short vs normal sleepers. The research in this application addresses a key topic for public health
by proposing to investigate the effects of short sleep on methamphetamine intake and the orexin mechanisms
involved in this phenomenon."

For breast cancer, skeletal metastases are a major source of the pain, disability and mortality associated with
disease progression. As with other solid tumors metastasizing to bone, breast cancer displays a striking tropism
for vertebral bone, with approximately 2-5 vertebral metastases for every one long bone metastasis, implying
that vertebral-specific factors are key drivers of metastasis. Passive blood flow cannot explain the increased
metastatic tropism for vertebral versus long bones, indicating that unrecognized biologic factors are likely to drive
the high rates of vertebral metastasis observed clinically.
 We have here identified a new skeletal stem cell responsible for generating the osteoblasts that
mineralize and remodel the vertebrae (vertebral skeletal stem cells, vSSCs) and provide evidence that this cell
is a major determinant of vertebral-specific pathology, including the high rates of vertebral metastases observed
clinically. Even after normalizing all anatomic factors through the use of in vivo bone organoids, vSSC-derived
bone tissue recruited tumor cells more efficiently than comparable stem cells from long bones. Targeting loss-
of-function to vSSCs using a mouse cre line developed for this project selectively reduces vertebral metastasis
rates. In both organoid systems and native vertebrae, vSSCs drive high rates of initial vertebral seeding with
tumor cells, indicating that vSSC-driven tropism is a major contributing factor behind the high vertebral metastatic
rates observed in breast cancer. Building upon this observation, we have identified candidate trophic factors
expressed by vSSCs and have generated evidence implicating specific vSSC-derived factors in vertebral
metastatic tropism and outgrowth.
 Here, we will perform key studies needed to advance the rigor, underlying mechanism, clinical relevance
and translational therapeutic impact of this discovery. First, (Aim 1), we will establish the metastatic functions of
this vSSC in the native vertebral environment, including investigating how vSSCs may organize the entire
vertebral metastatic niche and which vSSC-derived cell types contribute to metastasis. Next (Aim 2), we have
identified a candidate vSSC-derived mediator driving metastatic tropism and will here determine how secretion
of this factor is regulated and how it signals to tumor cells to impact metastasis. Lastly (Aim 3), we will develop
the therapeutic impact of this discovery by determining if the human counterparts of vSSCs display a conserved
metastatic function in xenograft systems and by conducting proof-of-concept therapeutic studies of blocking
candidate vSSC-derived metastatic mediators. Altogether, this study will establish that a new stem cell
responsible for forming the vertebrae drives vertebral metastases, thereby offering a new model for the site
specificity of skeletal metastases, an explanation for the high rates of vertebral metastases observed clinically
and new therapeutic opportunities."

Severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur in up to ~60% of melanoma patients treated
with combination (anti-PD1 / anti-CTLA4) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and cause treatment-
related morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology underlying severe irAE development
remains unclear and there is no way in clinical practice to predict who will develop severe toxicities
and who will not. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that clonally diverse activated CD4
memory T cells, and more specifically CXCR5–PD1hi peripheral helper T (Tph) cells, specifically
underpin ICI-mediated toxicity in melanoma patients. To address this hypothesis, we will perform flow
cytometry, CyTOF, scRNA-seq, scV(D)J-seq and immunoSEQ® to broadly assess T and B cell states
in peripheral blood to 1) determine whether Tph levels in pretreatment blood are predictive of severe
irAE development in melanoma patients treated with combination immunotherapy (Aim 1), and 2)
determine whether Tph clonotypes preferentially expand in on-treatment blood and are enriched in
irAE skin lesions during combination immunotherapy in patients who develop severe toxicity (Aim 2).
While the prediction of severe irAEs from peripheral blood will be important clinically, patients who
experience some degree of toxicity have also been shown to have better durable immunotherapy
response rates. Therefore, it will be challenging to make clinical decisions regarding immunotherapy
without also considering the probability of durable response. We will thus utilize cell-free DNA
methylation sequencing to predict 1) immunotherapy toxicity and 2) durable immunotherapy response
concurrently from pre-treatment plasma using both cell-state signatures and an agnostic machine
learning approach, which we will validate in held-out cohorts (Aim 3). By doing so, we will lay the
foundation for future clinical trials where immunotherapy decision-making is guided by the
risk versus benefit of combination immunotherapy using the liquid biopsy biomarkers defined
here. In summary, this study will reveal determinants of irAE development which will form the basis
for liquid biopsy technology to predict both immunotherapy response and toxicity to make treatment
safer and more personalized in the future."

The immune system at mucosal sites has evolved to mediate rapid immunity to invading pathogens, while
limiting over-reactive responses that drive chronic inflammation. Mechanisms of lymphocyte trafficking are
essential for the function and systemic integration of the immune system, and in particular for targeting immune
responses to specific mucosal and epithelial organs and tissues in the body. Despite identification of trafficking
receptors for the small intestines, colon, and skin, we have limited knowledge of mechanisms of lymphocyte
recruitment to the lung and to most non-intestinal mucosal sites. Defining mechanisms controlling organotypic
lymphocyte homing to these tissues which will be critical for developing therapies to control immune
pathologies.
 We have identified a novel lymphocyte chemoattractant receptor and its chemoattractant ligand,
selectively expressed in lung, airways, upper GI tract, genitourinary mucosae and mucosa-associated glands
including the pancreas and salivary glands. Under Aim 1 we will mechanistically probe the receptor-ligand
interactions focusing on the specificity and signaling pathways activated by the novel receptor and its role as a
lymphocyte vs myeloid cell chemotactic receptor. Structure-function studies will identify ligand domains for
receptor binding and activation. Aim 2 will define the regulation of the receptor in the mouse, and its role in
lymphocyte population of and homing to non-lymphoid tissues during homeostasis and in the setting of chronic
multi-organ autoimmune inflammation. The roles of the pathway in immune cell development will be probed in
mixed bone marrow chimeras in which receptor-deficient vs wild type stem cells compete for reconstitution of
immune compartments in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Aim 3 will elucidate the tissue- and cell subset-
specific expression of the receptor and ligand in humans. Regulation of the receptor will be studied in
organotypic lymphocyte development and activation, in homeostasis, and in pulmonary immune challenge and
infection. We will employ innovative approaches and develop new tools to address the fundamental role of
the novel pathway in the immune system, and where possible, translate our findings from mice into humans.
Results from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the systemic organization and
integration of the mucosal immune system. The mechanisms identified will provide the basis for new
approaches to manipulating immunity and inflammation in the lungs and extraintestinal mucosae."
10884211,"Abstract
Opioids are commonly utilized in pain management therapies. Opioids are mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists
that suppress excitatory neurotransmitter release, decrease overall excitability, and hyperpolarize neuronal cells,
resulting in the desired analgesic effect. One of the most common opioids used is hydrocodone. Hydrocodone
is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2D6 through N-demethylation and O-
demethylation to form its primary inactive metabolite, norhydrocodone, and an active metabolite,
hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is further metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 through O-
glucuronidation to its inactive metabolite hydromorphone-3-glucuronide. A growing concern over the past decade
has been the opioid epidemic, where individuals are misusing prescription opioids including hydrocodone that
are often used in combination with other illicit drugs, including cannabis. Our lab and previous studies have
shown that major cannabinoids including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol
(CBN), and the THC metabolites 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), and 11-nor-Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol-carboxylic acid glucuronide (THC-COO-Gluc) inhibit several major drug metabolizing
enzymes. Specifically, THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COO-Gluc, and CBD inhibit CYP2D6, while THC, 11-OH-THC,
and CBD inhibits CYP3A4. Our lab has also shown that THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COO-Gluc, and CBD inhibit
UGT2B7. We hypothesize that major cannabinoids and their metabolites will inhibit hydrocodone metabolism
potentially leading to clinically relevant adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI) in individuals who use them
concomitantly. The proposed study will examine the inhibitory effect of THC, CBD, CBN, 11-OH-THC, 11-COOH-
THC, and THC-COO-Gluc against both wildtype (wt) and prevalent polymorphic variants involved in
hydrocodone metabolism in vitro and examine the potential for DDI in vivo. The proposed research will identify
the cannabinoids/cannabinoid metabolites that inhibit wt drug metabolizing enzymes (Aim 1) and their major
polymorphic variants (Aim 2) that are involved in hydrocodone metabolism. The proposed research will also
include a clinical trial investigating the potential DDI between cannabis and hydrocodone, with the
pharmacokinetic data used to develop DDI models between hydrocodone and cannabis utilizing physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling (Aim 3). These in vitro and in vivo studies will aid in evaluating the
clinical relevance of the potential DDI between cannabis and hydrocodone in humans."

Dr. Stubbs’ long-term career goal is to be an independent clinical researcher and entrepreneur, and to build a track record of translating academic concepts into therapeutics targeting aging and age-related disease.  The specific career development goals outlined in this application include developing expertise in the study of geroscience biomarkers; clinical work with older adults, IND enabling studies for drug development, and translational entrepreneurship. Dr. Stubbs will be supported by a team of academic, industry and business development mentors to accomplish these career development goals. The career development plan and research plan of Dr. Stubbs includes individualized mentorship with her mentorship team, formal coursework, and meetings, and is built around immersion in The Buck Business Development Department, experience in an academic clinical trial of older adults and in an industry drug development program. Dr. Stubbs will use biospecimens from these studies in her Research Plan. The plan will complement and extend Dr. Stubbs’ extensive experience in clinical research with young adults, human physiology, and development of ketone-based consumer food products, to equip her to be an independent entrepreneur-scientist.  The overall objective of the research plan is to identify geroscience biomarkers for use in future ketone-based drug development. Ketones are produced from stored fat during fasting or strenuous exercise and strong preclinical data demonstrates that they can impact lifespan and healthspan by acting as an oxidative fuel and a signaling metabolite. The central hypothesis of this project is that ketone bodies modulate geroscience pathways common to geriatric syndromes including inflammation, senescence, and mitochondrial health. The specific aims of the research plan are to investigate the effects of exogenous ketones on the specific geroscience mechanisms of inflammation, senescence, and mitochondrial health in a rodent model of heart failure and in pre-frail and frail older adults, and to correlate changes in these pathways to functional outcomes.  The application is relevant to NIH and NIA because Dr. Stubbs’ career goal is to leverage an understanding of the multifactorial pathways that regulate aging and longevity to provide translational therapies for the multifactorial geriatric syndromes. The anticipated results of the research plan will advance the progress of ketone-based treatments for heart failure. If successful, Dr. Stubbs’ career will result in the development of multiple interventions for geriatric syndromes, which ultimately leads to greater health and independence in older adults."

Diabetes affects over 30 million Americans, yet its epidemic is still rising at an alarming rate. The
progressive decline of pancreatic β cell function and mass is a hallmark of diabetes, but no medications
prevent this decline. Interestingly, a fasting-mimicking diet known to activate autophagy stops this
decline and reverses diabetes in mice. Accordingly, recent progress has increasingly recognized
autophagy as a potential therapeutic target to treat diabetes because of its role in protecting β cells
against pathogens and metabolic stress. However, the basic nature of β cell autophagy remains poorly
understood, particularly in the molecular process governing autophagic membrane fission. Our recent
data uncover that dynamin, a subfamily of large GTPases known to regulate endocytosis and insulin
secretion, directly alters β cell autophagy. Live-cell imaging suggests that dynamin molecules can
translocate to autolysosomes and drive autolysosome fission. Dynamin deletion causes striking
autophagy defects in β cells in vitro and in vivo. These new findings fuel tremendous interest in
understanding the molecule mechanisms at play throughout the β cell autophagy cycle. We
hypothesize that dynamin plays a direct and crucial role in β cell autophagy flux that has not been
characterized previously. Mechanistically, we suspect that dynamin regulates β cell autophagy through
regulating autolysosome fission and autophagic transport. These processes may be essential to protect
β cells against chronic metabolic stress toward diabetes. To test the hypothesis, we have generated
dynamin isoform-specific mouse models, which allow evaluating dynamin-regulated β cell autophagy
and its protection against metabolic stress associated with diabetes. We have assembled a team with
substantial expertise in β cell biology, super-resolution imaging, biochemical signaling, and diabetes.
We will focus on three specific aims. First, define the role of dynamin in β cell autolysosome fission.
The fission step is necessary for autolysosome-to-lysosome transformation in each autophagic cycle
of β cells, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Second, identify the role of dynamin in
regulating autophagic transport via microtubule modulation. This aim may uncover a previously
unappreciated pathway for dynamin to regulate autophagy in β cells. Third, examine how dynamin
regulates β cell autophagic responses upon metabolic stress in vivo. Together, these studies will
provide new insights into the autophagic turnover in β cells and its regulation by different dynamin
isoforms. The results will advance the fundamental understanding of β cell autophagy cycles that
profoundly impacts islet function and diabetes pathogenesis."
10885017,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) constitutes a growing health crisis. Equally, chronic metabolic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasing, because of the prevalence of obesity and other risk
factors. T2D is a risk factor for ADRD and both T2D and ADRD share common causal mechanisms: insulin
resistance; impaired glucose metabolism; inflammation; dyslipidemia; and impaired cholesterol mobilization. The
APOE4 allele is the greatest genetic risk factor for AD. ApoE4 is poorly lipidated and lipidation of apoE, required
for stability and positive function, is controlled by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1. Deletion of
ABCA1 in FAD mouse models exacerbates pathology and behavioral deficits; and rare human loss-of-function
mutations in ABCA1 increase ADRD risk. ABCA1 is a gene product of liver X receptor (LXR); however, induction
of lipogenesis in the liver (steatosis and triglyceride elevation) by LXR agonists has hindered progress. A
nonlipogenic ABCA1-inducer (NLAI) would address multiple causal factors in T2D and ADRD, including APOE4
risk in AD. We have optimized a phenotypic drug discovery strategy for NLAIs, yielding hit series that enhanced
cholesterol mobilization, attenuated inflammation, and improved biomarkers of glucose metabolism. One hit and
an early lead derived from it (CL2-57), increased ABCA1 and APOE, without upregulating lipogenic genes. CL2-
57 administered orally in the high-fat diet (HFD) model of obesogenic T2D, attenuated insulin resistance, reduced
weight gain, and from full metabolomic analysis improved biomarkers and lipid profiles. Aim 1: To optimize NLAIs.
Phenotypic optimization will be driven by reporter assays (induction of ABCA1 in CCF cells, with minimal effects
on SREBP1c in HepG2 cells) and secondary assays in the testing funnel validated in development of CL2-57.
In silico and in vitro predictors of oral/brain bioavailability and SAR will guide optimization. Validation by
PCR/immunoassay will extend to ABCG1/APOE and FAS/SCD1 in cell cultures. Aim 2: In vivo PK/PD and safety.
NLAI treatment of mice for 3 days ± LPS is sufficient to assess target engagement and pharmacodynamics in
the liver and brain with a safety readout (no triglyceride elevation nor neutropenia) suitable to define PK/PD and
dosing. Aim 3: In vivo efficacy will be measured A) in 5xFAD mice (Aβ, cognition, and disease-associated
microglia) and B) in HFD-treated mice (WT, hAPOE3-KI, and hAPOE4-KI) to identify APOE genotype specific
interactions with HFD and NLAI treatment in vivo and ex vivo in astrocytes and neurons. These mouse models
will establish the efficacy of an NLAI development lead. Aim 4: Pretox and target deconvolution will be used to
identify CYP liabilities and any off-targets that will inform future safety pharmacology. The following Milestones
are proposed: #1 lead NLAI meeting in vitro TPP with brain bioavailability; #2 orally bioavailable lead NLAI that
shows dose-dependent target engagement in the brain without lipogenesis, elevated triglycerides or neutropenia;
#3 nomination of a development lead that meets the in vivo TPP with data on targets and CYPs."
10885018,"A fundamental fact of vision is that our perception of the external world is shaped by a number of
behavioral and contextual factors. These factors include visual selective attention, in which sensory information
is filtered in favor of items that are behaviorally and contextually relevant. In addition, it includes the modulation
of visual processing during saccadic eye movements which occur several times each second. These factors are
known to modulate the processing of visual information and to contribute to adaptive visually guided behavior.
In the primate brain, the visual and oculomotor systems are highly interconnected, and past work has shown that
movement-related signals exert robust influences on visual processing in visual cortex. The current proposal
focuses on addressing key questions concerning the role of gaze control mechanisms in visual selection and
visual stability, two ways in which those mechanisms clearly influence visual perception and cognition. These
questions will be addressed using a broad set of innovative approaches and tools including newly developed,
large-scale, high-density Neuropixels (NP) probes made specifically for use in nonhuman primates. In this first
aim, we will test the role of persistent activity in the selection of visual signals and in visually guided saccades in
a set of key, complementary experiments that include large-scale neurophysiological recordings with primate NP
probes. Our hypothesis is that persistent activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) serves primarily to select the visual
information required to guide saccadic eye movements, and that this function is mediated by dopamine D1Rs.
In the second aim, we will address a major open question regarding the basis of stimulus-driven attention by
testing the contribution of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to the representation of visual salience in the brain, and
to saliency-driven behavior. Experiments in this aim combine the use of reversible inactivation of PPC with large-
scale neurophysiological recordings and behavior. In the third aim, we will address another major open question
regarding the basis of the distortions in vision that occur during saccadic eye movements. We will leverage the
use of large-scale recordings, and the use of reversible parietal inactivation to test the role of PPC in perisaccadic
changes in visual processing within extrastriate visual cortex and the FEF. Overall, our focus on the influence of
gaze control mechanisms on visual processing, combined with our use of state-of-the-art neurophysiological
approaches and causal methods, are likely to produce results that exert a large and sustained impact on our
understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual perception and cognition."
10885020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Chronic pain impacts a fifth of American adults. Integrative pain management (IPM)
interventions including mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, and other methods have demonstrated
improvements in pain and function, and are now included in clinical guidelines for chronic pain conditions.
Despite evidence of efficacy, IPM is not reaching low-income populations at greatest risk for chronic pain and
related opioid overdose. Low-income communities rely on safety-net healthcare facilities to access care, of
which Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are the primary providers. The Integrative Medical Group
Visit (IMGV) for chronic pain is one of a few promising IPM interventions developed specifically for safety-net
settings. The challenge now is to examine effectiveness and implementation of IMGV in FQHC settings, to
address chronic pain and risks associated with opioid use. Goals and Objectives: Dr. Roth’s long-term career
goal is to become an independent investigator evaluating effectiveness and implementation of IPM
interventions to reduce the burden of chronic pain, particularly in low-income communities. This K01 career
development award will allow Dr. Roth to gain advanced skills in conducting trials that can identify successful
implementation strategies for IPM interventions. Career Development Activities: The K01 application will
provide structured didactic and hands-on training that will build on Dr. Roth’s training in community-based
participatory research and foundational implementation science skills, through training in cluster-randomized
trial designs, cost measurement and evaluation, and conducting a multi-site pilot study with FQHCs. The plan
will engage Dr. Roth in robust training activities including mentorship, coursework, research projects,
publishing and presenting, workshops and seminars, grant-writing, and responsible conduct of research.
Mentors: Dr. Roth’s mentorship team consists of accomplished scientists from implementation science, clinical
integrative health research, intervention epidemiology, health economics, and FQHCs. Environment: Dr. Roth
will benefit from a comprehensive research training program and infrastructure based at the UNC School of
Medicine’s Program on Integrative Medicine, the top-ranked UNC Gillings School of Public Health, and the
North Carolina Translational and Clinical and Sciences Institute. The North Carolina Community Health Center
Association will provide training in working with FQHCs. Research: Dr. Roth’s proposed K01 research project
will address the limited access to IPM in FQHC settings serving low-income patients. Dr. Roth will first engage
key stakeholders through implementation mapping to identify and refine implementation strategies (Aim 1).
She will then pilot measures of effectiveness and implementation for IMGV in two FQHCs (one rural, one
urban) in North Carolina (Aim 2). This award will prepare Dr. Roth to submit a future competitive grant
application for a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial of IMGV for chronic pain in FQHC settings."
10885022,"Project Summary
Children exposed to poverty experience poorer health compared to their peers; for children in foster care,
these risks are compounded by maltreatment and out-of-home placement, resulting in even worse physical
and behavioral health outcomes. Variation in healthcare use and health outcomes for foster youth is the result
of the child welfare system, the caregiver, the individual child’s characteristics, and the healthcare system.
Unfortunately, communication across healthcare and child welfare systems is disjointed, compounding health
risk and increasing reactive and emergent healthcare use. The goals of this study are to evaluate the impact of
healthcare delivery models on health outcomes for foster youth and understand factors associated with
variation in healthcare use and health outcomes among children in foster care. To provide a holistic view of
children’s functioning, this study leverages 12 years of linked child welfare and EHR data (N ~ 9,600 patients)
in combination with Medicaid claims data and caregiver and self-reported health status for a subset of youth (N
= 200) to accomplish three aims: 1) Evaluate models of healthcare delivery on healthcare use and health
outcomes among foster youth as a result of: a) mandated visits alone; b) primary care, mandated visits, and
specialty care delivered within the same healthcare system; and c) coordinated information sharing between
healthcare and child welfare systems. 2) Identify causes of variation in healthcare use and health outcomes
related to child welfare system (e.g., foster care status) and caregiver characteristics (e.g., perceptions of
healthcare). 3) Understand how child characteristics (e.g., diagnoses, health risk behaviors, age, gender, race
and ethnicity) contribute to variation in healthcare use and health outcomes over time. This is the most
comprehensive examination of drivers of healthcare use and health outcomes among foster youth to date.
Mechanisms identified through this grant that account for the most variation in health outcomes will be targeted
in future studies evaluating how to modify healthcare delivery practices and collaboration across healthcare
and child welfare systems to improve health outcomes for foster youth. By examining healthcare use and
health outcomes, we will be better positioned to articulate where healthcare systems interventions parlay to
better health outcomes."
10883914,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a rare neurological disorder caused by impaired cortical
neuron migration during early development. While individuals with PNH typically have normal intelligence, many
develop seizures during adolescence, and some may exhibit learning disorders. Neural precursor cell expressed
developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (Nedd4L, also known as Nedd4-2) is a PNH-associated gene with
multiple loss-of-function missense mutations identified in affected individuals. Unlike other PNH-associated
genes that encode cytoskeleton proteins, however, Nedd4L has not shown a clear connection to neuronal
migration. To approach this question, our recent work (Lee et al., EMBO Rep. 2021) showed that knocking out
Nedd4L in forebrain excitatory neurons leads to reduced phosphorylation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing
protein. Dephosphorylation of cofilin enhances its actin-binding affinity, thereby reducing the elongation of actin
filaments, as we have observed in Nedd4L knockout neurons (Lee et al., EMBO Rep. 2021). Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that Nedd4L, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinates certain phosphatases to
promote cofilin phosphorylation, and PNH-associated missense mutations on Nedd4L impair this process and
neuronal migration. In Aim 1, we will first search for the phosphatase that is associated with Nedd4L-dependent
cofilin phosphorylation. We will follow this by determining whether and how the loss of two major isoforms of
Nedd4L impacts neuronal migration and whether promoting cofilin phosphorylation can restore any defects in
neuronal migration. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanism by which three reported PNH-associated missense
mutations in Nedd4L lead to elevated degradation. We will follow this by testing whether stabilizing mutant
Nedd4Ls can restore their functions in promoting neuronal migration and improve other PNH-associated
neuronal phenotypes such as neuronal hyperexcitability. Completion of this project will provide a mechanistic
understanding of how mutations of Nedd4L lead to PNH and will introduce cofilin as a therapeutic target for
Nedd4L-associated PNH."
10884748,"Summary: Dr Nicholls is an Assistant Professor in the Section of Infectious Diseases at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)
and a basic science researcher in the field of phage biology for antibiotic resistant infections. His career goals are to
integrate high quality basic science research with clinical practice to treat patients with resistant bacterial infections. Drug
resistant Pseudomonas has become common and is a global priority for the WHO and CDC. It affects a broad spectrum of
people from children with ventricular assist devices to adults with chronic osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, new antibiotic
development has not kept pace with bacterial evolution, but bacteriophages that can infect these bacteria offer a possible
solution. Dr Nicholls’ goal is to become a leader in the science underlying the phage therapy for these challenging cases.
To accomplish this, he has prepared comprehensive research and career development plans to integrate his clinical
practice and basic science research goals. Dr Nicholls’ career development will be guided by regular meetings with his
primary mentor, Dr Anthony Maresso. Dr Maresso is a leader in the field of bacteriophage biology and founder of the
BCM affiliate TAILΦR Labs, specialising in phages for the treatment of resistant infections. Further guidance to develop
an independent career in will be gathered from biophysicist Dr Andres Oberhauser. Clinical expertise will be brought to
his development by Dr Saima Aslam, a clinician and prominent phage researcher. His research and career development
will be supported by the laboratory facilities of Dr Maresso and the world class collaborative scientific environment of
BCM. Dr Nicholls’ research is divided into 2 specific aims. The first aim is to characterise phage-antibiotic and phage-
phage interactions to maximise planktonic and biofilm killing as well as biomechanical degradation of biofilms. The second
aim to identify phages to selectively reduce the fitness of bacterial survivors and study evolutionary pathways to recover
fitness. These aims are severable in that none depends on the success of the others. However, they all work together to
guide the rational design of phage cocktails to maximise the yield of interactions and select bacterial successors with
weaker phenotypes. This proposal will directly guide phage cocktail development for more effective therapeutics. The
proposal is designed to provide a broad experience in phage biology as well as career development activities to allow Dr
Nicholls to make the difficult transition to independence as a clinician scientist and expert in phage treatment of resistant
infections."
10884749,"Integrating developmental neurotoxicity screening using automated neuro-behavioral,
morphological and neuro-developmental tests in the larval zebrafish
Abstract: Zebrafish is a model that holds immense promise for screening effects of environmental
chemicals on nervous system development and has the potential to reveal pathways of developmental
neurotoxicity (DNT) in order to provide a sound basis for human-risk assessment. Experiments using the
zebrafish for DNT can be broadly categorized as gene expression profiling, neuroimaging and
neurobehavioral assessments. Gene expression profiling studies can be scaled in throughput but
neuroimaging and neurobehavioral experiments are assessed using imaging systems where throughput,
analysis automation and standardization are known bottlenecks. Currently, single-camera systems used
for neurobehavioral assessments can provide 2D behavior metrics but don’t have sufficient resolution to
screen for morphology. Similarly, for neuroimaging assessments, current single objective imagers
step-and-scan over every well to screen an entire well plate in several minutes, but can’t perform
longitudinal assays (for e.g. timelapse). Moreover, no imaging system currently exists to our knowledge
that can assess 3D behavior and lateral morphology of zebrafish at a sufficiently high throughput (> 40
fish at a time). Here we propose to use our novel Multi-Camera Array Microscope (MCAM) Technology
stack to develop an integrated high-throughput imaging system (MCAM-DNT), an innovative
“periscopic”multi-well assay plate and associated analysis software for integrated assessments of
neurobehavioral and neuroimaging experiments on the same system. For neuroimaging, our proposed
system will enable non-invasive monitoring and profiling of changes in regions of expression through
development across an entire well-plate within seconds. For neurobehavior assessments, we will obtain
lateral morphology as well as dorsal morphology, 2D behavior and 3D behavior in an automated fashion
for unmounted and freely swimming fish upto 48 at a time. Lastly, a user facing software will collate
actionable insights from neurobehavior and neuroimaging assessments to present to the user as well as
for downstream analysis. This phase-1 grant is the first step towards establishing the utility of the
MCAM-DNT imaging system and analysis software for DNT screening in model organisms (planaria,
medaka) beyond the zebrafish."

The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide Ariel
A. Salas, MD, MSPH, with the mentorship, training, and research experience needed to become an
independent clinician scientist and leader in neonatal nutrition research. His long-term career goal is to reduce
the burden of postnatal growth failure through novel translational studies and large scale, multi-center clinical
trials of promising dietary interventions that optimize growth, reduce dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and
ultimately improve neurodevelopment. His immediate goal is to acquire the skills needed to conduct a clinical
research program to study the effects of the protein intake and gut microbiome on growth and body
composition of extremely preterm infants (28 weeks of gestation or less). To achieve these goals and transition
to independence, Dr. Salas and his mentors have developed a comprehensive research and career
development plan that includes mentorship from an exceptional team of scientists with proven track records of
successful mentorship; intensive didactic training; and a research plan that is purposefully designed to provide
experiential learning in advanced research methods to study postnatal growth failure and the gut microbiome
of extremely preterm infants. Postnatal growth failure occurs in approximately 60% of the nearly 26,000
extremely preterm infants born every year in the United States. Postnatal growth failure is associated with a
higher risk of adverse health outcomes, particularly when fat mass (FM) gains are higher than fat-free mass
(FFM) gains. Recent work by Dr. Salas suggests that extremely preterm infants unable to tolerate early
progression of enteral feeding volumes during the first 2 weeks after birth have an increased risk of disrupted
maturation of the gut microbiome and an increased risk of postnatal growth failure. In the research plan
outlined in this K23 proposal, Dr. Salas will expand upon this work by 1) investigating the effects of early
postnatal life protein-enriched diets on FFM accretion in extremely preterm infants and 2) identifying maturation
patterns of the gut microbiome that differentiate preterm infants with postnatal growth failure and reduced FFM
accretion from preterm infants with appropriate postnatal growth and normal FFM accretion. This work will
produce novel insights into the pathogenesis of postnatal growth failure in preterm infants and will serve as the
foundation for Dr. Salas to inform his future R01 proposals and discover new, evidence-based approaches to
prevent postnatal growth failure. His career development plan outlines a clear path to gain the knowledge,
skills, and experience needed to become an independent clinician scientist, leader, and innovator in neonatal
nutrition research."
10886680,"ABSTRACT
This proposal is a multi PI proposal that aims to understand how antiviral proteins limit host range. Prior work
has demonstrated that type I interferon (IFN) induced proteins limit primate lentivirus replication in natural and
non-natural hosts. Indeed, our previous studies have led to the discovery of antiviral interferon stimulated
genes (ISGs), elucidated their mechanism of action and uncovered ways in which primate lentiviruses evolve
evade or counteract antiviral proteins. Additionally, we have exploited this knowledge to generate novel
chimeric viruses that better represent the HIV-1 strains circulating in humans for use in non-human primate
models, including a minimally modified HIV-1 strain (stHIV) that can cause AIDS in pigtail macaques when
CD8+ cells are transiently depleted during the acute infection. In this new proposal, we will explore the role of
type I IFN and novel antiviral ISGs in limiting primate lentivirus replication in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 1
will explore the mechanism of action of antiviral ISGs affecting viral entry. Using a CRISPR screen, we have
found novel ISGs whose expression appears to inhibit HIV-1 infection, specifically at the virus entry step.
Knockout of one of these genes enhances HIV-1 infection in a manner that varies dramatically according to the
particular strain from which the Env protein is derived. Importantly, the magnitude of effect of the ISG on HIV-1
infection mediated by a particular Env variant correlates with the sensitivity of a virus carrying that Env variant
to inhibition by type I IFN. We will determine the molecular details of the how IFN/ISGs inhibits HIV-1 entry by
elucidating viral and host determinants of inhibition, across cell types and species, and use imaging and other
approaches to determine how inhibition affects incoming viron fate. We will also determine how novel ISGs
contribute to the differential IFN sensitivity of primary transmitted founder and chronic HIV-1 strains and
adapted/unadapted SHIVs. In Specific Aim 2, we will use newly developed, more effective methods to perturb
type I IFN in macaques to determine the effect of IFN on primate lentivirus replication therein. In particular, we
will determine the effect of type I IFN blockade on stHIV replication and clinical course in pigtail macaques. We
will also use SHIV to determine whether HIV-1 Env variants that exhibit differential type I IFN sensitivity in vitro,
also do so in vivo. Finally, we will determine how type I IFN affects SHIV dissemination and competitiveness
use barcoded SHIVs, bearing IFN/ISG-sensitive and resistant HIV-1 Env proteins, defined in Aim 1, by
determining how efficiently each SHIV disseminates in macaques in the presence and absence of type I IFN
blockade."
10886681,"Viral encephalitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults. Key knowledge gaps
about the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis include how neurotropic viruses target the central nervous system
(CNS), internalize into neurons, and disseminate in the brain. The proposed research uses reovirus, a
genetically tractable double-stranded RNA virus that causes encephalitis and shows promise as an oncolytic
agent, to dissect mechanisms of viral tropism, cell entry, and spread in the CNS. Reovirus strains display
serotype-specific patterns of systemic dissemination and neurologic disease. Serotype 3 (T3) reoviruses are
exquisitely neurotropic, internalize into neurons using macropinocytosis, and spread intracellularly by fast
axonal transport. Reovirus uses β1 integrin to internalize into some types of cells, but its function in neural cell
entry is unknown. Other previously identified reovirus receptors are dispensable for reovirus infection in the
murine CNS. We recently identified a new reovirus receptor, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), that
allows serotype-independent reovirus infection of cultured cells but is required for efficient T3 infection of
neurons and full neurovirulence. Three integrated specific aims are proposed to enhance knowledge of reovirus
neuropathogenesis that may have broader applications to other neurotropic viruses. In Specific Aim 1,
functions of host receptors in reovirus neuropathogenesis will be determined. Biophysical interactions between
PirB and reovirus will be assessed using cryo-electron microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, and structure-
guided mutagenesis. The function of PirB in reovirus disease will be elucidated by comparing infection and
virulence in wild-type (WT) and PirB-null mice. T3 reovirus-specific receptors that couple with PirB for
neurotropism will be identified using CRISPR activation screening. In Specific Aim 2, mechanisms of reovirus
entry into CNS neurons will be defined. The functions of PirB and β1 integrin in reovirus neural entry will be
determined using mutant receptors and receptor-blind viruses. Receptor-dependent control of macropinocytosis
will be elucidated using super-resolution, live-cell, and electron microscopy. Mechanisms of dynein motor
recruitment for reovirus transport within axons will be dissected by investigating interactions between WT and
mutant reovirus receptors and dynein subunits. In Specific Aim 3, the basis of reovirus dissemination in the
CNS will be elucidated. The role of host receptors in reovirus neural transit will be defined using whole-brain
imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction to trace reovirus infection and neural spread in WT and receptor-
null mice. Mechanisms of reovirus transsynaptic transmission will be elucidated using in vitro and in vivo neural
circuits. The effect of altering synaptic activity on reovirus neural transit will be tested using pharmacologic
intervention and chemogenetically altered mice. Taken together, these studies will define mechanisms used by
neurotropic reovirus to infect and disseminate in the brain and may promote further development of reovirus
oncolytics that selectively target the nervous system."
10886682,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms, called schistosomes,
that affects hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest people. The pathology of this disease stems
from the fact that schistosomes can lay hundreds-to-thousands of eggs per day while living in the
blood vessels of their human hosts. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that control
schistosome egg production could present new opportunities to both limit the spread of the disease
and abrogate the pathology caused by the parasite. Interestingly, female schistosomes only become
sexually mature when they are in constant physical contact with a male worm. Indeed, females
grown in the absence of male worms produce no eggs and cause no serious adverse consequences
in their hosts. Although the requirement of male worms for female sexual development was
described almost 100 years ago, there are few insights into how this process is regulated on a
molecular level. A major impediment for addressing this issue is that current culture conditions do not
support schistosome sexual development in vitro. To address this issue we have developed a novel
media formulation that supports male-induced female sexual development and long-term egg
production in vitro. Capitalizing on this medium, we have made two important observations. First, we
find that gene expression changes in females immediately upon pairing with a male worm do not
occur in the reproductive organs, but rather in the parasite’s somatic tissues including neurons and
muscle cells. Second, we identified a transcription factor highly expressed in the nervous system and
muscle cells that is essential for female sexual development after pairing with a male worm. Based
on these data, we hypothesize that somatic non-reproductive cell types in the female worm are
responsible for perceiving the presence of the male worm and in turn regulating the development of
the reproductive organs. Defining the cell types directly responsible for perceiving the presence of
the male worm could provide important clues about the nature of the male-derived signal that controls
female sexual development. Therefore, we will test our central hypothesis in two specific aims. In
Specific Aim 1 we will describe the cellular and molecular response of the reproductive and somatic
tissues of the female worm to pairing with a male worm using basic developmental biology
approaches and single cell RNA sequencing. Specific Aim 2 will utilize RNA interference and single
cell RNA sequencing to discover genes and somatic cell types that are essential for controlling female
maturation and determine how these genes act in concert to coordinate the female response to
pairing with a male. We expect these studies to define the signaling events that stimulate female
maturation and hope they will suggest new therapeutic targets against schistosomes."

How cancer cells co-evolve with their host microenvironment immune cells remains a critical
question in immunotherapy. The Wu lab focuses on the study of antigen-specific interactions
and their involvement in the cellular and molecular pathways underlying anti-tumor immunity.
The DFCI Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory (TIGL) was created to expand technology
and computational capabilities developed within the Wu Lab and provide a dedicated resource
for immunogenomic analysis across different cancer types. My current portfolio of projects is
focused on designing the development of single cell/genomics techniques to understand the
crosstalk between tumor cells and immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment
and the selective pressure they mutually exert on each other. In particular: (i) I have developed
the sensitive and robust rhTCRseq to determine paired alpha and beta-TCR clonotypes in
single cells as well as to perform TCR repertoire analysis in bulk RNA samples. It has already
revealed novel insights regarding the impact of immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccines, on
the generation of antigen-specific immunity, and is being widely applied to the monitoring of
other immunotherapy trials. (ii) For plate-based single-cell analysis and for bulk RNA samples, I
have developed a novel strategy to perform qPCR and transcriptome sequencing. In addition, I
have implemented a droplet-based 10x Genomics platform to study single cell transcriptome
and surface protein expression in the same single cells. (iii) I have expertise in generating
targeted multiplex RNA assays, aimed at simultaneous detection of genotype and transcriptome
information at the single cell level. Altogether these diverse approaches have been and are
being applied to several NCI-funded projects in the Wu Lab. Our new initiatives focus on the
further development and implementation of novel single cell genomics technologies and their

10888206,"Abstract
Glioblastoma is the most malignant and common form of primary central nervous system tumors with high
mortality and resistance to therapy. The presence of Glioma stem cells (GSCs) within the tumor, further
complicates treatment, owing to the role of GSCs in promoting therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence.
Identifying Intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to GSCs maintenance thus influencing tumor growth,
could offer new therapeutic opportunities to treat this fatal disease.
We recently showed that the desaturation of fatty acids (FA) is essential for maintaining GSCs self-renewal,
proliferation, and in vivo tumor initiation properties. Pharmacological targeting of the desaturase enzyme Stearoyl
CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) is particularly toxic due to the accumulation of saturated FA, which promotes apoptotic
cell death, and achieves a remarkable therapeutic outcome in xenograft mouse models. Our results demonstrate
that the dependence of GSCs on FA desaturation presents an exploitable vulnerability to target glioblastoma.
However, regulation mechanisms driving key lipogenic enzymes such as SCD1, as well as the molecular role of
FA in GSCs maintenance and plasticity remains unclear. Based on our preliminary results, we propose that
stress signaling through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress), promotes the transcriptional activation of SCD1
as well as oncogenic signaling pathways downstream of SCD1 that are essential for GSCs maintenance. The
objective of this proposal is to: 1) Define the role of ER stress in activating lipogenesis and oncogenic signaling
that promote GSC self-renewal and increase tumorigenic potential. 2) Exploit the dependency of GSCs on
adaptive ER stress signaling to test targeted therapeutics in patient-derived orthotopic GSCs mouse models.
Upon completion, this work will elucidate novel mechanisms of plasticity and survival in GBM cancer stem cells
and identify novel targeted therapeutics for clinical evaluation in GBM patients."
10888208,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
As people with HIV (PWH) age, chronic comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and poorer cognition
become more prevalent. There exist a disparity in the rates of cerebrovascular disease and dementia among
PWH. Possible contributing factors include disproportionate prevalence of vascular risk factors such as
hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and smoking in PWH. Additionally, the socioeconomic context of PWH
(that includes but is not limited to homophobia, structural racism and societal stigma) may translate in stressors
that may contribute to poorer vascular health. In this proposal, we attempt to fill in the knowledge gap of how
vascular risk factors and socioeconomic stressors may affect cerebrovascular disease and cognition in PWH.
We propose that soluble blood biomarkers of endothelial activation such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), are key
mediators of these relationships, and more importantly, they could be therapeutic targets. In aim 1, we
hypothesize that uncontrolled vascular risk factors and socioeconomic stressors interact with HIV to relate to
increased levels of blood biomarkers of endothelial activation compared to age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched
uninfected controls. In aim 2, we propose that disparities in HIV-related cerebrovascular disease compared to
uninfected controls are mediated by increased levels of blood biomarkers of endothelial activation. In aim 3, we
hypothesize that disparities in MRI-based neurodegeneration and cognition in PWH compared to matched
uninfected controls are mediated by increased levels of blood biomarkers of endothelial activation and MRI-
based cerebrovascular disease. To confirm the central role of endothelial activators over other inflammatory
molecules, we will carry out confirmatory analyses using five models that include LASSO without interaction
terms, Lasso with interaction terms, RF, XGBoost and Model Average. With the execution of these aims, we
will produce rigorous scientific evidence supporting the unique physiopathology of HIV-related cerebrovascular
disease and neurodegeneracion. Furthermore, by establishing endothelial activation as a key pathway in
mediating HIV-related disparities in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration, we will provide
preliminary support to test whether modification of these inflammatory pathways (e.g. TNFα blockade) may
prove beneficial in PWH or in certain subgroups to be identified in this study."
10890129,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Chronic uncontrollable stress can precipitate or exacerbate many highly prevalent and debilitating
neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression and schizophrenia. Such stress-related disorders often
share common motivational symptoms that result in reduced engagement in activities in pursuit of once-
desired outcomes. Dopamine plays critical roles in voluntary movement, motivation, and reward-based
learning, but its precise contribution to self-initiated goal-directed behavior remains poorly understood. The
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is well established in supporting goal-directed behavior and receives prominent
dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Anatomical inputs to these nigrostriatal
dopamine neurons have been identified, but little is known about how this circuitry regulates nigrostriatal
dopamine dynamics during goal-directed action. Furthermore, chronic stress manipulations in rodent models
have revealed complex effects of stress on the adjacent mesolimbic dopamine projections to the ventral
striatum, as well as structural and physiological alterations of corticostriatal inputs to the DMS. However, the
effects of stress on nigrostriatal dopamine and the circuitry regulating it during goal-directed behavior has not
been well characterized.
 The proposed experiments therefore will address these critical gaps by examining nigrostriatal dopamine
transmission (Aim 1) and the striatonigral circuitry regulating these dopamine dynamics (Aim 2) in mice
performing goal-directed behavior. These K99 mentored phase experiments will entail the integration of
modern optogenetic techniques with the candidate's expertise in recording dopamine using fast-scan cyclic
voltammetry, and they will provide opportunities for acquiring advanced technical training with in vivo
electrophysiology and cutting-edge viral circuit-manipulation techniques under the guidance of Dr. Xin Jin
(mentor) and Dr. Ed Callaway (co-mentor). Training in this suite of systems neuroscience tools will permit
subsequent R00 independent phase investigations of how chronic stress alters the functional circuitry
regulating nigrostriatal dopamine during goal-directed actions and more complex cost-benefit decision making
(Aim 3). These experiments will entail distinct stress manipulations implemented following further guidance
from Dr. Byungkook Lim (consultant) and a novel decision-making task adapted from the candidate's doctoral
work examining decisions involving tradeoffs between reward and effort. Collectively, the research proposed in
this Pathway to Independence award will yield unprecedented insight into how chronic stress affects the
circuitry regulating an under-examined dopamine pathway in goal-directed behavior and action selection; it will
provide the technical training and career development to launch the candidate's independent research
program; and it will reveal important additional questions for future investigations of mechanisms supporting
motivated behavior and mental health."
10886393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candidate and Environment: Dr. Rana’s career objective is to establish an independent research program
aimed to develop therapeutic strategies to enhance respiratory function following spinal cord injuries (SCIs). This
proposal has been carefully designed to supplement the candidate’s strong background in SCI neurobiology and
respiratory neurophysiology with the acquisition of additional technical skills to study neuromodulatory therapies
in rodents and will make her ideally suited to succeed on her career path. The University of Florida is an ideal
place for Dr. Rana to achieve these goals since it is home to the Breathing Research and Therapeutics Center
which brings together basic and clinician scientists devoted to understanding and addressing physiological
challenges of respiratory motor control in disease and injury conditions. The core mentoring team consists of Dr.
David Fuller (scientist) and Dr. Emily Fox (clinician-scientist), who are leaders in the field of respiratory motor
control and SCI rehabilitation, and have a track record of successful mentees. Research: Respiratory
complications are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the SCI population. Thus, strategies to target
respiratory motor recovery are urgently needed. Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) is a
non-invasive neuromodulatory therapy that involves the delivery of a constant low-intensity current to target
neural tissue, resulting in increased activation of spinal pathways and motor neuron excitability. However, the
feasibility and efficacy of tsDCS to restore breathing following SCI has never been investigated. We have recently
demonstrated that ampakines (allosteric modulators of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) receptors) enhance diaphragm muscle activation at acute and chronic stages of SCI. Thus, we
hypothesize that 1) tsDCS can safely stimulate diaphragm motor output after incomplete cervical SCI, and 2)
pairing tsDCS with low-dose ampakine promotes neuroplasticity, and therefore, is an effective respiratory
neurorehabilitation approach. We will use a multidisciplinary approach, including controlled neurophysiological
phrenic nerve preparations (Aim 1 & 2) and a comprehensive system to quantify diaphragm activity and overall
ventilation in awake/unrestrained rats (Aim 3 & 4) to accomplish the following aims: 1.) Develop an effective
tsDCS protocol to increase phrenic activation after cervical SCI; 2.) Test whether pairing ampakine therapy with
tsDCS will promote sustained increases in phrenic output; 3.) Test whether tsDCS paired with ampakines can
safely enhance diaphragm EMG output in awake rats with cervical SCI; 4.) Test whether a rehabilitation
paradigm, consisting of daily tsDCS + low-dose ampakine therapy, can promote sustained recovery of diaphragm
activation after cervical SCI. This application encompasses both mentored and independent phases. For the
mentored phase of this application, a strong scientific community and support structure has been set in place.
Together the co-mentors will guide the candidate in developing the necessary skills to complete this work and
transitioning into a career aimed at developing effective strategies to mitigate SCI-inducted motor dysfunction."
10886875,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening and costly condition, affecting ~15% of all hospitalized patients,
including up to 65% of those requiring intensive care. Despite the consequences and expense associated with
AKI, proactive fluid management and dialysis remain the only interventions. Yet, as AKI develops, cells initially
induce protective pathways to maintain their viability. One pathway, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), is
initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and can protect cells from the accumulation of damaged proteins
and oxidative injury, preserving protein homeostasis (“proteostasis”) despite environmental stress. However,
as a result of unmitigated stress, ER stress and UPR activation are cytotoxic, and emerging data suggest that
the UPR may cause AKI. To directly link the UPR to AKI, and to ask if ER stress and the UPR are directly
associated with AKI, a unique inducible nephron-tubule-specific knockout (KO) mouse was created and
characterized. In this model, the gene encoding GRP170, a molecular chaperone that maintains ER
proteostasis, can be deleted at will. The applicant’s published data indicate that GRP170 ablation causes
inappropriate UPR activation and a severe AKI-like phenotype.
To more precisely define how the UPR contributes to AKI, the applicant has recently been focused on
heterozygous GRP170NT+/- mice, which have more subtle UPR activation but are susceptible to kidney injury
only when subjected to an additional renal stressor. Preliminary data indicate a temporal association between
stimulation of one UPR stress sensor, PERK, and early AKI, implying a causal link. Hence this GRP170NT+/-
model is the ideal tool with which to clarify the UPR-AKI relationship, avoiding interference from the
confounding variables that hindered prior in vivo studies. To this end, the first objective of this project is to
discern the mechanism by which PERK drives AKI caused via two clinically-relevant insults: a commonly used
nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic, cisplatin, and Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI). The second objective is to
determine if a preclinical PERK-specific inhibitor ameliorates AKI in vivo. Together, these two approaches will
clarify the role of PERK in AKI and inform development and/or repurposing of PERK-modulating drugs for AKI.
Enhanced experimental training will expand the applicant’s experience with diverse techniques and resources,
including murine and renal tubule epithelial cell culture AKI models, imaging, and transcriptomics. In addition to
technical competence, this award will further develop the applicant’s writing, presenting, mentoring, and
management skills. Training will be realized in the labs of well-established co-mentors with complementary
expertise and a history of educating successful trainees. Training will be enhanced by the exceptional
environment offered at the University of Pittsburgh. Formal coursework, participation in seminars, and
presentations at local and national meetings provide further avenues for professional development. Overall,
these experiences will enhance the applicant’s goal of becoming an independently funding NIH investigator."
10886878,"Project Summary/Abstract
Patients with hospital-onset sepsis (HOS) frequently receive delayed treatment and have nearly 3-fold greater
risk of acute respiratory failure (ARF) and death than patients with community-onset sepsis, yet remain an
understudied population. The current absence of data characterizing heterogeneity in clinical presentation,
ARF risk, and treatment benefit, presents a critical barrier to designing interventions that improve treatment
timing and prevent ARF for the most vulnerable patients. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to build an
independently funded research program advancing precision approaches to HOS and ARF treatment. As an
essential next step, the overall objective of this project is to create new knowledge about HOS heterogeneity
and progression to ARF to inform the future development of treatment strategies tailored to patients’ individual
organ failure risks and anticipated benefits from specific interventions. In preliminary studies, the candidate has
built a retrospective cohort of HOS patients admitted to five organizationally diverse hospitals of an academic
health system, and preliminary analyses have demonstrated an association between timing of antimicrobial
administration for HOS and progression to ARF. This project will expand this cohort in order to complete the
following aims: 1) identify latent phenotypes of HOS illness presentation using consensus k-means clustering
accounting for informative missingness and including baseline patient factors, measures of organ dysfunction
and severity of illness, and measures of degree and rapidity of clinical deterioration, 2) develop a novel model
to predict ARF among patients with HOS using super learner machine learning predictive modeling including
patient factors and physiologic data at sepsis onset; and 3) assess the association of antimicrobial treatment
delays with progression to ARF among patients with HOS using inverse probability of treatment weighting to
account for confounding by indication, and estimate heterogeneity of this effect by underlying ARF risk. To
successfully complete these aims and acquire the necessary skills to transition to research independence, the
candidate has developed a training plan that includes formal didactic training, research seminars, works in
progress, and scientific meeting presentations focused on methods in machine learning, predictive modeling,
and causal inference. Her career development will be supported by close guidance from her mentorship team
who have deep content and methodologic expertise in relevant fields for this work."
10888184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year, nearly 4 million smokers are hospitalized in the US, creating an important opportunity to initiate to-
bacco cessation treatment. However, smoking cessation treatment started in the hospital must continue at least
1 month post-discharge to be effective. Many hospitals refer smokers to state-sponsored tobacco quitlines to
provide counseling follow up. A recent clinical trial found that varenicline use initiated during the hospital stay in
combination with post-discharge quitline support increased smokers’ likelihood of quitting by 78%. Nevertheless,
most inpatient smokers rarely actually register with the quitline, and those who do register participate in very few
sessions. Furthermore, most smokers never fill their prescriptions for post-discharge cessation medications.
Novel approaches are needed to engage hospitalized smokers in medication and counseling to increase their
odds of quitting. Contingency management (CM) intervention provides financial incentives contingent upon ob-
jective evidence of behavior change and is an effective approach to increase engagement in quitline calls and
to increase rates of compliance with nicotine gum. Critical gaps remain in our knowledge about how best to
deploy CM. CM has not been tested for increasing treatment engagement post-hospitalization. Remote delivery
of CM via mobile health (mHealth) has not been tested for smoking cessation treatment. More broadly, CM
approaches for concurrently incentivizing combined interventions (such as pharmacotherapy + behavioral sup-
port) are lacking. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop and test the feasibility and preliminary
efficacy of an mHealth-delivered CM intervention to increase hospitalized smokers’ post-discharge engagement
in counseling and pharmacotherapy. The proposed research study has the following specific aims: 1) develop a
text-based intervention (CounsCM+MedCM) to remotely incentivize engagement in quitline calls and varenicline
utilization among post-discharged smokers; 2) to use mixed methods to understand strengths, weaknesses, and
areas for improvement of CounsCM+MedCM; 3) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
of CounsCM+MedCM compared to noncontingent “yoked” control (NCYC), in a pilot randomized controlled trial.
Dr. Cruvinel is a postdoctoral associate at the University of Kansas Medical Center with experience and training
in interventions to address tobacco, alcohol and other drug use. Dr. Cruvinel’s career goal is to reduce tobacco-
related morbidity and mortality of hospitalized smokers through novel systems of evidence-based care delivery,
with an emphasis on mHealth interventions for underserved populations. The primary training goals of this pro-
posal are to gain skills in pharmaco-and behavioral clinical trials, mHealth intervention development, and to
develop expertise in CM interventions. The results of the proposed research and training plans will facilitate Dr.
Cruvinel's development as an independent investigator and provide preliminary data for a future large-scale
efficacy study."
10888305,"Project Summary: Post-stroke hand impairment is prevalent, persistent, and difficult to treat, with negative
impact on functional ability and independence. One way to improve treatment efficacy is to augment therapy
with peripheral sensory stimulation. While promising, most modalities of sensory stimulation interfere with
natural hand tasks. Thus they are administered prior to therapy, requiring additional time commitment and
hindering patient adherence and implementation. Further, effects diminish after stimulation, weakening its
potency during therapy. To address limitations of existing sensory stimulation and fully leverage the therapeutic
benefits of sensory stimulation, a novel sensory stimulation `TheraBracelet' has been developed: A wristwatch
applies imperceptible vibration during task practice to stimulate the sensorimotor cortex neurons for coherent
firing during hand tasks, leading to enhanced neural communication and hand function recovery. The objective
of this project is to determine if combining TheraBracelet with hand task practice is superior to hand task
practice alone in an adequately powered study. The study design is a double-blinded randomized controlled
trial. Chronic stroke survivors will undergo a standardized hand task-practice therapy program (3 days/week for
6 weeks) with the TheraBracelet device worn on the paretic wrist. The device will deliver vibration for the
treatment group and no vibration for the control group. Double blinding is possible because the treatment
vibration is imperceptible. Evaluation will be performed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of therapy, and 1 month
after. Aim 1: To determine clinical potential of TheraBracelet in improving hand functional recovery.
Hypothesis: Improvement of hand motor function will be greater for the treatment than control. Hand function
will be assessed using the Wolf Motor Function, Box and Block, and Action Research Arm Tests, along with
the quantity/quality of the upper limb use in daily living, abilities for daily activities, and participant feedback.
Aim 2: To determine the effects of TheraBracelet on sensorimotor grip control and neural communication.
Hypothesis: The treatment will enhance sensorimotor grip control and neural communication for hand grip
compared with control. Sensorimotor grip control will be assessed using the well-established biomechanical
measure of digit force directional control and efficient scaling of grip force during grip-and-lift. Neural
communication for hand grip will be quantified as increase in EEG coherence in the cortical sensorimotor
network for grip compared to rest. Secondary analyses will include characterizing the time course of effects
and responder analysis. Impact: This research will determine clinical utility and biomarkers of this novel
stimulation to guide potential translation. This research is translational as this stimulation is implemented in an
aesthetically appealing smartwatch, does not interfere with hand motion, and can be easily integrated in clinical
practice. Enhancing hand function should substantially increase stroke survivors' independence and quality of
life, and reduce caregiver burden."

10887287,"Abstract
The US solid waste industry employed approximately 433,000 workers in 2022, in various roles
including waste collection, sorting, recycling, processing, and disposal. These workers are exposed to
a variety of hazardous chemicals that are components of solid waste, including heavy metals and flame
retardants, and are potentially at risk for adverse health effects associated with these exposures. These
workplaces hire a high percentage of immigrants and racial minorities and are ranked as one of the
most dangerous jobs in the US in 2020. Previous studies have demonstrated elevated body burdens
of certain flame retardants (e.g., PBDEs) in electronic waste workers and elevated exposure to lead
and cadmium in solid waste workers overseas, however no studies to date have evaluated exposure
to heavy metals and flame retardants for solid waste workers in US transfer stations and landfills.
The goal of the current project is to evaluate exposure to and body burden of selected heavy metals
and flame retardants for solid waste workers in transfer stations and landfills in Florida, USA. In a cohort
of 40 solid waste workers, we plan to (i) Characterize levels of metals and flame retardants in blood and
urine and (ii) Assess the inhalation exposures to metals and flame retardants, and the relationship
between those exposures and levels in blood and urine. The expected outputs of this work include
measurements of inhalation exposure and biological levels of heavy metals and flame retardants in US
solid waste workers. The expected outcome of the proposed work is preliminary data and to
motivate and inform the design of a more comprehensive exposure assessment and health
study of solid waste workers and to study the effectiveness of interventions to reduce
exposures for solid waste workers in landfills and sorting stations.
The proposed research directly addresses strategic objective 3 for the NORA Services Sector (reduce
injuries and illnesses among contingent workers); and addresses several cross-sector priorities
including goals for the cancer, reproductive, cardiovascular, and other chronic disease prevention, the
immune, infectious, and dermal disease prevention, as well as the respiratory health cross-sector
agendas. The R2P aspects of this proposal lie in the identification of critical exposures and exposure
pathways for solid waste workers, that can then be mitigated through industrial hygiene interventions."
10887288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With the lack of disease-altering treatment in Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD), timely identification of high-risk individuals and prevention targeting early stages of
cognitive decline, has become a promising approach and a public health priority to reduce the care and cost
burden of AD/ADRD. Over the lifecourse, midlife (age 40-65 years) is a critical and yet understudied period
when cognitive function begins to decline, and the impact of modifiable risk factors (MRFs) becomes
prominent. MRFs and AD/ADRD disproportionately impact race/ethnic minorities in the United States (US).
However, race/ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in AD/ADRD research, and fundamental gaps exist
in understanding the joint role of MRFs, which often co-occur, in race/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging,
especially in midlife. Furthermore, whether the relationships between MRFs and midlife cognitive disparities in
diverse populations are mediated by vascular, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative pathways needs to be
elucidated. The overarching goal of this research program is to enhance our understanding of the roles and
mechanisms of MRFs in race/ethnic disparities in cognition during midlife and explore underlying mechanistic
pathways. Using a feasible and cost-effective approach, this project will leverage the strength of three NIH-
funded longitudinal cohort studies in diverse populations, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults study, the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities, and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s
Prevention. With more than 5,000 Black, Hispanic, and White middle-aged adults, all three cohorts also have
state-of-the-art measurements of MRFs, cognitive function, and markers of vascular, inflammatory, and
neurodegenerative pathways. Innovative and rigorous epidemiologic and statistical approaches will be applied
to 1) create a diverse midlife cohort by harmonizing cognitive measures from the three cohorts, 2) determine
the longitudinal association between MRFs and race/ethnic disparities in cognition during midlife, and 3)
elucidate potential underlying mechanisms. The research program will be complemented by focused training in
1) etiology, epidemiology, and clinical assessment of cognitive aging and AD/ADRD, 2) psychometric methods,
3) machine learning, 4) advanced methods in health disparities. Together the candidate’s research aims,
training activities, and mentorship from a multidisciplinary team led by Dr. Kristine Yaffe, will allow the
candidate to develop a successful independent research program in MRFs and cognitive aging disparities. The
current research plan seeks to provide critical insight into the joint effect of MRFs, cognitive disparities in
midlife, and the underlying mechanisms. Our findings will have the potential to inform new prevention (on
specific MRF clusters) and therapeutic targets (on prioritized mechanistic pathways) to lessen cognitive
disparities among race/ethnic minorities in midlife, a critical time in life when the potential for risk modification
may be the greatest."
10887411,"Project Summary:
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) caused by Aspergillus fumigatus is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in immune-compromised patients despite the availability of antifungal drugs. The global emergence of
azole drug resistance is a major factor contributing to poor disease outcomes; however, azole drug-resistant A.
fumigatus isolates contribute to only about 5% of infections. A major gap in knowledge is how azole sensitive
isolates tolerate azole drugs and contribute to poor disease outcomes with mortality rates in excess of 50%. To
this end, we have identified an uncharacterized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) afu-182 that negatively
correlates with azole drug response and is a driver of azole drug tolerance in the laboratory and clinical
isolates. In this proposal, we will use genomics, genetics, biochemical approaches to define the mechanism of
afu-182 mediated azole drug tolerance in A. fumigatus. In specific Aim 1), we will define the pathways
regulating azole tolerance and afu-182 regulon to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in azole
tolerance. In Aim 2), we will define the afu-182 expression in vivo under azole stress in a murine model of
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Successful completion of proposed aims has tremendous potential to
improve clinical outcomes by defining mechanisms involved in azole tolerance and declassifying binary
resistant/susceptible spectrum for fungal isolates. This will help design better treatment strategies for azole
susceptible infections to achieve better disease outcomes."

The Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) is a national and international leader in cancer research across the cancer
control continuum, with a strong commitment to serving the more than 7.8 million people residing in our 10-
county catchment area in the San Francisco Bay Area through cutting-edge patient-centered cancer care,
innovative research, cancer-focused community outreach and engagement, and impactful policy advocacy (e.g.,
melanoma prevention, tobacco prevention). Our catchment area, where 79% of our patients reside, includes 10
geographically adjacent and highly diverse counties with respect to race/ethnicity, age, immigrant status, and
population density. Community partners, Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) staff, and SCI leadership
defined our high priority cancers for research and control over the short term (breast, lung, liver, pancreas, and
lymphoma) and long term (prostate, colon, and melanoma), as well as priority targets for cancer prevention,
including obesity and tobacco control. Significant accomplishments over the last 3 years include reaching more
than 13,000 community members through education and outreach activities, initiating new community
partnerships with a focus on Black/African American, Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, and LGBTQ+ communities,
facilitating innovative research projects in direct response to community needs, and providing customized
solutions to enhance clinical trials recruitment and retention. To address unmet needs in our catchment area
related to persistent health inequities and access to cancer care services and clinical trials, the SCI has
committed $1 million per year for the next five years to establish a new SCI Office of Cancer Health Equity and
Community Engagement (CHECE). CHECE is led by an executive team with deep and complementary expertise
in health equity research and translation (CHECE Director: Alyce S. Adams, PhD), clinical research and trials
accrual (CHECE Associate Director: Lidia Schapira, MD), and community-based participatory research and
practice (CHECE Associate Director: Lisa Goldman Rosas, PhD, MPH). Working collaboratively with our
Community Advisory Board, 70 community partners, SCI leadership, Stanford Health Care, Stanford Children’s
Health, and leaders in COE across Stanford University, CHECE seeks to improve the impact of COE on the
cancer burden and health equity in our catchment area. This will be accomplished through four main aims: 1)
Understand and monitor the cancer burden, cancer risk factors, and community assets in the catchment area on
an ongoing basis; 2) Develop and sustain bidirectional partnerships to facilitate research and activities that are
relevant to the catchment area; 3) Increase participation of underrepresented minority patients in SCI clinical
trials; and 4) Translate research into practices and policies that decrease the overall cancer burden and promote
health equity within and beyond the catchment area. The short and long-term impact of the proposed activities
will be evaluated using theoretically and empirically supported frameworks in close collaboration with community
partners and SCI leadership."
10887428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental funds provide an essential resource to support the strategic initiatives of the Stanford Cancer
Institute (SCI). During the current funding period, the SCI used Developmental Funds to support innovative
research through a robust pilot project program and for the recruitment of new investigators, including a number
of senior leaders. Funds from the CCSG were leveraged by substantial institutional resources and directed
philanthropy to support both faculty recruitment and pilot projects. The pilot project program has been
significantly expanded to encompass funding for the development of multi-investigator collaborations and to
support new initiatives directed at pancreatic, lung, and women’s cancers, three areas of research that are highly
relevant to meeting the needs of our catchment area. In addition, a new seed grant program initiated in 2020 will
be dedicated to fulfilling the needs of the community. A standing committee, consisting of SCI senior leaders and
the SCI Director, participates in allocating these resources with input from the SCI program leaders and relevant
SCI members. All projects are reviewed for innovation and relevance to the SCI mission under the direction of
the Associate Directors for Basic Science and Community Outreach and Engagement, and all recommendations
for funding are provided to the SCI Director, who makes the final funding decisions.
During the current funding period, the SCI used Developmental Funds to support a total of 73 pilot awards,
amounting to $451,676. These were supplemented by $3,523,324 provided by the SCI from philanthropic or
other funding sources. This funding was spread across the seven research programs and resulted in 21 new
grants totaling $24,497,567 (including $16,058,932 from the NCI) and 53 publications (31 publications in high-
impact journals). The return on investment is 6:1. Developmental funds were also used in the recruitment of 14
new faculty members, including 6 junior faculty and 4 new Associate Directors. The SCI requests $500,000 per
year in developmental funds from the CCSG for the next funding period to be used for additional pilot awards,
faculty recruitment in SCI priority areas, and 2 new staff investigators—one who will further expand the reach of
SCI clinical trials and one who will lead a new SPORE application in lung cancer."

equipment, instrumentation, technical expertise, training, and education—all designed to support highly
innovative cancer research. As a matrix Cancer Center, the SCI is solely responsible for the management of two
Shared Resources and supports nine others that are jointly managed with the School of Medicine (SOM) and
University. CCSG funds are being requested for the support of the following eleven shared resources: Animal
Tumor Models, Biomedical Informatics, Bioscience Screening, Biostatistics, Cancer Imaging, Cell
Sciences Imaging, Flow Cytometry, Genomics, Human Immune Monitoring, Proteomics, and Tissue
Procurement.
In 2020, Dr. Artandi appointed Holden Maecker, PhD, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, as the
Associate Director for Shared Resources. Maecker is also the Director of the Service Centers and Enabling
Technologies for the SOM, providing integration of SCI member needs into the overall shared resource planning
and evaluation process. SCI administration oversees the management and reporting of the Shared Resources
and receives feedback through annual surveys of users and from the Shared Resources internal advisory
boards. The Senior Leadership Cabinet provides oversight for the overall scientific and strategic development of
Shared Resources. Over the current funding period, the $6M amount of funding for the Shared Resources from
the CCSG was augmented by $2.1M annually in SCI institutional support with a strong return on investment as
documented by usage metrics and publications. The CCSG budget contribution to SCI Shared Resources is only
$1.1M (8%) of the total operational budget ($14.4M, including CCSG and SCI funds) for all Shared Resources
in CY20, with the remainder supported by institutional funds and chargebacks or grant support. The SCI requests
$1.5M in annual support for eleven Shared Resources and two developing Shared Resource in the next funding
period, which will be leveraged by additional $2M in SCI funds."

The significant accomplishments of the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) in this funding period—described
throughout this renewal application—are evidence of the effectiveness and productivity of a reconfigured and
highly engaged senior leadership, an enhanced leadership structure, and impactful planning and evaluation
processes. Following his 2018 appointment, the SCI Director, Steven Artandi, MD, PhD, adapted leadership
roles and structure to maximize the impact and contributions of the SCI in a highly matrixed organization. Artandi
has transformed the leadership structure by recruiting and appointing new leaders to key Associate Director
positions and broadened input from across the organization to gain rapid consensus on important strategic goals
and the development of new scientific initiatives. Artandi led the first integrated SCI Strategic Plan
encompassing the tripartite—research, education, and clinical missions. The SCI Strategic Plan identified 5
priority areas: Community Engagement, Population Sciences, Training and Education, Clinical Research, and
Translation Science. Implementation of the SCI Strategic Plan is achieved by the robust leadership structure
comprised of the Director’s Leadership Cabinet, the SCI Executive Committee, which includes the Internal
Advisory Board, the Research Program Leaders Committee, the leaders of the Clinical Research Groups, and
committees for SCI Pilot Awards, Shared Resources, Cancer Research Training and Education, and Community
Outreach and Engagement. External guidance is provided by the External Advisory Board (EAB) and the
Community Advisory Board (CAB). The transformative changes to Leadership, Planning and Evaluation (LP&E)
have enabled numerous impactful accomplishments during this funding period, including: (1) recruitment or
appointment of nine new Associate Directors, (2) appointment of a Deputy Director who is an expert in clinical
research, (3) initiation of a new effort in cancer drug discovery, (4) strengthening of Population Sciences and
forming a Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, (5) development of new SCI Shared Resources,
(6) launching a new CAR-T effort, (7) revising and strengthening the Research Programs, (8) inaugurating an
SCI Office of Cancer Health Equity and Community Engagement, (9) forming the CAB, (10) funding the Seed
Grant Program, in collaboration with the CAB, and Community Ambassador Program, and (11) updating the
membership of the EAB. These accomplishments have enabled the SCI to catalyze its growth in salient metrics,
including $91.3M total peer-reviewed funding, $41.9M NCI funding, and 31% collaborative publications during
this funding period and facilitated an increase in accrual to treatment trials by 17% and to investigator-initiated
trials by more than 50% over the past two years. 69 new faculty recruits became SCI members. During the
current funding period, the LP&E capacity of the SCI has enabled remarkable progress in all aspects of our
research, clinical, training, and community missions."
10887432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) Cancer Clinical Trials Office (CCTO) provides centralized support for the
efficient and effective conduct of high-quality oncology clinical research. The CCTO is led by Joel Neal, MD,
PhD, CCTO Medical Director, who assumed the role in January 2021 following the transition of Heather Wakelee,
MD, into the SCI Deputy Director role, and Elizabeth Anderson, MPH, who was recruited as CCTO Executive
Administrative Director in 2017, following the retirement of her predecessor. The CCTO offers comprehensive,
centralized expertise in protocol development, scientific review, regulatory management, study coordination,
data collection and monitoring, education and training, pre-award financial management, and quality assurance.
Key accomplishments over this funding period include reorganization and expansion of CCTO management and
staff to more effectively serve the 16 SCI Clinical Research Groups, multiple initiatives to improve CCTO staff
recruitment and retention, and implementation of several high-impact technology solutions to increase efficiency
and transparency of CCTO’s work. Data and safety monitoring activities were enhanced in this funding period
with expanded monitoring to include all interventional studies. The SCI Data and Safety Monitoring Plan,
approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in November 2020, provides guidance for the conduct of cancer
clinical trials in accordance with NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) requirements. Over this funding
period, the CCTO has facilitated the development and activation of 631 cancer-related interventional studies,
including an increasingly complex portfolio of studies such as CAR-T and basket and umbrella trials with targeted
treatment interventions. In 2020, the CCTO supported the accrual of 913 participants to interventional trials with
a substantial increase of accruals to Stanford-driven investigator-initiated treatment interventional trials in 2019
and 2020 (34% increase over 2018). Notably, despite constraints posed by COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020
accruals to treatment interventional trials reflect the upward trajectory of accruals, resulting from the myriad
actions taken to strengthen accrual numbers at the SCI, in accordance with the SCI Strategic Plan. The SCI is
committed to serving all residents in our 10-county catchment area. Female participants accrued to treatment
interventional trials closely align with the SCI population and more closely with the SCI catchment area, as does
the accrual of most minority groups. The SCI has implemented new strategies to increase participation of
Black/African American patients through key initiatives aligned with the SCI Strategic Plan and in close
collaboration with the new SCI Office of Cancer Health Equity and Community Engagement. The SCI is actively
engaged in clinical research in patients across the lifespan. In 2020, of the accruals to interventional trials, 9.2%
of participants were less than 18 years of age, and 34.9% of participants were greater than 64 years of age."
10887435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall mission of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to ensure that Stanford Cancer
Institute (SCI) investigators execute clinical research that is scientifically meritorious, well designed,
distributed across a broad range of cancer disciplines and feasible to conduct. The SCI Scientific Review
Committee (SRC) and the disease or modality-oriented Clinical Research Groups (CRGs) together fulfill the
PRMS responsibilities for cancer-related clinical research at the SCI and within Stanford. The CRGs conduct
the first stage of the selection and prioritization of cancer-related clinical trials, and the SRC conducts the
second stage. With the ultimate authority to approve studies, the SRC ensures all cancer-related clinical trials
conducted at the SCI are of the highest scientific merit, align with the priorities of the SCI and are feasible to
conduct. Over this CCSG cycle, the SRC reviewed an average of 140 new studies each year. The initial SRC
study review determination across the grant period was 61% approved, 24% response required, 13% tabled
and 2% rejected. An average of 116 studies were reviewed annually for scientific progress.
The SRC is responsible for routine scientific progress reviews of studies and has the authority to suspend or
close studies due to low accrual, stopping rule violations, changes in scientific relevance or other scientific-
based or compliance-based rationales.
Major improvements to the PRMS were implemented over this CCSG cycle:
· Oversight of PRMS functions was moved under the newly appointed SCI Deputy Director, Heather
 Wakelee, MD, to enhance separation of PRMS from Clinical Protocol and Data Management which
 reports to the Associate Director for Clinical Research, Mark Pegram, MD.
· A study priority scoring tool was implemented by all CRGs to standardize the first-stage review process,
 elucidate the impact of proposed studies and facilitate trial prioritization in alignment with the SCI Strategic
 Plan and catchment area cancer burden and demographics.
· A systematic method to calculate accrual progress utilizing an accrual index was implemented for a more
 effective evaluation of scientific progress, leading to improved action planning.
· Annual review of all interventional studies opened to accrual for 5 years or longer for continued scientific
relevance.
· Enhanced data and safety monitoring plan review was implemented by the SRC to ensure that the
 management plan was commensurate with the risks of the study"

The objective of the Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource (BI-SR) is to provide collaborative and consultative
services to Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) members and thereby to add value in all phases of cancer research.
Consultation is provided on identifying clinical data, both retrospective and prospective, along with associated
omic or trial data as necessary to support the basic and translational research efforts of a discovery-oriented SCI
research community. The BI-SR has developed tools for the retrieval and coding of data for analysis and
visualization with attention to data quality and reproducibility. The BI-SR was split out from the previous
Biostatistics and Research Informatics SR in 2017 and now operates under the direction of Daniel Rubin, MD.
The core resource supported by the BI-SR is the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database (SCIRDB), with
a full menu of services provided by the BI-SR staff for data query and data vending. The SCIRDB database has
continued to be developed to meet the needs of SCI members to collect, integrate, and analyze both identified
and de-identified patient data from the electronic health record (EPIC) and from a wide range of other data
sources, including Pathology, Molecular Diagnostics, clinical trials, and other clinically-related databases. The
BI-SR also provides consultative services to ensure its optimal use. Significant contributions in this funding period
included the introduction of new data (incorporation of imaging and genetic data) and the development of new
software tools for federated learning of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, as well as improvement in data
science infrastructure by commencing migration to the cloud. Members of all programs use the BI-SR, with the
heaviest use coming from the Cancer Therapeutics and Hematologic Malignancies programs. The BI-SR has
engaged in over 250 project consultation requests and provided data to over 100 cancer studies, resulting in
over 15 cancer-focused publications since 2017. Two of these were high-impact publications. The annual budget
of the BI-SR is $746,394, yet the CCSG request is $55,879. Accordingly, the BI-SR leverages extensive
institutional support and seeks only 7% from CCSG funds. The BI-SR is focused on four specific aims: (1) to
maintain and continue to develop the SCI Research Database (SCIRDB) to catalyze cancer research, (2) to
provide SCI members with data science services and technologies to enable cancer research, (3) to develop
infrastructure and data-driven applications to support the needs of cancer disease groups and researchers, and
(4) to educate SCI members about the opportunities BI-SR’s technologies provide for enabling data-driven
cancer discovery and care."
10887441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Bioscience Screening Shared Resource (BS-SR) provides SCI members with the ability to conduct high-
throughput chemical, siRNA, cDNA, and high-content screens for the purpose of drug discovery and target
identification. The BS-SR incorporates instrumentation (purchased with NCRR NIH Instrumentation grants
S10RR019513, S10RR026338, S10OD025004, and S10OD026899), databases, and compound and molecular
libraries to allow SCI members to discover novel molecular targets and identify small molecules that modulate
them. The BS-SR provides access to a fully automated confocal High-Content fluorescent microplate imager
with live cell, fluidics, and phase contrast options, advanced microplate 96- and 384-well head pipetting liquid
handlers, and fluorescence, luminescence, and absorbance multimode microplate readers. The BS-SR has over
130,000 small molecules for compound screens, 15,000 human cDNAs for genomic screens, and whole-genome
siRNA libraries targeting the human genome (the siARRAY whole human genome siRNA library from
Dharmacon targeting 21,000 human genes) and the mouse genome (Qiagen mouse whole-genome siRNA set
V1 against 22,000 genes). Access to the equipment and services are provided efficiently and cost-effectively
through the BS-SR. The BS-SR provides access to new technologies, such as high-throughput organoid screens
and other services to meet the evolving needs of SCI members. Members of all programs use the BS-SR, with
the heaviest use coming from the Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapeutics programs.
The BS-SR participated in nine cancer-focused publications (2 high-impact). The BS-SR will become part of the
new University-led Innovative Medicine Accelerator. Some major investments have already been made (e.g.,
2500 FDA-approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials library) to ensure outstanding support for SCI members in
the future. The annual budget of the BS-SR is $404,790, yet the CCSG request is $104,174. Accordingly, the
BS-SR leverages institutional support and seeks 26% from CCSG funds, which is anticipated to decrease once
BS-SR merges with the new Innovative Medicine Accelerator High-Throughput Screening Knowledge Center.
The BS-SR is focused on three major scientific aims: (1) to allow access to state-of-the-art screening
technologies, (2) to provide data analysis and consultation for high-throughput screens, and (3) to provide cost-
effective and expeditious screening services."
10887445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FC-SR) provides state-of-the-art flow cytometry and cell sorting services
to the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) members. The FC-SR has two locations on the Stanford campus; (1) the
primary site is within the Beckman Center for Genetics and Molecular Medicine on the main campus, and (2) a
smaller satellite facility supports researchers at the nearby School of Medicine Technology and Innovation Park.
In total, FC-SR maintains 7 flow analyzers, 1 mass cytometer, and 9 cell sorters maintained and operated by six
full-time and two part-time staff members. The staff span three ‘generations’ of cytometrists with extensive
knowledge and experience in both technical development of the instrumentation and development of flow
cytometry applications. They promote quality research by providing extensive consultation for experiment design,
including high parameter assay development, instrument use, and data analysis. Since the last review, the FC-
SR continued to acquire new high-end instrumentation, with the most recent purchase of 2 high-parameter
analyzer purchases, one of which was funded by an NIH Instrumentation Grant.
Members of all programs regularly use the FS-SR, with the heaviest use coming from the Cancer Biology and
Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Immunotherapy programs. In 2020, 46% of users were SCI investigators. More
than a quarter of all SCI labs use the sorting, analyzer, and educational/consult services each year, and the FC-
SR has contributed to 57 cancer-focused publications (18 high-impact). The annual budget of the FC-SR is
$1,536,654, yet the CCSG request is $115,133. Accordingly, the CI-SR leverages extensive institutional support
and seeks only 7% from CCSG funds. The FC-SR is focused on two major aims: (1) to provide access to cutting-
edge instrumentation for cell analysis and sorting and (2) to promote high-quality research using cytometric
techniques, including the provision of high-level, cost-effective training and expertise and support development
of new techniques and applications."

The Genomics Shared Resource (G-SR) is a state-of-the-art genomics facility dedicated to providing the latest
genomic research tools at a low cost. The primary focus of the G-SR is to facilitate high-impact cancer research
by SCI members by providing the most advanced genetic and genomic-based tools and standardized assays
using these tools. This goal is accomplished by providing SCI members with unencumbered, comprehensive,
and cost-effective access to these genomics technologies at rapid turn-around times with high-touch, expert
consultation services that cover all aspects of genomics experiments from sample preparation to computational
analysis of data. Major G-SR technologies and services include high-throughput sequencing, single-cell genomic
analysis, spatial genomic analysis, microarray-based analysis, digital and real-time quantitative PCR, multiplex
single-molecule analysis, and all sample preparation services required for these technologies. Expert guidance
with the use of each technology is also provided throughout the entire experimental process, including guidance
with experimental design, data analysis, data archiving and publication. The previous resources of the Stanford
Functional Genomics Facility (SFGF), the Genetics Sequencing Service Center (GSSC), Protein and Nucleic
Acid Facility (PAN), and Genetics Bioinformatics Service Center (GBSC) have been now combined under the
leadership of John Coller, PhD, as the G-SR Director, to provide the full spectrum of services. Michael Snyder,
PhD (PS), is the faculty advisor. Members of all programs regularly use the G-SR, with the heaviest use coming
from the Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Immunotherapy programs. The G-SR contributed
to 46 cancer-focused publications (30 high-impact). The annual budget of the G-SR is $3,652,748, yet the CCSG
request is $183,830. Accordingly, the G-SR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 5% from
CCSG funds. The G-SR is focused on the following major scientific aims: (1) to provide state-of-the-art genomics
capabilities, (2) to facilitate the development of novel experimental methods and technologies, (3) to evaluate
and implement cutting-edge genomics technologies for cancer research, and (4) to provide training on genomics
technologies, experimental assays, and analysis methods. Future plans of the G-SR include expanding cancer-
specific bioinformatics support with the addition of one full-time bioinformatician, expanding high-throughput
sequencing and single-cell genomic capabilities."
10887448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Human Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (HIMC-SR) is focused on state-of-the-art immunological
assays to discover biomarkers of immune competence, diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy or
vaccination. The HIMC-SR has two major scientific aims: (1) to provide standardized, comprehensive immune
monitoring services at the RNA, protein, and cellular levels and (2) to offer immunological data analysis and
consultation services.
The HIMC-SR began as a Stanford service center in 2007 and has grown to one of the five largest service
centers in the School of Medicine. Technology platforms have expanded to include multiple innovative mass
cytometry (CyTOF) panels, highly multiplexed immunoassays using Luminex and Olink platforms, and single-
cell genomics assays, including new BD Rhapsody massively parallel single-cell transcriptomics assays, which
now include nucleic acid-tagged antibodies (AbSeq), T cell receptor targeting (TCRseq), and multiplexed sample
tagging. The HIMC-SR has recently developed novel statistical approaches to address the analysis of the large
data sets generated by our assays and their unique characteristics and data structures that need to be
addressed. These new tools include an R utility to correct for batch effects and non-specific binding in Luminex
assays and a star plot visualization for high-dimensional data such as CyTOF. In 2020, 38% of users were SCI
investigators. Members of all programs regularly use the HIMC-SR, with the heaviest use coming from the
Cancer Immunotherapy and Hematologic Malignancies programs. The HIMC-SR contributed to 18 cancer-
focused publications (5 high-impact). The annual budget of the HIMC-SR is $2,238,919, yet the CCSG request
is $57,355. Accordingly, the HIMC-SR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 3% from CCSG
funds. Future goals of the HIMC-SR include expansion of large-scale single-cell genomics assays on the BD
Rhapsody platform; continued development of CyTOF panels to include more channels and new markers, as
well as novel quality control measures; development of additional statistical tools and expansion of the Statistical
Consulting Service; and further development of the Stanford Data Miner online database to facilitate data
integration and retrieval."
10887579,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: MINORITY ENGAGEMENT CORE 
The Minority Engagement Core (MEC) focuses on the recruitment and retention of African American (AA) 
individuals into ADRC research, clinical trials and brain donation programs. The MEC seeks to decrease the 
knowledge gap about Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) among AA, while increasing participation in basic, clinical, and 
translational research that also acknowledges and explores racial differences. We will follow a community 
based participatory model to design and implement programs of mutual benefit to the ADRC and 
Underrepresented Groups (URG). The Registry for Remembrance (RfR) Community Coalition, established in 
2008, consists of lay and professional groups serving the AA community. The RfR and the MEC work together 
to implement recruitment/retention strategies. The MEC augments but does not duplicate the ongoing 
recruitment activities of the Administrative, Clinical, and ORE Cores, but rather responds to programming and 
community requests and needs specific to the AA community. This intentional and directed focus produces 
trusted relationships that bolster our recruitment to double the number of African-American participants in our 
UDS cohort and other clinical research efforts. The MEC, in collaboration with the Administrative, Clinical, ORE 
and Data Cores, will facilitate the recruitment and retention of AA in ADRC studies, and tailor specific outreach 
to engage AA men and other URG (e.g. Latino and LGBTQ). To increase the understanding of Alzheimer’s 
disease and related dementias by URG healthcare and other allied professionals, we will provide continuing 
education opportunities to improve their capacity for service to those living and dealing with these devastating 
disorders. Our goal of increased URG research participation will be accomplished through the following aims: 
Aim 1. Increase the participation of persons from the African-American community in clinical trials and other 
research at the ADRC. 
Aim 2. Continue outreach, recruitment, and engagement activities centered on capacity-building strategies. 
Aim 3. Develop and evaluate innovative research, recruitment, and engagement activities aimed at enhancing 
the relevance of ADRC research for other ethnic minority and underrepresented groups."
10887841,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex disease involving multiple cell types, leading to a plethora of clinical
manifestations. SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is currently the most lethal complication of
the disease. We have recently reported results of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of lung explants
from patients with SSc-ILD, as well as from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), showing
alterations in gene expression in fibroblast, macrophage (Mφ) and other populations associated with
disease. Although the cellular and molecular changes seen in IPF are largely paralleled in SSc-ILD, SSc-ILD
is not associated with any of the genetic markers of senescence seen in IPF. Instead, patients with SSc
harbor SNPs in genes involved in immune regulation, and develop autoantibodies against a select series of
autoantigens, implicating immune dysregulation. Thus, we hypothesize that immune and inflammatory cells
drive the pathological fibrosis seen in SSc-ILD and that inflammatory interleukins and cytokines activate
differentiation of myofibroblasts. Several cytokines have been implicated in SSc-ILD pathogenesis. Our and
other studies have implicated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) and platelet derived growth factor
(PDGF) in SSc-fibrosis. Interleukin-6 inhibition is an approved for SSc therapy that appears to block Mφ
activation in the skin. Inhibition of IL-13 has recently shown promise as a therapeutic target and expansion of
profibrotic SPP1 Mφs suggest that IL-13 and CSF-1 might block fibrosis. Unfortunately, currently available
murine and in vitro models for SSc fall short of fully and accurately modeling the disease, and thus do not
permit convincing assessments for the roles of these and other soluble mediators in disease pathogenesis.
We propose to test the role of these cytokines in healthy control (HC) and SSc-ILD explant cultures. As
single cell studies of SSc-ILD explant lungs have led to many of our current insights, we propose that single
cell analyses of explant culture of SSc-ILD lungs will provide unprecedented insight into the cellular
interactions and soluble mediators that lead to lung fibrosis. In aim 1 we will refine explant culture
methodologies and examine the effect of the cytokines described above on HC lung cells in explant cultures.
We will compare the effect of these cytokines to the changes in gene expression by fibroblast and Mφ
populations seen in our previous scRNA-seq studies of SSc-ILD. In aim 2 we will establish the effect of
soluble mediators on SSc-ILD explant cells, in this case testing the effects of therapeutic interventions on
gene expression of SSc-ILD lung cell populations. In this setting we anticipate that blocking cytokines or their
receptors will normalize gene expression back toward scRNA-seq gene expression seen in HC lungs. We
anticipate that these studies will not only shed light on the role of these cytokines in disease pathogenesis
but also provide a tractable and predictive pre-clinical model for testing new therapeutics."
10887870,"The mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract is host to a complex community including microbes
and immune cells that converge at the epithelial barrier. Despite nearly constant interaction between
these two populations, homeostasis is largely maintained. This is accomplished, in part, through non-
inflammatory barrier host defense mechanisms, many of which have yet to be explored. Using a well-
established model system of non-inflammatory commensal colonization with Enterococcus faecalis
(EF), we confirmed a significant increase in complement component 3 (C3) gene expression in the
epithelium of the distal small intestine (DSI). Complement has been associated with intestinal cells in
more recent years, but C3 gene expression in the DSI in the absence of inflammatory stimuli has not
been observed until now. Using state of the art spatial transcriptomics, we characterized clusters of
cells in the DSI that were responsible for the increase in C3 gene expression in the DSI and found
that they were made up of enterocytes, Paneth cells and fibroblasts. We also found that C3 protein in
both DSI tissue and luminal contents were present during homeostasis and DSI luminal content C3
increased in response to EF colonization. Within the DSI luminal contents, we showed that
commensal bacteria are bound by C3. Because we found novel cellular expression of C3 in the DSI
during commensal colonization, we hypothesize that C3 produced by gut epithelium is secreted into
the lumen to mediate non-inflammatory commensal-host interaction. To characterize the relevance of
these sources and the role of C3 in the DSI, we propose two aims. Aim 1 will characterize the cellular
sources of intestinal C3 and the specificity of C3 bacterial binding in the DSI lumen. Aim 2 will
investigate the function of C3 in the DSI to facilitate host-microbe homeostasis. Completion of these
aims will drive future mechanistic studies of C3 in the DSI, and its contribution to non-inflammatory
host defense."
10888514,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prevalence and cost of osteoarthritis is astounding, with total osteoarthritis-attributable medical expenditures
and lost earnings surpassing $300 billion in 2013, accounting for more than 10% of healthcare costs. The lack
of disease modifying drugs for osteoarthritis is a significant challenge as they could be particularly beneficial in
post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). This project aims to address this challenge using a novel phenotypic
reporter-based system to identify FDA approved drugs that stimulate lubricin production by human chondrocytes.
This novel drug target, lubricin, has proved effective in viral delivery to the mouse joint, preventing osteoarthritis.
The ability to increase lubricin expression pharmacologically would be of significant value.
Primary human articular chondrocytes were genetically engineered into lubricin reporter cells using a lentiviral
vector. We have confirmed chondrogenic activity and correlation of lubricin expression with Gaussia luciferase
expression. These cells will be used to screen FDA approved drugs for anabolic effects promoting lubricin
expression in a physiologically inspired 3D cartilage model after simulated injury. Hit compounds will be those
that significantly increase expression. We will then further investigate lubricin stimulation with hit compounds
both in vitro and in vivo. A non-invasive knee injury model will be used to create an anterior cruciate ligament
tear. This tear is a common sports injury which, even with repair, results in osteoarthritis in ~50% of cases. Our
studies will treat the mice with intra-articular injections to establish lubricin stimulation as a potential disease
modifying approach.
The expected outcome of this research is to establish anabolic therapies promoting lubricin expression as a
cure/preventative treatment for post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Mechanistic studies, confirming or identifying novel
targets of FDA approved drugs in stimulation of lubricin will be performed. Ultimately, lubricin stimulation through
a pharmacological approach, will be shown to be an effective method to prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis in
both a human in vitro model and an in vivo mouse model."
10890991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This work proposes a multi-site study between Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Johns Hopkins
University (JHU) that will apply novel neuroimaging and angiographic tools to test fundamental hypotheses
regarding how biomarkers of stroke risk, vascular steno-occlusion, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) motion inform
treatment candidacy and pathogenesis in North American patients with idiopathic moyamoya disease (MMD).
MMD has unknown etiology and is characterized by steno-occlusion of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries
and proximal branches, subsequent development of collateral vessels, and more than a seven-fold risk increase
of stroke. Importantly, once thought to be a rare condition affecting primarily females of Asian ethnicity, or more
common as a syndromic complication of other disorders, MMD is being reported with increasing frequency in
North America. While much work has increased our understanding of cerebrovascular disease treatments
generally, MMD etiology remains unknown, animal disease models do not exist, biomarkers that may place
patients at highest risk for stroke have not been conclusively established, and randomized treatment trials have
not been performed. As randomized clinical trials of surgical revascularization vs. medical management are
unethical owing to the benefits that revascularization surgery is believed to confer for many patients, there is
now a need to accurately identify factors that underlie the North American phenotype and develop personalized
signatures of tissue physiology that inform neurological impairment and treatment response in these patients.
To address this need, Radiology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery faculty at VUMC and JHU have developed and
applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiographic tools, on similar MRI and digital subtraction
angiography equipment, to help characterize the spectrum and hemodynamic origins of impairment in North
American MMD patients undergoing these indirect surgical revascularizations. Here, we propose to extend these
promising single center studies to evaluate generalizable and pre-surgical biomarkers of ischemic
symptomatology, surgical response, and cerebral ischemia by leveraging overlapping imaging equipment,
established investigators with ongoing collaborations, and two of the largest North American MMD treatment
centers. Additionally, we will explore new directions in this field, whereby we will evaluate whether neuroimaging
markers of aberrant neurofluid flow provide indicators of impaired cortical hemodynamics. Successful completion
should provide new technologies that can expand the diagnostic and surveillance imaging infrastructure for the
growing number of patients with idiopathic moyamoya disease."
10890963,"ABSTRACT
The goal of the Neurofibromatosis (NF) and Schwannomatosis (SWN) Genes Variant Curation Expert
Panel (VCEP) is to develop, apply, and disseminate variant curation guidelines for genes associated with
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Legius syndrome (LS), and schwannomatosis (SWN), including NF2-related
schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN, formerly known as neurofibromatosis 2) and non-NF2-related schwannomatosis
(non-NF2-SWN). NIH has prioritized identifying genetic variants associated with neurological disease and
inherited susceptibility to cancer and determining their clinical significance for diagnosis and treatment.
NF1 is caused by pathogenic variants (PV) in NF1 whereas LS is caused by PV in SPRED1. SWN is caused
by PV in NF2, SMARCB1 and LZTR1. Patients affected by these neurogenetic tumor suppressor syndromes
are commonly managed together in specialized clinics that provide comprehensive care. Historically, these
syndromes have been diagnosed clinically, but new international guidelines recommend the use of genetic
testing to assist diagnosis. In cancer patients, multigene panels may identify germline variants in NF1, NF2,
SPRED1, SMARCB1, and LZTR1 that are pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) in
persons who may not exhibit clinical features of NF or SWN. Improved variant classification will foster earlier
and more accurate diagnosis and improve treatment for these conditions. A key goal of the VCEP, is to
standardize intepretation of variants in these cancer genes and to reduce the number of VUS.
Currently, there are no gene-specific guidelines for curation of variants associated with NF1, LS, and SWN and
no comprehensive database for these variants. In late 2021, 43 international experts from 14 countries
launched an NF/SWN VCEP. ClinGen has provided Step 2 approval for the VCEP to develop gene-specific
rules for NF1. Funding will allow the VCEP to test proposed rules for NF1 and to create variant curation rules
for NF2 (one of the 73 ACMG Secondary Findings Genes), SMARCB1, LZTR1, and SPRED1.
Our approach is to focus on standardization, not innovation. The Specific Aims of the propsal are to:
 1. Develop gene-specific guidelines for curation of genes associated with NF1, LS, and SWN with the
 guidance of rigorous, established, and standardized ClinGen processes and procedures.
 2. Curate a wide array of simple and challenging variants to ensure that the guidelines developed are able
 to classify known pathogenic and benign variants while reducing the number of VUS.
 3. Reclassify variants curently in the literature and public databases (LOVD and ClinVar) and deposit them
 in ClinVar, making them available to the international community and testing laboratories.
 4. Disseminate these guidelines by publishing them in peer-reviewed journals, thereby making them freely
 available for members of the NF community, academic laboratires, and commercial laboratories.
This project will standardize curation among academic and commercial labs, will improve the diagnosis and
treatment of patients, and will increase the number of curated variants in ClinVar.

The past five years have been transformative for the Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst (UMass). During this period a $95M investment in state-of-the art equipment housed in 30 core facilities
operated by PhD-level center directors and over $400M in new research buildings has revolutionized the
research capacity at our institution. This massive infrastructure growth has been matched with the hiring of over
50 new faculty in the life sciences. During this tremendous expansion we have developed the Biotech Training
Program (BTP) in Applied Life Sciences, which leverages campus investments to provide outstanding training
to a talented group of graduate students to prepare them for careers in the Biotech workforce and related areas.
This training is guided by these objectives: 1) create a scholarly and social environment to facilitate new and
strengthen existing interdisciplinary networks at UMass, particularly those at the interface of engineering and the
life sciences; 2) educate students in the fundamentals of quantitative biotechnology through lecture and
laboratory courses; 3) train students in the commercial impact of biotechnology through a tailored industrial
internship and regular interactions with industrial personnel; 4) provide students with opportunities to improve
interdisciplinary communication, expand career opportunities, and sharpen professional skills; and 5) increase
the number of students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, who pursue careers in biotechnology.
 BTP faculty are recruited not by departmental affiliation, but by membership in the Institute for Applied
Life Sciences (IALS), their research in biotechnology and their commitment to student training. For this reason,
the UMass BTP recruits students from ten PhD programs: Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering,
Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Microbiology, Molecular & Cell Biology, Polymer Science
& Engineering and Veterinary & Animal Sciences. We request ten Trainee slots (matched with three and a half
slots annually from UMass). Traineeships are awarded to students for the 2nd and 3rd years of study during which
students complete the BTP curriculum. Innovative features include the Frontiers in Biotechnology course that is
co-taught by industry personnel; specialized Laboratory Modules in biotechnology-relevant techniques modeled
after professional industry workshops; student-run Journal Club to break down discipline barriers; a new course
in Quantitative Biology, Biostatistics & Data Science to promote modern data analysis fluency for all trainees;
leadership in campus recruiting efforts for a diverse student population and accessibility to disabled students; an
annual Fall Symposium in Biotechnology that offers a unique Biotech Battles experience where students solve
real-world problems guided by industry experts; and targeted partnering with the UMass Office of Professional
Development to provide career exploration and planning for our students. We have established numerous
industrial partnerships to support the hallmark of our BTP, a formal internship in which all Trainees participate.
Together this comprehensive training program prepares students well for a variety of careers in biotechnology."

The ribosome is a complex molecular machine responsible for decoding the mRNA and producing all proteins
in every organism. The process entails the selection of tRNAs, peptide bond formation, tRNA movement by one
codon each elongation cycle, and release of the polypeptide chain. Translation factors are key regulators of
ribosome function, modulating the conformation of the ribosome itself and of tRNAs. Our knowledge of ribosome
functioning has benefited immensely from structural approaches that elucidated mechanisms of translation
elongation and stop codon recognition during termination at a molecular level. Because the ribosome is the
target for most of the clinically useful antibiotics, many structures of the ribosome in complex with the factors and
inhibitors have allowed development of superior antibiotics. Remarkably, however, the mechanisms for two of
the most important steps of protein synthesis, initiation and ribosome recycling, have remained unclear.
Translation initiation and recycling of the ribosome into subunits mark the beginning and the end of the protein
synthesis cycle, and therefore a better understanding of the molecular aspects of these processes could open
the door to new therapeutics. Our recent findings reveal an unsuspected similarity between translation initiation
and ribosome recycling: in both steps, the tRNA in the peptidyl (P) site adopts a highly similar conformation that
is induced by translation factors. Despite this, the fate of the codon-anticodon interaction must be different
because during translation initiation, the start codon is recognized by the initiator tRNA and during recycling, the
codon-anticodon base pairing in the P site is expected to be disrupted. This suggests that the state of base
pairing between the mRNA and the P-site tRNA is a major control element of ribosome functioning, an aspect of
translation that has been so far overlooked. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of ribosome
recycling and translation initiation, we propose to study unconventional aspects of translation. Hence, in Aim 1,
we will determine the molecular mechanism of ribosome recycling in the human pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa that is facilitated by the unorthodox elongation factor G-1A (EF-G1A), a specialized EF-G that
exclusively functions in ribosome recycling. In Aim 2, we will determine how initiation factor 2 (IF2) in P.
aeruginosa recognizes the initiator tRNA independently of the formylation state of the methionine residue. In Aim
3, we will characterize how a codon-anticodon mispair with the initiator tRNA in the P site allosterically triggers
a “quality check” by the ribosome that alters the decoding properties of the aminoacyl (A) site. These aims will
be accomplished using multidisciplinary approaches, including state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-
EM) and X-ray crystallography of large functional ribosome complexes, together with biochemical methods such
as stopped flow kinetic experiments and ribosome binding assays. The anticipated findings will fill important gaps
in knowledge of ribosome functioning and may offer unsuspected opportunities for structure-guided development
of new inhibitors of protein synthesis."

Males are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at least four times as frequently as females, but the
molecular underpinnings of male predominance remain elusive. Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei
(RN) extend axonal projections throughout the brain and regulate many essential brain function, including social
behaviors. Importantly, abnormal development of the 5-HT system has been described in ASD. 5-HT signaling
in the brain differs in males and females, but molecular mechanisms regulating sex-dependent 5-HT synaptic
function are largely unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate molecular mechanisms
underlying sex-dependent 5-HT synapse development and function, and determine sex-dependent effects of 5-
HT on social behavior by focusing on the trans-synaptic molecules Neurexins (Nrxns), a well-accepted risk factor
for neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD.
 The formation and regulation of synapses are fundamental biological processes in brain development and
function. These events require trans-synaptic protein-protein interactions to functionally regulate pre- and
postsynaptic structures that determine synaptic function. Neurexins (Nrxns) are presynaptic cell-adhesion
molecules and involved in synapse formation and regulation through trans-synaptic protein interactions with
postsynaptic adhesion molecules such as neuroligins. Importantly, Nrxn and 5-HT mutant mouse models display
deficits in social cognitive behaviors which are reminiscent of ASD. Despite evidence that synapse specification
relies on Nrxn function and that appropriate 5-HT signaling impacts social cognitive behaviors, the role of Nrxns
in 5-HT synaptic transmission and sex-dependent Nrxn functions is unknown.
 Our central hypothesis is that the 5-HT system undergoes sex-specific modulation or development. To
test this hypothesis, we will identify how Nrxn proteins specifically shape the development and function of the 5-
HT system in males and females. This will reveal a previously unexplored 5-HT system architecture that shapes
5-HT neurotransmission and behavior. We will determine i) Nrxn gene(s) important for sex-dependent
development of 5-HT release in the RN and hippocampus (Aim 1), ii) Nrxn gene(s) important for sex-dependent
development of 5-HT system structure in the hippocampus (Aim 2), and iii) Nrxn gene(s) important for sex-
dependent social behavior (Aim 3).
 We anticipate that our investigation of sex-specific consequences of abnormal 5-HT signaling will profoundly
advance our understanding of sex-specific behaviors. Our work should thus contribute to the elucidation of the
molecular mechanisms that contribute to the male prevalence of ASD, as well as identify novel therapeutic
targets to treat cognitive behavioral deficits in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD."

The benefits of precision oncology advances in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been shared by all individuals.
Prognosis among minority groups remains stubbornly low in comparison to non-Hispanic White (NHW)
individuals. Immunotherapy has arguably been the most important advance in treatment for CRC in this past
decade. This is particularly relevant for microsatellite instable tumors that harbor high mutational and neoantigen
burden, where immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are highly effective and FDA-approved. However, despite
dramatic activity in some CRC patients (including evidence that African American (AA) patients may exhibit better
responses to ICIs), a much larger fraction of patients do not respond. As a result, extensive efforts to understand
and manipulate the tumor immune microenvironment features that influence response to ICIs and other targeted
therapies are ongoing and forthcoming. Also needed are studies to identify unique molecular targets for
developing new precision medicine interventions. An underexplored molecular mechanism with potential to
advance the fields of immune-oncology and targeted therapy is RNA splicing, a key step in gene expression that
generates multiple ‘alternative’ mRNA transcripts, encoding functionally distinct protein isoforms that expands
the functional repertoire of the genome. When dysregulated, in cancer, RNA splicing can result in pathogenic
variants and immunogenic neoantigens. When neoantigens are present in high abundance, ICIs are most
effective. The significance of RNA splicing in CRC is supported by a study demonstrating that splice neoantigens
enhanced ICI blockade in a mouse model and studies showing that pathogenic RNA splice variants can drive
every hallmark of cancer, with potential to be therapeutically targeted. Mounting evidence demonstrates that
RNA splicing events are influenced by genetic ancestry and are important in CRC, including our recent work
identifying race- and ancestry-related RNA splicing associated with cancer biology, therapeutic response and
survival. Our goal is to understand the contribution of RNA splicing events to disparities in treatment response
and outcomes in CRC. Quantifying how race, ethnicity and ancestry influence the transcriptome and outcomes
will generate much-needed knowledge in CRC disparities. Our proposal leverages existing diverse cohorts with
biospecimens and annotated data including the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3), the Detroit
Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We will address three aims:
(1) characterize expression patterns of alternative mRNAs and genes encoding splicing factors by genetic
ancestry and across self-reported racial and ethnic groups (250 AA, 250 Hispanic/Latino and 250 NHW patients);
(2) examine the role of RNA splicing in tumor-associated immune responses; and (3) determine the functional
consequences of expression of prioritized RNA splice variants with respect to CRC biology in vitro and in vivo
(using CRISPR/Cas9 genome edited CRC cell lines). This project will be the first of its kind to relate alternative
mRNA species, neoantigens, and CRC outcomes considering the influence of genetic ancestry."

 The purpose of this study is to expand measurement-based psychiatric care across 6 early
psychosis treatment teams in Minnesota, each providing coordinated specialty care and in total serving 200
individuals per year. Our first goal is to efficiently deploy valid longitudinal outcome measures across each
team, implement state-of-the-art informatics tools, and aggregate pooled data to inform and support
program evaluation activities as well as novel data-driven analytics. Our second goal is to perform a
practice-based research project designed to answer two questions: 1) Does a structured personalized
feedback session that includes an explicit focus on cognition and motivated behavior provide benefit to
stakeholders--service users, family members, and primary clinicians? 2) Can cognition and motivated
behavior be addressed as key treatment goals within real-world settings, using a 12-week mobile
intervention program?
 Our central scientific premise is that cognitive dysfunction and impaired motivated behavior are
critical unmet therapeutic needs in early psychosis. We have shown that auditory cognitive training can be
successfully delivered on a mobile device to individuals with early schizophrenia, resulting in significant
gains in global cognition that endure 6 months after the end of the intervention. We have also demonstrated
that the addition of social cognition training drives improvements in measures of motivated behavior. More
recently, we demonstrated that a 12-week mobile digital health coaching and social networking app
designed to target motivated behavior in early psychosis resulted in significantly greater improvements in
self-reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self-efficacy, and a trend towards improved motivation/pleasure
and negative symptoms (compared to a wait-list control). These improvements were maintained when re-
assessed 3 months after the end of the trial. Based on this work and on our experience running successful
coordinated specialty care teams, our project will address the following two aims:
 Aim 1: Establish highly reliable measurement-based psychiatric care for 200 early psychosis individuals
per year across 6 clinical teams; Harness clinical encounter data to perform novel data-driven trajectory
analyses, predictive modeling, and causal discovery analyses.
 Aim 2: Investigate potential benefits of identifying cognitive functioning and motivated behavior as
explicit treatment targets for individuals entering care; Study a well-defined 12-week mobile intervention
program to address these targets."

The Population Research Institute (PRI) and Graduate Program in Demography at the Pennsylvania State
University request a five-year renewal of our NICHD T32 training program in population studies, with a focus
on Social Environments and Population Health. We request support for 5 predoctoral and 2
postdoctoral training slots for each year of our grant. This is an increase from 4 predoctoral and 1
postdoctoral trainees from our last application because we have expanded the number of participating faculty
members in this training effort from 29 to 36 and participating academic programs from 3 to 6 due to new
faculty hires and new connections across the university. We draw upon the strengths of our innovative,
multidisciplinary, dual-degree Ph.D. Graduate Program in Demography; other participating programs,
including Sociology, Human Development and Family Studies, Anthropology, Rural Sociology, and Health
Policy and Administration; and the Population Research Institute (PRI). This combination makes Penn State a

program integrates strong training in demography (demographic theory, methods, and fertility,
health/mortality, and migration) with population health perspectives and methods from several programs. The
postdoctoral program likewise is focused on enhancing research and training in social environments and
population health. Predoctoral trainees are recruited from the approximately 263 annual applicants to, and
students currently enrolled in, the five participating academic departments that partner with the signature
Dual Degree program in Demography. Over the past ten years of our T32 grant, 100 percent of NICHD pre-
and postdoctoral trainees have either been awarded their dual-degree Ph.D. in Demography or completed their
program, or are currently enrolled and on track to successfully complete their program. Of the 30 previously
appointed trainees who graduated, 87 percent are currently working in research or research-related
fields, or pursuing further research training. Our trainees have moved into positions in academia,
government, and research and policy organizations, where they continue to produce high quality research and
publications, and influence national programs and policies that affect the health and well-being of families,

10894399,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for ~2.5 million emergency visits in the US each year and is a major public health concern. Individuals who experience TBI are at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Millions of individuals who play contact sports or serve in the military are exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and are at increased risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Our studies show that the neuropathological substrate of trauma-related dementia is heterogeneous with varying degrees of beta-amyloid, phosphorylated tau, pTDP-43, and alpha-synuclein deposition, atrophy, vascular changes, axonal and myelin loss, astrocytosis, and neuroinflammation. The type, frequency, severity, and timing of TBI and other genetic and non-genetic factors influence long-term outcomes. RHI and TBI have not been sufficiently studied in neurodegenerative brain banks, consequently, RHI and TBI prevalence, their unique contribution to AD, ADRD, CTE, and other pathologies, and their resulting clinical syndromes are not well understood. In addition, scientific research on the adverse effects of RHI and TBI exerts a tremendous effect on the public, including family decisions regarding brain donation and participation in contact sports. To address this major public health concern, this U01 will answer the following critical needs: to determine the relationship of RHI and TBI to AD, ADRD, CTE, and other pathologies, to identify the neuropathological phenotype of post-traumatic neurodegeneration, to establish the prevalence of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and CTE, to define the relationship of RHI and TBI to cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and parkinsonism, and to learn the impact of this scientific research on donor caregiver and families regarding the brain donation process, receipt of diagnosis, and decisions about contact sport participation. This U01 will leverage the infrastructure of our successful Traumatic Brain Injury and Repetitive Head Impacts: Contributions to AD, ADRD and CTE Neuropathology and Resulting Clinical Syndromes (McKee PI: U54NS115266) and Understanding Neurological Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) studies (U01NS086659, R01AG057902). We have harmonized 6 novel brain banks and amassed 3109 well-characterized brains including (1120 (36%) exposed to RHI/TBI) - the largest collection of its kind in the world. The overarching hypotheses are: RHI and TBI will have distinct associations with AD, ADRD, CTE, and other pathologies; these effects will be modified by genetic (APOE ε4, TMEM106b, MAPT) and non-genetic (age, cardiovascular disease, social determinants of health (SDOH)); these pathologies will have direct associations with cognitive, neuropsychiatric, functional, motor and structural MRI outcomes (T1, FLAIR); and this research will impact donor caregiver and family decisions regarding brain donation and contact sport participation. Through this U01 proposal, we will lay the foundation for future strategies to intervene, prevent, and treat TBI-related neurodegeneration and CTE."

Candidate: My career goal is to improve the wellbeing of older adults with multiple chronic conditions and
polypharmacy by developing and rigorously testing rational strategies to improve medication prescribing
practices; and to become an independent clinician investigator and national leader in Geriatric Cardiology. This
area is particularly relevant for me as a heart failure cardiologist, as I care for older adults who almost
universally have multiple chronic conditions and polypharmacy. My track record as an emerging leader in this
area is evidenced by multiple lead- and senior-author manuscripts, 4 grants as the Principal Investigator
including a GEMSSTAR, my position as the Founding Director of the Weill Cornell Heart Failure with
Preserved Ejection (HFpEF) Program for the Aging, and my role as the Chair of the American College of
Cardiology Geriatric Cardiology Section Early Career Professionals Working Group. Mentors and Environment:
This project will be conducted under the mentorship of 4 well-funded investigators who will contribute their
complementary expertise in Geriatrics (Mark Lachs), Geriatric Cardiology (Mathew Maurer),
Implementation Science (Monika Safford), and N-of-1 trials (Ian Kronish). Advisors in deprescribing, shared
decision making, and biostatistics will provide additional content expertise to ensure the success of the
proposed project and catalyze my career development. This project will take place within the supportive
environment of Weill Cornell Medicine, which has demonstrated a deep commitment to my development as a
clinician-investigator for the past several years. Mentored Research Project: Despite its role as an integral part
of patient-centric and goal-concordant prescribing practice, deprescribing is seldom incorporated into clinical
practice due to several barriers. To improve patient-centered medication management, there is a need to
develop processes that can overcome these barriers. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether N-
of-1 trials—as a pragmatic patient-centered approach to medication optimization that can overcome key
barriers of deprescribing— can lead to increased patient confidence regarding the decision to continue or
discontinue a medication. To achieve this, I will: 1) determine key features of a feasible and pragmatic protocol
for deprescribing N-of-1 trials using a stakeholder-engaged iterative design approach; and 2) determine the
preliminary effectiveness of an adapted N-of-1 protocol on patient decision confidence and deprescribing, and
3) determine the facilitators and barriers of implementing an adapted N-of-1 protocol into real-world clinical
practice by conducting a type-1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. I will achieve these aims by using ß-
blocker in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as a prototype for older adults with
multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This proposal will inform a future multicenter randomized controlled trial
focused on improving patient-reported outcomes, and provide a formative opportunity for me to obtain the
knowledge and skills necessary to become a leading researcher on patient-centered medication management."
10895304,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity and poor health behaviors are major modifiable contributors to health disparities in rural and Appalachian
populations. Residents in rural and Appalachian areas experience higher rates of obesity, cancer incidence, and
mortality, compared to residents in urban or non-Appalachian areas. Obesity increases the risk of 13 cancers
due to excessive adiposity accumulation and abnormal metabolic modifications. Weight loss, physical activity,
and healthy diet potentially attenuate the negative effects of obesity and reduce cancer risk and premature
mortality. Evidence-based weight loss programs have been implemented in clinical settings and showed various
health benefits. However, these programs solely focused on health-promoting resources available in urban areas
and are not generalizable to rural and Appalachian populations. Therefore, developing effective strategies to
provide weight loss programs for rural and Appalachian populations is an important priority. My long-term goal
is to reduce cancer risk and disparities through lifestyle modifications among rural and Appalachian populations.
To achieve this goal, the F99 phase focuses on understanding characteristics of rural and Appalachian
populations that influence health behaviors and obesity-related health outcomes (Aim 1a), identifying targetable
factors for intervention (Aim 1b), and translation of an evidence-based weight loss program to rural populations
(Aim 1c). To complete Aim 1a, we will utilize 2011-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. To
complete Aim 1b, we will conduct post-hoc mediation analysis using data from a completed NCI-sponsored
group-randomized weight loss trial in Appalachian adults. To complete Aim 1c, I will coordinate a 15-week
telephone-based pilot weight loss intervention among rural Ohio residents. This pilot study will translate an
evidence-based weight loss intervention with tailored strategies for rural populations to meet their needs. We will
determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among rural populations. The results from studies
in the F99 phase will guide the design of the intervention in the K00 phase: I will determine the dose-response
effect of a weight loss intervention on cancer risk factors in rural and Appalachian populations (Aim 2). To
complete this aim, I will design and conduct a pilot weight loss randomized controlled trial among
overweight/obese residents in rural and Appalachian areas. The proposed research aligns with an NCI strong
interest of behavioral intervention and cancer prevention across diverse populations. The proposed research
and training plan will: 1) provide the multidisciplinary training necessary to accelerate the translation of research
findings into the design and conduct of lifestyle interventions; 2) facilitate my long-term goal to become a
successful independent investigator with a focus on lifestyle modifications and cancer prevention in rural and
Appalachian populations; and 3) provide necessary experience to submit a competitive large-scale research
grant (R01)."
10864625,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) develops in more than 50% of youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as they transition
to young adulthood. Early identification of youth at risk of DKD, either due to environmental or biological factors,
has the potential to inform clinical care and alter the course of disease. Despite the substantial burden of DKD
in youth with T2D, however, modifiable risk factors and effective therapies remain limited. Emerging evidence
links per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of ubiquitous artificial chemicals used for more than
60 years in consumer and industrial products, with impaired kidney function, worse glucose regulation, and
higher levels of uremic toxins, key risk factors for DKD in youth with T2D. This study proposes to perform the
first prospective study to examine the association of PFAS exposure with DKD risk in youth with T2D and to
investigate potential biological mechanisms by integrating key information on metabolites and protein levels. The
project will build upon existing health and omics data (metabolomics and proteomics) in the Treatment Options
for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study, a longitudinal study of youth with T2D who
underwent annual measures of kidney function for an average of 10.2 years. Using archived plasma samples,
this project will measure levels of 10 common PFAS and up to 250 novel and emerging PFAS at baseline. Due
to the long biological half-lives of most of these chemicals, single PFAS measures are a good proxy for medium
to long-term PFAS exposures. Analyses will examine associations between individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures
with risk and progression of DKD using survival analysis and mixture methods. To examine the potential
biological pathways that link PFAS exposure with DKD, analyses will then examine associations of PFAS
(individual and mixtures) with metabolites and proteins potentially associated with DKD risk. Further, a novel
latent unknown clustering approach will be applied to comprehensively analyze PFAS exposure, multiomics, and
clinical data to identify subgroups of youth with T2D at high risk of DKD. These research findings will contribute
to the body of evidence needed to inform PFAS regulation and develop innovative environmental health
interventions to detect and prevent DKD in youth with T2D. The culmination of my scientific training has prepared
me to successfully carry out the proposed K01 research. Through a multifaceted training plan supported by a
strong transdisciplinary mentoring and advisory team, this K01 will provide the necessary support for me to
further develop as an independent environmental health researcher. In addition to the proposed research project,
a robust yet attainable training plan incorporating didactic instruction, seminars, conferences, and mentorship
will prepare me to successfully complete a future NIEHS R01 to examine personalized DKD prevention strategies
in young individuals, when potential lesions may still be reversible, to promote healthier lives in this at-risk
population."
10864699,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
For many years, scientists have been trying to find new therapeutic drugs. However, small molecules are still
imperfect tools for influencing human physiology. The chemical space that our known drugs occupy is extremely
small, representing a tiny sliver of the estimated 10^63 possible drug-like molecules. What’s more, the targets of
these drugs make up just about 3.5% of the roughly 20,000 proteins in the human proteome. This means almost
97% of the proteome is still untouched for drug intervention. These two factors suggest there’s immense potential
for discovering novel chemical structures to combat disease. However, systematically exploring such enormous
chemical spaces is physically unachievable. To synthesize even milligram scale representations of this chemical
space would result in a mass surpassing that of the known universe. This practical obstacle partly explains why
only a small portion of the proteins in the proteome have been pharmacologically targeted. To overcome this
diversity enumeration hurdle, we aim to introduce a completely new class of molecules capable of spontaneously
“shape shifting” at physiological temperature. This unique ability will allow them to assume a wide array of rapidly
interchanging structural isomers, essentially behaving like many molecules in one. We plan to demonstrate this
technology through the development of synthetic bullvalene amino acids that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing methodologies for combinatorial solid phase peptide synthesis to create shape shifting cyclic
peptides (SSCP). Our ultimate goal is to create a dynamic and adaptable library that far outpaces any known
library in terms of diversity. We aim to utilize this technology to identify single molecular entities that display multi-
target pharmacological properties."

10867871,"ABSTRACT: NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE
 The NP Core supports the Center’s overarching focus on Deep South disparities in dementia. Black or
African American (B/AA) individuals are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD), yet there is a lack of neuropathological data available to better comprehend the underlying
mechanisms of ADRD in this population. The UAB NP core is well-positioned to help address this unmet need.
The NP Core is the home for biospecimen banking and distribution for the ADRC, and thus coordinates both
the Center’s brain/tissue donation and fluid biomarker programs. The Center's Clinical Core cohort to date is
47% B/AA, with high rates of preconsent to brain donation. During the P20 phase, the NP core recruited a
board-certified neuropathologist, Dr. Rati Chkheidze, to lead the NP core and will continue to partner with a
senior leader of an established ADRC NP Core, Dr. William Seeley (UCSF), for oversight and mentoring with a
goal of full independence by the end of the funding cycle. We have developed processes for brain donation
preconsent, timely perimortem coordination of brain procurement, rigorous neuropathological diagnosis and
reporting, tissue storage, quality assessment, and distribution. We have launched a brain donation program,
collecting brains and other tissue from 18 cases across the state, conducting full neuropathological analysis
and diagnosis, banking fixed and frozen tissue, and completing and reporting NACC Neuropathology forms.
Collection of skin will facilitate innovative research on detection of multiprotein copathologies from an
accessible peripheral source. We have also built a growing collection of fluid biospecimens including CSF,
plasma, serum, PBMCs, buffy coats, DNA, RNA, and urine. We have established an early record of sharing by
distributing hundreds of aliquots from this biofluid repository. The NP Cores aims include providing accurate
neuropathological diagnosis on participants in the brain donation program, banking and distributing brain
tissue, skin tissue, and antemortem fluid biospecimens to investigators studying ADRD, educating clinicians
and investigators through a dynamic clinicopathologic conference program, and transitioning the UAB NP Core
to independent leadership by the end of the funding cycle."

The Molecular Biophysics Training Program (MBTP) at the Weill Cornell Graduate School (WCGS) is built on a
decades-long history of biophysics research and training at the two institutions comprising WCGS - Weill
Cornell Medicine (WCM) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) located across the street
from each other. MBTP will bring together biophysics trainees from two WCGS graduate bi-institutional
programs: the Biochemistry & Structural Biology (BSB) program, part of the umbrella Biochemistry, Cell and
Molecular Biology (BCMB) program and the Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology (PBSB) program.
Union of the biophysics trainees in these two programs is a natural fit given that biophysics is inherently
multidisciplinary – bringing together biology, chemistry, physics, computational biology, and mathematics.
MBTP will provide: 1) outstanding learning and mentoring for predoctoral trainees in molecular biophysics; 2)
world-class research opportunities; 3) a diverse and interactive community of students and faculty to foster
scientific exchange and collaboration; 4) strong foundation in performing rigorous and reproducible scientific
research and 5) knowledge of and exposure to various career paths for successful transition into the
biomedical research workforce. The formation of the MBTP program is the latest in a nearly three-decade
maturation of synergistic connections between WCM and MSKCC."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat and the only licensed TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guérin
(BCG), is inadequate: despite widespread use of BCG, there were 9.9 million new TB cases globally in 2020.
Thus, improved vaccines against Mtb are urgently needed. T cell responses remain the primary goal of TB
vaccines, as CD4 T cells are necessary to control Mtb in humans and animal models. T cell vaccines have been
thus far unsuccessful in preventing infection, but the recent clinical trial of M72-AS01E demonstrated ~50%
efficacy as a Prevention of Disease (POD) vaccine. Since TB is transmitted by those with active disease, which
is characterized by inflammation and immunopathology, a vaccine that reduces or prevents active disease and
immunopathology can have a large impact on the global problem of TB. However, the most optimal antigen
target(s) for TB vaccines are not defined, and the lack of evolutionary variation in the known antigens of Mtb
suggests that T cell recognition of those antigens is not detrimental to the pathogen or beneficial to the host.
Through a comprehensive analysis of genomes from 216 phylogenetically diverse Mtb, my advisor and his
colleagues discovered a distinct subset of Mtb antigens that are sequence variable and exhibit evidence of
evolutionary selection pressure. In a screen of DNA vaccines encoding these sequence variable antigens, I
discovered one (encoding 4 sequence variable antigens) that alters immunopathology and inflammatory Th1
responses in mice subsequently challenged with Mtb, without reducing lung bacterial burdens. Additional studies
in our laboratory have demonstrated distinct CD4 T cell effector responses to these same antigens in humans.
From these and other results, we hypothesize that a functionally distinct T cell response to one or more of our
vaccine antigens is responsible for altered immunopathology in vaccinated mice after challenge. The objective
of this proposal is to characterize the cellular responses in vaccinated mice after challenge and identify the
mechanism that accounts for altered immunopathology. I will characterize the cellular response using spectral
flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. I will then characterize the vaccine-specific T cell response
using peptide:MHC tetramers and single cell RNA sequencing to identify potential mechanisms mediating the
altered immunopathology response. Finally, I will identify the underlying mechanism(s) by performing adoptive
transfers of sorted T cells to identify the phenotype of the T cells that alter immunopathology during infection.
This work will identify differential T cell responses to distinct Mtb antigens and demonstrate a role of
immunoregulation in mediating a vaccine response to Mtb infection. The findings will provide an understanding
of T cell responses to Mtb antigens that can modulate immunopathology. This will provide a framework of
vaccine-induced immunoregulatory responses to inform development of POD vaccines for Mtb."

 Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial-derived gastroenteritis in the world. Human
infection often occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food, especially poultry, which leads to the
bacterium colonizing the colon and causing severe inflammation and diarrhea. While infection and disease is
often self-limiting, persistent colonization and chronic diseases do occur. Despite the significant impacts of C.
jejuni on human health, very little is known about the interactions that occur at the host-pathogen interface during
infection, including how C. jejuni senses and adapts to the host intestinal environment to promote infection. This
is primarily due to the evolutionary divergence of this organism from other gastrointestinal pathogens, which
limits the relevance of findings from those organisms and necessitates specific study of the Campylobacter
genus. To that end, our group previously identified a unique regulator in C. jejuni, which we call HeuR, that
promotes maximum colonization of a natural avian host and was subsequently found to positively or negatively
regulate several genetic determinants, including those involved in the acquisition of iron from host heme and the
biosynthesis of methionine. In addition, HeuR and its downstream targets are required for efficient invasion or
persistence in human colonocytes, which suggests these mechanisms need to be better understood as they are
clearly involved in infection of animals.
 We preliminarily determined that this novel regulator binds several TCA intermediates and may sense
TCA cycle activity to control expression of colonization determinants. First, we will define all direct targets of
HeuR and examine whether TCA intermediates impact the ability of HeuR to bind those DNA targets and impact
gene expression. Additionally, we will identify the ligand binding motif of this novel regulator and how it facilitates
HeuR activity. Second, because we have determined that C. jejuni TCA intermediate abundance is affected by
iron-restriction, we will use mass isotopomer analysis to identify the points along the C. jejuni TCA cycle that are
affected by iron-limitation and determine whether altering TCA cycle activity affects HeuR-dependent
colonization determinant expression. In addition, we will directly determine the levels at which each TCA enzyme
indicated by mass isotopomer analysis is affected by iron-limitation. Lastly, one of the direct targets of HeuR we
identified that may be impacted by TCA intermediate-dependent binding is the heme utilization system of C.
jejuni. This system is poorly characterized in C. jejuni and we will examine whether this system facilitates iron
acquisition during animal infection and will work to fully characterize the process of heme utilization so that it can
be leveraged in future studies to inhibit the infection potential of C. jejuni."

Cancer proteogenomics encompasses methods that integrate mass spectrometry (MS)-based measurements
of protein abundance and post-translational modifications (PTMs) with genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic
data from preclinical cancer models and tumor samples. The multidisciplinary Proteogenomic Characterization
Center we propose will employ a range of state-of-the-art MS-based proteomic and metabolomic technologies
to systematically generate and integrate high quality, comprehensive and quantitative proteomic and
metabolomic data with genomic data. Our overarching goals are to leverage the integrated data to identify
signatures of cancer drivers, detect signaling network adaptations and provide information on PTMs that affect
cellular signaling, molecular complex formation, and protein location, translation and stability in human
biospecimens and relevant models of cancer. Peptidomes of the class I and II human leukocyte antigens (HLA)
of the tumors will also be analyzed to shed light on tumor-immune escape mechanisms and antigen processing
in cancer, improve algorithms for prediction of antigen display and immunogenicity and inform development of
personalized cancer vaccines. We hypothesize that integrating deep, high quality, quantitative proteomic and,
especially, PTM-omic, HLA-peptidomic and metabolomic data with genomic and transcriptomic data will provide
novel insights into the pathophysiology of cancer and help to identify new, actionable targets for drug
development and treatment. Data will be rapidly distributed to the cancer biology and clinical communities, as
we have done for the past 15 years in the NCI-CPTAC program. The resulting datasets will enable a broad range
of investigation by many teams, accelerating molecularly-oriented cancer research toward biological and clinical
impact. We will also systematically develop and apply high sensitivity targeted MS assays to peptide/protein
targets identified in the Discovery Arm, with an emphasis on posttranslationally-modified peptides in signaling
cascades, oncogenic pathway regulators and effectors, and druggable proteins. Assays will use stable isotope-
labeled standards for unambiguous identification and quantification and follow Tier 2 guidelines developed from
the community-based effort led by the Broad proteomics team. Existing technologies will be further developed
and automated to enable comprehensive analysis of rare tumor cell populations, to evaluate tumor
heterogeneity, to increase depth and breadth of post-translational modification analysis, and to improve depth,
reliability and repeatability of peptide identification and quantification in general by intelligent data acquisition."

10882760,"Project Summary
Low-value care (LVC), defined as care where harms or costs outweigh the benefits, is common and costly. For
patients, LVC can result in physical harm from the service itself, unnecessary follow-up tests/procedures, and
needless out-of-pocket costs. Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk of receiving LVC:
studies estimate that up to 50% of tests and 15% of procedures performed on patients with CAD may be LVC.
To identify and reduce LVC, accurate measurement is critical. Despite widespread adoption of administrative
claims-based measures to assess LVC, most measures have not been tested against the “gold standard” of
chart review (i.e., they do not have good criterion validity). Using inaccurate LVC measures undermines quality
reporting and leads to inaccuracies in understanding the frequency, costs, and trends in use of LVC services; a
critical knowledge gap in understanding which LVC services should be prioritized for reduction.
Bundled payment models (BPMs), which pay organizations a fixed price for a 90-day episode of care such as
elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), could reduce LVC but could also have unintended
consequences. Because BPMs provide a fixed payment to providers independent of patient risk, BPM
providers might perform more PCIs on low-risk patients for whom medical therapy alone is the guideline-
recommended treatment (i.e., they may perform more LVC PCIs). BPM providers might also perform fewer
appropriate PCIs for high-risk patients, or those perceived to be high-risk such as racial/ethnic minorities. To
assess the impacts of the elective PCI BPM, we will use data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry,
which contains a reliable measure to classify PCIs as LVC or appropriate using clinical chart review data.
We have assembled an experienced team of cardiologists, economists, and outcomes researchers. In prior
and pilot work we have validated 3 claims-based LVC measures, but also found that 1 measure was not valid.
In Aim 1, we will use chart review as a “gold-standard” to assess the validity of commonly-used claims-based
LVC measures relevant for CAD patients. In Aim 2, we will use validated LVC measures to assess LVC
frequency, costs, and trends among a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries with CAD, and provide
policymakers with a priority list of LVC services to target for reduction. In Aim 3, we will conduct a difference-in-
differences analysis to assess the impact of elective PCI BPMs on a) LVC PCIs and healthcare disparities for
appropriate PCIs using detailed clinical data from the NCDR, and b) other validated LVC services using linked
Medicare claims. For patients with CAD, this research will 1) establish valid LVC measures which are needed
for quality improvement and accountability programs, 2) guide efforts to reduce LVC services, and 3) evaluate
the effect (and potential unintended consequences) of a policy intended to reduce LVC."
10914312,"Project Summary
This proposal's objective is to develop synchrotron-based X-ray imaging technologies to enable high-resolution imaging
of brain-wide neuronal circuits. Comprehensively mapping brain-wide circuits is not currently feasible, even in small
mammalian model systems, because light microscopy (LM) lacks sufficient resolution and electron microscopy (EM)
cannot be applied over large volumes. Leveraging the unprecedented qualities of the new 4th generation synchrotron
source at the European Synchrotron, we will develop X-ray nano-holography (XNH) imaging techniques for large-scale
imaging of brain circuits. Taking advantage of improvements in source coherence and brightness, we will improve
imaging resolution to allow direct visualization of synaptic connections between neurons, and develop imaging protocols
that allow imaging of centimeter-scale circuit volumes within a typical beamline experiment. We will combine non-
destructive XNH with EM and LM imaging techniques to rigorously and quantitatively validate the accuracy of XNH-
based circuit reconstruction. We will then use this correlative workflow to study the relationships between long-range
sensory inputs, local synaptic micro-circuitry, and single-neuron activity, investigating how circuits in the posterior
parietal cortex (PPC) support perceptual decision-making. Lastly, we will apply XNH circuit-mapping over an entire
cortical hemisphere, and utilize deep-learning based machine vision algorithms to obtain a comprehensive atlas of cortical
connectivity. This atlas will in principle resolve all long-range connections between cortical areas at single-axon
resolution, lending insight into how distinct cortical areas achieve specialized function, and how distributed cortical
networks support cognition and are affected by psychiatric disorders."

10877698,"ABSTRACT (SWINE CORE)
The Swine Core of the Indiana Diabetes Research Center is a Regional/National Shared Resource Core that
has been operating and servicing researchers since 2004. The central function of the Swine Core is to reduce
barriers to the use of Ossabaw swine, a unique animal model that closely approximates human metabolic
syndrome (MetS) and progression to type 2 diabetes, with attendant long-term complications. Understanding
and therapeutic treatment of MetS and diabetes with numerous long-term health complications in humans has
been stifled by the lack of translational animal models. Experimental methods and translation to human clinical
medicine is not possible from widely used rodent and transgenic mouse models. The Swine Core will
characterize MetS and progression to type 2 diabetes and/or chemically-induced diabetes (MetS/D) and the
resulting comorbidities in Ossabaw swine. We have provided Ossabaw tissue and/or live pigs to ~160
investigators during the 15 years of the Swine Core operation. A bank of ~50 different tissues available from
each pig has enabled widespread dissemination to other investigators, providing outstanding resource sharing
and cost-effectiveness. Providing this swine resource enables testing of numerous hypotheses about the
integrated, in vivo pathogenesis and long-term complications and provides tissues for studies of cellular and
molecular mechanisms. The Swine Core is a critical interface in the translation of research from simpler animal
models (Islet & Physiology Core) to humans (Translation Core). The Swine Core is Directed by Dr. M. Sturek,
a leader in modeling human diseases in swine, and Dr. M. Alloosh serves as the Associate Director. The
Specific Aims of the Swine Core are to:
 (1). Make lean and diet-induced MetS and diabetic (MetS/D) pigs readily available, i.e. “on the shelf”.
 (2). Determine the endocrine, metabolic, and dyslipidemia indices of MetS/D to screen for optimal
phenotypes.
 (3). Provide a tissue and data bank for distribution.
These aims of the Swine Core will reduce barriers to study of this highly relevant animal model, and will
facilitate the progressive translation of research from simpler, less complex models to humans."

 (1) To solicit, review, and fund P&F grants. These grants will be provided to outstanding beginning and
established investigators at IUSM and its affiliated institutions whose expertise is complimentary to areas of
strength within the IDRC membership, whose research has a high probability of benefiting from use of the
IDRC core facilities, and for whom such funding may result in acquisition of major peer-reviewed grants.
 (2) To provide mentorship/support for recipients of P&F grants. The goal of these relationships will be to
provide a source of intellectual support and critique during the project period to facilitate the application of the

10877757,"Project 1 Summary
The long-running Strong Heart Study documented high urinary arsenic (As) and uranium (U) levels in Native
American tribal study sites relative to the general US population. Elevated exposures to metals and metalloids
(hereafter metals) potentially contribute to the epidemic of cardiometabolic disease affecting tribal and other rural
communities in the US. In rural communities of the Northern Plains, drinking water is commonly derived from
unregulated and largely unmonitored private wells or public water systems that draw from the same aquifers.
Much of the As and U exposure likely results from elevated levels of metals in groundwater sources. However,
groundwater data are relatively scarce for rural communities, especially from tribal regions, making it difficult to
identify groundwater hazards, and to mitigate their exposures. Project 1 of the Columbia University Northern
Plains Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP) uses a two-pronged approach to address a critical gap in our
understanding of the distribution of groundwater contamination and exposure across rural areas including Native
American tribal areas. First, we will integrate existing and new measurements of groundwater composition data
with prior large mineralogical and chemical speciation data sets. Second, we will use a combination of
groundwater composition in wells and remotely sensed hydrological and other variables to develop machine
learning-based predictive models of groundwater contaminant levels at the household scale—the foundational
data needed for exposure assessment. We have 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will analyze drinking water sources from
the CUNP-SRP field areas to identify and better understand the mobilization mechanisms of As and U into
drinking water. Aim 2 will develop process-based models that predict As and U drinking water concentrations at
the household scale across the Northern Plains. Aim 3 will develop and validate As and U drinking water
exposure profiles for the Strong Heart Arsenic and Uranium Lifelong (SHAUL) cohort (for Project 3) by comparing
spatial and temporal variability and trends in water metal concentrations, water use, and detailed residential
histories with urinary-based exposures for tribal participants from all SHAUL locations. We will also evaluate the
impact of policy interventions on drinking water As and U exposures, including those from changes in water
sources and use, implementation of As MCL on contaminant concentrations in CWSs, and implementation of
point-of-use filtration. Combined, our data and models will provide improved understanding of environmental
exposures that is needed for the CUNP-SRP to contextualize the health effects of hazardous metal mixtures
(Projects 3 and 4), to identify mitigation pathways to clean water (Project 5), and to allow the Community
Engagement and Administrative Cores to make the environmental data and their interpretations accessible to
these tribal communities. Ultimately, the results of these efforts in data collection, modeling, and additional data
analysis will help identify at-risk populations and develop effective interventions to reduce potentially dangerous
exposures to contaminated drinking water in the Northern Plains and beyond."
10877759,"Project 2 Summary
Native American communities surveyed in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) show markedly higher arsenic (As),
uranium (U) and selenium (Se) concentrations in urine relative to the average US population. Much of the
exposure to hazardous metal mixtures comes from drinking groundwater contaminated with metals often above
safety standards. Tribal lands in the US often coincide with mineral deposits, U mining, and metal(loid)
contamination in aquifers. In the Northern Plains, elevated concentrations of U and As in drinking water reflect
naturally occurring enrichment in aquifers, as well as the legacy of mining near tribal communities. Project 2 of
the Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP) will use isotopic
compositions of U and Se, as these elements are sensitive to redox changes in the aquifer, to infer sources and
processes controlling contaminant exposures. Redox chemistry of U and Se controls their aqueous
concentrations in groundwater; the oxidized species are mobile and toxic whereas the reduced species are
insoluble. Concentrations of dissolved U and Se are affected by multiple processes (e.g., dilution, adsorption,
dispersion) and are poor indicators of redox-induced fate and cycling in groundwater. Thus, isotope ratios of
dissolved U and Se in groundwater, in tandem with concentrations, are invaluable for studying redox-induced
(im)mobilization, and tracing uptake and human exposure. We will use U and Se isotope ratios to characterize
redox reactions in groundwater, acquiring unique mechanistic information about the reaction progress. These
data will help us define local and more distal sources, and the transport and cycling processes of metals in
groundwater within the SHS communities in North/South Dakota. Furthermore, we will develop isotopic tracers
of U and Se cycling in humans impacted by environmental exposures. The specific aims are to: (1) Determine
spatial distribution pattern of isotope ratios or “isoscapes” of U and Se in groundwater samples. This will use
high-resolution data and models from Project 1 to target wells within and around U, As and Se hotspots for
isotopic characterization. We will also identify local versus distal sources of contamination around these hotspots.
(2) Determine the levels of naturally occurring reductive U and Se removal from groundwater and identify
conditions for potential As release based on the temporal evolution of U and Se isotope ratios. We will
characterize the redox transformation of U and Se and potential mixing of multiple groundwater sources (if any).
(3) Determine human exposure from the environmental contamination using isotopic tracers. We will develop a
novel non-invasive method to track metal exposure from U and Se in drinking water. For this, we will measure U
and Se isotope ratios in urine to constrain primary exposure sources and affected populations by linking those
to water isoscapes and the observational data from Project 3. Our results will help evaluate risk of exposure to
hazardous metal mixtures, monitoring and management of contaminated aquifers, and linking exposures to
environmental sources using a non-invasive diagnostic tool."
10877760,"Summary of Project 3
Native American populations have higher rates of cardiometabolic disease, including cardiovascular disease
(CVD) and diabetes, than any other racial/ethnic group in the US. In the Strong Heart Study (SHS), the most
important study of CVD and its risk factors in Native American communities, we showed that long-term arsenic
(As) exposure can explain part of the excess burden of cardiometabolic disease. Uranium (U) exposure is
associated with CVD in occupational cohorts, but data from general populations are limited. Importantly, As and
U are common contaminants in Superfund sites and tribal lands, so exposure to these contaminants could be
partially responsible for increased rates of cardiometabolic disease in Native American populations. Advancing
effective interventions for metal-related cardiometabolic diseases requires robust data on the lasting effects of
past exposures, the joint effects of As and U, and the relevant mechanisms, including downstream molecular
effects. To address these needs, we will establish the Strong Heart As/U Lifelong (SHAUL) study (n=1,300) by
linking data from participants at SHS visit 1 (1989–91) with their offspring recruited during the SHS family
expansion in 2001–03 (visit 4). We will leverage 30 years of data and a new visit planned for 2022–23 to address
the following aims. (1) Determine the cardiometabolic effects (diabetes and CVD) of childhood and adult
As and U exposures overall and by sex, region, and nutritional status. Urinary metal biomarkers are available
at visits 1 (reflecting childhood exposure) and 4 (reflecting adult exposure), and will be measured at visits 5
(2006–09) and 7 (2022–23) to reconstruct lifelong exposures. Water metal data, including spatial patterns,
temporal trends, and stable isotope data tracing potential sources, will be available from Projects 1 and 2. (2)
Determine the longitudinal epigenetic and metabolomic effects of childhood and adult As and U
exposures overall and by sex, region, and nutritional status. We will measure genome-wide DNA methylation
(DNAm) at visits 4 and 5, leverage extant targeted and untargeted metabolomics from the same visits, and use
a joint DNAm/metabolomic multi-omics strategy. (3) Develop a predictive multi-omics fingerprint that
quantifies latent and concurrent cardiometabolic risk due to As and U exposures. We will use machine
learning approaches to characterize DNAm and metabolomic profiles that identify individuals at risk of diabetes
or CVD due to past or current metal exposures. We will also conduct a cross-species multi-omics comparison
with Project 4’s mouse data. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metal exposures are major concerns for our
partnering communities in the Northern Plains. By investigating the latent and concurrent effects of As and U
exposures, the SHAUL study can reveal epigenetic and metabolomic mechanisms for metal-induced health
effects, identify susceptible populations, and inform risk assessment. The findings will have direct implications
for the prevention and control of water contaminants and cardiometabolic diseases in affected communities,
including in the Northern Plains, near Superfund sites, and near other contaminated areas in the US and globally."
10877761,"Project 4 Summary
Chronic exposure to metals and metalloids (hereafter metals) is detrimental to human cardiovascular and
metabolic health. Native Americans living in the Northern Plains consume well water with elevated levels of
arsenic (As) and uranium (U), common Superfund site contaminants. Metal exposures in these populations are
epidemiologically linked to high rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, strategies to prevent or
treat the disease burdens related to groundwater metal exposures have been limited by poor understanding of
the molecular mechanisms of individual and combined metal exposures. To fill this gap, Project 4 of the Columbia
University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP) will establish human-relevant mouse
models of chronic metal exposures and cardiometabolic disease to comprehensively evaluate such mechanisms.
We will leverage genetically engineered mouse models to investigate developmental vulnerability, tissue and
cellular level effects, and specific molecular mediators of exposure–outcome relationships. We will expose mice
to environmentally relevant concentrations of As and/or U in addition to well water samples containing a naturally
elevated As/U mixture that people in the Northern Plains consume (collected in Project 1). We will then determine
the cardiometabolic effects of these exposures, compare early-life to lifelong exposures, and determine how
dietary folate mitigates As toxicity. Aim 1 will define health impacts and developmental vulnerability of
early-life or lifelong exposure to As/U in drinking water in genetically engineered mice. Mouse
cardiometabolic health will be evaluated longitudinally with a battery of clinical, histological, behavioral, and
functional tests with a focus on atherosclerosis, hypertension, adiposity and diabetes, in the context of a
hyperlipidemic model. Moreover, this aim will generate a biobank of As and/or U exposed animal tissues for
future studies, creating an expansive resource for collaborative research projects with other SRP centers. Aim
2 will profile mouse multi-omics biomarkers altered by early-life or lifelong exposure to As/U in drinking
water. DNA methylation, gene expression, and the metabolome will be profiled in mouse blood, liver, and
pancreas samples collected in Aim 1 to reveal molecular markers of metal exposure and cardiometabolic
disease. Molecular signatures in mice will be compared to Project 3 human molecular signatures to identify
conserved pathogenic mechanisms as well as the utility of blood biospecimen markers to represent target organ
pathologies not typically available in human observational research. Aim 3 will evaluate the human-relevant
potential for and mechanisms of dietary folate supplementation to reduce As toxicity. Since laboratory
mice rapidly eliminate consumed As via methylation, we will use mice that instead metabolize As similarly to
humans. Through these three aims, we will establish a valid animal model system for causal discovery science
and to test therapeutic interventions to tackle the extensive and disproportionate disease burden attributable to
groundwater metal exposures affecting tribal populations in the Northern Plains."
10877762,"Project 5 Summary
The Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP) seeks to reduce exposure
to arsenic (As) and uranium (U), frequently found in excess of safe limits on tribal lands in North and South
Dakota and elsewhere. In these areas, drinking water is primarily derived from groundwater. This reliance often
results in people using untreated or insufficiently treated water from private wells that is unfit for consumption.
Community water systems (CWSs) also use groundwater and often fail to limit As and U contamination to safe
levels despite treatment. Inadequate removal of As and U by conventional water treatment stems from the limited
adsorption of their most abundant forms in groundwater, As(III) and U(VI), and due to the limited sorption capacity
of media. Importantly, these As and U exposures are associated with cardiometabolic disease, which exerts a
disproportionately high burden in Native American populations. The overall goal of Project 5 is to decrease
exposure using novel point-of-use filtration and point-of-entry treatment systems that use light to create media
and enhance As and U sorption by simultaneously oxidizing As and reducing U. Our technology is based on an
efficient, photosynthetic microbial battery that generates reactive treatment media by cycling iron (Fe), which is
ideal to remove chemical contamination from groundwater. This approach takes advantage of the aqueous
composition of input water and microbial communities, which often contain reduced forms of Fe(II) and
manganese (Mn(II)) and/or nitrate, in addition to metal(loid) contaminants. Specific aims will address the
underlying processes to optimize this novel water treatment technology and the necessary monitoring needed
to ensure system performance. In Aim 1, media will be generated by harnessing natural microbial populations
from groundwater that are powered by light and the chemical energy stored within water to create Fe oxide
media. In Aim 2, enhanced treatment will be obtained through heterogeneous photocatalysis that selectively and
simultaneously can reduce and oxidize groundwater contaminants to less soluble forms. In Aim 3, we will develop
and integrate a real-time, water quality monitor in the treatment system to ensure that the system performs to
specifications and to be able to alert the user and/or water treatment company before the system fails. Each aim
targets development of a commercially viable product. This project remediates As and U in groundwater,
common contaminants at Superfund sites and some of the most widespread contaminants in the US, especially
in rural communities. These remediation approaches will be tested and implemented in the Northern Plains in
areas with As and/or U affected drinking water. Implementation will allow us to pilot the use of this novel treatment
method under a wide range of water compositions and with typical use patterns. Ultimately, the novel water
remediation technologies developed in this project are expected to provide a feasible and effective means to
reduce potentially harmful exposures to drinking water contamination in our target communities and other at-risk
populations, including communities near Superfund and other hazardous sites."
10877763,"Administrative Core - Summary
The Administrative (Admin) Core serves as the central resource of the Columbia University Northern Plains
Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP). CUNP-SRP is a new center that will establish a partnership
between scientists and tribal communities to advance science and technology to address hazardous chemicals
in drinking water and their related health effects in the Northern Plains. It will be led by Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, a
physician-scientist and environmental epidemiologist who has been working with tribal communities for more
than a decade, and Dr. Steven Chillrud, an environmental geochemist with longstanding experience in exposure
sciences, remediation of Superfund sites, and research translation. Our Tribal Communication Specialist will be
Rae O’Leary, a public health expert centrally located at the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in the Northern Plains
with experience in policy development working with tribal leadership. The CUNP-SRP Admin Core’s main
objective is to facilitate the interaction and success of each Project and Core and to maximize the impact of all
its activities, including translation and communication with our tribal partners in the Northern Plains, in
collaboration with the Community Engagement Core. The Admin Core will support research translation of CUNP-
SRP activities by: a) partnering with tribal and governmental agencies to promote and facilitate water testing,
connect houses on wells to community water systems, and educate communities on legislative options;
b) coordinating technology transfer including local commercialization of research designs developed by CUNP-
SRP investigators; c) communicating within SRP and to NIEHS SRP staff results of those translation activities
as well as findings from Projects/Cores; d) fostering and reporting investigator-initiated research translation; and
e) providing information dissemination to other end-users. The specific aims are as follows: (1) Foster
interdisciplinary collaboration through collective leadership and strategic vision and coordination of seminars/
webinars, meetings (including the monthly steering committee meeting and the monthly research seminar),
annual progress reports, evaluations, and other activities; (2) Enable multidirectional research translation
among investigators, NIEHS, other SRPs, tribal, state, and federal government agencies, other organizations,
community partners, and the broader public; and (3) Facilitate career development of early-stage scientists,
including Native American investigators, through mentoring and networking activities and the support of
applications in response to program announcements, awards, and diversity supplements. Overall, the Admin
Core will promote integration of Projects and Cores to inform the CUNP-SRP on the best methods and strategies
to reduce hazardous water contaminants (with a focus on metals), facilitate remediation in contaminated
Superfund sites and tribal lands, and mitigate the health effects of water contamination long-term."
10877764,"DMAC Summary
The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will ensure wide accessibility of the complex and integrated
health and earth science data generated within the Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research
Program (CUNP-SRP). These efforts will be guided by an overarching mission to treat and share data
according to the principles of tribal data sovereignty and the research code set in place by our partnering
communities in the Northern Plains. The DMAC will dedicate significant resources to supporting application of
existing analysis methods, developing innovative analysis techniques, and ensuring long-term reproducibility of
results by leveraging statistical and data science expertise. The DMAC is centrally positioned in the CUNP-SRP
and will serve all Projects and Cores, including the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and Research
Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC), through three aims. Aim 1 will integrate and enhance
data management, sharing, and interoperability. We will use established capabilities of the Data Management
Unit at Columbia University to develop customized data management and quality assurance plans for each
Project/Core, manage data collection and databases, coordinate and harmonize datasets, and provide for their
efficient querying. The DMAC will create streamlined data communication across Projects and with external
partners and data requestors, following appropriate procedures approved by our partnering tribal communities,
by creating an integrated webpage that provides central access to the databases and offers advanced search
capabilities. The webpage will act as a platform to locate, access, and mine data while meeting the data sharing
requirements of each study. We will also share data via this Database Directory and will work with investigators,
data owners, and governmental or policymaking agencies to locate additional available online data resources.
Aim 2 will expand statistical resources, data analysis capability, and reproducibility tools. DMAC will
provide expertise in established methods for data analysis including statistical and physical modeling. It will also
support development of innovative methods, particularly in complex and high-dimensional data inherent to omics
research and to complex environmental and geospatial research. Additionally, DMAC will develop, test, and
apply robust implementations of new methods for complex data and ensure long-term reproducibility of findings
through containerized analysis pipelines. Aim 3 will educate investigators, trainees, and citizen scientists
in data sovereignty, sharing, management and analysis. DMAC will collaborate with the RETCC to organize
workshops, seminars, and other educational opportunities. Methods, results, and educational resources will be
shared with all stakeholders via CUNP-SRP outreach through the CEC, Admin Core, and including the DMAC
webpage. Procedures established by DMAC will strive to meet the needs of all investigators and partnering
communities, adding substantial value to our collaborations within the CUNP-SRP, across other SRP centers,
and to the wider community."
10881196,"Abstract
 Neuroimaging of infants and young children is increasingly used to monitor brain development that can
ultimately influence long-term health and behavioral outcomes. Our research team is one of four centers
participating in the Outcomes of Babies with Opioid Exposure (OBOE) study, a national effort to assess the
effects of antenatal opioid exposure on baby development. These babies have neonatal opioid withdrawal
symptoms at birth and struggle to maintain sleep or stillness during the MR scan. This patient population, and
other pediatric patients in general, stress significant unmet needs for motion robust and quantitative imaging
techniques for baby developmental assessment. However, there are unique challenges to imaging non-sedated
babies using MRI, including high failure rate (no usable MRI data) due to motion, lack of quantitative and sensitive
image markers for developmental assessment, and lack of imaging analysis tools specific for fast-evolving baby
brains. In this proposal, we have established a multi-PI team, including MR Fingerprinting imaging developers
(CWRU), baby imaging analysis and AI experts (UNC) and high-risk neonate clinical experts (UH) to address
the unmet needs for baby imaging, and use the imaging tools to assess developmental delays of the opioid-
exposed babies. We will achieve our goal with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop a motion-robust and
comprehensive MRF scan to provide multiple quantitative tissue property maps for non-sedated babies; Aim 2:
Develop baby-centric image processing tools and derive quantitative image features to characterize whole brain
tissue changes; and Aim 3: Quantitatively assess developmental changes in opioid-exposed babies and predict
the risk of developmental delays. This project will provide an imaging tool to relate quantitative features in brain
structure and development to neurologic functions, opening the opportunity for early targeted interventions aimed
at improving outcomes. The high quality, fast and motion robust MRF scans will have a broad impact for pediatric
patients on improving scan success rate and reducing the sedation rate. The quantitative and comprehensive
MRF scans will also have great potentials in assessing longitudinal changes regarding development alternations
and therapeutic response."
10881245,"Abstract: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a rare group of heterogeneous
autoimmune diseases targeting the peripheral nervous system, affects 10 in 100,000 individuals in the USA.
Patients with CIDP usually present with symmetric proximal and/or distal muscle weakness, sensory symptoms,
and may have a significant physical and socioeconomic burden. CIDP is considered responsive to
glucocorticoids, intravenous/subcutaneous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis; however, only 11% of patients
with CIDP achieve stable disease control without therapy, and 51% require continuous therapy. Sural nerve
biopsies in CIDP showed immunoglobulin and complement deposition on Schwann cells and compact myelin.
CIDP patients’ sera bind to nerves, and passive transfer of serum to animal models can cause demyelination
and slowing of nerve conduction velocity. While humoral mechanisms are critical to CIDP pathogenesis, many
aspects of disease pathomechanism remain unknown. In the majority of patients with CIDP, a definitive
autoantibody is not identified. Only recently, autoantibodies against nodal proteins, neurofascin 186 (NF186) and
gliomedin, and the paranodal proteins neurofascin 155 and contactin 1 were found to be pathogenic in a subclass
of CIDP, classified as autoimmune nodopathies (AIN). These autoantibodies in AIN are predominantly of IgG4
subtypes. AIN has distinct clinical phenotypes and responds better to B cell depletion therapy. The drivers of
these predominantly IgG4 autoantibodies and their pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. This study will
address some key aspects of disease pathomechanism in CIDP and AIN. We will identify the phenotypes of the
B and T cell subsets that drive the immunopathology of CIDP and AIN. We will identify, isolate, and authenticate
highly specific autoantibody-producing B cells and comprehensively define their respective phenotypes at the
single-cell level by simultaneously profiling gene expression and full-length paired B-cell receptors. T follicular
helper cells have been implicated in other IgG4-mediated diseases, and we will investigate their role in IgG4-
mediated AIN. We will develop human monoclonal nodal/paranodal antibodies to define the antibody-mediated
pathomechanism by examining the requirement of monovalent autoantibody binding and the role of somatic
hypermutation in antibody affinity. We will also examine antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and
phagocytosis. We will investigate the role of CD4+ T cells in selecting these specific autoantibody secreting B
cells. Lastly, we will use high-throughput state-of-the-art antigen discovery platforms to identify new antigen
targets in CIDP and validate the positive targets through well-established assays. Recently, new therapies have
become available for neuromuscular diseases targeting complement activation, neonatal Fc receptor inhibitors,
and B cell depletion, but treatment response to such therapies will depend on the underlying immunopathology.
This study will identify the underlying pathomechanism, help make a more informed decision regarding
therapeutic management, and improve patient care in CIDP and AIN."
10882403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human brain has an expanded cortex compared to its closest relatives, and this outer layer of the brain
provides humans with complex functions including integration of sensory inputs, judgement, and conscious
decision making. Each of these areas of the cortex contains unique cell types, density of cells across layers,
transcriptional identities, and connectivity patterns that emerge during developmental timepoints. Importantly,
virtually all neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders develop with cortical area specific phenotypes,
and often with specific laminar manifestations as well. The vulnerabilities to these disorders are established
during these developmental timepoints. While the existence of early morphogenetic gradients is known to
establish the poles of the cortical areas, and “inside-out” neurogenesis lays the foundations for the six layers of
the cortical plate, open questions regarding the transcriptional regulators of these terminal fates remains partially
unknown in the developing human brain. Recent efforts through the BRAIN Initiative and others have generated
expansive single-cell characterizations of the developing human cortex, providing an opportunity to mine these
datasets in order to identify novel regulators of these cell fate specification events. Additionally, previous work
characterizing the developing human brain has generated an “atlas of arealization” that identifies the genes that
are expressed in each cortical area across developmental time. This dataset serves as a hypothesis generating
tool for the identification of specific mechanisms of cortical arealization. Cortical organoids are three-dimensional
models of the developing human brain that enable genetic access to and mechanistic interrogation of the
developing human brain. These models have revolutionized our ability to model and characterize human
development and neurodevelopmental disease, but recent characterizations of the system have identified that
these organoids are not cortical area specific, but can be used for the exploration of terminal specification factors.
Understanding the detailed mechanisms of cortical arealization and laminar specification could enable not only
more specific understanding of disease etiology, but could also improve organoid models for the study of normal
development and disease. Thus, this proposal will evaluate the signals that drive cortical arealization and laminar
identity using both a bioinformatic and CRISPR activation screen. Additional efforts will explore the timing and
permanence of these specification factors via knockdown of candidate regulators; proof of the pipeline will be
executed with the factors identified in our preliminary studies related to the specification of FEZF2 deep layer
neurons. Together, these studies will establish mechanisms and models of arealization and laminar identity in
the developing human brain."

With the advent of small, highly stable miniproteins and the ability to generate easily more, methods and
prototypes for their applications both computationally as well as experimentally are needed.
As part 1, we will investigate the potential of miniprotein-based fusion inhibitors. We will target multiple class I
fusion proteins and evaluate their potential as treatment using two animal models. Many pathogenic viruses,
including influenza, Ebola, coronaviruses and the Pneumoviridae, rely on class I fusion proteins to fuse the viral
and cellular membranes. Their fusion proteins change from the metastable pre- to the more energetically
favorable post-fusion state which is thought to drive membrane merging. The postfusion structure gives insight
into how a potential intermediate state can be inhibited. We propose the development of a platform that takes
advantage of this phenomenon and extracts information from the post-fusion state structure to develop fusion
inhibitors. We are targeting CoV-2, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Nipah virus and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS). We have generated several candidates against CoV-2 and RSV. We will evaluate their
neutralization potential first in cell culture and then analyze the most potent version in animals. We will explore
treatment window, dosage, and delivery methods, linkage to co-localizers and their immunogenicity. We have
established a proof-of-concept illustrating that we can computationally design inhibitors, verify, and optimize
these binding using yeast surface display: preliminary data demonstrates, an inhibitor generated with this
pipeline neutralizes the live CoV-2 virus in cell culture. We believe the proposed framework will be applicable for
more class I fusion viruses and provide a general protocol for the development or optimization of new biologics
based on miniproteins. Furthermore, our platform will provide technology for pandemic preparedness.
Second, we are proposing the development of two independent deep learning-based protein design methods to
improve stability and to design protein-protein interactions from scratch. For the generation of de novo protein-
protein interactions (PPIs), we have previously developed a prototype algorithm. Sequence and interface
recovery indicate high accuracies for predicting hotspot interactions, both, for their surface locations, as well as
their identities. We previously established a stability predictor based on the evaluation of 31,000 designed
miniproteins. We aim to expand on our success and built a more complex neural network-based algorithm that
can guide re-design. We will integrate other published dataset, evolutionary information while also feeding back
any information obtained while optimizing for stability under strenuous conditions (e.g. low pH, high temperature,
high protease concentrations and in serum) of any of our designed proteins. We will ensure an iterative coupling
between computation and experimental evaluation."

Chloride channels contribute to airway health and disease by modulating airway secretion and mucociliary
function. We discovered that the channel regulator CLCA1 is a potent and specific potentiator of the TMEM16A
calcium-activated chloride channel, but there remains a major gap in understanding how this pair influences
airway biology. In order to fill this gap and develop therapies for mucus-obstructive diseases that target
CLCA1-mediated TMEM16A potentiation, the following are required: 1) a comprehensive understanding of
TMEM16A isoform expression patterns and biophysical properties in diseased airway; 2) an understanding of
how CLCA1-TMEM16A impact mucus properties in disease; and 3) the structural basis for CLCA1 potentiation
of TMEM16A. These points are addressed by each aim of this project. Since it is challenging to fully investigate
the potential mucus-modifying abilities of other channels in normal human airways due to the dominant activity
of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), we will utilize human cystic fibrosis (CF) models to study
CLCA1-TMEM16A biology in more depth. Investigating this system in CF also provides an opportunity to
evaluate other channels that may compensate for CFTR as therapeutic targets for patients unresponsive to
CFTR modulators. We have made a series of technical advances to facilitate our proposed studies
investigating the role this pair plays in human airway biology. First, we discovered a minimal domain of CLCA1
(CLCA1 VWA) that potentiates TMEM16A in cells, is stable and can be purified in large quantities for functional
studies. We have also devised ex vivo airway and human cellular models, using cystic fibrosis (CF) airway
tissue, primary CF cells and cell lines for detailed studies of TMEM16A activation in regulating mucociliary
function. Last, we have developed the tools required to determine the molecular structure of the CLCA1-
TMEM16A complex. To address the function of the CLCA1-TMEM16A system in human airway health and
disease, we propose a multidisciplinary investigation that incorporates banked human specimens, single cell
and spatial ‘omics, multicellular human models and state-of-the-art structural approaches. In Aim 1, we will
use single-nucleus RNAseq and merFISH to investigate expression dynamics of TMEM16A isoforms in CF
disease. In Aim 2, we will potentiate TMEM16A with CLCA1 VWA in CF airway tissue and cellular models to
characterize the impact of TMEM16A activation on beneficial mucus properties. In Aim 3, we will define the
molecular mechanism for CLCA1 activation of TMEM16A using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These
studies will examine the impact of CLCA1 potentiation of TMEM16A in human airway disease, which will
provide critical insight into broader regulation of TMEM16 family members relevant to lung biology and produce
the molecular framework to develop much needed novel therapeutics for muco-obstructive diseases."
10883116,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project addresses the NEI Audacious Goal Initiative (AGI) of restoring vision through regeneration of
photoreceptor cells and their connections. Among degenerative diseases of the outer retina amenable to
regenerative therapies, dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major target. AMD is the leading
cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries, with the dry form accounting for nearly 90% of patients
affected by this condition. Patients with end-stage dry-AMD present macular photoreceptor and retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) atrophy, and there is no available treatment that can restore their lost vision. To address this
important unmet need we need to address two critical gaps: devising novel cell-based transplantation
strategies to jointly regenerate photoreceptor and RPE cells, and identifying mechanisms supporting structural
and functional integration of the transplanted cells. The goal of this project is to directly address these two
critical gaps by establishing feasibility and mechanisms of structural and functional integration of a novel stem
cell-derived 3D retinal transplant containing photoreceptors and RPE (3DNR/RPE) in a minipig model of end-
stage macular atrophy. Our preliminary results showed survival of our 3DNR/RPE transplants within the
subretinal space of our minipig model. This was accompanied by increased light response six weeks post-
transplantation. These results strongly support our overarching hypothesis: that human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC)-derived 3DNR/RPE transplants achieve structural and functional integration. In these
studies, we will use an array of complementary multimodal in vivo ocular evaluation, ex vivo assessments, and
non-invasive in vivo functional imagining to determine the extent of structural and functional integration of our
hiPSC-derived 3DNR/RPE transplants. We will specifically test the following hypotheses: i) Co-transplanted
photoreceptors and RPE re-establish physiological and functional interactions; ii) Transplanted photoreceptors
synapse with both, co-transplanted and host bipolar cells, which in turn communicate with host amacrine
and/or ganglion cells; iii) 3DNR/RPE transplants lead to increased light response from all photoreceptor cell
types; and iv) 3DNR/RPE transplants lead to light-triggered response in bipolar and ganglion cells. This is a
highly innovative strategy grounded in our ability to generate retinal tissue transplants derived from hiPSC that
contain functional light-sensitive photoreceptors and RPE cells organized as in the native retina. Use of novel
high-resolution technology for non-invasive functional assessment of transplant integration is an additional
innovative aspect of our proposed studies. The potential impact of our studies is highly significant as it could
lead to critical preclinical evidence supporting the feasibility of hiPSC-derived 3DNR/RPE transplants for cell-
replacement therapy. In turn, this transplant strategy could become the first available solution for restoring
vision in patients affected by end-stage dry-AMD."
10881092,"Oxylipins comprise a rapidly growing in numbers class of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty
acids such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, linoleic
acid, etc. Collectively, oxylipins have been implicated in the regulation of a vast variety of physiological
responses from pain and inflammation to blood clotting and gastric acid secretion. As a result of important
physiological roles played by oxylipin mediators, their metabolic interconversions received an intense scrutiny.
To date, these efforts allowed to identify the main metabolic pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of major
classes of oxylipins. On the other hand, their catabolic interconversions, i.e. subsets of biochemical reactions
which frequently alter their biological activities, still remain rather poorly understood. Recently, we
demonstrated that human microsomal dehydrogenase reductase 9 (DHRS9) exhibits a robust activity oxidizing
hydroxyl groups of many important oxylipins such as pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 or pro-resolving
mediators such as resolvin D1 and lipoxin A4, for example. These findings strongly suggest that DHRS9
activity can alter the tissue balance between pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators and, thereby, affect
the progression of inflammation as well as the resolution of inflammation. In agreement with this hypothesis,
our preliminary data show that lungs of naïve, untreated DHRS9 deficient mice display all characteristic signs
of inflammation, which are further exacerbated by lipopolysaccharide treatment. Together, these observations
suggest that DHRS9 deficiency promotes lung inflammation and makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.
Thus, experiments outlined in this application have been designed to test our major working hypothesis that
DHRS9 is a highly potent oxylipin dehydrogenase with broad substrate specificity which plays a critically
important role in body’s ability to control inflammation. This hypothesis will be explored through the following
Specific Aims: 1) to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the broad substrate specificity of DHRS9 in order
to define the spectrum of its naturally occurring substrates and 2) to establish the physiological role of DHRS9
in controlling lung inflammation and injury. The results of these studies will define the pathways of oxylipin
metabolism controlled by DHRS9 and will lay the foundation for development of better informed therapeutic
approaches targeting lung inflammation."
10881154,"SUMMARY
Metabolic enzyme velocity (the product of activity and abundance) is shaped by the need of growing cells to
maintain metabolic flux while avoiding the accumulation of toxic intermediates and limiting inefficient
biosynthesis. Imbalances in enzyme velocity play a significant role in metabolic disease, and changes in enzyme
expression are often associated with drug resistance. Nonetheless, the connection between metabolic enzyme
expression, intracellular abundance, and cell growth rate is poorly characterized. Our long term goal is to create
a genome-scale model that quantitatively relates E. coli gene expression to growth rate phenotypes across both
common laboratory and host-associated conditions. We envision using this model for antibiotic discovery,
biosynthetic pathway engineering, and to interpret the effect of mutations in clinical isolates. Recently, we
developed a new modeling approach that predicts the growth rate effects of combinatorial variation in E. coli
gene expression and environment from sparsely sampled experimental training data. The basic strategy is to
first quantify the growth rate effects of gradated changes in gene expression across multiple environments and
genetic backgrounds of interest. Then, we use these data to parameterize a machine-learning model describing
the connection between gene expression and growth rate. We found that the model can predict the effects of at
least four combinatorial perturbations in gene expression and environment when trained on experimental data
considering only pairwise perturbations. The central goal of this grant is to now apply and extend this approach
to quantitatively understand the connection between enzyme abundance, growth rate, and antibiotic resistance
in E. coli. More specifically, we will: (1) identify and model the metabolic factors influencing trimethoprim
resistance in E. coli, (2) quantify the stoichiometric constraints on relative enzyme expression and abundance in
16 central metabolic pathways, and (3) apply new sequencing-based tools to simultaneously quantify gene
knockdown effects and growth rate across core metabolism. Together, this work will test hypotheses about the
modular organization of metabolism and yield a deeper understanding of the connection between metabolism
and antibiotic resistance. Moreover, our work in Aim 3 will generate a genome-scale collection of barcoded
strains for interrogating the dynamic connection between gene expression and growth rate across environments."

Social avoidance and exaggerated threat responding are transdiagnostic constructs related to stress-linked
disorders such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. We have found that these behaviors are
recapitulated in mice following exposure to uncontrollable, but not physically identical, controllable stress.
Further, we have found that the newly identified group of neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that
release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate mediate social avoidance and enhanced fear that result from
uncontrollable stress. However, VTA glutamate neurons are diverse in their projection targets and are capable
of releasing GABA or dopamine, in addition to glutamate, to distinct targets. We aim to determine which
downstream pathways of VTA glutamate neurons are affected by and control the behavioral consequences of
uncontrollable stress as well as identify the neurotransmitters within these pathways that control the outcomes
produced by uncontrollable stress. In Aim 1 we will determine the responsivity of VTA glutamatergic axons in
their two major projection targets, nucleus accumbens shell and lateral habenula, to inescapable or escapable
stress treatment, as well as during the outcomes produced by uncontrollable stress. Our preliminary data
suggests that inescapable stress potentiates VTA glutamatergic axons in lateral habenula and accumbens
shell following fear-inducing stimuli, but in different ways. We will also determine which downstream target of
VTA glutamate neurons is responsible for the development and maintenance of the behavioral consequences
of inescapable stress via select optogenetic photoinhibition of VTA glutamate axons. Preliminary data support
a role of the VTA glutamate pathway to LHb in the development of both social and fear-related consequences
of inescapable stress. Given that VTA glutamate neurons are capable of releasing glutamate, dopamine, or
GABA, we will identify which neurotransmitters released by VTA glutamate neurons are required for the social
and non-social consequences of inescapable stress. Additional studies will monitor how the loss of these
neurotransmitters from VTA glutamate neurons affects habenula and accumbens stress-induced activity.
Together the studies will identify at the intersection of cell-type, pathway, and neurotransmitter-specificity, how
stressor experience alters social, fear, and anxiety-like behavior."

Since the inception of the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC)
Consortium, the Mayo Clinic team has been an active participant, including leadership roles, in multiple
initiatives. A key priority of the Consortium is the facilitation of mechanism-based research of chronic
pancreatitis, pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus, and pancreatic cancer through systematically collected clinical
measures in longitudinal cohort studies linked with biospecimens. The goal of the Mayo Clinic team is to
contribute meaningfully to the most useful longitudinal cohorts that will increase our understanding of clinical,
epidemiological, and biological characterization of patients with these conditions. The primary longitudinal
cohort initiatives (outlined in the PAR) to which Mayo Clinic will continue to contribute are PROCEED and
NOD. Mayo Clinic investigators will also extend ancillary studies in PROCEED (salivary biomarkers and
internet based pain management techniques for pain in chronic pancreatitis (IMPACT)) that leverage the
extensive infrastructure in place. The Consortium has defined three Working Groups (WG) in which Mayo
Clinic investigators contribute and provide leadership (chronic pancreatitis (CP), Type 3c diabetes mellitus
(T3cDM); pancreatic cancer-DM WG. Our contribution includes solid accrual rates for these studies to date,
and successful completion of one ancillary study by the PI, active participation in the design of the NOD cohort
and subsequent modifications, and extending accrual for DETECT. Using the existing, highly productive
infrastructure we have established, our Specific Aims are to:
1) Continue to prospectively enroll and expand accrual of 100 Mayo patients into the PROCEED cohort.
 Using the clinical research infrastructure in place, we will also enroll chronic pancreatitis patients and
 subjects into ancillary studies within the CPDPC that include, among others: salivary biomarkers,
 MINIMAP, and PAIR.
2) Continue to prospectively enroll and expand accrual of 1,322 newly diagnosed diabetes patients into the
 NOD study.
3) Continue to lead and extend prospective accrual of 60 Mayo participants into the DETECT study.
To accomplish these aims, we will implement and identify new strategies to improve recruitment into the main
studies as well as ancillary studies at Mayo Clinic while providing to the CPDPC the scientific, clinical and
recruitment experience of our investigators."
10884503,"Destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans is central to the development of many forms of diabetes. As a result of beta cell loss, the body is unable to produce or respond to insulin, which leads to elevated blood glucose and abnormal metabolism. One potential approach to reverse the disease is to generate a therapy that specifically stimulates beta cell growth, thereby regenerating the lost cells and resolving metabolic dysfunction. My group is focused on understanding how the embryonic pancreas develops, with the goal to identify molecular pathways or specific factors that drive the expansion of beta cell mass. Specifically, current studies in the lab are investigating eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) and the hypusine biosynthesis pathway. eIF5A is a mRNA translation factor previously reported to play a role in cell proliferation but whose biology, to date, is relatively unexplored in pancreas development and beta cell regeneration. eIF5A is activated by the post-translational modification (“hypusination”) of a specific lysine residue by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). The active (hypusinated) form of eIF5A has been linked to postnatal beta cell stress. Moreover, a type 1 diabetes mouse model treated with a drug that targets the hypusination of eIF5A showed reduced incidence of diabetes. We recently made the discovery that hypusine biosynthesis is required for pancreas development. In particular, the absence of hypusine biosynthesis in the pancreas results in loss of pancreatic acinar (exocrine) cells. However, despite this dramatic loss of exocrine, there is actually an expansion of beta cell area and preserved islet function. From this preliminary work, we identified three fundamental, unanswered questions for our proposed studies: First, how does hypusine biosynthesis function to stimulate the expansion of beta cell mass? Second, are the signals that drive the beta cell growth emanating from exocrine cells? Third, can we exploit this mechanism to specifically regenerate the beta cells lost in individuals with diabetes? These questions will be answered in vivo and ex vivo, using both mouse and human-based tools. The proposed studies will define the interplay of exocrine and endocrine cell development and will identify novel targets that stimulate human beta cell growth."
10884504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of adolescents struggling with excess weight is remarkably high, with 38.7% of 12-15 year-olds
and 41.5% of 16-19 year-olds meeting criteria for overweight or obesity. While considerable attention has been
given to comprehensive behavioral interventions to address obesity in children, there is less empirical evidence
demonstrating efficacy of interventions with adolescents. Additionally, there is great variability in outcomes.
Limited impact of adolescent weight control treatment may be attributable to the failure of these interventions to
explicitly address key mechanisms that are necessary for successful weight loss. Notably, adolescents with
poorer emotion regulation have been found to consume foods of lower diet quality and report greater time
spent in sedentary behavior than their peers. Poor emotion regulation among adolescents has also been
associated with more rapid weight gain and higher BMI. Data from adolescents with overweight/obesity from
an outpatient weight management program at Hasbro Children's Hospital (N=124) indicate that 82% of these
youth report emotion regulation scores that are comparable to youth with significant mental health problems;
furthermore, there is a positive association between emotional dysregulation and BMI within this same
treatment-seeking sample. Despite these established relationships, interventions targeting emotion regulation
in adolescents with obesity are lacking. To fill this gap, our laboratory developed and piloted an adolescent
weight control intervention (HealthTRAC) that combines two efficacious interventions, one targeting emotion
regulation skill building, the other focused on behavioral weight control. Preliminary findings from the small pilot
trial are promising and indicate that the developed HealthTRAC intervention is acceptable, feasible to deliver,
and results in significant reduction in BMI (d=.58) and improvement in emotion regulation skills (d=.20-.35)
relative to a standard behavioral weight control (SBWC) condition. The proposed multi-site trial builds on these
previous findings and will evaluate the efficacy of the developed HealthTRAC intervention on improving
emotion regulation skills and reducing adolescent BMI. We propose to enroll 200 adolescents (100 per site)
between the ages of 13-17 years of age to receive either HealthTRAC or SBWC. Adolescents will be randomly
assigned to treatment condition within site. Intervention components will be delivered in 27.5 hours of direct
contact time across 12 months. All adolescents will be assessed prior to randomization (baseline), immediately
following the intervention (4 months), upon completion of maintenance sessions (12 months) and 18 months
after the start of intervention. The information gained in this project will extend our understanding of how
improving emotion regulation abilities can enhance adolescent weight control interventions."
10884505,"The continuation of the CPDPC will require the completion of the acquisition of subjects and
biospecimens, and sufficient follow-up to determine clinically relevant outcomes. Future efforts
for which the CPDPC was formed include includes biomarker development and validation, drug
development or repurposing, and therapeutic trials. Biomarker development and validation is
needed for such purposes as early diagnosis (chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer),
prognosis, risk stratification and precision therapy. A second clinical need is the development of
better therapies for the diabetes associated with pancreatic diseases, and better management
of the pancreatic diseases themselves. We propose one biomarker study for the next phase of
the CPDPC, a study of sarcopenia as a biomarker for worse outcome in patients with chronic
pancreatitis. We also propose 2 potential trials for the next phase of the CPDPC, one focused
on developing more effective therapy for pancreaticogenic (Type 3c) diabetes and one for a trial
assessing timing of surgical intervention in painful chronic pancreatitis:
 1. Finalize recruitment and follow-up of the PROCEED, DETECT, and NOD cohorts, and
 incorporate strategies to increase recruitment of NOD subjects. Recruitment, retention,
 and high quality data will need to be continued for all the cohorts. Recruitment into the
 NOD protocol has been most challenging. We will utilize the OneFlorida clinical data
 research network to identify partner health organizations within Florida to increase the
 pool of eligible study subjects in both NOD as well as future clinical trials.
 2. Characterize the prevalence, predictors, and impact of sarcopenia in patients with acute
 relapsing pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, and the interaction with coexistent
 diabetes; and establish strategies to identify and treat sarcopenia in these patients.
 While sarcopenia has been identified as a common consequence of pancreatic cancer,
 the prevalence of sarcopenia and clinical impact in patients with chronic pancreatitis is of
 equal clinical import.
 3. Implement a clinical trial within the CPDPC assessing the timing of surgical intervention
 in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis or relapsing pancreatitis. Pain is the most
 common symptom from chronic pancreatitis, the most common reason for intervention,
 and the most important detractor from quality of life. Medical, endoscopic, and surgical
 therapy are not highly effective, and the choice and timing of intervention for best
 outcomes is not known. A trial comparing outcomes from surgical therapy (drainage or
 resection) compared to endoscopic therapy in individuals with suitable anatomy who are
 not dependent on opioids and have not developed continuous pain is likely to identify
 more effective timing of therapy.
 4. Determine the most effective and safest management strategy for pancreaticogenic
 diabetes (Type 3c) in patients with chronic pancreatitis. These individuals have a mix of
 insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, and may be malnourished. The lack of
 pancreatic islet cell counterregulatory hormones make treatment-induced hypoglycemia
 a very significant risk, and the coexistence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may
 nutrient absorption less predictable. We propose a cross sectional analysis of patients
 entered into PROCEED and DETECT cohorts, followed by a trial of two treatment
 approaches (current standard medical therapy, versus newly available devices for
 continuous glucose monitoring and insulin therapy) to determine the most effective and
 safest strategies.
 This proposed work spans critical areas of knowledge deficit: the role of sarcopenia in
 chronic pancreatitis and relapsing acute pancreatitis, the most effective use of interventional
 therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain, and the management of the complex metabolic profiles
 of Type3c diabetes. These potential projects, if adopted by the continuation of the CPDPC,
 will appropriately utilize the resources generated by the first iteration of the CPDPC and the
 platform of clinical centers to realize the original goals and objectives of the CPDPC."

With a critical need to establish a workforce of specialists in neurodegenerative diseases focusing on Alzheimer’s
disease, there is an increasing demand for multidisciplinary scientists in the biomedical research community.
Despite this significant need, there are few training programs that provide experience in academic and clinical
settings. This proposal for an Alzheimer’s Disease and Related-Dementia Drug Discovery training program is
critical to meeting that increased demand. The overall goal of this program is to fund five predoctoral students
from the Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine to become experienced leaders in interdisciplinary research with
the ability to collaborate effectively on cross-disciplinary teams with broad expertise to address challenges within
target-based drug discovery. The program will help the selected students to develop keen scientific rigor and
translational skills necessary to compete and excel in the future workplace, including but not limited to academic
institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. Importantly, the program
faculty are drawn from a wide array of disciplines with many active collaborations. Twelve mentors are dedicated
to this training program, all either tenured or in tenure track positions, with the experience and funding to
undertake their training and mentoring roles. These faculty will provide trainees with a unique program in which
to learn techniques and methodologies of collaborative research projects. The proposed training program is
composed of formal didactic courses, discussion-based journal clubs and seminars, shadowing of a clinician and
mentored research leading to a doctoral thesis and Ph.D. degree within 5.5 years of entering graduate school.
This innovative program will produce an outstanding output of trainees with high accomplishments that will in
turn catalyze our recruitment of the best students for this interdisciplinary training program at the University of
Nebraska Medical Center."

Cardiometabolic disease refers to a set of clinically overlapping diseases, including coronary artery disease,
stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease and liver disease. These `cardiometabolic' diseases are
distinct but share common risk factors, including low density lipoprotein, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure,
central adiposity and glycemic measures. We label this set of inter-related and heritable metabolic and
hemodynamic traits the `cardiometabolic' (CM) heath profile. The CM health profile builds and extends the
metabolic syndrome paradigm to interrogate the disease risk heterogeneity, variables underlying
pathophysiology and predisposition to specific adverse consequences. Our focus is on examination of the
shared biology of the components and their role in the pathophysiology of CM disease endpoints, rather than
consideration of disease syndromes. Differences in end-organ consequences suggests that there may be
subtypes of the CM health profile with potentially different underlying pathophysiology and propensity for
adverse outcomes. We hypothesize that genetic analyses can enhance biological insights into CM health
profile component and disease endpoints by exploiting our mega-scale size sample of 1,365,750 subjects,
across five racial-ethnic groups, and consideration of pleiotropy, genetic subtyping, environmental modulation,
and causal inference analyses. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Pleiotropy, genetic classification and
association analysis of CM health profile components; 2) Gene x environment (GxE) interaction analyses of
CM disease endpoints; and 3) Causal inference analysis of CM health profile components, risk factors and
disease endpoints. There is a pressing need to better understand the genetic architecture of CM health profile,
relationship of components and their role in disease endpoints. If successful, this proposal will increase
genomic discovery, identify novel loci, and pathways, and enhance biological insights of CM health profile and
disease morbidity. We anticipate that our comprehensive approach to understand CM health profile biology will
bring us several steps closer towards identifying novel molecular targets and modifiable risks to achieve this
goal."

Cancer is a terrifying diagnosis, especially in a child, yet thanks to great advances in treatment, survival rates
have increased steeply. For CNS/brain tumors and leukemias, which together account for the majority of pedi-
atric cancers, these positive clinical outcomes generally require the use of CNS radiotherapy (RT). However, RT
causes significant long-term neurocognitive sequelae impacting not only cancer survivors, but also their caregi-
ver networks and society. Since RT is a scheduled ‘injury’, pretreatment is feasible, but the unclear nature of RT-
induced cognitive injury is a major obstacle to doing so. Research addressing RT-mediated cognitive deficits has
focused on the dividing neuroprogenitor cell (NPC) pool from which a small number of postnatal, “adult-born”
neurons arises in the dentate gyrus, as the hippocampus (of which the dentate gyrus is part) is particularly RT-
sensitive. While NPC damage likely contributes to cognitive decline, we and others have shown that terminally
differentiated neurons, long thought to be radioresistant, undergo marked synaptic alterations in response to
RT. In this proposal, we present data showing that radiation compromises the neuronal plasma membrane,
alters neuronal mitochondrial dynamics, and changes the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and
cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that APOE genotype associates with post-RT cognitive
outcomes in humans. These observations hearken to long-neglected studies on non-genetic loci of radiation
damage that could give us critical insights into the mechanisms of RT-mediated cognitive damage. Many
questions remain unanswered, however: How and to what extent do these mechanisms of irradiative damage,
including membrane permeabilization, contribute to cognitive decline? Does plasma membrane compromise
affect cellular Ca2+ signaling, a known cause of aging-related cognitive decline? How are these processes affected
by the delivery of lipids from astrocytes to neurons by ApoE? What are the consequences of epigenetic changes
that affect plasma membrane lipid composition? These are critical questions whose answers are required to
rationally design therapies to combat RT-induced neurocognitive sequelae. We propose to use a quantitative,
multidisciplinary approach to address these issues, including: (i) determining the consequences of RT-induced
plasma membrane compromise with regard to initial events and effects on mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ stores;
(ii) defining the role and site of action of the lipid carrier ApoE in the neuronal response to RT, while testing the
consequences of allelic variants of ApoE and the changes in surface glutamate receptors associated therewith;
and (iii) charting the nature and consequences of altered neuron lipidomes as a result of RT, including using a
bioinformatics approach to identify key pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Our novel and multidisci-
plinary approach will dissect the nature of RT-mediated cognitive dysfunction at the molecular, synaptic, cellu-
lar, and behavioral levels. The results of this translational proposal have the potential to greatly and positively
impact the health of cancer survivors and those otherwise exposed to radiation."

There are an estimated 50 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the care provided to people
with CKD and end stage kidney disease exceeds $114 billion annually. Despite these numbers, recent data
indicates that there is a significant workforce shortage in the field of nephrology and that the total number of
grants submitted to the NIH focused on kidney and urologic diseases and disorders has decreased over the past
decade. This dichotomy creates a significant need to reverse the current trends and increase the number of
trainees interested in pursuing a career in nephrology and urology that includes an NIDDK-related research
focus. To begin to address these important issues, we propose the development of a new Student Urinary Tract
Program in Education and Research (SUPER) Summer Program for undergraduate students with a strong focus
on diversity. This program will provide new educational, laboratory and clinical experiences for undergraduate
students promoting a better understanding of kidney and urinary tract diseases as well as careers in Nephrology
and Urology. In addition, the SUPER-Summer Program is designed to integrate into a wide range of pre-existing
training programs at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital providing a seamless NIDDK-
focused workforce pipeline. We strongly believe that creating this innovative and well-structured SUPER-
Summer Program focused on nephrology and urology related topics will capture student interest early in their
career development - thereby increasing the potential workforce population and diversity creating a strong
foundation for the next generation of NIDDK-research focused clinicians and scientists."

 Neutrophils play critical roles during different stages of tumor development. In mice, systemic depletion of
neutrophils results in decreased tumor growth in glioblastoma (GBM) and lung cancer, but promote tumor growth
in pre-metastatic lung and other solid tumors, indicating their stage-specific and tissue-dependent functions in
tumor progression. Neutrophils could also facilitate cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and
immunotherapy in different tumors by releasing various cytokines. Despite these preclinical and animal studies
on tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), a knowledge gap remains in our mechanistic understanding of how
human neutrophils regulate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance in GBM, due to the short life and
resistance to gene editing of neutrophils as well as technical hurdles in isolating stage-specific TANs. To address
this gap, we propose to harness the power of microfluidics and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
to interrogate the diversity and plasticity of neutrophils in human GBM development. Elucidating the underlying
mechanism will also enable the much-needed development and evaluation of neutrophil-targeted cancer therapy.
Our central hypothesis here is that the microfluidic model will recapitulate the different stages of human tumor
progression, providing a platform for phenotypic and mechanistic understanding of the roles of neutrophils in
GBM development. To test this hypothesis, we will implement a novel interstitial tumor-microenvironment-on-
chip (iT-MOC), and interrogate neutrophil-mediated tumor progression and therapeutic resistance at different
GBM growth stages in Aim 1. Then in Aim 2, we will determine the morphology, polarization, life-span and
antitumor cytotoxicity of GBM-infiltrating neutrophils. In Aim 3, we will reprogram tumor-associated neutrophils
towards antitumor effector cells via genetic engineering of hiPSCs with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and
microRNAs (miRNAs). This is a novel approach as human neutrophils cannot be genetically modified. Successful
completion of these aims will offer an innovative platform to study the diversity and plasticity of TANs, and provide
insights into reprograming them towards antitumor effector cells and the proof-of-concept for CAR-neutrophils in
targeted cancer therapy."

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ancient cofactors composed of multiple iron and sulfur atoms. They are
fundamental to numerous biological processes in all domains of life. Owing to the rich, tunable redox reactivity
and selectivity of the cluster, Fe-S proteins play multifaced roles in redox control under both physiological and
stress conditions. The roles of Fe-S proteins in redox control are vital for the maintenance of normal cellular
functions and cell survival, and thus they are tightly linked to health and disease such as cancer and diabetes in
human and bacterial infection. This contrasts vividly with the lack of functional, structural and mechanistic
understanding of many Fe-S proteins in the cellular control of redox homeostasis, particularly in the three core
aspects that are addressed in this MIRA proposal: i) redox sensing and transcriptional regulation by Fe-S proteins;
ii) assembly, transfer and repair of Fe-S clusters; and iii) crosstalk between Fe-S proteins and the low-molecular-
weight (LMW) thiols in redox hemostasis. Several Fe-S proteins-mediated mechanisms for redox control in
mycobacteria will be used as examples to elaborate our research goals and approaches in this proposal,
including i) redox sensing and transcriptional regulation by a unique family of Fe-S cluster-bound transcription
factors in the WhiB-like family; ii) assembly, transfer and repair of Fe-S clusters by the SUF system; and iii)
mycothiol in Fe-S cluster homeostasis. The proposed research program is built on the unique combination of
skills and rich research experience in my research team that are crucial for characterizing the oxygen-sensitive
metal-binding proteins. We recently determined the first and long-desired Fe-S cluster-bound structure of the
monomeric transcription factor WhilB1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and established a new mechanism of
bacterial transcriptional regulation mediated by this protein. By combining structural, spectroscopic and
biochemical approaches in vitro with molecular biology in vivo, we are poised to determine: i) the structural basis
of redox reactivity and ligand selectivity in Fe-S clusters; ii) the mechanism by which the redox state and integrity
of the Fe-S cluster allows these proteins to sense redox state and regulate transcription; iii) the structural
biochemistry of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis and regulation; and iv) the role of non-proteinaceous thiols in
modulating Fe-S cluster-mediated redox control. Altogether, the proposed research program will establish a new
line of ground-breaking research in an understudied aspect of redox homeostasis. The strategies developed
from the proposed program will be instrumental for studies on the newly discovered Fe-S cluster system, such
as those in the DNA repair and RNA metabolism in response to oxidative stress. Because of their critical roles
in redox control, the study of the novel mechanisms of these Fe-S proteins will not only shed light on the
fundamental molecular mechanism governing Fe-S protein-mediated redox control, but also have a significant
impact on improving health and combating infectious diseases."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) presents a formidable therapeutic challenge, as current interventions have failed
to slow disease progression. The majority of AD genetic risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-
coding regions of the genome, suggesting that alterations in gene expression contribute to susceptibility for
sporadic AD. Multiple reports now suggest that Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1) and other microbes can
accumulate in the brain to increase the incidence of AD/dementia. While there is evidence linking reactivation
of latent HSV1 infection to AD, the pathological potential of the latent state per se has not been addressed.
Furthermore, there is now concern that COVID-19, which is caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and can
include neurological and neurocognitive sequelae, might impact the onset or course of AD. Here we propose to
advance recent findings by employing powerful new genomic technologies to characterize the cell type-specific
transcriptional impact and cell autonomous vs non-cell autonomous effects of specific viral gene products,
including HSV1 latency lncRNA transcripts and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, that contribute to neurotoxic
programs characteristic of sporadic AD. Using a modified single-nucleus sequencing approach, which allows
for DNA accessibility and global transcription to be assessed simultaneously in the same nucleus, we will
continue our interrogation of human control and AD brain samples to reveal cell type-specific aging vs
pathological trajectory trees for each CNS cell type in sporadic AD, ultimately allowing for the identification of the
key transcription factors acting at implicated regulatory enhancers. This will enable us to elucidate how viral
gene products alter enhancer landscapes and transcriptional networks related to sporadic AD in various neuronal
and non-neuronal cell types and subtypes. In addition, we will investigate the hypothesis that the sense (S) and
antisense (AS) LATs impact transcription by associating with specific regulatory elements in the host genome in
collaboration with the co-regulator KAP1 to impact expression of multiple AD susceptibility loci. We further
hypothesize that the S-LAT influences the AD process by causing neuronal dysfunction and inflammatory glial
activation, at least in part, through down-regulation of gene clusters encoding KRAB zinc-finger proteins (KZFPs)
that normally repress human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) repeats, whereas the AS-LAT tempers these
deleterious effects by promoting an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile and can further mitigate the innate
immune response as well as cell death programs through direct inhibition of the AD-associated, sentinel kinase
PKR in a non-genomic fashion. Collectively, the proposed studies will yield crucial cell type-specific insights into
pathological trajectories in sporadic AD that may be subject to modulation by diverse infectious as well as non-
microbial insults to the brain."

 Carbenes are versatile reactive intermediates capable of engaging in cycloaddition, bond insertion,
rearrangement, and coupling reactions. Previous efforts to develop catalytic variants of carbene transfer
reactions have largely focused on the use of diazoalkanes. The primary limitation of this approach is that
diazoalkanes generally must be stabilized with electron-withdrawing or aryl groups in order to avoid the
spontaneous, exothermic elimination of dinitrogen gas. The overarching goal of this program is to study
transition metal catalyzed reductive carbene transfer reactions that use readily available gem-dihalo reagents
as precursors to non-stabilized carbenes. Catalytic turnover can be achieved using chemical reductants, such
as metal powders. Alternatively, the use of photoredox or electrocatalytic reduction makes these reactions
compatible with emerging flow synthesis platforms.
 A broad scope of catalytic cycloaddition reactions will be developed. A particular focus will be on
generating odd-membered rings, which are challenging to access by conventional thermal pericyclic
processes. For example, transition metal catalysis will allow current limitations of the Simmons–Smith reaction
to be addressed, such as the enantioselective synthesis of dimethyl-, spiro-, and methylenecyclopropanes.
Asymmetric [4 + 1]-cycloadditions of vinylidenes and 1,3-dienes will generate complex cyclopentene
derivatives. Finally, three-component [n + m + 1]-cycloadditions will be developed for the synthesis of five- and
seven-membered carbocycles and heterocycles. Some of these reactions will use dinuclear metal catalysts,
which provide a unique active site environment to mediate carbene and vinylidene transfer reactions.
 Transition metal-catalyzed additions of vinylidenes to alkenes can also be diverted to non-cycloaddition
pathways by intercepting metalacyclic intermediates prior to ring closure. Reaction design is based on
promoting β-X elimination or transmetalation reactions of these metalacycles. Based on this concept, novel
carbon–carbon coupling reactions will be developed for the synthesis of chiral alcohol and amine products.
 The catalysis concepts developed in this project will impact human health by providing access to complex
C(sp3)-rich frameworks that can be incorporated into biological probes and therapeutics."

 Leishmania parasites cause a suite of devastating Neglected Tropical Diseases that afflict as many as
one million people per year. At least 20,000 are killed each year by the deadly visceral form of the disease,
which is caused by L. donovani. Genetic tools for understanding important questions in Leishmania biology are
currently quite limited. Most Leishmania species lack the capacity for RNA interference (RNAi), which
precludes the implementation of genome-scale RNAi library screens like those that have revolutionized
molecular genetics in the related kinetoplastid T. brucei. As is the case for knocking down protein expression
via RNAi, expressing proteins at higher levels than normal (i.e., overexpression) can confer resistance to drugs
or otherwise enhance survival (Gain-of-Fitness = GnFt), or cause deleterious effects on cell fitness (Loss-of-
Fitness = LsFt) that can reveal important pathways and protein functions. Genome-scale overexpression
libraries have proven valuable for a wide range of genetic screens in multiple species, including T. brucei. The
goal of this proposal is to generate and validate a novel, genome-scale, inducible overexpression library in
Leishmania that will serve as a versatile and broadly applicable new genetic tool for the field.
 We propose to generate a library encoding the majority of L. donovani proteins (~7500 Open Reading
Frames, or LdORFs). PCR amplified LdORFs will be directionally cloned into Gateway Entry vectors to
facilitate transfer of the library to any Gateway compatible vector (Aim 1), resulting in a LdORFeome plasmid
library. The LdORFeome will be transferred into novel inducible Leishmania expression vectors developed in
our lab (Aim 1). The resulting library will be stably transfected into Leishmania to generate an inducible
Leishmania donovani ORFeome overexpression library (the LdOX library). Because the overall goal is to
make the LdOX library available as a resource for the community, we will validate the library by performing
proof-of-principle overexpression screens to identify drug resistance genes (GnFt) and pathways required for
normal growth (LsFt) (Aim2).
 The LdOX library will provide an innovative and much-needed new tool for high throughput genetic
screens in Leishmania. We anticipate that screens with the LdOX library will have a sustained impact on the
field by revealing mechanisms of drug action and resistance, and uncovering proteins and pathways required
for surviving any growth condition or lifecycle stage."
10885132,"Over the past few decades, research involving the neural control of breathing has centered on how the
breathing rhythm is generated and how sensory systems detect internal and external changes to modulate the
breathing pattern. While we have learned that the regulatory breathing rhythm originates in the medulla, we
know little about the neural circuits by which breathing affects emotional state. The positive effects of controlled
breathing on emotional state have been observed across many contexts and in the clinic. Using objective
behavioral, physiological, and neuroanatomical parameters, we propose: i) to fully determine the neural
pathways in mice from the preBötzinger Complex, the key site generating inspiratory rhythm in the medulla, to
supramedullary regions, in particular to the locus coeruleus and its ascending projections, that effect and/or
affect emotional state, and; ii) to establish the role of these projections from the preBötzinger Complex in
mediating the effects of breathing on anxiety, fear and panic in mice. The proposed research has the potential
to lead to more effective methods for treating debilitating negative emotional states"
10884017,"In most older adults, memory and other cognitive abilities decline with advancing age. This decline is not
inevitable, however. Recent studies from our laboratory and others indicate that some older adults maintain
youthful cognitive function at advanced age. This cognitive resilience may be related to motivational factors, as
successful agers show a stronger tendency to maintain effort in the face of challenging tasks than their peers.
This quality is sometimes called grit (i.e., persistence of effort, perseverance). Recent findings also indicate that
high-grit successful agers are resilient to memory decline even when they exhibit neuropathologic changes
associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as the accumulation of beta amyloid. This suggests that higher levels
of grit may convey cognitive resilience in cognitively normal amyloid positive adults who are at elevated risk to
develop AD (preclinical AD). The neural underpinnings of this resilience are not presently well understood.
However, a number of limbic and paralimbic structures associated with motivation have been found to be
relatively preserved in successful agers. The most notable of these structures is the anterior mid-cingulate cortex
(MCC). The activity and connectivity of this region predicts persistence on difficult tasks, and stimulation of this
region produces “the will to persevere”, suggesting a central role for this region in representing grit in the brain.
In this proposal we will expand on prior research which has relied solely on correlative designs and propose a
novel model – The Neural Grit Model of Cognitive Aging – to test the relationships between grit, MCC function
and memory in a causal way. Our central hypothesis is that MCC functional and structural integrity mediates the
protective role of grit against age-related cognitive decline. To test this central hypothesis, we propose to
modulate the functional connectivity of the MCC using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We
will assess the effects of rTMS-induced MCC connectivity on grit and memory in 40 amyloid-positive (Aβ+)
cognitively normal older adults (preclinical AD) and 40 healthy cognitively normal older adults who are amyloid
negative (Aβ-). All older adults will undergo behavioral testing and brain imaging (structural and functional
connectivity MRI) before and after 2 weeks of brain stimulation using rTMS. We predict that: 1) Higher levels of
grit will predict more persistent effort and better memory function, 2) Greater structural integrity and functional
connectivity of the MCC will be associated with higher levels of grit and will mediate the relationship between grit
and memory, 3) MCC-targeted rTMS will enhance MCC connectivity, grit and memory performance, particularly
in amyloid-negative individuals. This proposal is innovative in that it represents the first attempt to demonstrate
a causal relationship between MCC function, grit, and memory. It is significant, as establishing this relationship
points to MCC function as a biomarker for cognitive resilience in aging. Additionally, if enhancing MCC
connectivity does augment grit, this research could lead to the development of interventions targeting the MCC
to enhance motivation and potentially protect against age-related cognitive decline."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer-predisposing syndrome afflicting
~1 in every 3,500 persons worldwide with the majority of patients developing benign plexiform and/or dermal
neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas constitute a lifelong source of disfigurement, morbidity and mortality,
and have the potential to transform to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), an aggressive soft
tissue sarcoma. In fact, approximately 15% of NF1 patients develop poor prognosis MPNSTs, often in the
second or third decade of life. Treatment options for MPNSTs are limited to complicated surgical procedures
and classical chemotherapy and, so far, molecular targeted therapies have demonstrated limited efficacy. We
desperately need new treatment options for the MPNSTs and methods to prevent them from development. It
was recently found that plexiform neurofibromas progress to MPNST via an intermediate, “atypical”
neurofibroma (ANF) that in 70% of tumors shows heterozygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A the gene
encoding p16INK4a and p14ARF (Beert et al., 2011; Pemov et al., 2018). Our proposal will address critical unmet
needs in this field, including better in vitro and in vivo models of ANF and identification of critical vulnerabilities
of these cells. To provide a model for preclinical testing and prevention of ANF to MPNST development, we
combined Desert hedgehog (Dhh)-Cre driven biallelic deletion of Nf1 with heterozygous loss of Cdkn2a,
creating a unique model of transplantable ANF developing within pre-existing neurofibroma (Chaney et al.,
submitted). We also combined Dhh-Cre driven biallelic deletion of Nf1 and Pten, generating rapidly developing
perinatal ANF-like lesions (Keng et al., 2012). ANF from Dhh-Cre;Nf1fl/fl;Cdkn2a+/- mice grafted
subcutaneously into immunocompromised hosts grew, after a delay, providing a more rapid, tractable,
transformation system. We plan a complete transcriptome and exome analysis in these models (Aim 1a), and
further investigate the model by identifying and validating cell populations and markers altered in mouse
and human PNF, ANF, and MPNST in unperturbed tissue sections using a new image analysis
method called CO-Detection by IndEXing (Aim 1b). Modulation of the immune environment is increasing
used therapeutically. We will therefore define the influence of the nerve microenvironment and immune system
on progression from ANF to MPNST (Aim 1c). To identify ANF vulnerabilities, we have completed drug and
CRISPR-based genetic synthetic lethality screens in isogenic immortalized human Schwann cells that are NF1
wildtype or were made homozygous for NF1 loss of function mutations using gene editing. Candidate drugs
that inhibit PP2A, and other novel targets from the drug screening effort, will be tested for their effects in ANF-
like cells in vitro (Aim 2a) and, when successful, in our unique GEMMs (Aim 2b). Similarly, our genetic
screening effort will be used to define additional vulnerabilities tested in vitro (Aim 2c) and in vivo (Aim 2d)."

Postpartum hemorrhage, defined as estimated blood loss of at least 1000 mL within 24 hours of delivery, is the
leading cause for severe maternal morbidity and mortality. Annually, postpartum hemorrhage complicates 2-3%
of all pregnancies and accounts for 140,000 maternal deaths globally. In the United States, there are also
significant racial disparities: Black women have a five-fold higher risk of hemorrhage-related death compared to
non-Black women. While clinical postpartum hemorrhage risk prediction tools have been developed, they fail to
identify up to 40% of cases; as a result, no evidence-based prediction tool is currently widely adopted in clinical
practice. Thus, an efficient, precise, and personalized postpartum hemorrhage risk prediction tool is urgently
needed. Recently, machine learning approaches have been increasingly used to develop accurate predictive
models with superior performance compared to the traditional statistical approaches and to discover new
predictors, with little prior pre-specification. Moreover, the explainable machine learning methods allow for
transparent decision making and reduction of bias. In this way, machine learning models may lead to more
accurate postpartum hemorrhage prediction than currently existing tools. In addition, since up to 18% of
postpartum hemorrhage risk is familial and many of the clinical risk factors associated with postpartum
hemorrhage have a well-established polygenic architecture, using polygenic risk tools may further enhance
postpartum hemorrhage risk prediction. In line with the NIH IMPROVE initiative goals to improve maternal safety
and outcomes, we propose here to develop a high-fidelity algorithm, combining both clinical and genetic factors,
to more accurately predict the risk of postpartum hemorrhage in pregnant individuals. We will leverage our rich
patient database and state-of-the-art computational tools to: (1) develop an improved algorithm to stratify patient
postpartum hemorrhage risk with a focus on transparency and bias reduction, and (2) delineate the contribution
of the genetics to postpartum hemorrhage risk. Overall, this project will advance our ability to precisely predict
patients at risk for postpartum hemorrhage, with the investigation of novel predictors, interaction between clinical
and genetic contributors, and novel application of both machine learning and polygenic risk scores to these
outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to validate and implement these tools in clinical practice, leading to greatly
enhanced ability to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality. By completion of these aims, I will develop a
specific skill set essential for establishing my research trajectory and transition to independence as a physician-
scientist utilizing translational computational approaches to predict and improve adverse obstetric outcomes."

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) form the basis for transformative cell therapies for retinal blindness, which affects
over 300M worldwide. Yet, the mechanisms by which ubiquitous chromatin modifiers, like WDR5, cooperate with
broadly expressed, embryonic transcription factors (TFs), like p53 and MAX, control retinogenesis are unknown.
This knowledge gap affects critical fields. p53 activation, a feature of CHARGE and other syndromes, triggers
retinal defects via undetermined pathways. Transplantation of p53-mutant ESC-derived retinal cells continue in
clinical trials but it is not known if p53 regulates ESC retinal fate determination. A $1 billion effort to develop
WDR5 inhibitors is ongoing. Yet, little is known about WDR5 beyond its role in promoting transcription as a co-
factor of the MLL chromatin modifying complex, which methylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me). Thus,
predicting the outcome of these medical interventions remain challenging. During the PI’s K08 award period, we
discovered that WDR5 regulates p53 stability to promote retinogenesis. Further, our preliminary data reveals
that WDR5 directly interacts with p53 and MAX to regulate non-retinal lineage specification, mesoderm and germ
cell/meiosis-related transcription. The objective of the proposed research is to understand how interplay of
ubiquitous chromatin modifiers and TFs at a critical developmental window trigger the earliest events of
retinogenesis. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that WDR5 interacts with p53 and MAX on chromatin
in a time-dependent manner to promote retinogenesis by activating retinal-specific genes and by repressing non-
retinal, lineage-specifying loci. We will test this hypothesis through three aims: (1) Delineate functions of WDR5,
p53, and of loci that co-recruit WDR5 and p53, during retinogenesis; (2) Define molecular interactions of WDR5
and MAX that inhibit non-retinal fates during retinal specification; (3) Determine the role of the WDR5-p53 cell
fate pathway during lineage specification of pluripotent cells in vivo. Our approach is significant and innovative
because it employs state-of-the-art technologies, such as CUT&RUN, CRISPR-Cas9 editing, single cell
transcriptome profiling, and ESC-derived 3D organoid platforms, to obtain foundational insights about the earliest
events of retinogenesis. Our research will address non-canonical functions of popularly-studied proteins, such
as roles for WDR5 that control eye field TF activity, trigger gene repression and cell fate functions of p53 and
MAX distinct from tumorigenesis. Thus, gleaned insights will represent substantial departures from conventional
views. Our insights will vertically advance and fundamentally alter our understanding of how ubiquitous chromatin
modifiers and TFs interact in a temporal manner to initiate retinogenesis. Results from our studies will advance
key concepts related to how p53 activation triggers retinal defects in p53-associated syndromes, mechanisms
by which existing p53 alterations in ESC lines alter non-retinal lineage differentiation in ongoing cell therapy
trials, and prediction of off-target effects of ‘therapeutic’ WDR5 inhibitors that are currently in development."

As many as two-thirds of teens who are pregnant or parenting have been the victims or perpetrators of
physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and there is an even higher prevalence of psychological abuse in
this population. IPV can endanger teen mothers’ own health, the health of their pregnancies, and the well-
being of their children. Despite this detrimental impact, there is a lack of evidence-based IPV prevention
programs that are tailored for pregnant and parenting teens. Moreover, despite the promise of virtual
program delivery, which may help improve teens’ ability to attend, research has yet to determine feasibility
and outcomes of virtual delivery of IPV prevention programs for teens who are pregnant or parenting. The
proposed study will adapt the Safe Dates for Teen Mothers (SDTM) program for virtual delivery, in which
participants attend synchronous group sessions with a facilitator via a virtual platform. The original Safe
Dates is a 10-session, theoretically based, interactive program with demonstrated efficacy in preventing
psychological, physical, and sexual dating abuse among teens. We adapted Safe Dates for teen girls who
are pregnant or parenting by integrating pregnancy and parenting themes throughout program sessions,
increasing the focus on overcoming barriers to seeking help for IPV, and revising sexual assault content.
Compared with the original intervention, SDTM was more feasible to implement with fidelity, was more
acceptable to participants, and was associated with more favorable changes in intermediate outcomes. The
programs were delivered exclusively in person. Before testing this intervention in a large-scale randomized
trial, we need to assess whether delivery of the program via a virtual platform could help to overcome known
barriers to attendance and improve retention, which is critical to testing program efficacy. The aims of the
research are to (1) adapt SDTM for virtual delivery and assess implementation outcomes and (2) estimate
preliminary effects of virtual SDTM, relative to an equal attention control condition, on physical and sexual
IPV and other salient abusive behaviors over a 6-month period. We will adapt SDTM activities for virtual
delivery using iterative input from facilitators and program participants. Then we will conduct a randomized
controlled trial with 80 pregnant and parenting teen girls. Practitioners at partner agencies will facilitate virtual
SDTM and an equal attention control program (virtual health education program lessons that do not address
IPV). We will collect teen surveys at baseline and 6-month follow-up, record attendance and measure
engagement of teens in virtual SDTM, and conduct individual interviews with facilitators and selected
participants. This project will expand the preliminary evidence for SDTM, setting the stage for a future trial to
examine longer term program effects across geographically diverse sites. Adapting SDTM for virtual delivery
will establish a method for providing IPV prevention programming to teens who are pregnant or parenting
that can be widely disseminated and improve maternal and child health in this vulnerable population."
10889434,"Type IV pili (T4P) are extraordinarily widespread surface appendages made by many species of extant
archaea and bacteria as well as by the last universal common ancestor. T4Ps are assembled by a complex,
multi-component machine that consumes energy from ATP hydrolysis. Many human pathogens require T4P for
virulence. Volunteer studies have proven that T4P of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Vibrio
cholerae, which make type IVb pili (T4bP) that diverged from other T4P early in evolutionary history, are
required for illness in people. Despite remarkable progress, the molecular details of T4P assembly remain
obscure. The overall structure of the T4P machinery is remarkably conserved, but closer investigation reveals
fundamental differences among systems. Which findings from convenient model systems can be extrapolated
to pathogens remains unclear. For example, we recently solved the structure of the BfpD extension ATPase
from EPEC to 3.0 Å resolution using cryo-EM. In contrast to the two-fold symmetry and complex enzyme
kinetics of the distantly-related extension ATPases from thermophiles, the BfpD ATPase has six-fold symmetry
and simple kinetics, consistent with a concerted mechanism of catalysis rather than the symmetric rotary
mechanism proposed for its counterparts. In the current brief, circumscribed multi-investigator proposal, we
aim to determine to what extent the structure and mechanism of catalysis exhibited by BfpD is representative
of other potentially lethal human pathogens. To do so, we have purified the extension ATPases from four other
pathogens. Since initial (A0) submission of this revised (A1) proposal, we collected cryo-EM images of the PilB
extension ATPase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 2D classes from these images demonstrate
unambiguous two-fold symmetry like the structures obtained from thermophiles with which it is closely related.
Furthermore, the structure of one such enzyme, which was derived from X-ray crystallography, fits well into our
3D PilB model, currently at 3.4 Å resolution. In the first aim of the current proposal, we will use cryo-EM to
determine the structure of the TcpT ATPase from Vibrio cholerae, which is more closely related to EPEC BfpD
than to those from thermophiles or P. aeruginosa. This structure will reveal whether it has two-fold, six-fold, or
perhaps even three-fold symmetry. In Aim 2 we will perform careful enzyme kinetic studies to determine
whether each of the four additional extension ATPases that we purified exhibits classic Michaelis-Menten
monophasic kinetics like BfpD or complex multiphasic kinetics like the extension ATPase described for a
thermophilic bacterium.
 Differences among diverse T4P systems indicate that efforts to develop new approaches to prevent and
treat lethal bacterial pathogens will benefit from a better understanding of which essential features of T4P are
specific to a subset of the organisms and which are universal. As the extension ATPase is a potential target for
anti-virulence therapeutics, the efforts described herein will provide important information regarding its
mechanism of action in pathogens."

The clinical manifestations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDDs) are thought to be caused by an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. We have
discovered that changes in activity cause long-term changes in the intracellular architecture of neurons. The
long-term changes occur through the formation of novel organelles, called Golgi satellites (GSats), that have
many of the functions of the Golgi apparatus (GA) in the soma. Preliminary data demonstrate that activity
changes cause GSats to position at synapses, particularly in dendrites at spine heads. Preliminary data also
show that the ASD- and NDD-related protein Ube3a localizes to GSats, and that this association is increased in
response to neuronal stimulation. At dendritic synaptic sites, GSats are the “missing” organelles needed for
proper glycosylation of locally translated membrane and secreted proteins important for synaptic plasticity. GSat
formation transforms local secretory pathways at postsynaptic sites so that locally translated membrane and
secreted proteins are properly glycosylated. In addition, multiple glycoproteins which are both associated with
ASD and involved in synaptic function are endocytosed into early endosomes and then trafficked into GSats
where glycans can again be processed. Through these functions, GSats can remodel the neuronal surface
glycoproteome and mediate rapid changes in the sialic acid content of synaptic glycoproteins. These processes
can lead to changes in protein function which can then contribute to the altered synaptic function observed in
ASD and NDDs.
In this proposal we will examine how GSats interact with the products of the ASD- and NDD-risk gene UBE3A.
The association of Ube3a with GSats is hypothesized to regulate GSat acidification, which in turn influences the
activity of resident sialyltransfereases and their ability to remodel the neuronal surface glycoproteome and
rapidly alter synaptic protein sialic contents. We will determine how changes in Ube3a expression alters sialic
acid content at synapses and on a set of synaptic and ASD-related glycoproteins. We will also characterize how
changes in Ube3a expression regulate activity-induced modulation of GSat formation and localization in relative
to synapse, how these changes correlate with synaptic plasticity. We have developed a series of techniques,
assays and preparations that will allow us to perform these experiments in both primary neuronal cultures and
in ex vivo mouse hippocampal preparations."

Viral vectors enjoy widespread use for gene transfer to multiple cell types and organ systems in both research
studies and, increasingly, in therapeutic strategies. For studies of the CNS, the ability of the viral vector to
effectively and selectively infect the desired cell types within the CNS plays a critical role in the subsequent
interpretation of study outcomes. However, most viral vectors are somewhat promiscuous in their cell type
specificity. Although a particular vector pseudotype may primarily infect one type of cell, the additional “off-
target” infection of other cell types may introduce unwanted variance to the study outcomes. In some recent
studies, the intended infection of astrocytes also resulted in the unwanted infection of neurons, undermining
the studies’ conclusions. Thus, there is a need to improve the current state of cell-type tropism to one of cell-
type selectivity to specifically and exclusively target the desired cell type and eliminate off-target effects. A
similar unmet need is the lack of a tool to selectively target a previously infected cell for a subsequent “follow-
up” gene delivery. In this Exploratory/Developmental R21 mechanism project, we propose to build upon the
popular expression of the avian TVA receptor used to enable EnvA-pseudotyped rabies virus delivery of a
fluorescent reporter gene for transsynaptic labeling in the CNS. Our aims are in the context of our interest to
perform direct in vivo cellular reprogramming of glial progenitor cells into neurons. In aim 1, we will use our
current retroviral approach to infect proliferating glial progenitor cells in the adult brain to express the avian
TVA receptor. We will then be able to selectively target the TVA-expressing glial progenitor cells for gene
transfer using EnvA-pseudotyped lentivirus. In aim 2, we will directly target the glial progenitor cells by
pseudotyping lentivirus to exclusively bind to a cell-specific membrane receptor. This will facilitate the
demonstration of targeted infection of glial progenitor cells through selective and exclusive gene transfer.
Including TVA in the cell specific receptor-pseudotyped lentivirus construct will permit subsequent selective
targeting by EnvA-pseudotyped lentivirus for delivery of subsequent reprogramming factors or other gene
transfer."

Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, men consistently lag behind women along each step of the HIV care
cascade and contribute to HIV transmission among women. Disclosure of HIV is a key step in prevention,
however, few evidence-based resources exist to support HIV disclosure among men with HIV (MWH) in sub-
Saharan Africa. Candidate: My long-term goal is to become an independent, NIH-funded clinical researcher
dedicated to interventions to support HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and treatment in
resource limited settings. Mentoring: Drs. Jessica Haberer (clinical trial implementation) and Lynn Matthews
(methods for intervention development; co-primary mentors) are both successful NIH-funded investigators who
have both mentored multiple NIH career development awardees. Drs. Winnie Muyindike (HIV clinical care
engagement and outcomes), Andrew Mujugira (male engagement in HIV and STI care and research), Christina
Psaros (behavioral science theory), Seth Kalichman (HIV disclosure and assisted partner notification), and
Bethany Hedt-Gauthier (advanced clinical trial analysis and biostatistics) will provide additional focused
mentorship to ensure success. Research: The goal of this proposal is to develop and test an HIV disclosure
intervention focused on MWH meeting the following eligibility criteria: with STI symptoms who are either not
accessing antiretroviral therapy or are accessing antiretroviral therapy but without viral suppression. In Aim 1, I
will identify the unique HIV disclosure needs and preferences to support HIV disclosure through in-depth
qualitative interviews with up to 30 MWH meeting eligibility criteria. In Aim 2, I will utilize the findings from Aim
1 to adapt interventions with HIV disclosure components in order to develop a novel HIV disclosure
intervention focused on MWH. The intervention will be iteratively refined through focus group discussions with
up to 20 participants, their sexual partners, and a community advisory board. In Aim 3, I will recruit 70 MWH
meeting eligibility criteria for participation in a randomized controlled trial to pilot test the intervention against an
attention-matched control group. Participants will be encouraged to bring their sexual partners for study
enrollment and HIV testing and counseling. Up to 15 MWH and their sexual partners will be invited for
qualitative interviews. I will measure the primary outcomes of acceptability and feasibility by mixed methods.
Training: To achieve my aims and gain research independence, I require additional training in: 1) behavioral
science theory for behavioral intervention development and assessment 2) methods for behavioral intervention
development, and 3) advanced behavioral clinical trial analysis. Based on my previous research experience
and success, support from an exceptional mentoring team, strong institutional commitment, and an innovative
research plan, I am well-positioned to become an independent clinical investigator focused on HIV and STI
prevention and treatment in resource limited settings."

Single-molecule measurements of DNA and RNA, and their interactions and processing have revealed how
these molecules function and how their activities are regulated. Our previous mechanistic studies of DNA
unwinding enzymes and CRISPR enzymes have motivated us to develop novel biotechnological tools applicable
in vitro and in living cells. We have also adopted next generation sequencing to develop high throughput
biophysical assays for measuring DNA mechanics and chromatin remodeling activities in a massively parallel
scale. We propose to pursue three broad areas of CRISPR-Cas9, chromatin remodeling, and DNA mismatch
and its repair. A permeating theme is to explore the rich sequence space that is often poorly sampled in
mechanistic studies.
For effective genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) need to be
assembled in high concentrations, requiring accurate co-transcriptional folding of the guide RNA and its
stabilization by Cas9 binding. In addition, after target DNA cleavage, a Cas9-RNP needs to dissociate rapidly for
the cell to detect the lesion and mount a DNA damage response. Understanding how these two critical steps are
modulated by the target sequence will help researchers optimize target site selection and guide RNA design.
Chromatin remodelers are ATPases that changes the position or composition of nucleosomes through
nucleosome sliding or histone exchange, respectively. Many pioneering studies, including those using single-
molecule methods, have revealed the fine details of the sliding reaction, but our knowledge of the histone
exchange reaction is much more limited. We propose to develop single-molecule assays to fully define the
kinetics and pathways of SWR1-catalyzed exchange of H2A-H2B dimer for H2A.Z-H2B dimer. We will also
discover and characterize yeast native genomic sequences that allow nucleosome formation at a sharply defined
location, which we hope will replace the artificial nucleosome positioning sequence, `601', that has been used in
almost all mechanistic studies involving nucleosomes.
DNA mismatch repair is carried out by conserved protein machinery but despite the decades of research, we
have a very limited understanding of how different mismatches under different sequence contexts are repaired.
For example, most mechanistic studies have been performed on a single type of mismatch (GT mismatch). We
will develop a high throughput method to measure the in vivo mismatch repair efficiencies of thousands of
different mismatches. If unrepaired until histone deposition on a nascent DNA, a mismatch will become part of a
nucleosome. We will study the biophysical properties of a mismatch-containing nucleosome and its interplay with
chromatin remodelers, allowing us to examine how an unrepaired mismatch can influence DNA accessibility."

 Anorexia nervosa is the deadliest psychological disorder with an estimated 10% lifetime disease mortality
rate, while over 1/3 of all cancer patients will die from disease-based anorexia, not the cancer itself. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, over 2/3 of US adults are overweight or obese, and this number, as well as the
rates of associated comorbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, is only expected to increase in
the coming years. Despite the opposite directionality of these eating disorders, dysfunctional eating in obesity
and anorexia is mediated by common appetite circuitry in the central nervous system (CNS). Numerous studies
have documented a coordinated and complex pattern of changes in multiple gene products in these appetite
centers following periods of excessive or inadequate eating. These observations strongly suggest that the
behavioral decision to eat excessively or inadequately is likely driven by a multitargeted, maladaptive genetic
reprogramming process in CNS appetite centers. Thus, a core question is what global process could coordinate
such changes in multiple gene products? My published studies have demonstrated that appetite changes align
with changes in alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the hypothalamus. APA is a rapid, activity-dependent RNA
processing mechanism that regulates mRNA transcript stability, maturation, and localization. I identified a
significant APA pattern change on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (Timp2), a gene previously implicated
in the development of an obese phenotype. Thus, I am exploring the hypothesis that Timp2 APA in the arcuate
nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus meters the development of obesity. My proposed experiments in the F99
phase will show that 1) Timp2 mRNA is necessary for appetite control in the ARC, and that 2) APA regulation of
ARC Timp2 is necessary to counteract hyperphagia and obesity. These studies will be the first to functionally
link APA regulation to feeding behavior and will serve as the basis of further genome to behavioral phenome
studies in my independent career. My Sponsor, Dr. Gary Wayman, and Co-Sponsors, Drs. Suzanne Appleyard
and Emily Qualls-Creekmore, are established neuroscientists at Washington State University with expertise in
molecular neuroscience (Wayman) and ingestive behavior (Appleyard and Qualls-Creekmore). My proposed
Research and Training plan will strengthen my theoretical and technical understanding of neurogenetics. In the
pre-doctoral F99 phase, I will learn shRNA and CRISPR/SaCas9 vector design and validation strategies, cell
culture techniques, stereotaxic surgeries, and advanced metabolic analyses. In the postdoctoral K00 phase, I
will build upon these skills and learn to use genetic mouse models, multi-omics, advanced bioinformatics, and
AI computational models to map genome to phenome regulation. Overall, the proposed training will optimally
position me to start an independent research career at a leading neuroscience research institute and advance
our understanding of RNA regulation as a functional link between the genome and the behavioral phenome."
10888211,"Project Description
Tobacco remains the single leading preventable cause of death in the US and annual tobacco-related
health care costs are estimated at $170 billion. In 2016, 20% of high school students (3.05 million
youth) reported recent use of tobacco products and estimated 5.6 million youth under the age of 18
will die early due to smoking-related illness demonstrating a need for prevention interventions.
According to the CDC, some 13.1% of adults aged 18-24 were smokers, and over 5 million of these
young adults will die early due to smoking-related illness. Moreover, the significant declines in youth
cigarette smoking may be eclipsed by other tobacco products and use of JUUL, a highly-effective
nicotine delivery product. Given their widespread use, there is a need to leverage digital media to
influence health outcomes and public education campaigns are increasingly using them. Recent
studies show that social media can be effective in countering tobacco industry product promotion
online and as a tobacco control campaign platform. However, there is little published data on
exposure to and evaluations of large-scale, online tobacco control campaigns. The proposed R01
project addresses this gap and builds on over 16 years of collaboration among the research team in
evaluating the national Truth campaign. This application is significant for several reasons. First,
tobacco use prevention and other health behavior change campaigns are increasingly delivered
through digital channels, yet few studies have focused on rigorous measurement of digital message
exposure and response. Exposure measures are a critical component since analyses either compare
those exposed to the unexposed, or examine a dose-response curve among varying levels of campaign
exposure. This research will use pixel tracking (HTML codes embedded in digital ads) to measure
campaign dose-response effects. While the predictive value of self-report and exogenous mass media
measures of exposure (e.g., GRPs) has been well studied, there is little evidence on the effects of
digital exposure. Finally, little is known about the independent effects of varying levels of digital
message exposure to promote anti-tobacco attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors among youth and young
adults. In aim 1, we will conduct a 6-month controlled, online, randomized study to compare the
effects of varying levels of digital media exposure, measured by pixel tracking, on campaign-targeted
tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavioral outcomes. In aim 2, we will conduct a
field-based randomized trial to evaluate a truth digital campaign to confirm the relationship between
digital media exposure, message awareness, and tobacco-related outcomes over 36 months. The result
of these studies will be benchmark methods and measures of digital ad exposure that have wide
application to future digital health campaigns."

 Program Standards (AFRPS) Project (U18)
PAR-20-132
 Colorado Department of Agriculture
Inspection & Consumer Services Division
 CDA-ICS Animal Feed Program
Project Summary/Abstract
The Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) is committed to maintaining the
implementation of the FDA’s Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) as part of
the critical elements of creating a national, fully integrated feed safety system. The CDA
currently has two FDA feed inspection contracts (Medicated Feed and BSE/Feed Safety) in
place and we have nine (9) staff members that are FDA-credentialed inspectors. The Animal
Feed Program (“the Feed Program”) is an organizational unit within the CDA’s Inspection &
Consumer Services Division (“the Division”).
The Feed Program is applying for FDA funding under this cooperative agreement to enhance
our program by maintaining the implementation of the Animal Feed Regulatory Program
Standards (AFRPS). This will be accomplished through assessment and revision of current
procedures and policies, providing training to the inspection staff, and evaluating the
adoption of 21 CFR 507. The Feed Program will also support the CDA Biochemistry laboratory
through the collection of samples under the Flexible Funding Model. Funding from this grant
will also allow CDA staff to contribute to the continuous improvement of the AFRPS through
attendance at annual face-to-face meetings, active participation in committees, and other
initiatives supporting the AFRPS.
The Feed Program has completed the implementation of the AFRPS standards. The cost of
maintaining the implementation of the AFRPS is burdensome and consumes funds from the
Feed Program licensing and tonnage fees that would otherwise go into feed sampling and
testing. CDA is enthusiastic about this opportunity for FDA support to off-set some of these
costs and enhance our feed inspection program.
A significant challenge to the Feed Program is finding dedicated time and resources to
maintain program standards while at the same time meeting the day-to-day workload
demands of the program. Receiving this cooperative agreement would provide additional
resources, specifically in areas of training, auditing, and assessing and revising policies and
procedures. Currently, the Feed Program does not have enough staff focused solely on
making these improvements. This grant would provide additional focused resources for
maintenance of the standards.
Another significant challenge for the Feed Program is in providing the travel funds necessary
to send inspectors to training. This cooperative agreement would significantly increase our
ability to develop an inspection staff trained in the Standard 2 curriculum, as well as PCs
and CGMPs."

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a major public health problem that affects ~30 million US adults, with increased
morbidity and premature mortality. KOA has been identified as one of the biggest unmet medical needs
because there are no FDA-approved treatments available to prevent, slow or halt OA progression.
Development and evaluation of potential OA treatments has been hampered in part by KOA typically being a
slowly progressive disease, though progression is variable and some knees undergo rapid structural or clinical
progression.
Feasible high-throughput methods are needed to gain insights as to how to identify rapid progressors. We
have developed a rapid, reproducible, and responsive quantitative software tool, Quantitative Radiographic
Software Scores (QROS), to measure minimal joint space width (JSW), fixed JSW (fJSW), variance of 14
fJSW locations; degrees of knee alignment/ malalignment; and orientation and roughness of trabecular bone
texture (TBT).
The overarching goal of our research is to identify knees at high risk of rapid progression, and our core concept
is that quantitative assessment of a novel combination of baseline structural features on radiographs will
identify a group of knees with rapid structural and/or clinical progression in KOA. Our central hypothesis is that
abnormalities of structural features on knee radiographs will be determinants of varying combinations of
worsening rates of structural and/or clinical progression in KOA. Our approach takes advantage of a unique
opportunity to innovatively assess radiographic features on ~10,500 individuals by combining three of the
largest and most racially diverse longitudinal observational studies of individuals with or at risk of developing
KOA: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (JoCoOA), the MulticenterOsteoarthritis Study (MOST), and
the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). All three cohorts have fixed flexion, weightbearing knee radiographs that
were acquired with identical protocols over multiple visits, and comparable data on demographics, KOA risk
factors, and WOMAC pain and function.
Our specific aims are: 1). To quantitatively assess structural and clinical progression of KOA, separately and
combined; 2). To identify the structural determinants of rapid KOA progression; and 3). To determine the knee-
specific probability and time to knee replacement (KR) based on structural and clinical determinants."

In the course of our profiling for non-coding RNAs in fibroids we discovered highly aberrant overexpression of
Tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO2) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in fibroids. We confirmed this
finding by both qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, and found a consistently elevated expression of TDO2 and
more variable overexpression of IDO1 in our tissue specimens. The increment in TDO2 expression in fibroids
was higher as compared to IDO1, and the expression of IDO2 was barely detected. Relevant to the pathogenesis
of fibroids was that the increment in TDO2 but not IDO1 was race dependent, with the increment being
significantly higher in African Americans as compared with Caucasians. Furthermore, the expression of TDO2
was significantly increased in MED12 mutation bearing leiomyomas, and its inhibition by pharmacologic blockade
in vitro led to decreased proliferation and expression of genes related to extracellular matrix, inflammation and
cell growth in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells (LSMC) spheroids. Aberrant expression of these enzymes in
fibroids resulted in increased levels of kynurenine (Kyn), a metabolic byproduct of tryptophan degradation and a
known endogenous ligand for Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Based on this preliminary data we hypothesized
that dysregulation of Trp metabolism as characterized by marked overexpression of TDO2 is
fundamental to the pathogenesis of fibroids and correction of Trp metabolic dysregulation by inhibition
of TDO2 and normalization of kynurenine levels will inhibit fibroid growth and progression and
potentially tumor establishment. We propose to this hypothesis in 3 aims. In aim1 we will characterize Trp
metabolism in myometrium and fibroid tumors and explants, and determine the mechanism(s) underlying the
marked overexpression of TDO2 in fibroids using an in vitro approach. In Aim 2 we will examine the impact of
kynurenine and its activation of AhR on downstream genes regulating extracellular matrix (ECM), inflammation
and cell proliferation. Aim 3 is designed to determine the utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of TDO2 and with
lentivirus bearing shRNA to knock down TDO2 on fibroid establishment and progression in in vivo mouse models
of fibroids. This novel metabolic mechanism for fibroid pathogenesis has great translational significance as it
opens the way for novel therapies aimed at correction of tryptophan metabolism in fibroids."

This application is for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled, “The impact
of tissue resident memory T cells on chronic rejection after lung transplantation”, submitted by Dr. Mark
Snyder, an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Immunology within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and
Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, and member of the Starzl Transplantation Institute. The
short-term goals outlined in this submission are designed to help the applicant achieve his long-term objective
of becoming an independent investigator and leader in the field of human lung immunology research. These
short-term goals include (1) advancing knowledge base related to both adaptive and innate immunity, (2)
expansion of both technical and analytic tools required to effectively perform translational immunology
research, and (3) development of leadership skills required to run a productive human immunology laboratory.
The central objective of this research proposal is to investigate the impact of allograft tissue resident memory T
cell (TRM) persistence and generation on the risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, the major
phenotypic presentation of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD affects up to 50% of lung
transplant survivors by 5 years after transplantation and is associated with early mortality and substantial
morbidity. The mechanism of CLAD remains undefined but is believed to be a T cell-mediated process.
Antecedent acute cellular rejection (ACR) and infection, both T cell mediated processes, are associated with
the ultimate development of CLAD. The applicant’s prior work, recently published in Science Immunology,
shows that donor TRM persistence and recipient TRM generation within the lung allograft are associated with
both ACR and infections. Furthermore, unpublished preliminary data show a trend towards early development
of CLAD in those patients with rapid allograft population of recipient TRM. With this proposal, the applicant
expands on this prior work with the following specific aims (1) Define the relationship between recipient TRM
generation in the lung allograft and the risk of early CLAD (within 2 years of transplantation), (2) Determine the
alloreactive potential and pathogen specificity of recipient-derived allograft TRM, and (3) Identify the relationship
between T cell receptor (TCR) clonal diversity and gene expression among recipient allograft TRM and CLAD.
The primary hypothesize is that recipient TRM accumulation will be associated with early-onset CLAD and that
recipient TRM will be composed of an expanded population of T cells with high allo-reactive potential. To
accomplish these aims, the applicant will employ his previously published method of isolating donor and
recipient TRM from the bronchoalveolar lavage of lung transplant recipients longitudinally. Cox-proportional
hazard model, adjusting for known confounders will be performed to test the exposure (early proportional
decline in donor TRM compared to recipient TRM) as it relates to our outcome of early CLAD. Mixed lymphocyte
reactions and single-cell TCR sequencing will be performed to determine TRM alloreactivity and clonality."

HIV-1 can proliferate through both the release of cell-free particles (cis-infection) and by cell-to-cell
transmission (trans-infection). Prior studies have shown that HIV-1 trans-infection: (i) is significantly more
eﬃcient than cis-infection; (ii) can efficiently infect resting CD4+ T cells, which are inherently resistant to cis-
infection; and (iii) is largely insensitive to inhibition by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Consequently, HIV-1 trans-
infection is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Direct evidence of HIV-1 trans-
infection in vivo, however, is lacking! Our group was the first to demonstrate that activated B cells express the
C-type lectin DC-SIGN and have the ability to sequester and then efficiently transfer HIV-1 to bystander
CD4+T cells. B cells have a greater capacity to transfer HIV-1 to CD4+ T cells than other antigen presenting
cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. We recently found that B cells, but not immature or
mature DC, also have the unique ability to efficiently trans-infect CD4+ naïve (TN) cells – which do not express
the CCR5 receptor – with R5-tropic HIV-1. Importantly, we have reported that B cells from HIV-infected
nonprogressors (NPs, individuals who control viremia in the absence of ART) do not support HIV-1 trans-
infection of CD4+ T cells. Consistent with these findings, purified CD4+ TN cells isolated from NPs harbor a
very small (or even negligible) reservoir of total HIV-1 DNA, compared to ART-treated progressors. In this R01
application, our overarching hypothesis is that B lymphocyte-mediated cell-to-cell HIV-1 trans-infection
contributes to the establishment and replenishment of the latent viral reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells, in
particular CD4+ TN and T follicular helper cells. We propose to use novel state-of the-art approaches to
investigate this hypothesis, and expect to provide the first evidence that HIV-1 trans-infection plays a key role
in viral pathogenesis."

Clinical islet transplantation (CIT), the infusion of allogeneic islets into the liver, has shown significant promise in
the long-term treatment of Type I diabetes by providing a cell-based means to mimic the normal physiological
response to glucose. While promising, it is dampened by the impaired function and loss of islets following
implantation. This loss is attributed to strong inflammatory and immunological responses to the transplant,
primarily instigated by cell surface proteins and antigens. While polymeric encapsulation has shown strong
potential in murine models, clinical translational of this approach is poor. Insufficient clinical efficacy is attributed
to the significant nutritional deficiencies imposed by standard microencapsulation, as well as immunorecognition
and subsequent innate and adaptive responses to the foreign graft. In this proposal, we seek to shift this standard
encapsulation paradigm by incorporating both innovative nano-scale polymeric coatings and novel
functionalization strategies to distinctly modulate immune responses. With evidence that encapsulation can be
highly synergistic with immunomodulatory agents, we seek to generate bioactive, immunomodulatory coatings
through bio-orthogonal chemistry that serves to not only to mask donor cell surface proteins but also direct the
local immune response towards a tolerogenic phenotype through the generation of a supportive milieu. We
hypothesize that the polymer grafting of islets to express functional handles for the conjugation of
immunomodulatory agents and/or nanoparticles will enhance islet engraftment and functional duration by both
masking host recognition of surface antigens and generating a local immunoregulatory environment to support
the long-term survival of the transplanted islets. To test this hypothesis, immunomodulatory agents will be bio-
orthogonally tethered to nano-scale coatings on the islet surface and screened for their capacity to skew host
immune responses towards tolerogenic phenotypes in vitro and in diabetic murine models (Aim 1). Further, to
generate a supportive graft microenvironment and protective coating, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
nanoparticles will be into nano-scale coatings (Aim 2). Using innovative in vitro screening platforms, ideal
immunomodulatory coatings will be selected, with subsequent validation in diabetic murine models. The design
of effective strategies to combine stable nano-scale coatings with local immunomoduation could significantly
improve the efficacy and long-term stability of islet transplants in the absence of chronic, systemic
immunosuppression."
10888180,"The goal of this project is to disseminate MAPseq and BARseq to the broader neuroscience
community. These are novel methods developed in my laboratory based on high-throughput DNA
sequencing for determining neuronal circuitry. Neurons transmit information to distant brain
regions via long-range axonal projections. In some cases, functionally distinct populations of
neurons are intermingled within a small region. Disruptions of connectivity may underlie many
neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia.
At present, neuroanatomical techniques—particularly those with single neuron resolution—are
expensive and labor intensive. MAPseq and BARseq convert neuroanatomy into a problem of
DNA sequencing, and thereby allow us to exploit the tremendous breakthroughs in next-
generation sequencing throughput. The dissemination of these high-throughput methods for
determining neuronal projections will have important implications for understanding normal
neuronal circuitry, and how this circuitry is disrupted in animal models of neuropsychiatric
disorders like autism and schizophrenia."

This K01 application proposes a ﬁve-year career development and research program focused on determining
how ribosomes are regulated during zymogenic cell (ZC) metaplasia and how this process plays a critical role
in regeneration and tumorigenesis. Candidate: Charles J. Cho, M.D., Ph.D., is an instructor in the Section of
Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). Dr. Cho’s
background includes 14 years of training and practice as a board-certiﬁed gastroenterologist in South Korea,
where he gained extensive experience performing gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. Since completing
his clinical and Ph.D. training, Dr. Cho has worked in the laboratory of Dr. Jason Mills, where he has played a
signiﬁcant role in characterizing paligenosis, a process that diﬀerentiated cells such as ZCs use to reenter the
cell cycle and fuel regeneration. Environment: The Mills Lab at BCM includes dedicated rooms for confocal
microscopy, cell culture, and histology in addition to bench space and private oﬃce space for Dr. Cho. BCM
provides fully supported animal research facilities and 26 core facilities. BCM is also aﬃliated with the Texas
Medical Center, which provides further resources including the NIDDK P30 Digestive Diseases Center and its
additional core facilities that will be used in the proposed work. Research Project: The proposed research is
based on the hypothesis that temporal and spatial regulation of ribosomes is a core component of the ZC injury
response, also known as paligenosis, that results in metaplasia and ultimately, carcinogenesis. Two aims are
proposed to address this hypothesis: 1) Determine the regulatory mechanism of ribosomes required during the
initial catabolic phase of paligenosis; and 2) Determine the role of ribosome biogenesis for cell-cycle reentry
and restorative regeneration. Since ribosome biogenesis, maintenance, and translation in diﬀerentiated cells
has been understudied, particularly in vivo, completion of these aims will create new knowledge of importance
to the emerging concept of paligenosis, which may be applicable to the general response of diﬀerentiated
cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to stress. Career Development Plan and Goals: The members of the
research advisory committee are each world-leading experts in a variety of ﬁelds related to the proposed aims,
from ribosomes and translation to pancreatic carcinogenesis. The mentorship they will provide along with the
protected research time will provide an essential research foundation for Dr. Cho to establish his own indepen-
dent lab with a focus on the ribosome and translation in a generalized diﬀerentiated cell model. The training will
also include participation in a diverse seminar series and national and international meetings that will provide
opportunities to give presentations, interact with visiting outside speakers, and network with people in the gas-
troenterology and ribosome ﬁelds around the world, which is another essential element for Dr. Cho to succeed
in the ribosome ﬁeld. The training provided by this support uniquely positions Dr. Cho to develop an indepen-
dent R01-funded medical research program before transitioning to a principal investigator."

who specializes in Headache and Pain Medicine at the UCLA Goldberg Migraine Program. Her overall career
goal is to focus on managing adult and pediatric headache while leading translational research that will directly
impact her patients’ care. One main career objective is to approach headache and pain research through the
lens of a glial biologist, with a focus on astrocytes. The research proposal elucidates the bi-directional
relationship between sleep and migraine by examining the specific mechanisms by which sleep modulates
migraine pathophysiology. Aim 1 interrogates how both homeostatic and circadian components of sleep impact
acute and chronic migraine using three clinically relevant rodent models of migraine. Aim 2 examines
astrocytic, neuronal, and receptor-specific adenosine signaling to identify a drug-targetable mediator of the
sleep-migraine connection. This tailored proposal builds upon Dr. Nwaobi’s prior experiences in glial biology,
while expanding her skillset to include novel technologies that allow for minimally invasive in vivo monitoring of
brain activity which are broadly applicable to the field of neuroscience. This research proposal will also expand
her expertise in electrophysiology, in vivo fiber photometry, and large data statistical analyses. She will gain
increased research exposure to the fields of headache, sleep, and glial biology. This work lays the foundation
for future studies that will be the topic of subsequent K- and R- funding proposals. Importantly, this career
development plan provides Dr. Nwaobi with world-class mentorship from leading experts in fields of headache
medicine, circadian physiology, and glial biology. This diverse mentorship works to ensure her successful
transition to an independent clinician scientist, foster collaborative research, and maximize the translational
impact of the proposed studies. Overall, the proposed career development and research plan will directly
advance the field of migraine with a focus on targeting drug-modifiable processes, while advancing Dr. Nwaobi
towards research independence as a clinician scientist in headache and pain medicine."

 Early detection and sensitive tracking of cognitive changes related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are
critical for identifying individuals at-risk for decline and assessing treatment response more rapidly. Current
gold standards (e.g., paper and pencil measures administered semi-annually) are insufficient, particularly as
the field has shifted towards prevention at the preclinical stage of AD where cognitive changes are subtle and
where widespread screening at much larger scales is needed. To meet this need, we will leverage web-based
cognitive testing which both offers both scalability and which allows for relatively understudied, but promising
cognitive paradigms to be explored. More specifically, our preliminary data suggests that diminished learning
associated with preclinical AD is observable over several days using a Multi-Day Learning Curve (MDLC) i.e.,
the trajectory of daily learning on the same memory and processing speed tests administered 10 min/day for 7
days on a personal device. Diminished learning curves, collectible with frequent, repeated assessments may
reflect early aberrations in memory consolidation- that is, difficulty transforming temporary, labile memories into
more stable, lasting forms. We will use the Boston Remote Assessment for Neurocognitive Health (BRANCH),
an investigator-developed, non-proprietary, web-based platform, to capture high-resolution MDLC data. We will
capture an initial baseline MDLC (10 min/day over 7 days) and longitudinal MDLCs (10min/day over 7 days
every 6 months) for up to 3 years. In Aim 1, we will develop a summary MDLC score (e.g., accuracy and
reaction time across several MDLC tests, Day 1 performance, “area under” the learning curve) honed to
evidence of AD (i.e., Aβ (PiB) and tau (FTP) deposition on PET imaging) leveraging well-characterized
participants (Imaging Cohort; n=250) who span the continuum from cognitively unimpaired (CU; 65+), to
subjective cognitive decline (SCD; 60+), to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; 55+). Second, to test the
generalizability of this early detection approach, we will replicate findings in a diverse Community Cohort
(n=400; >24% from under-represented groups; 65+) with novel AD plasma biomarkers (e.g., ptau217, Aβ42/40). In
Aim 2, we will determine whether an individual’s initial learning curve (baseline MDLC) is predictive of their
clinical trajectory over years. In Aim 3, we will determine whether change in an individual’s learning curve
(longitudinal MDLCs evaluating new learning every 6 months), can sensitively track AD-related decline.
Ultimately, we seek to provide a rapidly obtainable, repeatable, high-resolution snapshot of clinically
relevant memory declines across the very early AD continuum to facilitate early detection of worrisome
memory changes in the general population and to provide a more sensitive method to monitor
cognitive change."
10884782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting approximately 50 million people
worldwide. Large volumes of clinical evidence have revealed alterations in lipid metabolism emerging in
early stages of the disease. Moreover, a variety of lipid-related genes and peripheral lipid abnormalities
have been identified as significant AD risk modifiers. However, the precise mechanisms by which disrupted
lipid metabolism is initiated, and how it subsequently contributes to AD pathologies, remain elusive. As the
essential building blocks for most lipid species, the homeostasis of fatty acid (FA) is key to the composition
and functionality of brain lipids. While the synthesis, transport and utilization of FAs involve all brain cell
types, the degradation of FAs occurs predominantly in astrocytes via mitochondrial FA β-oxidation (FAO)
and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This unique metabolic feature of astrocytes, along with the early
occurrence of their reactive transformation in AD brains, strongly suggests a vital role of astrocytes in AD-
associated lipid dyshomeostasis and raises the question as to whether and how disrupted astrocytic FA
degradation promotes disease onset and progression. Our recent work demonstrates that loss of FA
degradation by astrocytic mitochondria is sufficient to trigger lipid droplet accumulation and reactive
astrogliosis followed by progressive, AD-resembling neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive
impairment. We further reported that reduced astrocytic FA degradation occurs in early stages of an
amyloidosis model of AD. Research proposed herein will test our hypothesis that β-amyloid (Aβ)-driven
metabolic reprogramming of astrocytes impairs FA degradation and triggers lipid dyshomeostasis and astrocyte
reactivity, which consequently drive or exacerbate proteinopathies (Aβ and tau) and other AD pathologies. We
further hypothesize that enhancing astrocytic FA degradation alleviates these AD hallmarks and cognitive deficit
by restoring brain lipid homeostasis and suppressing detrimental transformation of astrocyte. We will first
determine when, where, and how early amyloid pathology metabolically reprograms astrocytes towards AD-
associated transformation using an amyloidosis model of AD. Utilizing our validated model of astrocytic FA
degradation deficit, we will determine the mechanisms by which impaired astrocytic lipid degradation drives or
exacerbates AD pathologies. Lastly, we will test whether selective enhancement of astrocytic FA degradation
can ameliorate lipid dyshomeostasis, neuroinflammation, AD proteinopathies, and cognitive impairment in both
amyloid and tau models. Projected outcomes from this research will test the early, and potentially central, role
of lipid dysregulation and astrocyte reactivity in driving AD pathologies. Translationally, this research could also
pave the way to novel astrocyte-specific AD therapeutics by sustaining or restoring efficient lipid turnover in
the degenerating brain."
10884783,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this application is to identify novel mechanisms by which antiretroviral antibody responses are
generated. Retroviruses are highly successful pathogens, able to subvert or evade immune responses in most
infected individuals. In some unique cases, the detection of viral infection by the innate immune system results
in the induction of an adaptive immune response able to control viral infection and prevent the development of
disease. This ability to control retroviral replication is most often driven by the specific genetic make-up of the
host. However, investigation of the genetic and immunologic basis for these responses in humans is extremely
difficult; therefore, animal models of retroviral infection are required for the dissection of the requirements for
protective immune responses. To this end, murine models of retroviral infection have provided essential insights
into understanding the molecular mechanisms of anti-retroviral immune responses. In particular, inbred strains
capable of mounting neutralizing antibody responses provide the opportunity to dissect the signaling pathways
underlying these responses. The canonical pathway for antiviral antibody production in mice involves detection
of retroviral RNA in the endosome by the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). TLR7/MyD88
signaling is followed by activation of CD4+ T cells, and IFNγ-mediated stimulation of Ab production by virus-
specific B cells. This is the predominant pathway for the generation of neutralizing responses to a variety of RNA
virus infections, including retroviral infections. We recently identified that some inbred mice inherit an alternative,
TLR7-independent pathway to produce retrovirus-neutralizing antibodies. The studies proposed in this
application will elucidate (1) the genetic mechanisms underlying this unique pathway, and (2) the alternative
innate immune mechanism that stimulates this alternative pathway. The knowledge gained by this investigation
will uncover the basis for a previously unappreciated pathway for antibody production in response to viral
infection. Such insight could greatly aid the development of new animal models of human disease and novel
therapeutic intervention."
10884784,"Summary
There is a dire need for research addressing caregivers of persons with Lewy Body Dementias (LBD), the second
most common cause of dementia. LBD encompasses Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s Disease with
Dementia and accounts for 4 to 15% of dementia cases. Core symptoms of LBD present a distinct profile of
caregiving demands driving high stress: fluctuations in cognition, hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral sleep
disturbances (including acting out dreams). These are compounded by cognitive symptoms of AD and motor
symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, shared by LBD. Caregivers living with a spouse or romantic partner who has
LBD (N = 150 caregivers) will complete a baseline interview and Ecological Momentary Assessment surveys
(EMA; 5 minute surveys) every 3 hours for 4 days. The surveys involve reports of care recipient symptoms,
caregiving tasks and stress, self-efficacy, support and well-being. Caregivers will wear a Fitbit to measure
cardiovascular functions (heart rate) and sleep as indicators of stress reactivity. The care recipient will wear a
FitBit to assess agitation via physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate). Aim 1: Identify associations between care
recipient symptoms, caregiver tasks and stress throughout the day. The Caregiver Stress and Coping Model
addresses caregivers’ stress reactivity (associations between appraisal of stress and well-being). To intervene
effectively for LBD caregivers, we must ascertain which combinations of symptoms and caregiving tasks have
the greatest immediate and cumulative impact on caregiver stress throughout the day. Example hypothesis:
Caregivers will report greater stress when dealing with LBD symptoms than other caregiving demands. Aim 2:
Examine how caregiver stress is associated with mood and cardiovascular stress responses throughout the day.
The Stress Pile Up Model suggests that demands and stress may accumulate throughout the day generating
worse outcomes at the end of the day. Caregivers will sleep more poorly when they report more cumulative
caregiving demands, particularly symptoms unique to LBD. Aim 3: Investigate two possible resilience factors
(efficacy and social support) to buffer LBD care-related stressors on well-being. Based on Self Efficacy Theory,
during periods of the day when caregivers experience greater efficacy, they will appraise caregiving as less
stressful and experience better mood and cardiovascular functioning. LBD caregivers report greater difficulty
obtaining social support than caregivers for other dementias. Social support theories suggest that when
caregivers have respite or social support during the day, they will be less reactive to caregiving stress. LBD is
a highly challenging form of dementia with shared symptoms of other dementias, and unique core symptoms
(e.g., hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations) that may exacerbate caregiver stress. Studies of caregiver stress,
interventions, and services have largely used samples with AD and other dementias. To enhance the well-being
of caregivers for older adults with LBD, we must gather the information necessary to design LBD-tailored
interventions with an understanding of the daily contexts in which symptoms, caregiving, and stress occur."

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequent bedfellows, but IHD as the
leading cause of death in this population is under-diagnosed. Although patients with CKD and post-renal
transplant have the highest risk for IHD, reliable estimation of ischemic burden remains a challenge. Accurate
quantification of ischemic burden is crucial for clinical management because invasive interventions may
worsen kidney function. In patients with CKD, cardiovascular event rates increase significantly with increasing
stage of CKD. Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is attractive due to the absence
of ionizing radiation and its inherent ability to provide high spatial resolution images. But perfusion cardiac MRI
for defining ischemia relies on the first-pass bolus of gadolinium, which has intrinsic technical shortcomings.
Late gadolinium enhancement for viability is also dependent on gadolinium contrast kinetics. Both are less
suitable for patients with CKD. In patients with renal failure, gadolinium-associated nephrogenic systemic
fibrosis may be fatal and more recently, autopsy results in patients with normal kidney function support
gadolinium accumulation in certain organs and tissues. Our goal is to test and validate a non-nephrotoxic,
steady-state cardiac MRI strategy that overcomes many drawbacks of gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI to
detect inducible ischemia and viability. We build upon our collective experience with ferumoxytol-enhanced
MRI and ischemic heart disease. Because ferumoxytol is well-tolerated in patients with renal impairment and
has broad clinical approval for intravenous treatment of iron deficiency anemia, if proven successful, our
steady state stress cardiac MRI approach may also be valuable for other applications."

CD1 autoreactive T cells in human immune mediated skin disease
D. Branch Moody, PI
Human skin contains over ten billion resident T cells that participate in host defense, barrier function and
autoimmune skin disease. For decades, research into T cell autoreactivity has emphasized T cell receptor
(TCR) recognition of MHC-peptide complexes. This R01 program proposes basic research into a different
mechanism involving TCR contact with human CD1a proteins expressed on Langerhans cells and lipid
antigens. Building on prior studies that discovered lipid antigens and showed the molecular basis for their
display by CD1a, we recently discovered an unexpected model whereby T cell receptors directly contact CD1a,
and certain endogenous lipids bound to CD1a inhibit TCR contact. The new mechanism of negative regulation
expands the scope of CD1a function on Langerhans cells and has potentially broad implications for the control
of CD1a autoreactive Th22 T cells in human skin. Using collagen matrices and CD1a tetramers to isolate pure
CD1a autoreactive T cells, we will determine T cell receptor patterns, effector functions and the identities of
antagonist and agonist lipids in disease settings. We will determine the natural functions of lipid blockers by
measuring their production in healthy and diseased skin, as well as in Langerhans cells and related cell types.
We will determine the therapeutic potential of lipid blockers by synthesizing analogs to optimize their T cell
inhibitory properties. Since we now know that contact allergens can function as CD1a presented antigens, we
will test a new model of contact hypersensitivity that involves direct recognition of allergens by lipid specific T
cells. Further, we will test the ability of CD1a blockers to prevent T cell response in vivo in CD1a transgenic
mice and in human skin explants. In contrast to the ~ 5000 MHC I and II allomorphs present in humans, nearly
all humans express the same kind of CD1a proteins. This simplified and relatively uniform T cell system
suggests that lipid antigens, lipid antagonists and T cell receptor patterns discovered here will be applicable to
all people and can therefore be used to develop therapies against autoimmune skin diseases."

Some genes take drastic measures to force their aberrant expression. As an example, the gene cyclin D1
which is not normally present in B-cell lymphocytes is expressed in the blood cancer Mantle Cell Lymphoma
(MCL). MCL is the most aggressive of all B-cell malignancies and a chromosomal translocation event, that
pre-dates the disease, activates the cyclin D1 promoter is the initiating lesion in the transformation of normal
B-cells. Once expressed, the transcribed cyclin D1 message (pre-mRNA) undergoes further processing
which enables it to shorten it's 3'untraslated region (3'UTR) thus increasing the half-life of the transcript.
The expression of cyclin D1 in MCL facilitates a hyper-proliferative phenotype and increases the genetic
instability and chromosomal abnormalities of B-cells. In our prior work we identified a novel fusion gene in
MCL cell lines and patient samples where cyclin D1 is joined to another gene thus resulting in a truncated
3'UTR. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms that drive the shortening of the
3'UTR of cyclin D1 as well as the effects of the cyclin D1 driven chromosomal translocation events. In this
proposal we will determine how the sequences found in the pre-mRNA of cyclin D1 as well as proteins
involved in 3'end processing play a role in optimizing the expression of cyclin D1 in MCL (Aim 1). We will
also systematically identify fusion genes, which result from chromosomal translocation events, using third
generation sequencing technology which allows us to get full length gene transcripts (Aim 2). Although
chromosomal translocations are known to occur with a high degree of frequency in MCL, apart from
serendipity discovery in individual case studies, little effort has been put into identifying fusion genes on a
global scale making this type of research innovative. Furthermore, our study will determine the molecular
basis of abnormal 3'end formation will answer a basic question in the field. This will have a positive impact
by establishing better understanding of disease causing genes are expressed in human cells and will allow
for more effective strategies to detect and treat disease."

Globally, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children 0-14 years of age, with an
estimated 74,000 incident cases each year. Nearly 1,500,000 years of life are lost due to the disease annually;
and because of their large, young populations, the burden of ALL is centered within south, southeast, and east
Asia; the middle east and north Africa; and sub-Saharan Africa. These trends highlight the need for research
addressing risk for ALL in global populations where the need is greatest. Incidence of ALL also shows distinct
patterns by ancestry. In the United States, risk is highest in Latinos, followed by European and Asian/Pacific
Islander children, while African-American children have by far the lowest rates. There is reason to believe these
patterns may be based at least partially on genetics. For instance, incidence of childhood ALL among diaspora
populations in the United States largely recapitulates international patterns of incidence. The germline genetic
architecture of ALL risk revealed to date suggests that ALL has a stronger risk component accounted for by
common polymorphic variants than is found in adult cancers, with genomewide association studies (GWAS)
having identified over 15 common variants associated with B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL, comprising ~85% of
ALL cases), which together describe nearly a 10-fold difference in risk between the lowest and highest ends of
distribution of polygenic risk score. However, these studies have largely examined European genomes. The
Childhood Cancer and Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) is ideally suited to understanding the genomic
architecture of ALL risk in children of many ancestries. CLIC’s collective genomic datasets comprise ~12,000
children with ALL from five continents, making them both the largest and most diverse such datasets worldwide.
Moreover, most of CLIC’s genomic data is embedded within epidemiologic studies, unlike the purely clinical
studies to date. With this resource, which more than doubles the sample size over previous GWAS, we propose
to: 1) estimate heritability of ALL using SNP-based methods in diverse populations including Africans/African-
Americans (AFR), admixed Americans (i.e. Latinos; AMR), East Asians (EAS), Europeans (EUR), Middle
Eastern/North Africans (MENA), South Asians (SAS), and Southeast Asians (SEA); 2) conduct comprehensive
genomewide and local discovery for variants associated with ALL; and 3) create population-specific polygenic
risk scores and examine their relationship to harmonized epidemiologic data within CLIC. At the conclusion of
this study, CLIC will have articulated a far more comprehensive genetic epidemiology of ALL than exists today
in populations that represent most of the children on earth; and, for the first time, will simultaneously consider
non-genetic risk factors. We further will have prioritized candidate variants for functional validation and built a
robust infrastructure for future analyses of CLIC’s genomic datasets."

Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming and toxin-producing anaerobic bacterium. It is the most common cause
of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the etiologic agent of life-threatening pseudomembranous
colitis. Current treatment options of C. difficile infection (CDI) with very few antibiotics are plagued by high
recurrence rates (15-35%). CDI symptoms are mainly caused by toxins TcdA and TcdB. In addition, 5-30% of C.
difficile isolates produce binary toxin (CDT), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates.
Active vaccination provides the attractive opportunity to prevent CDI and recurrence, but no vaccine against CDI
is licensed. Vaccines should target all three toxins and C. difficile cells/spores that transmit the disease and
cause recurrence. The goal of this project is to develop multivalent parenteral/mucosal vaccines that target
three C. difficile toxins and colonization. Specifically: 1) We have demonstrated effective protection of animals
from CDI with a potent immunogen Tcd169FI, which includes immunodominant regions of both TcdA and TcdB.
2) We found that parenteral immunizations with FliCD (a fusion containing C. difficile flagellins FliC and FliD)
effectively protected mice against CDI and significantly decreased C. difficile spores and toxin levels in the feces
after infection. 3) CDT consists of CDTa and CDTb. CDTa is the enzymatic component, and CDTb is the binding
component. The receptor-binding domain 2 (RBD2) of CDTb is critical for host cell toxicity. We found that
parenteral immunizations with RBD2 induced potent immune responses to CDTb and provided mice full
protection against a lethal challenge of CDT. In this R01 project, we will investigate immune responses to
immunizations with combined protein antigens (Tcd169Fl, FliCD, and RBD2) via intramuscular, sublingual, and
intranasal routes or “Protective Immunity Enhanced Salmonella Vaccine (PIESV)” platform expressing these
protein antigens via oral route. We will evaluate protection efficacy of these vaccine candidates in animal models
of CDI and recurrence to select 2 best vaccine candidates for further clinical trial in the next funding period."
10890967,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects 1 in 40 individuals and is complicated in 30-35% by ventricular arrhythmias
that increase risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Such arrhythmias are strongly associated with left ventricular
(LV) myocardial fibrosis, primarily localized to regions physically connected with the prolapsing valve. The
mechanism of such fibrosis is currently unknown and studies are limited by lack of an available model. Most
(80%) of patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and SCD have only mild to moderate MR lacking surgical
indications, a major gap in treatment and clinical guidelines. Recent publications from our group and others link
abnormal mechanics of the papillary muscle (PM) and inferobasal LV with co-localized fibrosis and risk of
arrhythmias. These data support the central hypothesis that MVP causes tension-induced LV fibrosis
leading to arrhythmic events. To test this, we have developed a surgical MVP model in sheep that uniquely
isolates the mechanical stimulus and consistently produced regional fibrosis in six previously normal hearts over
six months. We will probe mechanistic links between altered biomechanics, fibrosis, and arrhythmia in MVP.
Aim 1 hypothesis: MVP-induced forces on the subvalvular apparatus cause regionalized LV fibrosis. Ex
vivo, we confirmed increased systolic forces on the PMs in MVP that will be quantified with MVP in vivo.
Progression of fibrosis will be quantified in this model over 3, 6 and 9 months along with serial longitudinal
advanced parametric CMR imaging as used in patients. Controls will include comparable primary MR without
MVP (no fibrosis in 2 6-month pilots), sham surgery and normal hearts. This aim will link MVP-altered mechanical
forces to LV structural changes as a function of time. Aim 2 hypothesis: Increased stress activates a pro-
fibrogenic molecular switch through mechano-responsive signaling pathways. Our preliminary in vitro data
show that stretch alters purinergic-ATP signaling and increases collagen deposition. In MVP sheep tissues and
stretched cardiac fibroblasts, changes in stressed LV regions and cells will be identified at the single-cell level
that will test this and alternative mechanisms to reveal mechanically-induced cellular and molecular changes. In
sheep, we will compare valve-stressed and remote regions over time with those from normal and MR-only LVs;
and cross-reference changes in existing surgical biopsies from 40 patients with fibrotic and nonfibrotic zones.
This aim will link MVP-increased tension to regional fibrogenesis. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that MVP-
induced fibrosis predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias. In the MVP model and controls, rhythm will be
monitored and PM endocardial electrograms recorded invasively at baseline and with isoproterenol, measuring
repolarization markers of electrical instability and arrhythmic predisposition. This aim will link pathologic and
molecular findings from MVP-induced fibrosis to arrhythmic potential. Impact: These interdisciplinary studies will
identify intersections between mechanical stress and molecular pathways to reveal novel therapeutic targets to
reduce fibrosis and arrythmias and prevent SCD in young and otherwise healthy patients."

 The goal of this proposal is to curate clinically relevant variants in genes associated with the inherited
monogenic diseases autosomal recessive Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA)/early-onset Retinal
Degeneration (eoRD) that cause lifelong blindness beginning in infancy or childhood. More than 30 genes
associated with these phenotypes have been identified and the first gene replacement therapy was approved
for LCA/eoRD associated with RPE65 variants, while clinical trials are currently underway to treat disease
caused by 3 other genes (AIPL1, GUCY2D, and CEP290). Despite these advances, it is still challenging to
make accurate clinical diagnoses and decisions based on current knowledge of variants in LCA/eoRD-
associated genes. A major limitation is the lack of uniform classification criteria optimized for gene-disease
specific features that enable accurate and consistent interpretation of the clinical relevance of variants. To
address this, we have assembled a variant curation expert panel (VCEP) comprised of an international group
of experts with in-depth knowledge in LCA/eoRD genetics and clinical care. Further, we established
collaborative relationships with the clinical domain working group (CDWG) oversight committee and the
Ocular CDWG of the NIH-sponsored Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) for advice and guidance. With this
leadership team, we propose to curate variants in genes associated with LCA/eoRD phenotypes for which
gene therapies are available, or clinical or advanced pre-clinical studies are underway. The proposed project
involves 2 Specific Aims: 1. Complete the approval process for the LCA/eoRD VCEP through 4 steps
(assembling a group of experts for LCA/eoRD variant curation, rule specification for the classification of
variants in LCA/eoRD genes using disease-gene specific characteristic features, pilot testing rules specified
for the curation of variants in LCA/eoRD associated genes, and submitting the rules and pilot results to the
ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Working Group for approval), and 2. Curation of variants in selected
LCA/eoRD genes by implementing the specified rules and submission to ClinVar. All steps will be carried out
with the approval of the ClinGen CDWG oversight committee utilizing a suite of variant curation tools and
protocols developed by ClinGen. The proposed project will lead to the development of variant interpretation
criteria that are in harmony with rules established for other diseases and optimized for LCA/eoRD genes, and
generate a comprehensive resource of LCA/eoRD gene variants with FDA-designated expert level variant
classifications in the ClinVar public database. This information will advance research on LCA/eoRD and
enable accurate, consistent, high quality interpretation of genetic test results, and improve patient care.
Further, the rules specified by the LCA/eoRD VCEP will advance development of rules for other IRDs and
other hereditary diseases."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndromic term encompassing a wide range of insults and pathogenic
responses that lead to a rapid reduction in glomerular filtration. Although we have made significant
progress in our understanding of kidney injury in animal models, far less attention has been focused on
the pathogenesis and treatment of the diverse types of human AKI. The largest barrier in achieving this
knowledge is the limited number of kidney biopsies performed for AKI and the small amount of tissue
obtained from renal biopsy. The Kidney Precision Medicine Project is tackling this complex issue by
recruiting altruistic patients with AKI who are willing to have kidney biopsies in order to advance our
knowledge of human kidney disease. These biopsies are being interrogated using multiple complementary
technologies. We propose to use Imaging Mass Cytometry to help provide a highly detailed, quantitative
cellular map of nearly all cells present in sections from those kidney biopsies, including their differentiation
state and activation of injury and repair pathways. Combined with the cell sequencing, metabolomic, and
proteomic data generated under KPMP guidance, this will provide a substantial increase in our
understanding of human AKI and CKD.
Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) uses a high-resolution laser combined with a mass cytometer to detect the
presence, location and amount of up to 42 different heavy metal conjugated antibodies hybridized to a
tissue section. We have successfully used IMC with a panel of 22 heavy metal conjugated validated
antibodies to identify resident kidney cell populations, infiltrating cell populations, and cell activation and
injury states using archival FFPE human kidney tissue, and developed a machine learning technique
termed Kidney MAPPS to rapidly and accurately identify, quantify and localize ~92% of all cells in those
biopsies. We now propose to increase that validated antibody panel to >30 antibodies that will allow
identification of >95% of cells and improve cell injury and activation state assessment, and to optimize the
IMC and Kidney-MAPPS analysis pipeline to perform 2D and 3D quantitative assessment of cell location,
cell-cell interactions and cellular responses in human AKI and CKD biopsy tissues (SA1). We will
standardize a defined work-flow protocol coupled with rigorous quality control assessment steps at key
points (SA2), and then apply this IMC work-flow to kidney samples provided by KPMP and integrate with
the KPMP Central Hub and consortium members to develop accurate protocols for mapping the
scRNAseq/snRNAseq data, proteomics data and metabolomics data onto the appropriate cells and
locations using Kidney-MAPPS (SA3)."

 This proposal aims to develop ABI-171, a potent and selective inhibitor of the “Dual-specificity tyrosine-
(Y)-phosphorylation Regulated Kinase-1A” (DYRK1A), to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
because of its role in inflammation and phosphorylation of key target protein like Amyloid Precursor Protein
(APP), Presenilin-1 (PS1), and tau.
 AD is a neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by neuronal death and loss of gray matter in the
frontal cortex and hippocampus. Memory loss is a typical symptom of AD and has been linked to the
accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). A compelling body of data points to
hyperphosphorylated tau species as mediators of toxicity in AD; they participate in forming NFTs whose
presence is closely linked with disease progression. According to the β-amyloid cascade hypothesis, the
deposition of insoluble β-amyloid is responsible for neuronal death. Plaques are constituted by β-amyloid
peptides (Aβ) that are generated via the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases.
 DYRK1A is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase for which many proteins are shown as substrate1.
DYRK1A activity may be involved in AD pathogenesis because (1) it is robustly expressed in CNS neurons; (2)
directly attenuate inflammation by targeting Nrf2 and GFAP; (3) DYRK1A phosphorylates APP directly and
increases the secretase-mediated cleavage of APP into Aβ peptides; (4) DYRK1A is a kinase for which tau
serves as a substrate and its presence is associated with increased phosphorylation of tau; (5) DYRK1A selective
inhibitor ABI-171 is efficacious in a pilot 5xFAD efficacy model, an AD animal model. Significantly, DYRK1A
primes tau for additional phosphorylation by GSK3β kinase, which is known to contribute to AD pathogenesis.
(6) DYRK1A phosphorylates PS1 a subunit of γ-secretase, and this phosphorylation event increases γ-secretase
protease activity, further elevating Aβ peptide production. These findings support our hypothesis that inhibition
of DYRK1A activity will be disease-modifying and significantly impact the lives of those with AD.
 Despite a role for DYRK1A in AD pathogenesis, few pharmaceutical industry efforts target the modulation
of this enzyme. Avanti Biosciences is specifically and uniquely focused on discovering negative modulators
selectively of DYRK1A in the brain. This Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) grant will allow us to continue
the work from the original grant 1R44AG056181 and enable us to confirm the efficacy of the drug in the treatment
of AD, study in more detail its mechanism of action, complete the CMC and safety studies that are necessary to
file an IND with the FDA.
 In this grant, four specific aims (SA) are proposed: in SA1 we propose studying the molecule in a chronic
model of AD in which the mechanism of action is explored. In SA2 we investigate the toxicity of the drug and
 determine its therapeutic index. In SA 3 we have the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) activities for
IND-enabling pharmacology/toxicology tests. Finally, in SA4 we have the IND enabling studies, including
toxicology, safety, and genotoxicity studies.
 This proposal will generate all the information needed for filing an IND and move the project to the clinical
trial stage."

Despite dramatic improvements in Breast Cancer (BC) prognosis over the past two decades, major survival
differences after diagnosis persist based on a number of clinical factors and tumor characteristics. However,
even within similar molecular BC subtypes there are differences in survival, supporting that additional factors
should be considered to better predict outcomes after diagnosis. Surprisingly, unlike risk models for first incident
BC, current models for prediction of survival after a BC diagnosis and treatment do not incorporate host germline
genetic variation. In addition, Black women experience a 40% higher mortality rate due to BC compared to their
White counterparts. Further, they have been greatly underrepresented in genomic studies; so future clinical
implementations of new precision medicine solutions based on germline genetic variation may exacerbate
existing health disparities. This proposal aims to produce empirical evidence that will be an essential first step to
improve BC prognosis based on appropriate clinical recommendations targeted to those with the highest risk of
poor outcomes. In Aim 1a, I will investigate if a polygenic risk score (PRS) improves risk prediction of BC
prognosis, over and beyond standard clinical markers and tumor characteristics in the Breast Cancer Family
Registry (BCFR). Aim 1b will utilize the BCFR to examine the impact of adding a PRS to existing BC prognostic
tools such as the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), which incorporates information on tumor size, tumor grade,
and lymph node involvement. In Aim 2a, I will examine if the PRS improves risk prediction for BC prognosis in
the Women’s Circle of Health Follow-Up Study (WCHFS), a longitudinal study of Black BC survivors. Aim 2b will
examine the impact of adding PRS to NPI using data from the WCHFS. My long-term goal is to translate
epidemiologic findings into clinical care through more accurate risk assessment and risk-reducing strategies for
outcomes after a cancer diagnosis. This K22 award will provide me with the necessary training and support to
accomplish the following short-term goals: (1) obtain advanced skills in statistical genetics; (2) training in the
translation of scientific research findings in the clinical context; and (3) professional development including
learning the skills necessary to be a successful independent investigator. To achieve these goals, I have
proposed a detailed career development plan, including taking short courses and workshops, attending national
conferences, meetings with my advisory committee, and obtaining research experience by completing the
proposed research aims. This K22 research will address critical knowledge and clinical translation gaps in
identifying women who are the highest risk for poor BC prognosis. Given the increasing number of BC survivors
and persisting BC survival differences for certain subgroups, this is a timely and important proposal."

Behavioral experiments in humans and primates show that novel visual objects motivate behavior, by capturing
attention and gaze, and promoting learning. Abnormalities in novelty seeking are associated with obsessive
compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression, anhedonia and autism. But despite the importance of novel objects in
our daily life, and the clinical relevance of novelty seeking, we lack an understanding of how primate brain circuits
determine whether an object is novel, and how novelty signals control novelty-seeking. Previous studies reported
that neurons in many brain areas respond differently to novel stimuli versus familiar stimuli. However, novel
stimuli differ from familiar stimuli in many respects. For instance, novel stimuli are unexpected, deviate from
recent experiences, and motivate behavior. Such broad and diverse impact of novelty on behavior not only
highlights that it is critical to understand the neural mechanisms of novelty seeking, but also illustrates why it has
been challenging to dissociate novelty signals from other types of neural signals, and therefore why it has been
difficult to isolate how circuits utilize novelty to control motivated behavior. The hypotheses of the Aims are that
(i) object novelty controls novelty seeking through a newly discovered anterior ventral medial temporal cortex
(AVMTC) to zona incerta circuit, and (ii) single AVMTC neurons acquire novelty selectivity through a
quantitatively definable algorithm that considers object recency and object unexpectedness to mediate novelty-
related behaviors. Aim 1 will uncover the neural mechanisms that control motivated behavior to explore novel
objects. We devised a new behavioral paradigm that measures monkeys’ eagerness to experience novel objects.
Preliminary neurophysiological and causal experiments suggest that an understudied subthalamic region, the
zona incerta (ZI), controls the motivation to seek and explore novel visual objects, and that this ZI function is
distinct from other types of primary reward- and intrinsic- motivated behaviors, such as from the drive to obtain
information about uncertain rewards. These assertions will be fully tested by contrasting the novelty functions of
ZI with the habenula-dopamine pathway. We will also study how this circuit controls novelty seeking when novelty
has extrinsic values (e.g., good or bad) and must be integrated into object valuation. Aim 2 will determine the
mechanisms through which novelty responses arise in a wide range of primate brain circuits by recording single
neurons’ activity across temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortices with semi chronic
high channel count arrays while monkeys participate in a behavioral procedure that will (i) assess the
underpinnings of single neurons’ object novelty responses, and will (ii) dissociate novelty responses from signed
and unsigned subjective-value and prediction errors. These Aims offer an unprecedented opportunity to
understand how the brain mediates the curiosity to approach and explore novel objects, which is a fundamental
form of intrinsic motivated behavior that is particularly prominent in primates, and that is dysregulated in many
disorders of cognition and mood."

Older adults living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, marked by poor physical, social, and economic conditions,
are at elevated risk for dementia regardless of their personal sociodemographic characteristics. It is not yet
clear when in the lifespan such risk emerges or through which putative causal mechanisms, if it is indeed
causal. The activities proposed in this application will fill key research gaps in environmental health and
geroscience through first-ever longitudinal studies of neighborhood characteristics and brain aging in midlife,
when it is still possible to intervene to prevent dementia. They will inform the identification of at-risk individuals
and significantly advance the evidence base needed for potential neighborhood-level dementia interventions,
which could leverage public resources outside the healthcare sector and operate without requiring individual
behavior change. Proposed projects will integrate diverse geospatial neighborhood data (housed at Michigan
State University) into the four-decade archives of the Dunedin Study of psychosocial health, development, and
aging among a population-representative New Zealand-based cohort born in 1972 and followed to midlife. The
Dunedin cohort is the only one in the world with fine-grained measures of brain integrity from infancy to midlife,
with the latest assessment (age 45) including brain structural and functional antecedents of dementia. Studies
will determine: (1) whether individuals living in disadvantaged neighborhoods demonstrate signs of accelerated
brain aging by midlife; (2) if specific neighborhood characteristics are uniquely associated with midlife brain-
health deficits; and (3) whether pro-degenerative health behaviors and conditions (e.g., low physical activity,
hypertension, etc.) and are more common in disadvantaged settings and thus may act as causal meditators.
The applicant’s career goal is to become a clinical neuropsychologist and independent academic researcher
who conducts public health-oriented research on the degenerative consequences of environmental exposures
in the hopes of identifying modifiable risk factors and unique interventions to lower the global burden of brain
disease. This fellowship will leverage a multi-university training plan to significantly advance the applicant’s
career by allowing him to: (1) enter a PI-role in the Dunedin Study; (2) gain additional training to advance his
unique research goals, including in established and cutting-edge methods in geospatial analysis, neurotoxicant
assessment, and premorbid modeling of brain aging and dementia; and (3) prepare for an innovative career
bridging environmental health and psychology with job-readiness skills in teaching, mentoring, and grant
writing and management. Mentored training will occur in psychiatric, geospatial, and environmental
epidemiology labs at Duke, Michigan State, and Harvard, supplemented by coursework, workshops, and
conferences. The fellowship will ensure the applicant's move to independence for a unique body of work
investigating environmental contributions to pathological brain aging, with future steps involving additional data
linkage and assessment in older and younger cohorts and at the next assessment phase of the Dunedin Study."

 Several cardiac diseases involve the progressive or acute loss of cardiomyocytes, which are replaced by
fibrotic tissue. Cardiac fibrosis is one of the leading factors in the pathology of heart failure, a progressive disease
that affects millions of people every year. Despite its recognized importance, there are no effective therapies to
prevent the progression of cardiac fibrosis. Recent findings suggest that naturally occurring genetic variants
protect certain individuals against the adverse changes triggered after cardiac injury, which translates into re-
duced cardiac fibrosis. One of the genes that modifies the progression of disease is the cardiomyocyte-specific
kinase Tnni3k. Mutations that abolish Tnni3k confer resistance to injury, and high Tnni3k levels are associated
with rapid functional decline and pathological remodeling. Tnni3k is an understudied kinase, and its downstream
targets and specific mechanisms by which it defines injury outcome are unknown. Our goal in this project is to
identify the mechanisms linking Tnni3k levels to cardiac fibrosis. In preliminary experiments using the zebrafish
as a model, we found that high levels of Tnni3k induce fibrosis deposition shortly after cardiac injury. In contrast
to their wild-type siblings, animals overexpressing Tnni3k showed impaired fibrotic regression, while a newly
generated tnni3k mutant exhibits minimal fibrosis after injury. Transcriptional profiling revealed that high levels
of Tnni3k correlate with an exacerbated inflammatory response, markers of T-cell infiltration, and activation of
all the components of the inflammasome, which are all landmarks of cardiomyocyte-induced inflammation. We
also identified a potential downstream target, itih5, which has been previously reported to play a role in extracel-
lular matrix stabilization in the skin. Based on our preliminary results, our central hypothesis is that Tnni3k
plays a previously unappreciated role in cardiac fibrosis via modulation of inflammation, and that Itih5 is a central
mediator of these effects. We will test our hypothesis in three integrative aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the
role of inflammation in the development of fibrosis in response to high levels of Tnni3k. We will exploit a collection
of immunocompromised zebrafish to test the contribution of specific immune populations to this excessive fibrotic
response. Additionally, we will use a new cardiomyocyte specific Cas9 line to identify genes required for trigger-
ing inflammation in response to high Tnni3k levels. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of modulating Tnni3k
levels pre- and post-injury on cardiac fibrosis and inflammation. We will use a new Tnni3kSWITCH line generated
by our lab that will allow us to “turn off” the overexpression of Tnni3k at different times. In Aim 3, we will identify
molecular regulators of scar remodeling downstream of Tnni3k. We will start by analyzing how Itih5 regulates
fibrosis regression using new gain and loss of function models generated by our laboratory for this application.
Collectively, these studies will establish Tnni3k and Itih5 as regulators of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in
zebrafish. We anticipate that this basic knowledge will serve as the springboard for rapid discovery of new targets
to treat cardiac fibrosis in the injured heart."

propose to use prospectively collected bio-specimens from this cohort to examine the role of the
immune system in acute pancreatitis and its relationship to the development of diabetes. Third, we
propose to look at hormonal changes associated with post-pancreatitis diabetes (PPDM) as well as
the potential relationship between PPDM and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The opportunity to
pursue these investigations in collaboration with other centers as a Consortium is an exciting novel
opportunity to study acute pancreatitis and its relationship with type 1 diabetes."

The physical laws that govern the universe also govern the healthy functioning of living tissues, as well as the
genesis and development of diseases. Historically, the biomedical research community has overlooked the role
of mechanics in many developmental, pathological, and adaptive processes. In my research group, the Compu-
tational Mechanics of Morphology at Notre Dame (CoMMaND Lab), we work at the intersection of mechanics,
computation, and biology, to investigate the coupled bio-mechanical behaviors of tissues and organs, particularly
during growth and remodeling. In this proposal, we aim to extend our work to the study of inﬂammatory swelling.
Similarly to growth, inﬂammation and swelling involve local changes in mass (for instance, due to an inﬂux of
cells) which can manifest as changes in volume. While external swelling is often used as an indicator of under-
lying inﬂammation, constraints from surrounding tissue can also restrict swelling and instead result in increases
in pressure. In addition, inﬂammation can drastically change the cellular composition of a tissue. Inﬂammation is
widespread among different tissues, and these sequelae can have important implications for the diagnosis, de-
velopment, and treatment of different diseases. We will developing novel computational models of inﬂammation
and swelling that 1) allow for cell behavior to vary spatially, temporally, and by cell type; 2) account for mechanical
interactions between the swelling tissue and surrounding tissues; and 3) report results in a way that facilitates
calibration, validation, and comparisons with experimental. This work will provide tools for probing small-scale
phenomena beyond large-scale swelling, exploring the effects of individual parameters, and testing hypotheses
regarding the biomechanics of inﬂammation in silico.

10896194,"Elimination of an infectious disease is often a goal of the public health community. Although that goal is rarely
achieved, the tremendous expansion of epidemiological databases provides new opportunities to test
hypotheses concerning elimination with mathematical modeling. Besides improving our scientific
understanding of disease transmission, hypotheses validated through mathematical modeling provide public
health practitioners with a more structured, quantitative assessment of how elimination of specific pathogens
can be achieved. This proposal aims to develop an interconnected set of modeling tools to support elimination
of communicable diseases. A variety of processes used to achieve disease elimination will be considered
including use of mass drug administration to eliminate neglected tropical diseases such as trachoma,
vaccination for preventable diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, and antibiotic stewardship efforts to curtail drug
resistant infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A key theme is the
requirement of subcritical transmission for disease elimination, meaning that the average number of new
infections each case causes is less than one. A major goal is to elucidate the transmission dynamics of
subcritical diseases on the brink of elimination. Transmission heterogeneity may arise from many
mechanisms including super-shedding of certain individuals, pockets of susceptibility such as in a community
with low vaccine uptake, and contact structure in which some individuals have the potential to infect many
others. Simulations of various patterns of disease transmission will be used to develop distinct measurements
of transmission heterogeneity. In addition, new techniques to infer and compensate for observation error will be
developed that integrate data on the observation process, such as the proportion of cases identified
retrospectively via contact tracing programs. Models of transmission dynamics will be used to identify
transmission-hotspots and superspreaders that can jeopardize elimination. People, areas, or events that
have increased transmission potential can maintain endemic disease transmission even though the population-
level average value of R may be less than one. In the first stage of this objective, we will use existing models to
construct a suite of in silico simulations to compare the performance of various scan statistics designed to
detect disease burden beyond what is expected by chance. In the second stage, we will apply these scan
statistics to observational data. Identification of transmission-hotspots and supersreaders permits optimization
of disease elimination strategies. To eliminate disease, it is insufficient to merely identify transmission-
hotspots or superspreading activity. A strategy is needed for suppressing the sites, events, or people that
cause higher levels of transmission. We will use mathematical and computational models for disease
elimination to address 1) the impact of control interventions, 2) the optimal distribution of a limited treatment
supply, and 3) monitoring of treatment efficacy."
10896195,"Traumatic stress disorders affect millions of Americans and cost the U.S. billions of dollars annually. Alcohol use
disorder (AUD) affects ~12% of the world population, contributing to >2.5 million deaths per year in the U.S. and
costing the U.S. $220 billion annually. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) triples the risk for developing AUD.
PTSD and AUD increase mortality in humans by increasing the incidence of chronic disease. PTSD diagnoses
are also associated with higher incidence of chronic pain in humans. Current treatment strategies for PTSD,
AUD and chronic pain are sub-optimal. The goal of the proposed work is to 1) test traumatic stress effects on
the activity of molecularly identified neurons in central amygdala (CeA) that project to reward/aversion and pain
centers and 2) test the role of specific CeA projection cells in mediating stress effects on alcohol reward/aversion
and sensory nociception & pain avoidance.
We will use an established animal model of traumatic stress in which rats are exposed to predator odor (i.e.,
bobcat urine), then indexed for avoidance of the odor-paired context; this model is predicated on the fact that
avoidance is a hallmark symptom of PTSD in humans. Similar to what is seen in humans with traumatic stress
disorders, our published data show that Avoiders exhibit escalation of alcohol drinking and hyperalgesia after
stress. We will use this model to test circuit and molecular mechanisms mediating traumatic stress effects on
behavior. Specific Aim 1 tests the prediction that traumatic stress activates LH-projecting CeA CRFR1+ cells
and inhibits vlPAG-projecting CeA CRFR1+ cells in alcohol-drinking male and female CRFR1:cre rats. Specific
Aim 2 tests the prediction that inhibition of LH-projecting CeA CRFR1+ cells will reverse stress-induced increases
in alcohol self-administration and reductions in alcohol aversion in male and female CRFR1:cre rats. Specific
Aim 3 tests the prediction that activation of vlPAG-projecting CeA CRFR1+ cells will reverse stress-induced
hyperalgesia and increases in pain avoidance in male and female CRFR1:cre rats. We will use brain slice
electrophysiology, anatomical tract-tracing, retrograde neural labeling and molecular biology techniques,
combined with circuit-based and pharmacological approaches to test stress effects on behavior in CRFR1:cre
rats developed by our lab."
10896196,"ABSTRACT: The overarching goal is to identify and enrich donor dendritic cell (DC) populations that reduce
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and improve survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT).
Our proposal is grounded on published findings that the content of donor DC in the bone marrow graft and in the
blood of transplant recipients have significant impact on clinical outcomes, improving survival by decreasing
GvHD-mortality without increasing relapse. Preclinical data from murine BMT model systems also show that
donor plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) from bone marrow but not G-CSF mobilized grafts improve survival by
decreasing the severity of GvHD. The ability of donor pDC to limit GvHD is dependent upon their expression of
chemokine receptors, cytokines, neuropeptides and catabolic enzymes, but it is not known whether the same
DC subset produces all these factors, or whether there are multiple sub-populations of DC, each with different
functions. Another key question is how homing of donor DC to lymphoid and GvHD-target organs regulates T
cell immunity including GvHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GvL). Answering these questions and identifying cost-
effective procedures for collecting grafts containing immune-regulatory DC will facilitate application of these
exciting observations to clinical practice. To progress towards our overall goal, we propose three specific aims:
Aim 1. To identify the phenotype and gene expression profile of the most potent immuno-regulatory
subset of donor DC present in bone marrow and other graft sources. Hypothesis: bone marrow contains
subsets of DC progenitors that secrete immune-regulatory interleukins and chemokines that limit GvHD by
facilitating the generation of donor-derived induced-Treg (iTreg).
Aim 2. To define the mechanism by which donor bone marrow DC progenitors limit GvHD without
affecting the GvL activity of donor T cells. Hypothesis: bone marrow contains a subset of DC progenitors
that limit GvHD by generating iT-reg from naïve donor T cells in GVHD target tissues while GvL is mediated
by donor T cells activated in secondary lymphoid organs.
Aim 3. To define a stem cell mobilization approach that yields an engrafting number of stem cells and
increased numbers of immuno-regulatory DC progenitors Hypothesis: treatment of donors with a short-
course of Flt3-L will increase the numbers of immune-regulatory donor DC and a single injection of plerixafor
will mobilize these DC and hematopoietic stem cells into the blood where they can be collected by apheresis.
Our work to define mechanisms by which DC regulate immunity in allo-BMT will inform broad fields of medicine."
10864686,"SUMMARY
Immuno-oncology studies continue to grow which seek new therapies leveraging immunogenic, non-normal
peptide sequences (neoantigens) arising from tumor-specific alterations at the genomic, transcriptomic or
proteomic level. Non-normal DNA and RNA sequences that may encode neoantigens can be identified from
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and further prioritized by their predicted binding to the class I or II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) as an indicator of immunogenicity. Immunopeptidomic enrichment of the
peptide-MHC complex coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can confirm
the existence of predicted neoantigens as well as other tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) derived from normal
protein sequences, including those with post-translational modifications (PTMs). This powerful approach
requires `immunopeptidogenomic' informatics tools that integrate NGS and MS data analysis. Despite steadily
growing numbers of cancer researchers pursuing these studies, they lack a centralized informatics resource
tailored to these informatics requirements. As a solution, we will develop the immunopeptidogenomic (iPepGen)
informatics resource for immuno-oncology research. iPepGen will leverage the Galaxy bioinformatics
ecosystem, offering cancer researchers accessible workflows to predict neoantigens from NGS data and confirm
their presence from MS-based immunopeptidomics data, including training resources housed in the Galaxy
Training Network to promote community adoption. We will achieve our goals through these Specific Aims: Aim
1: Optimize and harden modular workflows for identifying, prioritizing and curating neoantigen candidates
detected from genomic and/or transcriptomic alterations; Aim 2: Optimize and harden state-of-the-art MS-based
immunopeptidomic analysis modules for identifying and verifying MHC-bound neoantigen and TAA peptides;
Aim 3: Disseminate tested and optimized workflows and engage in training activities to promote community
adoption of the iPepGen resource. Our team brings complementary, world-class expertise necessary for
success in developing the iPepGen resource. PIs Griffin and Jagtap have developed widely used Galaxy-based
multi-omic tools and training materials for cancer research. PI Nesvizhskii is a world-leader in development of
computational tools for quantitative, MS-based proteomic and peptidomic analysis. Development, testing and
optimization of tools, workflows and training materials will be guided by collaboration with cancer researchers
conducting Driving Immuno-oncology Projects (DIPs). The iPepGen resource will offer a critically needed
resource to advance game-changing immunotherapy studies impacting a wide-variety of cancer types."
10868189,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are photosensitive, demonstrating an increased skin
sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) whereby even ambient exposure to sunlight can result in the
development of inflammatory skin lesions. Beyond the skin, however, UVR exposure can also trigger systemic
disease flares, with increased circulating autoantibodies and further injury of end organs. The mechanisms by
which UVR exposure at the skin can lead to flares of systemic autoimmunity are not well understood. Our
long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms that connect photosensitivity with systemic disease flares. Skin
communicates with the immune system via lymphatic vessels which serve both to remove interstitial fluid from
skin and bring antigens and mediators to regulate draining lymph node immune function. Compromised
lymphatic flow results in increased and prolonged skin inflammation and alters the signals that reach the lymph
nodes, resulting in autoantibody generation over the long term. The importance of lymphatic flow in both skin
and lymph node regulation led us to examine lymphatic flow function in SLE. We show evidence of
compromised lymphatic flow in human SLE and multiple mouse models and that improving lymphatic flow in
SLE models reduces skin photosensitivity and draining lymph node plasmablast responses. Our goal with this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic flow regulates draining lymph node immune
responses in lupus-like disease. We show preliminary data that improving lymphatic flow increases lymph
node fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) expression of CCL2, driving the FRC-monocyte-plasmablast axis that
limits plasmablast survival. Improving lymphatic flow also downregulated skin interferon-I (IFN-I)-stimulated
gene expression and upregulated FRC CCL2 was dependent on the NOX2 subunit of NADPH oxidase.
Improving lymphatic flow additionally upregulated FRC expression of IMP2, an RNA binding protein that
detects N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications and stabilizes CCL2 mRNA, and regulatory T cell
accumulation in lymph nodes. These data suggest the following hypothesis: Improving lymphatic flow
reduces IFN-I signaling, upregulating FRC NOX2-mediated reactive oxygen species generation that drives an
IMP2-mediated program of FRC alterations. The resulting FRC CCL2 upregulation modulates monocyte and
regulatory T cell function in lymph nodes, limiting B cell responses. Our aims are to 1) delineate the
relationship between IFN-I and Nox2 in regulating FRC CCL2, 2) Understand the extent of contributions of
IMP2 to lymphatic-driven FRC phenotypic alterations, and 3) understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic-
driven FRC regulation reduces B cell responses. The proposal will help us understand how lymphatic function
contributes to lupus-like disease and delineate mechanisms by which FRCs are regulated and shape lymph
node function, paving the way to better understanding the relationship between photosensitivity and
autoimmunity."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting around 40,000 infants each year.
Due to advances in diagnosis and surgical techniques, for the first time, there are more adults living with CHD
than children in the US. Particularly, CHD survivors are at varied risk for neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive
delays. There is a pressing need to understand the various risk factors driving neurodevelopmental outcome in
this population. During gestation, the placenta develops concomitantly with the heart and is critical to healthy
development of the fetus. Recent evidence has shown that there is increased incidence of placental
abnormalities in fetuses with CHD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe, non-ionizing modality and
provides a unique window of opportunity to non-invasively study the fetal environment, in-utero. This proposal
seeks to elucidate the role of placental impairments, measured using MRI, in determining fetal and postnatal
neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHD. Findings from this proposal will clarify how interactions between cardiac
physiology, impaired placenta and other maternal-fetal risks drive heterogeneity of outcomes in CHD.
This proposal is also designed to provide important scientific training and career development opportunities to
allow Dr. Rajagopalan to advance to an independent career in using non-invasive, imaging-based biomarkers to
enhance diagnosis of prenatal disorders and facilitate fetal therapy and intervention with a goal of improving
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Dr. Rajagopalan’s work, thus far, has focused on developing novel methods –
both fetal MRI techniques and computational techniques to answer both mechanistic and clinically relevant
questions around birth anomalies. This K01 grant will facilitate Dr. Rajagopalan’s transition to an independent
research career by providing her the necessary skills in: (1) cardiac physiology and developmental biology; (2)
advanced MRI acquisition and multi-site study design; and (3) computational modeling that will allow me to
become an independent scientist focused on advancing our understanding of, and ultimately the diagnosis and
management of neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHD. In order to achieve these training goals, Dr. Rajagopalan
has put together a training plan that comprises of didactic training and hands-on practica in developmental
biology, advanced MR acquisition and processing, and clinical, pediatric cardiology. She is supported by her
mentors: Dr. J. Wood M.D., an expert in in modeling hemodynamics in cardiac abnormalities using non-invasive
MRI; Dr. A. Panigrahy M.D., with expertise in early neuroimaging and cardiac-neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Together with the research proposal, the training plan will lay the foundation for Dr. Rajagopalan’s independent
career in improving long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHD survivors."

La Crosse virus (LACV, family Peribunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus) is the leading cause of arboviral
pediatric encephalitis (neuroinvasive LACV disease; NLACVD) in the United States (US) and is endemic in
western North Carolina (WNC) and several mosquito species (primary vector: Aedes triseriatus;
invasive/established: Aedes albopictus and Ae. japonicus) are competent LACV vectors. In NC, most cases
occur in WNC within Southern Appalachia, where primary and invasive vectors are commonly found
peridomestically. The economic wellbeing of these rural counties is generally low; with almost all counties
being classified as Tier 1 (most distressed) or 2, which likely contributes to disparities related to low awareness
of risk, poor adherence to personal protection measures, and limited clinical recognition in the absence of
severe disease. While the total number of cases each year is relatively low, socioeconomic (SE) and public
health burden is substantial and long-lasting. Clinical, developmental, and SE impacts of LACVD/NLACVD will
be examined in an endemic area. We will also examine whether incidence of mosquito vectors is associated
with LACVD/NLACVD incidence. We hypothesize that (a) SE impact of LACVD/NLACVD in rural areas is
significant and not known at hospital discharge, (b) there is a need for community education about risks,
prevention, treatment, and recovery resources, and (c) incidence of vectors is related to LACVD/NLACVD. To
examine these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess acute and persistent
medical, social, and cognitive LACVD/NLACVD impacts. Clinical assessment and survey methods will be
used to assess patient and family perceptions and behaviors related to LACVD/NLACVD. Medical evaluations
will be conducted via chart review (to estimate severity), survivor survey, follow-up (virtual and/or in person)
interviews, and clinical assessment. Aim 2: Determine and quantify economic hardship in
LACVD/NLACVD survivors & families. Interview methods will be used to collect information from
LACVD/NLACVD survivors and family members. Completing this aim will allow us to estimate direct economic
costs such as healthcare (e.g., physical/occupational therapy, mental health counseling, medication),
academic support (e.g., tutoring), and indirect costs (e.g., related travel, missed work, caregiver mental health).
Aim 3: Assess environmental risk factors at LACVD/NLACVD case residences. Laboratory/field methods
will be used related to site assessments (e.g., oviposition sites, land cover) and mosquito collections at case
properties and surrounding areas and/or non-case neighborhoods. This study will fill a gap regarding suffering
of victims and families after illness and will open new possibilities for future research, public education
campaigns, and social/regulatory interventions."
10883426,"Opiates have been widely prescribed for pain management in the US, with a staggering 142 million prescriptions
in 2020 alone. While these drugs effectively relieve pain by interacting with the mu opioid receptor (MOR), their
complex pharmacology has led to concerning side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, and
addiction risks. In fact, opioid overdose has become a leading cause of death in the US, with more than 100,000
reported deaths in 2021. Consequently, there is a growing need to explore alternative treatments for pain and
related conditions. One highly promising therapeutic target is the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), which not only
addresses pain but also offers potential benefits in tackling affective disorders and addiction. This proposal aims
to identify the mechanisms and regulators that control KOR signaling and potentially overcome the limitations
and side effects associated with traditional opioids by targeting novel signal transducers. The KOR signals
through seven Gαi subtypes (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GoA, GoB, Gz, and Ggustducin (Gg)) and two β-arrestins (β-arrestin1
and β-arrestin2). These G proteins consist of Gα, Gβ (Gβ1-5), and Gγ (Gγ1-13) subunits, forming heterotrimer
complexes. Recently, we reported the structures of KOR in complex with four different G protein subtypes (Gi1,
GoA, Gz, and Gg), which shed light on KOR receptor activation and signaling. Each G protein subtype has been
found to play distinct roles in opioid-mediated responses. Functional characterization has also revealed
significant differences among the four G protein subtypes. Moreover, our preliminary studies have identified that
different combinations of Gβ and Gγ subunits can significantly influence the signaling profile of individual Gα
proteins by affecting the stability of the Gα-Gβ-Gγ complex. Additionally, GPCR kinases (GRKs), such as GRK2,
play a crucial role in terminating G protein signaling, promoting receptor internalization, and degradation.
Interestingly, we have discovered that GRK2 not only directly interacts with KOR and phosphorylates it but also
forms a stable complex with Gβ1Gγ2 and KOR, suggesting a previously unknown role of GRKs. Furthermore,
using proximity labeling (APEX) combined with mass spectrometry (MS), we have identified ligand-specific
signaling profiles engaged by specific G protein signaling. These findings indicate that individual signaling events
mediated by different transducers may separately contribute to the therapeutic efficacy and side effects
associated with KOR. Our central hypothesis is that the ligand-specific responses at KOR are determined by
complex, non-traditional signaling networks at the cellular level. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following
studies. Aim 1. Define the role of non-traditional regulators in KOR-G protein signaling. Aim 2. Identify the
molecular determinants of GRK subtype selectivity in KOR signaling. Aim 3. Profile protein-protein interaction
networks in ligand-dependent cellular signaling response of KOR. The goal of these studies will be a more
detailed understanding of the molecular pharmacology of KOR, therefore providing the opportunity for gaining
new insights into the chemical biology of KOR and access to new chemical modulators as opioid alternatives."
10883427,"Summary. Current methods for monitoring kidney function and the effectiveness of renal replacement therapy,
which rely on infrequent, blood-draw measurements of plasma creatinine and urea, are simply inadequate. In
response, here the team that invented electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors, the first high-frequency,
real-time molecular measurement platform able to work in situ in the body, have combined forces with world-
class experts in both aptamer selection and nephrology to advance the measurement of renal function and
uremic solute clearance. To realize this vision, we are pursuing three specific aims. First, our aim-1 goal is the
development of minimally-invasive, subcutaneous EAB sensors as a clinical tool supporting the measurement
of plasma urea and creatinine concentrations, thus adding renal clearance to the list of vital signs that, like pulse
and blood oxygenation, can be monitored unobtrusively and in real time. By providing accurate, real-time
information regarding the rate of change of plasma creatinine, such an advance would accelerate the diagnosis
and treatment of acute kidney injury and enable the immediate assessment of treatment efficacy. By providing
real-time information regarding plasma urea, the proposed technology would likewise enable the high-precision
personalization of renal replacement therapies, which has the potential to improve outcomes, lower costs, and
enhance patient quality of life. In parallel, under aims 2 and 3 we will advance the EAB platform as a research
tool to improve our understanding of uremic toxin clearance. Specifically, in aim 2 we will use the platform to
characterize the clearance of uremic solutes from the blood, brain, and muscles in animal models of uremia. By
improving our understanding of the extent to which the clearance of urea and creatinine from the plasma reflects
their clearance from the solid tissues that are the major sites of uremic toxicity, success in these efforts will
increase the clinical value of both traditional blood-draw/benchtop tests and our proposed real-time monitoring
technology. And in aim 3 we will expand the platform to the measurement of a range of physicochemically and
physiologically diverse uremic toxins, with our goal being to identify markers that, either alone or in conjunction
with urea and creatinine, provide a more complete, more clinically meaningful descriptions of renal function,
uremia, and the efficacy of renal replacement. The successful outcome of this work will be decisive demon-
stration of a powerful new clinical tool for monitoring renal function, kidney failure, and renal replacement, and
two powerful new research tools aimed at improving understanding of the clearance of the toxins underlying
uremia. Together, these advances will significantly enhance the detection, study, monitoring, and treatment all
stages of kidney disease."
10883487,"Project Summary
Recently, we identified the cerebellum as a novel satiation center in the brain. Yet, little is known about the
pathways and circuit mechanisms through which the cerebellum regulates food intake. The major research goal
of this proposal is to define cerebellar à striatal circuits that regulate food intake and better understand the
physiological changes mediated by activity in this circuit. We have recently identified a subset of molecularly and
topographically-distinct neurons in the lateral nucleus of the mouse anterior deep cerebellar nuclei (aDCN-lat)
that are activated by food intake (Low et al., 2021). Our functional assessment of these neurons demonstrates
that activation of aDCN-lat neurons dramatically decreases food intake by reducing meal size without
compensatory changes to metabolic rate. We discovered that activity in aDCN-lat neurons reduces the phasic
dopamine response to additional food, likely curbing the urge to eat by reducing the reward value of additional
food (Low et al., 2021). Based on published and preliminary data, the central hypotheses of this proposal are
that: 1) food- and nutrient-sensing aDCN-lat neurons are polysynaptically linked to the striatum through
subcortical pathways to influence striatal dopamine levels, and these neurons have a unique molecular profile
that changes during obesity; 2) aDCN-lat mediated dopamine changes influence neural activity in a subset of
striatal neurons and regulate affective and motivational desire for food; and, 3) aDCN-striatal circuits and DA
signaling are disrupted in obesity. This proposal will test these hypotheses through three aims. Aim 1 delineates
the pathways through which aDCN-lat neurons can act on striatal dopamine and defines transcript changes in
aDCN-lat neurons of diet-induced obese mice. We will use viral tools (AAVretro and rabies) to determine the
intermediate targets of aDCN-lat neurons (hypothesized to be linked by ventral tegmental area and substantia
nigra) and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to identify changes in transcripts of aDCN-lat neurons in obese mice.
In Aim 2, we will examine the influence of aDCN-mediated changes in striatal DA levels on the neural activity of
specific striatal neuron subtypes (D1R and D2R). These experiments will allow us to examine how cerebellar
activity influences the striatal response to food anticipation, consumption and gastric nutrients. Finally, the
experiments in Aim 3 will assess how diet-induced obesity impacts aDCN-mediated changes in striatal neural
activity at a single cell level, and more importantly test the hypothesis that silencing the DCN leads to an ‘obesity-
like’ pattern of neural activity in the striatum. By defining cerebellar-striatal pathways, how cerebellar activity
controls striatal neuron function, and how this circuitry might be disrupted in obesity, this work will reveal circuit
mechanisms that regulate food reward processing with added translational value of guiding the development of
non-invasive cerebellar stimulation and cell-type specific pharmacological manipulation of striatal neurons for
long-term body weight management."
10881248,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Every year 2.4 million CT scans are performed to evaluate for pulmonary embolism
(PE) in Emergency Departments (ED) in the United States. Approximately one-third of studies are avoidable,
with each scan resulting in unnecessary exposure to radiation and increasing risk for iatrogenic lung cancer
and heart disease. The use of clinical prediction rules to assess pre-test probability before CT reduces testing
by 25% without any missed PEs. Several professional society guidelines recommend their use. However,
providers do not use these tools, or use them incorrectly, in up to 80% of patients. Clinical decision support
(CDS) that incorporates well-validated clinical prediction rules can improve the use of evidence-based
diagnostic testing strategies however impact is often limited by low provider adoption. Integrating insights from
behavioral economics, including nudges, into CDS design is a novel approach to improving adoption of CDS
and evidence-based practices that minimizes negative impacts on clinical workflow and cognitive load. Nudges
are defined as positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions which have a non-forced effect on decision
making. For example, ‘opt-out’ options for organ donation consent led to striking differences in enrollment. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that a CDS tool incorporating a theory-informed “nudge” will address
identified behavioral barriers to use and improve provider adoption of guideline-concordant CT ordering for PE.
Our team developed, pilot tested, and demonstrated preliminary efficacy of a CDS tool + Nudge. The tool
supported PE risk stratification by leveraging a well-validated clinical prediction rule and included a nudge
designed to address identified barriers to adoption. Adoption rates for the CDS tool + Nudge were almost
double the adoption rates for the CDS tool alone. We propose to conduct a large, multisite, hybrid type III trial
to evaluate CDS tool + Nudge. The CDS tool’s innovative technological architecture enables its seamless
implementation across sites. The tool was developed on an electronic health record (EHR)-agnostic web-
based platform, designed for dissemination to work with any EHR using the open communication protocol Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). We will use a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized design across
three health systems and 10 EDs. Specific aims: 1) Examine the impact of the nudge implementation strategy
(CDS tool + Nudge) on adoption of guideline-concordant CT ordering, 2) Determine the impact of the nudge
implementation strategy on identified behavioral barriers to adoption of guideline-concordant CT ordering, and
3) Confirm the clinical effectiveness of guideline-concordant CT ordering across diverse patient populations.
The proposed work is significant in its efforts to enhance health by preventing iatrogenic lung cancer and heart
disease caused by overtesting. It is innovative in its use of state-of-the-art technological methods and
assessment of causal mechanisms of nudge in CDS. Achieving the project’s objectives will advance the
science of implementation in emergency medicine and the application of nudges to provider decision-making."
10880949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The contribution of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to the development
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is critical in atherogenesis. Recent therapeutic advances considerably
reduced the incidence of CVD. Despite the progress of clinical treatments in the past 30 years, for a significant
proportion of statin-treated patients, relatively high residual risk remains, likely associated with persistent
relatively high levels of triglyceride (TG), thus limiting the benefits of these therapies. This underscores the
need for additional new therapies targeting lipid metabolism in CVD prevention and treatment. ASGR1 has
emerged as a new promising target for dyslipidemia to control CVD risk. ASGR1 encodes asialoglycoprotein
receptor type 1, which is mainly expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, where it facilitates the
uptake of circulating glycoproteins. The loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in ASGR1 were found to be
associated with lowering of non-HDL-C levels and a reduced risk of CVD. The beneficial effects of ASGR1
deficiency in lowering TG and TC levels were further demonstrated in mice and pigs. In this project, we
propose to develop a “One-Shot for Cure” to treat hyperlipidemia and CVD by targeting ASGR1 with a base
editing approach delivered via engineered viral-like particles (eVLPs). Specifically, we will develop eVLP-BE-
ASGR1 therapy in a preclinical model species, the New Zealand White rabbits. We will determine the optimal
targeting strategies using in vitro cultured rabbit cells, followed by experiments to determine the optimal
delivery parameters to achieve effective ASGR1 gene knockout in rabbit hepatocytes. We will determine the
efficacy of eVLP-BE-ASGR1 therapy in rabbit atherosclerosis model and establish the long-term safety profile
of eVLP-BE-ASGR1 therapy in rabbits. Utilizing the latest breakthroughs in base editing and non-viral eVLP
technologies, the successful accomplishment of these objectives will yield compelling evidence, enabling the
development of a revolutionary “One-Shot for Cure” therapy aimed at treating hyperlipidemia and CVD through
the precise targeting of ASGR1."

The function of human tissues is dependent upon complex interactions amongst millions of substituent cells.
Tools that can systematically measure transcriptional and epigenetic states of these cells, while also recording
their spatial positions, hold great promise in understanding both normal tissue function and its dysfunction in
disease conditions. In this proposal, we build upon our recent invention of Slide-tags, a single-cell spatial
genomics technology, to enable facile, spatial profiling of millions of cells across surface areas spanning tens of
centimeters. We will extend Slide-tags to measure not only transcription, but also epigenetic states and genome

embedded tissues. The innovations from this project will yield a robust, multiomic spatial platform for the routine
profiling of human tissues at the scale of entire organs."

Metabolic dysfunction is one of the major factors that impact lifespan in all systems. Mitochondrial defects are
known to contribute to tissue dysfunction during aging. Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid oxidation,
and redox metabolism have all been shown to play significant roles in many processes that can help dictate
lifespan. One major factor that can dictate human lifespan and aging is the onset of metabolic syndrome. Over
the past 30 years there has been a dramatic rise in the prevalence of metabolic disease and currently 1/3 of
people world-wide suffer from metabolic syndrome. While genetics, environment, and nutrition play important
roles in metabolic disfunction and lifespan, many recent studies have shown that disruptions in maternal
metabolism can have a profound impact on progeny physiology and aging. While many studies have examined
chromatin state and small RNAs to explain the heritability that maternal metabolism has on progeny disease
these studies, in fact, support the idea that other factors contribute to the heritability of metabolic syndrome.
Unlike sperm, that only contribute DNA to the early embryo, the oocyte provides a complex stockpile of
metabolites, stored nutrients, and mitochondria to the progeny. Our research exploits the Drosophila oogenesis
system as a tool to isolate large amounts of staged oocytes and embryos to conduct in-depth biochemical and
metabolomics studies of the mechanisms that regulate oocyte physiology and metabolism. These tools
combined with the speed and power of Drosophila genetics allow us to identify and characterize biochemical
mechanisms in the oocyte that impact progeny metabolism. In this proposal we will examine how changes in
systemic metabolism in aged mothers impact the reprogramming of progeny physiology and metabolism. In
addition, we will examine whether reprogrammed progeny exhibit alterations to the metabolic shifts that occur
normally during aging. We will test whether insulin-mediated changes in oocyte redox metabolism provides a
signal that reprograms progeny physiology. We will also define the changes in chromatin landscape that underlie
the transcriptional shift we observed in reprogrammed progeny. Our long-term goal is to use these studies to
provide a mechanistic platform to study metabolic reprogramming in other systems, such as mice and
mammalian cell models, and how it impacts progeny physiology and aging. Overall, this proposal challenges
the dogmatic ideas we all have about the heritability of disease and explores the novel concept that
changes in oocyte metabolism can reprogram progeny physiology and metabolism during aging."
10884267,"A hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is intestinal inflammation and impairment of
gut epithelial barrier function. These defects are thought to drive HIV disease progression by allowing
translocation of luminal microbial products into the circulation, which triggers chronic systemic immune
activation and disease progression. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively suppresses viral
replication in the blood, it does not restore homeostasis in the intestine, even after years of treatment. This
contributes to increased morbidity and mortality due to inflammatory non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
such as heart disease and stroke in people with HIV (PWH). Despite the central role of intestinal barrier
function in HIV disease pathogenesis, little is known about the specific mechanisms by which HIV results in
epithelial damage. Studies of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) dysfunction in HIV have relied primarily on
correlative observations based on histology or peripheral biomarkers. Our proposal addresses critical gaps in
knowledge by utilizing intestinal tissue samples from well-characterize cohorts of PWH and HIV-uninfected
individuals, along with novel in vivo mouse and ex vivo human cell models and state-of-the-art technologies to
explore specific mechanisms by which HIV contributes to IEC death in PWH. We hypothesize that HIV-
associated defects in CD8+ T cell fatty acid (FA) metabolism cause them to scavenge lipids from nearby
IEC, which leads to IEC death. This IEC death then results in intestinal barrier disruption. To address these
hypotheses, we are proposing two complementary aims. In Aim 1 we will characterize the in vivo and ex vivo
impact of HIV infection on IEC death in PWH using colon tissue samples obtained by endoscopy to
characterize IEC death and CD8+ T cell phenotypes. We will also utilize novel mini-gut organoid models that
incorporate autologous tissue resident immune cells and in-depth single cell sequencing analysis
leveraging a platform optimized for small sample sizes developed by collaborators at MIT. In Aim 2, we will
determine the mechanisms by which HIV-associated dysregulation of FA metabolism in intestinal CD8+ T
cells disrupts the colonic epithelial barrier. In this aim we will utilize ex vivo human organoid and in vivo murine
models to test the mechanistic role of impaired FA metabolism in CD8+ T cell mediated IEC death and
intestinal barrier dysfunction. This approach will identify specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying
the impact of HIV infection on intestinal barrier function and systemic immune activation. To carry out these
Aims we have assembled a team with combined expertise in HIV disease, mucosal immunology, and GI
pathology, who are well positioned to uncover specific mechanisms that underlie intestinal epithelial dysfunction
in HIV infection. This proposal will address important unknown mechanisms of IEC biology that may help in the
development of new strategies to reverse gut barrier defects in HIV infection."

People with Parkinson disease (PD) frequently develop dementia, which is associated with neocortical
deposition of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in Lewy bodies and referred to as Lewy body dementia (LBD), an
Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementia (ADRD). In addition, neuronal loss and deposition of aggregated α-syn
also occurs in multiple subcortical nuclei including substantia nigra (dopaminergic), nucleus basalis of Meynert
(cholinergic), locus coeruleus (noradrenergic) and dorsal raphe nuclei (serotonergic). Accumulation of α-syn
likely contributes to degeneration of cortical neurons, which may also be affected by widespread Aβ
accumulation that occurs in approximately 55% of PD with dementia cases and widespread tau accumulation
in fewer cases. However, the affected subcortical nuclei project rostrally to thalamic, striatal, limbic and
neocortical regions, and the loss of innervation from these nuclei also may contribute to cognitive impairment in
PD. We developed postmortem tissue analysis methods to quantify pathologic accumulation of α-syn, Aβ and
tau, neuronal degeneration marked by loss of synaptic terminals, and loss of innervating projections from
dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic subcortical neurons. In this project we will collect
autopsies from a longitudinal study of PD participants that measures cognition, neurobehavioral function and
gait. We will sample cerebellar, basal ganglia, limbic and neocortical regions from frozen brain tissue for each
autopsy case and analyze the tissue with the following goals: 1) Determine the relationship between α-syn, Aβ
and tau accumulation, neuronal degeneration, and loss of subcortical projections. 2) Determine whether
pathologic protein accumulation, neuronal degeneration and loss of projections from subcortical nuclei relate to
global cognition and specific cognitive phenotypes, including impaired attention, memory, visuospatial and
executive function. Defining the pathologic substrates for cognitive impairment in PD will provide further
guidance for therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and outcome measures for therapeutic trials in PD."

Most patients with solid tumors do not benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibition, emphasizing the need to
improve immunotherapy. We have demonstrated that the T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME),
characterized by CD8+ T cells and type I/II interferon (IFN) gene expression, is an important cancer
immunotherapy biomarker. Tumor mutational burden may also dictate response with some oncogenic
pathways, such as WNT/β-catenin, known to mediate immune-exclusion and drive the non-T cell-inflamed
TME. Our research group has nominated a core group of molecular targets associated with immune-exclusion
centered at p38 MAPK. p38 is known to regulate macrophages and dendritic cells. However, our data are the
first to describe a tumor cell-intrinsic role for p38 driving the non-T cell-inflamed TME. In this project, we will
investigate tumor cell p38 signaling as a new mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in carcinogen-
associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lacking infection by human papillomavirus
(HPV). Our research aims are to (1) Establish a causal link between p38, non-T cell-inflamed tumors, and
resistance to ICI in HPV- HNSCC (2) Determine the impact of tumor cell p38 MAPK spatial distribution on T cell
infiltration in HPV− HNSCC (3) Validate and uncover co-activated mechanisms with p38 MAPK in HPV−
HNSCC. We will leverage our lab’s unique role at the center of large-scale, multi-omic approaches as well as
field-leading clinical trial and translational investigation. We will utilize 11 independent cohorts of patients with
HPV- HNSCC. From the public domain, we will include RNAseq and image analysis from three cohorts,
scRNAseq from one cohort, as well as cell line, drug sensitivity and FDA-approved drug databases. These
analyses will be augmented for RNAseq, scRNAseq, and multispectral spatial imaging data from seven other
cohorts organized by our team. These will include immunotherapy naïve patients and patients treated on a
clinical trial we are leading of the p38 inhibitor ARRY-614 + nivolumab. We will utilize a combination of the
computational, machine- and deep-learning analyses plus mechanistic murine experiements in four syngeneic
models as well as in vitro validation studies to pursue our research. Our systemic approach has already
nominated further molecular targets for combination approaches with p38 and immunotherapy. We will validate
these and nominate further molecular targets to enhance cancer immunotherapy."
10881570,"During normal embryonic development, wound healing and cancer metastasis, cells move collectively,
making and breaking cell-cell contacts as they squeeze between other cells and tissues. Individual cells can
leave an epithelium by undergoing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. However, the program(s)
enabling cells to escape as a group are less clear. Even less studied are the mechanisms by which groups
of cells establish new connections at their destination. We established an in vivo model, the border cells in
the Drosophila ovary, to study collective cell movements. We deploy the powerful Drosophila genetics toolkit
and organ culture methods we developed to carry out high-resolution live imaging and optogenetics. During
the last funding period, we investigated mechanisms by which border cells separate from the follicular
epithelium in the process of delamination and how they make new connections when they reach the oocyte,
a process we call neolamination. We identified multiple steps of each process and proteins that control them.
In Aim 1, we will address key open questions in the septin field and build on our discoveries that the septin
cytoskeleton is essential for border cell delamination and that the GTPase Rho recruits septins to the cortex.
We propose to use novel in vivo analysis of cell and cluster geometry that we developed to compare and
classify Rho, myosin, and septin phenotypes to clarify their roles and relationships in delamination. We will
identify the GEFs and GAPs that regulate Rho upstream of septins. In Aim 2, we will follow up on our
discovery that the nucleus plays an essential role in collective delamination. As border cells delaminate, they
squeeze into tiny spaces much smaller than even a single nucleus. The nucleus can impede cell movement
through rigid plastic pores, but we found that the nucleus plays a role in promoting border cell delamination.
We propose a new “nuclear wedge” model in which nuclei push substrate cells apart. In Aim 2, we will
decipher the mechanisms that move nuclei within the lead cell to promote its wedge function. We will test the
function of the LIS1/NudE/Dynein pathway, which moves nuclei on microtubules (MTs) during the migration
of neural progenitors in the developing neocortex. We will also study myosin, which transiently accumulates
near sites of nuclear deformation and movement. In Aim 3, we will pursue our discovery that innexin (Inx)
gap junction proteins promote both delamination and neolamination. Inxs function in a MT-dependent but
channel-independent manner. We propose to probe the unexplored relationship between Inxs and MTs. We
recently overcame a major technical hurdle and can now image MT dynamics in vivo, which we will use to
characterize innexin phenotypes. We will decipher the relationship between MT post translational
modifications and dynamics in vivo. We will also test our integrative working model for how nuclear, and
cortical cytoskeletal systems interact to accomplish collective delamination and neolamination in vivo."

This application requests funds for the purchase of an Andor BC43 spinning disc confocal
microscope to empower research and expand capabilities in 11 labs across three departments in
the Colleges of Science and Engineering at San José State University (SJSU). The Andor BC43
complements the functionality of our current Zeiss LSM 700 line-scanning current microscope,
which is over 11 years old, technically outdated, and near the end of its serviceable life as
replacement parts are no longer made. The LSM700 confocal is functionally limited, as it is an
upright microscope, lacks environmental controls, and the line-scanning acquisition rapidly
photobleaches live samples and is too slow to capture dynamic events. The new Andor BC43
overcomes all these limitations and adds new capabilities for visualizing dynamic biological
systems, and will enable imaging of live mammalian cells. All users had the opportunity to test
this instrument during a three-day long demonstration, and imaged both fixed and live samples.
This permitted us to evaluate the performance of the instrument and compare it to our existing
line-scanning confocal microscope, and to confirm that this instrument will increase capacity and
expand the repertoire of experiments that can be performed on our campus. The Andor BC43 will
be housed at SJSU within the Imaging Core Facility of the newly constructed state-of-the-art
Interdisciplinary Science Building. The Andor BC43 microscope will be administrated using the
same training, reservation and recharge systems that have been successful over the past decade
of managing the LSM 700 confocal microscope. Our novel subscription model will guarantee
funds sufficient to continue the service contract beyond the initial period in this proposal, and will
accrue and roll-over to fund future repairs. The Andor BC43 will greatly enhance our biomedical
research capacity by expanding the types of experiments that can be performed by faculty
research labs to now include highly dynamic biological processes in living systems. Additionally,
it will create new educational opportunities for our large population of under-represented minority
(URM) undergraduate and graduate students by supporting active learning strategies in
laboratory-based courses, thus promoting diversification of the STEM work force."

Minimal change disease and primary focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis are morphologic
expressions of a diffuse podocytopathy of to date unknown cause, and all present with acute
onset Nephrotic Syndrome. Although the majority of patients achieve clinical remission, relapse
and treatment failure is common, and when progressing to end stage kidney disease, the disease
frequently and vigorously recurs in the allograft. We recently published a groundbreaking study
that identified circulating autoantibodies against the extracellular domain of nephrin in a subset of
adults and children with non-genetic Minimal Change Disease and in a single patient with
recurrent disease in the allograft, which correlate with disease activity. Our findings underpin the
paradigm-shifting hypothesis that at least a subset of these diseases are mediated by an organ-
specific, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease of B cell origin which causes an acquired diffuse
podocytopathy by means of direct action of the autoantibodies on the podocyte, an essential
component of the kidney filter. The current proposal now aims at proving this concept by 1)
establishing pathogenic autoimmunity in anti-nephrin mediated podocytopathy by means of
analyzing immunophenotypes and immunological signatures, and by 2) identifying direct
downstream pathomechanistic effects by nephrin autoantibodies that cause changes in podocyte
structure and function. Altogether, results from these studies will serve as critical basis for the
development of novel, personalized and targeted treatment strategies for our patients with
minimal change disease, primary focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis as well as those
patients with recurrent disease in the transplant."

 The primary objective of the Pediatric Hematology Research Training Program has been to train individuals –
mostly pediatric hematology/oncology fellows – for academic or industrial careers in pediatric-related, benign
hematology. Pediatric benign hematology is a highly underserved area of research. Our Division, supported by
this T32, has excelled at attracting, training, and retaining young, talented individuals to this field who have risen
to leadership roles in pediatric benign hematology research. In this renewal, we propose to expand the scope of
our T32, increasing our slots from 4 to 6 postdoctoral slots per year to pursue a new, more ambitious vision. The
Specific Aims of this renewal are as follows: (1) This T32 renewal will offer a wide range of research training
opportunities of particular import to pediatrics in hemoglobinopathies and other anemias, hemostasis/
thrombosis, megakaryocyte/platelet biology, transfusion medicine, stem cell development, bone marrow failure,
and now, vasculogenesis. (2) It will support a wide pool of potential trainees. Besides the pediatric
hematology/oncology fellows pool we will include: i. non-hematology pediatric fellows interested in pursuing
research in benign hematology, and ii. candidates from a proposed sickle cell disease (SCD) subspecialty
training program offering state-of-the-art research training related to SCD. (3) Training will continue to involve
a “team” approach of a primary mentor plus advisory faculty with key ancillary skills (e.g., bioinformatics or gene
therapy). (4) The T32 infrastructure will continue to carefully monitor individual trainee progress and
oversee mentorship towards reaching the appropriate next career milestones using a novel “stepwise oversight”
committee designed to transition pediatric hematology/oncology fellows from their clinical year(s) to their early
assistant professor years. (5) Our program will continue to emphasize acquisition of skills critical for
successful academic careers. Preparation of manuscripts, presentations and grant submissions, detailed
bioethical training, laboratory or investigator leadership skills, and specific training in optimizing authentication
of key reagents, in designing the laboratory and/or clinical study, and in rigorous data analysis. Thetraining faculty
is comprised of a closely-knit group of productive, well-funded, pediatric benign hematology physicians and
scientists with strong records as mentors, supplemented by additional trainers that bring in skills key for the
success of our trainees. Our program has been successful in the research training of minority students, and this
effort remains a priority that the proposed inclusion of trainees pursuing a SCD subspecialty fellowship should
further enhance. Despite a national trend away from subspecialty research training in pediatrics, this T32
mechanism has enabled our Program to train outstanding candidates for academic careers to become national
and international leaders in many areas of benign pediatric hematology. We believe that the expanded vision we
propose for our T32 renewal shows the program’s continued vigor, and its ability to evolve and maintain
relevance in our field of benign pediatric hematology."
10884204,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasingly recognized in children, with an incidence approaching
that of adults. Most children with pancreatitis have a single, mild, acute episode that resolves
without complications. However, a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes
(defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis
(CP). Pediatric ARP and CP significantly impact quality of life and carry high healthcare costs.
Few studies have been performed to characterize the natural history pediatric ARP and CP, to
identify its risk factors and to determine predictors of disease course. As INSPPIRE
(INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE), the first multicenter,
multidisciplinary collaboration in pediatric pancreatitis, we determined that children with ARP
harbor multiple genetic risk variants and rapidly transition to CP, exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency (EPI) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The risk factors that predispose children to
early onset pancreatitis, rapid progression to CP and premature loss of exocrine and
endocrine function are not well-known. The objective of this application is to delineate the
natural history of pediatric CP through careful prospective analysis of INSPPIRE-2 cohort, to
define the impact of genetic modifiers on disease course and to determine the mechanisms
involved in pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3cDM). The overall hypothesis is that genetic
factors predispose children to early onset CP, EPI, and DM. Our specific aims are: 1)
Characterize pediatric CP, determine predictors of disease onset and progression; 2) Determine
the impact of genetic variants on disease onset and progression; 3) Identify mechanisms
underlying disturbed glucose regulation in pediatric ARP and CP. This project will provide
insight into the pathophysiology of pediatric pancreatitis, investigate the impact of genetic
variants on disease course and explore the mechanisms of early islet cell dysfunction in
pediatric ARP and CP. Our long-term goal is to develop diagnostic modalities, prognostic factors
and innovative treatment approaches for pediatric ARP and CP."

This proposal brings together leading experts on mental health and HIV service delivery from top US and
Malawian institutions, including the Malawian Ministry of Health (MOH), to evaluate the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of an evidence-based stepped model of depression care integrated into Malawi's
national HIV platform. Malawi has the 9th highest HIV prevalence in the world, and the 2nd lowest GDP per
capita. Additionally, depression is a leading cause of disability but remains untreated in over 90% of cases.
Lack of cost-effective, scalable solutions is a fundamental barrier. Against this backdrop, one major success
has been the scale-up of a network of 709 HIV clinics, with over half a million patients enrolled in ART. As a
chronic care system with dedicated human resources and infrastructure, this presents a strategic platform for
integrating depression care, and responds to a robust evidence base outlining the bi-directionality of
depression and HIV outcomes. Members of the research team have already successfully piloted this model in
a neighboring district, demonstrating feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy. Moreover, the team has
already integrated treatment for other non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes into the
HIV care system of Neno District, Malawi. Additionally, team members have successfully integrated depression
care into HIV services in similar settings (Uganda) and instituted depression care models such as Problem
Solving Therapy (PST) in settings throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to conducting formative work on
depression prevalence, screening and diagnostic tools in Malawi. Building from this, we will evaluate a gold
standard stepped model of depression care that combines group-based PST with antidepressant therapy
(ADT) in n=420 patients with moderate/severe depression (PHQ-9>10), following a stepped wedge cluster
randomized design in which 14 facilities are randomized to implement the model in five steps over a 15-month
period. Primary outcomes (depression symptoms, functional impairment, and overall health) and secondary
outcomes (e.g. HIV: viral load, ART adherence; diabetes: A1C levels; hypertension: systolic blood pressure)
will be measured every three months, inclusive of baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment (3 months), 6- and
12 months follow-up. We will also evaluate the model's suitability for national scale-up from three perspectives:
cost-effectiveness, feasibility and research capacity. Cost-effectiveness will examine direct treatment effects on
depressive symptoms, as well as indirect benefits on (a) comorbid conditions, and (b) burden of care among
household members of participants. Feasibility will be assessed through key informant interviews with n=20
study participants and n=10 providers. Research capacity will be supported through (i) a university course and
field placement instituted in Years 3-5, (ii) a local research mentorship program, and (iii) a training protocol on
the depression care package, inclusive of evaluation tools, for national dissemination launched in Year 5."

 Heart disease and stroke are the No. 1 and 5 causes of deaths in the US. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)
significantly increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes. Intense glycemic control has been reported to
reduce major cardiovascular events by >30%, suggesting that hyperglycemia is one of the major contributors to
T1DM-associated heart attack and stroke risk escalation. However, how T1DM and hyperglycemia exacerbate
such risk is unclear. Platelets are vascular first-responders that activate for hemostasis upon blood vessel
damage; whereas pathogenic platelet activation leads to spurious thrombosis and acute vascular obstruction.
T1DM and hyperglycemia lead to platelet hyperactivity and increased propensity to form thrombi. This proposals
aims to understand how hyperglycemia causes platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis in T1DM, and to develop
new therapeutic strategies to mitigate T1DM-associated heart attacks and strokes. Utilizing an integrated
metabolism toolkit including state-of-the-art Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM), we demonstrated
critical role of altered platelet metabolism in thrombin-induced platelet activation. Specifically, thrombin
stimulation alters platelet metabolism that is centered on glycogen metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP), namely, “the glycogen-PPP-F1,6BP axis”, modulating energy,
redox and calcium homeostasis in platelets and leading to their activation. Literature and our compelling
preliminary data further reveal that hyperglycemia increases glycogen storage and its mobilization that generates
ATP, PPP inhibition, reactive oxygen species, and intracellular calcium, all of which are in line with increased
propensity for platelets to activate. Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that hyperglycemia changes the
glycogen-PPP-F1,6BP axis in platelets to drive platelet hyperactivity and thus thrombotic risk in T1DM. In Aim 1,
we will delineate these hyperglycemia-induced changes in the glycogen-PPP-F1,6BP axis in platelets isolated
from T1DM patients and normal healthy platelets subject to acute hyperglycemia in vitro. In Aim 2, we will
determine how modulation of the glycogen-PPP-F1,6BP axis by pharmacological and genetic means suppresses
hyperglycemia-induced platelet hyperactivity in vitro. In Aim 3, we will determine how modulation of the glycogen-
PPP-F1,6BP axis by pharmacological and genetic means reduces hyperglycemia-exacerbated thrombosis and
stroke in animal models. Our team is in a unique position to address our hypothesis, as we possess recognized
expertise in metabolism and metabolomics (Qingjun Wang PhD and Matthew Gentry PhD), platelet biology
(Sidney Whiteheart PhD), T1DM (Lisa Tannock MD), and stroke (Justin Fraser MD and Jill Roberts PhD), and
we have strong partnership with the University of Kentucky Metabolomics, Redox Metabolism, and Rodent
Surgery Cores. Upon completion of the proposed project, we will have presented a novel mechanism for
metabolic dysregulation in platelets to mediate hyperglycemia-induced platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis in
T1DM, and will have identified new therapeutic targets for mitigating T1DM-associated heart attacks and strokes."

and pancreatic cancer. The PCC is highly integrated at all levels of the CPDPC, including leadership,
participation in Committees and Working Groups, contribution to primary cohorts, several ancillary studies and
publications. PCC has been effective in utilizing the CPDPC infrastructure and resources for high-quality
scientific projects. In the next five years of funding, the PCC is committed to completing ascertainment of the
primary CPDPC cohorts, execution of the currently approved ancillary studies, and participating in new
projects. We will also propose concepts for three new ancillary studies that will utilize the infrastructure and
resources of the CPDPC. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Contribute to completing the acquisition of CPDPC’s
primary cohorts and ongoing ancillary studies. Aim 2. We will propose and support new ancillary projects to
use the infrastructure created with the primary cohorts and ongoing ancillary studies. As part of Aim 2, we

in randomized clinical trials of CP, ii) Identify Urine Biomarkers of Pain (UBP) for mechanism-based
phenotyping of CP pain, and iii) Use a genotying approach to enrich the New Onset Diabetes (NOD) cohort.
Our existing and well-established, efficient and effective clinical and research infrastructure for patient accrual,
sample processing, data management and transfer, and analysis will support the program. The rich clinical
volume, diverse investigator expertise in all critical areas such as pancreatology, epidemiology, early detection
of cancer, genetics, physiology, imaging, endocrinology, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and all relevant
disease subtypes, administrative authority in clinical and research areas ensure continued success. Our track
record of leadership, strong collaborations and working relationships within the CPDPC and other collaborative

Project 2 continues our focus on brain imaging studies in human SLE to investigate mechanisms of cognitive
dysfunction in patients with this disorder. The proposed study leverages the information gained in the last
funding cycle: the presence of consistent elevations in resting metabolic activity (a proxy for local synaptic
function) in the hippocampus of SLE patients, which correlated with anti DNA receptor antibody (DNRAb) titers
and with performance on cognitive test battery. In the next funding cycle, we plan to use multimodal PET and
MRI imaging tools to determine the mechanistic basis for cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. New
experimental evidence from Project 1 implicates microglial (MG) activation in the hippocampal neurotoxic
response to DNRAb. We will therefore use [11C]-PBR28 PET to assess this phenomenon in SLE patients
compared to healthy volunteer subjects. To this end, radiotracer uptake will be quantified in the hippocampus
and other metabolically active SLE-related brain regions. Using a longitudinal design, we will evaluate regional
MG activation over a two-year period, and determine how these changes relate to concurrent assessments of
cognitive functioning, DNRAb titers, and resting metabolic activity measured in the same subjects. Likewise,
we will use a quantitative MRI approach to evaluate BBB permeability in the hippocampus and in the other
SLE-related brain regions. Changes in this measure will similarly be compared with concurrent serological and
cognitive assessments, as well as with the other imaging descriptors of the underlying disease process. The
broad applicability of this approach may be limited, however, by the invasiveness of some of the imaging
methods. To make these assessments more clinically accessible, we will lastly explore the use of newer non-
invasive imaging tools as alternative disease markers. In summary, the multimodal imaging approach in
Project 2 will provide objective metrics for the assessment of new treatment strategies for SLE-CI."

Abstract
We have shown that antibodies cross-reactive with DNA and the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR), termed DNRAbs and present in approximately 30% of patients with Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus, can exit the maternal circulation, enter the fetal circulation and the fetal brain
leading to the death of female fetuses and impaired cognition in male offspring. We now
propose to understand the mechanism of DNRAb-mediated brain injury in female and male
fetuses and whether FcR-mediated mechanisms are involved. We will also determine the
contribution of each of the NMDAR subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, both of which are targets of
DNRAb, to the antibody-mediated damage. Finally, we have demonstrated that some mutations
in the Fc portion of IgG render an antibody unable to cross the placenta and enter the fetal
circulation. We will attach NMDAR subunits or DWEYS peptide to these Fc constructs to create
a decoy antigen that will not cross the placenta in order to develop a strategy to protect the fetus
from maternal DNRAb. This last goal could lead to a generalizable strategy to protect a fetus
from maternal antibody with pathogenic potential."

We are now at a pivotal point of medical and population genetics where available genetic and genomic datasets
are powered to detect diverse signatures of natural selection on the human genome, and to investigate their
downstream effects on the genetic architecture of human diseases and complex traits. Characterizing these
signatures could enable us to improve our understanding of diseases, as well as their prevention, through
improved polygenic risk scores across diverse ancestry groups, and diagnosis, through improved variant
prioritization scores in clinical studies. However, methodological development and new analyses are still required
to make sense of these new disparate datasets.
In this proposal, we will develop models and apply methods aiming at investigate the downstream effects of
natural selection on human diseases by leveraging novel large genetic and genomic datasets. First, we will
characterize the genetic signatures of natural selection shaping the genetic architecture of human complex traits,
by leveraging polygenic methods, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics for a hundred
of traits, and evolutionary simulations. Indeed, while many works have recently highlighted the action of negative
selection on human diseases, we still need methods to analyze low-prevalence diseases and to investigate
selection beyond the action of negative selection. Second, we will characterize the genetic signatures of recent
selection leading to different gene regulation and allele effect sizes across diverse ancestry groups by leveraging
single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS datasets from European and Asian ancestries. Developing methods to analyze
and interpret the recently released non-European genomic and genetic datasets has the premise to understand
recent human adaptation, and why allele effect sizes from GWAS differ across ancestry groups, which is
fundamental to improve polygenic risk scores transportability. Third, we will characterize the genetic signatures
of natural selection on genes at the exon and regulatory levels over millions of years of evolution by leveraging
sequencing data from 240 mammals and recent enhancer-gene maps. Including the base pair resolution of
constraint datasets to exon and regulatory scores will allow to improve our knowledge of gene evolution and
function, and ultimately the interpretation of rare genetic variants in diagnostic studies. Our methods and datasets
will be publicly available, deeply documented, and applicable to any heritable traits, maximizing their impact to
the community."

comparable mechanism. Our long-term goal is to establish a complete mechanistic framework of class-I viral

generating specific models that fit within the general framework. HA resides on the surface of the IAV virion and
facilitates attachment to the target cell surface through the receptor-binding domain (HA1) engaging SA moieties.
Following endocytosis and trafficking to the late endosome, HA promotes fusion of the viral and endosomal
membranes. The model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a “spring-loaded” metastable prefusion
conformation at neutral pH. Dissociation of HA1 from the fusion domain (HA2) allows HA2 to undergo a cascade
of conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. While extensive structural data exist for HA pre- and
postfusion, and alternative conformations have been visualized and inferred, the conformational trajectory that
leads to membrane fusion, including the adoption of anticipated intermediates, has never been explicitly
validated. Nor has the order and timing of conformational changes and membrane fusion been determined. Here,
we will utilize a multifaceted approach involving single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer imaging,
single-virion fusion, cryoelectron tomography, and molecular dynamic simulation to directly visualize the
conformational trajectory undergone by HA during membrane fusion. We will explore the roles of virion
morphology, HA density and cooperativity, and target membrane lipid content in mediating HA conformational
changes and the mechanism of fusion. We will describe the allosteric connection between distal regions of HA
that regulate the timing of fusion, drawing comparison to SARS-CoV-2 S. Finally, we will biophysically
characterize the phenotypic differences between human and avian IAV strains to determine what prevents avian
IAV strains from entering the human population."

 This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of
longitudinal cognitive outcomes among children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia. The outlined proposal
builds on the candidate’s prior research and experience, and will introduce the candidate to new skills that will
be shared by the mentorship team led by Dr. Gretchen Birbeck, an expert in neuroepidemiology and clinical trials
in resource-limited settings. The proposed training and mentored research will enable the candidate to transition
to an independent research career focused on neurologic complications of HIV.
 Cognitive impairment is common in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in low-resource
settings, affecting up to 50% of perinatally-infected children in Sub-Saharan Africa. In children with HIV receiving
Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), opportunistic infections and severe HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy
have become less common, but more subtle forms of cognitive impairment have increased in prevalence. The
foundation for this proposal is based on research conducted by the candidate as part of the HIV-associated
Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) study, in which 208 children and adolescents with HIV and 208
HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited, and clinical risk factors and biomarkers for cognitive impairment
were evaluated. In the HANDZ study, we found that serum markers produced by activated platelets and pro-
inflammatory monocytes associated with depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment,
suggesting that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) may be key drivers in HIV-associated cognitive
impairment. In the proposed project, the population recruited as part of HANDZ will be followed longitudinally for
a total of five years, and an additional HIV-unexposed uninfected control group will be recruited.
 The aims of this proposal include 1) To evaluate whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes predict
depression and cognitive outcomes in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia 2) To assess
whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes are associated with cerebrovascular disease in ART-treated
children and adolescents with HIV and 3) To develop a comprehensive predictive model of cognitive change in
children with HIV incorporating clinical characteristics, plasma biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers. The short-
term goal of this application is to 1) Train the applicant through mentored research 2) Identify a subpopulation of
children and adolescents with HIV at high risk of cognitive decline and 3) From clinical profiles, plasma
biomarkers and imaging characteristics, identify factors associated with the greatest effect on cognitive outcomes
that can be targeted in future intervention studies. The long-term impact will include setting the stage for clinical
trials of interventions to prevent or treat HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in children and adolescents."
10886549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All animals that can form images in their retinas, from flies to humans, need ON and OFF brain pathways to
process light and dark features in visual scenes. The traditional textbook view is that these ON and OFF
pathways fully converge in visual cortex to make neurons selective to stimulus orientation but invariant to
stimulus polarity and spatial phase. Against this traditional view, our recent work demonstrates that ON and OFF
pathways segregate in visual cortex, specialize in different spatiotemporal functions, and process images
relatively independently from each other. In addition, our preliminary results indicate that ON and OFF cortical
pathways respond very differently to changes in luminance range, which varies continuously in our visual
environment from sunrise to sunset. Based on our results, we hypothesize that luminance perception originates
from the interaction between two separate and relatively independent ON and OFF pathways that are exquisitely
matched to the statistics of light and dark features in natural scenes. This new understanding of ON and OFF
cortical processing has important implications for human luminance perception, image brain processing analysis
and could help improve the diagnostic tools available to manage treatment in human visual disease. In this
proposal, we will investigate how ON and OFF cortical pathways interact to generate luminance perception, and
how these interactions vary with background luminance, luminance range and the rod/cone retinal ratio available
to sample the images. We will then use all these measurements to develop models that replicate human
luminance perception more accurately than in the past and new diagnostic tools that measure human ON and
OFF visual function in diseases that affect the retina (e.g. glaucoma) and visual cortex (e.g. amblyopia)."
10888324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to define the cellular diversity, connectivity and function of inhibitory neurons in the
lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). The LHA is a linchpin in the orchestration of fundamental aspects of behavior
owing to its unique position at the intersection of multiple neural and humoral systems. LHA GABAergic neurons
in particular have emerged as potent actuators of arousal, goal-directed behavior as well as both negative and
positive valence behavior. Within this broad class of inhibitory LHA neurons lie poorly resolved but functionally
important subpopulations, which may differentially determine behavioral output. Important among these is a
population of putative inhibitory neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH).
LHA MCH-expressing neurons (LHAMCH) display remarkable functional diversity, sending extensive projections
throughout the brain and coordinating a broad range of physiological functions and behaviors, including the
modulation of sleep-wake states, feeding, motivated behavior, stress and memory. However, experimental
manipulations of LHAMCH neurons are largely interpreted in the context of LHAMCH neurons being a monolithic,
neuromodulatory projection system, creating a profound knowledge gap as to the source of their functional
diversity. There is, therefore, a critical need to delineate the unique cellular, circuit-level and behavioral impact
of LHAMCH diversity. In the previous grant cycle, we made significant progress towards our long-term goal of
defining the population structure of LHA GABAergic neurons, including the generation of the most
comprehensive cellular taxonomy to date of molecularly distinct LHA cell types in the mouse. Here, we will build
upon that progress through our investigation of: 1) two transcriptomically-distinct LHAMCH subpopulations that
differentially express the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R), the receptor for neurokinin B (NKB); 2) and a novel
projection from NKB neurons in the central extended amygdala to the LHA. In Aim 1, we will determine whether
distinct LHAMCH subpopulations give rise to functional sub-circuits that project to different targets in the brain and
release different neurochemicals using a precise intersectional viral strategy based on the enrichment of NK3R
in one LHAMCH subpopulation over the other. In Aim 2, we will explore whether differential engagement of LHAMCH
subpopulations elicits distinct behavioral repertoires using two parallel intersectional strategies for
optogenetically targeting LHAMCH subpopulations and then subjecting animals to a suite of behavioral
assessments. In Aim 3, we will investigate the biological mechanisms underlying NKB/NK3R signaling in the
central extended amygdala–LHA circuit through a detailed electrophysiological investigation of NKB/GABA co-
transmission onto LHAMCH neurons, and by studying the behavioral impact of these projections. Together, the
proposed experiments will address outstanding questions concerning the cellular and circuit-level functions of
LHAMCH neuron diversity, which is necessary both for a mechanistic understanding of LHA circuit function, and
as a critical precursor for identifying therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric, sleep and metabolic disorders."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic
disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Multicenter
collaborative studies from 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs), organized with a Data Coordinating Center
(DCC) to form the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) has contributed to tremendous progress in
dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies
(GWAS). Our GRC has contributed to all IBDGC studies and has taken roles in IBDGC leadership positions.
Our particular GRC focus is uncovering and characterizing the genetic etiology of IBD, and variations in
phenotypic expressivity and disease course, in the African-American population. We will continue to recruit
and carefully phenotype African-American patients with IBD to maximize power for genetic and phenotype
investigations. We will also recruit patients for parallel IBDGC focused studies in the Hispanic/LatinX
population. We will expand and refine IBD loci contributing to the genetic risk of IBD in African-Americans by
further GWAS, with sex-stratified, and fine-mapping approaches, and evaluate genotype-phenotype
associations. We will perform a multiple immune disease association meta-analyses aggregating genome-
wide data to maximize power to identify common immune mediated disease loci while also characterizing
pleiotropy among the traits evaluated. We will provide critical resources in immune cells isolated from West-
Africans and African-Americans and generate gene expression and epigenetic data for colocalization to
better define disease causing variants and their effect on gene expression that result in the genetic risks of
IBD in the African-American population. Lastly we will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to
maximize the impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transmission from mother to fetus is implicated in ~15% of stillbirths and
~16,000 birth defects annually in the US. HCMV is also the major viral cause of medical complications associated
with bone marrow and organ transplantation. Passive immunization using anti-HCMV enriched human immune
globulin (HIG) has shown promising activity for both indications. HIG is a complex, variable product that may
cause side effects from off-target antibody binding. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) offers qualitative advantages
over HIG including potency, safety, production efficiency and quality control. Trellis Bioscience has discovered
a high affinity native human mAb (TRL345) against the most conserved site on the HCMV virion (gB AD-2 Site
I). TRL345 is a human IgG1kappa (G1m1,17 (z,a); Km3 allotype) monoclonal antibody cloned from human B
lymphocytes. This mAb neutralized 15 out of 15 clinical isolates of all four major serotypes. It protected all of the
specialized cell types relevant to human pathology. It was also fully protective in a model of human placental
fragments grown as tissue explants ex vivo. This published work was completed under a Phase I/II SBIR grant.
A Master Cell Bank has been developed that expresses TRL345 in CHO cells at a commercially useful level
(1.74 g/L) at the 250L GMP scale. All IND-enabling analytical work has been completed, including GLP toxicology
in rats and tissue reactivity profiling. With SBIR CRP funding, the first clinical lot has been manufactured yielding
sufficient material for Phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials. We propose here to conduct a Phase 1 single
ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers."

early to mid-career, postdoctoral, faculty."
10889436,"Exhausted T cells (TEX) differentiate in cancer and chronic infections. TEX do not function optimally and they do
not provide protection. Immunotherapy reinvigorates TEX by antagonizing surface inhibitory receptors, such as
PD-1. However, the epigenetic stability of TEX inhibits complete reversal of exhaustion, therefore significantly
limiting the clinical benefits of immunotherapy. We recently proposed the use of microRNAs to attenuate
exhaustion. MicroRNAs regulate cell differentiation by targeting multiple mRNAs. Indeed, microRNA-29a (miR-
29a) regulates CD8 T cell differentiation, enhances CD8 T cell persistence and function and promotes memory-
like responses in chronic infection by epigenetically altering TEX differentiation. Therefore, we suggest the use of
miR-29a to enhance TEX reinvigoration. However, delivering microRNAs to TEX in vivo is a major challenge.
 The goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate TEX and improve anti-viral and anti-tumor responses using a
novel method for delivery of miR-29a in vivo. Our preliminary data suggest that miR-29a synergizes with αPD-1
to enhance CD8 T cell responses and promote durable, functional CD8 T cell reinvigoration. However, our results
are based on retroviral overexpression in CD8 T cells, which does not allow for delivery of miR-29a to TEX later
when exhaustion has progressed. Therefore, we developed a novel method to deliver miR-29a to already
differentiated TEX in vivo. We conjugated miR-29a to αPD-1 (miR-29a/αPD-1). MiR-29a/αPD-1 increased miR-
29a expression and decreased miR-29a target expression in TEX, suggesting that miR-29a delivery is efficient
and functional. Therefore, our overall hypothesis is that miR-29a/αPD-1 alters T cell differentiation, reinvigorates
TEX, and enhances anti-viral and anti-tumor T cell responses.
Aim 1. Reinvigorate TEX with miR-29a/αPD-1 in vivo. MiR-29a regulates key transcriptional circuits and
synergizes with αPD-1 to promote TEX reinvigoration. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-29a delivery by miR-
29a/αPD-1 can promote TEX reinvigoration both early and late during the differentiation of exhaustion. We will
administer miR-29a/αPD-1 to mice with chronic viral infection (LCMV) or tumors (B16 melanoma or KPC-PDAC).
We will elucidate the role of miR-29a in TEX reinvigoration during the early and late exhaustion phase.
Aim 2. Delineate targeting of immune cells and tumor cells by miR-29a/αPD-1. PD-1 is highly expressed in
TEX, but also in other immune cells, and tumor cells. Interestingly, miR-29a can suppress tumorigenesis and
inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-29a/αPD-1 can provide significant clinical
benefits by targeting both immune and tumor cells. To test this, we will use a fluorescence labelled miR-29a/αPD-
1 to elucidate miR-29a delivery and identify other immune cells and tumor cells targeted by miR-29a/αPD-1.
 At the completion of these studies we will a) demonstrate the ability of miR-29a to prevent and/or reverse
exhaustion, b) develop a novel immunotherapeutic to provide immune reinvigoration with a dual effect on
immune cells and tumor cells, and c) develop a novel platform for in vivo delivery of miRNAs to TEX."
10887670,"Parkinson Disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, leading to progressive motor
and cognitive dysfunction that affects 1% of the population over the age of 60. Although often considered a late
onset disease, several lines of evidence suggest that disease onset occurs decades before motor symptoms
arise. Prodromal PD symptoms, like intestinal dysmotility, anosmia, sleep disturbances, and depression may
present decades prior to the onset of motor deficits, at which point a patient has lost ≥60% of their dopaminergic
(DA) neurons from the substantia nigra (SN). Therefore, this proposal addresses a pivotal question in the study
of late onset neurological disease. The overarching aim of this proposal is to define the timeline along which PD-
related neurodegeneration begins, versus when it begins to produce quantifiable and potentially irreversible
neurological effects. We will begin addressing this question by determining whether there is a critical time interval
in which a PD causative mutation mediates its pathological effect. Indeed, PD mouse models that constitutively
express disease-causing mutations often yield milder phenotypes than those induced later in life. The
observation of this effect in multiple independent strategies points to the potential for developmental
compensation rather than a technical or experimental phenomenon. Whether expression of PD-causing
mutations mediate their effects in a time dependent manner, remains largely untested. By characterizing this
window of pathological effect, our proposed work has the potential to inform a new wave of research involving
therapeutic strategies and early disease screening.
 We propose to employ a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible model of the human alpha synuclein (SNCA) hA53T
PD mutation, under the control of a DA neuron regulatory sequence (PITX3-IRES2-tTA/tetO-A53T) to study this
question directly. To ensure the biological robustness of addressing this question with this Tet-Off model, we will
first evaluate the latency between administration of the tetracycline analog, doxycycline (Dox), and repression of
SNCA A53T transcript and protein levels, as well as between Dox removal/washout and SNCA A53T de-
repression. Next, to determine whether the pathological effect of mutant SNCA is mediated throughout life or
within a defined time window (e.g., gestation, postnatal, juvenile, or mid-adult life), we will activate expression of
the mutant protein across five time windows: between mid-gestation (embryonic day 15.5) and postnatal day 21
(P21), between E15.5 and postnatal day 60 (P60), between P21 and mid-late adulthood (8-16 mos), between
P60 and mid-late adulthood (8-16 mos), and mid-late adulthood (8-16 mos). These will be compared to controls
expressing the mutant protein from E15.5 onwards and those in which the mutant protein remains inactivated.
We will use well-established assays to evaluate the impact on behavioral, motor, and histological phenotypes.
Our proposal will significantly advance the understanding of the context (timing) during which expression of PD
mutations in SNCA mediate their effect in PD-relevant cell types, including DA neurons."

Germline predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies is more common than previously appreciated and is best
understood for the myeloid malignancies. Variants in genes such as RUNX1, DDX41, GATA2, ANKRD26, ETV6,
CEBPA, SAMD9/SAMD9L, and TERT/TERC are among those commonly identified in patients. Recognizing the
importance of germline predisposition to myeloid malignancies, all of the recently-updated classification schema

and development of curation rules for additional genes that confer risk for myeloid malignancies, including
ANKRD26, ETV6, CEBPA, SAMD9/SAMD9L, and TERT/TERC. The MM-VCEP seeks to use segregation codes
at the strongest level possible and will develop novel collaborations with patient/family-focused organizations,
including ConnectMyVariant, the RUNX1 Research Program, and Team Telomere, Inc., to do so. Additional
variant collections that have deep phenotype and provider contact information, such as the St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital SAMD9/SAMD9L database and the Clinical Care Consortium for Telomere-Associated
Ailment international registry, will be incorporated as well. Thus, the MM-VCEP seeks to continue its important
work in providing worldwide standards for consistent variant curation so that patients at risk of developing myeloid
malignancies can receive optimal clinical care and appropriate surveillance strategies for cancer detection and

10887729,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a heavy burden to patients, family and
society. Based on that postmortem AD brains exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, the
“mitochondrial cascade hypothesis” has been proposed that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of AD. The exact mechanism of how mitochondrial dysfunction occurs are still unclear and
we will investigate one critical mechanism of its regulation in vivo. Based on our new finding that O-GlcNAcase
(OGA) activity is decreased in human AD brains we focus on the post-translational protein modification, O-
GlcNAcylation. Importantly, this also related to the altered glucose metabolism in AD since glucose deprivation
also increases this metabolism related post-translational protein modification. In this proposal we will relate
neuroinflammation and AD-dependent changes in metabolism at the level of the astrocytes. These cells play an
essential role in providing neurons with energy support, redox and neuroinflammation modulation. Reactive
astrocytes occur early in AD pathogenesis. However, how astrocytic mitochondrial function are regulated and
whether protein O-GlcNAcylation affects astrocytic mitochondrial function us unknown. Understanding this
regulatory mechanism and how it responds to pharmacological manipulation of OGA activity will give new
insights into the neuroinflammatory aspects of AD. Our preliminary studies in the APPNL-G-F knock-in mouse
(AppKI) model which exhibits neuroinflammation, show that O-GlcNAcylation is also elevated and mitochondrial
related gene expression is upregulated in a small group of reactive astrocytes while downregulated in the majority
of homeostatic astrocytes. This provides us the foundation to test the hypothesis that increased O-GlcNAcylation
impairs astrocytic mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation in vivo. We chose the AppKI mice in our study
because 1) they do not have APP overexpression and thus avoiding non-pathologic gain of function effects of
APP, 2) they exhibit progressive pathological features for plaque and gliosis, synaptic loss, and cognitive
impairment, 3) O-GlcNAcylation effects on mutant APP-based neuroinflammation-related pathogenic
mechanisms are needed to place the reported results on the inhibition of tau phosphorylation in broader context
of AD. This is important as clinical trials with OGA inhibitors are ongoing for tauopathy, based on their ability of
decrease tau phosphorylation and being considered for AD, while their effects on neuroinflammation,
mitochondrial function and APP-based pathological progress are essentially unexplored. Completion of this
exploratory project will provide much-needed critical data addressing the importance of O-GlcNAcylation in
regulating astrocytic mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, and provide novel insights into
neurodegenerative mechanisms which help identify new metabolic targets for therapeutic development."

other West African countries. Our D43 takes a life course approach and is centered on the
principle that environmental exposures drive development of chronic disease and transitions from
health to disease begin in early life. Once risk factors develop, environmental exposures may
accelerate progression to disease and death. We propose to leverage four extant, well-
characterized cohorts (GRAPHS, PRISMA, KHP, and KHDSS) with extensive exposure
repositories to provide mentored research opportunities to examine how environmental
exposures: i) set in motion aberrant developmental trajectories; ii) accelerate progression to
disease once risk factors are established; and iii) are associated with mortality. Ghanaian trainees
will be enrolled in three tracks – PhD training, Master degree training, and short-term workshops.
Training will be led by the Kintampo Health Research Centre, one of three Government of Ghana
research centers and a part of Ghana’s Ministry of Health therefore providing a direct linkage from
research to policy. KHRC will be joined by the University of Ghana’s School of Public Health, a
premier Master and PhD degree-granting institution in Ghana and where coursework will occur,

ATM-SR is to facilitate high-impact cancer-relevant research done by Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI)
members by providing state-of-the-art and comprehensive animal resources. The transgenic and knockout
mouse production services were established at Stanford in 1996 with the overall objective of providing
genetically modified mouse models and associated supporting technologies to Stanford investigators at cost-
effective rates. Preclinical oncology services, including study design, tumor induction, drug administration, PK
and PD study, data collection and analysis, were initiated by the SCI in 2007. These services are provided by
the Transgenic, Knockout and Tumor Model Center (TKTC). The Veterinary Service Center (VSC) in the
Department of Comparative Medicine manages the animal histopathology service component of the shared
resource. Major services include tumor analysis by histology, immunohistochemistry and pathological
interpretation. Since the last review, the animal histology laboratory underwent a major renovation and
expansion. In 2020, 45% of users were SCI investigators. Members from all programs regularly use the ATM-
SR, with the heaviest use coming from the Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapeutics
programs. The ATM-SR contributed to over 17 cancer-focused SCI member publications since 2015; 10 of
them were high-impact. The annual budget of the ATM-SR is $1,250,002 yet the CCSG request is $105,312.
Accordingly, the ATM-SR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 8% from CCSG funds. The
ATM-SR is focused on three major scientific aims: (1) to produce transgenic and knockout mice, (2) to provide
preclinical oncology model services, and (3) to provide histopathology services."

The pathophysiology of C9orf72- and GRN-related Frontotemporal Degeneration links TDP43
proteinopathy to neural network dysfunction, which ultimately manifests as symptoms of motor,
cognitive, and/or behavioral impairment. Patients with ALS exhibit motor cortex hyper-
excitability, which has been used as a physiologic biomarker to assist in diagnosis and
outcomes monitoring in clinical trials. Most of this work has been done in patients with typical
ALS, with questions remaining about whether this abnormal physiologic feature is present in
patients with Frontotemporal Dementia and asymptomatic C9orf72 or GRN carriers.
In this pilot project, we aim to investigate family members of individuals with C9orf72- or GRN-
related FTD to determine whether this may be a universal feature of the illness and whether it is
present prior to the onset of symptoms. We will also examine its relationship to resting-state
functional MRI measures of large-scale brain network function.
The ultimate goal of this research is to begin to determine whether these biomarkers of cortical
physiology could be useful as an early, presymptomatic indicator of brain system dysfunction
and whether it could be useful as an outcome measure for treatment trials."

The purpose of this K01 proposal is to enable the PI to become an independent research investigator with
expertise in focal neuromodulation, clinical investigations, and neuroimaging and psychophysiological biomarker
research in traumatized populations and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The candidate's long-term goal
is to build a NIH-funded research program to advance treatment for trauma-related disorders by understanding
the neurobiological mechanisms of treatment and identifying predictive biomarkers for treatment outcome. The
proposed study leverages the PI's experience with pre- and post-treatment studies in traumatized populations,
PTSD biomarker research, and her strong foundation in neuroimaging and longitudinal data analyses. The
training plan includes structured mentoring, hands-on training in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and
brain functional connectivity (FC) analyses, didactic coursework and a rigorous proposed research study in order
to provide new training in 1) focal neuromodulation (TMS), 2) clinical investigations, 3) FC analyses, and
additional training in 4) PTSD biomarkers, and 5) career development.
With 30-50% of PTSD patients not responding to first line therapies, novel treatments are warranted; however,
development is hampered by a lack of understanding of neural mechanisms underlying recovery from PTSD.
TMS studies in PTSD have applied 1Hz stimulation over the rDLPFC and demonstrated a potential therapeutic
effect, but the mechanism of TMS remains unclear. This K01 proposal aims to advance TMS treatment for PTSD
by better understanding the mechanism of action of TMS and examining the effect of 1Hz rDLPFC stimulation
on PTSD neuroimaging and psychophysiological biomarkers, particularly related to the fear neurocircuitry often
implicated in PTSD and hypothesized to be improved by DLPFC stimulation. The proposed experiments leverage
the infrastructure of the Grady Trauma Project (GTP), the largest civilian PTSD research study, for patient
recruitment and clinical and biological assessment foundation. PTSD patients will be recruited and randomized
to a TMS (N=30) or sham treatment (N=30) group. Neuroimaging and psychophysiological data will be collected
in the week before and after the two-week treatment period (week 4). This K01 project will significantly contribute
to the advancement of treatment for PTSD by: 1) determining if 1Hz TMS to the right DLPFC improves PTSD
intermediate phenotypes; 2) suggesting novel brain modulation targets for future studies; 3) providing preliminary
data for future studies examining individual differences for treatment response; and 4) advancing our
understanding of neurobiology of PTSD treatment response using TMS as a probe."

duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception,
and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable
and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings
(>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and
(C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state-

will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually
increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy
adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create
an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing
nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral
data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements.
This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next
generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological
sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations,
we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology,
and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links
between brain activity and behavior will build."

Aging with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is compounded by onset of behavioral and
psychiatric symptoms (BPSD) seen in over 80% of those with the condition. BPSD often precipitate caregiver
burden, institutionalized care, and increased rates of mortality. Despite the critical need, there currently are few
non-pharmacological interventions to manage BPSD and those that exist have weak evidence. Research: The
project titled, Improving Person-Environment Fit of Community-Residing Older Adults with Dementia Through
Assessment and Individualized Intervention, identifies person-environment relationships as a mechanism of
action to guide assessment of and intervention for functional behavior within the home context for persons with
ADRD. By improving the relationship between persons with ADRD and their home environment (person-
environment fit), it is hypothesized that people with ADRD will have improved BPSD and activity engagement
within their home. We will employ the NIH Stage Model of Behavioral Intervention Development to define
assessment of person-environment fit (Stage 0; Aim 1) and pilot the feasibility of a telehealth intervention to
maximize person-environment fit within the homes of community-residing adults with ADRD within rural
communities (Aim 2). Findings of this research will inform discovery of best practices for a non-pharmacological,
environmental approach to BPSD for persons with ADRD living in their home. Candidate: Dr. Elizabeth Rhodus
is an early-career investigator, who is transitioning from a NIH T32-funded postdoctoral fellowship to a full-time
tenure-track faculty position at the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Medicine. Three training goals will
enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent, successfully funded investigator: 1) Develop a strong
knowledge base on integrated physiological and behavioral assessment of person-environment interactions on
community-dwelling people living with ADRD, 2) Build expertise in development and implementation of
behavioral interventions among older adults with ADRD, and 3) Expand understanding of research strategies for
inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging studies. Mentors/Environment: The current career
development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic training, and experiential learning at the UK Center
for Health Equity Transformation with Director, Dr. Nancy Schoenberg (primary mentor), UK Sanders-Brown
Center on Aging with Associate Director, Dr. Donna Wilcock (co-mentor), Dr. Anton Porsteinsson (mentor), a
prominent clinical researcher and psychiatrist for treatment of BPSD, and a renowned, interdisciplinary advisory
committee. Dr. Rhodus will receive support from her institution through internal grants, faculty education,
networking, and scholarship. Dr. Rhodus has full support from UK (see institutional letter of support) to advance
her career development and research activities. Thus, the overall objective of this K23 application is to propel
the career development of Dr. Rhodus to an independent scientist in ADRD research using the findings of this
project to inform a future extramural R01 targeting non-pharmacological interventions for BPSD management."
10896447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are highly aggressive B-cell malignancies
that are commonly treated with chemotherapy plus an anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab. High-intensity
chemotherapy is required in BL patients, which is associated with severe toxicity and treatment-related mortality
in 10% of patients. Of the patients able to endure therapy, 36% will suffer disease progression and have a dismal
outcome, with only a 1% 3-year progression-free-survival in patients that are primary-refractory. A similar fraction
of DLBCL patients progress during/following first-line therapy and have a median overall survival of 6.3 months.
Recent genomic studies have identified co-occurring genetic alterations that are highly-recurrent in BL and
DLBCL tumors. However, detailed functional analyses have not been performed for the majority of these driver
mutations, and hence there are currently no available targeted therapeutic strategies in either disease.
Mutations of the SMARCA4 and ARID1A genes are together found in approximately 40% of BL tumors, and 12%
of DLBCL tumors. These genes encode two components of a multi-subunit complex, the BAF (aka SWI/SNF)
complex, which functions to activate gene expression by “unpacking” closed and silent states to become open
and active genes. Mutations of SMARCA4 perturb its activity by affecting the catalytic domain, and mutations of
ARID1A lead to loss of protein expression, together representing two alternative mechanisms for loss of function
in the BAF complex. Although the function of the BAF complex has been recently described in other
malignancies, its function during B-cell development, and therefore the consequence of its inactivation in B-cell
lymphoma, remains to be explored.
We have developed animal and cell line models of SMARCA4 and ARID1A inactivation and found that they
regulate distinct processes in B-cell development. We will leverage these models and cutting-edge genomics
approaches to understand both the molecular and immunological consequences of BAF complex deregulation
in B-cell lymphoma. By contrasting and comparing the roles of two key components of the BAF complex,
SMARCA4 and ARID1A, we hope to gain detailed insight into the role of discrete BAF complexes and their
redundant and non-redundant roles. This work will uncover the biology of BL and DLBCL tumors carrying BAF
complex mutations, which can lead to advances in precision medicine targeting and therapies for this disease,
as well as for other cancers."

 Danetta Sloan is an Assistant Scientist, in the Department of Health, Behavior and Society with
education and professional experience as a homecare hospice Social Worker, addressing the needs of
patients and families experiencing end stage Alzheimer’s disease. Her long-term goal is to become a leader in
community-based research to develop, translate, and implement evidenced-based, real world interventions to
reduce inequities in dementia care and access for Aging Black Americans. This award will ensure Dr. Sloan
has the knowledge, skills, and experience to develop, implement and test interventions that build individual and
community capacity to improve early diagnosis, access and quality of care to Black Americans. Dr. Sloan has
convened an outstanding mentorship team with expertise to help develop her career development and provide
training in the relevant research methods to adapt, design cultural appropriate, communication skill building
intervention, to implement and test in the Black Faith community. Despite the growth in dementia information
and dissemination, Black American communities still experience late diagnosis, and suboptimal care, engaging
with dementia care providers later in the disease without adequate knowledge to participate in goal of care
conversations.
 With no cure for Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD), morbidity and mortality remain high
and Black Americans are disproportionately impacted and more likely to have ADRD and be unaware. This
proposal addresses goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease to 1) optimize care quality and
efficiency and 2) enhance public awareness and engagement. This proposal will equip individuals with skills to
identify signs and symptoms, (increase health literacy in dementia) and goal of care communication training
pre-clinical diagnosis. The outcome of the intervention in Aim 3, will afford those who experience dementia the
opportunity to self-advocate, participate in research, and engage in quality of life decision-making and advance
care planning. Feasibility, acceptability, comprehension and satisfaction, with the intervention and self-efficacy
to engage in a goal of care conversation will be assessed."
10896147,"The objective of this University of Florida/Advent Health proposal within the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute
Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC) is to establish a longitudinal prospective cohort of patients with acute and
acute relapsing pancreatitis in order to investigate the incidence, pathophysiology, mechanisms, environmental
and biologic risk factors, and predictors of subsequent diabetes. The Diabetes Institute at UF (UFDI) and the
Advent Health Translational Research Institute have the resources and capabilities required to perform
comprehensive genetic, immunologic, metabolic, histologic, and functional testing to dissect the various
mechanisms underlying diabetes following acute pancreatitis. Our proposal addresses four key needs of the
T1DAPC. 1) A platform for recruiting large numbers of subjects with acute or acute relapsing pancreatitis. The
combined volumes of both health systems approach 2,000 patients admitted with acute pancreatitis yearly.
The clinical expertise and existing clinical research support structure is experienced and capable, and the two
Institutes have the scientific expertise to help define and support the whole variety of mechanistic studies that
will be undertaken; 2) Mechanistic studies of diabetes after acute pancreatitis including a) measuring
autoantibody markers of islet autoimmunity after acute pancreatitis (subaim 1a); b) assessing subjects’ type 1
diabetes genetic risk leveraging a custom genotyping array and log additive genetic risk score (subaim 1b);
comprehensively characterizing 𝛽𝛽-cell function after acute pancreatitis (subaim 1c); and d) analyzing the
imaging features of acute pancreatitis which predict the subsequent development of diabetes (subaim 1d); 3) A
consortium opportunity to study human subjects prior to the development of acute pancreatitis, that occurring
after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). UFHealth and AdventHealth perform
approximately 2,400 of these procedures yearly, and with the participation of other T1DAPC centers, a sub-
cohort could be assembled with biospecimens and imaging data prior to the development of acute pancreatitis,
providing a very useful comparison population for future analyses. 4) Collecting a bank of human pancreata
from subjects with previous pancreatitis. The Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD),
housed at the UFID, collects and processes transplant-grade pancreata and other tissues from organ
procurement organizations (OPOs) across the U.S. and provides them for investigators around the world. We
will leverage this infrastructure, along with that of a large local OPO associated with AdventHealth, to obtain
organs from individuals with a history of acute pancreatitis. This will provide a unique resource for the
T1DAPC, to interrogate the mechanisms of diabetes in tissue, which is not readily accessible in living subjects.
This can provide a clinicopathologic correlation for the T1DAPC mechanistic studies. We believe the types of
analyses proposed will be necessary for the work of the T1DAPC, and we are able to fully support these aims
or related aims selected by the T1DAPC."
10896149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A central goal of neuroscience is to understand animal behavior in the context of the information processing properties of neuron ensembles. Neurons are circuit nodes in the brain information processing network, but they are also cells that express hundreds of genes that may make important contributions to determining their activity patterns. The relationship between gene expression, neuron projections, neuron activity, and behavior have been, individually, major avenues for investigation in both molecular and systems neuroscience. Integrating these levels of investigation would greatly advance understanding the influence of molecular properties on neuron information processing characteristics in healthy brains and disease states. In this project, which we refer to as CaRMA 2.0, we propose to develop and democratize methodologies to integrate measurements of transcriptomics, projectomics, calcium dynamics, and behavior in deep-brain structures. This proposal builds on our past success to develop and implement Calcium and RNA Multiplexed Activity (CaRMA) imaging, which combines these levels of investigation into a single large-scale experiment. This is achieved by deep-brain two-photon calcium imaging in a behaving mouse, followed by removing and sectioning the brain, aligning the ex vivo image volume with the in vivo-imaged neurons, and then performing multiple rounds of RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the same tissue. To reliably produce these high dimensional, multi-modal datasets requires significant advancements for “Optimization of Transformative Technologies for Large Scale Recording and Modulation in the Nervous System” as indicated in this RFA-NS-18-019 program announcement. We will develop improved technologies for deep-brain calcium imaging as well as highly multiplexed gene expression analysis on the same cells and apply this pipeline to investigate the mPFC, hindbrain, and the role of the lateral hypothalamus in hunger, thirst, and fear."
10896265,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects an estimated 20-30% of adults in the western world. Most
NAFLD is benign, but up to 30% of NAFLD patients will develop a progressive form of fatty liver termed
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the leading cause of severe liver disease, leading to >$175 billion
in healthcare costs over the next two decades in the US, and NASH prevalence is rising. Diagnosed early, NASH
may be reversed with lifestyle intervention. Unfortunately, the only way to distinguish NASH from benign fatty
liver is through invasive biopsy, which is impractical for repeated sampling to monitor disease progression or
treatment response. Thus there is a major unmet need for the noninvasive detection of NASH at an early stage.
A second major unmet need is the lack of a noninvasive method to assess treatment response in NASH.
 Histologic scoring of NASH is based on the presence of steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, inflammation,
and fibrosis; however fibrosis is the only histologic feature that is linked to progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular
carcinoma or liver failure. Technology to noninvasively image NASH disease activity which drives progression
of liver fibrosis could profoundly alter our ability to diagnose NASH and monitor treatment response. Serum
biomarker panels and ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) elastography methods can reasonably detect liver
fibrosis at very advanced stages (F4) but are ineffective at detecting earlier stages of fibrosis (F1, F2), and none
of these techniques have been shown to be effective in monitoring treatment response in clinical trials. These
unmet needs extend to other chronic liver diseases, e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis, alcoholic steatohepatitis.
 We recently developed a class of gadolinium (Gd)-based MR imaging probes that are capable of quantifying
fibrogenesis – the disease activity process by which collagen is crosslinked and fibrosis occurs – through
molecular targeting of extracellular protein-bound aldehydes generated during collagen crosslinking. We have
shown in animal models that molecular MR of fibrogenesis has exquisite sensitivity for early fibrosis detection
and is also an early reporter of treatment response, noninvasively detecting positive tissue remodeling processes
prior to reduction in liver fibrosis. However, there is concern about the safety of Gd-based imaging probes due
to Gd retention and toxicity, thus limiting the commercial potential of Gd-based probes.
 Reveal Pharma has developed proprietary “RVP” manganese-chelate technology to replace the use of Gd in
MR agents. In this Fast Track application we will develop a Gd-free fibrogenesis-specific MR imaging probe. In
Phase I we will synthesize a library of probes and demonstrate fibrogenesis-specific imaging in a mouse model
of NASH. In Phase II, we will perform lead optimization; select a candidate “RVP-FI” for ultimate clinical
development; and validate both its safety and utility in different animal models. The result will be a highly sensitive
MR fibrogenesis probe with demonstrated in vivo efficacy and safety, poised for clinical development."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder that leads to end-
stage kidney disease. Despite decades of research, tolvaptan is the only approved intervention in ADPKD.
However, tolvaptan does not target cardiovascular complications of ADPKD and is constrained by high cost
and side effects that limit adherence. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a well-tolerated alternative
intervention to slow ADPKD progression and improve vascular health. Sodium-glucose cotransporters-2
inhibitors (SGLT2i) have a track record of tolerability and safety in patients with proteinuric diabetic and non-
diabetic kidney disease. Trials of SGLT2i in these conditions have been extremely encouraging, and these
treatments are highly likely to become the standard of care for diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease;
however, the mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, and may be non-specific to disease etiology. The
potential benefit of SGLT2i has not been examined in patients with ADPKD, as major trials have excluded such
patients. There are also potential benefits of SGLT2i to ADPKD patients beyond slowing loss of kidney
function, as this class of drugs provide a cardiovascular mortality benefit for patients across the CKD spectrum.
Studies testing the effects of SGLT2i in animal models of PKD have yield conflicting results. Five weeks of
treatment with an SGLT1 and SLGT2 inhibitor phlorizon was shown to inhibit cystogenesis in the Han:SPRD
rat model of PKD. The mechanisms by which SGLT2i slows cystic renal disease progression may be related to
inhibition of cyst epithelial cell proliferation. SGLT2i have also antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, which
are important for reducing fibrosis and improving vascular health, both of which occur in early stages of
ADPKD. While many changes likely contribute to the development of arterial dysfunction in patients with
ADPKD, among those of greatest concern is the development of stiffening of large elastic arteries, typically
assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). We propose a pilot randomized clinical trial to determine the
safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in ADPKD patients. To achieve this, we will conduct a 12-month parallel-
group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 ADPKD patients with an eGFR 30-90
mL/min/1.73m2. Secondary, exploratory endpoints will determine the effect of empagliflozin on kidney volume,
kidney function, aPWV, plasma copeptin levels, urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and quality of life.
Specific Aim 1: To determine the feasibility, in terms of safety and tolerability, of prescribing empagliflozin 25
mg once a day in ADPKD patients at risk for progression with an eGFR of 30-90 mL/min/1.73m2.
Specific Aim 2: To derive preliminary estimates of the effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo on 12-
month change in a) total kidney volume by magnetic resonance imaging, b) eGFR, c) plasma copeptin levels
(a marker of vasopressin secretion), d) urinary KIM-1 (a marker of tubular injury), e) aPWV; and f) ADPKD-
specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as quantified by the ADPKD-Impact Scale."

Lewy body dementia (LBD), a class of disorders comprising Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB), features aggressive cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline without cure or effective
mitigating therapies. Driving the clinical challenges surrounding LBD is a poor understanding of the
pathophysiology underlying its clinical deterioration and a desperate lack of diagnostic, progressive, and
therapeutic biomarkers. Neuropathological evidence suggests that corticolimbic synucleinopathy is closely linked
to the aggressive dementia of LBD and that effective biomarkers of cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline would
necessarily reflect this corticolimbic dysfunction. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the corticolimbic LBD
brain features regional and disease-specific alterations in neuronal and non-neuronal pathways reflected
as unique protein signatures in CSF and plasma. To investigate this hypothesis, we will apply an integrated
network-based proteomic pipeline across brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma to identify LBD biofluid
signatures anchored in corticolimbic pathophysiology. Our preliminary experience with this pipeline suggests it
is a powerful promoter of multiplexed biomarker assays reflective of diverse brain-based dysfunction, including
neuronal, glial, and endothelial pathophysiology. In addition to these proteomic experiments, we will also
establish an Emory LBD registry under the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) and utilize its clinical
and biospecimen data to fuel proteomic validation studies and promote future LBD research. Our specific aims
include 1) building a longitudinal PDBP registry for LBD, 2) defining the corticolimbic network proteome of LBD,
3) performing brain-biofluid proteomic integration to identify promising biofluid markers, and 4) longitudinal
biofluid validation using targeted proteomic strategies. In addition to biospecimens collected in Aim 1, we will
supplement these experiments using existing brain and biofluid samples housed in Emory Goizueta Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center biorepositories. Ultimately, our efforts to identify molecular signatures of cognitive and
neuropsychiatric decline in LBD promise to discover novel biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis, disease
monitoring, and gauging therapeutic response. Furthermore, such markers can serve as a necessary gateway
to effective drug therapies for this devastating spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases."
10896334,"SUMMARY
During vertebrate development, the visceral endoderm recruits adjacent mesoderm to form a primitive gut tube,
which later gives rise to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Organogenesis and tissue homeostasis within the GI tract
require continuous crosstalk between endodermal epithelium and the adjacent mesenchyme. Outstanding
studies in the field have elucidated the critical regulatory mechanisms controlling intestinal epithelial self-renewal
and regeneration. However, little is known about the biology of GI mesenchyme. During gut development, the
visceral mesoderm undertakes remarkable transformation during gut development; it differentiates from a thin
layer of progenitor cells into a complex tissue comprised of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial
cells. More importantly, mesenchymal/stromal dysfunction is also closely associated with many digestive
diseases and cancers. Thus, understanding the genetic and molecular bases underlying mesenchymal growth
and differentiation may lead to future design of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for GI diseases. Our
recent work identified a previously unappreciated requirement of Hippo/YAP signaling in GI mesenchyme to
coordinate growth and patterning during embryonic development. The TEAD family transcription factors are
considered as the major mediator of Hippo/YAP signaling output; however, the physiological roles of TEAD
proteins in mammalian development remain poorly characterized. In this application, we will use a combination
of rigorous mouse genetics and chemical biology approaches to decipher the roles and underlying mechanism
of TEAD regulation in gut development and homeostasis. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the mechanism
underlying AP1-YAP/TEAD cooperation in gut mesenchyme. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the YAP/TAZ-
independent TEAD function in gut development. In Specific Aim 3, we will use a chemical biology approach to
determine the functional significance of TEAD palmitoylation in hamartomatous polyposis. The successful
completion of the proposed studies in this application will provide significant progress towards our understanding
of the fundamental mechanisms underlying GI development, homeostasis and pathogenesis."
10896333,"Abstract
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a genetic disorder that results in premature and accelerated
aging, while accumulation of progerin also occurs during physiological aging. Notably, one of the major targets
of HGPS is the cardiovascular system, which are mechanically active tissues. Typical symptoms include
hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, calcific aortic stenosis, and peripheral
atherosclerosis. For example, autopsy findings have illustrated profound loss of vascular smooth muscle cells
(SMCs) in the medial layer of large arteries, such as the aorta and carotid arteries, with replacement by
collagen and extracellular matrix. Vascular wall echodensity is also increased in HGPS patients associated
with exaggerated fibrotic adventitia formation. The overarching goal of this proposal is to optimize a biomimetic
HGPS-on-a-chip system generated with patient-derived fibroblasts (FBs), SMCs, and endothelial cells (ECs)
that allow application of relevant cyclic stretch for performing ‘clinical trials’ or informing clinical trial designs for
HGPS patients. In particular, we will generate a whole-thermoplastic microfluidic system with a dual-layer
blood vessel-mimicking structure. Based on our preliminary device previously already reported, the proposed
system will be whole-thermoplastic consisting of two channels separated by a thin thermoplastic polyurethane
(TPU) membrane. On top, layers will include a collagen hydrogel encapsulating FBs (adventitia) and an elastin
hydrogel embedded with SMCs (media), post-seeded again with a monolayer of ECs. This methodology
recreates the in vivo microenvironment of blood vessels to faithfully model pathological changes in HGPS."
10896336,"Project Summary: The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand how specific protein kinase signaling
pathways function together with phosphoserine/threonine-binding domains and RNA binding proteins (RNA-
BPs) to regulate tumor development after exposure to inflammation and genotoxic stress. We are particularly
interested in understanding how these pathways can be manipulated to enhance cancer prevention, as well as
to improve the response of any tumors that do form to conventional anti-cancer agents. In addition to the two
canonical DNA damage response pathways that cells use to respond to DNA damage, the ATR-Chk1 pathway,
and the ATM-Chk2 pathway, we recently identified a third DNA damage response pathway mediated by
p38MAPK and MAPKAP Kinase-2 (MK2) that is absolutely essential for p53-defective tumor cells to survive
after genotoxic stress. Importantly, the MK2 pathway is dispensable in cells with intact p53 function, making it
an ideal target for specifically impairing the ability of cells undergoing cancer transformation to survive
additional DNA damage. Unlike the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways that are dedicated to responding
solely to signals from DNA damage, the p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway is a global stress-response pathway
activated by multiple types of cellular stress, and plays a critical role in cytokine production during inflammation
and early tumor development. Thus, we believe that the p38MAPK-MK2 pathway plays a particularly novel role
during oncogenesis following genotoxic stress by integrating DNA damage response pathways within the
damaged cells with inflammation and cytokine signaling arising in the adjacent stromal microenvironment.
Importantly, both the DNA damage response function, and the cytokine production function of MK2, as well as
many of the activities controlled by ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1, appear to be mediated, in large part, by the
action of RNA-BPs, which control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Finally, we and others have
observed that certain xenobiotics appear to cause cell injury and death not through DNA damage, but instead
through a distinct RNA damage response that has been very poorly characterized to date.
 In this proposal we (1) investigate the role of MK2 signaling in both the epithelial compartment and the
inflammatory microenvironment in murine models of genotoxic stress-induced cancer development; (2)
elucidate the emerging roles of RNA-binding proteins as key mediators of the cellular response to DNA
damage; and (3) explore a poorly understood RNA damage response that induces profound apoptosis in a
wide variety of epithelial tissues. The flexibility afforded by R-35 mechanism allows us to pursue these
questions using a wide variety of combined experimental and computational approaches. The resulting
mechanistic models are then tested in vivo using murine models of environmental stress-induced cancer and
by querying human patient derived datasets, in order to achieve a transformational impact in the environmental
health sciences.

10896454,"Project Summary
Aberrant cognitive function is a hallmark of alcohol use disorders (AUD), disrupting daily function and
contributing to alcohol abuse and relapse. Identifying the nature of these deficits is challenged by a lack of
understanding of involved cortical circuits and mechanisms. AUD shows altered orbital frontal (OFC) and
pre-supplementary motor area (Pre-SMA) cortical function, regions implicated in cognitive functions necessary
for decision-making. The mechanisms underlying behavioral and circuit dysfunction are not clear. OFC
hypoactivity resulted in a loss of value-based control over goal-directed behavior; however additional cortical
circuits have been implicated in behavioral flexibility, including Pre-SMA, whose rodent homologue is the
secondary motor cortex (M2), and its output to DS. Increased Pre-SMA/M2 activity is correlated with behavioral
inflexibility and impulsivity in AUD; however, no preclinical studies have examined effects of chronic alcohol
exposure on M2 circuit function or its output to DS. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that AUD
alters OFC and Pre-SMA/M2 circuit function and striatal output, resulting in inflexible behavior
underlying dysfunctional decision-making. The current proposal addresses this through three Aims with
experiments to be conducted in mice. Aim 1 examines the influence of chronic alcohol on OFC output to M2
contributing to behavioral flexibility. A series of ex vivo slice physiology and in vivo activity monitoring and
manipulation experiments will test the hypothesis that chronic intermittent ethanol exposure and repeated
withdrawal (CIE) decreases OFC-M2 transmission important for behavioral flexibility. In Aim 2, effects of
chronic alcohol on M2 function and its contribution to ethanol self-administration will be examined. By
examining effects of chronic ethanol on identified M2 cell type transmission ex vivo and the dynamics and
functional contribution of such output to ethanol self-administration in vivo, this aim will address the hypothesis
that CIE alters M2 transmission and results in hyperactivity of M2 excitatory populations to contribute to
inflexible alcohol self-administration. Lastly, Aim 3 will examine effects of CIE on M2-DS output and control
over ethanol-seeking. An integrative ex vivo and in vivo approach will be taken to address the hypothesis that
CIE produces aberrant control over striatal processes through increased activation and output of motor-related
circuits. Together, these aims will inform how CIE affects cortical circuits and alters their recruitment of striatum
to disrupt goal-directed control, thereby identifying novel targets for AUD treatment. Identifying the
mechanisms underlying chronic alcohol-induced alterations to cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal circuits is a
critical step towards understanding how their disruption contributes to AUD."
10896456,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although amyloids are best understood for their roles in the etiology of numerous human diseases as
pathological protein deposits, amyloid and amyloid-like assemblies can serve critical functions1. To mediate
these functions, some cells have the ability to regulate assembly and clearance of these structures2,3. My
research vision is to delineate the physiological pathways and mechanisms that healthy cells have evolved to
regulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. These studies are motivated by our discovery that in
order to control translation during meiosis, budding yeast regulates assembly of the RNA-binding protein Rim4
into a translational repressor that has several biochemical properties of an amyloid (thus termed amyloid-like)2.
Knowledge gained from these studies will lead to important advances in our understanding of the causes of
neurodegenerative diseases and in time could lead to therapeutic opportunities.
 Based on our recent progress studying Rim4 clearance, we now appreciate that yeast cells use multi-
site phosphorylation to abruptly reverse amyloid-like Rim4 into oligomers and monomers at meiosis II onset4. A
major goal of my research program over the next five years is to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying this remarkable process. Additionally, we will decipher the signals and pathways that trigger the
formation of Rim4 assemblies and we will elucidate how translation is regulated by these structures.
 Budding yeast is a powerful experimental system to study these processes. My lab can easily grow
populations of cells that rapidly and synchronously produce, and then clear, amyloid-like Rim4. We have
developed fluorescence-based reporters that allow us to quantify Rim4 assembly and function in single cells
and selection-based reporters that enable robust genetic screens. We have used these tools, in combination
with biochemical approaches, to begin to illuminate the essential factors that govern how these extraordinary
structures are constructed by the cell and the molecular mechanisms underpinning their function.
 The MIRA award provided me with the support that I needed to launch and maintain my independent
research program. While we made substantial progress towards our stated goals, this award also gave the
researchers in my lab the freedom to explore fruitful departures from our main focus. For example, we
discovered that yeast cells utilize amyloid-like Rim4 to block the translation of retrotransposon mRNA to protect
the genomic integrity of developing gametes. By making these unexpected discoveries and by developing new
tools, my lab has entered an exciting phase where we are rapidly gaining important insights into how cells
regulate, utilize, and process amyloid-like assemblies. Each discovery serves as a potential lead toward a
therapy for amyloid-related diseases, which are needed because few, if any, effective preventative therapies
are currently available. Columbia University and the Taub Institute for Alzheimer’s and Aging Research
provides the supportive framework and collaborative opportunities to make this possible."

spanning their enrollment at FRCC and CSU. The NOCO B2B traineeship program will provide
a scaffold of academic support services, co-curricular and extra-curricular programming and
mentored-research opportunities to underrepresented Front Range Community College (FRCC)
through a B2B learning community. Trainees will be coached to follow an optimal enrollment
pattern to advance toward completion of a bachelor’s degree in a timely manner via an
articulated pathway for transfer to their major at CSU. Trainees will begin their traineeship at
FRCC the spring semester prior to transfer to CSU and participate in summer research
experiences for undergraduates (REU) at CSU. Scholarships will provide financial support to
allow students to enroll full-time. Stipends will alleviate students’ need for low-wage
employment unrelated to their career path and allow them to focus on their research training.
The program creates continuity between the FRCC and CSU experience through the use of
articulated MAPs, co-enrollment opportunities at CSU prior to transfer, and a transfer learning
community at CSU with social and academic events, and an upper division, 1-credit Transfer
Student Seminar, “Becoming a Scientist.” The cohort-based program allows students to make
strong connections amongst faculty, mentors and peers contributing to retention and
completion. Sixty FRCC UR students will participate in the traineeship program and receive
two years of scholarships and stipend support. 100% of trainees will complete a Summer REU;
100% of the trainee cohort who transfer to CSU will join the Transfer Student Learning
Community and complete the Transfer Student Seminar “Becoming a Scientist;” 75% of trainees
will complete a B.S. degree within three years of transferring; 80% of completers will obtain
employment in a field related to their major or apply to a graduate program in behavioral or
bioscience."

 The remarkable functional versatility of the actin cytoskeleton stems from its ability to assemble into a variety
of diverse structures – branched networks, meshes, and bundles. This architectural complexity is orchestrated
by actin-binding proteins, whose activity is delicately regulated in response to internal and external signals. Our
long-term goal is to contribute to human health and well-being by advancing the understanding of the actin
cytoskeleton organization by actin-bundling proteins and their contribution to pathologies (e.g., congenital
diseases and metastatic cancers). Plastin/fimbrin family of cytoskeleton organizers are conserved proteins that
promote assembly of actin filaments into bundles involved in cell migration, adhesion, cytokinesis, and formation
of stereocilia and microvilli structures of the inner ear, intestinal and kidney epithelia. Of three human plastin
(PLS) isoforms, PLS1 deletion results in deafness, PLS2 contributes to pathologies of the immune system and
the development of aggressive metastatic cancers, while mutations in PLS3 lead to severe osteoporosis with
bone fragility and other connective tissue disorders. Despite the importance and a long-lasting interest of the
research community to these proteins, understanding of their interaction with actin and their regulation is
superficial, whereas published structural and biochemical data are incomplete, scattered, and sometimes
contradictory. The overall objective of the current proposal is to fill these major gaps by providing a thorough
characterization of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the function of plastins and to demonstrate
how this improved understanding can contribute to explaining the pathology of plastin-related diseases. We
propose that the unique domain organization of plastins enables several regulation modes interconnected via a
central allosteric mechanism that confers multifaceted contribution to various actin-governed cellular processes.
Biochemical characterization of plastin isoforms will reveal mechanisms of their regulation and function at the
molecular level (Aim 1a,b); high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM)/cryo-electron tomography (ET)
reconstruction will provide structural details of plastin interaction with actin (Aim 1c); structural analysis and
atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will generate a model of the auto-inhibition allowing to predict
functional outcomes of congenital mutations (Aim 2); while Aim 3 will focus on understanding functional
significance and implications of the allosteric auto-inhibition of plastins and its role in cooperation with other actin-
binding proteins. These approaches, supported by single-molecule speckle (SiMS), total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF), and bulk epi-fluorescence microscopy, will unveil plastin dynamics, cooperation with protein
partners, and contribution to actin-dependent processes in living cells. The proposal will result in a breakthrough
in the understanding of the actin-dependent cellular events controlled by the plastin/fimbrin family of cytoskeleton
organizers, uncover molecular mechanisms behind plastin-linked congenital (deafness, osteoporosis, and
diaphragmatic hernia) and acquired (cancer) diseases, opening opportunities for their specific therapeutics."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder.
Although the prevalence of AD is increasing, there are no effective therapies that can prevent or delay AD onset.
 Brain-derived lipoproteins (BLps) transport lipids throughout the brain and can protect against or
exacerbate AD progression, depending on their composition. For example, the E4 isoform of the major BLp
scaffold protein APOE can stabilize amyloid-beta (Aβ), leading to plaque formation and AD risk. However, due
to the suboptimal isolation of BLps in earlier studies, and the use of unlipidated APOE4, important questions
have been left unanswered. What factors regulate BLp processing, and can they be targeted to treat AD?
 Microglia play a major role in BLp processing and AD pathophysiology. Recent studies have shown that
phagocytic microglia are defined by their elevated expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL); the rate-limiting enzyme
in lipoprotein hydrolysis and uptake. Notably, LPL-expressing microglia engulf Aβ to protect against Aβ plaque
formation. The notion that LPL is protective is consistent with epidemiological studies showing reduced Aβ
plaque formation and decreased AD prevalence in individuals harboring gain-of-function LPL variants. Although
LPL is a potential target for the treatment of AD, this has not been validated in vivo.
 My laboratory has substantial expertise in lipid metabolism, LPL biology, and microglia and is uniquely
positioned to investigate LPL as a therapeutic target for AD. We have previously shown that LPL regulates
microglial phagocytosis, lipoprotein uptake, and immune function, hence identifying LPL as an immunometabolic
gatekeeper in microglia. Furthermore, our compelling preliminary data has shown that increasing LPL activity
can enhance microglial phagocytosis of Aβ and BLps. Therefore, we hypothesize that microglial-LPL helps
to clear Aβ and excess BLps to protect against AD development and that increasing LPL activity in vivo
can ameliorate AD progression. To test this, in AIM I, we will use microglial-specific knockdown mice
(MiLPLKD) and AD-susceptible mice (5xFAD) to empirically determine whether pharmacological LPL activation
can halt AD progression. We will also use state-of-the-art metabolic imaging and ‘omics approaches to identify
LPL-dependent mechanisms controlling microglial metabolism and function. In AIM II, we will use native BLps
carefully isolated from human CSF to define LPL-dependent mechanisms governing lipoprotein processing by
microglia and to determine whether enhancing LPL activity is a rational strategy to restore lipid handling in
APOE4 carriers. The findings from this study will be transformative to our understanding of lipoprotein handling
in the brain and the mechanisms leading to AD neuropathogenesis. Our study will not only determine LPL-
dependent mechanisms regulating microglial metabolism and function but will also ascertain whether novel LPL
activators can improve microglial function to ameliorate AD pathology, a new strategy with major clinical impact."

With massive data from genome, exposome and phenome rapidly available in population and clinical studies,
data science has emerged to be critically important and provides unprecedented opportunities for new
discoveries in cancer. This competing renewal application of an NCI Outstanding Investigator Award (R35)
aims at developing and applying scalable, interpretable and transferable statistical and machine learning (ML)
methods for integrative analysis of massive germline whole genome sequencing (WGS) and somatic whole
exome sequencing (WES) data, epidemiological and clinical data, in large-scale multi-ethnic biobanks,
population and clinical studies of cancer, with experimental cell specific multi-omic functional data, such as
single cell RNA/ATAC-seq data. Our ultimate goal is to use advanced data science methods and different
types of population, clinical, and experimental data to accelerate progress in advancing from cancer gene
mapping to mechanisms to cancer prevention and medicine, discover new effective trans-ethnic precision
cancer prevention and treatment strategies, and reduce health disparities in cancer genetic research. This
application aims to meet the pressing quantitative needs for the analysis of massive data in cancer research.
Specifically, (A) for genetic cancer epidemiology, we will develop scalable, interpretable and transferable
statistical and ML methods for (1) rare variant analysis by integrating population-based WGS and experimental
single cell functional data; (2) advancing from associated variants with unknown causality and biology to causal
variants, genes and pathways using causal mediation analysis and Mendelian Randomization by integrating
genetic, cell-specific omic, biomarkers and phenotype data; (3) estimating transferable trans-ethnic polygenetic
risk scores (PRSs) and heritability using common and rare variants by integrating WGS data with experimental
in-silicon cell-specific functional annotations and non-genetic data, for actionable prevention strategies; (3)
federated and transferable trans-ethnic single phenotype and phenome-wide genetic analysis in large WGS
studies and biobanks. (B) For cancer genetic medicine, we will develop scalable and interpretable statistical
and machine learning methods for (1) joint analysis of germline WGS and tumor somatic WES data to identify
genetic variants that predispose to cancer subtypes; (2) integrative analysis of tumor somatic WES data and
clinicopathological characteristics to identify patient profiles for improved efficacy of immunotherapies; (3)
analysis of the effects of clonal hematopoiesis, mitochondrial dysfunctions, leukocyte telomere length called
from germline WGS data on tumor somatic events, cancer prognosis and responses to immunotherapies. We
will apply the proposed methods in lung cancer and breast cancer genetic epidemiological and clinical studies
and biobanks. We will develop open access cluster and cloud-based software of these methods and data
resources and make them available at NIH Data Commons to the cancer research community."

Resistant hypertension (RH) doubles the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to non-resistant
hypertension. Defined as having uncontrolled high blood pressure despite the use of at least 3 antihypertensive
medications or controlled blood pressure on at least 4 medications, RH is estimated to affect at least 20 million
Americans. Importantly, true RH must be differentiated from pseudo-resistant hypertension (pseudo-RH),
occurring when blood pressure remains elevated due to extrinsic factors such as suboptimal medication dosing,
medication non-adherence, or white-coat effect. Inability to distinguish true RH from pseudo-RH, and tailor
treatment accordingly, compounds the risks of overtreating pseudo-RH (e.g. syncope, falls, acute kidney injury)
as well as undertreating true RH (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction). Distinguishing true from pseudo-RH,
however, is clinically difficult, in part given the complexities involved in capturing medication adherence patterns
and confirming white-coat effect. Therefore, our overall objective is to determine whether electronic health record
(EHR) based analytics and tools can be used to close persistent gaps in care for RH. The specific aims of the
research project are to: (1) develop and validate a computerized algorithm that uses EHR data to identify RH
and distinguish between true and pseudo-RH including its subtypes; (2) develop and optimize a CDS tool for
aiding clinicians in the identification and management of apparent RH; and, (3) pilot the implementation of a
CDS tool for facilitating care of RH in addition to pseudo-RH and its subtypes. This research promises to enhance
our understanding of how health information technology can be leveraged to inform scientific discovery, while
also driving high-value care for RH. The proposed work will be conducted as part of a K23 award program,
designed provide the advanced research skills and experience needed for the PI to successfully pursue an
independent academic career focused on: (i) optimizing value of care (i.e. improved quality at decreased cost);
(ii) leveraging health information technology and clinically generated data to gain new insights into disease
states; and, (iii) promoting innovation in care delivery using implementation science principles. The PI will
accomplish the proposed research and training aims with the support of his mentoring team: Dr. Teryl Nuckols
(health services research and value of care), Dr. Susan Cheng (preventive cardiology, large data analytics, and
population health) and, Dr. Joshua Pevnick (clinical informatics). These efforts will be supported by the
outstanding research environment and infrastructure of Cedars-Sinai including the Smidt Heart Institute, the
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Research Center, and the Research Informatics and Scientific Computing Core.
Given the strong mentoring, institutional, and infrastructure supports in place, the proposed K award program is
ideally designed to provide the experience needed to launch the PI in his career as an independent investigator
and future leader in cardiovascular outcomes research."
10896424,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Many studies have shown that providing care for a spouse with dementia can be quite stressful, leading
to a heightened risk for depression, multiple negative health outcomes, frailty, and early mortality. Stress-
and depression-related immune system alterations are seen as a key pathway to poorer health in
caregivers. However, the health impacts of caregiver stress have been questioned in recent years, based
on newer evidence that caregiving may benefit health and extend lifespan. Furthermore, even though
caregivers have typically had poorer immune function than noncaregiving controls, the clinical significance
of these differences has been questioned. These discrepant findings reflect both methodological and
conceptual issues that this project will address.
 Three molecular aging biomarkers (telomere length, p16INK4a expression, and epigenetic age) have each
been associated with multiple diseases and disorders. Their combined use will provide an innovative way to
quantify the long-term health risks of caregiving, allowing us to ask novel questions: Does caregiving
accelerate aging? Can caregiving-related distress propel molecular aging and shorten health span (the
length of time that a person is healthy—not just alive)? We will also assess three stress-sensitive pathways
relevant to molecular aging: inflammation, intestinal permeability, and cytomegalovirus serostatus and
reactivation. Drawing on behavioral, immunological, and molecular aging research, this transdisciplinary
study will assess concurrent and prospective relationships related to key caregiving risk-related dimensions
(gender, social relationships, caregiving intensity/burden, and benefit finding), and these aging biomarkers.
Spousal dementia caregivers and sociodemographically-comparable married noncaregivers will be
evaluated at study intake and then again one and two years later. This design will provide longitudinal data
to assess changes in caregiving, depression, key risk behaviors, aging biomarkers, and the stress-sensitive
pathways related to molecular aging. We have three specific aims: 1) To characterize the concurrent and
prospective differences between caregivers and noncaregivers on the molecular aging biomarkers,
inflammation, and mood. 2) To assess the relationships among the molecular aging biomarkers. 3) This
exploratory aim addresses the relative contributions of key risk-related dimensions to depression,
accelerated increases in aging biomarkers, and inflammation.
 This proposal describes a distinctly novel methodology that will provide a way to test innovative and
original hypotheses about the ways that spousal dementia caregiving impacts lifespan and health span. The
interactions between behavior and molecular aging represent an important new frontier for understanding
how caregiving (and other chronic stressors) can accelerate or slow aging. This cutting edge research will
help illuminate the mechanisms through which caregiving and depression influence health and longevity."

Latina adolescents in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS/sexually-transmitted infections
(STIs) and other adverse consequences of risky sexual behavior. The home environment is recognized to
shape adolescents' health outcomes, but only one Latina mother-daughter sexual health program was
identified in the literature. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible Adolescents and Adults) is an
evidence-based intervention for African American adolescent girls and their mothers, which is well-suited to be
adapted for Latinas. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Chicago, the program reduced the risk of new
STIs by 45% compared to the control group among 14-18-year-olds. In this K99/R00 award, I propose to
adapt IMARA to a Latina audience and pilot an optimization trial within community-based organizations
(CBOs) in Chicago, using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is a methodological
framework for developing an optimal intervention package by assessing the effectiveness of an intervention's
components prior to subjecting the intervention to an RCT. This grant focuses on the preparation phase of
MOST, using an implementation science (IS) approach and drawing on community-based participatory
research (CBPR) principles to pursue three specific aims: 1) adapt the intervention for Latinas by establishing
a community advisory board and engaging 12 mother-daughter dyads in 4 focus group discussions (K99
phase); 2) establish the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the intervention components through
piloting among 24 new dyads (K99 phase); and 3) pilot an optimization trial of the adapted intervention among
92 new dyads and examine intervention component effects on risky sexual behavior (primary outcome) and
STI incidence (secondary outcome) (R00 phase). These research aims will allow me to build on my strong
research and publishing experience in adolescent health and capitalize on the expertise of my mentorship
team in sexual risk interventions for youth to achieve four training aims, to: 1) gain knowledge in CBPR
principles and their application; 2) develop expertise in IS theory/design and its application; 3) learn to employ
innovative research designs, analysis strategies, and frameworks for behavioral interventions, including MOST;
and 4) further my professional development to obtain a tenure-track faculty position prior to the R00 phase. I
will accomplish my training aims through meetings, directed readings, and conference/workshop attendance,
with support from my mentors (Primary Mentor: Geri Donenberg). Findings will form the basis of an R01
application for a fully-powered optimization trial to test intervention component impacts on STI incidence
among Latina adolescents. The long-term goal is to generate an efficient, sustainable adapted intervention with
potential for scale-up with CBOs serving Latinas. This K99/R00 award will give me a platform on which to
launch my career as an independent adolescent health researcher, specialized in innovative methods
for developing, implementing, and evaluating behavioral interventions."

Memory T cells chronicle an individual’s infectious past and afford protection to reinfection. Historically defined
in blood and subdivided based on their ability to access secondary lymphoid organs, an additional mechanism
of T cell immunosurveillance has more recently been described. Here, memory T cells forgo systemic
recirculation in exchange for durable residence in non-lymphoid tissues (NLT). Such tissue resident memory T
cell (TRM) provide a mechanism for stockpiling immunity within specific barrier compartments commonly exploited
by pathogens as portals of entry into the body. TRM function by rapidly intercepting invading pathogens and
orchestrating collaborative immune responses. Within NLT, T cell immunosurveillance is predominated by TRM
where they accelerate protection against reinfection, may be associated with tumor control, and may also
facilitate the persistence of certain allergic and autoimmune diseases. These observations have bolstered TRM
as major targets for vaccination. The therapeutic manipulation of TRM holds tremendous promise for the treatment
of organ-specific immunological disorders, autoimmunity, and solid cancers. While extensively studied in other
mucosal sites, there is presently a fundamental void in our understanding of the ontogeny, function, and
therapeutic implications of oral-mucosal TRM. Considered amongst the most architecturally and biologically varied
tissue sites in the body, the mouth is continuously bombarded by myriad dietary and environmental antigens and
harbors diverse microbial communities. Moreover, the mouth and salivary glands can be colonized by bacterial,
fungal, and viral pathogens including herpes simplex virus and human papilloma virus. Given their well-
documented and critical functions in mediating barrier immunosurveillance in other NLT, oral TRM are likely to
play a major role in antiviral immunity and oral immune homeostasis. TRM may also perpetuate chronic immune
responses observed in periodontal disease and oral lichen planus. However, addressing their role in these
clinically relevant settings has suffered from a lack of animal models which would facilitate the generation of
sufficient oral TRM to manipulate and study. I have bridged this gap by developing a novel oral ‘prime-pull’
strategy, the first of its kind, for generating large quantities of tractable TRM in the oral mucosa. Leveraging this
innovative approach, I will address outstanding fundamental questions regarding oral TRM biology with
translational potential for human oral health. During the K99 phase, I will define the recruitment and retention
signals governing oral TRM with implications for depleting pathogenic subsets (Aim 1). Experiments spanning the
K99/R00 phases will investigate the consequences of oral TRM reactivation in shaping the microbial and
inflammatory landscape of the mouth with clinical relevance for recrudescent oral infections and oral cancer (Aim
2). Work conducted in the R00 phase will define the role of oral TRM in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, the most
common chronic inflammatory condition worldwide (Aim 3). In summary, work outlined in the proposal will pave
a path forward towards my goal of developing therapeutic interventions targeting oral TRM."
10893945,"The simple genetic cause of Huntington’s disease contrasts starkly with the vast number of pathways that are
affected by the mutation. Some of these pathway-level changes may persist even if the mutated allele of the
disease-causing gene (HTT) can be corrected through gene therapy or related methods. During the first granting
period, our analysis of HD models identified several potential therapeutic directions, including ones closely tied
to epigenetics (the transcriptional regulators NEUROD1, WNTand ELK-1), as well as pathways that interact with
epigenomic changes (energy metabolism and lipid biochemistry). Some of these effects were restricted to
particular cell types in the brain. We also found evidence that mutant HTT (mHTT) expression causes
neurodevelopmental impairments, changing the distribution of cell types in the brain. We and others have also
identified a significant number of genetic variants in the human population for which there is significant support
for an impact of that variant on HD age of onset (AOO).
In the current proposal, we examine the therapeutic potential of interventions based on these findings. We will
target these pathways in mice, measuring how interventions alter transcription, the epigenome, signaling and
metabolomics. A critical innovation is our use of single-cell and spatially resolved methods to examine how
responses to mHTT and therapeutics vary among different types of cells. Equally important, we will differentiate
specific cell types from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in vitro to examine cell-type specific effects in
human cells. Using an approach based in systems biology we will look for common pathways that are affected
by the genetic AOO modifiers, the candidates from our prior grant period and leads from the literature. Our
approach is highly innovative, as it uses cutting edge experimental methods with single-cell and spatial resolution
to reveal aspects of HD that cannot be detected in homogenates. We also computationally integrate multi-omic
data (genomics, epigenomics, transcripts, proteins and metabolites) from the individual cells and brain regions
to uncover therapeutic pathways. The research is highly significant, as it seeks to guide therapeutic discovery
for an invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. We expect that the impact of our work will extend beyond HD,
by providing a model for how to measure and model cell-type specific neurodegeneration to identify therapeutic
approaches."

 Falls are the leading cause of injuries in older adults. Prevention of fall injuries is a national public health
priority. To date, most of the studies on falls in older adults were conducted in non-Hispanic White populations
in urban areas. Little is known about the occurrence rates, circumstances and consequences of falls among
older adults living in rural and suburban neighborhoods, and among racial/ethnic minorities. To our knowledge,
no study on falls has examined how older adults’ space and time use differ in rural, suburban and urban
neighborhoods, and how such differences are related to risk of falling. To fill in this knowledge gap, this project
will investigate 1) the rural-urban, gender and racial/ethnic differences in time and space use and rates of
location- and activity-specific falls; 2) how time and space use influence risks for indoor and outdoor falls
among older adults living in urban, suburban and rural neighborhoods; and 3) what personal and
neighborhood-level factors are predictive of space and time use and location- and activity-specific falls. Using
the integrated data, 4) we will develop personalized prediction models for location- and activity-specific falls.
 We propose to establish a racially and ethnically diverse, gender-balanced longitudinal cohort of 1,252
adults age 65 years and older in Central Massachusetts, including 500 from urban, 500 from suburban and 252
from rural areas, and 600 (48%) non-Hispanic Whites and 652 (52%) racial/ethnic minorities (218 non-Hispanic
Blacks, 218 Hispanics and 216 Asians/other races). Participants will be followed every 6 months for 3 years to
track their falls, mobility, activity patterns, disability, health and health behaviors. Fall events will be tracked
using monthly falls calendars and follow-up telephone surveys if a fall occurs. Participant mobility patterns with
respect to space, frequency and duration will be measured using a global positioning system (GPS) unit, and
participant timing, frequency, duration and intensity of indoor and outdoor activities will be concurrently
measured using an accelerometer, at baseline, 6, 24 and 30 months. During the follow-up years 2 and 3,
participants will be followed using in-home visits, mail or telephone surveys twice a year querying their health
habits and health status. The GPS and accelerometer data will be integrated with the participant’s reported
health, perception and behavioral data as well as neighborhood environment data. These data will be
integrated and analyzed to achieve the above analytic goals.
 These study results will inform the design of community-based programs for promoting active living and
preventing falls that will be effective in both genders, among all racial/ethnic groups and across the rural-urban
continuum. Based on the personalized fall risk prediction models to be developed in this study, we will design
and test personalized (precision) falls prevention approaches in a subsequent randomized clinical trial study."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent group of neurodevelopmental disorders whose treatment
efficacy is limited by poor understanding of its causal molecular mechanisms. Identifying disease mechanisms
in ASD involves overcoming several challenges. First, it is difficult to demonstrate causality for a given
mutation, since many mutations increase risk but do not always produce ASD. Second, it is challenging to
identify animal models with autism-related phenotypes that are robust across multiple genetic backgrounds.
Third, limited understanding of the neuronal subtypes and circuits responsible for behavior is a barrier to
studying molecular mechanisms in a disease-relevant cellular context. The proposed research meets all three
of these challenges. In the F99 phase, human families with a highly penetrant form of recessive autism caused
by mutations in ACTL6B, a neuronal-specific subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, were
identified. Actl6b-/- mice were tested as a model for ACTL6B mutant ASD and found to exhibit autism-related
behaviors on two genetic backgrounds and similar brain anatomy to the affected humans. Transcriptional
analysis of Actl6b-/- cortical cultures indicated that neural activity-induced genes were de-repressed in the
absence of Actl6b, even when action potentials were blocked. The elevated expression of early response
genes, including AP1 transcription factors (e.g., Fos, Junb), in Actl6b-/- neurons was associated with increased
chromatin accessibility at AP1 sites and activity-related transcriptional changes in late-response genes,
implicating abnormal early response gene activation as a potential disease mechanism. The genomic
localization of the BAF complex, AP1 transcription factors, and the NCoR complex, which interacted with BAF
in cortical tissue, will be studied in wildtype and Actl6b-/- neurons to learn if altered targeting of these
complexes may contribute to disease-related transcriptional changes. To gain insight into the affected neuronal
circuitry, a serotonin receptor 1b (5HT1b) agonist that was shown to rescue social behavior in the 16p11
autism mouse model (PMID: 30089910) was tested and found to rescue social impairments in Actl6b-/- mice.
Serotonergic neuron-specific deletion of Arid1b, the most frequently mutated BAF subunit in autism, caused
social impairments in mice that could likewise be rescued with the 5HT1b agonist, indicating that BAF function
in serotonergic neurons is critical for social behavior. These studies have inspired the postdoctoral (K00)
research direction: to interrogate autism-related molecular mechanisms within neuronal populations that
control behavior. The postdoctoral training in systems neuroscience will buoy future studies linking the
functions of chromatin regulatory proteins directly to behavior. This research supports the missions of the
NIH Blueprint and BRAIN Initiative by providing new tools for autism research and revealing molecular and
circuit mechanisms that influence behavior."

ABSTRACT
the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, is a devastating neurodegenerative
disease. The hallmarks of this devastating disease are the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles, as revealed by standard histopathologic examination at postmortem. A large number of strides have
been made in past years to identify and validate biomarkers for AD. Based on PET and CSF measures of the
plaques and tangles of AD, we are now able to measure AD pathology in vivo at all stages: AD dementia, mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), and preclinical AD. Notably, the recent NIA/AA AT(N) research framework focused
on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living individuals and encouraged the continued development of new,
unrecognized AD biomarkers. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a relatively new protein-based MRI
technique that can generate contrast based on endogenous mobile proteins and peptides in tissue. Numerous
previous studies have demonstrated that APT-weighted (APTw) imaging can detect malignant brain tumors
based on increased cell density and acute cerebral ischemia due to tissue acidosis or decreased pH. Our effort
has successfully developed this important MRI technology into an FDA-approved sequence on Philips 3T MRI
systems for clinical use with brain cancer. Further translating this innovative protein-based technology to AD and
non-AD proteinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is encouraging. It is known that both
extracellular amyloid and intracellular tau first exist as soluble monomers (APT-detectable). Our preliminary
studies have clearly demonstrated that the abnormal accumulation of these proteins in MCI resulted in an
increased APT effect and AD dementia had APTw-MRI signal characteristics distinct from DLB. The overall
goals of this application are to refine quantitative whole-brain APT-MRI methodologies on 3T clinical MRI
scanners and to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of protein-based APT-MRI as a surrogate biomarker for
the characterization and diagnosis of AD and other forms of dementia, such as DLB. We have formulated three
specific aims that we plan to address in the coming five years: (i) develop a time-efficient APT-MRI protocol for
an imaging study of AD; (2) quantify the accuracy of APT-MRI in characterizing and diagnosing MCI; and (3)
quantify the accuracy of APT-MRI in distinguishing between AD dementia and DLB. This proof-of-concept study
will lay the foundation for a full validation study that will assess the impact of APT imaging on clinical
decision-making in patients with AD and related dementias."

Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has emerged as a significant global health concern, with
increasing incidence attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Additionally, individuals living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWH) face a higher risk of developing OPSCC. Understanding the synergistic relationships between
HIV and oral HPV infection in OPSCC development is critical for advancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
strategies. CD8+ T cells play a pivotal role in antiviral immunity and tumor surveillance. However, the impact of
HIV infection on CD8+ T cells remains largely unexplored. Recently, we have identified an HPV integration
hotspot in the PD-L1 gene, contributing to CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In addition, our single-cell analysis revealed
a unique subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells associated with HIV-HPV co-infection in the OPSCC
microenvironment. We hypothesize that HIV co-infection induces elevated dysfunction/exhaustion of tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8+ T cells, in the OPSCC microenvironment. As a multi-PI
application, combining our expertise in single-cell analysis and functional analysis of HIV mouse models and
CD8+ T cells, we will investigate the impact of HIV infection on the immune cell landscape of HPV-positive
OPSCC (Aim 1). Additionally, we will characterize the phenotype and specificity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell
receptors (TCRs) and correlate them with cellular exhaustion status in the context HIV-HPV co-infection (Aim 2).
Furthermore, we will establish a novel mouse model that faithfully recapitulates HIV-HPV co-infection in OPSCC
to explore dynamic interactions between viral infection, tumor progression, and CD8+ T cells (Aim 3). Additionally,
we will investigate the impact of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) and immune checkpoint blockade on
restoring tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell function and preventing HPV-induced neoplastic growth. This research
aims to enhance our understanding of HIV-HPV co-infection's influence on immune responses and immune
evasion in oropharyngeal cancer. Findings may inform novel therapeutic strategies to enhance immune
responses and improve clinical outcomes for OPSCC patients living with HIV and have broader implications for
other HPV-associated malignancies."

Subclinical (asymptomatic) malaria with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is common in children who live in moderate-
to-high transmission areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Although subclinical malaria may be submicroscopic, affected
school-age children (ages 8-15 years) often have positive blood smears that include millions of parasites per mL
of blood. While subclinical malaria is typically attributed to acquired adaptive immunity that tightly controls the Pf
biomass, patent parasitemia (blood smear+) exceeds any reasonable estimate of the pyrogenic threshold. How
is it possible to remain without fever and overt malaria symptoms with patent parasitemia? In contrast to
symptomatic malaria, temporally persistent (chronic) subclinical malaria seems to be maintained by a complex
balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cells. The scientific premise of this
proposal is that epigenetic modifications of innate immune cells, including blood monocytes (Mo), modulate
inflammatory pathways underlying subclinical malaria. Furthermore, we hypothesize that an immune
homeostasis network involving anti-inflammatory Pf-induced type 1 T regulatory cells (Tr1) and IL-10 as well as
enhanced IL-1RA production suppress innate immune inflammatory pathways. Subclinical malaria is of high
epidemiologic significance as parasitemia persists for months in schoolchildren who serve as the major reservoir
of gametocytes required to sustain Pf transmission to local anopheline vectors. Indeed, it is estimated that ~
60% of new mosquito infections can be attributed to this demographic. To test our hypotheses, we will enroll
Kenyan schoolchildren (ages 8-15) in a longitudinal cohort study to compare and analyze differences in immune
parameters between those with A) chronic subclinical malaria (Pf+ smear at baseline and who remain afebrile
despite repeatedly smear+ x 16 weeks) relative to B) children who develop febrile clinical malaria up to 2 weeks
after an afebrile Pf+ smear. The specificity of immune parameters for chronic Pf exposure in these cohorts will
be interrogated by comparison to age and sex matched children residing in a nearby highlands area where
malaria endemicity is ~ zero. PBMC and isolated Mo from children will be analyzed by RNA-seq to determine
activated gene expression pathways. We will define the differences in immune cell subsets, the transcription
factors that are activated and their effector cytokine expression profiles using mass cytometry (CyTOF). In
addition, we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNA sequencing to determine if the epigenomes of
children with chronic subclinical malaria are modified in order to silence proinflammatory genes or conversely,
to activate anti-inflammatory ones. Finally, we will identify and compare by Assay for Transposase-Accessible
Chromatin with high-throughput Sequencing (ATAC-seq) open chromatin sites in key gene expression pathways
in Mo from the comparator groups and align these regions with RNA-seq data from the same child. The
successful completion of this project should give us new and important insights as to the mechanism of
subclinical malaria and how this disease state can be modified to facilitate malaria eradication."

Preterm birth is the leading cause of childhood mortality and developmental disabilities and costs $26 billion
annually. A critical modifier of preterm infant health and development is maternal presence during the birth
hospitalization, which facilitates breast milk provision, participation in skin-to-skin care and allows mothers to
benefit from training in post-discharge infant care practices. However, these benefits can only be realized if
mothers are able to visit their hospitalized preterm infants for several hours per day, actively engage in
caregiving and receive training from staff during the many weeks of a typical preterm birth hospitalization.
Regularly visiting a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires mothers to shoulder significant costs, including
parking, childcare for other children, transportation, and accommodations, in addition to forgoing income.
Moreover, new evidence suggests that the psychological burden of financial strain may worsen mental health
outcomes (including stress and depression) and impede cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and
inhibitory control, which may further impede low-income mothers’ participation in NICU caregiving. Building on
a feasibility trial conducted by our team, we propose to conduct a 1:1 randomized control trial to rigorously test
the impact of financial transfers versus standard of care (control) among 420 low-income mothers with infants
25-33 weeks’ gestation in 3 level 3 NICUs (1 urban, 1 urban/suburban and 1 suburban/rural). Mothers in the
intervention arm will receive a transfer of $160 per hospital week with a one-time “label” or scripted message
that explains that the transfer is intended for them to visit and care for their hospitalized infant. Our primary
hypothesis is that financial transfers can enable economically disadvantaged families to visit the NICU, reduce
the negative psychological impacts of financial distress, increase maternal caregiving behaviors associated
with positive preterm infant health and development and potentially reduce health systems costs. In Aim 1, we
will examine the impact of financial transfers on primary NICU caregiving behaviors --breastmilk provision and
skin-to-skin care-- and secondary 1-2 month post-discharge caregiving behaviors-- safe sleep practices. In Aim
2, we will consider mechanisms of action, including mediators (NICU visitation, mental health, and cognitive
function) of the relationship between financial transfers and caregiving behaviors of interest. We will also
qualitatively explore maternal perspectives of financial transfers, mediators of its impact, and other barriers and
facilitators to maternal caregiving. In Aim 3, we will conduct exploratory analysis of cost drivers (length of stay,
30-day readmission and ED use). This simple and scalable intervention has tremendous potential to improve
equity in health care access by enabling key populations to utilize existing clinical supports during the NICU
hospitalization."

 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with significant morbidity and
mortality. In the previous period of this grant, we performed bulk RNA-seq and microRNA profiling of microCT
defined differentially affected lung regions. This work led to identification of numerous molecular targets and
insights, development of computational methods, and development of a transcriptional model of fibrosis
progression. Using the powerful high-resolution technologies of single cell profiling, we generated a ‘map’ of all
human cells in patients with IPF, discovered novel, ectopic and aberrant cell populations, and replacement of
the distal alveolar cellular content with cells that usually populate the airways. These exciting findings are
foundations of this renewal application that focuses on identification of the signals that drive the changes we
identified, their sequence and their spatial organization. The hypothesis underlying this application is that
the unique histopathologic features of IPF reflect a disruption in the homeostatic cellular networks in
alveolar niche, that activates an aberrant but coordinated repair process that leads to the proximalization
of the distal lung. To address this hypothesis, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts in lung
fibrosis, genomics, proteomics, computational biology, computer science, cell and molecular biology, statistics,
imaging, bioengineering, pathology, and bioinformatics that will perform the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To identify the specific sequence of changes in cell compositions and phenotypes during the
progression of fibrosis in the human IPF lung.
Specific Aim 2: To identify the changes in spatial relations, interactions, and connections between cellular
members of the fibrotic niche at different stages of fibrosis and progression of fibrosis.
Specific Aim 3: Generation of a systems biology model of human pulmonary fibrosis with a specific focus on
regulators of disease emergence and progression.
At the completion of this project, we will have a cell level, comprehensive transcriptional regulatory,
mechanistically relevant model of IPF based on the unique histological features of the disease. The model, the
discovered key regulatory modules and the accompanying data sharing, and dissemination tools will be useful
for understanding disease mechanisms and generation of novel, effective and precise therapeutic interventions."

In this revised R01 application we propose to characterize a novel mechanism underlying the control of apoptosis
by the mitochondrial enzyme GCDH, and to extend the development of small molecule GCDH inhibitors to treat
melanoma. In our preliminary results we discovered that addiction to GCDH activity is critical for cell survival in
melanoma, but not liver, breast or prostate tumor cells, a discovery that was confirmed in patient specimens
where inverse correlation between GCDH expression and survival is seen in melanoma. Our studies reveal
induction of apoptosis in melanoma cell lines following GCDH inhibition, a phenotype dependent on the upstream
DHTKD1 enzyme. Key in mediating GCDH activities in melanoma is NRF2, which is subjected to glutarylation
upon inhibition of GCDH. NRF2 glutarylation promotes its stability and transactivation of an apoptotic UPR
signaling consisting of ATF4, ATF3, CHOP and CHAC1, the latter being components of the Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR). Inhibition of GCDH effectively induces apoptotic UPR signaling in melanoma but not in liver
or breast cancer cells, substantiating the selectivity of the pathway as mapped in cell lines and patient tumor
samples. These observations provide the foundation for our hypothesis that GCDH-mediated regulation
of NRF2-UPR signaling constitutes a novel pathway controlling melanoma cell survival. Our studies will
(i) map the NRF2 glutarylation pathway in melanoma, generate antibodies specific to glutarylated NRF2, monitor
NRF2 glutarylation in specimens from melanoma patients both responsive and non-responsive to therapy (ii)
assess how GCDH impacts tumor development, progression and response to targeted and immuno therapy in
genetic mouse models. YUMM1.7, MaRas, B16F10 lines will be modified to express inducible KD of GCDH
before their inoculation into syngeneic WT or GCDH KO mouse models which will be monitored prior and
following therapy (iii) advance development GCDH inhibitors as novel therapeutic modalities. SBI-0690564 was
confirmed in vitro and in cultured melanoma cells, where it phenocopies genetic inactivation of GCDH and inhibits
melanoma tumors in mice. We will characterize and further develop a novel class of inhibitors to target GCDH
and determine their effectiveness in culture and in vivo using mouse models. Our studies will establish novel
paradigm for GCDH signaling as we define mechanisms underlying GCDH control melanoma tumor fate.
Understanding the addiction to GCDH in melanoma provides the foundation for the development and evaluation
of novel GCDH inhibitors to selectively target these and possibly other select cancers."

The overall goal of our project is to validate a diagnostic tool for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and
Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), two common neurodegenerative diseases affecting 1.4 million people in
the U.S. Currently, definitive diagnosis of DLB and PDD often requires the postmortem detection of disease-
associated alpha-synuclein (αSynD) aggregates in the brain. Clinically, DLB and PDD can be easily
misdiagnosed with other dementias and parkinsonisms such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and tauopathies. An
unmet medical need is to identify biomarkers for early and differential diagnosis of DLB and PDD in more easily
accessible tissues. We have taken advantage of the emerging technology known as the real-time quaking
induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to develop a robust platform for ultrasensitive detection of αSynD in
peripheral tissues. In preliminary studies, we are able to detect prion-like seeding activity of αSynD in the skin of
DLB and PD patients with 100% specificity and sensitivity. In addition, we were remarkably successful in
detecting αSynD seeding activity in multiple peripheral tissues including skin, sigmoid colon, and submandibular
glands in autopsied specimens. We hypothesize that RT-QuIC of peripheral αSynD is a highly sensitive and
robust diagnostic biomarker for premortem diagnoses of DLB and PDD. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to pursue the following four Aims: (1) Establish peripheral αSynD as a biomarker for postmortem diagnosis of
DLB and PDD using RT-QuIC assay; (2) Assess skin αSynD as a biomarker for premortem diagnosis of DLB and
PDD; (3) Determine peripheral αSynD and tau as a biomarker for differentiating DLB and PDD from other
dementias and parkinsonisms such as AD and tauopathies; (4) Explore gut αSynD as a biomarker for premortem
diagnosis of DLB and PDD using colon biopsy. Successful implementation of this proposal will establish RT-
QuIC assay utilization for early diagnosis of DLB and PDD using readily available peripheral specimens."

ILC2s are the dominant innate lymphoid cell population in the lungs at steady state and their release of type-2
cytokines is a central driver in responding eosinophil infiltration, increased airway hyperreactivity and associated
lung tissue injury. Previously, our laboratory identified a subset of ILC2s (ILC210s) that actively produce and
secrete IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine with the ability to ameliorate allergic lung inflammation signaling (J
Allergy Clin Immunol., 2020). Importantly, these results have been confirmed by other groups in a variety of
allergic disease models (J Exp Med., 2020, Immunity, 2021). The proposed research plan is motivated by
recent preliminary observations demonstrating that key molecular and transcriptional requirements may be
required for the induction of IL-10, with the potential for targeted modulation. SA1 is intended to explore the
regulation of transcription factors for the induction of IL-10. We propose a series of experiments in acute and
chronic models of allergic airway inflammation to assess the involvement of key transcription factors cMaf and
Blimp-1 first by expansive, cutting-edge chromatin sequencing methods, and next by retroviral induction and
knock-out mouse models. In SA2, we also observed that production of IL-10 relies significantly on key metabolic
pathways often utilized by ILC2s. We intend to expand our studies by investigating the role of glycolysis, fatty
acid oxidation and signaling protein AMPK, with the aim of identifying mechanistic targets for the potential
modulatory therapies for allergic disease. Additionally, mitochondrial regulation of IL-10 production with be
explored through in vitro and ex vivo mitochondrial dynamic assays. Finally, the two parts of this project come
together to address specific transcriptional and metabolic requirements for the modulation of pathogenic ILC2s
with the intention of targeted conversion to ILC210s with the ability to regulate airway hyperreactivity. The results
obtained from this study will provide novel insights into an important and understudied role of ILC210s in diseases
associated with ILC2s such as allergic lung inflammation and asthma."

Hypoglycemia is a dangerous complication of exogenous insulin therapy in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) that is treated
by exogenous glucagon secretion. However, the use of exogenous glucagon has its own side effects and can
be complicated to administer in an emergency situation. As an alternative, stimuli that lead to robust endogenous
glucagon secretion could be effective to counter severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon secretion can be stimulated by
amino acids, like alanine and arginine, as well as by glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).
Remarkably, we found that while alanine or GIP alone induce modest increases in glucagon secretion, the
combination of alanine and GIP synergistically increase glucagon secretion in both isolated mouse and human
islets, as well as mice in vivo. A better understanding of the physiology of this glucagon and the mechanism of
its release is needed to determine if stimulating endogenous glucagon can treat hypoglycemia in T1D. We
hypothesize that endogenous -cell stimuli, such as GIP + alanine, can counter insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
The aims of this project are designed to elucidate whether -cell stimuli can mitigate severe hypoglycemia, how
the effects of -cell stimulation are changed in T1D, and what is the mechanism that alanine stimulates the -
cell to secrete glucagon. Successful completion of this project will enhance our understanding of the -cell and
provide insight for the basis of therapeutics for hypoglycemia or insulin co-therapies. In addition, the aims will
broaden the Candidate’s technical expertise and develop conceptual understanding of -cell physiology that will
provide a foundation for a career as an independent investigator."

 Flux through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway is tightly controlled to ensure cells continuously synthesize
nonsterol isoprenoids but avoid overproducing cholesterol and other sterols. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-
localized HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate limiting enzyme in MVA pathway, is the focus of a complex
feedback regulatory system governed by sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. One mechanism for this control
involves sterol-induced ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Previous studies revealed that ERAD of HMGCR is
accelerated by two classes of sterols 1) methylated sterols such as the cholesterol synthesis intermediate 24,
25-dihydrolanosterol (DHL) and 2) oxysterols including 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC, but not DHL,
blocks proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), another Insig-mediated
reaction. HMGCR is the molecular target of statin drugs, long prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol; however,
statins block ERAD of HMGCR, causing its accumulation that blunts the drugs’ efficacy. This proposal aims to
gain mechanistic understanding for how sterols initiate HMGCR ERAD and provide insights on how targeting the
reaction can be harnessed to prevent statin resistance. Studies show the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester SRP3042
mimics sterols in accelerating HMGCR ERAD. Photoactivatable srpDHY, a derivative of SRP3042, specifically
crosslinks HMGCR, indicating sterols directly bind the enzyme to initiate ERAD. During the K99 phase of my
training, I will use cryo-EM to determine how SRP3042 accelerates HMGCR ERAD. In the R00 phase, I will
determine whether SRP3042 administered to mice can be used to block the statin-induced accumulation of
hepatic HMGCR by accelerating the protein’s ERAD as a viable strategy to augment statin therapy.
 Lipid homeostasis is maintained by the SREBP family of transcription factors which modulate expression
of enzymes required for lipid synthesis. Preliminary studies show the sterol-like molecule, LY295427 acts through
a unique unknown mechanism to block 25HC-mediated events. These include inhibition of transcriptional
regulation of LXR, regulation of acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity, and SREBP
cleavage. However, LY295427 does not reverse 25HC-medated HMGCR ERAD. My R00 studies will identify
the molecular target of LY295427 utilizing a variety of techniques including a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen,
genomic siRNA screen, and a biochemical approach coupling click chemistry and mass spectrometry. My
mentor, Dr. DeBose-Boyd (Professor of Molecular Genetics), employs a multi-disciplinary approach to explore
regulatory mechanisms, and fully supports collaborative opportunities that will ensure my transition away from
his interests. I have assembled a strong, scientifically diverse mentoring committee to aid my transition to
independence. Completion of these studies will reveal novel lipid sensing pathways that can be harnessed for
development of regulatory molecules for diseases associated with lipid dysregulation. Moreover, they will provide
strong preliminary data for a future R01 application that will enhance my transition into an independent scientist."
10867330,"Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a new psychiatric disorder in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-5). ARFID has an estimated prevalence of 7.2 to 17.4 percent thus making it a
significant mental health concern. ARFID is characterized by a range of dysfunctional eating behaviors including
a lack of interest in eating, sensory related eating concerns (such as taste, color or texture) and a fear of adverse
consequences of eating (i.e., fear of choking or vomiting). There is no evidence-based treatment for ARFID.
Preliminary data from a feasibility study comparing FBT-ARFID to Usual Care (UC) provide evidence that
manualized FBT adapted for patients with ARFID is feasible and effective. Recruitment and randomization
averaged 1.87 participants per month over a 15 month period with an overall attrition rate of 21%, comparable
to rates in fully powered studies of FBT-AN. The feasibility study also identified an efficacy signal on the
difference between groups on the primary outcome (change in percent Estimated Body Weight (%EBW)) of a
large effect size (ES) favoring FBT-ARFID Studies suggest that improvements in parental self-efficacy related to
changing feeding and eating behaviors early in treatment is a likely mechanism of FBT for other eating disorders
in youth. Our feasibility study showed a striking difference between conditions in parental self-efficacy favoring
FBT-ARFID compared to UC. In addition to this promising evidence of target engagement In addition, target
validation was demonstrated by the change in parental self-efficacy being significantly correlated with
improvements in % EBW. Aim 1: To conduct an RCT involving children and adolescents between the ages of 6
and 12 years of age with DSM 5 ARFID and weight below 88% of EBW comparing FBT-ARFID with medical
management to manualized Non-Specific Treatment UC with medical management. Treatments will be matched
for time and therapist attention. We hypothesize that participants randomized to FBT-ARFID will have
significantly greater change in %EBW at EOT. Aim 2: To examine early change in parental self-efficacy as a
mediator of treatment effect (FBT-ARFID vs. UC on outcome). We hypothesize that positive changes due to
FBT-ARFID in parental self-efficacy related to feeding behaviors using the Parents vs ARFID Scale (PvsARFID)
will be associated with positive changes in %EBW at EOT. Secondarily, we will explore whether objective
changes in parental re-feeding behavior is a possible mechanism of FBT-ARFID using a mediator analysis. Aim
3: To explore moderators of treatment outcome. To conduct an adequately powered study, 100 children (ages
6-12 years) will be randomized to manualized FBT-ARFID plus medical management (n=50) or manualized Non-
Specific Treatment plus medical management (n=50). Assessments (blinded to treatment condition) of primary
and secondary outcomes will be conducted at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 4 months (EOT)."
10867289,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common among women Veterans (WVs), with nearly 20% of
WVs treated in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care clinics experiencing past-year IPV. VHA’s
Women’s Health Services (WHS), the IPV Assistance Program, and the Offices of Primary Care and Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention developed recommendations for implementing IPV screening programs in
primary care. More than two-thirds of WV primary care patients receive care in “Model 1” (i.e., mixed-gender
primary care) and “Model 2” (i.e., separate but shared space) clinics, but uptake of screening is low in these
clinics. WHS therefore plans to use Blended Facilitation (BF) to roll out IPV screening programs in Model 1 and
Model 2 primary care clinics. Given the high number of these clinics throughout VHA, it is unclear whether
resource-intensive BF is feasible and whether a less intensive strategy (i.e., toolkit + Implementation as Usual
[IAU]) can be effective. Research is also needed on the clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs.
Significance/Impact: Given the high prevalence of IPV among WVs and its significant health effects,
successful implementation of IPV screening programs is expected to improve healthcare services and reduce
morbidity among WV VHA patients, an HSR&D priority area.
Innovation: This study will be the most comprehensive evaluation of both the implementation impact and
clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs globally. It is innovative in its inclusion of four strong VHA
operations partners dedicated to successful implementation of IPV screening programs. This project
capitalizes on a time-sensitive opportunity to advance IPV screening programs and implementation science.
Specific Aims: This objective of this proposal is to comprehensively evaluate two strategies for implementing
IPV screening programs through achieving three specific aims. (1) Evaluate the degree of reach, adoption,
implementation fidelity, and maintenance achieved using two implementation strategies for IPV screening
programs. (2) Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of IPV screening programs, as evidenced by disclosure rates
and post-screening psychosocial service use. (3) Identify multi-level barriers to and facilitators of IPV screening
program implementation and sustainment.
Methodology: We propose a cluster randomized, stepped wedge, Hybrid Type II program evaluation design to
compare the impact of two implementation strategies (BF + toolkit vs. toolkit + IAU) and the clinical
effectiveness of IPV screening programs. We propose a mixed methods approach to collect quantitative
(clinical records data) and qualitative (key informant interviews) implementation outcomes (Aims 1 and 3), as
well as quantitative (clinical records data) clinical effectiveness outcomes (Aim 2). We will supplement these
data collection methods with surveys to assess implementation strategies survey to be completed pre-BF,
post-BF, and in the maintenance phase. The integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in
Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will guide the qualitative data collection and analysis. Summative data
will be analyzed using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our four VHA operations partners are eager to use our study results to inform
future implementation strategies and clinical practices to spread IPV screening programs to all VHA primary
care clinics and other clinical settings so that this vital intervention is accessible to all WV VHA patients."

In high burden countries, many patients with tuberculosis (TB) are never diagnosed or treated with effective drug
regimens, leading to ongoing transmission and increased mortality. A primary reason is that current TB
diagnostics are inadequate with key issues including inadequate sensitivity, high costs, inability to be used at
lower levels of the health system and/or failure to identify drug resistance. No single test is likely to address all
these limitations and therefore the World Health Organization (WHO) has described optimal test characteristics
for different use-cases in the form of target product profiles (TPPs). To advance novel solutions for high priority
TPPs, identifying promising technologies and linking their developers to experienced clinical study sites to
facilitate evaluation and performance feedback is essential.
The overall goal of the Rapid Research in Diagnostics Development for TB Network (R2D2 TB Network)
is to address the critical unmet need for better TB diagnostics in order to close the “diagnostic gap” and
thereby improve patient and public health outcomes. To achieve this goal, the R2D2 TB Network will solicit,
review and prioritize the most relevant novel TB diagnostics across different phases of development and
across different use cases for evaluation during the award period (Objective 1). We will leverage our
partnership with a biotech incubator to bring in technology innovators not already working in the TB field and
with a key NGO that has been a leader in developing the current TB diagnostics pipeline. Clinical studies to
assess accuracy and usability of tests in earlier phases of development will allow for iterative test optimization
(Objective 2). These studies will be nested, where possible, within large-scale, multi-center assessments of the
accuracy and usability of design-locked diagnostics to facilitate WHO policy review (Objective 3). The clinical
studies will rigorously follow WHO guidance for specific use-cases as well as general guidelines for high-
quality diagnostic evaluations. For design-locked diagnostics, we will complement the clinical studies with
assessments of incremental value through empirical costing, health economic and transmission modeling
studies (Objective 4) to further support WHO- and country-level policy reviews.
To accomplish these objectives, the R2D2 TB Network brings together investigators with a broad range of
relevant expertise related to TB diagnostic research and 12 experienced clinical study sites in 10 high-burden
countries that provide access to relevant populations for evaluating TB diagnostics. The PIs overseeing the
network have deep expertise in coordination of multi-center studies, a demonstrated history of working with a
broad range of product developers, experience in the review and endorsement practices of the WHO and
regulatory authorities, and more than a decade of collaborative leadership experience. By fostering and
supporting a strong, collaborative network of investigators, product developers and stakeholders across
diverse geographic sites, the R2D2 TB Network will advance the next-generation of TB diagnostics."

Auditory stimuli travel from the cochlea to the brainstem through type I and type II cochlear afferents. While
type I afferents convey information about the frequency, intensity, and timing of sounds, the role of type II
afferents remains unresolved. Limited recordings of type II afferents from the cochlear apex in pre-hearing rats
reveal that they can be activated by widespread outer hair cell (OHC) stimulation and by ATP released by
acute tissue damage. Secondly, synaptic activity in type II fibers has been shown to be glutamatergic but input
from multiple OHCs is required to initiate action potential firing. A recent study suggests that type II afferents
respond to non-damaging sound, via their glutamatergic pathway. Additionally, type II fibers exhibit properties
similar to pain fibers, for example the expression of modulatory peptidergic and cannabinoid signaling
pathways. Finally, type II fibers express receptor genes to inflammatory modulators, some of which are
upregulated after noise exposure. These combined data suggest that type II afferents may sense non-
damaging and damaging sound levels, and that multiple parallel pathways may contribute to the type II fiber
response to different degrees, depending on history of sound exposure. To explore this hypothesis, we have
developed Ca2+-imaging techniques that reveal type II fiber activity throughout the cochlear coil, from apex to
base, of adult mice. Secondly, we propose to use loose patch recordings of type II afferent fibers to monitor
firing rates in response to optogenetic stimulation of OHCs. Both approaches are utilized to determine the
impact of non- damaging and damaging sound exposure on the activity of type II cochlear afferents. The goal
of this proposal is to understand the contribution of multiple pathways (purinergic, glutamatergic,
neuromodulatory and inflammatory) to these conditions. Our recent experiments show sensitization in the type
II afferent response following noise exposure. Such sensitization might be reflective of a `gain-of-function
pathology' like hyperacusis/noxacusis. The proposed comprehensive approach here aims to identify
pharmacotherapeutic targets for such gain of function pathologies that can follow noise exposure and noise-
induced hearing loss."

Early psychosis intervention is critical to improving clinical and functional outcomes, yet treatment initiation is
typically delayed for months to years, resulting in severe and long-term impairment. Online self-screening has
emerged as a powerful tool capable of exponentially increasing the reach of effective early identification efforts,
however most youth searching for mental health information online do not expeditiously advance towards care.
For instance, over 100,000 youth between the ages of 13-26 screen above threshold for psychosis-risk annually
via The Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ-B), available on Mental Health America’s (MHA) national online screening
platform, warranting a thorough clinical evaluation. However, only 17.1% subsequently state an intention to seek
care, and under 1% proceed to initiate one of MHA’s recommended professionally delivered digital supports,
representing a critical limitation to existing online psychosis screening efforts. In collaboration with MHA, the
world’s largest mental health screening and advocacy organization, and Strong365, an online resource hub
dedicated to early psychosis awareness and care navigation, this R01 proposal aims to develop a Digital
Laboratory focused on advancing help-seeking in youth at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for developing psychosis
from self-directed online screening towards treatment initiation. Qualified youth with CHR will be referred to AMP-
SCZ, a NIH funded national network of clinical and research programs across the US. We will begin by
characterizing help-seeking subtypes based on the Health Action Process Approach Model (HAPA) in 25,000
youth who score above PQ-B threshold on MHA’s screening platform (Aim 1). Next, leveraging this large and
unique dataset, we will establish the PQ-B threshold score most effective at identifying CHR youth in an online
environment, thus reducing the risk of false positives, given that optimal threshold values can vary depending
upon case mix and setting (Aim 2). Last, using a series of Micro Randomized Trials (MRTs) in 25,000 youth who
score positive for psychosis risk, followed by a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) with
another 1,000 youth, we will iteratively develop and test the effectiveness of data and theory driven help-seeking
advancement strategies, designed to facilitate the transition from online information seeking at baseline to action,
and determine the most effective strategies to maintain help-seeking at critical timepoints when youth are most
likely to disengage (Aim 3). Further, through the proposed incorporation of Strong365’s provider interaction tools
(text and video chat) directly into MHA’s website, designed to support and assess youth who score above PQ-B
threshold, we will leverage Natural Language Processing to determine if text data carries important information
related to advancement patterns and further develop targeted help-seeking advancement strategies to be tested
through MRTs. Our platform would provide an innovative and scalable agile solution to address a major public
health challenge by reaching youth earlier in the course of serious mental illness development, screening large
volumes of youth for psychosis-risk online and advancing help-seeking trajectories towards care."
10881371,"TITLE: Role of Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein-C in the Regulation of Myocardial Contraction
ABSTRACT: The overall goal of this project is to understand how cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C)
regulates heart muscle contraction and relaxation. cMyBP-C is a critical regulator of cardiac function, with
dysfunction of cMyBP-C commonly occurring in heart failure and mutations in cMyBP-C being the most common
genetic cause of HCM. However, the regulatory effects of cMyBP-C are complex and most likely involve dynamic
interactions with both thick (myosin containing) and thin (actin containing) filaments, making it challenging to sort
out what are likely to be reciprocal or interrelated effects of cMyBP-C on each filament. To overcome these and
other challenges, we recently developed a novel method that allows us to rapidly remove and replace (“cut and
paste”) cMyBP-C at its endogenous position in sarcomeres, thus affording us the opportunity to quickly test
cMyBP-C effects on both filament systems. In Aim 1 we will test the functional significance of the “middle
domains” of cMyBP-C which were recently implicated as regulators of thick filament relaxation by stabilizing the
“interacting heads motif” conformation of myosin on the thick filament as well as novel regulators of cMyBP-C
function including Ca2+-Calmodulin (CaM) that we show in exciting new preliminary data may regulate cMyBP-C
binding to the thin filament. Because HCM mutations and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) also occur in
the middle domains and have been correlated with diastolic dysfunction we will also test effects of selected
mutations and PTMs in these domains. Experiments will include measurements of steady state force in
permeabilized cardiomyocytes as well as rates of activation and relaxation in myofibrils and the activation state
of thick filaments determined by myosin DRX/SRX ratios. In Aim 2 we will use the cut and paste approach
combined with X-ray diffraction to determine structural effects of cMyBP-C on the activation/relaxation states of
thick and thin filaments in sarcomeres. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that C-links between thick and
thin filaments modulate the on/off states of thick and thin filaments and contribute to thick filament activation in
response to passive stretch or active load. Results from these studies will provide new insights into how cMyBP-
C regulates heart function during health and disease."

Primary care is the first point of contact for most people experiencing cognitive concerns, and its providers are
a critical workforce for dementia care. Timely and equitable diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) in primary care is a key national priority and enables primary care providers (PCPs) to
identify treatment opportunities and to support patients and their caregivers in planning ahead and making
decisions about safety, medications, management of comorbid conditions, and caregiving. Yet, missed and
delayed diagnosis of ADRD in primary care is a persistent problem, occurring in over 60% of affected persons,
impeding these key care functions, and is especially common among racial/ethnic minorities and
socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Early, equitable detection and diagnosis in primary care will be
crucial as new disease-modifying therapies become available, but workforce studies indicate that there are
insufficient specialists to make these diagnoses, especially in low-resource settings. Therefore, the overall goal
of this project is to build on strengths and overcome barriers in the primary care workforce that contribute to
missed and delayed diagnosis of ADRD, particularly among patients impacted by health disparities.
To do so, this study will take place in 7 primary care practices (safety net, community, academic) that serve
diverse populations in both urban and rural locations. We will use comparative ethnography to ascertain how
the most efficacious PCPs do successfully and proactively identify and diagnose dementia in diverse primary
care settings, and we will also identify drivers of disparities and barriers to timely diagnosis. Comparative
ethnography, an innovative lens we will bring to this persistent health system challenge, is a qualitative
approach used to holistically determine how social and cultural processes and individual and structural
contexts impact healthcare. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Assess the diagnostic journeys of people with ADRD
across diverse clinical settings and analyze their interactions with the primary care workforce to identify ways
social, cultural, and structural contexts impact the ADRD diagnostic process; (2) Analyze how PCPs, their
practice cultures, and available resources across these contexts strengthen or impede the ADRD diagnostic
process; and (3) a) Identify systems and policy-level factors that impact the ADRD diagnostic process, b)
Triangulate and compare findings across sites and domains, and c) Develop intervention targets, towards
future translation. We will identify how patient/caregiver factors, clinician and practice culture, and policies and
health systems strengthen or impede PCP engagement in the ADRD diagnostic process. A Stakeholder
Advisory Board will partner with the research team to help identify intervention targets for future studies.
The results will inform development of practice and policy intervention targets to achieve equitable workforce
management and outcomes for the growing population of older adults with cognitive decline. These will be
testable in future interventions to improve the primary care workforce’s approach to ADRD diagnosis."
10881534,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more school days, make up 13%-16% of public
school students and are disproportionately from marginalized populations such as low-income, non-English
speaking, Black, Latinx, and students with disabilities. Chronically absent students experience more chronic
illnesses, like asthma and obesity; are more likely to have behavioral health problems like depression and
substance use; and are less likely to graduate from high school, which is a key social determinant of lifelong
morbidity and mortality. school-based health centers (SBHCs) may improve health equity for students with
chronic absenteeism by reducing barriers to accessing care, addressing the specific health conditions
associated with chronic absenteeism, avoiding the need to miss school to access healthcare and ultimately
improving academic outcomes like attendance, grade point average, and graduation rates. However, few
studies characterize healthcare utilization and diagnoses for students with chronic absenteeism, or whether
SBHC use increases primary care utilization, reduces emergency and inpatient care, and improves academic
outcomes. We propose a 5-year study to determine whether SBHCs improve healthcare utilization and
academic outcomes for students with chronic absenteeism. We capitalize on unique partnerships in Los
Angeles with one of the largest managed care organizations (Kaiser Permanente Southern California, KPSC),
Medicaid insurance plans (LA Care), and the 2nd-largest school district in the nation (LAUSD), serving
~500,000 students a year. We propose to A) link electronic health and billing data from community clinics,
managed care organizations, and 25 SBHCs in LAUSD with school district demographic and academic
measures from 2015-2025. Using this unique dataset, we will B) identify children with different patterns of
chronic absenteeism and characterize their diagnoses and C) healthcare utilization, so that we can better
identify pediatric populations at high-risk for unmet health needs and tailor health services, such as SBHCs, to
meet their needs. We will then D) test whether students in high absenteeism classes who access SBHCs have
reduced emergency department visits (primary outcome) and hospitalizations, increased utilization of primary
care, and improved academic performance (attendance, grade point average, and graduation rates) compared
to a propensity weighted sample of chronically absent students who access community clinics or a managed
care organization alone. Finally, we will use the results of our analyses to engage students with chronic
absenteeism in a human centered design process to identify and prototype SBHC interventions, including the
expansion of or integration of SBHCs with other health systems, to improve care for children with chronic
absenteeism. This study examines whether SBHCs can improve health equity for an important marginalized
population and is aligned with NIMHD’s mission to improve minority health and reduce health disparities."
10881535,"Project Summary/Abstract
Medical misinformation is a global health problem with 73% of US adults having been exposed to false health
information and 87% expressing concern about it. Health misinformation can hijack a patient’s typical
discernment faculties and can lead to poor health outcomes. Evidence shows that elderly patients are
disproportionately affected by health misinformation and are more likely to believe and spread misinformation,
and suffer negative consequences. Engaging physicians has been touted as a promising and plausible means
to mitigate misinformation because they are highly trusted, routinely provide reliable medical information, and
are effective at influencing sustainable behavior change. Yet there is virtually no empirical data about physician
misinformation corrective practices. Physician practices to correct patient misinformation is likely to depend on
their political and religious beliefs as seen in other health areas, familiarity with the topic, correction and
communication skills, self-efficacy, and environmental (e.g., time) and interpersonal factors (e.g., exhaustion).
Prior to developing scalable and evidence-based physician communication interventions, a rich assessment of
factors that facilitate or impede physician corrective practices is needed. We use a mixed-methods approach to
identify factors and the strength of association among barriers/facilitators and physician willingness to correct
misinformation through three specific aims using two divergent cases: unproven stem cell therapies and Covid-
19 vaccination. In Aim 1, we will interview primary care physicians to assess knowledge, experience, attitudes,
and beliefs about correcting misinformation. In Aim 2, we will create a novel Determinants of Willingness to
Correct Misinformation (DWCM) measure based on Aim 1 qualitative data, expert review, cognitive interviews,
and psychometrically evaluate dimensionality and internal consistency. A national survey of physicians using
the validated DWCM instrument will be conducted to measure determinants that impact physician corrective
practices and attitudes towards adopting a priori correction strategies in their practice. In Aim 3, we will conduct
online asynchronous focus groups with elderly patients across the US to assess receptivity towards corrective
information from physicians, communication comprehension, channel preferences, and affect towards
receiving corrective information and the use of specific terminology. Upon completing this research, we will
have (i) identified major factors and their association with physician misinformation corrective practices and
their attitudes towards adopting corrective strategies; (ii) created a valid DWCM climate instrument that can be
deployed in different health care environments; (iii) offered data into patient receptivity towards receiving
corrective information from physicians, including modes of exchange and appropriate language, and (iv) be
well-positioned to develop and test the efficacy of a misinformation correction toolkit for physicians in future
research."
10875254,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The resurgence of severe invasive Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in the past decade
is a major public health concern in the United States, and gaps in understanding the resilience
of GAS to the immune response has impeded the development of a much-needed vaccine. The
long-term goal is to understand GAS survival and persistence in macrophages to provide a cell-
targeted basis for improved treatment for infection. Toward the long-term goal, the objective in
this application is to examine macrophage second-line responses to GAS following the failure of
lysosomes to eliminate bacteria. The central hypothesis is that GAS-induced lysosomal
permeabilization enables bacterial and lysosomal proteins to enter the cytosol, which continues
to alter macrophage cellular processes, including limiting the oxidative burst response and
inducing histone release and non-lytic exocytosis of GAS. Guided by preliminary data produced
by the applicant’s laboratory, this hypothesis will be explored in three specific aims. The work in
Aim 1 will determine whether GAS NADase in the cytosol impairs the oxidative burst response.
Measurements of reactive oxygen species, cellular energy pools, and NADPH oxidase complex
assembly will determine whether this bacterial enzyme negatively impacts the macrophage
oxidative burst response. Aim 2 will explore whether GAS-induced damage of the nuclear
envelope causes DNA-free histone release and the extent to which these histones have
antimicrobial activity against GAS in the macrophage cytosol. Preliminary data demonstrate that
macrophages expel GAS in exosomes and the work in Aim 3 will characterize these GAS-
containing exosomes. Time-lapse microscopic observations will be complemented by electron
microscopy and proteomics analyses of isolated exosomes. The outcome of this work will inform
approaches aimed at restoring or enhancing host cell function, which both avoids the problems
of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and enhances the natural ability of macrophages to
eradicate GAS. The proposed research is innovative because understanding these second-line
responses, which are intermediate processes between lysosomal failure and disease pathology,
will provide new druggable target proteins and pathways. The contribution will be a significant
first step toward developing pharmacological strategies that prevent, rather than treat severe
invasive disease and refractory infections."
10877765,"Community Engagement Core (CEC) Summary
Community engagement is central to the goals of the Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research
Program (CUNP-SRP), which seeks to reduce exposure to arsenic (As), uranium (U), and other metals through
systems science, traditional knowledge, and technology innovation. Tribal communities, similar to other rural
communities, are disproportionately exposed to As and U in groundwater from anthropogenic and geogenic
sources. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the CUNP-SRP will partner with tribal communities in
North and South Dakota affected by toxic elements in drinking water. The main objectives of the CEC are to
mitigate exposure to metals in drinking water and prevent related health outcomes through bidirectional and
participatory community engagement, advocacy, citizen science, capacity building, and impact evaluation. The
CEC builds upon a strong collaboration between Columbia University, Missouri Breaks Industries Research, Inc.
(MBIRI), and the Strong Heart Study (SHS). MBIRI is a Native American-owned research firm that has partnered
with tribal nations for 25 years and is centrally located in South Dakota. The SHS is a prospective cohort study
of cardiometabolic disease and its risk factors in Native American populations, ongoing since 1989. The
objectives of the CUNP-SRP CEC will engage all Project scientists and local community members to: (1)
integrate the Northern Plains perspective of diverse tribal and rural community members into all CUNP-SRP
activities (through a Community Advisory Committee, tribal research symposia, and communication portfolio);
(2) provide outreach and education to support evidence-based approaches for improving drinking water quality
in the Northern Plains (including enhanced remediation technology developed by Project 5); and (3) prevent
metal-related cardiometabolic outcomes through nutritional interventions (informed by Projects 3 and 4). To
achieve these aims, we will leverage established partnerships with diverse and multi-tiered stakeholders across
tribal communities including tribal and government partners involved in resources and environment, high school
students and teachers, tribal officials and elders, and community members. The CEC focuses on a community
that is engaged and integrated in all Projects, helping collect water samples and identifying safe drinking water
resources (Projects 1, 2, and 3), understanding the health risks (Projects 3 and 4), implementing prevention
strategies (Projects 1, 3, and 4), adapting novel remediation strategies (Project 5), and providing hands-on
opportunities for SRP trainees and local community members. The CEC will also leverage strong partnerships
with other SRP centers that strive to improve public health in Indigenous communities and other rural
environments. With a commitment to safeguarding tribal sovereignty and the right of citizens and communities
to participate as equal partners in the scientific process, the CEC will play a major role in mitigating groundwater
metal exposures and related disease in Northern Plains tribal communities, making drinking water safer and
promoting healthy traditional diets that improve nutritional status and can prevent cardiometabolic disease."

The Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program (CUNP-SRP)’s mission is to advance
science and technology to improve water quality and mitigate metal-related health effects in tribal communities
in the Northern Plains and other rural and suburban communities affected by groundwater contaminants,
including those near Superfund sites and abandoned mines. The CUNP-SRP research Projects and Cores use
systems science, local community knowledge, and cross-cutting technologies to provide an ideal framework for
interdisciplinary research and training. Leveraging these CUNP-SRP opportunities, the Research Experience
and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) will train a diverse group of future leaders who can traverse biomedical
and earth sciences research to accelerate innovation, incorporate community input, and improve public health
through the following aims. (1) Provide rigorous training in disciplinary, interdisciplinary, participatory, and
translational research through a shared curriculum that includes Indigenous research ethics, exposure science,
data science, and teamwork. Trainees will work with the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) and
Project scientists to analyze high-dimensional data using contemporary statistical approaches following
comprehensive training in participatory research ethics. (2) Enable hands-on skills that underscore real-world
applications of the trainees’ field and laboratory research through their participation in Community Engagement
Core and research translation activities, including opportunities to work with tribal organizations and communities
to mitigate water contaminants and related health effects. (3) Develop leadership skills to prepare trainees for
successful and diverse careers, enabling them to take ownership of several CUNP-SRP aspects including
seminar speaker selection, journal club organization, mentoring high school students from the Northern Plains,
and development of their own scientific and creative initiatives. (4) Promote diversity in environmental health,
earth sciences, and engineering by recruiting and supporting graduate and postgraduate trainees of diverse
backgrounds and perspectives into the RETCC, including candidates who are Native Americans. RETCC
Leaders and CUNP-SRP investigators will engage in departmental admission committees to review candidates
as well as in recruitment efforts, including networking with Northern Plains colleges, to encourage and support
eligible students to apply to our programs. The RETCC is designed to unite trainees (typically 15 trainees at any
given time, including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars) from across Columbia University’s Mailman
School of Public Health and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory to provide interdisciplinary training in public
health, medicine, earth sciences, and engineering. Successful accomplishment of the proposed aims will yield
alumni who are proficient in their chosen disciplines and in interdisciplinary research, with real-world
perspectives, a strong set of practical skills, respect for communities, and leadership qualities that will enable
them to launch their careers as successful environmental health and earth scientists and engineers."

Postpartum depressive (PPD) symptoms are common among women following the birth of a child and can
adversely impact a mother's ability to care for her child. As a result, infants of mothers with PPD symptoms
may experience less responsive parenting, placing them at greater risk for delays in development. Evidence-
based parenting programs have been developed to guide mothers with caring for their infants but may not
address the impact of depression on parenting, are intensive and expensive to administer with limited ability for
scale up, or are not available in a format that facilitates participation by women with depressive symptoms.
Therefore, these women may not be able to take advantage of the benefits of parenting programs. Our long-
term goal is to develop effective parenting strategies to facilitate optimal child development for mothers
suffering with PPD symptoms. Our overall objective for this application is to study whether this program
combined with online depression treatment leads to more responsive parenting (target) and signals improved
child language, socioemotional and cognitive development (outcomes) compared to depression treatment
alone. The specific aims are 1) to determine whether a social media-based parenting program can improve
responsive parenting (target) among mothers with PPD symptoms, 2) to determine whether a social media-
based parenting program can improve responsive parenting (target) and signal greater child development
(outcome) among mothers with PPD symptoms, and 3) to explore mediators and moderators of the effects of
the parenting program on responsive parenting. The proposed study will occur at 3-4 primary care practices
affiliated with a large urban children's hospital and consist of 2 phases: an initial pilot RCT testing engagement
of the parenting program on responsive parenting (R61) and a subsequent RCT further testing engagement of
the program and exploring child development and mediators and moderators of treatment effect (R33). In the
first phase, 75 ethnically and racially diverse women who screen positive for PPD symptoms and have infants
<6 months of age will be randomized to receive the parenting program plus online depression treatment or
online depression treatment alone to assess target engagement. In the second phase, an additional 75 eligible
women will be randomized to receive the parenting program plus online depression treatment or depression
treatment alone. In this latter phase, we will further determine whether the parenting program effectively
engages the proposed target, responsive parenting, and signals greater child developmental status than the
online depression treatment program. In addition, we will explore mediators and moderators of treatment
effects on responsive parenting. The results of this application would be expected to contribute important new
knowledge and inform a future trial on parenting strategies to better assist mothers with PPD symptoms and

The immunogenicity of nanomaterials is directly related to their performance and toxicity. However, there is still
a lack of systematic studies of how nanomaterials interact with the immune system. In this work, we will focus
on the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Various studies have raised concerns about the adverse
event of LNPs from PEG lipids, ionizable lipids, and even helper phospholipids, such as anti-polyethylene glycol
(PEG) antibodies found in BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines. During our recent studies of LNP-
based mRNA cancer vaccines, the side effects, including ulcerative dermatitis, were also found on vaccinated
mice after subcutaneous administrations. Most studies of LNPs via screening or design today have mainly
focused on LNP efficacy while few on LNP immunogenicity. Very limited human data on very limited formulations
in the context of COVID-19 vaccines following intramuscular administration have very limited scope in
immunogenicity such as accessing the overall outcome of immunogenicity only. The investigations have not
extensively delved into the underlying causes of the widely reported adverse effects associated with LNP-based
mRNA vaccines, the specific immunological pathways of immunogenicity, and the underlying relationship
between immunogenicity and components of LNPs. Currently, the mechanism of how LNPs induce adverse
events is yet to be fully understood. Here we will formulate three libraries of LNPs covering widely used lipids
and vary chemical properties of each component. We will perform immunological assays on primary murine cells
to evaluate cytokine secretion and profile inducible gene expression. Similar tests will be performed in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD-like receptor (NLR)-dependent
immune response will be evaluated by reporter assays and validated in deficient mouse primary cells.
Furthermore, the immunogenicity of LNPs will be profiled in the setting of intramuscular injections by assessing
local inflammatory responses at the injection sites, and intravenous injections by evaluating the systemic
response including accelerated blood clearance effects. Through these studies, we will identify key components
that are responsible for LNP immunogenicity, understand how the chemistry of each LNP component alters the
level of immune activation, and discover any synergistic effects on the immunogenicity among the components.
The success of this work will advance current LNP technologies and provide clinical benefits for applications
from vaccines to therapeutics."

The current ADA/EASD recommendation for glucose control in newly diagnosed T2DM patients
who are free from CVD and renal disease is to start on metformin and sequentially add other
glucose lowering agents upon metformin failure to maintain HbA1c <7.0%. The recently
completed GRADE study, which had tested the efficacy of 4 glucose lowering agents (sitagliptin,
glimepiride, liraglutide and glargine insulin) in maintaining the treatment goal in metformin failing
T2DM patients, has demonstrated that the vast majority (67-75%) failed to maintain the treatment
goal at 5 years, suggesting of inability of sequential add on approach on maintaining durable
reduction in the HbA1c.
Initial combination therapy is an alternative therapeutic approach for glucose control in T2DM
patients. The VERIFY study has demonstrated that subjects initiated on combination of metformin
plus vildagliptin had 26% lower failure rate than subjects started on metformin and had vildagliptin
added in metformin-failing subjects. Nonetheless, 43% of subjects receiving initial combination of
metformin plus vildagliptin failed to maintain HbA1c <7.0% at 5 years.
We have demonstrated in EDICT study that, initial combination therapy with agents that correct
known pathophysiologic defects present in T2DM will produce durable reduction in the HbA1c.
Initial combination with pioglitazone plus exenatide BID produced long lasting reduction in the
HbA1c in patients with T2DM and 68% of subjects maintained HbA1c <6.5% at 6 years.
Nonetheless, this combination had some limitations. Approximately, one third of subjects failed to
maintain the treatment goal and bone mineral density has decreased in women > 50 years. These
limitations can be avoided by using dual GLP-1 /GIP agonist in combination with pioglitazone.
Thus, the present study is a comparative effectiveness study comparing the efficacy and durability
of HbA1c reduction by two initial combination therapies, one therapy (pioglitazone plus
tirzepatide) is based on the principle of correcting the underlying metabolic defects in T2DM
versus a second therapy (metformin plus sitagliptin) which focuses on lowering the plasma
glucose concentration."

This proposal is to develop a generalizable method to make genetically-encoded biosensors to monitor the
dynamics, abundance, and positions of specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. The strategy
is based on our previous success in generating avidity-driven biosensors for distinct types of ubiquitin (Ub)-
modified nucleosomes; each sensor is comprised of a nucleosome-recognizing Anchor, a Ub-binding UBD
domain, and a Linker developed to maximize affinity and specificity. For Ub-modified proteins in particular,
development of antibodies or other site-specific detection reagents has been notoriously difficult. Our goal is to
extend the avidity-based strategy to engineer sensors able to detect heretofore intractable molecular targets
such as the multiple and functionally distinct Ub signals found on nucleosomes. To accomplish this, our team
will develop rational protein design technology that embraces multi-valent binding with tunable molecular
flexibility. In Aim 1, we will design and test Linkers that deliver tunable domain geometry and motion. We will
adapt new machine-learning algorithms to design fusion proteins that fix constituent Anchor and UBD domains
in conformational space to maximize avidity and specificity. Furthermore, we will explore two new approaches
to expand the Anchor repertoire and broaden applicability of the avidity strategy. In Aim 2, we will adopt the
splitFAST fluorogen system to install a transferrable Anchor-binding tag on the substrate, and In Aim 3 we will
develop customized Anchors from a yeast-display DARPin library. The efficacy and utility of the new sensors will
be evaluated in vitro and in cells where they will be used to probe signaling associated with DNA damage repair
pathways. In Aim 4, we will test and optimize conditions to use the sensors in genomic applications such as
CUT&RUN assays. The reagents we develop in this project will allow researchers to probe otherwise invisible
live-cell processes that are difficult or impossible to image with existing technologies. Our innovative approach
directly addresses the challenge of binding to a highly flexible multi-domain protein target. As such, the resulting
technology and design workflow will find application for diverse ubiquitinated targets, and more generally for
binding targets that would otherwise be inaccessible due to high flexibility."

 Access to sufficient, high-quality, and safe food and nutrition is a fundamental human right. Lacking this
denotes food insecurity (FI), becoming a significant societal and public health crisis. FI increases the risk of
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Yet, there is insufficient evidence on the causal link and potential
mediating mechanisms between FI and cardiometabolic disease (CMD). Posited pathways are neuroendocrine
factors, dietary factors, such as dysfunctional eating or specific fats like trans fats or ceramides, and positive or
negative psychological factors. But few studies have investigated these pathways. It is also unclear how
persistent vs. transient FI influences CMD. Moreover, the impact of food procurement decisions on FI and diet
quality has been barely studied. These gaps are largely due to scant comprehensive longitudinal studies,
leading key agencies to call for rigorous research on the mechanisms linking FI and CMD in vulnerable groups.
 Due to social and cardiovascular-related inequities, compounded by vulnerability to climate-change events,
FI prevalence in the US territory of Puerto Rico (PR) is 33.2%, three times the US prevalence. This makes PR a
pressing case and an ideal setting to study contributors to - and health consequences of - FI. With the goal of
elucidating the complex pathways connecting FI and CMD, in 2018 we established PROSPECT: Puerto Rico
Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends (R01-HL143792), a
longitudinal cohort of adults aged 30-75 y. PROSPECT includes a thorough clinical examination and collects
blood, urine, saliva, and hair samples to assess CMD, and validated psychosocial measures, a food frequency
questionnaire, geocoded food access metrics, and the USDA Food Security Survey Module. Our reports show
that 73% of participants have abdominal obesity, 61% have high blood pressure, 33% have FI, and 53% receive
the Nutrition Assistance Program. We propose to renew PROSPECT to assess CMD at 4y and 6y post-baseline,
screen for transient FI between visits, and analyze circulating fatty acids and novel biomarkers. We will enrich
representation from rural areas and men, key CVD factors, with 500 new participants. Over 6y, we aim to
determine associations between persistent and transient FI and CMD, directly or via neuroendocrine markers;
identify dietary and psychosocial mechanisms linking FI and CMD; and identify food procurement factors
associated with FI and diet. Exploratory analysis will georeference climate change indicators with FI.
 PROSPECT leverages an established interdisciplinary team, a thorough dataset, multiple timepoints to
examine complex pathways, novel biomarkers, and original analysis of FI and climate-change events. We have
already produced pivotal publications, action-oriented initiatives, ancillary studies, and a biorepository and
research infrastructure in PR. This renewal will enhance our unique cohort and generate compelling results
that will advance science by elucidating mechanisms between FI and CMD, serving as model for other groups,
and will inform food-related and psychosocial programs to alleviate FI and CMD inequities in PR and beyond."

 There is a critical need for RNA sensors in living mammalian cells. With the advent of single-cell RNA
sequencing, the transcriptome of any cell type is readily obtainable if not already available. In contrast, we are
still in urgent need for a universal method to act on such transcriptomic information. If we can genetically express
arbitrary effector proteins in specific cell types according to their transcriptional markers, we would transform
large swaths of basic research and biomedical applications, such as immunology, neuroscience, and cancer
therapy. In addition, we would like such sensors to be programmable and operate at the post-transcription level.
 One promising use case that would benefit from such sensors is cancer ablation, using an approach
dubbed “circuits as medicine”, where a genetic vector encoding an entire “circuit” (metaphor for a collection of
biomolecules engineered to regulate each other and implement specific functions) is delivered intracellularly.
The circuit will sense the cellular states based on hallmarks of cancer (i.e., the overexpression of specific RNAs
or the presence of specific mutations), process the signals, and deliver specific therapeutic payloads accordingly
in cancer cells, directly killing them while educating the immune system to search and destroy other cancer cells.
 Previous efforts largely relied on strand displacement, a successful strategy for nucleic acid-based signal
processing outside cells. However, their functionality has remained inadequate inside living mammalian cells,
most likely because the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed during strand displacement signals viral infection
and are actively engaged by mammalian proteins in the immune pathways. We hypothesize that, because it is
impossible to evade the omnipresent dsRNA-interacting proteins, it is wiser to embrace them. In this proposal,
we will leverage endogenous human enzymes that recognize and specifically edit dsRNA, to create sensors that
can be programmed to respond to arbitrary RNA transcripts (“triggers”).
 First, we will use fast design-build-test cycles in vitro to optimize sensor performance. We will focus on
increasing sensor output in response to triggers by engineering the sensor configuration and its sequence choice,
and we will characterize how the sensor affects and is affected by the cellular context. Second, to enable the
quantitative distinction of different trigger levels and the integration of multiple triggers, we will engineer
threshold-setting modifications and AND logic gates. Third, leveraging the unique post-transcriptional nature of
such sensors and gates, we will combine them with mRNA or an oncolytic RNA virus as delivery vectors, which
has traditionally been difficult to control. Last by not least, we will validate the performance and the therapeutic
potential of the sensors, gates, and the RNA vectors in cancer cell lines.
 The future directions of the proposed project include continual optimization of the sensors, logic gates,
and vectors, testing them in more realistic cancer models including mouse models and patient-derived organoids,
and applying the tools to other fields."

Despite the known roles of chromatin remodeling complexes in driving more than 20% of human cancer, the
role of chromatin remodeling complexes in conferring therapeutic response in pediatric solid tumors is much
less understood. Rhabdoid tumor requires residual SWI/SNF activity for transformation and progression.
However, it is not known if SWI/SNF and its effect on the underlying epigenome is therapeutically targetable
and if a compound targeting this complex will be successful. Furthermore, SWI/SNF has been implicated in
epigenetic mechanisms of resistance suggesting this complex may be able to both confer sensitivity and
resistance depending on the cancer context. Fusion positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) gains
chemo-resistance without the simultaneous gain of mutations to drive this resistance. These data indicate
ARMS relapse may be driven by epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to
define the role of chromatin structure in conferring therapeutic sensitivity in rhabdoid tumor (Aim 1) and
resistance in rhabdomyosarcoma (Aim 2).
I have identified mithramycin as a SWI/SNF inhibitor that induces epigenetic reprogramming and durable tumor
regression in rhabdoid tumor. A consequence of mithramycin treatment is amplification of H3K27me3, a novel
therapeutic vulnerability as well as the restoration of chemosensitivity. The overall goal of the F99 phase (Aim
1) is to identify synthetic lethalities that arise from SWI/SNF inhibition. Specifically, aim 1.1 will define inhibition
of H3K27me3 histone demethylases KDM6A/6B as a therapeutic vulnerability in rhabdoid tumor. Aim 1.2 will
define the mechanism of mithramycin-dependent chemosensitivity. These goals will build advanced expertise
in mechanistic pharmacology, high-throughput sequencing, and in vivo modeling of combination therapies. In
contrast to RT which is known to be chemo-refractory, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is initially responsive to
chemotherapy before gaining resistance. Therefore, the K00 phase of this fellowship (Aim 2) will define the
role of chromatin remodeling in fusion positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma therapeutic resistance (ARMS).
Aim 2.1 will identify the chromatin remodeler that coordinates with PAX3/7-FOXO1, the oncogenic
transcription factor that drives ARMS transformation and progression. Aim 2.2 will profile chromatin remodeling
during the establishment of chemoresistance in an established ARMS mouse model. This phase will expand
expertise in genomic approaches to include single-cell genomics and in vivo modeling to include transgenic
models.
In summary, this study addresses the need for a mechanistic investigation into the role of chromatin
remodeling in driving therapeutic response in pediatric solid tumors. Data and training acquired in this phase
will prepare me for a career exploring epigenetic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in pediatric sarcomas."

 The etiologic agent of Lyme Disease, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), is the leading arthropod-borne infection in the
United States with over 470,000 cases diagnosed annually. Given that Lyme Disease is a significant public
health concern, studies addressing how Bb establishes and maintains infection are vital to evaluating its
pathogenic potential and developing prevention or therapeutic strategies. It is well known that Bb modifies its
transcriptional profile throughout its pathogenic lifecycle, particularly during transmission from the arthropod
vector into mammals. BosR is an important transcriptional regulator that functions as a global metalloregulatory
protein and alters the expression of genes needed for mammalian colonization. Specifically, BosR is required
for experimental infection in mice and is needed for the activation of the RpoS/RpoN/Rrp2 cascade that drives
the expression of genetically unlinked genes, including virulence determinants required for Bb infection. While
there is no doubt that the BosR-dependent regulation of rpoS is important to borrelial infectivity, there are
additional genes that BosR regulates either directly or indirectly that may factor into Bb infection. How BosR is
linked to this complex regulatory network has not been thoroughly addressed. Here, several novel BosR
regulatory functions are described, heretofore unknown, including the recognition of RNA by BosR. The
Preliminary Data shows that BosR binds to small non-coding RNA and exhibits chaperone activity suggesting
that BosR forms a complex with sRNAs that binds to Bb transcripts and targets them for degradation or enhanced
translation. This form of post-transcriptional regulation by BosR represents a new and innovative regulatory
scheme that adds to its known DNA binding activity. In Aim 1, a subset of sRNAs that BosR binds will be
evaluated, the transcripts recognized by the BosR::sRNA complex identified, and a link with the BosR-associated
sRNAs to borrelial pathogenesis established. In Aim 2, recent ChIP-seq data will be mined to assess novel BosR
DNA binding. Preliminary binding studies confirmed the ChIP-seq data for two targets and suggested that the
redox status and metal coordination of BosR may alter DNA binding. BosR DNA binding will be analyzed to
determine how the redox and metal binding status of BosR changes the target sequences recognized. Unique
BosR binding motifs will be tracked, and a consensus sequence ascertained. Finally, experiments will be
conducted to determine the phenotype of a bosR mutant that ectopically produces RpoS to query the direct role
of BosR in Bb infection. Taken together, this proposal will provide new appreciation into how BosR-mediated
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation ensues and novel insight into how BosR integrates the redox
status of Bb to affect nucleic acid binding and borrelial pathogenesis."

Asthma is the most prevalent childhood chronic illness, affecting 9.7% of adolescents. National guidelines
emphasize the importance of adherence to self-management behaviors for controlling asthma and preventing
impaired health and quality of life. Adolescents have suboptimal adherence to asthma self-management
behaviors, placing them at risk for morbidity and reduced quality of life. Asthma self-management difficulties
emerge in early adolescence as youth begin to transition towards taking more control of their treatment
regimen, making it a critical intervention period. The presence of helpful caregiver support is pivotal in
determining whether early adolescents ultimately develop and master asthma self-management behaviors. Our
interdisciplinary team received NIH funding (PI: Fedele; R21 HD083830) to respond to the critical need for the
development of an intervention to facilitate helpful caregiver support in early adolescents (12-15 year-olds) with
poorly controlled asthma. AIM2ACT is a dyadic smartphone intervention, informed by the Pediatric Self-
Management Model that is specifically tailored to increase helpful caregiver support and adolescent asthma
self-efficacy, thereby improving asthma control. AIM2ACT contains three components: 1) ecological
momentary assessment to identify personalized strengths and weaknesses in asthma self-management
behaviors; 2) collaborative identification and tracking of goals that help early adolescents to become
increasingly independent in managing their asthma; and 3) a suite of engaging skills training videos to help
dyads understand how to use AIM2ACT and work together to set asthma self-management goals, develop and
achieve goals, and engage in problem-solving communication. Results of our pilot trial revealed high feasibility
and acceptability of our protocol and preliminary efficacy for AIM2ACT in improving asthma control. The
proposed study will test the efficacy of AIM2ACT and long-term maintenance of treatment effects in a fully-
powered randomized controlled trial with 160 early adolescents with poorly controlled persistent asthma, ages
12-15 years, and a caregiver. Families will be randomly assigned to receive AIM2ACT (n=80) or a mHealth
attention control condition (n=80) that accounts for staff attention and novelty of a technology-based
intervention for 6 months. Dyads in the control condition will not receive personalized asthma management
feedback, will not be guided through collaborative identification and tracking of asthma self-management goals,
and will not have access to skills training videos. Instead, they will receive static educational information on
their smartphones about behavioral management techniques they can use to target improving asthma self-
management. The control condition is designed to optimize recruitment and sustain interest while concurrently
having a minimal impact on asthma management. Assessments will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and
3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up time points. Patient-reported (e.g., Asthma Control Test) and objectively
monitored (e.g., spirometry, medication adherence) outcomes will be collected."

The mechanistic underpinnings of diseases involving the exocrine pancreas are poorly understood. Chronic
pancreatitis is often accompanied by inflammation of the pancreas, irreversible fibrosis, and destruction of the
pancreatic parenchyma resulting in abdominal pain, malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,
pancreatogenic diabetes, and, in some cases, pancreas cancer. We have developed a network of adult and

Human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1) is a secretory enzyme that can block
the flow of biochemical information by catalyzing the cleavage of cellular RNA.
Our intent is to use ideas and methods from biological chemistry, molecular
biology, and cell biology to reveal key mechanistic aspects of the cytotoxicity of
human RNase 1 in physiological and (potentially) clinical settings. During the
next grant period, this intent will be achieved in four Specific Aims.
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the complex of RNase 1
with the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein (which has femtomolar affinity
for RNase 1) acts as a “sensor” for oxidative damage within a human cell. In
Aim 2, we will determine the structural and physiological roles of the N-linked
glycans that are installed on RNase 1. In Aim 3, we will develop an RNase 1
zymogen as a “prodrug” that is activated by matrix metalloproteases. In Aim 4,
we will evaluate RNase 1 as an endogenous antimicrobial agent.
Significance. The results of the research proposed herein will provide a detailed
biochemical understanding of the cytotoxic activity of RNase 1, and could
ultimately lead to new chemotherapeutic agents based on an endogenous human
enzyme."

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative vascular disease with high lethality upon aneurysm
rupture, which is particularly prevalent in the aged population. Surgical repairs, albeit invasive and risky,
remain the only treatment option, with no pharmacotherapies clinically available. Thus, there is a compelling
unmet clinical need to discover non-invasive strategies to slow down or even reverse the progression of AAA
lesions. We contend that the first AAA drug therapy will only arise through discoveries of both effective drug
targets and innovative delivery methods. A growing body of evidence reveals that degenerative smooth muscle
cells (SMCs) orchestrate AAA pathogenesis and progression. The dying SMCs incite deleterious dialogues
with endothelial cells and macrophages, weakening the aortic wall while propagating inflammation. Our
exciting preliminary data indicates that the Protein Kinase R-like ER Kinase (PERK) arm of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response pathway is a potent driver of SMC degeneration and hence a potential target
for AAA intervention. We found that either pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of PERK blocked
SMC degeneration and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. Moreover, SMC-specific deletion of
PERK profoundly reduced the incidence of aortic aneurysm as well as the rupture risk in an angiotensin (Ang)II
model in male mice. Importantly, we also conceived a biomimetic, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detonable,
and size-tunable “cluster bomb” nanodesign that uniquely caters to AAA-targeted delivery of versatile
therapeutic payloads, either hydrophobic PERK inhibitors or siRNAs. This platelet membrane coated
nanoplatform demonstrated excellent AAA homing, aortic wall penetration, and when loaded with a selective
PERK inhibitor, halted the progression of pre-existing AAA lesions in a murine model induced by elastase
challenge. These preliminary findings and published evidence lead to our central hypothesis: PERK is a key
driver of SMC degeneration and AAA pathology; and PERK-targeting therapy — enabled through a multi-
modal “cluster bomb” nanoplatform — can lead to effective stabilization or even regression of pre-existing AAA
lesions. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the specific role of PERK in SMC degeneration and the
underlying mechanisms such as PERK-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction (Aim 1a), as well as its role in the
onset and propagation of experimental AAA in two distinct murine models (Aim 1b). We will also develop highly
innovative multi-modal “cluster bomb” nanoplatforms to encapsulate PERK small molecule inhibitors (Aim-2a)
or siRNAs (Aim-2b) and evaluate their utility for PERK-targeting AAA therapies in murine models. Thus, a
unique strength of this proposal is the combined innovations in both drug target and delivery method. The
ultimate product will be a new paradigm in non-invasive management of AAA, which is expected to significantly
reduce the mortality, morbidity, and tremendous costs inflicted upon the rapidly growing elderly populations.

Social stress is a prevailing factor in the lives of all social species and can motivate the misuse of reinforcing
drugs such as alcohol. Individuals that use alcohol to alleviate the negative emotions created by social stress
are more likely to develop pathological drinking patterns, which can lead to an alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Indeed, an individual’s standing in a social hierarchy (i.e. social rank) is inversely related to alcohol
consumption in rodents and non-human primates as well as problematic drinking in humans, highlighting the
conserved impact of subordination stress on motivation for alcohol. Social rank also influences how individuals
respond to challenges, and social isolation is a particularly profound stressor with increasing human relevance.
Our preliminary data identify a previously unknown relationship between mouse social rank and isolation-
associated escalated alcohol drinking, where subordinates display a greater magnitude increase in drinking
following social isolation compared to dominants. These data suggest that low social rank may be a potent risk
factor for developing pathological alcohol drinking patterns. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms by
which social stress experiences engender aberrant alcohol drinking could have important translational
implications for AUD. It is becoming increasingly evident that social stress induces microglia-mediated
neuroimmune responses in select stress-responsive brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which contribute to stress-induced behavioral adaptations. Notably,
social isolation-induced escalation of alcohol strongly parallels increases in microglia previously seen following
social stress, supporting a potential role for microglia in isolation-induced adaptations in alcohol drinking.
Despite the substantial evidence linking social stress and alcohol drinking as well as the impact of social stress
on neuroimmune signaling, virtually nothing is known regarding the neuroimmune regulation of circuits
underlying social stress-induced behavioral adaptions in alcohol drinking. To fill this gap, this proposal will test
the central hypothesis that social stress activates microglia-mediated neuroimmune signaling, which re-shapes
amygdalar-cortical circuits underlying escalated alcohol drinking. Preliminary data show that social isolation
increases BLA excitability, and the BLA-mPFC circuit regulates alcohol drinking. Dr. Patel will use her new
training in advanced circuit imaging and dissection technologies and previous training in cell type specific
transcriptomic analysis and ex vivo electrophysiology to 1) dissect the BLA-mPFC contribution to social rank-
and isolation-induced alcohol drinking, 2) delineate the impact of BLA substrates on mPFC encoding of alcohol
consumption, and 3) identify social stress-induced neuroimmune determinants driving circuit adaptations
underlying aberrant alcohol drinking. In executing the proposed experiments and professional development
plan, Dr. Patel will be well-positioned to transition to a tenured-track faculty position and establish an
independent research program centered around neuroimmune and social stress regulation of circuits in AUD."

This proposed 5-year study brings together Dr. Stokes’ training in population health and research on tobacco
use behaviors with additional training in tobacco regulatory science, cardiovascular (CV) epidemiology,
advanced biostatistics, and applied data science. To this end, Dr. Stokes has assembled a multidisciplinary
team of mentors and advisors to aid his training and studies. The K01 will support a complementary set of
training activities, including formal coursework, participation in the Early Career Faculty Development Program,
the NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Institute sponsored K-to-R PRIME program, and strong
mentorship from experts in relevant fields, to help him in his professional development and transition to
independence. Population-based evidence on the CV effects of e-cigarette use is sparse, and the particular
components of e-cigarette aerosols that may be responsible for CV harm remain poorly elucidated. The
proposed research will integrate state-of-the-art causal inference methods, mediation analyses, and
unsupervised data clustering approaches with the study of CV effects of e-cigarette use. The applicant will 1)
examine the association of e-cigarette use and product transitions with incident CV events; 2) estimate
associations of e-cigarette use with risk factors and preclinical biomarkers of CV injury, and analyze
biomarkers of exposure as potential mediators; and 3) identify unique biomarker signatures of e-cigarette
exposure using a data-driven clustering approach, and associate clusters with preclinical biomarkers of CV
injury. With high quality population data and novel statistical methods to optimally control for cigarette smoking
and other tobacco product use, the results of this project will provide timely and rigorous evidence on the CV
effects of e-cigarette use. Together with evaluating the mediating role of exposure biomarkers and clustered e-
cigarette use behavior patterns, the results will inform Food and Drug Administration regulatory standards for
product safety and guide primary and secondary public health interventions that aim to reduce tobacco-related
CV harm. The methods and findings will also inform future studies focused on other non-cigarette tobacco
products, such as little cigars, cigarillos, and smokeless tobacco products. The additional training and
protected time afforded by the K01 will aid Dr. Stokes in making his transition to an independent investigator
capable of securing R-series NIH funding."
10885609,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lymphatic vessel (LV) differentiation, development, and morphogenesis are central in maintaining fluid
homeostasis, regulating host immunity, and transporting dietary fat and neuronal waste. All these functions
are governed by lymphatic drainage, a transport of interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system through the initial
LVs and collecting LVs. The initial LVs show permeable button-like junction morphology and are ready to
uptake interstitial fluid; by contrast, the collecting LVs are less permeable with zipper-like junction structure,
so that the collecting LVs transport ‘lymph’ to lymph nodes without leaking. Impaired lymphatic drainage
contributes to many human diseases, such as lymphedema, immune dysfunction, fibrosis, obesity, cancer,
and Alzheimer’s disease. While little is known about why LVs become dysfunctional, clinical studies reveal
that inflammation is one of the leading contributors to the lymphatic dysfunction. Although dysfunctional
collecting LVs has been extensively studied, how inflammation impacts initial LV development and
morphogenesis is unclear, because in our current experimental models, including animal models, we often
cannot decouple multifactorial inflammatory factors in the lymphatic endothelium. Since two-dimensional cell
culture has failed to recapitulate three-dimensional (3D) tissue architecture of lymphatics, researchers have
developed 3D in vitro models of LVs, demonstrating lymphatic sprouting, lymphatic network formation, and
LV interactions with other cells. However, these previous models have not created 3D lymphatic structure
with specialized LEC junction development enabling controlled fluid drainage through the button-like
junctions and physiological inflammatory response. In this proposal, we will use a bioengineered in vitro 3D
lymphatic vascular system, exhibiting button-like junction morphogenesis of the LVs and fluid drainage to
understand the regulation of LEC junction and drainage by focusing on ROCK1/2 and integrin α5 signaling.
In Aim 1, we will examine the roles of ROCKs in LEC junction and drainage. Next, we will scrutinize the
mechanisms of ROCKs-mediated junction zippering in LECs. In Aim 2, we will study integrin α5 mediated
regulation of LEC junction and lymphatic drainage. We will then determine signal transduction through
ROCKs and integrin α5 and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of targeting ROCKs and integrin α5 in lymphatic
dysfunction and inflammation models in vivo. In summary, we will use a bioengineered model of 3D lymphatic
vessels and fluid transport to provide an understanding of lymphatic drainage in normal and inflammatory
conditions."

The gut microbiome is linked to human health through diverse mechanisms including immune system

influence the gut microbiota. In the first area, we will characterize the relationship between temperate
phage l and its cognate bacteria, E. coli, in the conventionally-colonized murine gut. We will then study
the significance of specific prophage-encoded functions that are competitively advantageous within the

Post-transcriptional modifications through adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing are critical for maintaining the
diverse repertoire of RNA transcripts in the human brain. These modifications occur at isolated adenosines and
across multiple consecutive adenosines within an extended region along the same RNA molecule. A-to-I editing
influences gene function, alternative splicing, protein sequences, miRNA binding, and RNA structures. Recent
work by us and others show that A-to-I editing is abundant during normal aging and changes in editing levels
are tied to etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/RD). Nevertheless, substantial gaps
persist regarding the precise roles and implications of A-to-I editing in AD/RD. For instance, the majority of A-to-
I sites are expected to undergo dynamic regulation within a common double-stranded (ds)RNA structure
throughout the progression of normal aging and dementia severity. However, our understanding of this context-
dependent regulation of RNA editing is currently limited. Moreover, the role of common genetic variation on the
regulation of A-to-I editing levels (editing quantitative trait loci [edQTLs]), as well as their impact on A-to-I sites
en masse along a shared dsRNA structure, has been significantly understudied. There has also been a dearth
of experimental tools that precisely probe the function of candidate A-to-I sites. We will bridge the existing
knowledge gaps through a comprehensive approach that will: Aim 1) Address the unmet need for basic
neuroscientific research that can capture fundamental regulation of RNA editing across brain development,
normal aging and in AD/RD; Aim 2) Integrate individual genetic information to construct robust maps of edQTLs
and identify AD/RD risk loci that modulate A-to-I editing levels and dsRNA structures across ancestries and cell
types; Aim 3) Establish a systematic and biologically validated prioritization of AD/RD-associated A-to-I sites,
using an integrative computational approach together with a site-directed RNA editing molecular toolbox.
Capitalizing on the significant progress made by large-scale consortia initiatives, we will investigate the functional
and regulatory roles of A-to-I editing in AD/RD with unprecedented scale and depth. Results from this proposal
will reveal more nuanced and accurate insights into the molecular and genetic underpinnings of AD/RD
pathobiology, paving the way for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for these devastating
neurodegenerative diseases."

Aberrations in chromatin structure can be a causal mechanism of numerous human disease and developmental
syndromes. R-loops are RNA containing chromatin structures that are deregulated in numerous developmental
disorders and cancers. In most cases the underlying mechanisms and the functional significance of R-loop
deregulation and whether they are causal to specific disease is not clear. Activity dependent neuroprotective
protein (ADNP) is a homeodomain containing transcriptional repressor that is critical for neuronal differentiation
and neurodevelopment. ADNP mutations cause ADNP syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual
disability and features of autism spectrum disorder. ADNP is upregulated during neurodevelopment. ADNP
contains zinc finger motifs and a homeodomain, both of which can bind nucleic acids. ADNP syndrome mutations
result in protein products that lack the homeodomain, underscoring the importance of this region to ADNP
function. However, the precise contributions of the zinc fingers and homeodomain to ADNP localization and
function in gene expression during neuronal differentiation is not well understood. Our preliminary data have
uncovered a novel role for ADNP in the resolution of R-loops. Biochemical assays revealed that ADNP resolves
R-loops – in a homeodomain dependent manner. ADNP also suppresses R-loops in vivo, as deletion of ADNP
in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) resulted in R-loop accumulation specifically at ADNP target sites, but
not at sites not bound by ADNP. Last, ADNP-deficient mESCs and mESCs exclusively expressing an ADNP
mutant lacking the homeodomain fail to differentiate into neural progenitor cells (NPCs), indicating an essential
role for ADNP and its homeodomain in neuronal differentiation. These results suggest a potentially novel
mechanism – R-loop resolution – for ADNP, and possibly other homeodomain-containing proteins, in gene
regulation, which can link R-loop dysfunction to numerous disorders and diseases caused by mutations in
homeodomain proteins. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that ADNP drives neuronal
differentiation by suppressing R-loops; as a corollary, we propose that resolving R-loops that accumulate upon
ADNP loss may rescue gene expression programs to enable neuronal differentiation. We propose two aims to
test our central hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular basis of R-loop resolution by ADNP by
identifying roles of the ADNP protein domains and their interactions with nucleic acids. In Aim 2, we will elucidate
how ADNP suppression of R-loops influences neuronal differentiation."

an increased risk of CV events, and higher cardiovascular (CV) mortality within 2 years of release. Access to
healthcare following release from prison is key to preventing poor health outcomes in this population.
Systematic investigation of SRD in diverse healthcare systems has not occurred, and the extent to which

leaders, frontline staff, and representatives of community-based organizations to measure policies, practices
and attitudes around healthcare access, transition programs, culture, support of social determinants of health
and specialized services for people released from prison. In Aim 2, leveraging a database of individuals
released from Colorado state prisons (~400 a month), we will prospectively enroll 600 people recently released
from prison into a longitudinal cohort study to assess their exposure to healthcare structural conditions
following release. Using the all-payer claims database, we will examine the association between exposure to
structural conditions and 12-month primary outcomes of healthcare utilization (clinic visits, emergency visits,
hospitalization) and secondary outcomes of CV hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Race/ethnicity and
baseline CV health will be examined as moderating variables because intersectional SRD may particularly
disadvantage BIPOC individuals released from prison and those with poor CV health. In Aim 3, we will
integrate results from Aims 1 and 2 to develop practice recommendations to improve health care access and
outcomes for people released from prison. Recommendations will be iteratively revised with a community
advisory board and finalized using a modified Delphi panel of national experts. Final recommendations will be
assembled and broadly disseminated. Given the enormity of the population of individuals with a history of
imprisonment, their significant burden of poor health including CV disease and the disproportionate
imprisonment of BIPOC individuals, a critical goal of our research is to identify targets for future interventions to
improve access and health for people released from prison. Solutions to the significant problem of negative
health consequences to imprisonment and SRD requires understanding structural conditions at multiple levels."

Societal systems of racism, segregation, and criminal justice practices have resulted in high rates of

Inflammation is a vastly underappreciated player in meibomian gland dysfunction – a common pathological
condition of eyelid sebaceous glands responsible for producing tear film lipids. Pathologic blockage of the gland
orifice and central duct, referred to as “obstructive” meibomian gland dysfunction, is regularly accompanied by
ocular surface inflammation in patients. Moreover, this type of obstruction is ubiquitous, and even more
aggressive, in patients with ocular surface immune disease. The latter is defined here as ocular surface
pathology associated with systemic immune disorders, such as atopy (allergy), Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic
epidermal necrolysis, Sjogren’s syndrome, graft versus host disease, cicatricial pemphigoid, and others. Still,
the exact immune mechanisms involved in meibomian gland dysfunction remain elusive. As no pharmacological
agents are indicated for meibomian gland dysfunction, there is a critical need for uncovering the pertinent
immune responses of this pathobiology in patients with ocular surface immune disease. In the last funding cycle,
we showed a direct role for neutrophils in meibomian gland dysfunction in our model of chronic-like allergic eye
disease. Based on this work and the current literature, our central hypothesis is that neutrophils play a role in
driving meibomian gland dysfunction across different forms of ocular surface immune diseases. In the current
proposal, we will: i) elucidate the pathogenic neutrophil mechanisms that drive meibomian gland dysfunction in
our established model of chronic-like allergic eye disease; ii) decipher the role of neutrophils in meibomian gland
dysfunction in a novel and spontaneous genetic mouse model of ocular surface immune disease; and iii) map
the tear immune cell landscape of meibomian gland dysfunction in patients with different ocular surface immune
disease entities. In addition to mouse models, we will leverage our unpublished single cell RNA-seq dataset of
immune cells from blood, conjunctiva, and tears from our allergic eye disease mouse model, paired with
computational, genetic, and pharmacologic tools to pinpoint the pathogenic neutrophil mechanisms. For human
samples, we established a 36-color flow cytometry panel for deep immune profiling of patient tears and have
incorporated clinical expertise for the annotation of each individual with detailed clinical metadata. The rationale
for this project is that identifying the critical immune cell subsets and associated pathogenic cellular programs
that drive meibomian gland dysfunction will offer a strong scientific framework by which to delineate the role of
inflammation in human meibomian gland dysfunction, as well as identify novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic
immune markers to support efforts in the clinical space. Completion of these studies is therefore expected to
have a significant impact by expanding the breadth and depth of knowledge regarding the role of inflammation,
specifically neutrophils, in meibomian gland dysfunction, ultimately providing new opportunities to treat and
diagnose this pervasive condition."
10875421,"Engaging the most vulnerable people with HIV in treatment is central to efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Low-
barrier care (LBC) is an evidence-based multicomponent intervention that includes walk-in access to medical
care, incentives for clinic visits and viral suppression, intensive support to address social determinants of health,
and multisectoral service coordination. The Max Clinic in Seattle is a flagship LBC clinic that has substantially
improved viral suppression among people with complex barriers to care, including unstable housing, substance
use, and mental health disorders. Expanding LBC is central to the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan in King
County, Washington. The overall goals of this 5-year proposal are to study LBC expansion in King County,
identify factors that facilitate LBC implementation, and prepare for the intervention’s scale-up in other EHE
jurisdictions. The team will employ a multifaceted implementation strategy to establish and improve two new LBC
clinics in addition to the Max Clinic. We will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation &
Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and structured tools to assess intervention adaptation and scalability. For Aim
1, we will evaluate the reach and effectiveness of LBC expansion in King County using a population-based
observational open cohort design. For Aim 2, we will describe the implementation and maintenance of LBC in
King County, including intervention adaptations, organizational strategies to overcome barriers, and costs. Using
the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME), we will conduct focus group
discussions with key stakeholders in the LBC clinics and the health department at baseline and conduct brief re-
assessments in six-month intervals over four years to describe intervention adaptations and elucidate
implementation and maintenance strategies. We will quantify the costs of LBC expansion from the health
department and healthcare organization perspectives using micro-costing methods. For Aim 3, we will assess
the scalability of the LBC intervention and identify a consortium of health department and clinic leaders to scale-
up LBC in cities and states prioritized for the first phase of EHE funding throughout the U.S. We will partner with
NASTAD (the National Association of State & Territorial AIDS Directors) to identify health department HIV
program leaders supportive of LBC implementation, and in collaboration with them, recruit leaders of Ryan
White-funded HIV Clinics or Community Health Center clinics. We will conduct in in-depth interviews with both
the health department and clinic leaders using the Intervention Scalability Assessment Tool (ISAT) for applied
assessment of LBC implementation considerations in each local context. Expected Outcome: Our results will
guide optimization of LBC implementation, inform intervention adaptations, and lay the groundwork for strategic
scale-up of LBC in other parts of the country, which will in turn, advance progress toward achieving EHE goals."
10875427,"Electrical stimulation has been shown to be a useful technique for delivering information to the brain
from brain-machine interfacing technology. The brain is remarkably capable of learning to interpret such
information, most notably demonstrated by the success of cochlear implants. Learning to translate stimulation
into useful information can be attributed to neural plasticity, yet little is known about the relationship between
localized electrical stimulation and subsequent effects on brain regions distant from the simulation site. In the
specific context of stimulating cortical gray matter, or intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), a common
assumption is that post-stimulation effects remain localized to a small volume of neurons near the stimulating
electrode. However, there is evidence that suggests the effects can spread substantial distances.
 Prior work in my lab has shown that subjects can learn to interpret ICMS delivered to four different
electrodes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as instructions to perform four different arbitrarily-
assigned movements. My preliminary studies using that dataset suggest that ICMS delivered in S1 can have
two types of effects on neurons in distant cortical areas: 1) ICMS pulses can directly elicit spikes in neurons
from both ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary motor cortex (M1) – either antidromically,
monosynaptically, or oligosynaptically – which I term “direct driving”. 2) Other neurons not directly driven by the
ICMS pulses may nevertheless fire differently between trials instructing the same movements with only trains
of ICMS pulses versus with only visual cues, which I term “instruction-modality dependent modulation”. Thus,
the effects of ICMS may extend to parts of the cortical network more distant than previously appreciated.
 I propose to investigate the effects of ICMS instructions for arbitrarily-associated movements delivered
in S1 on several distant cortical areas involved in motor control. Specifically, I will study effects in seven frontal
and parietal regions: pre-supplementary motor area, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, rostral
primary motor cortex, caudal primary motor cortex, anterior intraparietal area, and dorsal posterior parietal
cortex. Aim I will examine which of those cortical areas contain neurons that are directly driven by ICMS pulses
delivered in S1. Aim II will examine which of those cortical areas contain neurons that show instruction-
modality dependent modulation. The proposed studies will show the extent to which ICMS in S1 modulates
distant parts of the cortical network, and how such modulation develops over time as subjects learn to use the
ICMS as instructions to perform arbitrarily-associated movements. That information can be used to design
inputs to cortex from brain-machine interfacing technology that is clearer to the subject and encourages
healthy plasticity to reduce cognitive demand during the training process. Those improvements serve to benefit
patients with diseases of the nervous system that can be treated with brain-machine interfacing technology
including stroke, sensory neuropathies, or head trauma."

With increasing legalization of medicinal cannabis, there is an urgent need to identify patients at-risk for
cannabis use disorder (CUD), which can occur as an unintended adverse effect of using medicinal cannabis.
A national survey indicated that 11% who used medicinal cannabis met criteria for a past year DSM-IV CUD.
However, DSM-based CUD diagnosis has limitations when applied to medicinal cannabis (MC). Specifically,
many MC patients might report tolerance and withdrawal due to frequent MC use, but not show a pathological
pattern of cannabis use (e.g., impaired control over use). To improve identification of MC patients who show a
pathological pattern of use, we extend DSM-5’s model for diagnosing substance use disorder for prescription
medication to MC (CUD-MC). CUD-MC addresses limitations by putting the focus on symptoms indicating a
pathological pattern of cannabis use, and recognizing that tolerance and withdrawal might occur as expected
neuroadaptations from cannabis used in a medicinal dosing regimen. However, tolerance can be a significant
clinical problem because it decreases a medication's effects, resulting in dose escalation and, for some people,
impaired control over use, whereas withdrawal can drive continuing, heavy cannabis use (e.g., use to avoid or
relieve withdrawal) that may be associated with cannabis-related problems. This project investigates the roles
of tolerance and withdrawal in the likelihood of a pathological pattern of cannabis use (CUD-MC), and identifies
risk factors for cannabis misuse in MC patients to help prevent the iatrogenic effect of CUD-MC resulting from
MC use. To generate new insights into the roles of tolerance to specific cannabis effects (e.g., relief of pain,
anxiety) and withdrawal in likelihood of CUD-MC over 2-year follow-up, this project uses the innovative
combination of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) with longer-term follow-up to examine the likelihood
of CUD-MC, focusing on two key criteria, tolerance and withdrawal, in MC patients. This project will recruit
patients (N=400, age >18; 50% female; 25% new patients), e.g., from MC dispensaries. In this repeated
measures study, participants complete a baseline visit, followed by 14-day EMA. Follow-ups at 6-month
intervals through 18-months trigger 14-day EMA data collection. Follow-ups occur on-line at 6- and 18-months;
and in-person at 12- and 24-months to collect biomarkers such as quantitative THC and CBD metabolite level
and lung function measures (spirometry). Project aims are to (1) examine how DSM-5 tolerance is associated
with THC dose, specific cannabis effects (e.g., relief of pain, anxiety) and CUD-MC; (2) determine how pattern
of MC use (in EMA and at longer intervals) is associated with DSM-5 withdrawal and CUD-MC over 2-years;
and (3) identify risk factors for CUD-MC; and examine cannabis-related health outcomes (e.g., lung
functioning), including change in use of other medications, over 2-years. Identifying risk factors for CUD-MC
aligns with NIDA's Cannabis Policy Research Agenda and Strategic Plan. Project results will help inform MC
practice guidelines and the development of personalized interventions to minimize cannabis-related harms."

 Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a debilitating and life-long addictive disease with significant public health
costs. OUD is characterized by various symptoms, including a compulsive need to use, loss of control over
use, and a negative emotional state induced by withdrawal. Mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) are known to contribute to both the rewarding effects of opioid use and the aversive
signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, there is growing evidence that additional populations of
MOR, which is broadly expressed throughout emotional and motivational brain circuits, critically contribute to
opioid-related behaviors. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) regulate dopamine release and responding
for rewards. Given these important functions of CINs, and because this neuronal subpopulation expresses
MOR, we hypothesize that MOR stimulation alters CIN activity and striatal dopamine release to promote opioid
reward, consumption, and withdrawal-induced aversion. Our experiments will test this hypothesis through
completion of two primary specific aims. We will determine 1) whether MORs on cholinergic interneurons
participate in opioid reward and withdrawal and 2) whether CIN MORs regulate dopamine release during opioid
reward and withdrawal. Opioid reward will be tested using a conditioned place preference (CPP) task and
withdrawal using conditioned place aversion (CPA). Opioid consumption will be assessed with a limited
access, two-bottle choice fentanyl drinking task developed in our lab. Collectively, completion of these aims will
demonstrate that MORs on NAc CINs contribute to opioid reward, consumption, and withdrawal through
modulation of DA release. Furthermore, we will train undergraduate students in a broad array of modern
behavioral neuroscience techniques, such as chemogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and
fluorophotometry. These activities will expand access to meaningful research opportunities to a diverse set of
talented undergraduate students interested in neuroscience and other biomedical research fields at Miami
University."

Reducing stigma to ensure viral load (VL) suppression for women with serious mental illness (SMI) and HIV is a
global priority, including in Botswana, where the intersectional stigma of SMI, HIV and womanhood is
marginalizing in ways that impede adherence to both psychiatric medications and antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which can threaten VL suppression. We apply our novel ‘what matters most’ (WMM) approach to target
intersectional stigma faced by women with SMI and HIV in Botswana via a stigma-reduction intervention in the
high-risk transition period after discharge from an initial psychiatric hospitalization. WMM conceptualizes how
stigma is felt most acutely when people are unable to achieve ‘full personhood’ by participating in the activities
that ‘matter most’ in their local context. In prior research, we found the core value for ‘full womanhood’ in
Botswana is achieved by being the ‘foundation of the household’ and is threatened by perceived: 1)
incompetence in fulfilling the duties of a family caregiver associated with SMI and 2) promiscuity associated with
having HIV. In Botswana, family acceptance as a viable ‘family caregiver’ is also key to achieving ‘full status’ as
a woman. As such, the risks of being identified as having SMI and HIV (e.g., partner/family abandonment) can
deter psychiatric and ART treatment adherence. Promoting capabilities that ‘matter most’ for achieving ‘full
womanhood’ could enable longer-term stigma reduction after psychiatric discharge, when women are
reintegrating into their communities, and improve ART adherence and promote sustained VL suppression. Our
group-based WMM stigma intervention is co-led by a peer woman who has coped effectively with SMI and HIV
stigma. The WMM stigma intervention model was piloted among pregnant women with HIV in Botswana with
promising reductions in stigma and depressive symptoms up to 4-months postpartum. We now test whether a
WMM intervention tailored for women with SMI and HIV will reduce intersectional stigma and facilitate VL
suppression. We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=180) with a 4-month follow-up to
compare the effectiveness of 1) WMM-based intersectional stigma intervention delivered as clients transition
from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care (‘WMM Stigma Intervention;’ n=90); and 2) attention control
following a similar format to isolate the effects of the intervention (n=90). Because family are commonly involved
in the care of people with SMI and face severe stigma, we propose a parallel, group stigma intervention among
family members, as addressing familial stigma could facilitate treatment adherence. Finally, because
intersectional stigma is reinforced at systemic levels, we seek to empower women with SMI and HIV to influence
structural change by coleading policymaker workshops to reduce stigma among policymakers and spur
policymakers to address the unique needs of women with SMI and HIV via future policies."

The dynamic regulation of the proteome is critical for cell survival and function. Traditionally, researchers have
focused on elucidating the discrete steps of protein synthesis, quality control, and degradation to understand
how the proteome is formed and maintained. Yet, a growing body of research suggests communication
between translation, quality control, and protein degradation pathways enables the cell to maintain protein
homeostasis (proteostasis). Proteostasis collapse is a hallmark of aging and aging-associated
neurodegenerative diseases, and alleles of proteostasis genes are associated with a wide range of human
genetic diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that underlie proteostasis holds promise for the
identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic intervention strategies to improve health across the lifespan.
My research program will address how protein quality control factors interact and feedback to regulate
translation. Our overarching goal is to determine the mechanisms by which protein degradation factors
collaborate with the translational machinery to synthesize proteins. We hypothesize that the dynamic regulation
of mRNA translation requires protein quality control and degradation activities to prevent catastrophic
proteostatic collapse. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that inhibition of the ubiquitin-
proteasome system feeds back to (i) inhibit global translation activity, and (ii) impairs the dynamics of RNA-
protein (RNP) granules that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs. In the next five years, my research
group will evaluate the role of protein quality control and degradation factors in mediating protein synthesis at
the levels of translation initiation, elongation, and by facilitating the dynamic assembly and disassembly of RNP
granules. To begin to address this problem, we will answer the following questions: (1) Is translation elongation
differentially regulated during proteostatic stress? (2) What is the role of the protein quality control machinery in
mediating translation initiation and elongation? (3) What is the relationship between translation and RNP
granules? (4) What are the molecular mechanisms by which protein quality control and degradation factors
drive RNP granule disassembly? We will leverage advanced genome engineering, optogenetics, and live cell
imaging strategies to define the mechanisms that regulate mRNA translation in human cells in response to
proteostatic stressors. The outcome of this research will be a spatially and temporally defined map of the
molecular mechanisms governing mRNA translation during proteostatic stress. The impact of this work will be
in contributing to our knowledge of how proteostasis is maintained in eukaryotes and identifying novel
treatment approaches for a wide range of human diseases that arise due to loss of proteostasis."

High affinity class-switched autoantibodies (autoAb) are the major pathogenic effector molecules in lupus. They
are generated by B cells that differentiate through either the germinal center (GC) or the extrafollicular (EF)
pathways. The frequency of follicular helper (Tfh) cells and EF helper (eTf) CD4+ T cells are expanded in lupus
in direct correlation with disease activity. The EF pathway has been best characterized in the MRL/lpr lupus-
prone mice with AM14 BCR Tg B cells, which have been used as a model of autoreactive B cells activated
through dual BCR and TLR9 signals. Overall, the GC and EF pathways are crucial nodes of lupus pathogenesis
and lupus-prone mice present validated models for mechanistic studies of these pathways. We and others have
shown that the metabolism of immune cells was altered in lupus patients and mice, and that some of these
alterations offer therapeutic targets. Relatively little is known on the metabolic programs that sustain either
autoreactive or immunization-induced (Imm-) GC B cells and Tfh cells, and nothing is known about the
metabolism of EF activation. We have shown during the first cycle of funding that the production of anti-dsDNA
IgG but not Imm-Abs, was glucose-dependent. In contrast, both autoAbs and Imm-Abs were eliminated by the
inhibition of glutaminolysis. These results obtained with bulk polyclonal populations treated with metabolic
inhibitors his led us to hypothesize that autoAbs and Imm-Abs have different metabolic requirements through
the GC stage, which could be ultimately translated in their selective targeting. In this competitive renewal, we
propose to use auto- and Imm-Ig-specific B and T cells, as well as GC B and Tact-specific deletions of metabolic
enzymes to determine the intrinsic metabolic requirements of autoreactive and Imm-GC B and Tfh cells at the
antigen- and cell-specific levels. We also propose to address the metabolic requirements of EF activation of
autoreactive B cells. Using unique mouse models and a combination of scRNA-Seq and deep metabolomic
analyses, we propose three specific aims to determine the requirements in glucose (1), glutamine (2), and
FAO (3) for autoAb vs. Imm-Ab production, and to identify the corresponding mechanisms. These
experiments will help to define the specific metabolic requirements of the B and CD4+ T cells that participate in
the production of lupus autoAbs. This knowledge may ultimately identify means to eliminate autoAb production
while preserving protective humoral autoimmunity."

Heart failure after ischemic injury remains a leading cause of death in the United States due to the inability of
adult humans to replace lost cardiac muscle after heart attack. In contrast, newborn mammals possess a
transient but robust capacity for complete functional heart regeneration. Cardiac regeneration in neonatal
rodents relies on the proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes (CM), highlighting the importance of
understanding CM cell cycle regulation. This regenerative capacity is lost shortly after birth when the majority of
CMs undergo cell cycle arrest, polyploidization, and hypertrophic growth. The long-term goal of my proposed
research is to define the physiological triggers that mediate the postnatal loss of mammalian heart regenerative
potential. In this proposal, we build upon our recent discovery demonstrating that combined inhibition of thyroid
hormone (TH) and adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling during postnatal development increases CM proliferation,
delays polyploidization, and promotes heart functional regeneration in older juvenile mice. Despite the
significance of these findings, the cellular and molecular mechanisms downstream of these pathways impacting
CM cell division remain unclear. While TH and AR signaling are known to promote CM hypertrophic growth, the
interrelationship between CM size and cell cycle control is not well understood. Our central hypothesis is that
TH and AR signaling interactions after birth drive CM hypertrophic growth and limits proliferative
potential. We are pioneering the application of digital holographic microscopy to visualize three-dimensional
changes in CM volume in response to hormonal stimulation in real-time with single cell resolution. We are using
this technology to resolve if CM hypertrophic growth inhibits cell cycle progression and division. We will test our
hypothesis in the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how TH and AR signaling interactions promote CM
hypertrophy. Aim 2: Define how TH and AR signaling interactions inhibit CM proliferation. Aim 3: Identify the
molecular targets downstream of TH and AR signaling regulating CM hypertrophy and proliferation. The results of
these studies are expected to reveal new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating the
loss of heart regenerative capacity in mammals, which may help inform novel treatment strategies to improve
heart regenerative capacity in adult humans. This SuRE-First award will fund the research of approximately 40
undergraduates and 8 M.S students over the course of four years, including many minority trainees at San Jose
State University, a primarily undergraduate and Master’s-level institution committed to training
under-represented minority students. Undergraduates will perform the majority of the proposed work, with
training and mentorship from senior graduate students and the PI. This funding would allow the PI to continue to
develop a strong track record in research, give meaningful scientific experiences to undergraduate students,
and strengthen the research environment at San Jose State University."

In population genetics, deep neural networks have largely replaced traditional approaches such
as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and other summary statistic-based methods.
However, there has been a lack of exploration and comparison of different architectures and
input representation of genetic data. Additionally, interpreting trained neural networks and their
predictions remains largely unexplored in this field. In this project we will develop new inference
frameworks based on transformers, and compare these approaches with existing methodology.
We will focus on the challenging task of joint inference, where a locus-specific forces such as
natural selection or per site, per haplotype admixture are confounded by demographic history.
We will create interpretability frameworks that allow researchers to understand what deep
learning methods are learning at multiple scales. Local interpretability will explain network
output on the genetic region level, while global interpretability focuses on individual network
components such as convolutional filters or fully connected layers. Our interpretability methods
will allow us to generate not just predictions and parameter estimates, but higher-level scientific
insight for diverse human populations. Taken together, outcomes from our results will guide
researchers toward the best networks for their inference tasks, quantify evolutionary processes
in admixed populations, and illuminate the reasoning behind network predictions."
10876054,"Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) poses a major clinical problem due to its oftentimes dose-
limiting side effects associated with many commonly employed anti-cancer chemotherapy drugs. The onset of
CIPN severely impacts the quality of life of patients, leading to dosages reductions, treatment delay, and even
discontinuation of the treatment altogether. Abnormal pain sensations mostly in the feet and hands is one of the
main side effects of CIPN. CIPN symptoms can occur prior to reaching the point of causing dose limiting side-
effects causing major discomfort and pain. Paclitaxel (PTX) is among the most commonly used cancer drugs
that cause peripheral neuropathy which is a debilitating and serious dose-limiting side effect in peripheral
neurons. Currently, there are no pharmacological interventions or therapeutic approaches for the treatment of
PTX induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). To identify therapeutic candidates that prevent PIPN, we carried out
a drug screening of FDA approved drugs and identified Fluocinolone acetonide (FA) as a neuroprotective drug
capable of mitigating axonal degeneration induced by PTX in vitro and in vivo. Based on our recent publication,
the neuroprotection effect of FA may have been attributed to enhanced anterograde mitochondrial trafficking.
We demonstrated an innovative imaging method for sub-cellular mitochondria trafficking in neurons that allows
for characterization of anterograde and retrograde trafficking. However, the understanding of how other non-
mitochondrial organelles and their cargos are trafficked in the context of PIPN is yet to be determined. Likewise,
the effect by treatment with FA on non-mitochondria organelle trafficking remains unclear at this time. The
identification of specific trafficking of axonal cargos in PIPN, FA co-treatment conditions, and subsequent
complement findings with associated signaling mechanisms, are necessary to design effective and safe
neuroprotection therapies. In this proposal, we propose 1. To Identify a neuroprotective mechanism of
Mitochondria Trafficking, Fusion and Biogenesis enhanced by FA within the Axon in PIPN. 2. To Identify the
neuroprotective mechanism of FA in trafficking of non-mitochondrial organelles such as lysosomes, golgi and
endoplasmic reticulum in PIPN. The proposed approach will be impactful to identify FA induced directional
trafficking of other neuronal organelles to protect axonal degeneration. The research will also propose
identification of a possible signaling mechanism associated with FA-enhanced neuroprotection. Collectively, our
proposed research will broadly impact the field of characterizing the neuronal subcellular organelle and cargos
at play in promoting development of neuroprotection strategies. This R15 project will also expose several
undergraduate students to research projects and promote the research development and excellence at UNC
Charlotte."

Species from worms to humans show a critical loss of fertility when exposed to elevated temperatures. This
conserved response to temperature stress affects both males and females. Interestingly while every species
tested, including humans, appear to have a thermal limit of fertility below temperatures that lead to death, even
closely related species can have different thermal limits of fertility. What then could be the germline specific
structure/pathway that experiences a conserved temperature sensitive failure, but that the specific temperature
when it fails can be modified? Two possible such structures that are germline specific are the synaptonemal
complex (SC) and germ granules. Both structures are necessary for fertility and exhibit liquid-like properties
that make them inherently structurally temperature sensitive. Notably, proteins within these structures contain
intrinsically disordered domains that contribute to the liquid-like properties of the structures and are also rapidly
evolving. In the model nematode C. elegans, both structures have been shown to have structural failure
around or just above the temperature where C. elegans goes sterile. Using a comparative model of
Caenorhabditis nematodes that have different thermal limits of fertility, we will test if the SC and P granules
(nematode specific germ granules) are the critical structures that fail during high temperature stress. In this
grant we will test the hypothesis that the liquid-like physical properties of the synaptonemal complex and P
granules predisposes them to failure during temperature stress leading to loss of fertility at elevated
temperatures using two Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine how synaptonemal complex stability plays a role in
the thermal limit of fertility. These experiments will specifically add to our understanding how conserved is the
temperature sensitivity of meiotic processes. In Aim 2 we will determine how P granule stability plays a role in
the set point of the thermal limit of fertility. These experiments will add to our understanding of how germ
granules are vulnerable to temperature stress. This work will elucidate why germ cells across species are so
sensitive to increased temperature and help explain why species, including humans, are losing fertility in the
face of climate associate higher temperatures."

Mutation-targeted small molecular inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade or ICB (anti-PD-1 and -CTLA-4
antibodies) have extended the quality and quantity of life for patients with advanced BRAFMUT melanoma. Beyond
ICB, which is ineffective in up to 60% of patients, patients with advanced NRASMUT melanoma have no standard-
of-care options. Due to the rapid onset of resistance, MEK inhibitor (MEKi) monotherapy has limited clinical
activity against NRASMUT melanoma, with the potential exception of those melanoma previously exposed to ICB
(the NEMO trial). Here, we propose to design MEKi-based combinatorial-sequential regimens against advanced
NRASMUT melanoma. First, we will test the concept of priming MEKi responsiveness via anti-PD-1/L1
pretreatment (regardless of anti-PD-1/L1 sensitivity). We will test this concept as well as dissect the mechanisms
of action and innate/acquired resistance in human subjects (by conducting a phase II investigator-initiated trial)
and in syngeneic melanoma models. Second, we will test the concept of combining a next-generation RAF
inhibitor (RAFi) with a MEKi to overcome and to prevent MEKi resistance. These studies will be conducted in
human melanoma cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and syngeneic models. Third, we will test the
concept of overcoming MEKi resistance by pharmacologically exploiting a hallmark vulnerability of resistant
tumors: MEKi-addiction or tumor cell death induced by MEKi withdrawal. Specifically, to induce the regression
of a diverse array of NRASMUT MEKi-resistant PDX models, we will test one strategy involving sequencing from
a MEKi to a poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) or another strategy involving rotations between MEKi
and PARPi. We will also test whether these sequencing/rotational strategies, by inducing various extents of
immunogenic cell death and/or innate immunity, would sensitize NRASMUT melanoma to combined anti-PD-1/L1
therapy. In these clinical and preclinical studies, we will derive multi-omic data and evaluate candidate pathways
to identify predictive biomarkers. In addition to bulk tumor-based, multi-omic analysis (exome, genome,
transcriptome, methylome, chromatin accessibility, proteome, TCR clonotypes) of longitudinal tumor samples,
we will also dissect the single-cell (scRNA-seq, CyTOF) evolution of NRASMUT melanoma to identify additional
combinatorial-sequential targets to overcome and then to prevent resistance. These studies require a close
collaboration with Projects 2 and 3 and Cores A-C at levels of shared technical expertise, reagents/models and
preliminary data, and this collaboration is grounded on a 10-year track record of joint publications that have
resulted in deep insights into clinically relevant melanoma biology, multiple clinical trials and even approved
therapies. The combination of oncology and dermatology expertise (Ribas and Lo) and laboratories with
complementary approaches (Ribas, Lo, Graeber) promises to accelerate scientific concepts to clinical testing."
10878832,"PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT
Melanoma treatment has had instrumental advances in two modern modalities: immunotherapy and targeted
kinase inhibitor treatments. Nevertheless, there is a crucial clinical need to address dedifferentiation as a
resistance mechanism to modern melanoma therapies. Notably, dedifferentiation is a documented cross-
resistance mechanism that impacts both of the new expanding standards of care: BRAF and MEK kinase inhibitor
therapies, and immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (e.g. anti-PD-1/PD-L1). Our discovery of
a new dedifferentiation-associated sensitivity to iron-dependent oxidative stress (ferroptosis), provides a new
angle from which to complement current standard of care therapies for melanoma. In our studies, sensitivity to
ferroptosis is an Achilles heel for dedifferentiated cells independent of whether they were dedifferentiated at
baseline, or induced to dedifferentiate by BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy or by immunotherapy associated
cytokines. Thus, using preclinical models, we will further pursue this orthogonal sensitivity to prevent the
dedifferentiation escape route.
Our discovery and proposed experiments brings the programmed cell death process of ferroptosis into the field
of melanoma and melanocytes. We will investigate how the redox stress protection mechanisms specific to
redox-regulated melanin production in melanocytes interact with iron metabolism, ferritinophagy and ferroptosis
in melanoma cells. Studies in the melanoma and melanocyte context will help advance our knowledge of this
relatively recently discovered cell death mechanism. We will test the efficacy of combining ferroptosis induction
with either kinase inhibitor therapy, or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy using preclinical models. We will
interrogate human samples from clinical trials to assess the immunotherapy contexts in which dedifferentiation
presents the highest clinical challenge and opportunity. Our discovery of dedifferentiation-linked ferroptosis
sensitivity was the result of an integrative genomics and pharmacogenomics approach. We will continue to
expand our framework of the regulation of melanoma dedifferentiation using integrative genomics to delineate
transcription and epigenetic regulatory programs. To expand upon the multiple links between metabolism, redox
buffering, differentiation, and ferroptosis, we will incorporate metabolomics and lipidomics in our discovery and
mechanistic delineation approaches. Our goal in these aims is to mechanistically understand and enhance the
therapeutic approach of targeting the melanoma dedifferentiation resistance escape route."
10878835,"PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT
We have started to make progress in defining mechanisms that lead to primary and acquired resistance to anti-
PD-1/L1 therapy at the molecular level. In this Project, we propose to characterize their biology, discover how
to overcome resistance based on mechanistic understanding, and study how this knowledge can improve
patient care. In Aim 1, we will develop in vitro and in vivo models to study the biology of molecularly-defined
resistance mechanisms with the goal of providing full mechanistic understanding of how they mediate
resistance. This is based on our discovery of homozygous loss of function (LoF) mutations in the interferon
(IFN) receptor pathway and in the antigen presenting machinery (APM) in biopsies of patients with primary and
acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy, both confirmed with data from other groups. With this
information, we will be in the position to test combination approaches to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/L1
therapy. These include approaches aimed at inducing a local IFN response that may activate this pathway
downstream, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) or MDA5 agonists in JAK1/2 knockout models, and activating
natural killer (NK) cells in B2M knockout models. In Aim 2, we will study a new cancer cell-intrinsic
mechanisms of T cell exclusion mediated by the expression of the p21 associated kinase 4 (PAK4), which we
have recently uncovered by comparing gene expression in T cell-rich versus T cell-poor biopsies of patients
with melanoma on therapy with anti-PD-1. We will examine the mechanisms leading to T cell exclusion
induced by PAK4 in mouse models, and we will analyze the mechanisms in biopsies obtained from patients
enrolled in a clinical trial combining the PAK4 inhibitor KPT-9274 and the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab.
Sample analyses for the two aims will benefit from the collaboration with investigators from the other two
projects and cores of this P01. In conclusion, this Project will analyze defined mechanisms of therapeutic
resistance to cancer immunotherapy to provide improved understanding on their effects, and show how to
overcome the resistance using rationally designed combination studies.

Obesity is associated with serious medical complications and responsible for a rising percentage of health care
costs in the United States. While most anti-obesity drugs in the market work by suppressing appetite,
increasing energy expenditure by stimulating thermogenesis is an alternative strategy. Humans and mice both
possess constitutively active and inducible thermogenic fat, commonly called brown and beige fat. While
Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) has long been considered essential for non-shivering thermogenesis in adipose
tissues, recent studies have demonstrated UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms, and they may be
especially important in beige fat. We recently identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein
Nnat as a novel inhibitor of adipocyte thermogenesis and have shown that its effects on thermogenesis are
UCP1-independent. We hypothesize that Nnat in adipose tissue plays a key role in controlling thermogenesis
and glucose homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the regulation of systemic energy metabolism by
adipose tissue Nnat. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanistic basis of Nnat action and will examine its
interactions with the ER calcium pump SERCA and other possible ways that Nnat can impact thermogenesis.
These studies will produce new insights into the control of adipose tissue thermogenesis and potentially lead to
new strategies for anti-obesity therapy."

 Spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis affects more than 250,000 people nationwide with over
12,000 new cases each year. More than half of all SCIs occur at cervical levels resulting in paralysis
below the neck with less than 1% achieving full recovery. Paralysis results in a loss of independence,
and the need for caregiver assistants to perform activities of daily living. This loss of independence
adds to the emotional, financial, and family burden of this chronic condition.
 Hardware is now available that holds the potential to restore lost arm function after spinal cord
injury. Specifically, tiny arrays of implanted intracortical microelectrode are able to detect the neural
firing patterns in the areas of the brain responsible for producing reaching movements. Also
implanted stimulating electrodes implanted on or near the peripheral nerves are able to reanimate
muscles after paralysis. Combining these implanted recording and stimulation technologies holds the
potential to restore arm movement controlled by one's own thoughts. However, much work is needed
to refine the control algorithms that translate the brain signals into the stimulation patterns needed to
make the desired movements.
 This study will evaluate three methods of improving control algorithms for restoring reaching in
both human and animal models. Specifically we are exploring options for controlling not only the
motion of the limb, but also how well the limb resists perturbations from external forces. Increasing
limb `stiffness' by activating opposing or `antagonist' muscles will help to stiffen and stabilize the limb
making it resistant to unintended movement if bumped. In the first method, we are incorporating
automated stiffness control based on context (i.e. limb stiffness is modulated based on the intended
speed and acceleration/deceleration we decode from the brain signals). In the second method, we
will extract a separate `stiffness' command signal from the brain and use that cortically-derived
command to adjust limb stiffness in real time. In the third method, we put individual recorded neurons
in direct control of the muscle stimulators using a simple linear brain-to-muscle-stimulator mapping.
This method puts the brain in charge of learning with practice how to optimize muscle activation to
modulate stiffness as needed. Optimizing how stimulation is delivered to control stiffness is important
for practical use of this technology because too little stiffness will allow the arm to be easily bumped
off course whereas more stiffness than is needed will waste stimulator batteries and can cause
muscle fatigue."

This new R21 application is submitted in response to RFA-OD-21-007 (INvestigation of Co-occurring
conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE (INCLUDE).
 The overarching goal of this pilot study is to apply and evaluate [18F]-BCPP-EF Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) imaging for the in vivo assessment of Mitochondrial Complex I (MC-I) function in
individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Impairment or disruption of the electron transport chain (ETC) is
common in several neurodegenerative diseases. Research has shown that alterations in mitochondrial
ATP production and redox homeostasis (that strongly supports neural function) are associated with DS
and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The Mitochondrial Complex I (MC-I) is the first enzyme
complex of the ETC that plays an important role in oxidative phosphorylation and radical oxygen
species (ROS) generation in mitochondria, and it is the largest complex in the respiratory chain. As a
result, there is much interest in potential therapeutics for DS that target MC-I.
 [18F]-BCPP-EF has been developed as a high-affinity PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of MC-I
activity. Prior [18F]-BCPP-EF studies showed its feasibility for in vivo human imaging and robust test-
retest performance in healthy controls. [18F]-BCPP-EF studies in mild AD subjects yielded evidence of:
[1] reduced MC-I activity in cortical and subcortical brain areas; [2] mitochondrial-related energy failure
preceding glycolysis-related FDG hypometabolism in the parahippocampus; and [3] links between
reductions in MC-I activity and hypometabolism, atrophy, and cognitive decline, but not Aβ load.
Recent [18F]-BCPP-EF studies provide a strong basis for future MC-I imaging studies in DS.
 Our primary aim is to perform [18F]-BCPP-EF PET imaging in DS individuals and control participants
and map the distribution of MC-I activity throughout DS brain and relative to that observed in control
subjects. We hypothesize that MC-I activity will be reduced in cortical and subcortical regions of DS
subjects (relative to controls) in a manner that exceeds differences in cerebral atrophy. We will generate
quantitative and simplified regional [18F]-BCPP-EF outcomes to evaluate the kinetics of nonspecific
uptake, and further evaluate potential reference regions (as it appears that no region is fully devoid of MC-
I and cerebellum is an area for which atrophy can be extensive in DS). Maps of MC-I activity will be
generated for the DS and controls subjects and corresponding difference maps will be evaluated.
Innovation, Impact, Significance: [18F]-BCPP-EF PET imaging in Down syndrome is novel and, to our
knowledge, has not yet been demonstrated. This pilot research (and data sharing) has the potential to: [1]
provide new in vivo evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in DS; [2] support future advanced R01
research of mitochondrial energetics in DS; and [3] further inform drug discovery efforts that target MC-I."
10887630,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This R35 program aims to delineate a previously unappreciated role of Piezo1 mechanosensitive ion
channels in regulating cellular activity under inflammatory conditions using articular chondrocytes (ACs) as a
model system. Mechanotransduction is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous process, and virtually all mammalian
cells exhibit rapid and robust ion influx upon mechanical stimulus. In disease states, cells present abnormal
mechanotransduction revealed by altered mechanosensitivity and biochemical transduction. Piezo1 is a
novel mechanically-activated (MA) Ca2+-permeating channel abundantly expressed in cardiovascular, musculo-
skeletal, and neural tissues. Augmented functional expression of Piezo1 in ACs is associated with cartilage
disorders. Interestingly, ACs present a morphological differentiation from spherical ACs to cells with point-like
processes in osteoarthritis. The actin filament (F-actin) networks have been focused on understanding morpho-
logical differentiation and mechanical stability of AC, yet our preliminary data suggest a potential role of Piezo1
in F-actin remodeling in process formation under IL1α-mediated inflammatory conditions.
 Here, we propose a paradigm-shifting concept of Piezo1-mediated morphological changes and pro-
cess formation in inflammatory conditions. Both mechanotransduction and inflammation influence or are re-
sponsible for a wide array of physiological processes and abnormalities. A knowledge gap exists in the mecha-
notransduction-inflammation coupling, morphology-dependent cellular mechanosensitivity, Piezo1-mediated
morphological changes, Piezo1 localization on the membrane cortex of round-shape ACs, and Piezo1-recruit-
ment in processes of fibroblast-like shaped ACs. This proposed program will identify: (i) if activated Piezo1 al-
ters local membrane curvature and triggers to form cellular protrusions and reorganize cytoskeleton meshwork,
(ii) specific inflammatory cytokines triggering morphological changes and augmenting Piezo1 channels in pro-
cesses, which in turn altering the gating properties of Piezo1, and (iii) if Piezo1-mediated inflammatory re-
sponse increases mechanical fatigue and death. The whole-cell patch-clamp method allows to record ion
channel activities, yet ACs present technical challenges on sealing the membrane primarily due to their round
morphology and small size (~10 μm in diameter). Thus, we have custom-built a novel microscopy, named
‘Mechano-microscopy’, by combining an atomic force microscope (AFM), a high-speed ratiometric Ca2+ im-
aging microscope, and a confocal microscope to simultaneously record cellular morphology and biochemical
signals in response to mechanical cues under inflammatory conditions. In addition, we will utilize the super-
resolution STED microscope and Piezo1-TdTomato reporter mice to interrogate dynamics of membrane curva-
ture and Piezo1 localization in ACs after treating specific inflammatory cytokines.
 Our program will conceptually unveil fundamental processes of Piezo1-dependent inflammatory re-
sponses leading to cellular morphological differentiation. In addition, our results will provide new insights into
the mechanotransduction-inflammation coupling mechanisms and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent
morphology changes at the early stages of cartilage disorders."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heritable autoimmune disease that primarily affects young females.
SLE symptoms can be very heterogeneous, which posts great challenges in early diagnosis. In its advanced
stages, SLE can lead to multiple organ failures and even fatality. Early diagnosis is critical for controlling and
mitigating the symptoms and improving the quality of life. Genome-wide association studies of SLE to date
have identified >150 loci. Yet, the causal variants remain elusive for most loci. There is great interest to integrate
datasets from diverse human populations to further empower discovery, refine causal variants, and improve
the risk prediction accuracy. In this proposal, we seek to aggregate available GWAS summary statistics from a
myriad of autoimmune diseases. We will develop improved meta-analysis methods that effectively integrate
data from multiple traits and ancestries. We will also develop better fine-mapping methods that can integrate
statistical approaches and experimental validations. Finally, we will develop more accurate genetic risk scores
using datasets from multiple ancestries and traits, and combine them with commonly used lab values for
improved disease risk predictions. We will release useful software packages implementing these methods to
benefit studies of other traits and maximize the impact of the proposed research."

The purpose of this study is to examine alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias (ADRD). Approximately 40% of risk for dementia has been attributed to modifiable risk
factors, with heavy alcohol use in midlife (12+ standard US drinks weekly) added to the list of risk factors by
the Lancet Commission in 2020. It is well established that more women have ADRD and men have higher
rates of heavy drinking, yet alcohol-related problems occur at lower levels of consumption for women than for
men. Moreover, the APOE gene, one of the strongest genetic risk factors for ADRD, begins to increase risk for
women who have only one e4 allele but for men increased risk is only seen in those who have two e4 alleles.
Prior research has also been mixed as to whether APOE interacts with alcohol consumption to increase risk for
ADRD. This exploratory/developmental project will examine the relationships of midlife alcohol use and APOE
in over 32,000 male and female twins from the Swedish Twin Registry who have lifetime alcohol consumption
data and clinical or registry-based diagnoses of ADRD, plus APOE genotypes in over 8,000 twins, thus making
it possible to detect phenotypic relationships as well as additive (i.e. G+E) and interactive (i.e. GxE) genetic
and environmental relationships. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will delineate the relationship of mid-life alcohol
consumption with late-life ADRD diagnosis and age of onset, paying particular attention to whether these
relationships are similar in men and women. We will also explore whether incorporating alcohol consumption
levels from earlier and later adulthood adds to our understanding of alcohol consumption as a lifecourse risk
factor for ADRD. In Aim 2, we will test the alcohol consumption-APOE risk relationship with ADRD diagnosis
and age of onset, again focusing on sex differences in elucidating these relationships. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
leverage the genetically informative design of the Swedish Twin Registry to characterize differences in alcohol
involvement within ADRD discordant and concordant monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs of both sexes,
thereby better understanding genetic contributions to alcohol-ADRD associations. This exploratory/
developmental research study will have the power to model alcohol risk for ADRD in nuanced ways and
broaden our understanding of how and why alcohol may affect ADRD risk. If successful, it will set the stage for
us to incorporate alcohol consumption as a risk factor for ADRD in more sophisticated models in future work."

PROJECT SUMMARY
 In the US, cancer disproportionately affects many racial/ethnic minority communities, defining significant
cancer health disparities (CHDs). Across all racial/ethnic groups, American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AIANs)
experience one of the most substantial disparities with the highest comorbidity rates and lowest 5-year survival
rates for all major cancer types. CHDs are driven by a combination of biological and social determinants of
health, but actionable knowledge of both elements remains severely limited for AIANs. In this K99 proposal, I
will address two critical problems that have perpetuated CHDs among American Indians/Alaskan Natives
(AIANs): underrepresentation in precision medicine that limits discovery translation and race-level trends for
outcomes and SDOH that conceal community diversity critical to effective implementation. Neither issue can be
successfully addressed without the involvement and voices of Native communities, who have long been
subjected to extractive research practices with little to no return on community health. This proposal centers
Native communities living within the UCD Comprehensive Cancer Center catchment area (UCDCCC-CA) in a
community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework to develop guidelines for appropriate Native
community engagement for biomedical research while assessing community-level biological and social
determinants of cancer health and care access. In Aim 1, I will utilize whole exome sequencing data from 300
Hispanic/Latino (HL) gastric cancer samples to identify somatic alterations that are associated with Indigenous
American (IA) genetic ancestry at both global and local ancestry levels. These may be applicable to AIANs who
also share high IA ancestry. Associated loci will be functionally validated in HL patient-derived organoid models
in the R00 phase. In Aim 2, I will administer a validated survey and conducted focus groups interviews to identify
key factors that contribute to individual decision-making for participation and biospecimen donation in cancer
research among AIANs. In the R00 phase, I will work with UCDCCC-CA Native community stakeholders and my
Native community advisory board to translate these findings into Native community engagement guidelines for
research. In Aim 3, I will utilize cancer risk and health behavior data from the Aim 2 survey and cancer outcomes
and sociodemographic data from the California Cancer Registry to elucidate community-level social determinant
of health that drive UCDCCC-CA Native community cancer outcomes. In the R00 phase, I will use these findings
to identify areas of intervention in collaboration with community and Native-focused health clinic partners to
improve Native community cancer health. This proposal fulfills the mission of the National Institute for Minority
Health and Health Disparities to understand and reduce health disparities. The results of this proposal will
increase understanding of biological vulnerabilities and social determinants of health that lead to greater cancer
incidence and mortality among AIANs, while creating the infrastructure to ethically engage Native communities
and increase their participation in cancer research."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S. and worldwide. Identifying
genetic risk factors and uncovering the underlying biological processes will lead to the development of much
needed new avenues for therapies. Decades of genetics research, especially genome wide association studies
(GWAS), have led to the discovery of numerous genetic loci associated with an increased risk for CAD.
However, the majority of these loci lie in non-protein-coding regions. Efforts are needed to identify causal
genes associated with these loci and the underlying cellular processes and signaling pathways. Recent
advances in epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling at unprecedented depth and resolution, along with
targeted genome/epigenome editing provide new opportunities to identify specific genes and cellular
mechanisms in CAD.
 This K08 career development award is designed to launch the principal investigator’s career as an
independent physician scientist that utilizes complementary computational and molecular approaches to
discover the mechanisms that underlies human genetic risk to cardiovascular disease and translates these
findings into treatment. The principal investigator ‘s Mentor (Thomas Quertermous) is a world leader in
mechanistic studies of genetic risk of atherosclerosis. The proposed training is further supplemented by an
advisory committee of leaders in computational biology, genetics, and single-cell multi-omic analysis, including
Michael Snyder, Erik Ingelsson, William Greenleef, and Siddhartha Jaiswal, along with formal didactic courses
at Stanford University and Cold Spring Harbor.
 Funded by an F32, the principle investigator used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models of
atherosclerosis and linked the non-coding CAD risk loci at 2q22 to ZEB2, a transcriptional repressor with a
critical role in cell-state transitions. ZEB2 appears to be specifically up-regulated in phenotypically modulated
smooth muscle cells (SMC) in atherosclerotic lesions, and modulates their cell-fate decisions. The proposed
study will: (1) identify the causal regulatory element(s) responsible for the CAD-Risk-associated region at 2q22;
(2) reveal the molecular mechanisms by which ZEB2 affects phenotypic modulation of SMC; (3) determine the
cellular mechanism by which perturbation of smooth muscle cell Zeb2 expression modulates atherosclerotic
lesions in vivo. The result of this study will elucidate new regulatory mechanisms that modulate atherosclerosis
biology. Additionally, the principle investigator will gain the training needed to transition into an independent
physician scientist focusing on translating genetic findings of human cardiovascular disease into specific
mechanisms and novel therapies."

Expression of the recently discovered human restriction factor SAMHD1 is responsible for the infection
block imposed to lentiviruses such as HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVmac by primary macrophages, dendritic cells and
resting CD4+ T-cells. SAMHD1 blocks lentiviral infection by preventing the occurrence of reverse transcription.
SAMHD1 has deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) activity, which degrades deoxynucleotide
triphosphates (dNTPs) into nucleotides and triphosphates, and this activity is required for HIV-1 restriction.
However, additional studies have revealed that the dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 is not sufficient for HIV-1
restriction. Thus, an additional property of SAMHD1 is required for HIV-1 restriction. SAMHD1 interacts with
nucleic acids in vitro, but the contribution of this interaction to HIV-1 restriction in vivo remains to be
determined. Our preliminary data using SAMHD1 mutants indicate that nucleic acid binding is important for
HIV-1 restriction. We determined the structure of SAMHD1 bound to an oligodeoxynucleotide and leveraged
this structure as a tool for structure-function studies. Several amino acids form the interface between SAMHD1
and the oligodeoxynucleotide, and mutation of these residues resulted in SAMHD1 proteins that are unable to
restrict HIV-1. These results suggest that the ability of SAMHD1 to interact with nucleic acids is important for
HIV-1 restriction. Separate from its antiviral activity, mutations in the human SAMHD1 gene cause Aicardi-
Goutières syndrome (AGS). AGS patients exhibit increased levels of type I interferon (IFN) that are believed to
result from the recognition of endogenous nucleic acids by innate immune sensors. Thus, it has been
suggested that the in vivo role of SAMHD1 is to prevent activation of the innate immune response by
endogenous nucleic acids, and the nucleic acid binding activity of SAMHD1 has been suggested to be
important for this function. Our preliminary data indicate that SAMHD1 knockout (KO) mice are resistant to
herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2)-induced limb paralysis and death. These results suggest that SAMHD1
prevents the recognition of HSV-2 by innate immune sensors, potentially by interacting with the HSV-2 viral
DNA and shielding it from detection. This strong phenotype in vivo will be used to unveil the role of SAMHD1 in
innate immunity. Based on these published and preliminary results, the central hypothesis of this proposal
is that the interaction of SAMHD1 with nucleic acids is important for its antiviral and innate immune
functions. Our rationale is that identification of the mechanisms by which SAMHD1 modulates viral infection
and innate immune responses will enable the development of novel antiviral and AGS therapies. To test our
central hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which SAMHD1
inhibits HIV-1 infection, 2) Evaluate the role of SAMHD1 acetylation in SAMHD1-mediated viral restriction, and
3) Characterize the role of SAMHD1 in innate immunity."
10888167,"Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer due to its rapid progression,
resistance to therapy, and a high rate of metastatic spread. A common site of metastases is the peritoneal
cavity that occurs in 40-50% of patients and leads to development of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). PC is
almost a universally lethal diagnosis with survival of less than 6 months due to limited therapeutic options that
are currently available. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a fundamental property of GAC that contributes to
therapy resistance, disease progression and metastasis. We and others have characterized the genomic and
molecular ITH in GAC and PC, however, tumor cell lineage plasticity−the non-genetic, cell intrinsic origin of ITH
remains poorly understood. In our preliminary efforts to dissect the cellular and molecular ITH using single-cell
analysis, we discovered that the diversity in tumor cell lineage/state compositions appears to be an upstream
key regulator of phenotypic ITH of PC, beyond the genetic factors. We also find that tumors classified based on
tumor cell lineage/state compositions (cellular subtypes) are strongly associated with survival, exhibiting
differential activation of oncogenic pathways and distinct immune phenotypes. We therefore hypothesize that
tumor cell lineages/states dynamically evolve to resist treatment and promote tumor growth and its composition
determines phenotypes and outcomes of GACs. The goal of Aim 1 is to characterize tumor cell lineage/state
diversity and compositions in clinically defined GAC cohorts, determine their impacts on tumor cell clonal
evolution, and identity lineage features associated with GAC progression and metastasis. We will also profile
changes in tumor cell lineages and states in paired baseline and progressive tumors following chemotherapy
or immunotherapy, determine their impact on immune phenotypes and patient responses to anti-cancer
therapies, and identify lineage features associated with therapy resistance. In Aim 2, we will leverage our
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of GAC, follow the expansion and dissemination of cancer
cells in GEMMs over a period of time to longitudinally track and characterize dynamic changes in tumor cell
lineage identity and transcriptome states at single-cell resolution. We will investigate the clonal architecture of
tumor cells in different lineages/states and examine the dynamics of clonal populations that sustain tumor
growth at the primary sites, seed and colonize distant organs; we will also profile how tumor cells in different
lineages interact with TIME at the primary tumor site and influence invasion and dissemination. In Aim 3, we
will investigate tumor cell lineage plasticity in response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in GEMMs. We
will characterize therapy-induced emergence of resistant cell lineages/states and identify the fundamental
pathways and drivers of lineage/state transition. This study will link tumor cell lineage/state plasticity to GAC
therapy resistance, progression, and metastasis. A better understanding of sources of phenotype
heterogeneity and dynamics underlying GAC progression is paramount to identifying effective treatments."

Adoptive cellular immunotherapy utilizing T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has shown
durable clinical responses in hematologic malignancies. However, relapse remains a challenge, urging for better
CAR designs. CAR, analogous to the T cell receptor (TCR), is specifically engineered to redirect T cell specificity
towards tumor antigens. Optimal regulation on TCR dynamics is crucial for proper TCR function. Altered
dynamics of TCR leads to disfunction or even immune disorders. While the importance of control TCR dynamics
has been well established, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies focusing specifically on CAR
dynamics, including endocytosis, recycling/degradation, and its impact on CAR-T function. My previous work
demonstrated that modulating molecular dynamics of CAR greatly improves CAR-T function. By utilizing the
endocytic feature of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) cytoplasmic tail (CCT), I
reprogrammed CAR dynamics and substantially enhanced CAR-T efficacy in vivo. To control CAR dynamics
more precisely and elucidate its impact on CAR-T function, further modulation on CCT fusion and investigation
on cell-intrinsic regulators to control CAR dynamics are needed. In Aim 1 of this K99/R00 application, I propose
to identify the optimal position and functional motif of CCT fusion. Completion of this aim will not only develop a
novel CAR engineering approach but also provide a deeper understanding of how altering CAR dynamics
contributes to improved CAR-T function. In Aim 2, I plan to uncover cell-intrinsic regulator of CAR dynamics
using CRISPR-based gene perturbation. This aim will serve to fill the gap in our understanding of the improved
anti-tumor efficacy of CAR-CCT but also uncover novel regulators on CTLA-4 dynamics. In Aim 3, I propose to
develop self-regulated CAR with CCT fusion in response to antigen stimulation. This novel engineer approach
will enable precise control over the timing and duration of CAR signaling, which is crucial for maintaining CAR-
T efficacy with limited toxicity. All aims center on engineering CAR dynamics with CCT fusion to develop novel
immunotherapies. The innovative insights and versatile engineering approach proposed in this study will also
contribute significantly to addressing the existing knowledge gap in CAR engineering. This grant will facilitate my
career development during both the postdoctoral training phase and transition phase as an independent faculty
and group leader."

As cannabis becomes legalized in regions around the country, developing effective treatments for Cannabis
Use Disorder (CUD) becomes increasingly important. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) holds
promise as an augment to existing behavioral treatments. Based on recent work in internet gaming disorder by
our team, enhancement of regulation skills through TDCS of the Dorso-lateral Prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may
constitute a helpful treatment for addictive behaviors. Pairing TDCS of the DLPFC with specific training in
reappraisal may further help individuals regulate craving by enhancing effectiveness of training in the beneficial
emotional regulation strategy of reappraisal. Thus, the goal of this work is to examine if neurostimulation paired
with reappraisal training may enhance emotional regulation, resulting in a reduction of cannabis use coupled
with change in EEG correlates of regulation. Sixty participants will be recruited and assigned to either receive
real or sham TDCS alongside reappraisal training in 5 weekly single 20-minute sessions using a double-blind
design. Cannabis use will be measured daily using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for the duration
of the month. Use of EMA technique will allow us to obtain detailed cannabis use information and determine
any change in use patterns. Further, we will examine EEG correlates of regulation of craving, using the
regulation of craving task, after TDCS at the first and final visit. Use of EEG during the regulation of craving
task post-stimulation at baseline and post-treatment will allow us to determine if DLPFC stimulation results in
enhancement of reappraisal coupled with both reduction in self-report of craving to cannabis images and
changes in EEG correlates of regulatory control and reactivity while participants attempt to regulate their
craving. We predict that real, as opposed to sham, TDCS will be associated with reduction in cannabis use as
measured by EMA, along with reductions in self-reported craving and enhancement of EEG correlates of
regulation at the final visit. If our predictions hold, findings will serve as important proof-of-concept data on the
effectiveness of TDCS in tandem with reappraisal training as a potential treatment augment for CUD as well as
elucidating potential mechanisms by which TDCS works. These data will set the stage for future work in larger
samples and longer durations investigating TDCS as a method to augment treatment for CUD."

 The negative health outcomes associated with poor sleep health, including insufficient duration of sleep
and chronic insomnia, have been well documented. These outcomes include an elevated risk for cognitive
decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The combination of insomnia with short sleep duration may elevate the risk
for cognitive impairments and Alzheimer’s disease even further, given the growing literature linking this
particular insomnia phenotype with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, both of
which have been linked to cognitive decline risk. However, the direct connection between biological pathways
disrupted in short sleep insomnia and Alzheimer’s disease is not well understood, and only limited
experimental sleep deprivation research has tried to identify changes in Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers
indicating neuronal degeneration. The current proposal seeks to address this gap in knowledge. With training
from, and collaborations with several experts in sleep research, biostatistical, multi-omics, metabolomics
analyses, and Alzheimer’s disease research, the applicant will gain the expertise needed to address these
questions. By utilizing an interdisciplinary approach incorporating complex data analytics, the project aims to
generate a broad range of independent research. The project has three main aims. In the first aim, we will use
a multi-omics approach analyzing both methylation and metabolomics data and the associated with short sleep
and insomnia, independently and interacting, among a high-risk Hispanic population. Then, we will compare
the results from aim 1 to previously identified methylation and metabolomics biomarkers for Alzheimer’s
disease to identify overlapping pathways. The second aim is to determine the direct relationship between
partial sleep deprivation and the presence of metabolites and blood-based Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers.
For this, we will use an experimental design, namely individuals undergoing a partial sleep deprivation
experiment, and analyze changes among these biomarkers using advanced bioinformatic tools to identify
underlying pathways. The final and third aim will integrate the results from the first aims and decipher the
causal effect of short sleep and insomnia on Alzheimer’s disease and then identify the mediating effects of the
biomarkers identified in the earlier projects. This study will be, by far, the largest study to date to utilize novel,
innovative multi-omics, and bioinformatics approaches to study short sleep insomnia. Addressing a critical
need, we will identify underlying biological pathways affected by insomnia and short sleep and characterize its
connection to Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative processes. This research can critically
inform future research on potential therapeutic targets, especially for a population with known health
disparities."

Endometriosis affects 10-15% of women, causing musculoskeletal pain, bowel and bladder problems, mood
disorders, and infertility. Chronic pelvic pain is the most common symptom affecting 57.2% of patients.
Endometriosis is responsible for an estimated $69.4 billion per year in excess health expenditures, and
significant loss of workplace and household productivity. Current strategies to treat endometriosis, such as
hormonal therapy or surgery, often fail to prevent recurrence and the associated pain. Therefore, we must
develop, test, and implement new strategies to treat this condition. Given the broad impact of endometriosis-
associated pelvic pain on multiple domains of life, we developed the Peer Empowered Endometriosis Pain
Support (PEEPS) intervention that is comprised of three evidence-based approaches: interdisciplinary and
integrated care delivered in a group care model.
The PEEPS intervention was adapted from Chao et al.’s Centering Chronic Pelvic Pain group care program by
our team of a physical therapist, yoga instructor, clinical psychologist, and endometriosis specialist. Adaptation
was informed by implementation science and community engaged research methods. Through this process,
we optimized PEEPS to an 8-session group care program that incorporates education on endometriosis,
physical therapy, mindfulness, yoga, nutrition, and strategies to cope with chronic pain. We hypothesize that
PEEPS will lead to decreased endometriosis-associated pain interference, improved quality of life, and
decreased pain catastrophizing.
To determine PEEPS preliminary effectiveness, I propose to perform a pilot single-site randomized controlled
trial of PEEPS to education. I hypothesize that patients in PEEPS will show greater decrease in pain
interference in daily activities than those in the education arm. With 30 patients in the PEEPS arm and 30 in
the education arm, this pilot trial may be powered to detect an effect size of 0.8 based on the effectiveness of
the intervention components. In parallel to the randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate barriers, facilitators,
and implementability of PEEPS. Most research and evidence-based interventions never reach patients and
clinical practice. As PEEPS is comprised of several effective interventions that have a high probability of
synergistically improving participant symptoms, we will use an implementation science approach in order to
understand how to most effectively translate PEEPS to real-world practice. I will use the data and experiences
I gain in conducting this single-site randomized controlled trial to optimize PEEPS and apply for R01-level
funding to scale up the intervention and perform a multi-site randomized controlled trial."

Nearly 6 million U.S. adults are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and 700,000 of these people will
die in 2019 alone. There is no simple solution for prevention, early detection, or cure. Since 1994, the Adult
Changes in Thought (ACT) study has collected observational, clinical, and laboratory data on more than 5,500
older adults and is following them over time for signs of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. ACT data
contribute to a living, learning laboratory, which serves as a scientific resource for the research community. For
the past seven years, we have held an annual ACT symposium to showcase new ACT resources, highlight
innovative research findings, share new grant ideas, and promote cross-disciplinary collaborations. Every year
we have received higher ratings on our post-symposium evaluations, with 98% of last year’s attendees
indicating they would recommend the symposium to others and 100% indicating they would attend a future
ACT symposium. However, we do not have the capacity to hold future symposia without conference grant
funding. This conference grant will provide support to continue and grow the ACT symposia over the next five
years. The specific objectives of our conference grant are to: 1) promote scientific use and understanding of
ACT data; 2) promote collaborations across scientific disciplines, institutions, and studies; and 3) provide
opportunities for feedback on ongoing and planned work such as analyses-in-progress or new grant ideas,
particularly for junior investigators. This funding will allow us to host the symposium in a large, accessible
venue with advanced audiovisual equipment. It also will provide travel stipends for junior researchers,
investigators from underrepresented minority groups, and researchers traveling from out of town so that we
may extend our reach to new external investigators. Future conferences will cover critical topics in aging and
dementia research such as resilience, imaging, dementia subtypes, molecular phenotypes, traumatic brain
injury, and others. Long term, continuing and expanding the ACT symposia will increase use of the ACT living
laboratory and provide a creative, welcoming space for top investigators to exchange innovative research
ideas and accelerate AD and brain aging research."

The annual Short Course on the Genetics of Addiction proposed in this application builds on the successes of
the previous iteration of this Course and will provide students with an opportunity to learn about genetic
applications and approaches to drug addiction research in humans and model organisms. The methodological
instruction includes examples, literature and data sets drawn from studies of addiction-related phenotypes,
plenary sessions on major progress in addiction genetics, and discussion sessions in which students each
present their work on applications of genetic methods, and discuss general questions provoked by the lectures.
Students will leave the course able to design and interpret genetic and genomic studies of addiction as they
relate to their specific research question, to locate the opportunities and resources for extrapolation between
human genetics and model organisms, and to utilize current online data resources to support their research.
These aims will be accomplished annually over the next five years through an intensive five-day course to be
offered in late summer at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 2020, the course will be held
September 20-26, with arrivals and a reception on September 20 and departures on September 26.
Participants will be chosen for their outstanding research potential in fields relevant to the course and will have
the opportunity to interact with a group of prominent computational biologists, bioinformaticists, biologists, and
geneticists from JAX and other institutions. A combination of didactic sessions and hands-on training will be
offered during the day and informal discussions will be held in the evening. Student enrollment is deliberately
kept small (35) to achieve a desirable level of student-faculty interaction. Food and lodging will be provided at
the JAX-owned Highseas Conference Center, which creates an atmosphere highly conducive to interactions
between students and faculty. A major emphasis will be placed on attracting promising young investigators to
participate in this course and to actively promote the inclusion of women and under-represented minorities in
an effort to cultivate diversity in the professoriate."
10889054,"Project Summary/Abstract
Caregiving for a spouse with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) is extremely stressful and
often prolonged, ranging from 3.3 and 11.7 years. For many caregivers, this period serves as a “living
bereavement,” or a time of grieving the loved one they once knew before the ADRD progression. Heightened
inflammation and its associated sickness behaviors may negatively influence caregiver’s health and quality of
life. Low heart rate variability (HRV) reflects poor vagal tone, or a diminished capacity to emotionally and
physiologically recover from stress and engage in one’s social environment, which could negatively impact
their ability to give care. However, it is unknown whether interventions aimed at improving caregiver grief,
inflammation, and HRV among ADRD spousal caregivers are feasible or effective. Guided by the NIH Stage
Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, the candidate’s past research in Stage 0 informs the Stage 1
& Stage 2 research proposed here, providing valuable training in translating observational research findings
into intervention development, and testing for preliminary efficacy. These studies will lay the groundwork for a
future NIH-funded randomized control trial (R01 application submitted in Year 5) to test the efficacy of the
targeted writing intervention in decreasing caregiving grief, improving HRV, reducing inflammation and
sickness behaviors, and improving quality of life and caregiving self-efficacy among ADRD spousal caregivers.
Training activities specifically designed to coincide with the proposed project will be accomplished through a
combination of formal coursework, mentorship with directed readings, workshops, hands-on training, grant
writing, and research activities. The training will take place primarily at Rice University’s Bioscience Research
Collaborative (BRC), an innovative space where scientists and educators from Rice University and its
neighbors in the Texas Medical Center (TMC) can come together to conduct collaborative research to improve
human health through science. This five-year plan for the proposed Mentor Career Development Award is
aimed at launching the candidate’s independent research career in identifying and targeting
biobehavioral mechanisms that inform intervention development, reduce disease burden, and promote
quality of life among the aging."

Behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD) is a common cause of young-onset
neurodegenerative disease and life expectancy is approximately 7 years, but this is highly variable. Recent
work associates change in cognitive and MRI imaging with pathologic phases of accumulating FTLD-TDP and
FTLD-Tau pathology. However, major gaps in knowledge concern the tremendous variability in the rate of
clinical progression in bvFTD, and the factors contributing to this variability. Studies have demonstrated that
lifestyle factors moderate the rate of clinical progression in neurodegenerative disease. This is attributed to
cognitive reserve, a form of resilience where cognitive strategies help support brain functioning in the face of
relentlessly accumulating pathology and thus modulate the rate of longitudinal decline. For example,
neuroanatomic factors may also play a role in neural implementation of compensatory function, such as
supporting alternate brain networks for optimal performance. Genetic factors associated with single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) also may impact the variable rate of decline in bvFTD by selectively increasing
anatomic network vulnerability to disease burden. The overall aim of this proposal is to better understand how
lifestyle and genetic factors impact neural networks to influence the rate of longitudinal decline. In Aim 1, we
will examine education, occupation and leisure activities that moderate the rate of longitudinal decline on
cognitive and functional measures. We will relate this to MRI of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) using
powerful graph theoretic analyses that examine key metrics of network connectivity and elucidate the
neuroanatomic basis of resilience. Aim 2 will use arterial spin labeling to enhance models of network
connectivity that predict the rate of longitudinal clinical decline, and expect to find key connectomic properties
of frontal networks related to cerebral blood flow that contribute to resilience in bvFTD. In Aim 3, we will
examine hypothesis-driven SNPs that may moderate the rate of clinical decline and relate SNP variation to
anatomic regions in connectomic networks. This unique combination of lifestyle, genetic and imaging factors
will lead to novel predictive models of clinical disease progression that are critical for clinical management and
clinical trial endpoints, while providing important prognostic data for patients and families.

10891642,"Abstract
In retroviruses, reverse transcription is initiated from an intermolecular duplex primer formed
by nucleocapsid-driven annealing of the U5-primer binding site (U5-PBS) region of the genome
with a host tRNA. However, the structure of this critical complex, and how reverse transcriptase
(RT) interacts with it is largely unknown. The structure of the HIV-1 complex presented in this
proposal shows that four tandem GNRA modules in U5-PBS spatially organizes the complex by
making continuous tetraloop-receptor docking interactions: one engages a rearranged tRNA, one
sequesters the initiation site, and two sequester the 18-bp primer to inhibit RT binding. Thus, in
contrast to the widely accepted model that a single RT molecule recognizes this complex to
initiate transcription, our data show that, in fact, two molecules of RT are required to bind in a
step-wise manner to release the repressed state and ensure accurate initiation: the first extensively
interacts with the U5 stem and acts as a remodeler, allowing for the subsequent one to bind the
canonical 18-bp primer and perform the enzymatic activity. Manipulation of the architecture, the
remodeling process, or competition with nucleocapsid, leads to severe loss of initiation accuracy.
Thus, this study redefines our basic understanding of HIV reverse transcription initiation; assigns
RT a structural remodeler role, separate from its enzymatic function; and indicates that the unique
mechanism may contribute to the control of start of DNA synthesis in virions. The aims will be:
(#1) to further detail the mechanism by mutational analysis, (#2) to understand the structural role
of NC and (#3) to determine the structures of the remodeler RT and enzymatic RT bound to the
U5-PBS:tRNAlys complex."

Type 1 diabetes and its metabolic consequences continue to be among the most significant biomedical
challenges in the US and worldwide today. In addition to morbidities specifically related to diabetes the disease
is associated with complications such as renal failure, lipid disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer and is
a major cause of death worldwide. Thus there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the pathogenesis
that promotes the loss of insulin-secreting beta cells to plan better therapeutics to combat the disease. Several
studies have argued that diverse cell types that make up the pancreatic niche contribute to the pathogenesis of
the disease process. Thus a better understanding of the inter-cellular communication between major cells such
as the acinar and duct cells and islet cells are warranted. We have studied the role of the mutant carboxy ester
lipase (CEL) gene, expressed in acinar cells, on its ability to be taken up by beta cells and cause defects in its
function and growth. The goal of this proposal is to discover the changes that occur when secretome from acinar
versus duct cells are incubated with human islet and β-cells. The data from these studies will generate new
hypothesis for testing that will allow a deeper interrogation of the cross-talk between human acinar, duct and
islet cells. We will address the following Aims in this proposal: Aim 1) Determine the ability of human acinar
versus human duct cells to directly impact islet cell function. We will isolate and characterize EVs, from human
induced pluripotent stem (hIPS) cell derived acinar- versus duct-lineage committed organoids, and incubate
them with human islet/β-cells and human pancreas slices to directly examine the consequences on islet cell
biology. We will also examine the EV cargo with a particular focus on fragments derived from transfer RNAs.
Aim 2) We will interrogate the ability of EVs, derived from acinar-derived organoids generated from the hiPS
cells from MODY8 patients, to directly regulate human islet-β-cell biology. The use of human organoids and
human pancreas slices will provide translational relevance of our studies. The results and datasets obtained
from these experiments will complement the efforts of the Human Islet Research Network and provide novel
resources to be shared with the larger scientific community."
10891651,"Centromeres are essential to genome inheritance. Abnormal centromere function is associated with birth defects,
infertility, and cancer. Human centromeric (CEN) chromatin typically forms on alpha satellite DNA, a 171bp
monomeric sequence that is organized into tandem arrays extending for several megabases. The Telomere-to-
Telomere (T2T) Consortium that recently produced the first complete human genome assembly revealed that
nearly all endogenous human chromosomes contain multiple alpha satellite arrays. We have shown that on some
chromosomes, multiple arrays are competent for centromere assembly. Using Homo sapiens chromosome 17
(HSA17) as a model, we demonstrated that centromere location is dictated by genomic variation within alpha
satellite DNA. On HSA17 that has three distinct higher order repeat (HOR) unit arrays, when the largest array
contains size and sequence variation, centromere assembly shifts to a nearby array. If the centromere forms at a
highly variant array, fewer centromere proteins are present and the chromosome experiences instability. We
hypothesize that placement/organization of variant HORs within an alpha satellite array influences centromere
location and kinetochore assembly. Since most human chromosomes must choose between two (or more) sites
at which to build a stable centromere, our work addresses a fundamental gap in the knowledge of basic processes
that influence centromere location, competence, and long-term stability. However, we still lack a comprehensive
view of the extent of alpha satellite variation within the population and thus the range of functional centromere
outcomes. In this competing renewal application, the proposed work builds on our classification of specific alpha
satellite variants identified in diverse human populations to assemble stable, de novo centromeres. We will also
systematically test centromere competency of long-range alpha satellite organization, coupled with variant
content and proximity to mobile elements. Our project goals are to: 1) produce new genomic assemblies of
functionally characterized centromeres using targeted long read sequencing approaches, 2) use human artificial
chromosome assays to assess competency of different alpha satellite DNA arrangements for de novo centromere
formation, 3) explore the molecular basis for variant centromere defects, and 4) use genome engineering to
rehabilitate and/or rescue defective variant centromeres. Successful completion of this work will result in major
advancement of our basic understanding of genomic variation within large repetitive DNA arrays in humans and
its link to specific centromere outcomes and long-term chromosome maintenance and stability."
10899137,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a neurological condition characterized by damage to the small blood
vessels in the brain. It is estimated that 20% to 30% of adults aged 65 and older may have some form of
CSVD, and this prevalence increases with advancing age. In CSVD, vascular impairment can contribute to the
accumulation of amyloid-beta protein, a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by hindering its
clearance from the brain and promoting the formation of amyloid plaques. Moreover, CSVD can exacerbate
cognitive decline in individuals with Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID). The
combination of vascular and degenerative processes in VCID can lead to more severe cognitive impairment
than expected with either condition alone. Early detection of CSVD is crucial for preventing VCID and AD in
older adults. The examination of underlying mechanisms of CSVD using early onset “pure” hereditary models
for vascular dementia (e.g., due to Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and
Leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL]) and AD (e.g., due to autosomal dominant mutations, ADAD) is a promising
strategy for identifying diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the more common sporadic forms of these
diseases. In VCID and AD, pathology is already present in the brain for many years before the emergence of
cognitive symptoms, suggesting that treatments may have the best chance of success in the preclinical stage.
An important consideration is that sex differences occur in VCID and AD. Females are disproportionately
affected by AD, comprising two-thirds of diagnosed individuals, whereas the prevalence of vascular dementia
is about 44% higher in males than females. The mechanisms underlying these sex-specific differences remain
unclear. Identifying sex-specific patterns of neurodegeneration in the early stages of cognitive impairment and
dementia will enable tailored interventions, sex-specific preventative strategies, and improved diagnostic
accuracy for both males and females. The overall aim of this project is to examine sex differences in VCID and
AD by measuring white matter integrity, functional brain connectivity, and cognitive function in individuals
genetically determined to develop early-onset VCID (CADASIL) or AD (ADAD, Presenilin-1 E280A). My
overarching hypothesis is that white matter integrity and patterns of functional connectivity can be used as
predictors of cognitive impairment and dementia in CADASIL and ADAD. Further, I expect that white matter
integrity and functional connectivity can serve as biomarkers that predict distinct outcomes for males and
females, not only in VCID but also in ADAD, the latter of which has more traditionally been characterized by
measures of tau and amyloid pathology. Through this project, I will (1) gain expertise in neuroimaging analysis
related to white matter disease in VCID and ADAD, (2) receive training on sex differences in dementia and
sex-specific risk factors contributing to disease outcomes, and (3) establish professional relationships with
research collaborators to strengthen the basis of a future career as a clinical neuroscientist."
10899140,"Investigating the role of autophagy inducers and peroxisomal proteins in pexophagy
Peroxisomes are critical organelles that house fatty acid ꞵ-oxidation and antioxidative enzymes
that detoxify reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Peroxins maintain peroxisomal proteostasis
by coordinating biogenesis, matrix protein import, and receptor recycling. Impairment of
peroxisome biogenesis can impact many physiological processes in plants and humans. Despite
the importance of peroxisomes, peroxisomal turnover, a key aspect of proteostasis, remains
poorly understood. The primary mechanism for organelle turnover is autophagy, and the selective
autophagy of peroxisomes is termed pexophagy. In this process, damaged or excess
peroxisomes are sequestered via encirclement of an isolation membrane to form
autophagosomes, which then fuse with a degradative organelle (the vacuole in plants and yeast).
In the vacuole, the peroxisome, now in the autophagic body, is lysed by vacuolar proteases and
lipases, and the nutrients from this degradation are exported to the cytosol for reuse by the cell.
Stress-inducing conditions, such as nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, etc. can induce general
autophagy; however, plant-specific pexophagy proteins and conditions remain to be identified. To
better understand plant pexophagy and the proteins involved, I plan to monitor autophagy and
pexophagy via western analysis of reporters that separately mark peroxisomal and
autophagosomal membranes and are cleaved upon delivery of autophagosomes to the vacuole.
I will also use the fluorescence of these reporters to visualize pexophagy using confocal
microscopy. Using the tools that I develop, I will elucidate the role various peroxisomal proteins
in pexophagy, including NBR1 (a selective autophagy receptor), peroxisomal proteins containing
ATG8-interacting motifs, LON2 (a peroxisomal chaperone and protease), and peroxisome-
associated ubiquitination enzymes. Beyond improving basic understanding of fundamental cell
biology, furthering our understanding of peroxisome regulation can improve our understanding of
metabolic illnesses in humans and provide targets for metabolic engineering in crops."
10899143,"Project Summary:
Cytoskeletal abnormalities are prominent features in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases and have
been attributed to induce neuronal death. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias such as
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD), microtubule-associated protein tau
(tau) is hyperphosphorylated and aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which contributes to
mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted autophagy, and neuronal death. Despite the critical role of tau abnormalities
in neurodegenerative diseases like AD and ALS-FTD, how this dysregulation arises is not fully understood. Our
group has found a signaling pathway that when disrupted, leads to changes in tau post-translational
modifications that are associated with disease. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2 or GDPD5)
is the only known protein in vertebrates that acts at the cell surface in neurons to cleave the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor that tethers a subclass of proteins to the membrane. GDE2 has been
shown to aberrantly accumulate intracellularly in neurons of patients with AD and ALS. Consistent with GDE2
dysfunction in disease, biochemical studies in postmortem AD brain confirm impaired GPI-anchored protein
processing, while proteomic studies of patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect a decrease in neuronally
expressed GPI-anchored proteins in the CSF of ALS patients. GDE2 deletion in the APP/PS1 mouse model of
amyloidosis leads to an increase in tau phosphorylation, and preliminary studies in primary cultured neurons
from the PS19 humanized tauopathy mouse model show that loss of GDE2 results in increased tau levels and
phosphorylation. These observations suggest that GDE2 is required for regulating the dynamics of tau
phosphorylation. The overarching hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that GDE2 is an important
regulator of tau post-translational modifications and that GDE2 inactivation contributes to tau
abnormalities in disease. In Aim 1, I will utilize the PS19 model to examine how the loss of GDE2 affects the
onset and progression of neurodegeneration in the context of tau modifications and aggregation in vivo and in
vitro. In Aim 2, I will explore the pathway through which GDE2 modulates tau post-translational modifications
through structure-function analysis of GDE2 and by taking a candidate-based approach that focuses on select
GPI-anchored substrates associated with AD and ADRDs. In Aim 3, I will determine the relevance of GDE2 to
tau pathology in AD postmortem brain. Together, the outcomes of my project will provide insight into pathways
relevant to tau pathology observed in AD and ADRDs and could provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

Significance: Approximately 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB) in 2021. However, only 6.4 million
of these individuals were diagnosed and linked to care. A quarter of the 4.2 million undiagnosed TB cases were
in India. To help find the missing millions, the World Health Organization recommends investigating household
contacts of individuals with active TB. This intervention is usually implemented after index patient diagnosis.
Considering India’s high TB recurrence rate of approximately 13%, the government has also introduced TB
screening among treatment-completed patients. However, evidence around the effectiveness of screening in the
post-treatment period is scarce and optimal strategies for implementation have not yet been identified.
Specific Aims: Post-treatment household contact investigation is being implemented in Maharashtra, India
under the TB Aftermath non-inferiority trial and includes screening of the index patient (n=1076) and their
household contacts. This proposal assesses the overall effectiveness of post-treatment household contact
investigation and will generate policy-relevant evidence for optimizing the intervention in India and other similar
high TB burden settings. We will (1) determine the effect of the intervention compared to control sites that
represent standard of care, (2) evaluate implementation of the intervention compared to the standard of care,
and (3) develop a model for predicting TB recurrence to help target the intervention among high-risk households.
Approach: We will conduct a segmented regression analysis of TB recurrences detected in the 36 months
before and 36 months after post-treatment household contact investigation was introduced under TB Aftermath.
We will use routine TB data and compare trends in TB Aftermath sites (n=6) to control sites (n=6) selected using
propensity score matching. We will evaluate implementation based on the RE-AIM framework and will use mixed
methods. For the qualitative component, we will leverage existing TB Aftermath data (n=100 in-depth interviews
with patients, contacts, and staff) and will conduct 20 additional interviews with staff at the control sites. We will
use a convergent design to merge qualitative and quantitative findings (descriptive statistics on implementation
outcomes). Lastly, we will build and validate a predictive model for recurrence using TB Aftermath data (n=1076
participants). We will leverage existing RePORT India cohort data for external validation. By combining rigorous
epidemiologic and implementation research methods and engaging with key stakeholders, our team is poised to
thoughtfully translate optimized post-treatment household contact investigation into policy and practice.
Fellowship Information: The proposed study will serve as the dissertation for Ms. Samyra Cox, an Infectious
Disease Epidemiology PhD candidate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose a
dedicated mentorship team with relevant expertise and an individualized training plan that includes skill-building
and professional development activities. This training is directly aligned with Ms. Cox’s career goal of becoming
a leader in translational epidemiology conducting rigorous, policy-relevant research for infectious disease control."

include i3M (CSIC ‐ Spanish National Research Council) and Bruker Española. The UVa team has expertise
in testing/validating novel PET scanners, MRI software (pulse programming) and hardware design, and
mouse PET and MRI scanning. I3M and their colleagues at Bruker have a wealth of expertise in designing
and building multimodal scanners, including the Albira trimodal PET/SPECT/CT mouse scanner. Much of
the technology needed for the ST‐PET scanner has been developed by i3M/Bruker and will be ported as
part of this project to the ST‐PET. The proposed work includes: (1) Fabricate a ST‐PET insert for a high field
MRI scanner. The insert will be implemented by i3M and Bruker. Test and validate the ST‐PET scanner
outside the magnet first at i3M and then at UVa. (2) Integrate and test the ST‐PET insert with the 7T
ClinScan MRI at UVa. (3) As a proof‐of‐principle project, use the newly developed ST‐PET/MRI to image
lung cancer progression and metastasis in a mouse model."

 Approximately 1 in 100 children born in the United State have a congenital heart defect (CHD). Nearly a
quarter of these children present with “critical” CHDs, requiring surgical intervention within the first year of life.
For patients in which a CHD is the source of pulmonary hypertension (e.g., the unrestricted flow of blood to the
lungs), a palliative pulmonary artery band (PAB) can be applied to regulate blood flow. Conventional PABs are
fixed and thus commit children to repeated surgeries if adjustments are needed due to altered hemodynamics
and/or to accommodate growth. As a result, the affected children suffer from high morbidity and mortality. This
proposal addresses this clinical need by developing and optimizing novel stimuli-responsive materials for
integration with PABs to permit adjustability.
 Light is an ideal stimulus to introduce minimally invasive reconfigurability to the PAB. The objective of
this research activity is to integrate photoresponsive materials with PABs to enable the diameter of the PAB to
be reconfigured via light delivered by an endovascular fiber-optic catheter through the artery wall. Aim 1 is
focused on material development and integration into novel PAB designs that leverage the stimuli-responsive
material. Aim 2 will assess the cellular and host responses to the stimuli-responsive material and develop
strategies to engineer these responses if necessary. Long-term, the evolution of stimuli-responsive materials will
lead to a wide variety of growth-accommodating and shape-changing medical devices that will improve patient
outcomes and quality of life.
 This collaborative research project will be undertaken at the University of Colorado Boulder with
mentorship and support from Dr. Timothy White and Dr. Kristi Anseth. The training plan includes development
of technical skills (e.g. polymer chemistry, medical device design, and biological testing of biomaterials) and
professional skills (e.g. communication skills, career development, and scientific outreach). In sum, this
application will provide the applicant with invaluable training for his future career as a surgeon-scientist focused
on translating novel biomaterials into impactful medical devices and technologies."

understood, though such mechanisms have ramifications across nearly all of medicine, e.g., disease detection,
response to stress, treatment, and more. Intracellular small molecule metabolite, lipid and therapeutic
concentrations are often inferred through protein expression or directly measured as the average of 1000’s of
cells at once, providing only a population-level view of heterogeneous metabolic response. This obfuscates
differentiation of anomalous metabolic cell phenotypes and small molecule associations occurring within cells.
Currently there exists a gap in analytical technologies for the measure of small molecules (<1000 Dalton) in
single mammalian cells. Most technologies lack the sensitivity, broad chemical coverage, quantitative capability,
and/or the sampling throughput needed to enable the mechanisms of heterogeneous metabolic response of cells
to be explored, but recently the development of single cell printing-liquid vortex capture-mass spectrometry
(SCP-LVC-MS) has overcome many of these limitations. We hypothesize that this technology could resolve the
current analytical gap in the quantitative measure of small molecules from single cells.
 The goal of this research is to address key technical challenges regarding validation of the quantitative
accuracy of SCP-LVC-MS (Aim #1), representativeness of SCP-LVC-MS measured cellular chemical profiles
(Aim #2), and ability to relate SCP-LVC-MS measurements to established single-cell technologies (Aim #3) so
that SCP-LVC-MS can become an effective research tool in the biomedical community and enable associations
between metabolites and therapeutics to be investigated on an individual cellular basis for the first time. These
technical challenges are addressed by measure of localized intracellular compounds and comparison with in-
capillary fluorescence measurements, by validating the representativeness of SCP-LVC-MS measured chemical
profiles through comparison of spectra acquired before and after single cell isolation and by incorporating
fluorescence microscopy into the SCP-LVC-MS optical detection and cell isolation system.
 These aims work together to validate and improve the capabilities of SCP-LVC-MS to answer questions
regarding the central challenge of understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning heterogeneous
metabolic response, by filling in the technological gap that exists in this area for quantitative, high throughput
analysis of metabolites, lipids and drugs in single cells. The completion of this research will enable fundamental
biomedical questions to be pursued that could not be before, such as how intracellular metabolite concentrations
relate to each other or how expression of a protein quantitatively impacts therapeutic response in the same cell.
Fundamental questions like these have impacts in how we understand disease, how single-cell chemistry links
across biological scales (e.g., organ level phenotypes), and many other fundamental aspects of medicine."

Defensins are small, innate immune peptides with broad antimicrobial activity, yet some pathogens, including
non-enveloped viruses, have evolved methods to evade or co-opt defensins to enhance their infectivity.
Resistance or enhancement is most pronounced for enteric viruses, leading to the hypothesis that fecal/oral
transmission facilitates viral evolution to escape defensin neutralization. The studies herein will determine the
molecular, cellular, and evolutionary mechanisms of viral escape from defensin action. Using a library of
chimeric defensin peptides, we will determine the structural and biochemical properties of defensins essential
to their activity against human adenovirus, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus (Aim1). Testing defensins
against representatives from multiple viral families will provide insight into which defensin structural elements
are globally required for activity, versus which are pathogen-specific. To more clearly elucidate the drivers of
viral resistance to defensins, we will leverage the biological diversity across enteroviruses (EVs) to study how
defensin sensitivity is related to viral transmission (Aim 2). In parallel, we will determine the cellular mechanism
of EV neutralization by defensins, as well as the mechanism of EV defensin escape (Aim 3). This work will
provide insight into how viral pathogens bypass the host innate immune system to promote infectivity,
expanding our understanding of the host/pathogen evolutionary arms race. Many of the viruses included in
these studies cause serious human illnesses, and this work will also point to new routes for antiviral
development.
The proposed work is designed to provide training in several techniques of virology and cellular biology,
including cell culture and viral assays; high-performance liquid chromatography and peptide purification;
biophysical binding assays; cellular mechanism studies; as well as microscopy. In addition to scientific
expertise, the proposed training plan also includes education in scientific communication; mentorship;
responsible research conduct; diversity, equity, and inclusion; as well as a career development plan for
becoming a successful independent researcher. This work will be conducted in the University of Washington
Microbiology Department, which is a hub for infectious disease research. This richly collaborative environment
includes several faculty members and core facilities that provide the necessary resources, equipment, and
expertise to enable completion of the proposed training plan."

The Global Alliance for Preventing Pandemics has a long and productive history collaborating
with scientists, clinicians, and academics from Mali, Liberia, and many other countries in the
Global South. Recently, we have codified a workforce development program to train people to
use best technical practices developed by the group at Columbia University to more efficiently,
quickly, and economically identify and contain pathogen outbreaks. In this proposal we set forth
the plans to move the successful New York-based training to Bamako at USTTB so the Mali
professionals may replicate the training experience for their neighbors in West Africa. Further, we
have identified the need for training in the broad field of Scientific Writing which includes
presenting data to inform governmental decision-makers with posters, reports, data papers, and
funding proposals. Our goal is to build capacity in Mali and neighboring countries such as Liberia
to increase the written communication skills of public health scientists at all levels. And lastly, we
propose to create a Master of Science in molecular biology at USTTB to help build a cohort of
well-trained and local technical staff dedicated to fighting infectious disease in the region. We
believe this multi-tier approach of integrated workforce development, professional development,
and traditional academic programs will help retain talent and ensure the next generation of senior
technical leadership will be better prepared for unexpected outbreaks across the region. And
lastly, we believe that after demonstrating success in Mali, we will be able to replicate the
approach in other regions in need of short, medium, and long-term education and workforce
development and retention strategies so they may achieve medical and healthcare independence
as outlined in the International Health Regulations of 2005."
10892705,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nell-1 has been studied extensively for its osteogenic role in craniofacial skeletal development. However, despite
its high expression in the brain, there has been a lack of understanding of Nell-1's function in the nervous system
until the recent identification of a ligand-receptor like interaction between Nell-1 and Cntnap4. Cntnap4 is a pre-
synaptic membrane protein whereby global Cntnap4 loss differentially inhibits GABAergic output and augments
dopaminergic transmission, and can induce autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors in mice. Remarkably,
ENU-induced Nell-1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit ASD-like behaviors similar to those seen in Cntnap4 mutant
mice. Meanwhile, inactivation of either Cntnap4 or Nell-1 in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) gives rise to
remarkably similar calvarial bone defects. Moreover, novel co-localization studies of Nell-1 and Cntnap4 in
mouse and human brains revealed broad neural tissue distribution and high levels of co-localized expression.
Consequently, this proposal hypothesizes that Nell-1 has dual roles in the brain and craniofacial bones (CB) via
a novel interaction between Nell-1 and Cntnap4, and that disruption of the Nell-1/Cntnap4 functional axis will not
only induce deficits in CB, but also interfere with neural transmission in the brain. This proposal advances three
specific aims to investigate the Nell-1/Cntnap4 functional axis in the CB and brain using two new floxed mouse
lines, Nell-1fl/fl and Cntnap4fl/fl. AIM 1 will first define the tissue distribution and expression of Nell-1 and Cntnap4
in both the CB and brain during normal development and growth in wild type (WT) mice. AIM 1 will then specify
the functional contributions of Nell-1 and Cntnap4 to the CB and brain using tissue-specific knockout (KO) Nell-
1Wnt1KO and Cntnap4Wnt1KO mice targeting CNCCs-derived CB and trigeminal ganglions (TG) by Wnt1-Cre, and
Nell-1PV-2AKO and Cntnap4PV-2AKO mice targeting parvalbumin positive (PV+) GABAergic neurons in the brain
and TG by PV-2A-Cre. The CB growth and behavioral changes in these KO mice will be correlated with
morphological changes in the examined bones, brain, and the craniofacial neuroskeletal interface where TG
sensory fibers innervate the CB. AIM 2 will decipher Nell-1's osteogenic property in the context of Cntnap4 during
the repair and regeneration of CB defects in Cntnap4Wnt1KO mice using Nell-1 protein. With Nell-1 serving as an
agonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, AIM 2 will determine how integrin β1, a Nell-1 binding partner, and glycogen
synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a crucial regulator of β-catenin phosphorylation, modulate Nell-1/Cntnap4
interaction-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation during CNCC osteogenesis. AIM 3 will investigate Nell-
1/Cntnap4 interaction on brain GABAergic transmission and ASD-like behaviors in Nell-1PV-2AKO and Cntnap4PV-
2AKO mice. AIM 3 will further assess Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the context of Nell-1/Cntnap4 interaction-
mediated GABA release, along with the possible additive or synergistic effects of GSK3β inhibitors with Nell-1 in
mouse neuronal cells. IMPACT: The ultimate goal is to reveal how the newly identified Nell-1/Cntnap4 interaction
may translate into developing Nell-1 as a novel therapeutic to treat human skeletal and neurological pathologies."
10890339,"Evidence supporting the epigenetic inheritance of diseases in mammals is accumulating, and the endogenous
retrovirus (ERV) may play as a heritable epigenetic vehicle. HML-2, the ERV species most recently integrated
into the human genome, is epigenetically silenced in normal cells, but our lab and others recently revealed that
HML-2 is transiently activated in human primordial germ cells (PGCs) but silenced as PGCs differentiate to
sex-specific germ cells. In contrast, HML-2 is often activated in common cancers (e.g., breast cancer, prostate
cancer, or melanomas), and two HML-2 viral proteins are presumed oncogenic, supporting a growing paradigm
that HML-2 reactivation may contribute to human carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that the epigenetic silencing
of HML-2 during the post-PGC development of human germ cells may be impaired by environmental toxicants.
The affected, incompletely silenced HML-2 loci may be vulnerable to reactivation, increasing the cancer risk in
the next generation. Our mechanistic reasoning of this hypothesis is that assembly of protein complexes
required for formation of heterochromatin – the main epigenetic machinery silencing ERVs – is known to be
disrupted by transcriptional activation in its vicinity. Therefore, transactivation and/or DNA demethylation by
toxic chemicals may impair epigenetic silencing of HML-2. HML-2 is strongly activated in pluripotent stem cell
(PSC)-derived PGC-Like Cells (PGCLCs). In the xenogeneic reconstituted testis (xrTestis) organoid culture
involving human PGCLCs and mouse embryonic testicular somatic cells, PGCLCs differentiate to gonocyte-
like cells (GnCLCs), in which all HML-2 loci are efficiently silenced. Our Specific Aim 1 will expose xrTestes to
toxicants (PFOA, dieldrin and benzo[a]pyrene), and the transcriptional and epigenetic states of all HML-2 loci
in GnCLCs will be examined by bulk and single-cell deep sequencing. Degrees of relaxation in epigenetic
silencing will be evaluated under pharmacologically induced, modest HML-2 reactivation using inhibitors of
DNA methyltransferase 1 or H3K9 methyltransferases. Also using deep sequencing, Specific Aim 2 will
determine whether impaired epigenetic silencing of HML-2 is repaired during the global epigenetic
reprogramming in human PSCs and PGCLCs. Epigenetic silencing of selected HML-2 loci will be specifically
relaxed by CRISPRa. Specific Aim 3 will create a humanized mouse model harboring the HML-2 locus
associating the PRODH gene in the mouse genome safe-harbor locus Rosa26 and examine its epigenetic
states and activation in mouse PGCs, gonocytes, and somatic cells muti-generationally after CRISPRa
activation of the HML-2 locus or gestational exposures to toxicants. Specific Aim4 will perform computational
analysis of RNA-seq data retrieved from databases to identify similarities and differences in the HML-2 loci
activated in various human cancers and PGCLCs. The outcome of this project may create a novel paradigm
focusing on the toxicological importance of HML-1 as a heritable epigenetic vehicle, linking exposure of
pregnant women to toxicants and cancer risk in the subsequent generation."
10897920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal seeks to understand how proteins located in the cell membrane work as gatekeepers to
selectively allow compounds into or out of the cell. Such gatekeepers are known as or ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, because they use the energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) hydrolysis
to transport compounds across the cell membrane. Bacterial ABC importers are essential for
organism survival, controlling the rate of uptake for nutrients scavenged from the bacterium's
environment. Control of the rate of transport precludes over-accumulation of a nutrient that is
beneficial at low concentrations, but is potentially toxic at high concentrations. While a subset of ABC
proteins contain an additional “accessory” domain that can regulate the uptake of compounds by
shutting off the transporter, it is unclear why certain transporters contain these domains while others
do not. However, we do understand that certain transporters are “turned off” when a specific
compound or protein binds to this accessory domain. Other accessory domains regulate by “sensing”
changes in the microenvironment and reacting accordingly. To decipher this mechanism of regulation,
the PI's laboratory combines biochemical and biophysical experiments with structural biology to
understand how these accessory domains play a role in transport regulation, which in restricts or
allows nutrients to enter the cell. This research program will define the molecular mechanism that
controls nutrient uptake and allow researchers to understand how multiple transport systems work in
concert within an organism to maintain cell survival. We will test our hypothesis that regulation of
transporter activation via a sensing accessory protein. The proposed research will decipher the
complex circuitry of regulation in a model system in three Aims to: (1) understand how PepT SBPs
select for different substrates within the microenvironment (i.e., nutrients, cofactors and peptides); (2)
determine how the assembly of the core transporter dictates transport selectivity and efficiency (3)
reveal how PepT transporters regulate the import of substrates into the cell through the activation of a
novel regulatory domain. This research program has set out to close critical gaps in the understanding
of the fundamentals of the transport mechanism present in all bacteria. The results will yield insights
into how regulatory domains modulate transport across all organisms, crucial for cell viability."

Our laboratory is interested in understanding how eukaryotic cells ensure the maintenance of telomeres, the
natural ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Evolutionarily conserved shelterin and CST (CTC1/Cdc13-
STN1-TEN1) complexes play essential roles in telomerase recruitment and protection of telomeres against DNA
repair and checkpoint factors. Stable maintenance of telomeres is critical to preserve genomic integrity and
prevent accumulation of undesired mutations that might lead to tumor formation. Regulation of telomere
structures and telomerase also affect cell proliferation and tissue maintenance in aging organisms. Therefore,
basic mechanistic studies investigating how telomere and DNA damage response proteins collaborate in proper
telomere maintenance should provide critical insights necessary to help devise more effective treatment
strategies against tumors or other age-related diseases. Our proposed research projects utilize fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast telomeres serve as a good model for human telomeres, since
proteins involved in telomere maintenance are highly conserved between fission yeast and humans.
Studies from our lab and others have provided detailed insights how fission yeast shelterin and Stn1-Ten1
ensure stable maintenance of telomeres in fission yeast. Those include findings that (1) Tel1ATM/Rad3ATR_
dependent phosphorylation of the shelterin subunit Ccq1 on Thr93 promotes telomerase recruitment by
promoting interaction between Ccq1 and the telomerase subunit Est1, and (2) SUMOylation of another shelterin
subunit Tpz1ree, on Lys242 facilitates Stn1-Ten1 recruitment to telomeres and limits telomere extension.
Evolutionarily conserved ""TEL patch"" residues within Tpz1 have also been found to promote telomerase
activation and recruitment, further highlighting the well conserved nature of telomere regulation by fission yeast
and mammalian shelterin. Our analyses of temporal binding patterns for DNA polymerases, telomerase, shelterin
and Stn1 found that shelterin subunits Rap1 and Poz1 and the Stn1-Ten1 complex promote timely dissociation
of telomerase from telomeres by promoting recruitment of Pola to complete lagging strand synthesis at
telomeres. For the current grant application, our proposed experiments will (1) identify and characterize
underlying regulatory mechanism(s) that allow Ccq1 and Poz1 to promote Pola-dependent telomere protection
(Aim 1), (2) identify new interaction partners of Stn1-Ten1 complex and characterize their contributions to
recruitment/retention of Stn1-Ten1 complex at telomeres and non-telomeric sites (Aim 2), and (3) investigate
how regulation of TERRA vs. poly(A)+ TERRA expression modulates Stn1-Ten1-Pola recruitment at telomeres
(Aim 3)."

Alcoholic associated liver disease (ALD) is a consequence of chronic alcohol consumption that leads to
hepatocellular injury and liver inflammation. Alcohol abuse increases the translocation of gut-derived endotoxins
(lipopolysaccharide; LPS) to the portal circulation and causes Kupffer cells activation, the resident macrophages
in the liver, through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, leading to nuclear regulatory factor kappa B (NF-κB)
activation, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) . SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification that involves addition of SUMOs
(small ubiquitin-like modifiers) modulating protein stability, activity and localization. Several studies have
intimated a close relationship between SUMOylation and ROS. We recently demonstrated that ubiquitin
Conjugating Enzyme 9 (UBC9), the sole E2 protein required by the SUMOylation machinery, is upregulated in
murine NIAAA and Intragastric models. We also found that UBC9 is phosphorylated and this is correlated with
high level of SUMOylation activity in LPS-activated KCs that leads to inflammation. In addition, we elucidated
the key function of SUMOylated microsomal Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in ALD that sustains its enzymatic
activity and protein stability. However, several important mechanistic pathways that are altered in ALD have not
been investigated yet. By phospho-peptide mapping of LPS-activated KCs and NIAAA KCs, we found that UBC9
was phosphorylated at two serine residues (S2 and S7) and one tyrosine residue (Y68). Interestingly, the S2
and S7 UBC9 phospho-events were found in both normal and activated KCs whereas Y68 phosphorylation was
induced specifically in activated cells. In order to examine whether UBC9 phosphorylation has pro-inflammatory
effects in KCs in ALD, Mass Spectrometry (MS) was performed to identify UBC9 interacting proteins in isolated-
NIAAA KCs. Crosslinking proteomics revealed interaction of UBC9 with several inflammatory pathways.
Furthermore, phospho-UBC9 was found to interact favorably with components of NF-κB signaling. CRISPR-
directed gene editing of the Y68 and S2 residues (but not S7) of UBC9 lowered inflammatory cytokines in
activated KCs. These data provide the rationale to examine how phospho-UBC9 regulates components of
inflammatory signaling. This proposal tests the novel hypothesis that ethanol induces KCs activation in
ALD by modulating UBC9’s biological activity and this may impact key inflammatory response signaling
pathways. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Examine how phosphorylation of UBC9 influences its
biological function upon alcohol exposure, 2) Investigate the effect of UBC9 Y68 phosphorylation on the
crosstalk between KCs and hepatocytes in ALD, 3) Examine the effects of UBC9 Y68 gene editing on c-
SRC interaction in ALD. If successfully completed, these studies should provide highly novel information on
the role of phosphor UBC9 in the development of ALD and may provide novel therapeutic strategies, which is of

as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC).
One DCC and 10 Clinical Centers (RFA-DK-19-022) will form the clinical consortium, T1DAPC. An efficient and
supportive DCC not only collaborates on development of all documentation and provides efficient statistical
analyses and Trial Master File, the results from the DCC form the backbone of numerous publications,
preliminary data for subsequent trials, and may lead to profound novel insights from ad-hoc, post-hoc, and
newly formulated analyses to Questions arising during the study. DPHS has vast experience and expertise as
the DCC for 10 NIH-funded clinical trial and five observational study research networks, which resulted in more
than 200 publications, six subsequent grants. Our vast experience in DCC for HIPAA-compliant data
compilation and analyses of multicenter clinical trials spans more than a dozen therapeutic areas and can
provide additional insights for analysis of ethnically and geographically diverse population of subjects as well
as development and analyses of distinct and overlapping clinical profiles, some being instituted post hoc with
development and testing cohorts. The DCC will aggregate and analyze all common data elements and
samples and provide scientific infrastructure and administrative support in a clear, concise, friendly manner for
the T1DAPC Consortium. The DCC and the Clinical Centers will form multi-disciplinary teams that execute a
prospective longitudinal observational study that can determine the incidence of T1 diabetes associated with
an acute pancreatitis episode and assess relationships with potential early biomarkers, clinical signs,
biomarkers of disease progression, immune and genetic risk factors, most susceptible subgroups, precipitating
mechanisms, etiology of acute pancreatitis, and associated pathophysiology of the T1D or other types of
diabetes. The DCC will collect, synthesize, and disseminate main findings and lessons learned from the
T1DAPC parent and ancillary studies, create public data sets, and share the biological samples in accordance

 The RAS/MAP kinase pathway is aberrantly activated in a wide variety of human cancers. The V600E
mutation in BRAF, a kinase in this pathway, causes approximately one-half of all melanomas and is the driver in
many other cancers as well. Despite decades of intense interest and investigation, BRAF regulation is not well-
understood. Furthermore, compounds targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway exhibit poorly understood
pharmacologic effects. BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, potently inhibit V600E BRAF, but they
paradoxically activate wild type BRAF. Inhibitors of MEK, a kinase downstream of BRAF, differ in their efficacy
depending upon whether the pathway is activated by mutations in KRAS versus BRAF. Collectively, the
confusing pharmacology of these agents reflects our incomplete knowledge of the regulation and biochemical
workings of this pathway and limits our ability to develop targeted therapies for BRAF and the RAS/MAPK
pathway.
 Over the last two decades, my laboratory has focused on the structural biology of protein kinases and
their dysregulation in cancer, and on cancer drug discovery. We have applied our basic biophysical, biochemical
and structural insights into wild-type and mutant EGFR to discover new classes of pharmacologic agents
targeting the mutant receptor, including both mutant-selective covalent and allosteric inhibitors that can
overcome resistance mechanisms. We are now applying an analogous structural and mechanistic approach to
demystify BRAF regulation and pharmacology. Our objectives are to understand BRAF regulation in structural
detail, to decipher the complex pharmacology of the BRAF and MEK inhibitors, and to develop new agents that
target the pathway in a mutant-selective manner. To achieve these goals, we will determine the structure of
autoinhibited and active BRAF complexes using cryo-electron microscopy. We will reconstitute the pathway from
KRAS to ERK using purified components in order to dissect mechanisms of BRAF and MEK activation and probe
the effects of pharmacologic agents that target the pathway. In addition, we will use these reconstitutions together
with our structural insights to discover new agents that target the pathway in a mutant-selective manner. These
studies will provide fundamental new understanding of BRAF regulation and, in the long term, they should yield
more effective and better tolerated therapies for cancers driven by mutagenic activation of this pathway."

The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will launch Dr. Amy Stamates’ program
of research as an independent scientist focusing on the etiology of alcohol problems among young adults. This
goal will be achieved through a 5-year parallel research and tailored training plan. Training goals include
building expertise in (1) clinical knowledge of alcohol use; (2) executive functioning (EF) and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); (3) ecological momentary assessment (EMA); (4) advanced longitudinal
data analyses; and (5) grantsmanship. Training goals will be met through a comprehensive training plan
involving meetings with Drs. Lynda Stein (expert in alcohol interventions), Lisa Weyandt (expert in ADHD),
Kristina Jackson (expert in EMA methods and analyses), and Timothy Wilens (expert in ADHD and substance
use disorders); workshops; conferences; coursework; and experiential activities. Skills gained through the
training plan will be put into action through a complementary research plan aimed to understand the alcohol-
risk process of young adult drinkers with ADHD. Young adults with ADHD are at greater risk for experiencing
alcohol problems (e.g., risky sex, driving after drinking) and developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared
to those without ADHD. However, it is unclear why those with ADHD are at greater risk because research
supports that they drink less than or equivalent to their non-ADHD peers. The proposed project will study this
discrepancy by utilizing a measurement-burst design pairing laboratory and EMA to examine controlled (EF)
and automatic (craving) processes in relation to alcohol use among those with and without ADHD. Participants
(stratified by ADHD and gender) will be 141 young adult drinkers who complete three bursts over a one-year
period (baseline, 6-months, and 12-months). Each timepoint will include a laboratory session assessing EF
followed by 17 days of EMA assessing craving, alcohol use, alcohol problems, context, and social setting. The
proposed project has three specific aims: (1) examine the impact of ADHD on EF and alcohol outcomes
(craving, alcohol use, and alcohol problems) at baseline; (2) determine within-person changes between EF and
alcohol outcomes over one year for those with and without ADHD; (3) identify event-level predictors (context,
social setting) that heighten craving, alcohol use, and alcohol problems for those with ADHD. Findings from the
proposal will provide preliminary data for a R01 application to be completed by Dr. Stamates during the award
period. The proposed research seeks to address knowledge gaps of etiological factors underlying ADHD and
AUD, with the ultimate goal to identify opportunities to tailor prevention and intervention approaches for young
adults with ADHD. Thus, this proposal is in line with NIAAA’s 2017-2021 Strategic Plan for Research to
investigate mechanisms underlying comorbid alcohol and psychiatric disorders. Completion of the K01 will
provide Dr. Stamates with the expertise to conduct innovative, high-impact research focusing on the etiology of
alcohol-related problems, particularly young adults with ADHD who may be most vulnerable."
10897950,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease — 1.5 million
deaths and 10 million new active TB cases each year. A major reason the situation is not improving is that TB
treatment is lengthy and challenging, requiring 6 months or more of multiple antibiotics with serious side
effects. This regimen causes widespread non-compliance leading to relapse and promoting the evolution of
multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
 Mtb is remarkably successful, in part, due to its ability to become dormant in response to host immune
pressures. Mtb has a two-component regulatory system (TCS), DosRST, that when induced by hypoxia, nitric
oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO) remodels Mtb physiology to promote non-replicating persistence (NRP).
NRP bacteria are thought to drive the long course of TB treatment. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibitors of
DosRST-dependent adaptation will reduce survival of drug-tolerant NRP Mtb and could function to shorten the
course of therapy. By an innovative, reporter-based whole-cell phenotypic screen of a >540,000 compound
library, we have discovered four new inhibitors that inhibit DosRST signaling by directly targeting the DosS and
DosT sensor kinases. These first-in-class chemical probes, HC101, HC102, HC103 and HC106, represent a
new strategy to inhibit Mtb persistence. Under hypoxia, all four compounds inhibit Mtb NRP-associated
physiologies, including triacylglycerol synthesis and survival. Mechanism of action studies show they directly
inhibit DosS and DosT kinases, but by distinct mechanisms; HC101 and HC106 directly target a heme group
embedded in the kinases, while HC102 and HC103 inhibit sensor kinase autophosphorylation.
 A critical barrier to studying TCS is the lack of chemical probes that function against bacteria in whole cells.
The goal of this proposal is to use these chemical probes as new tools to dissect the biochemical mechanisms
of DosS/T sensor kinase function and the impact of conditional sensor kinase inhibition on Mtb physiology. Aim
1 will use biochemical and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to define mechanisms of action of the
probes. In Aim 2, genetic approaches will be used to identify amino acid residues associated with resistance to
the compounds and required for kinase function. Aim 3 will use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), combined
with treatment with the chemical probes, to define the biological impact of conditional DosRST inhibition both in
vitro and during infection. This R01 will define new mechanisms for TCS function and generate proof-of-
concept data validating DosRST as a target for the development of new TB drugs.
 OVERALL IMPACT: These studies will surmount obstacles that have long stymied TB therapy by focusing
small molecule development on new targets and bringing critically needed understanding of TCS function in
vitro and during infection."

A global obesity epidemic is driving the concomitant rapid increase in the prevalence of cardiometabolic
disorders (CMDs), including hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). Population- and sex-specific differences in CMD predisposition exist; however, the
biological mechanisms underlying these differences are not well understood. Previous large-scale genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have reliably identified CMD-associated variants in multiple populations; however,
functional understanding of the biological mechanisms of the GWAS variants remains challenging. One major
obstacle is the limited knowledge of the relevant cell types in which GWAS variants affect gene expression. Bulk
tissue gene expression data exist for CMD-relevant tissues, such as subcutaneous adipose, but these data
exhibit considerable heterogeneity, including both cell type and cell state within each cell type. Subcutaneous
adipose is an important human endocrine tissue for CMDs, and it is possible to collect high-quality adipose tissue
samples from healthy individuals. However, the contributions of many adipose genes to CMDs and CMD traits
are still poorly understood. The current lack of cell-type expression reference data sets limits fine-scale regional
transcriptional assessment of GWAS variant effects. In addition, local expression quantitative trait locus (cis-
eQTL) analyses are confounded by cell-type-specific expression differences, which hamper replication efforts
across independent bulk RNA-sequenced (RNA-seq) cohorts. To address these knowledge gaps and identify
genetic effects on adipose cell-type gene expression, we will perform single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-
seq) in frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy samples from 300 well-characterized individuals, generate
fine-scale estimates of cell-type proportions, identify study-wide and personalized cell-type-specific differences
corresponding to cardiometabolic trait levels, and experimentally test GWAS variants for allelic effects on cell-
type-specific expression. We hypothesize that by elucidating adipose tissue cell-type expression from 300
existing frozen adipose biopsies, we can leverage available GWAS and adipose bulk RNA-seq data (n=3,230;
45% female) from diverse populations to identify the relevant cell types for hundreds of CMD genes. In our
preliminary studies, we have successfully performed snRNA-seq in frozen human subcutaneous adipose tissue
biopsies and performed multi-omic studies integrating GWAS results with bulk adipose RNA-seq data, identifying
hundreds of colocalized loci for CMD traits. Our approach will leverage the existing wealth of information
available in GWAS and bulk adipose RNA-seq cohorts to elucidate the largely unknown cell types of biological
mechanisms in the adipose tissue that drive CMDs. Success of the proposed study will substantially improve
understanding of cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms of CMD diseases and traits in a key human
metabolic tissue."

prevent age-related cognitive decline in individuals that may be at risk for developing ADRD. While extant data
suggest that well-designed cognitive training paradigms can produce positive real-world change in cognitive
functions, some researchers have suggested that the positive effects attributed to cognitive training may, in fact,
reflect placebo effects. This criticism stems from the fact that, in even the best designed cognitive training studies,
participants cannot be truly blinded to condition. While many cognitive training studies attempt to blind
participants to the intent or purpose of the training (e.g., using an inert control training that participants might
find plausible as an active intervention), because such control training experiences necessarily differ in key ways
from the active training experiences, it has nevertheless been suggested that participants in cognitive training
studies are able to intuit their condition and associated expectations and then show outcomes that are rooted
purely in these expectations. Despite this suggestion appearing frequently in commentaries over the past several
years, there exists little empirical work that directly addresses whether placebo effects may be at play in cognitive
training and whether such effects can be of a magnitude that explains previous results in the field. Here we
propose to overcome this fundamental gap in the field with a large-scale research study designed to explicitly
examine placebo effects in cognitive training. In particular, taking lessons from outside domains that have more
rigorously examined the induction of placebo effects, we utilize both “pure expectation” methods (i.e., verbally
telling participants that an inert training protocol will enhance their cognitive functions) and “associative
learning” methods (i.e., pairing training with subjectively experienced improved performance) in the attempt to
purposefully drive maximal amplitude placebo effects. This will not only serve to resolve the proximal
controversy regarding whether placebo effects in the domain, but if such effects are found, it will serve as a
benchmark for future research (e.g., to potentially harness such effects). We will examine how the size of such
effects may differ across age groups (younger and older adults), across cognitive domains (e.g., fluid intelligence,
working memory, selective attention), and across testing contexts (in-lab versus remote). Finally, as outside
domains have shown that there can be individual differences in the extent of placebo-responsiveness, we will
also examine a set of individual difference variables (e.g., personality) as possible moderators for these
differences. This research will provide a unique and foundational dataset that addresses directly and in a rigorous
manner the extent to which cognitive training effects can be explained by, and/or augmented by, placebos, and
inform future interventions addressing ADRD."

Cellular differentiation involves tightly coupled changes in gene expression, chromatin state, and
sub-nuclear arrangements of chromosomes. Understanding and controlling differentiation
requires understanding how each of these processes occurs dynamically within the same cell and
how they influence one another. Existing techniques can provide genome scale analysis of
interactions or spatial organization of a few chromosomal positions. However, we have lacked a
generalizable framework for simultaneous reconstruction of the overall dynamics of the nucleus
across all three levels. Recent work from our labs has opened up the possibility of achieving such
coupled analysis. Our track first, identify later approach allows many DNA to be simultaneously
tracked in living cells. RNA and DNA seqFISH allows a large number of transcripts and DNA loci
to be imaged in single fixed cells and MEMOIR allows lineage information to be recovered from
endpoint measurements. In this project, we propose to combine live imaging, multiplexed RNA,
DNA, and immunofluorescence measurements, and MEMOIR lineage tracking to capture whole-
genome dynamics of chromosomal loci and chromatin states. Using mouse embryonic stem cells
(mESCs) as a model system, we will study the transition from the pluripotent state to an earlier 2-
cell (2C) like state which shows drastic chromosome re-arrangement and changes in nascent
gene expression patterns. In addition, we will study the chromosomal dynamics of X-inactivation
based on the initial observations that sister X chromosomes are in contact with each other during
early phases of the inactivation process. Both of these biological questions require tracking
chromosomal dynamics and chromatin state simultaneously in single cells. The “Track First and
ID later” approach allows a large number of loci to be tracked in living cells. The combined
MEMOIR approach with multiplex immunofluorescence allows us to infer the kinetics of chromatin
states transitions. Bringing these tools to study X inactivation and 2C state transition will
demonstrate the capability of this approach for addressing a broad range of cell fate decision
questions. We will also develop analysis and visualization tools to integrate genomics (SPRITE)
and imaging data. The technology developed in this project can be readily implemented in human
cell lines and adopted by other labs in the 4DN consortium."

Reproductive health decisions for women with sickle cell anemia (SCA) a congenital hemolytic
anemia that causes multi-organ injury and early death, are limited by a lack of data to inform
contraception choices, pregnancy management or fertility risks. In SCA, the ovaries may be
injured by oxidative and hypoxic-ischemic injury. Hydroxyurea (HU), a medication used to treat
SCA as early as 9 months of age, may affect fertility negatively. In a study evaluating ovarian
reserve in girls with SCA treated with HU, 8 of 33 HU-treated subjects had diminished ovarian
reserve, which was associated with older age and longer duration of HU use. This data supports
that ovarian reserve is compromised in some patients, but the contributions of SCA, SCA
complications or SCA treatments are unknown.
To optimize SCA patient care and to better understand this reproductive biology, carefully
designed studies of ovarian reserve that assess disease phenotype and treatment are needed.
The goal of this research is to conduct a methodologically rigorous evaluation of ovarian reserve
in women with SCA to assess whether SCA or its treatments are associated with diminished
ovarian reserve. This evidence will help clinicians manage patients considering the risks of
untreated SCA against the known and theorized risks of SCA therapies.
The proposed study will investigate whether clinical features of SCA or its primary treatment,
hydroxyurea, are associated with ovarian reserve in SCA by conducting (1) a cross-sectional
study that entails primary data collection of measures of ovarian reserve in women with SCA
and matched controls, and (2) a study of whether HU treatment, clinical and laboratory
biomarkers of SCA are associated with reduced ovarian reserve. As this information will be
incorporated into patient-centered decision making, we will also (3) explore patient knowledge,
experiences and preferences about fertility and SCA therapies.
This research, critical for understanding the effects of SCA and HU on ovarian reserve in
women with SCA, will develop the principal investigator through advanced training in
epidemiology and biostatistics, qualitative research methods and reproductive medicine and
SCA. Few hematologists have this kind of expertise and the principal investigator will be poised
to build an independent research program at the forefront of reproductive health in SCA."

In this 5-year R01 project entitled “Harmonizing data acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis for reproducible,
cross-vendor, open-source MRI,” we address the significant barriers to scientific progress due to the large inter-
scanner variability (often more than 10-20%) present in multi-site MRI data which substantially diminishes the
power of neuroimaging studies to detect subtle pathologies in neuropsychiatric disorders. Inter-scanner biases
are a result of differences in implementation of closed-source product sequences (e.g., gradient and
radiofrequency pulse shapes and timing), the choice of reconstruction algorithms, as well as variations inherent
to the scanner hardware (e.g., gradient strength). Another major challenge is the significant barrier to develop
new sequences for each vendor separately. This inhibits the translation of new MRI technologies to research
laboratories, as vendor-specific sequence development environments are closed-source, proprietary, and suffer
from a steep learning curve.
 In this project, we address these challenges by proposing an “end-to-end” harmonization framework. We
propose to develop and disseminate a single open-source vendor-neutral MRI pulse sequence development
environment containing both standard MRI protocols (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion MRI) and
cutting-edge quantitative acquisitions (T1, T2, T2*, and quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM)), a unified image
reconstruction framework, and novel algorithms for post-acquisition data harmonization to enable multi-site
reproducible research and mitigate inter-scanner variability and bias. Our quantitative MRI acquisitions will be
efficient (5 min as opposed to more than 15 min) and also comprise of fast, distortion-free diffusion MRI
sequences. The performance of standard contrast-weighted protocols and the accuracy of novel quantitative
imaging sequences will be rigorously validated on phantoms and in-vivo data acquired from all major vendors
(Siemens, Philips, GE). Further, we will develop and validate novel data harmonization algorithms that will
remove any remaining scanner-induced discrepancies in the data due to hardware differences. One of the goals
of this project is to reduce inter-scanner variability to the level of those observed within-scanner. The technical
developments proposed in this grant will dramatically increase reproducibility across sites and allow for seamless
execution of multi-site neuroimaging studies. Thus, the increased statistical power of multi-site studies will
facilitate detection of subtle changes in neuropsychiatric disorders. Our open-source first-of-its-kind platform will
also accelerate cross-vendor sequence development and enable immediate translation of new sequences into
research studies (which currently takes several years)."
10874585,"The neurodegenerative proteopathies—a family that includes Huntington disease (HD), Alzheimer
disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and several spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)—are etiologically
heterogeneous but share two striking commonalities: 1) each involves the accumulation of a particular disease-
related protein, and 2) although the disease-related proteins are ubiquitously expressed, each disease affects
one brain region or cell type first, and then ramifies to other brain regions. Many groups, including ours, are
studying ways to reduce levels of the relevant disease-related protein, such as huntingtin (in HD), a-synuclein
(in PD), or Ab (in AD). So far, however, regional vulnerability has not been thoroughly investigated, and lack of
understanding of its causes could cause protein-level-reducing treatments to fail.
 We learned this through studying SCA1, which is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in ATAXIN1,
which encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the protein ATXN1 (Atxn1 is the mouse version of the protein).
In SCA1, the presenting symptom is ataxia because the first brain region to become dysfunctional is the
cerebellum. Eventually, other regions succumb to the disease, producing cognitive alterations and eventually
death due to brainstem failure. We discovered that lowering Atxn1 levels in SCA1 knock-in mice (Atxn1154Q/+)
improves cerebellar function, but not cognition and that loss of Atxn1 function leads to AD-like hippocampal
degeneration by elevating Bace1 and increasing Ab production. Clearly, then, we need to consider regional or
cell-type vulnerability to avoid relieving pathogenesis in one region while inducing new pathology in another.
We had already learned that the polyQ expansion enhances Atxn1's interactions with the transcriptional
repressor Capicua (Cic), which leads to hyper-repression of Cic target genes. In an SCA1 transgenic mouse
model that expresses expanded human ATXN1 only in Purkinje cells, inserting additional mutations (V591A
and S602D) into the expanded ATXN1 allele to block its interaction with Cic restores motor coordination and
prevents Purkinje cell pathology. In the SCA1 knock-in mice, however, blocking the Atxn1-Cic interaction with
these same mutations only partially improved motor coordination, had no effect on hippocampal deficits, and
only a small effect on survival; these results indicate that either cerebellar cell types besides Purkinje cells or
regions beyond the cerebellum contribute to incoordination (which we will investigate in Aim 1) and that
interactors besides Cic are important in brain regions outside the cerebellum (to be investigated in Aim 2). We
also discovered that increasing levels of Atxn1's paralog, Ataxin1-Like (Atxn1L), which compensates for many
of Atxn1's activities, improves cerebellar function in SCA1 knock-in mice (the groundwork for Aim 3, where we
will investigate the effects of increasing Atxn1L on other brain regions). We propose that understanding
regional vulnerability in SCA1 will enable us to devise approaches to safely treat SCA1."

 The purpose of this proposal is to better understand factors that determine the roles that paid caregivers
(personal care aides, home health aides, and other direct care workers) play in the home-based care of
persons with dementia (PWD). The progressive functional and cognitive declines of dementia result in
increasing care needs that family caregivers are not always able to meet. Paid caregivers provide help with
not only functional tasks like bathing or cleaning, but also other care tasks like communicating with the
healthcare team and monitoring chronic conditions that support the overall health of PWD. Yet paid caregivers
are usually studied apart from those they care for. The factors that determine paid caregiver roles in the
person-centered dementia care team are unknown. This project has the following research aims: 1) Examine
the association between intensity (type and quantity) of care provided by paid and family caregivers and
adverse consequences of unmet care needs among PWD living in the community over time using data from
the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS); 2) Explore multiple perspectives (family caregiver, paid
caregiver, and medical provider of persons with moderate or severe dementia receiving home-based medical
care) on the factors (e.g. clinical, social, health system, community) that determine paid caregiver roles and
care team interactions over time using longitudinal qualitative interviews; and 3) Elicit key stakeholder
perspectives (e.g. dementia and caregiving advocacy groups, representatives of LTSS and health care
providers) on policy factors that impact paid caregiver roles in dementia care at home and promising practices
to improve paid caregiver integration in the person-centered care team. Employing complimentary research
methods, completion of these research aims will provide key insights into factors that impact ways that paid
caregivers work with family caregivers to provide comprehensive care and inform the policies and practices
that seek to help PWD continue to live at home. In addition, completion of training aims associated with these
research aims will allow Dr. Jennifer Reckrey to become an independent researcher with a broad skill base in
research methodology (dementia research, longitudinal data analysis, qualitative framework analysis method),
policy understanding (knowledge of community-based long-term services and supports and the paid caregiver
workforce), and subject expertise (interdisciplinary research network to advance paid caregiver role in the care
of PWD). With strong mentorship at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, support from a committed
advisory team, and a program of clearly defined training, the proposed project and career development plan
will enable Dr. Reckrey to conduct independent research that guides health policy to maximize the positive
impact of paid caregivers on PWD living at home."
10874589,"Project Summary
All organisms must maintain a balance of nutrient metals to survive, including zinc (Zn). These metals are
required as catalytic and structural cofactors for a variety of proteins, but in excess can lead to the generation of
reactive oxygen species or inactivation of non-cognate enzymes through mismetallation. Therefore, tight control
of metal levels through import, efflux, and storage is important for optimal growth and survival. Due to this
requirement, bacterial metal homeostasis mechanisms are attractive targets for novel therapeutics. This
proposal seeks to inform the development of metal-based therapies by identifying mechanisms used by the
opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii to prevent metal imbalance. Previous work in our laboratory
has identified zigA which encodes a putative Zn metallochaperone with increased expression upon Zn starvation
mediated by calprotectin, a metal sequestering protein of the innate immune system. Loss of ZigA results in a
severe fitness defect upon calprotectin exposure, indicating the essentiality of ZigA under these conditions. Since
ZigA is critical for A. baumannii to grow under Zn limitation, we hypothesized that proteins that receive metal
from ZigA (clients) are equally important in mediating Zn stress. To identify these clients, I performed a genome-
wide transposon mutagenesis screen in Zn limiting conditions comparing WT and ΔzigA libraries to identify
genes whose fitness is influenced by Zn deficiency and that modulate the fitness of a ΔzigA mutant. I discovered
several genes through this genetic interaction method and chose A1S_3027 for further characterization.
A1S_3027 encodes a lytic transglycosylase that is predicted to tailor the bacterial cell wall. Strains lacking
A1S_3027 are sensitized to Zn deficiency, and this can be reversed upon addition of ZnCl2. We hypothesize that
to ensure the integrity of the cell envelope in conditions of Zn starvation, ZigA interacts with A1S_3027 to regulate
its function. Characterizing A1S_3027 and its coordination with ZigA will be tested in two specific aims. In
Specific Aim 1, I will study the biochemical properties and function of A. baumannii A1S_3027 using
biochemical, genetic, and functional assays to probe how A1S_3027 helps to maintain Zn homeostasis.
Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will determine the functional role of A. baumannii A1S_3027 in
maintaining appropriate nutrient metal balance by employing A1S_3027-deficient strains in a series of in vitro
and in vivo experiments. Taken together, these aims will determine the impact of metal imbalance on A.
baumannii pathogenesis and provide the first description of the contribution of a Zn metallochaperone and its
clients to microbial virulence. Therapeutics that modulate bacterial metal levels will synergize with the immune
system’s defenses, and A1S_3027 may be an attractive target for such metal-focused therapeutics."
10874707,"The human immune system exhibits both specific and non-specific immunity (innate immunity) to defend
against pathogens. The cGAS/STING pathway plays an essential role in innate immunity by sensing
cytoplasmic DNA derived from viral or bacterial infection, and damaged genomic or mitochondrial DNA.
Evading immune destruction is a hallmark of cancer, and loss of STING in certain cancers promotes immune-
resistance. Interestingly, cGAS has been found to promote cellular senescence, and low cGAS expression
correlates with poor outcome in lung cancer. However, whether and how cGAS inactivation is critical for
tumorigenesis, and whether cGAS exerts any innate immunity-independent functions in cancer remain elusive.
Breast cancer constitutes 25% of all cancers in women, making it the most common malignancy in females.
Metastatic disease, rather than primary tumors, causes most death in breast cancer patients, and there is
currently no effective therapeutic options available for this deadly disease. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms governing breast cancer metastasis may lead to development of therapeutic interventions to
target an “Achilles’ heel” this disease.
 Here we provide several lines of evidence to indicate that nuclear cGAS exerts a novel function, which is
independent of its canonical function in innate immunity, in suppressing breast cancer metastasis. First, we
observed levels of nuclear cGAS decreased in metastatic, compared with primary breast cancer. Second, we
found that acetylation of cGAS in its NLS (nuclear localization signal) promoted cGAS nuclear enrichment and
that loss of nuclear cGAS promoted breast cancer metastasis. Third, we identified cGAS as a novel H4K8me1
reader which functions to suppress metastatic gene expression. As a result, deficiency in H4K8me1 binding
significantly facilitated breast cancer metastasis. Given that our informatics analyses in TCGA breast cancer
patients indicated that total cGAS expression did not correlate with metastasis nor disease stage, we will
further determine whether reduced cGAS acetylation (that correlates with reduced nuclear cGAS levels) can be
used as a prognostic marker for metastatic breast cancer using a cohort of primary and metastatic breast
cancer patient samples readily available. In addition, we will examine the molecular mechanisms and biological
consequences underlying the metastasis suppressive function of cGAS using both xenograft and genetic
murine models, along with the initial exploration of therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with this dysregulated
pathway. Overall, our studies have significant implications for metastatic breast cancer, along with new
potential insights relative to breast cancer recurrence. We are hopeful that our studies will facilitate the
development of new therapeutic options for breast cancer patients, with potential relevance to a subset of lung
cancer as well."

This is a renewal application for R01 DK113170 to investigate the role and mechanism of autophagy activation in the regulation of exercise-induced metabolic benefits against type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a sedentarism-associated disease affecting glucose metabolism and a risk factor for other disorders. Physical exercise has been widely recognized to exert beneficial effects against T2D. However, the mechanisms by which exercise elicits systemic metabolic benefits are unclear, which limits the development of therapeutic interventions. Autophagy is an essential intracellular degradation pathway, in which damaged or unnecessary cargos are transported to and broken down in lysosomes. It occurs at a low basal level under normal conditions, and can be induced by stressors such as fasting. We found that exercise is a potent inducer of autophagy, not only in contracting muscle tissues but also systemically in non-contractile tissues such as the liver. The mechanism and metabolic importance of autophagy activation by exercise in non-contractile tissues have never been addressed. Our preliminary data reveal that systemic autophagy activation may be mediated by exercise-induced circulating factors. By proteomic studies we discovered that fibronectin (Fn1), generally considered as an extracellular matrix protein under normal (resting) conditions, is significantly increased in the circulation after acute exercise. Importantly, muscle-specific depletion of fibronectin (FN1[delta]muscle mice) abolishes exercise-induced circulating fibronectin levels, autophagy activation in the liver, and systemic insulin sensitization, suggesting that muscle-secreted fibronectin is an essential regulator of exercise-induced systemic autophagy and metabolic benefits. In addition, knockdown of the fibronectin receptor, α5β1 integrin, abolishes the ability of exercised mouse serum in activating autophagy in cultured cells, further supporting the key role of the fibronectin-α5β1 integrin pathway in exercise-induced autophagy. Based on these data, we propose our overall hypothesis that autophagy activation in non-contractile tissues drives exercise-induced metabolic benefits against T2D, through a fibronectin-α5β1 integrin-IKK-JNK1 pathway. Using a combination of genetic, metabolic, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we propose two aims: Aim 1 is to determine whether exercise activates autophagy systemically in non-contractile tissues via the fibronectin-α5β1 integrin-IKK-JNK1 pathway; and Aim 2 is to determine whether autophagy activation by the fibronectin-α5β1 integrin-JNK pathway in non-contractile tissues mediates exercise-induced metabolic benefits against T2D. Overall, our studies will establish the physiological importance of exercise-activated autophagy in non-contractile tissues in the prevention of T2D, and will demonstrate the previously uncharacterized function and mechanism of the fibronectin-integrin signaling pathway in regulating muscle-liver communication and whole-body metabolism."

Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is an early and fundamental defect in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Molecular mechanisms by which obesity promotes muscle insulin resistance remain incompletely understood,
but multiple lines of evidence suggest aberrant lipid metabolism as a likely contributor. Recently, our laboratory
published findings that accelerated lyso-phospholipid metabolism (Lands cycle) desensitizes skeletal muscle
insulin receptor to promote diabetes. In humans, obesity increased skeletal muscle lyso-phosphatidylcholine
(lyso-PC) acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3) and decreased lyso-PC concomitant to a decrease in insulin sensitivity.
In mice, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of LPCAT3 increased lyso-PC and enhanced skeletal muscle and
systemic insulin sensitivity. In this proposal, we will further exploit skeletal muscle Lands cycle to understand
its role in modulating insulin action. We hypothesize that: 1) Lands cycle modulates plasma membrane
microdomain clustering to amplify insulin signaling, 2) pharmacological inhibition of Lands cycle can ameliorate
hyperglycemia in the Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, and 3) exercise training enhances skeletal muscle insulin
responsiveness by deceleration of Lands cycle."

The United States deployed ~3 million service members to the Middle East since 2001. Approximately 600,000
Veterans now suffer from “Chronic Multisymptom Illness” (CMI). The “Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics
or PACT Act, signed into law in 2022, now exists to mitigate Veteran suffering associated with military burn pit
exposures. The single most common risk factor among these ailing Veterans is inhalation exposure to complex
combustion emissions generated by these burn pits. CMI symptoms include: cardiopulmonary morbidity,
cognitive impairments, behavioral disorders, fatigue/diminished energetics, compromised immune function and
pain. Despite the fact that the number of Veterans suffering from CMI is forecast to surge, two major knowledge
gaps exist: 1) the exposure conditions that lead to CMI are poorly characterized, and 2) the mechanism(s) of
CMI development cannot currently be studied as a model of exposure does not exist. Neither of these gaps can
be properly addressed in the absence of an emission generator capable of mimicking burn pits and their diverse
parameters of operation. The objective of this application is to validate our novel generation system and identify
the most relevant fuel mixtures that accurately recapitulate military burn pit emissions. This will be achieved in
our unique Inhalation Facility located in the WVU Center for Inhalation Toxicology. AIM 1: Determine, optimize
and validate the burn pit surrogate emission generator parameters of operation. We have developed an
automated combustion chamber with a hopper feed system to operate under a variety of temperatures, feed
speeds, and air richness. Combustion is enhanced by a fuel feed system that independently drips jet fuel (the
most common accelerant used in burn pits) into the combustion chamber. The goal is to identify the full range of
these parameters, and couple them with the resultant emissions delivered to the exposure chamber for real-time
aerosol characterization and sampling. AIM 2: Determine the operable proportions of representative mixed fuels
that when combusted, produce reliable and repeatable emissions for real-time aerosol characterization and
inhalation exposures. We manufacture combustible pellets with a variety of raw materials to feed into our
surrogate emission generator. These materials have different combustion temperatures, and varying the mixture
and/or amount/pellet produces different emissions. The goal is to identify a range of mixture proportions that
combust and smolder over the full operating parameters, that produce reliable and repeatable emissions in the
exposure chamber. Upon completion, a novel inhalation exposure instrument will be validated and optimized for
subsequent CMI studies. Fuel mixtures and accelerant delivery rates will be established as the standards for
these studies. Identification of these parameters is critical for rigor and reproducibility, and will also initiate the
foundation for future CMI research that ultimately benefits Veteran health. Added value exists as the surrogate
generator is capable of combusting virtually any substance. Therefore, it will also be invaluable in assessing first-
responder exposures to diverse conditions such as domestic and wildland urban interface (WUI) fires."
10872686,"SUMMARY. We revealed that cancer cells can disseminate from early stages of cancer progression and after
variable periods of dormancy they go on to form metastasis. Knowledge about how early DCCs (eDCCs) shape
metastatic progression, how they remain dormant and immune evasive for years and how they get reactivated,
is limited, but critically needed to develop more effective treatments. We discovered that as the primary tumor
evolves genetically and grows, target organs are seeded by more genetically evolved late DCCs (L-DCCs) that
can be dormant but also may carry more growth prone programs. How the first arriving eDCC and following L-
DCCs crosstalk to affect immune niches in the lung for metastasis development has never been explored. Using
genetic lineage tracing, protein barcoding, and single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) we found that 79% of metastasis
were derived from eDCCs and that eDCCs and L-DCCs cooperate in lungs to initiate metastasis. We also
discovered that dormancy of eDCCs is driven by ZFP281 and NR2F1 and that interaction of eDCC and L-DCC
downregulates NR2F1 expression to cooperatively found metastasis. Mouse models and human data suggest
that immune-surveillance does not fully eliminate eDCCs, but how eDCCs evade immune targeting is unclear.
To this end, we discovered that eDCCs have a low mutational burden, downregulate MHC-I compared to L-
DCCs and upregulate the immune suppressors Gal-1 and TGFβ2. In Lungs with eDCCs CD4 and CD8 T cells
seem to be dysfunctional, as depletion of CD8 T cells does not lead to eDCC outgrowth and treatment with anti-
PD-L1 therapy does cause eDCC eradication. We also find that tissue resident alveolar macrophages (AMs)
maintain dormancy of eDCCs but may contribute to immune evasion while also suppressing metastatic
outgrowth. We hypothesize that eDCCs and L-DCCs cooperate to found metastasis by (a) the ability of L-DCCs
to awaken dormant eDCCs via the production of inhibitors of pro-dormancy pathways and (b) eDCCs creating
immune-suppressive lung niches that allow more immunogenic L-DCCs to escape detection. We will test 1) the
role of clonal cooperation and metastasis founding capacity between eDCC and L-DCCs, 2) the molecular
mechanisms used by DCCs to protect themselves from immune clearance and 3) how L-DCC and lung alveolar
macrophage (AM) crosstalk affects eDCC reawakening and metastatic growth. Exploring these questions will
provide insight into novel immune evasive mechanisms by early and late cooperating DCCs that may be targeted
during dormancy or reactivation with immune targeting approaches to eradicate them. We also may discover
ways to prevent cooperating early and late DCCs from founding metastasis using activators of pro-dormancy
programs. Our work might explain why despite cancer cells disseminating early, removal of early stage tumors
(e.g. DCIS)reduces metastatic relapse, and why PT size is a poor prognosis indicator: namely that early DCCs
remain dormant unless reactivated by late DCCs that are more frequent the later a tumor is removed."

are to: 1) provide technical assistance and consultation to investigators with an emphasis on IS designs,
frameworks, strategies, measures, outcomes, community engaged approaches, and mechanisms of change; 2)
build capacity by educating, training, and providing mentorship to develop a robust generation of AIDS/IS
researchers, and; 3) develop synergy across campus entities, CFAR Cores and through inter-CFAR

ABSTRACT
The CFAR International Core (Core I) mission is developing locally-relevant HIV/AIDS research and research
capacity in Botswana, a country in southern Africa with one of the world’s highest rates of HIV infection. Penn
has deep ties to Botswana, where an excellent infrastructure and strong commitment to promoting HIV-related
research and research capacity have resulted in impactful work over the past two decades. The Core’s missions
are to nucleate new collaborations among Penn and Botswana-based investigators and provide infrastructure
for studies implemented in Botswana that will advance high priority research relevant to the country, and to train
the next generation of US- and Botswana-based HIV/AIDS investigators. The Core’s focus remains cutting edge
by maintaining close relationships and conducting strategic planning with Botswana-based stakeholders
including the University of Botswana (UB) & Ministry of Health (MOH) and working closely with other CFAR
cores for synergy. Core I is led by Drs. Robert Gross, Director (based at Penn) and Merrian Brooks, Co-
Director (based in Botswana), along with Core Investigators Drs. Billy Tsima (at UB) and Andrew Steenhoff
(at CHOP). Operations are facilitated by Drs. Brooks & Tsima being based in Botswana, English being an official
language, and leveraging resources of the institutionally-funded Botswana-UPenn Partnership.
Core I services include (1) consulting on feasibility and local appeal of research ideas targeting issues and
populations in Botswana; (2) engaging key stakeholders and local collaborators to ensure optimal design and
efficient implementation of projects; (3) support for protocols including assistance with IRB submissions and
translation of materials into the local language (Setswana) to allow for full local participation; (4) hiring, training
and supervising local research staff; (5) specimen processing and laboratory analyses or shipping; and (6)
secure data management. Core training activities include mentoring of junior investigators from Penn and
Botswana who are developing HIV-related research in Botswana; partnering with new-to-HIV and/or new-to-
Botswana established investigators; sponsoring seminars at UB and at Penn to disseminate findings & engage
investigators; teaching epidemiology & biostatistics skills to aspiring researchers from the US and Botswana;
laboratory training including hands-on experimental work at Core in-country laboratories.
In the current reporting period, Core I enabled high priority research on HIV acquisition & treatment; the
intersection of severe mental illness and HIV; HIV in children and adolescents; cervical cancer; and nicotine
addiction. Looking ahead, Core I will continue support across all current research domains, with planned
innovations including a focus on wellbeing in areas of smoking cessation, physical and cognitive rehabilitation,
and a consultation service (Sedibeng) for local HIV investigators."

The overarching aim of our current funding (NIH Grant # R01 AG063949-01) is to repurpose the Louisville Twin
Study’s original goal of understanding the etiology of child cognitive development into a true lifespan
developmental twin study of cognition, including delineation of the etiology of preclinical symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. In the current project period, the third independent aim
encompasses modeling effects of cognitive development on cognitive functioning in midlife, adjusting for
confounding genetic and environmental factors. Throughout the life of the Louisville Twin Study (LTS),
however, recorded ability scores have been age standardized, thus making it impossible to estimate effects of
true intraindividual change in cognitive ability over any period of development. Problems with the age-
standardized approach are compounded by the administration of different tests (e.g., moving from the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)) and test
editions (e.g., updating from the WAIS-III to the WAIS-IV) that supposedly measure the same latent cognitive
abilities. Whether they actually do so is an empirical question that has not been addressed previously in any
longitudinal twin study of cognitive ability. All LTS twins’ cognitive ability protocols are available, so individual
items could be used in future analyses. We propose using vertical linking methods that allow the administration
of validated cognitive tasks without requiring age-standardizing cognitive test scores. Child and adult test
content typically is not the same, but there are some items that were administered in childhood that can be
retained in adult tests. For the current data collection, three age-appropriate items from the WISC Block
Design, Similarities, Vocabulary, Arithmetic, and Information subtests will be administered to all returning LTS
adults (projected N = 750). As children, LTS twins completed approximately 10 cognitive ability tests, on
average, half of which were WISC tests. With an estimated five WISC protocols administered to each twin, on
average, there are greater than 73,000 individual subtests to archive and vertically link child and adult
Wechsler ability scores. Item Response Theory models subsequently can be used to place ability scores on
the same scale so that ability trends can be studied and compared across different periods of child and adult
development. Twins’ latent cognitive ability test scores, thus, will be put on the same scale from age 7 through
midlife. Our efforts in the LTS are the first of its kind in longitudinal twin studies of cognitive ability. By linking
childhood cognitive tests to adult tests, we will increase the significance and innovation of our findings by
specifying the lifespan growth functions of ability at the subtest and latent factor levels to model individual
twins’ true intraindividual cognitive ability trajectories."

Although anti-Disialoganglioside (anti-GD2) therapy has significantly improved the survival rates of children
with High-Risk Neuroblastoma (HR-NBL), its clinical utility is severely limited by its life-threatening side effects
and variable response rates. Despite being standard of care for HR-NBL for over 10 years, there are currently
no existing mechanisms to predict whether a child will respond to anti-GD2 therapy. The long-term goal is to
identify predictive biomarkers for response to anti-GD2 therapy and establish a comprehensive understanding
of the therapeutic response mechanism. Our overall objective is to 1) develop a predictive statistical model
for anti-GD2 response using genomic and transcriptomic biomarkers and 2) experimentally characterize the
mechanism underlying this model. The central hypothesis is that genomic changes drive tumor cell
subpopulations with variable immune infiltration and mixed anti-GD2 responses. The rationale for this project
is that identifying predictive biomarkers for anti-GD2 response in Neuroblastoma will improve patient treatment
stratification and help identify strategies for increasing the effectiveness of anti-GD2 therapy. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) Define the role of genomic changes in
Neuroblastoma tumor subpopulations; 2) Characterize the role of tumor subpopulations in immune modulation
and anti-GD2 response; and 3) Generate a predictive multivariate model for anti-GD2 response in
Neuroblastoma. To assist with these aims, an institutional single cell expression dataset will be prepared for 20
Neuroblastoma patients. Diagnostic samples from anti-GD2 responders and non-responders will be
sequenced. Under the first aim, cellular-level genomic changes will be quantified in Neuroblastoma
subpopulations using publicly available and institutional single cell expression data. The second aim has 2
parts. For part one, spatial transcriptomics will be used to analyze 8 patients (4 responders; 4 non-responders)
for well-defined intratumoral tissue states known as sub-tumor microenvironments. For part two, syngeneic
mouse models will be used to assess the immunomodulatory role of the immune checkpoint related gene
CD44 in Neuroblastoma. Finally, the third aim will develop a multivariate model comprising genomic,
transcriptomic, and IHC-based features for anti-GD2 response prediction in HR-NBL. The model will be
applicable to bulk sequencing cohorts and validated in two external cohorts. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because it identifies novel genomic/transcriptomic biomarkers for anti-GD2 response
in Neuroblastoma and seeks to characterize a novel mechanism that explains response. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to improve patient selection for anti-GD2 therapy and provide
much needed insight into mechanisms underlying anti-GD2 response in Neuroblastoma. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential to improve survival rates and uncover novel adjunct treatments."

HLA donor-recipient (D-R) matching is critical for graft outcomes following Kidney, Heart, Lung
and hematopoietic cell transplantation. Genetic association studies in large well-characterized
transplant cohorts are lacking and there is a clear need to characterize how MHC and KIR
genetic variants underpin transplantation outcomes. The International Genetics & Translational
Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN) was formed to increase the understanding
of the genetic architecture of transplant outcomes, by bringing together transplantation studies
with genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets from >52,600 recipients/donors across
well-curated heart, kidney, liver and lung transplant phenotype datasets. This constitutes the
largest solid-organ transplant consortium ever assembled. A strategic Pharma collaboration
where we sequence key HLA Class I and II in the majority of iGeneTRAiN studies, and
additional MHC/KIR regions in subsets of studies, is facilitating ample statistical power to
assess association studies of HLA and KIR with key transplant-related outcomes. A large
portion of the iGeneTRAiN database is derived from non-European ancestry samples, which
greatly addresses the lack of adequate MHC/KIR genetic data in these populations."

This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal supports a 5-year research
and training program for Dr. Jenell Stewart to establish herself as an independent investigator with expertise in
sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevention. Dr. Stewart is an Infectious Diseases physician-scientist
with a strong track record of dedication to STI and HIV research in low-resource settings and extensive
experience in international collaborations. For this proposal, Dr. Stewart will benefit from additional training,
including formal course work and mentorship, in design and analysis of STI and HIV prevention trials,
assessment of sexual exposures and event-driven adherence, and mixed-methods analysis of gendered power
dynamics in adherence behavior. In the past decade, rates of bacterial STIs have increased markedly in
populations worldwide. In addition to increased risk of HIV infections, young Kenyan women have very high STI
rates with severe consequences (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, complications of pregnancy).
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the antibiotic doxycycline (dPEP) has been proposed as a novel STI
control strategy, and dPEP trials among men who have sex with men are ongoing with one completed and
multiple planned. This K23 proposal will leverage the first trial of dPEP among women, launching in Kenya in
January 2020. In contrast to other STI prevention strategies that rely on partner participation, on-demand dPEP
would be woman-controlled; however, little is known about adherence behavior to STI prevention among Kenyan
women. Understanding adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in African women was key to
accurately defining effectiveness in this population, and similarly dPEP adherence will be important to measure
and evaluate. We hypothesize that provision of dPEP with high adherence will substantially reduce the incidence
of bacterial STIs, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis as well as Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma
genitalium. The longitudinal evaluation of M. genitalium in women in the parent randomized trial of dPEP will
provide unique data on this emerging STI. Aim 1 will measure the effect of dPEP adherence on bacterial STI
protection by leveraging a randomized trial of dPEP versus standard risk-reduction counseling among Kenyan
women (N=446) followed for 12 months using hair drug concentrations to determine adherence in a
comprehensive case-cohort analysis. Aim 2 will assess the impact of a recent diagnosis with an STI from point-
of-care STI testing on subsequent longitudinal prevention behavior (adherence to dPEP and PrEP and frequency
of condomless sex) using self-reported behavior validated against biological measures. Aim 3 will determine how
gendered power dynamics relate to adherence behavior using a mixed methods analysis of quantitative and
qualitative measures of gendered power differentials in primary sexual relationships. This proposal will provide
important evidence to avert morbidity and mortality from bacterial STI and HIV acquisition among women."
10875660,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One in 10 children in the U.S. is born preterm and consequently at high risk for long-term cognitive deficits and
poor academic performance. While omega-3 docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) dietary supplements have been
touted to promote cognitive development in children born preterm, several recent studies have produced
suggestive evidence of long-term adverse effects. The long-term goal is to ensure that interventions to help
children born preterm succeed in school are safe and effective. The objective of this application is to determine
the long-term effects of DHA supplementation on general cognitive ability, language, and executive function, and
to examine genetic explanations for treatment effects, by continuing to follow the children from the fully blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial called Omega Tots. The central hypothesis is that children born preterm
who were randomized to 180 days of DHA at age 1 will exhibit poorer general cognitive ability, greater language
deficits, and more impaired executive function at age 9-10 versus children randomized to placebo. The rationale
for this project is that a careful examination of the long-term effects of DHA supplementation will offer valuable
clarification about the appropriateness of DHA as an intervention to promote neurodevelopment among children
born preterm. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 2 specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term effect
of DHA supplementation at age 1 year by comparing general cognitive ability, language, and multiple facets of
executive function between the DHA and placebo arms at age 9-10. 2) Determine the role of variability in fatty
acid metabolism genetics en masse on the effect of DHA supplementation on short and long-term outcomes,
and further focus on 2 previously published FADS2 genetic variants. Under Aim 1, the approach will be an
innovative prospective cohort of children from Omega Tots who will participate in detailed, in-person
assessments at age 9-10 including evaluation by blind assessors and parent and teacher reports of outcomes.
For Aim 2, SNP-based heritability methods will examine the role of fatty acid metabolism genes as measured in
stored blood or saliva to explain observed treatment effects. The proposed research is innovative, in the
applicant's opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by conducting robust,
multi-informant follow-up assessment of general cognitive development, language and executive function of a
large child cohort who participated in a DHA supplementation trial, as well as integrating, for the first time ever,
consideration of fatty acid metabolism genetics as possible explanatory factors for short and long-term adverse
effects. The expected outcome is the determination of the effects of DHA supplementation at age 1 on cognitive
ability, language, and multiple facets of executive function at age 9-10, and new insight into the role of specific
genetic contributors as explanatory mechanisms for short and long-term effects. This contribution is expected to
be significant because, if DHA supplementation has persistent, adverse effects on the neurodevelopment of US
children born preterm, such findings would directly inform clinical recommendations about supplementation."

It is often assumed that animals rapidly adapt behaviorally and physiologically to nutritional challenges and that
adaptations to such challenges carry implications for human health. Very little work has been conducted to
directly test this assumption and our preliminary data indicate that dietary protein restriction exerts effects on
protein motivation that continue once protein intake is normalized. The proposed project will assess the
persistence of the effects of dietary protein restriction on two measures of protein motivation – preference and
economic “demand” – and on the physiological correlates of protein motivation – FGF21 production and
mesolimbic dopamine system activity in response to protein ingestion. The work proposed in this application
will be the first to address the question of how animals adapt behaviorally and physiologically when dietary
protein is normalized following a period of dietary protein restriction. This work will be significant because it will
directly test the assumption, implicit in most work in the field, that animals dynamically respond to nutritional
needs."

 Chemosensation plays a critical role in social behavior among humans and mammals. Olfaction, a form of
chemosensation, is essential for various social behaviors, including maternal behavior and predator detection.
For terrestrial mammals, social interaction is heavily reliant on chemosensory information processed by the
accessory olfactory system (AOS), which is specialized for detecting non-volatile odorants, such as kairomones
(interspecific social cues) and pheromones (conspecific social cues). In the AOS, the initial processing of
chemosensory information takes place in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), where natural AOS ligands activate
vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) through the expression of vomeronasal receptors (VRs). Despite
extensive research, many unknowns exist regarding the natural AOS ligand-receptor pairs, elicited behavior,
and the downstream neural circuitries. My preliminary data revealed that various types of molecules, such as
bile acids, dipeptides, and fatty acids, had distinct levels of abundance in the feces of mouse-fed snakes
compared with those from insect-fed lizards and salad-fed turtles. In addition, the AOS was selectively activated
by fecal extracts from reptiles fed different diets. To explore how mice respond to snake fecal chemosignals, I
developed a layered, hybrid machine learning (ML)-based behavior analysis workflow. This workflow revealed
that snake feces increased risk assessment behaviors in mice that were distinct from other threatening odors,
such as 2,4,5-Trimethylthiazole (TMT). Based on these preliminary data and analytic tools, this proposal seeks
to identify the chemosensory mechanism and associated behaviors elicited by threatening chemosignals from
the snake, a known mouse predator. To do this, I will use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to
determine the natural fecal ligands that activate VSNs. Then, I will implement volumetric VNO Ca2+ imaging via
objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI) microscopy to identify responsive VSN populations to natural fecal
ligands. I will also leverage novel ML-based analytic workflow to comprehensively quantify mouse behavior from
2D/3D video monitoring as animals respond to fecal chemosignals from predatory species. Furthermore, I will
employ whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT) imaging to determine brain-wide activity patterns
elicited by threatening predatory chemosignals. Collectively, this proposal will significantly advance the field by
(1) identifying new kairomone ligands, (2) broadening the range of analytical techniques for studying
chemosensory behavior, and (3) deepening our understanding of chemosensory information processing along
the behaviorally relevant AOS pathway. The successful completion of the proposed experiments will provide a
strong foundation for a R01 grant, including uncovering AOS ligand-receptor interactions at the single-cell level
(Aim 1), examining associated behaviors in high resolution (Aim 2), and exploring the activity patterns triggered
on a brain-wide scale (Aim 3)."

 Calcium ions play critical roles in regulating many biological processes. Mis-regulation of Ca2+
signaling can lead to diseases, and the Ca2+ channels and exchangers are among the most important
drug targets. Proper Ca2+ signaling is also vital for the virulence of many pathogenic organisms. Thus,
a thorough understanding of the Ca2+ signaling is very important for enhancing human health.
 The objective of this project is to study Ycx1, a newly discovered protein required for proper
Ca2+ signaling in yeast. Disrupting Ycx1 results in a decrease in the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and the
activation of calcineurin, a reduced chitin content in the cell wall, an increased sensitivity to thermal
stress, and an impaired respiratory growth. Ycx1 is found in the endoplasmic curriculum (ER) and
Golgi but how it works is not known. Phylogenetics analysis suggests Ycx1 is a cation/Ca2+ exchanger
(CCX), the newest and the least understood family of Ca2+ exchangers. Our hypothesis is that Ycx1
controls Ca2+ release from the ER and Golgi and regulates cellular metabolism by modulating Ca2+
flow from the ER to mitochondria. To achieve our objectives, three specific aims are proposed:
 Aim 1: Characterizing Ycx1 and its role in proper Ca2+ signaling. To characterize Ycx1, we
will first determine its biochemical activity by expressing the protein in E. coli and examine its ability to
transport Ca2+. To test a role of Ycx1 in regulating Ca2+ release from the ER and Golgi, we will use
genetically encoded and organelle specific Ca2+ indicators. To determine how Ycx1 itself is regulated,
we will characterize known Ycx1 phosphorylation sites, identify proteins that interact with Ycx1, and
examine their role in regulating Ycx1 and Ca2+ signaling.
 Aim 2: Determining the mechanisms by which Ycx1 regulates cellular metabolism. Ca2+
is required for the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, and mitochondria and the ER are tethered in
close proximity. We hypothesize Ycx1 facilitates Ca2+ flow from the ER to mitochondria to aid in the
enzyme activation. To test this, we will determine if Ycx1 is required for mitochondrial Ca2+ and
pyruvate dehydrogenase activation during respiratory growth. We will also determine if the tethering of
mitochondria and the ER is crucial for the action of Ycx1 in regulating respiratory growth and Ca2+.
 Aim 3: Characterizing the Ycx1 homolog in Cryptococcus. C. neoformans is a significant
pathogen responsible for over 180,000 annual deaths. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified
a Ycx1 homolog in Cryptococcus. This protein may have similar functions to Ycx1 and could represent
a novel factor crucial for the virulence of Cryptococcus. To assess this, we will examine the effects of
disrupting this homolog in Cryptococcus on calcineurin signaling, chitin level, and sensitivity to 37°C.
We will also examine the subcellular localization of this protein and its transporter activity."
10876985,"The last decade has witnessed a surge in new research findings in neuroscience. So far, however, that
impressive progress has not translated into more effective treatments, or better outcomes, for patients with
serious mental illness. Although this may just be a matter of time, another contributing factor is the lack of
physician scientists in the field of clinical neuroscience. Physician scientists are uniquely capable of linking
basic science findings to the clinical phenomenology of psychiatric illness. Indeed, scientists like these - with
both clinical and research training - are uniquely poised to bridge the gap between basic neurobiology and
clinical disease. This combination is critical for advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric
disorders - and for developing the highly needed disease-modifying treatments for psychiatric illnesses.
One of the explanations for the lack of clinician-scientists is the difficulty in obtaining grant funding right after
residency. This proposal aims to fill that gap. In a two-three year fellowship we will provide intense research
training for a select group of psychiatrists (or PhD psychologists). Upon completion, trainees should be able to
apply successfully for individual grants and develop into independent clinical neuroscientists. We aim to create
clinician-researchers who can combine clinical knowledge with superior research skills. The long-term goal is
to help shape the new generation of leaders in clinical neuroscience. Drs. Kahn, Malaspina and New are each
renowned physician scientists who combine clinical expertise with deep research and training experience.
This program will fill an important gap in the otherwise impressive translational research program at the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), recognized as a top ten innovative research engine worldwide by
Nature. Indeed, the Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry are ranked #1 and #6 respectively in NIH
funding. We already have extensive experience, and a successful track record, in supporting other research
career pathways, including a Physician-Scientist residency research track for MD, PhD trainees, and the first
Combined Psychiatry Residency and PhD Training program in the US, funded by an NIMH R25 grant, of which
Dr. New is PI. We also have 6 K awardees and 2 K99/R00 investigators in our rich training programs.
The proposed T32 fellowship program is designed to train psychiatrists and clinical PhDs to formulate original
research questions on etiology, pathogenesis, course, treatment and prevention of serious mental illness. Its
focus is on patients with schizophrenia and major mood disorders. Each trainee, paired with a mentor, will
formulate a career development plan with targeted goals for acquisition of skills, presentations, publications,
gathering pilot data, and preparation of proposals for external funding - usually a career development award.
Regular meetings, internally and with an external advisory board, will monitor trainee development in relevant
milestones. We aim to help fill the dearth in clinical neuroscientists so that the recent advances in
neuroscience can be translated into better care for the millions of patients with serious mental illness."
10876990,"Clinical and epidemiological studies have consistently connected HIV infection with increased risk of cardio-
vascular disease (CVD). This is due to dysregulated health status associated with residual virus replication,
release of soluble viral proteins, and HIV-induced immune activation, which may also be associated with
premature immune senescence and persistent inflammation. Chronic inflammation is associated with
acceleration of atherosclerosis (AS) and is increasingly prominent among the HIV+ individuals on cART.
Monocytes respond to inflammatory stimuli and are precursors of the macrophages within atherosclerotic
lesions, including lipid-laden foam cells, and lesion-associated macrophages represent a major source of a
number of cytokines and chemokines that direct monocytes into vascular lesions, thus creating a positive-
feedback loop. Differentiation of monocytes is enhanced upon interaction with platelets. We and others have
shown that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) are increased during HIV infection and CVD. Therefore, we
propose to investigate a hypothesis that the PMCs promote atherogenic processes in persons with HIV by
triggering monocyte differentiation through horizontal transfer of micro-RNA and protein encapsulated in the
platelet-derived microparticles (PMs) to the monocytes and thereafter their interaction with endothelial cells. To
test these hypotheses in first aim we define and model molecular networks in monocytes that have or have not
interacted with activated platelets in HIV+/- patients with/without carotid plaques using state-of-art CITE-seq. We
will employ discrete-state modeling approaches to identify pathways and subnetworks dysregulated in HIV+
individuals with carotid plaques. In second aim, we propose to characterize micro-RNA (miRNA) and proteins
encapsulated in platelet-derived microparticles by small-RNA sequencing and proteomics in HIV+/- individuals
with/without carotid plaques. The list of miRNAs and proteins will be integrated with the network model from aim
1 to simulate the effect on signaling cascades and their cross-talk. The network model will reveal the role of
miRNAs and proteins on the monocyte differentiation into pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additional analysis by
machine-learning techniques will allow further prioritization and selection of genes. The ex-vivo experiments will
test binding to human carotid endothelial cells and receptiveness of endothelial cells to the differentiated
monocytes. In conclusion, our multidisciplinary approach of integrated omics, computational modeling and ex-
vivo experiments will reveal mechanisms by which AS is prematurely induced in HIV+ individuals, novel targets
to curb AS in HIV+ individuals and biomarkers for early detection of AS. This study holds strong prospects to
significantly improve aging related comorbidities in persons living with HIV in general and AS in particular."
10876993,"SUMMARY
Genes encoding RNA splicing factors are the most common class of mutations in patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS) and are also common across all other forms of myeloid malignancies. These leukemia-
associated “spliceosomal mutations” primarily occur in four genes: SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. In
three of these four genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1), the mutations occur at specific amino acid residues in
a heterozygous manner (so-called “mutational hotspots”) and cause gain/alteration of function. In contrast,
mutations in ZRSR2 occur throughout the open reading frame and appear to confer loss of function. Moreover,
ZRSR2's normal function makes it unique amongst the commonly mutated RNA splicing factors in leukemias:
ZRSR2 is the only frequently mutated factor that primarily functions in the recognition of a rare class of introns
known as “minor introns.” Thus, ZRSR2 mutations are significantly enriched in leukemia and exhibit a unique
genetic spectrum and function amongst recurrent spliceosomal mutations, yet they are comparatively poorly
studied and understood compared to mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1.
 Here, we propose to determine the mechanistic, functional, and therapeutic consequences of ZRSR2
mutations in leukemia. Our interdisciplinary team consists of a physician-scientist with expertise in leukemia
biology and patient care (Abdel-Wahab) and a basic scientist with expertise in RNA splicing and functional
genomics (Bradley). As minor introns are far more conserved than are most other introns, we hypothesize that
a cross-species comparisons of the effects of ZRSR2 loss will be particularly useful for understanding how
molecular alterations in splicing drive malignant transformation. In addition, we hypothesize that aberrant
splicing induced by ZRSR2 loss will enable novel therapeutic approaches. In preliminary experiments, we
generated a Zrsr2 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse, assembled a relevant patient cohort, characterized the
transcriptomes of our Zrsr2 cKO mouse and ZRSR2-mutant MDS, and performed a functional genomic screen
to model and prioritize ZRSR2-regulated splicing events. These studies revealed that ZRSR2 mutations cause
mis-splicing of a compact set of genes, that Zrsr2 loss promotes aberrant and increased hematopoietic stem
cell self-renewal, that simultaneous ZRSR2 and TET2 collaborate to drive malignancy, and that mis-splicing of
specific downstream targets of ZRSR2 promotes clonality. We propose to build on these preliminary studies as
follows: Aim 1, Determine how ZRSR2 mutations dysregulate the transcriptome and proteome in leukemia;
Aim 2, Determine how disruption of ZRSR2-regulated splicing events drives clonal advantage; Aim 3, Identify
the functional basis for the frequent co-occurrence of ZRSR2 and TET2 mutations in leukemia. The
significance of these studies is that they will elucidate mechanistic and functional connections between
ZRSR2 mutations, RNA mis-splicing, and the initiation of myeloid neoplasms. The health relatedness is that
the proposed work may reveal new therapies for MDS and leukemia that specifically kill ZRSR2-mutant cells."

outreach, and coordination unit for the consortium that will manage operations, essential standards
development and documentation, provide operational transparency, and identify and coordinate solutions to
key hurdles for collaboration and analysis. In addition to organizing virtual and in-person meetings of the
BICAN network and working groups this unit will improve interoperability and alignment with other consortia
and partners and aim to improve usage for a wide range of potential data consumers. Complementing these
fundamental operational goals of the BICAN consortium and partner CUBIE units, this unit will provide a
governance structure for generation and operational transparency of BICAN data production and release and
standards development. Essential activities will include technical management and facilitation of community
standards, schemas, and ontology development, and centralized consortium data registration and dashboard,
and coordinating and organizing BICAN outreach, training, and education activities to enhance interactions
with external research programs and consortia. The resulting consortium generated data and tools will be
made publicly accessible in a community portal supporting data retrieval, consortium activities, amplify public
impact through strong BICAN partnership management, communication, standards committees, and analysis
working groups, and develop infrastructure for maximizing community usage, publishing standards and
tutorials, and coordinating education and outreach."

We will investigate whether therapeutic targeting of Tip60, a histone/protein acetyltransferase essential for the
functions and survival of Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) can significantly decrease Treg functions in vivo while
preserving conventional T cell responses, leading to inhibition of lung tumor growth in murine models. We will
also assess the effects of Tip60 targeting on the DNA damage response within tumors induced by conventional
therapies for lung cancer, including irradiation and cisplatin therapy. We have developed Tip60 PROTAC
(proteolysis targeting chimeric) molecules that recruit the Cereblon E3 ligase so as to promote Tip60
degradation, and we employ Cereblon knock-in (CrbnI391V) immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice in compound
screening and tumor models to facilitate identification of compounds for subsequent clinical development.
Aim 1 - Can Tip60i limit growth of tumors in immunocompetent hosts by decreasing Foxp3+
Treg suppressive function? We have developed several Tip60i, including Crbn- and VHL-based PROTAC
compounds. We will test if Tip60i PROTAC compounds can modulate Treg function and control growth of
experimental lung cancers by (1.1) optimizing Tip60i PROTAC compounds, and testing them (1.2) alone, or in
conjunction with (1.3) vaccination or (1.4) checkpoint inhibitor therapy in CrbnI391V mice. We will also assess
effects of Tip60i on 1.5) normal human Treg and/or Teff cells, and 1.6) human lung cancer associated Treg
cells.
Aim 2 – Determine if Tip60i disrupts DDR actions essential for tumor cell survival. Our
molecular investigations will explore Tip60-dependent mechanisms that promote cellular resistance to genome
instability and normal programmed mechanisms of death, and which underpin cancer initiation and
chemotherapeutic resistance crucial for lung cancer cell survival. We will test if Tip60i compounds have direct
anti-tumor effects by disrupting 2.1) Tip60-dependent p53 activation and/or 2.2) DNA repair mechanisms.
Our studies will facilitate the development of new strategies for immunotherapy in patients with malignancies,
given that the new Tip60-directed therapies have dual mechanisms of action, involving targeting Foxp3+ Treg
cells and intrinsic tumor cell responses to therapy. The data to be generated will likely lead to clinical trials in
patients with lung cancers, and should also have relevance to additional individuals, given the increasingly
recognized potential for immunotherapy in the management of many other types of cancers."
10876895,"The overall aim of this application is to better understand the heterogeneity in glucagon secretion and action
that we have observed in nondiabetic subjects. Abnormal glucagon secretion in the post-prandial period is
recognized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. While glucagon’s actions on glucose
metabolism are reasonably well characterized, there is little understanding as to why individuals differ in their
hepatic responses to this hormone. More importantly, it appears that the actions of glucagon to enhance
hepatic clearance of amino acids is impaired in people with hepatic steatosis. Although there is some evidence
that glucagon stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, a review of the literature suggests that these aspects
of glucagon’s actions have been ignored. In addition, there is no understanding as to whether the ability to
stimulate endogenous glucose production and gluconeogenesis is independent of actions on amino acid and
lipid metabolism. In rodents, α-cells mass is, in part, regulated by circulating amino acid concentrations which,
in turn stimulate glucagon secretion (increasing hepatic clearance of amino acids). Whether this liver-α-cell
axis is extant in humans is uncertain. However, our preliminary data shows that with caloric restriction fasting
glucagon decreases in concert with fasting concentrations of several amino acids. Since caloric restriction is
known to ameliorate hepatic steatosis and improve insulin action, this provides an opportunity to assess how
changes in hepatic fat content alter the response to glucagon – specifically as it applies to carbohydrate,
protein, and fat metabolism. As part of our prior work we have developed new methods to quantify glucagon
secretion in vivo so that our proposed experiments will also examine how acute changes in circulating amino
acid concentrations alter α-cell function. The experiments we propose will provide novel new information about
glucagon secretion and action in humans."
10877072,"ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among women living in the United
States. Progress in identifying modifiable risk factors of CVD has been slow. Growing evidence supports the
idea that pregnancy may be a stress test for future CVD risk and also a sensitive window of exposure for
endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and women’s CVD risk. Our study will address the critical need to
evaluate EDC exposures in pregnancy and midlife to determine whether these chemicals increase CVD risk
across the reproductive life course—a key time period of CVD risk factor development. We will focus on
exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of ubiquitous, persistent chemicals. Our
scientific premise is strong as prior studies and our preliminary data suggest that exposure to certain PFAS are
associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in both pregnant and non-pregnant women. However,
previous studies have not prospectively evaluated CVD risk factor development between pregnancy and mid-
life or examined replacement PFAS chemicals. The objective of this study is to determine whether
exposures to legacy and replacement PFAS alter CVD risk in women across their reproductive lives. Our
central hypothesis is that higher exposure to PFAS during pregnancy and through midlife alters the trajectory
of CVD risk, first emerging in pregnancy as hypertension disorders of pregnancy (HDP), with subsequent
emergence of CVD risk factors (i.e. obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) in midlife. This
hypothesis will be tested through 3 aims using data from Project Viva, a longitudinal cohort study of 1,563
pregnant women with existing pregnancy PFAS data, of which 1198 are currently participating in a 20 year
follow up study. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the association between legacy PFAS concentrations measured at
1st trimester of pregnancy with trajectories of systolic and diastolic blood pressure across pregnancy, and HDP
(i.e. gestational hypertension and preeclampsia). In Aim 2, we will examine associations of legacy PFAS
concentrations in pregnancy and the change in PFAS concentrations from pregnancy to midlife with CVD risk
factors (e.g., body mass index, weight change since index pregnancy, central obesity, fasting glucose, insulin,
hemoglobin A1c, hyperglycemia, blood pressure, hypertension, lipid levels, and dyslipidemia) during midlife
(i.e.,20 years following pregnancy). In Aim 3, we will assess the association of legacy and replacement PFAS
in mid-life with CVD risk factors in midlife. Across all aims, we will examine exposure to individual PFAS and
their mixtures using advanced statistical techniques. The innovative aspects of our proposal include: evaluation
of pregnancy as a susceptible window for EDCs and women’s CVD risk, examination of next-generation PFAS,
and use of a large, well-characterized cohort that is undergoing 20 year follow up. Our findings will fill an
important gap about the impact of environmental chemicals on an understudied time period—between
pregnancy and midlife—with implications for CVD prevention and risk reduction."
10875785,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Alcohol and nicotine are the two most commonly consumed licit drugs among pregnant people. Although
the potential consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure at different levels are well understood, the patterns of
nicotine consumption have changed over the years with the popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-
cigarettes can increase a drug’s presence in blood levels more than traditional routes, which is particularly
alarming given that alcohol and nicotine are commonly used together among pregnant people. However, the
potential consequences of combined alcohol and nicotine exposure via e-cigarettes during early developmental
on brain and behavioral development are unclear. This project will use a mouse model to investigate whether
co-exposure to these drugs during early development alters drug metabolism, shifts intestinal microbiome
populations, changes gene expression, and/or modulates later-life behaviors. Dams and their neonates will be
exposed to alcohol, nicotine via e-cigarettes, the combination, or a control condition (vehicle or ambient air)
during the brain growth spurt period using a novel co-exposure model that mimics the doses and delivery devices
currently seen in human consumption. Aim 1 of this project will examine whether developmental co-exposure of
alcohol and nicotine via e-cigarettes increases blood levels of each drug, alters drug metabolism enzymes in the
liver, increases serum triglyceride levels, and/or shifts the gut microbiota composition. Plasma will be collected
from the dams to examine blood alcohol and nicotine concentrations during exposure. Additionally, plasma, fecal
and cecal matter, and liver tissue will be collected from both the dams and offspring to measure serum triglyceride
concentrations (colorimetric assay), drug metabolism enzymes (western blot), and microbiota shifts (shotgun
metagenomic sequencing and 16s rRNA sequencing) following acute (dams) and developmental (offspring)
exposure. Aim 2 of this project will determine whether developmental co-exposure to alcohol and nicotine via e-
cigarettes alters motor- and anxiety-related behaviors and/or correlated gene expression in the associated brain
regions. Later in life, sex pairs from each litter will be examined for motor- and anxiety-related behaviors using
open-field activity chambers, a forelimb reaching task, and an elevated plus maze. Critical motor- and anxiety-
related brain regions of subjects will also be analyzed to examine gene expression alterations via reverse
transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). These data will provide valuable information regarding the
potential consequences of e-cigarette use among pregnant people, particularly when used in combination with
alcohol. In addition to providing information for teratology research, these data will also be valuable to general
research in substance use and pharmacology. Importantly, all data will be collected and analyzed by graduate
and undergraduate students in the Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry departments at West Chester University.
This project will enable students in the project-associated labs to advance their research professional
development and prepare them for future Ph.D. and medical school programs."
10875970,"The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is an essential biomolecule for all forms of life. Numerous
enzymes rely on the proper functioning of Moco for normal physiological functions. Failures to
biosynthesize Moco cause severe physiological distress and even childhood death. Outside the
protein environment, this cofactor is unstable and has not yet been chemically synthesized. The
Moco has several redox active components, and together, these components can carry out up to
ten-electron chemistry, while in most cases, the substrate transformation requires only two
electrons. To understand how different components stabilize the electronic structure that supports
reactivity, we will investigate discrete molecules with defined features. The work outlined in this
proposal seeks to complete the synthesis of the closest chemical mimic of Moco. While in the
reduced state, Moco is unstable outside the protein environment, and how it is stabilized within a
protein is not clear. The proposal also seeks to understand the geometric and electronic
properties of Moco in the DMSO reductase family of enzymes using periplasmic nitrate reductase
(NapA) and its variants as a model through biochemical and biophysical studies. The specific
aims of the proposal are: 1) to synthesize pterin Mo-centers and Mo=X (X=S, O) complexes
allowing investigation of their geometric and electronic structures in relation to reactivity; 2) to
understand the geometric, electronic, and functional properties of the Mo-center in the DMSOR
family using NapA as a model. Overall, new important molecular-level knowledge will be
generated about the structure-function of a class of enzymes important to human health."

10878852,"RCA PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of our P01, Deploying High Value Longitudinal Population-Based data in Dementia
Research (DEVELOP AD RESEARCH), is to create an integrated program of research that considers the
wider medical, health system, and social contexts of dementia that are important to patients and families and
that have been inadequately considered in prior research. Our specific focus is on research questions that
demand the use of population-based data resources and cannot be addressed by more mechanistically
focused studies in a timely or cost-efficient manner. The P01 supports research that: a) examines the complex
interaction of dementia and other serious illness; b) identifies the impact of clinical and social disruptive events
on disease trajectory and outcomes; c) explores medication prescribing in the context of dementia; and d)
examines how models of community-based care (hospice and home-based medical care) meet the needs of
people with dementia and their families over the duration of illness. Leveraging our track record conducting
groundbreaking research employing the rich, comprehensive, and longitudinal data of the HRS and NHATS,
we will create the knowledge needed to enhance quality of life for persons with dementia and their caregivers.
 RCA will provide coordination and oversight of the P01 as well as the vision and leadership needed to
advance and to translate our research findings into improvements in care. The specific aims of RCA are:
· SA 1: To support scientific innovation for older adults with dementia by ensuring regular, ongoing
 coordinated scientific interaction, planning, learning and feedback between all cores and projects, and
 effective use of shared resources with optimal efficiency;
· SA 2: To provide day-to-day management, including the preparation of administrative documents;
 management of fiscal matters of all projects and cores including oversight of all budgets, resources, and
 sub-contracts; and manage data use agreements, data security, human subjects review;
· SA 3: To monitor research progress, implement necessary remediation, and ensure timely publication and
 dissemination of research findings;
· SA 4: To leverage our national roles in the OAIC Network and National Palliative Care Research Center to
 disseminate our findings, resources, and programming codes and provide “office hours” and resources to
 early stage investigators across the nation engaged in population-based research programs in dementia.
 RCA advances population-based research in dementia and its translation into clinical practice through a
comprehensive framework of coordinated activities. This framework provides infrastructure for research,
nurtures and facilitates collaboration, promotes the use of cutting-edge methodologies, and disseminates
results to the scientific and policy communities. RCA also incorporates an innovative focus on career
development for early stage investigators and promotes the use of HRS and NHATS for dementia research."
10878855,"RCB PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed program project, Deploying High Value Longitudinal Population-Based data in Dementia
Research (DEVELOP AD RESEARCH), will leverage two national, longitudinal, population-based studies, the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), both of which
are linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) claims and assessment files, to expand our
understanding of the longitudinal course of dementia and the complex interactions of medical, social, and
health system factors. Research Core B (RCB) – Quantitative Analytics and Data Management will support
the goals of the P01 and its five research projects through four specific aims: 1) To consolidate HRS, NHATS,
and linked CMS database management activities to promote scientific rigor and efficiency throughout the P01;
2) To build the processes and infrastructure, including staff and investigators, to maximize efficient and
synergistic application of our knowledge and resources; 3) To provide state-of-the-art quantitative analytic
support for research projects; 4) To create and disseminate a library of publicly available web-based technical
assistance material to advance geriatric palliative care and dementia research. Comprised of scientists from
the University of California San Francisco and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the core creates a
transdisciplinary research team of clinician scientists, health services researchers, economists,
epidemiologists, and biostatisticians with expertise in the novel and complex programming, analytic tools, and
statistical methods that are required to effectively use the HRS and NHATS datasets to examine the complex
issues that arise across the disease course from dementia diagnosis to death and provide answers to relevant
clinical and policy questions in dementia care. RCB is the means through which synergies and efficiencies in
quantitative analytic expertise and database management will be achieved in order to successfully complete
the proposed work in each research project. RCB leaders, Drs. Boscardin and Kelley, have the expertise and
experience to accomplish the RCB’s aims through active collaboration with research project investigators,
consultants and analytic staff - all of whom have extensive expertise in managing and analyzing Medicare
linked HRS and NHATS data. RCB will consolidate database management activities by centralizing
administrative and regulatory functions; creating and cataloging a unified set of variables to be used by all
research projects, merging and cleaning datasets needed for the individual research projects including creating
longitudinal hierarchical datasets for analyses, and performing all associated documentation."
10878857,"RP1 Project Summary:
Background: Healthcare spending is highly concentrated among a small seriously ill population and, despite
high spending, quality of care for this group is often low, marked by poor communication, high burden of pain
and other symptoms, and preference-discordant treatments. A key subset of this seriously ill population,
persons with dementia (PWD), may experience the greatest burden of serious illness due to dementia’s long
course of illness, progressive functional impairment, and high degree of caregiver strain, the impact of which is
often magnified among vulnerable and underserved subgroups. These issues are not well characterized over
the course of illness and very little is known about the experience of those with both dementia and another
coexistent serious illness, such as advanced cancer or heart failure.
Aims: This project aims to contribute rich, prospective patient-centered evidence examining the longitudinal
experience of PWD and another coexistent serious illness and their families with additional focus on disparities
in outcomes among socially vulnerable and underserved populations. We will: 1) examine among PWD the
prevalence of another coexistent serious illness over time until death; 2) evaluate differences in treatment
intensity (i.e., total Medicare costs, total hospital days, days away from home) annually and cumulatively until
death, among person with dementia alone and those with dementia and another serious illness; and 3) assess
differences in patient and family experience of care (i.e., caregiving hours, caregiver strain, care-setting
transitions, nursing home admission and in-hospital death), among persons with dementia alone and those
with dementia and another serious illness. In each aim, we will study differences across vulnerable subgroups.
Methods: We will assemble a novel, prospectively-framed sample of PWD combining the nationally-
representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)
cohorts and follow them through the full course of dementia until death. Using currently available data, we will
capture over 7000 individuals at the interview when probable dementia was first identified, and combine their
longitudinal survey data with Medicare claims data through time of death, to investigate differences in
treatment intensity and experience of care between those with dementia alone and those with dementia and
another serious illness (e.g., advanced heart failure).
Public Health Significance: Older adults with dementia and another coexistent serious illnesses and their
families are at risk for suffering due to low-quality, high-cost care, yet little prospective data on their
experiences exist. This project will examine the longitudinal experience of PWD and their families beginning
when dementia was first identified, and compare these experiences to those with another serious illness, such
as advanced cancer or heart failure. By examining patient and families’ experiences prospectively and over the
full course of illness, we can begin to appropriately target the interventions needed to improve care."
10879120,"Project Summary:
Actin filaments and microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers essential for cell division, motility, and intracellular
transport, and deficiencies in these proteins are implicated in cancer, heart disease, and other disorders. In order
to facilitate vital tasks that span the entire cell, these filaments coordinate with each other through motor proteins,
such as kinesin and myosin, and associated binding proteins. The molecular basis for this communication
through tension and compression forces and how these signals propagate through the cytoskeleton is not well
understood. Approaches to study such cytoskeletal phenomena have traditionally been either at the single
molecule level or whole cell level, and the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons have generally been evaluated
as separate systems in vitro. While single molecule experiments, with methods such as optical trapping, have
been invaluable in deciphering the mechanics of individual motors, a completely reductionist approach with one
filament and one motor protein does not accurately represent the structural hierarchy in which crosslinking
motors and proteins function. On the other hand, cell level studies take place in a quite complex environment. In
this research plan, we will bridge the gap in scale and assay control by engineering novel, physiologically relevant
cytoskeletal environments, or nanocells, in which to probe motor protein mechanics and cytoskeletal crosstalk.
Much like LEGOs, we can choose which cytoskeletal elements to incorporate in our nanocell’s architecture and
tune the building blocks accordingly to understand how changes at the molecular level propagate to system level
force generation and network stiffness. Using this innovative approach, our overarching goal is to provide a
fundamental molecular understanding of how motors, crosslinkers, filaments, and signaling factors communicate
with each other in ensembles and to the local cytoskeletal environment utilizing optical trapping, quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation, and spectroscopic techniques. Specifically, we will investigate how myosins work
together in ensembles in actin assemblies and what molecular components dictate productive force generation.
Hybrid nanocells that consist of elements from both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton will be probed to
understand how polymers of different stiffnesses, crosslinking proteins with different pliability, and motor proteins
with varying processivity and force generation capability affect cytoskeletal crosstalk. As E-hooks are the
diversity site of tubulin and uniquely influence motility in disparate kinesin families, we will interrogate how E-
hook structure affects ensemble kinesin force generation in nanocells. The proposed research will pave the way
to our long-term goal, which is not only to understand fundamental mechanisms that sustain life, but ultimately
be able to reconstitute physiologically realistic models of cellular processes in vitro, providing an enormous
potential for developing diagnostic and treatment strategies for cytoskeletal diseases."
10877434,"Abstract:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell tumor preceded by a defined preneoplastic
state termed as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Strategies to
effectively intercept/prevent clinical malignancy remain an unmet need and are the focus of this
application. Changes in microbial communities have been extensively studied in the context of
cancer outcomes and therapy. However, very few causal relationships between specific microbes
and human malignancies have been defined, and suitable models to study these interactions are
lacking. It is increasingly appreciated that MM/MGUS originate in the setting of prior chronic
inflammation and B cell activation, but the underlying triggers remain unknown. This application
involves three PIs (Dhodapkar, Flavell, Palm) with complementary expertise and a track record
of productive collaboration. The application is based on exciting preliminary data describing the
discovery of a commensal microbial species that directly engage several human MM-associated
B-cell receptors. This is supported by data from new humanized models to study interactions
between the human immune system and microbial communities in vivo. The proposal also utilizes
biospecimens from MGUS patients treated with a short course of antibiotics to reduce pathogenic
bacteria. Studies proposed in this application will characterize the full spectrum of human gut
microbes that can potentially serve as antigenic triggers for human B cells and MGUS. It will also
evaluate causal relationships between specific microbes and activation of human B cells as well
as MGUS cells utilizing newly developed models. Finally, it will evaluate how microbial
manipulation in MGUS patients can impact the inflammatory microenvironment known to be
present and implicated in the pathogenesis of MGUS and its transition to clinical malignancy.
Together, these studies may lead to novel approaches for immune-prevention of clinical MM by
targeting the underlying precursor states such as MGUS. Insights from these studies may also
have implications for interactions between specific microbes and human B cells, broadly
impacting human autoimmunity and cancer immunotherapy."
10887513,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Despite not living with HIV, HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children experience higher levels of morbidity
and mortality in childhood and have worse cardiometabolic outcomes, compared to HIV-unexposed (HU)
children. HEU children have suboptimal immune development in early life. This increases their risk for comorbid
infections in childhood, and may exacerbate cardiometabolic risk by leading to increased systemic inflammation
that adversely impacts metabolic pathways. Our group has used metabolomics to characterize metabolic
dysfunction starting in early life and have identified early life infections as a driver of systemic inflammation and
the development of pro-atherogenic metabolic profiles in childhood. Thus, the higher burden of infections in early
life among HEU children may represent and important and unexplored pathway in the pathogenesis of
cardiometabolic dysfunction. In this proposal, we leverage the Drakenstein Child Health Study, a well-
characterized cohort of HEU and HU participants followed from birth, to investigate how HIV-exposure and early
life infections affect inflammatory response changes to the metabolome from birth to early adolescence, and
evaluate how these changes influence the development of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in early
adolescence. Aim 1 will characterize longitudinal metabolomic trajectories from infancy to early adolescence
using 250 metabolites among HEU (n=244) and HU (n=735) children over different developmental stages. Aim
2 will develop a set of predictive models to identify metabolomic profiles in childhood (1 and 5 years) that predict
cardiometabolic dysfunction, including higher BMI/adiposity, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and
insulin resistance, in early adolescence (10 years). Aim 3 will evaluate if relationships between early life infection
burden and metabolomic profiles at 10 years of age are mediated by inflammatory pathways, overall and by HIV
exposure status. The proposed study will make significant contributions to the field of HIV by providing some of
the first longitudinal metabolomic data from a population-based cohort of HEU and HU participants to elucidate
the molecular pathways underlying the development of cardiometabolic dysfunction starting in infancy. In
addition, findings from this proposal have direct clinical relevance by identifying metabolic and inflammatory
biomarkers in early life to support cardiometabolic risk stratification and inform whether future intervention efforts
to address cardiometabolic health in HEU should include reducing infection burden or severity. Taken together,
this work will provide novel mechanistic data and biomarker identification that will inform whether HEU should
be targeted for screening and intervention efforts in childhood to reduce their risk of cardiometabolic disease."
10887653,"Project Summary
 The proposed research seeks to develop metal-catalyzed C–C and C–N bond-forming methodologies that
streamline organic synthesis by leveraging the unique control that electrochemistry provides over electron trans-
fer events. In particular, this work will develop synthetic methodologies based on dual-catalyst systems. One
catalyst is electrochemically activated to mediate the formation of alkyl radicals, while a second catalyst selec-
tively activates the complementary substrate to effect coupling with the electrogenerated radicals.
 The long-term goal of this program is to establish electrochemistry as a standard synthetic strategy in a way
that complements the successful integration of photoredox catalysis into organic synthesis: another dual-catalyst
system that relies on one catalyst to promote electron transfer and a second to mediate bond-forming reactions.
The proposed research relies on the merger of multiple scientific fields to develop next-generation methodologies
in organic synthesis. The Sevov team has a unique combination of expertise in synthetic methodology, mecha-
nistic organometallic chemistry, and homogeneous electrochemistry that will lead to new synthetic strategies
that impact both the rate of discovery and large-scale synthesis of new therapeutic agents. These strategies and
the targeted transformations of the proposal are summarized below:
Goal 1. to develop C–C and C–N coupling reactions with alkyl electrophiles: Electrochemically-driven
cross-coupling will be developed using a dual-catalyst system that allows each substrate to be activated by a
distinct catalyst. Dedicated electrocatalysts will be developed that mediate formation of alkyl radicals from alkyl
halides or ethers/epoxides. The radical intermediates will be intercepted and functionalized by co-catalysts that
exclusively (i) activate aryl chlorides and ethers to form alkyl arenes, (ii) mediate C–N coupling from high-valent
complexes to form amines, or (iii) utilize chiral nonracemic ligands to enable enantioselective C–C/N coupling.
Goal 2. to develop C(sp3)–H bond alkylation/arylation and amination: Aliphatic C–H bond activation will be
accomplished via directed H-atom abstraction (HAA) from a tethered aryl radical. Aryl radicals will be generated
by electroreduction of Ni(II)aryl intermediates to form low-valent organonickel(I) complexes that are susceptible
to Ni–C bond homolysis. Radical relay by HAA from the aryl directing group to the alkyl side-chain provides
access to an activated aliphatic site for C–X coupling.
Goal 3. to develop decarboxylative functionalization of carboxylic acids: The first of two complementary
approaches will investigate pulsed-electrolysis techniques to enable decarboxylation at potentials that are mild
and compatible with catalysts for selective C-C/N/X of the resulting alkyl radicals. A second approach will utilize
electrocatalysts that are photoactive upon oxidation at mild potentials. Photoexcitation of the oxidized species
will transiently generate a high energy oxidant that can effect oxidative decarboxylation to form alkyl radicals."
10887655,"Women of advanced age (> 35 years of age) are at significantly higher risk for adverse outcomes during
childbirth, compared to younger women. This problem is both critical and growing, as the number of births
occurring in this age group have increased nine-fold over the last 40 years, escalating maternal morbidity and
mortality in the US. Given that prolonged labor, Cesarean birth and postpartum hemorrhage are more common
among older women, a decline in uterine function (contractility) with advancing age may be a source of labor-
related dysfunction. Prior studies have shown that individuals’ biological ages often differ from chronological
(i.e. actual) ages, raising the possibility that biological age could be a better predictor of age-related perinatal
morbidity. A robust method of calculating biological age is the Epigenetic Clock, which determines an
individual’s Epigenetic Age based on their specific DNA methylation patterns (common epigenetic
modifications). Epigenetic Age has been shown to better predict morbidity or mortality over chronological age
and epigenetic aging is also associated with social adversity and stress exposure. Given that social and
economic stressors contribute to poor maternal outcomes (as evidenced by maternal health disparities), it is
possible that epigenetic age is also a key mediator of birth related morbidity. Therefore, I will test the central
hypothesis that epigenetic age will predict impaired uterine function more accurately than maternal
chronological age (years) and that greater epigenetic age is associated with higher indices of psychosocial/
socioeconomic stressors during pregnancy. The career development goal of this application is to gain
proficiency in genome wide epigenetic methods and epigenetic clock specifically in addition to expanding my
training to include health disparities research methods. In this proposal, I seek to integrate these scientific
fields and advance knowledge of the role of the environment on maternal health and morbidity related to
childbirth and uterine function. In the first aim, using bio-banked tissues, I will apply Epigenetic Clock methods
to extracted DNA from maternal uterine and blood samples to compare epigenetic age across tissue types and
correlate with uterine mRNA for proteins responsible for uterine contractility and function during labor. In the
second aim, I will use banked data and tissue from a large nationally representative sample of young (18-25
yo) and advanced age women (>35 yo). I will apply the Epigenetic Clock method to these DNA samples to 1)
understand the relationship between phenotypes of socioeconomic and psychosocial stress (using mixture
modeling) and epigenetic age in maternal blood and 2) examine the role of epigenetic age and uterine
dysfunction during labor leading to greater maternal morbidity (prolonged labor leading to cesarean delivery,
failed induction or postpartum hemorrhage). Finally, I will explore how maternal epigenetic age relates to
infants’ gestational age and his/her own epigenetic age. Together, this study will advance our knowledge of
how epigenetic aging can influence perinatal morbidity in the context of the maternal environment."
10887656,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chloride is the most abundant free anion in animal cells. Chloride channels play a wide range of functions
including cell volume regulation, fluid secretion, regulation of excitability, and acidification of intracellular
organelles. Their physiological role is impressively illustrated by many genetic diseases involving chloride
dysregulation, such as cystic fibrosis, myotonia, and epilepsy. However, despite recent progress, chloride
channels have long suffered as poor cousins in the aristocratic family of ion channels. For decades, the field has
been dominated by sodium, potassium and calcium channels. Indeed, there are still many electrophysiologically
well-characterized chloride channels without molecular identity. This gap makes it impossible to elucidate their
precise function and how their dysfunction leads to disease. In the previous R35 MIRA ESI funding period, we
performed an unbiased RNAi screen and identified PAC, a novel membrane protein with no sequence similarity
to other ion channels, as the long sought-after acid or proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel. By mediating
chloride influx and subsequent cell swelling, PAC currents have been implicated in acid-induced cell injury. We
generated PAC knockout mice and demonstrated that PAC plays a key role in acid-induced cell death in vitro
and ischemic brain injury in vivo. Thus, PAC is a potential drug target for stroke and other acidosis-associated
diseases. By combining mutagenesis, patch-clamp recording, and cryo-EM, we revealed for the first time the
trimeric assembly, ion conducting pathway, the basis of anion selectivity, pH-dependent conformational change,
and pH-sensing mechanism of this new channel. Discovery of a novel channel represents a breakthrough that
opens up a new field. In the next 5 years, we will focus on the diverse regulatory mechanisms of the PAC channel
and its surprising physiological function in vesicular acidification that we have recently discovered. The long-term
goal of this MIRA program is to apply a multi-disciplinary approach including high-throughput functional
genomics, patch-clamp electrophysiology, structural biology, imaging, and mouse genetics to the underexplored
area of chloride channel biology."

The Behavioral Neuroscience (BN) Core will support the overarching goals of the Cognitive and
Neurobiological Approaches to Plasticity (CNAP) Center through the provision of resources, equipment, and
technical support to enhance the research capabilities of CNAP primary projects and programs. The BN Core,
housed within the Department of Psychological Sciences at Kansas State University, is the only dedicated BN
core in Psychology in the state of Kansas. In Phase 2, the BN Core facility will be modernized and augmented
through the addition of major equipment items to expand the capabilities of the facility and provide additional
technical support. The BN Core will directly support two of the proposed Phase 2 primary projects (Diehl and
Hall), the pilot grant and Scientific Exchange Network (SEN) programs, and the current community of users in
the behavioral neuroscience program. The proposed modernization of the facility will promote the growth of
behavioral neuroscience into exciting and innovative research areas that incorporate state-of-the-art
techniques that will improve the research infrastructure for animal neuroscience research at K-State. Upgrades
will allow the BN Core to introduce extracellular electrophysiological recordings coupled with optogenetics into
research programs and will increase support for a range of biochemical assays, fluorescence microscopy, and
Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). The expansion of core facilities will
also support CNAP programs by providing an excellent training environment for SEN partners. The Core
Director and Core Technician will supply expertise in neuroscience and behavioral techniques to CNAP
members with laboratories housed outside of the core facility. The comprehensive goal of the BN Core is to

10888173,"PROJECT SUMMARY: NEUROINFORMATICS CORE
The Neuroinformatics (NI) Core was established at Kansas State University (K-State) with Phase 1 COBRE
funding to support the primary projects, programs, and cores across CNAP. In Phase 2, the NI Core will
extend our skills in systems, workflow design, and high-performance computing (HPC) to include deep
expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) models, adding two faculty advisors and two
graduate students to the core. The NI Core provides secure, fast, and efficient access for data sharing,
analytics, computational modeling, and HPC. This core is particularly important for supporting the
management, analysis, and modeling of large data sets collected in neuroscience studies such as
neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging), neural recordings
(electroencephalography, electrophysiology), auditory learning, transgenic Alzheimer’s Disease modeling, and
other quantitative behavioral measurements that are often conducted in real-time. During Phase 2, the NI Core
will add support for on-premises and cloud-based sensitive data and analysis in partnership with the K-State
Chief Information Security Officer and the Research Information Security Enclave (RISE). RISE is a cloud-
based system that uses Microsoft Azure cloud to meet the appropriate standards for sponsored-research
efforts. The NI Core is an established core facility that will support all three primary projects, the two other
research cores, and all CNAP programs. NI Core access will be available to all primary and affiliated members
of CNAP. The provision of HPC and data storage capabilities will continue to promote our ability to attract top
researchers (e.g., new faculty at K-State, pilot grant leaders, and additional researchers who will benefit from
CNAP resources). Neuroscience researchers are becoming increasingly reliant on tools for working with large
data sets and the effective application of machine learning techniques. The NI Core will supply excellent
support for executing modern neuroscience techniques that generate, analyze, and distribute large data sets,
removing a barrier to CNAP faculty and researchers whose research relies on these techniques currently, or
those whose research will do so in the future. Increased tools and staff resources will continue to support
extramural funding success across the cores and programs and promote graduation of junior investigators to
independent status. This core will continue to directly support the other two CNAP core facilities and will
provide an excellent resource for developing new collaborations with Scientific Exchange Network partner
institutions and supporting training opportunities for acquiring new machine learning and data analytic
techniques. The overarching goal of the NI Core is to promote the ability of CNAP researchers to compete for
extramural funding by incorporating cutting-edge technologies, such as ML/AI, that are needed to answer the
most challenging questions facing modern neuroscience researchers."

This K01 proposes interdisciplinary mentoring and targeted career development activities customized to
ensure my successful transition from conducting mentored, basic social science research to independent
research in the area of technological interventions research. Specifically,the candidate (Dr. Jess Francis)
proposes to conduct feasibility and acceptability studies for a virtual rality (VR) intervention to reduce the risk of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) among older adults who live alone. The candidate’s future
career goal is to is to become an independent researcher conducting research in the areas of a) technological
interventions and b) improving cognitive health of older adults. Career Development/Training Aims: To
accomplish these goals the candidate needs training in: a) understanding the foundations and principles in VR
desigh; b) assessment in cognition and cognitive neuroscience; and c) design and implementation of VR-
based interventions.Training Environment: The candidate’s home base is in the world’s largest academically-
based social science institute. The resources available to the candidate at the Institute for Social Research as
well as the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research offer an environment of unparalleled research
support. Research Aims: Nearly one-third of older adults (age 65+) in the United States are aging alone. Those
who experience social isolation are significantly more likely to develop ADRD. VR is gaining recognition as a
means to promote cognitive health as well as a means to connect with our social network. There is a need to
understand the capabilities of VR to address cognitive health through the pathway of social connection among
older adult. Aim 1) Conduct a series of semi-structured interviews to understand the social convoys and
primary uses of technology for older adults living alone and identify perceptions and needs related to VR,
cognitive health, independent living. Aim 2) Conduct a series of feasibility and acceptability observational
studies using VR headset technology on social, physical, and cognitive outcomes. To achieve this aim we will
conduct a series of feasibility and acceptability of methods, protocol, and logistical issues related to social
head-mounted VR use to mitigate social isolation and promote cognitive health. Aim 3) Post-test semi-
structured interviews to promote co-creation of protocol and informational materials for the implementation of
Social VR technology for older adults’ cognitive health. Impact: The short tearm impact of this research will be
to collect feasibility and acceptability data to inform the submission of an NIH R21 to collect pilot data and
eventually an NIH R01 to test the efficacy and effectiveness of a social VR-based intervention to promote
cognitive health among older adults living alone. The long-term impact of this research will be to develop novel
and innovative interventions to reduce the incidence of ADRD and promote independent living through VR
enabled social interaction among older adults living alone."
10889190,"Project Summary
 Odorant receptor (OR) genes exhibit an unusual form of random monoallelic expression, commonly
referred to as monogenic or singular expression. In the mouse, olfactory sensory neurons express one allele
of one OR gene from a large repertoire of >1,000 genes scattered throughout the genome. Current models for
OR choice involve epigenetic mechanisms orchestrated by a genome-wide network of distributed enhancers.
The Trace Amine Associated Receptors (TAARs) constitute a small olfactory receptor gene family that is also
subject to singular expression. However, the epigenetic properties of TAARs differ from ORs in a number of
key ways, calling into question whether both share a common mechanism of singular expression.
 The goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms of singular expression of TAAR genes. We
have identified the local enhancers that govern TAAR gene expression and will exploit this knowledge to test
hypotheses about how these regulator elements orchestrate choice. The Aims of the proposal are to 1)
identify the sequence motifs that are required for enhancer function, 2) elucidate the specificity and spatial
extent of enhancer function, and 3) characterize the three-dimensional interaction landscape of the TAAR gene
cluster. These experiments exploit unique aspects of the TAAR cluster to test and extend current models of
monoallelic expression—a phenomenon that plays a critical role in myriad biological processes including
dosage compensation, cell-type specification, phenotypic variation and disease pathogenesis."

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), Missouri State Public Health
Laboratory (MSPHL) proposes to support the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring
System (NARMS) Retail Meat Surveillance Program by continuing its current sampling of retail
meats and testing for Salmonella and Campylobacter, Enterococcus, Aeromonas, Vibrio and
other lactose positive bacteria. Sampling and testing will be performed as directed in the
NARMS Retail Meat Surveillance Laboratory Protocol, including Whole Genome Sequencing and
uploading of the data. Specifically, enhanced sampling consisting of eighty retail meat samples
will be collected in the mid-Missouri area and tested monthly. The MSPHL will ship all isolates
to the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) monthly, and perform monthly sample and
testing data exchange with NARMS using the electronic log sheets provided by NARMS. Data
will be shared with Missouri DHSS and local public health epidemiology programs. Outcomes
include the testing of 960 retail meat samples annually, which will lead to increased numbers of
isolates submitted; improved data quality, sample diversity and timeliness of isolate and data
submissions. In addition, the sharing and review of testing and antimicrobial data will be used
by epidemiology programs to detect food borne disease outbreaks and coordinate
investigations; educate DHSS administrators, local public health officials and the general public
on current and emerging health hazards; support food safety program awareness of
antimicrobial resistance among the public; analyze for trends to inform DHSS management and
assist with policy development; and data will be used by the laboratory to assess accuracy of
testing results and quality assurance practices.

10900673,"CCSG COMPONENT 003 – CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) Clinical and Protocol Data Management team (CPDM), known
internally as the VICC Clinical Trials Office (CTO), provides investigators conducting translational and clinical
investigators with the infrastructure necessary to conduct scientifically meritorious research on a local and
national level. CPDM services are available to all Vanderbilt investigators conducting cancer-relevant trials. The
CTO is operationally organized by Disease Team (DT) and provides regulatory and data management services,
research nursing support, as well as contract and budget negotiation, quality assurance, data and safety
monitoring and multi-center investigator-initiated trial (IIT) development programs. VICC places the highest
priority on the safety of patients participating in research trials and continually strives to foster and maintain the
highest level of oversight and compliance across the clinical and research enterprise. As a result of this long-
standing commitment to research excellence, every interventional trial conducted at VICC must include a plan
for data and safety monitoring. The NCI-approved VICC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), was revised
and approved by the NCI in 2019. The plan outlines that while each PI is responsible for day to day oversight of
their protocol, the initial scientific review conducted by the VICC SRC includes the assignment of a more detailed,
protocol-specific plan for DSMC oversight based on the DSMP. Per the plan, the DSMC is independent of the
SRC and has the right to modify the SRC recommendations within the parameters of the DSMP. Since the last
reporting period, the CTO has made continuous process improvements and expansions within several service
lines to adapt to the increasing complexity of cancer trials while developing new workflows to capitalize on
opportunities provided by the Epic transition. The results of these changes are anticipated to reduce trial opening
times and improve ability of investigators to meet accrual goals moving forward. During the project period, the
total number of protocols managed by the CTO has increased by 27%. Among the trials conducted at VICC in
CY18, 118 of the 452 (26%) protocols open to accrual were were initiated or significantly influenced by VICC
investigators, even when sponsored by industry partners. Importantly, VICC investigators have enrolled 492
patients to National Group studies during the project period. VICC is committed to providing or supporting
excellent care and access to trials for the catchment area and ensuring the appropriate representation of women,
minorities and children as well as offer the mix of trial targeting underserved populations in the catchment area
including Blacks and Latinos and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The CTO will continue to
respond to and support the needs of its investigators by adapting its processes and workflows as the landscape
of research advances, and remains committed to cancer prevention and improving outcomes for cancer patients."
10900675,"CCSG COMPONENT 004 – PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
PROTOCOL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) ensures that all cancer-relevant interventional trials conducted under
the auspices of Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) are of the highest scientific quality, follow responsible
conduct of research principles, and have significant potential impact for patients. In addition, there is an
intentional focus to develop a portfolio of interventional trials that meet the needs of the catchment area and
assure diversity of participants, and inclusion across the lifespan. Protocols requiring full committee review are
evaluated for appropriate scientific rationale, clearly defined specific aims, achievable study endpoints, research
integrity, a plausible biostatistical plan, feasibility, and a well-justified ability to accrue eligible patients from the
VICC catchment area. These criteria exist to ensure that the study design supports the completion of its scientific
goals. This focus on the scientific integrity of the trial clearly sets the SRC's role apart from the Vanderbilt
Institutional Review Board (IRB), in that the SRC is focused on sound science with potential of translation to
cancer care, while the IRB is primarily concerned with patient safety. The SRC and IRB have two separate
functions and yet both complement each other by ensuring the integrity of the study through a sound scientific
approach while also considering the protection of all participants. The IRB does not play a role in determining
the extent of Cancer Center support that a protocol should receive. However, the SRC is responsible for
prioritizing each protocol and providing recommendations regarding Cancer Center support, which includes CTO
work queue management and financial support for institutional trials or those not fully funded by an extramural
sponsor.
In addition to ensuring a high level of scientific merit and appropriate prioritization of VICC interventional trials,
the SRC oversees the progress of all active interventional protocols by routinely monitoring the patient accrual
and closing studies that do not demonstrate scientific progress and adequate accrual. Low accruing studies
involving rare diseases and studies that advance key areas of focus and align with the Cancer Center's strategic
plans will be given special consideration. The SRC will also review any protocol changes that have a significant
impact on the design or scientific rationale for an ongoing interventional trial. The SRC also reviews trials to
ensure that they are consistent with VICC's commitment to addressing health disparities in clinical trial
participation. The SRC provides special attention to trials targeting cancers that disproportionately affect minority
populations."
10900677,"CCSG COMPONENT 005 – COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is located in a region with some of the highest cancer incidence and
mortality rates in the US. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center serving both adult and
pediatric populations in Tennessee (TN), VICC encompasses a geographically wide and demographically
diverse catchment area of 123 counties across TN, western Kentucky (KY), and northern Alabama (AL) from
which 90% of VICC cancer patients currently are drawn. Seventy of the 123 counties (57%) are classified as
rural, in which 25% of the catchment area population lives. VICC Community Outreach and Engagement (COE),
under the leadership of Associate Director Pamela Hull, PhD (CO), integrates with VICC Research Programs
and administrative initiatives to reduce the cancer burden and disparities within the catchment area and beyond.
In a bi-directional manner, leveraging relationships with patients and community stakeholders, COE obtains input
from the community on priorities for research, cancer control and care and works with VICC research programs
and community partners to bring those prioritized initiatives out to the community. The specific aims of COE are
to: 1) Assess and prioritize cancer-related needs and opportunities in the catchment area; 2) Inform and facilitate
programmatic research that is responsive to identified cancer-related needs and community-driven priorities;
and 3) Promote the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based cancer prevention, control and care.
Community-driven priorities identified through COE include cancer prevention initiatives, improved access to
care through technology, holistic treatment and support, implementation of evidence-based practice and policy,
advancing discoveries, and research advocacy. VICC conducts basic, clinical and population science research
that addresses catchment area needs and aligns with these community-driven priorities. COE staff collaborate
with partners to meet evolving community-identified needs through a variety of collaborative community outreach
activities. Working together with partners and stakeholders, VICC community-informed research and cancer
control activities synergistically contribute to empowering healthy and cancer literate communities in our
catchment area and beyond. The impact of these efforts is already evident in improved practices at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (VUMC) and affiliated sites, including newly available tobacco screening/counseling,
enhanced patient navigation, expanded reach of lung cancer screening and improved adherence to breast,
colorectal and cervical cancer screening guidelines, HPV vaccination and inherited cancer screening. Moving
forward, focus will be placed on metrics of increased accruals to research studies; improvements in cancer-
related knowledge, attitudes and behavior; and expanded implementation of evidence-based guidelines and
health policies. Together with community partners, VICC positively impacts the catchment area by enabling a
systems approach to cancer, advancing fundamental research and translating discoveries from the bench to the
clinic, community and population in the catchment area, nationally, and globally."
10900744,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Increasing data suggest that phenotypic and transcriptional plasticity are important features that contribute to
metastatic progression, tropism, and response to therapy of cancer cells. We and others have provided
compelling evidence that intratumoral heterogeneity exists in primary melanomas, suggesting it is an early
feature important for tumorigenesis. Further, recent reports demonstrate that melanoma cells can switch
between phenotypic states, some of which are associated with more aggressive biology, implicating
transcriptional plasticity in this phenotypic variation. However, the evolution of tumor cell intrinsic features
associated with melanoma progression remains largely uncharacterized. The studies that have evaluated
transcriptomic and epigenetic features involved in melanoma metastasis have typically focused on individual
molecular features restricted to a specific cell population, and have fallen short of integrating the metastatic
process as a whole. We hypothesize that emergence of transcriptional heterogeneity that gives rise to distinct
cell states in primary cutaneous melanoma is a critical step driving early metastatic dissemination, and that cells
with a specific transcriptional program harbor the bulk of metastatic potential. The goal of Project 1 is to
investigate the timing and function of molecular drivers of metastasis, the emergence and evolution of
transcriptional heterogeneity and metastatic trajectories of cell states. We will do this in novel genetically
engineered mouse models that reflect human disease as well as in clinically annotated patient samples. Using
an innovative approach that integrates genetic bar coding, single cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics,
and highly-multiplexed immunohistochemistry, we will assess the presence of specific transcriptional cell states
within murine and human primary melanomas, and assess their influence on metastatic potential using animal
models and statistical correlates to known patient outcomes (Aim 1). We will then study the mechanisms driving
these transcriptional cell states by testing the contribution of individual candidate genes to their emergence and
maintenance and their impact on metastatic potential (Aim 2).
This research project will leverage the pathological, technological, and analytical resources of Cores B and C.
Integration with Projects 2 and 3 will dissect the evolving, bidirectional crosstalk between melanoma cells and
their microenvironment that culminates in a metastasizing tumor. Understanding the contribution of specific cell
states and the molecular programs underlying early dissemination can improve our ability to subclassify patients
diagnosed with primary melanoma by their risk of metastasis and identify those patients who could benefit most
from increased surveillance or adjuvant therapies. Our studies might also provide a rationale for novel
therapeutic approaches to prevent or target metastasis. Finally, findings from this research may apply to other
tumor types wherein early dissemination results on increased metastatic potential and worse outcomes."
10900747,"PROJECT 2 – SUMMARY
Metastasis initiates early in melanoma, and coincides with phenotypic and functional changes in tumor cells,
surrounding stromal cells, and extracellular matrix components. Amongst the stromal cell types, cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are emerging as a particularly relevant cell population. Although they are
genetically stable, CAFs are phenotypically and functionally diverse and distinct subsets of CAFs were found to
support or inhibit cancerous growth in pancreatic cancer models. Although these findings suggest functionally
diverse sets of CAFs could also exist in other cancers, they have yet to be defined in most other cancer types.
Furthermore, because specific CAFs might be valuable prognostic markers or therapeutic targets, it is becoming
increasingly important to better understand their development and regulation. Here, we propose to investigate
how signals between melanoma cells and fibroblasts create heterogeneity within tumors and how this
heterogeneity unleashes metastatic behaviors in a subset of melanoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we
developed genetically engineered congenic mouse models that allow us to genetically manipulate melanocyte
stem cells to initiate tumors that faithfully recapitulate the pathology of human melanoma and to independently
inhibit specific genes in melanoma cells or CAFs. These models will uniquely enable us to investigate how
specific signaling mechanisms influence CAF functions in melanoma development and metastasis. We propose
to couple our mouse models with single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq
approaches to transcriptionally define distinctive CAF states. We will also use them along with melanoma
specimens from patients with and without metastatic progression to map specific CAFs and their proximity to
other cell types with highly multiplexed immuno-histochemistry (Aim 1). Next, we will use these tools and data to
discover cell state specific receptor-ligand interactions and study how IGF1-IGF1R signaling between melanoma
cells and CAFs –one model pathway our preliminary studies identified – influences intratumor heterogeneity and
metastatic progression in vivo (Aim 2).
 Project 2 will leverage the pathological, technological, and analytical resources of Cores B and C. It will
synergize with Project 1 to determine whether and how melanoma cells interact with distinctive CAFs and how
these interactions allow for metastatic dissemination. Project 2 will also enhance Project 3 by shedding new light
onto CAF-secreted cytokines that modulate tumor draining lymph nodes and make immune cells tolerant to
metastasizing melanoma cells. Once we understand these processes on a molecular level and link them to
clinical characteristics, we can begin to inform patient selection for adjuvant therapy in early-stage melanoma
and catalyze a rational development of targeted therapies that prevent or treat metastatic dissemination in early-
stage melanoma and other cancer types."
10900749,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Cancers commonly spread from their primary site and colonize regional lymph nodes (LNs), representing a
hallmark of progression and a key parameter for staging. The prognostic impact of LN metastasis and utility of
complete LN dissection in patients with micrometastatic LN disease, however, varies between solid tumor types
and patient subsets. The clinical observation that removal of micrometastatic LN disease does not by definition
improve survival has highlighted a gap in our understanding of regional LN metastasis and calls into question
the simple model of sequential metastasis. Given that LNs are both an early site of metastasis and immunological
organs, the interplay between dissemination and immunity may be critical to understanding how LNs impact
outcome. Here we will investigate the biology of tumor-draining LNs to ask whether regional draining LNs act as
an educational site that ultimately shifts the systemic macroenvironment to favor distant tumor outgrowth.
In this proposal we test the hypothesis that sentinel LNs undergo a cascade of cellular and molecular events
that prime the host to be receptive to tumor progression. To test this hypothesis, we will build an unbiased,
temporally, and spatially resolved map of regional draining LNs. This will enable us to identify clinically relevant
mechanisms that determine outcome by integrating a deep, mechanistic understanding of lymphatic and LN
biology together with high-dimensional imaging and novel, computational tools in mice and humans. To build
this map, we will leverage fresh frozen LNs from surgical cases, archived, FFPE matched primary and metastasis
pairs, and a clinically relevant mouse model, and determine the early changes that support tumor cell seeding
and the melanoma cell states that first arrive in LNs (Aim 1). We will further test causal programs, including type
I interferon signaling, that may functionally initiate this tumor permissive state and install local mechanisms of
adaptive immune suppression that limit systemic immune surveillance and thereby distant metastasis (Aim 2).
Finally, we will leverage the extensive resource and expertise of Core B to investigate the utility of immune
markers to stratify patient risk from archived sentinel LN tissue and thereby predict recurrence in Stage II and III
melanoma patients (Aim 3). The work we propose here promises to significantly reimagine the role of the sentinel
LN in systemic melanoma progression. This conceptual shift may inform personalized strategies to manage local
disease and thereby mobilize anti-tumor immunity and systemic tumor control across solid tumor types and
identify immune-based LN features to stratify risk for recurrence in melanoma and guide clinical care.
The resources and knowledge generated through this proposal will be made publicly accessible through NYULH
MetNet Center Cores B and C, which will enable extension of these observations to other solid tumor types (e.g.
breast cancer) through the broader Metastasis Research Network and therefore enable a significantly expanded
understanding of LN metastasis and progression."

suffering from trauma, illness, or organ failure. Realizing the full benefits in tissue engineering
requires improved fundamental understanding of homeostasis, metabolism, inflammation, and
nutrient transport in engineered tissue, coupled with reliable and integrated quality control during
the manufacturing process. By virtue of being modular, portable, capable of operating in real-time
environments, as well as being amenable to non-invasive and label-free formats, a chemical
quality control based on electroanalysis offers one plausible solution to this challenge. However,
current electroanalytical devices do not allow for selective in-situ continuous chemical monitoring
and reporting of performance in engineered 3D tissue scaffolds within enclosed bioreactors.
Enabling the study of chemical processes of engineered tissue requires radically new sensing
materials with improved chemical sensitivity, selectivity, chemical stability capable of
straightforward integration with 3D tissue scaffolds.
 The overarching goal of this research is to develop conductive metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as multifunctional sensing materials with broad
potential utility in electroanalysis. The proposed technological approach to chemical detection
offers unprecedented ability to generate atomically-precise electronic materials and devices with
chemically-tunable electroanalytical performance. This MIRA application leverages bottom-up
synthesis and self-assembly to develop sensitive and selective non-enzymatic porous working
electrodes for gasotransmitters (CO, NO, H2S), nutrients and metabolites (glucose and lactate),
and neurochemicals (ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine, and serotonin).
 The research plan implements a multidisciplinary approach comprising chemical synthesis,
spectroscopic characterization, device integration, and electroanalysis to achieve three
hierarchical levels of chemical control in molecular engineering of framework materials for
chemical detection: (1) Atomic-level control of host-guest interactions through solvothermal
synthesis and self-assembly; (2) Nanoscale control through morphological tuning of surface
electrocatalysis; (3) Epitaxial control of electrochemical interfaces within solid-state, porous, and
flexible devices. Conceptual and technological advances emerging from this work will serve as a
vehicle to develop the proposed materials into novel components of future electroanalytical
devices with transformative potential in tissue engineering, biomedical analysis, and patient-
centered mobile healthcare."

Scholars Society, longitudinal grant writing studios, development of a platform for sharing successful grants, and
training in team science, communication and mentorship. 100% of graduates have remained in research careers,
83% have received subsequent extramural funding as PI, and our 45 scholars have published 733 peer-reviewed
articles. Our scholars are diverse; 53% are women and 15% are from under-represented minority or
disadvantaged backgrounds. We now propose to build upon these successes with the following objectives: 1)
Enhance and expand career development support and translational science training resources, 2)
Leverage institutional support and matching funds to expand the KL2 Program for additional
institutional K scholars, 3) Create a supportive environment for young investigators that fosters a culture
of exploration, collaboration, leadership, mentorship and entrepreneurship, 4) Improve the recruitment,
career development support, mentoring programs, and funding support for women and minority faculty,
and 5) Provide, monitor and continuously improve the structured oversight of educational and training
needs for all UCLA CTSI KL2 Scholars. The KL2 Program will select three junior faculty (e.g., assistant
professor) per year and provide three years of support at 75% effort. With institutional funds, we will supplement
the program with additional institutional career development awards for highly qualified junior faculty. The KL2
Program is actively committed to achieving equity and diversity with the long-term goal of a research workforce
that is representative of the general population. In the near term, we will continue to actively recruit and support
diverse faculty with the goal of maintaining 50% women and reaching 25% from URM/disadvantaged
backgrounds. Key outcomes for the KL2 Program will be the success rate of KL2 Scholars in obtaining grants,
number of peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, scientific impact using novel metrics, and impact
on the health of patients and the community in Los Angeles, nationally and worldwide.

10893037,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social isolation is the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others. Approximately 1 in 4 older
adults are socially isolated. Social isolation is a major public health issue and a risk factor for morbidity and
mortality comparable to smoking, hypertension, and a sedentary lifestyle. Socially isolated older adults
cost Medicare an estimated additional $6.7 billion each year. Low income older adults have two times the
odds of experiencing social isolation compared to those with higher incomes. Amidst current aging
projections and reports that the current cohort of older Americans have high debt and insufficient savings,
the demand for subsidized housing has increased. Few studies examine social isolation among low
income older adults living in subsidized housing. Despite epidemiologic evidence demonstrating the
deleterious effects of social isolation on health, gaps exist in our knowledge regarding the best solutions to
identify and address this major public health problem. This K23 proposal builds upon the candidates’ work
funded by the Grants for Early Medical/Surgical Subspecialists’ Transitioning to Aging Research
(GEMSSTAR, R03) to advance our understanding of the facilitators and barriers of social isolation among
older adults living in subsidized housing. Leveraging these insights, this K23 proposal, guided by the NIH
Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, will conduct basic research (NIH Stage 0) to
characterize social isolation and its relationship with individual and structural factors among older adults
living in subsidized housing to identify participant characteristics that will inform the development of an
intervention. These findings will inform the creation (NIH Stage 1A) and piloting (NIH Stage 1B) of a
housing-based social isolation intervention pilot. This innovative proposal employs a transdisciplinary
approach and builds the foundation for novel approaches to identify and address social isolation among
older living in subsidized housing. This proposal will support the research and career development of the
candidate, who aims to become an independent clinician investigator focused on developing and
implementing community-based interventions that improve the health of low-income older adults."
10893042,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is common (1 in 59 US children) and impairing. Yet, co-occurring
psychiatric disorders—especially depression—in ASD remain understudied, hindering clinical care. This K23
seeks to address an important gap in knowledge about the neural mechanisms underlying depressive
symptoms in ASD, which could ultimately provide a precision medicine-based approach to novel treatment
development. Our central hypothesis is that depressive symptoms in adolescents with ASD will be associated
with fronto-limbic, fronto-frontal and fronto-thalamic connectivity that, in turn, are related to underlying
differences in white matter integrity and myelination. Our central methodology is to scan n=40 children (ages
12-16) with ASD and n=40 age-matched controls without ASD. The research goals of this K23 are to: (i)
identify resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) correlates of depressive symptoms in
ASD; (ii) investigate white matter microstructural alterations linked to depressive symptoms in ASD; (iii) utilize
connectome-based approaches to explore the interaction between depressive symptoms across modalities.
My career development goals are to gain expertise in: (i) rs-fMRI (and deeper understanding of promising
circuit-based approaches to target engagement); (ii) diffusion spectrum imaging/myelin imaging; (iii) research-
grade diagnostic evaluation of ASD; (iv) characterization of mood disorders in individuals with ASD; and (v)
professional development to become an independent investigator. This proposal is significant because it will
address NIMH Strategic Plan Objective 1.3 to characterize neural circuit mechanism disruption underlying
depressive symptoms in ASD, using neuroimaging and detailed psychopathology phenotyping. This K23 is
innovative because it will be the first to use multimodal imaging methods, including rs-fMRI, diffusion spectrum
imaging, and myelin imaging, to define neural mechanisms of depressive symptoms in a sex-balanced sample
of adolescents with ASD. Leveraging vital data and career development from this K23, I will submit future
R01s as an independent investigator that focuses on: (i) deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms of
co-occurring depressive disorders (including major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder) in
individuals with ASD, and (ii) examination of how circuits change across development (expanding the age
range to early childhood and young adulthood) in individuals with ASD with or without depressive disorders."

methods, backed up by chemical transformations and X-ray crystallography [work to be performed Projects 1,
2, and the medicinal chemistry portion of Core 2 (OSU)], where necessary. In Specific Aim 3, plant, lichen, and
fungal extracts will be subjected to primary screening against a small panel of cancer cell lines at Core 1 (UIC).
The Project 1 bioassays will involve three target-based assays [viz., nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and nuclear
receptor (Rev-Erb)], and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) testing, followed by preliminary
mechanistic evaluations. Moreover, selected pure compounds will be evaluated for potential targeting to DNA
topoisomerase IIα (TOP2α), as well as testing for DNA damage, cytotoxicity, pro-oxidant activity and glutathione-level
perturbations. These assays will be available also for the testing of compounds isolated in Projects 2 and
3 and Core 2. A strong collaborations has been established to test promising compounds from Projects 1-3 at
the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, OH [NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2)-associated vestibular
schwannomas and meningiomas]. In addition, selected compounds will be submitted for formulation, stability,
solubility, metabolism and pilot pharmacokinetic studies in Core 2 (OSU), and also tested in hollow fiber and
xenograft in vivo assays in Core 1 (UIC), and in cancer-related in vitro bioassays at NCATS, NIH. Assay
refinement in Project 1 will be conducted in collaboration with the biostatistics component of Core A (OSU)."
10893308,"The overarching goal of this Program Project proposal is to discover natural products that can serve as
anticancer drug leads from diverse natural sources. Project 2, located at the College of Pharmacy, University of
Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is comprised of botanical, chemical and biological elements. The primary goals for
Project 2 are the discovery of new lead anticancer compounds from cyanobacteria and providing tropical plant
material for Project 1, housed at The Ohio State University (OSU). The underlying hypothesis for Project 2
is that the diverse natural product structures from cultured non-marine cyanobacteria and tropical plants
will be a rich source for anticancer leads. To achieve the stated goals the specific aims for Project 2 are as
follows: 1) to obtain, culture, extract, and prepare fractions of cyanobacterial strains, and to sequence
the genome of selected strains. We will obtain 100 cyanobacterial strains per year. The strain collection will
focus on samples collected in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions of the U.S. Each strain will be cultured,
extracted, fractionated, and provided for biological evaluation in the biological test systems available at Core 1
and Project 1 as well as our external providers of bioassays. As a complementary and integrated approach, we
will sequence and genome mine the genomes of 20 strains per year and strains will be selected for sequencing
based on a) promising biological activity; and b) prioritization based on chemotaxonomy or PCR screen. 2) To
isolate and determine the structures of active cyanobacterial metabolites, and to improve yields of lead
compounds. Extracts showing promising activity will be fractionated using activity-monitored fractionation to
obtain pure natural product(s). The structurally characterized, active isolates will be extensively evaluated in the
biological test systems available to the program. We will re-isolate larger amounts of any candidate compound.
In order to improve yields, when necessary, we will evaluate different cultivation conditions, and explore
heterologous expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster of lead compounds, which will serve to provide an
alternative source for production. 3) To acquire all plant materials that will be required by the proposed
Program Project. We will obtain 150 fully documented and identified plant samples per year from selected
countries of the world. The dried and milled plant material will be provided to Project 1 for further processing.
We will also re-collect plant material for larger-scale isolation of active compounds requiring more detailed
biological evaluation as needed."
10893315,"Core 1 will focus on the biological evaluation of anticancer natural products that are identified from complex
extracts, and after subsequent isolation, confirmed to be the active constituent. This strategy, called bioassay-guided
isolation, facilitates the identification of biological activity within complex mixtures from plants, fungi, and
cyanobacteria. Extracts and compounds that display cytotoxicity and modulation of autophagy will be prioritized
based on high-content phenotypic screening and the ability to inhibit 3D spheroid growth by Core 1. Hits will be
further purified by Projects 1-3 (OSU, UIC, and UNCG, respectively) and the purified fractions interrogated until
pure compounds emerge. Promising pure compounds will ultimately be evaluated in animal models to assess
efficacy and toxicity. Core 1 will work closely with Core 2, led by Dr. Fuchs, to evaluate structure-activity
relationships and to establish optimal formulation strategies and determine pharmacokinetics profiles prior to in
vivo testing in Core 1. This approach will help maximize the possibility of successful animal experiments based
on dose and route of administration. Mechanism of action studies will be conducted to find protein interacting
partners and pathways based on transcriptomics. Dr. Burdette of Core 1 and her Co-Investigator, Dr. Aldrich,
have well-established collaborations with all of the Project Leaders and this application includes preliminary data
indicating our ability to successfully integrate compounds from all of the projects and cores. In Aim 1, we will
evaluate all extracts and compounds using a cytotoxicity and autophagy high throughput screen. In Aim 2, we
will prioritize compounds using a high content molecular fingerprinting assay to evaluate whether compounds
likely have unique mechanisms of action as compared to standard chemotherapies used as controls. We will
also determine the potency of compounds against 3D spheroids, which typically helps to identify lead compounds
that have potency in vivo. The prioritized compounds will be evaluated in vivo in both a human OVCAR8-RFP
xenograft in athymic nude mice and using a newly developed syngeneic model with an intact immune system.
Finally, in vivo active compounds will be optimized in collaboration with Core 2 to develop more active synthetic
analogues and to develop photo-affinity probes and RNA sequencing for target and pathway identification.
Overall, Core 1 tests all compounds from the Projects as well as those made in Core 2 for in vitro and in vivo
activity. Data are then integrated fully with Core A for biostatistical analysis."
10893318,"The primary goal of this Program is the discovery of natural products from plants and lichens (Project 1),
cyanobacteria (Project 2), and filamentous fungi (Project 3) that will ultimately serve as anticancer drug leads.
The role of Core 2 at The Ohio State University (OSU) is to support these efforts through the development of
the most promising of these agents, accelerating their testing in in vivo biological models and increasing their
likelihood of success. To achieve this goal, Core 2 combines medicinal chemistry and pharmacokinetic studies,
two disciplines critical to the drug development process. The compounds and data generated in this Core will be
sent to Core 1, led by Dr. Joanna Burdette, to assist the in vitro studies and structure-activity relationship (SAR)
analysis for leads, determination of mechanism of action, and in vivo studies. Similarly, compounds will also be
shared with Projects 1, 2 and 3 where appropriate. With this in mind, the following are the objectives of Core 2:
(1) Synthesize sufficient quantities of selected natural products for more extensive biological evaluation, (2)
Explore structure-activity relationships (SAR) and optimize pharmacological properties of highly promising
agents through systematic modification of the natural product scaffold, (3) Support the structural assignment of
isolated natural products through chemical synthesis and/or semi-synthetic derivatization, as necessary, (4)
Develop sensitive, selective, accurate and precise analytical assays to quantify lead compounds in in vitro and
in vivo biological matrices, (5) Characterize solubility, stability and metabolic profiles of lead compounds in dosing
formulations and in vitro cell and enzyme preparations to support optimal formulation and derivatization, as
necessary, and (6) Produce pilot plasma concentration-time profiles and determine protein and blood cell binding
in mice for early estimation of pharmacokinetic properties for select compounds prior to entry into hollow fiber
assays. The studies in Specific Aim 6 will be conducted in consultation with the biostatistics group (Core A)."
10875334,"ABSTRACT
Structural racism is a fundamental cause of the persistent and pervasive racial/ethnic inequities in mortality.
Minoritized racial/ethnic groups experience structural racism via a system of mutually reinforcing institutions
that perpetuates inequities in health through policies, practices, and norms across the domains of housing,
education, employment, criminal justice, political participation, and healthcare. Yet, few studies have
investigated the contribution of mutually reinforcing institutions across multiple domains of structural racism on
inequities in mortality for multiple minoritized racial/ethnic populations. We propose to investigate the impact of
multiple domains of structural racism on racial/ethnic-specific mortality for Black (n=30,834), Hispanic/
Latino (n=43,538), Japanese American (n=45,115) and Native Hawaiian (n=8,202) adults in the Multiethnic
Cohort (MEC) Study using novel, racial/ethnic-specific composite measures of structural racism at
the geographic level of city, town, or Census designated place. The composite measure will include indicators
from multiple domains including housing, education, employment, criminal justice, political participation and
health care. Specifically we aim to examine the impact of these composite measures of structural racism on all-
cause mortality (Aim 1) and cause-specific mortality (Aim 2) for Black, Hispanic/Latino, Japanese American,
and Native Hawaiian participants in the MEC and estimate years of life lost due to structural racism. In
addition, we will use causal inference methods to investigate whether neighborhood disinvestment,
discrimination, social support, health behaviors, and comorbidities mediate the associations between structural
racism and mortality, and investigate these associations across subgroups defined by sex, life stage, and
socioeconomic status. We will seek guidance from a multidisciplinary External Advisory Board and regional
and racial/ethnic-specific Community Advisory Boards in the development of composite measures of structural
racism, interpretation of study findings, and dissemination of the study measures and results. The findings from
the proposed study will provide key evidence of the specific interacting institutions that should be targeted to
improve the lifespan for Black, Hispanic/Latino, Japanese American, and Native Hawaiian populations.
The impact of this research is high as it will have translational relevance in providing empirical evidence for
community stakeholders, policy makers, and implementation scientists to direct interventions for reducing
premature mortality specific to minoritized racial/ethnic groups."
10875384,"The goal of the ETUDES Center is to develop and test effective and sustainable methods of identifying and
intervening with youth at risk for suicidal behavior in pediatric primary care, with a special emphasis on finding
effective and acceptable approaches for Black youth and their families. The Administrative Core (AC) supports
these goals by convening a diverse, interdisciplinary team of faculty, collaborating with patient, caregiver,
provider, and policy leader stakeholders in the content, design, implementation, and interpretation of Center-
related studies, and appointing a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Scientific Advisory Board (DSMB)
to help evaluate Center progress. The AC is led by an Executive Committee (EC) consisting of key Center faculty,
family advocates, and clinical leadership of the practice networks where the Center activities will take place. A
critical component of the AC and Center’s mission is the training and support of the next generation of Early
Career Scientists (ECSs) focused on intervention research and implementation science in adolescent suicide
prevention. The AC will achieve the following Specific Aims:(1).Set scientific priorities, provide oversight of
projects, resource allocation, and ensure human subjects’ protection. The EC meets monthly to provide oversight
over Center projects and resource allocation. Scientific priorities are developed in collaboration with patient,
family, and clinical Stakeholders, and the SAB. Human Subjects’ protection is assured via training and
standardization of IRB protocols and twice-yearly review by an external DSMB.; (2).Collaborate with
stakeholders and practices in the development, implementation, and interpretation of Center studies. AC Core
faculty will collaborate with four stakeholder groups of patients, caregivers of patients, clinicians, and policy
makers. These groups will review all scientific activities and provide input about scientific priorities for the Center.
Stakeholders also hold leadership positions on the EC; (3).Fund pilot studies and innovation contests: The
Center will solicit applications for pilot funds from ECSs and host 3 innovation contests, which bring together
investigators from the Center and primary care clinicians, to facilitate collaboration and innovative solutions;
(4).Support and mentor ECSs. This application features 10 ECSs, of whom 4 are members of an under-
represented minority group, with several either leading or co-leading one of the Center projects. Each ECS has
one or more senior faculty mentors in the Center and will have a personalized mentorship and career
development plan; (5).Serve as a national resource for suicide research through collaboration and consultation,
mentorship of ECSs who are not at one of the Center sites, and through sharing our products, procedures, and
data; (6). Train pediatricians through the Pediatric Education Program (PEP), a year-long training program in
mental health skills for practicing pediatricians. At least one pediatrician per participating practice will receive
PEP and we will evaluate its impact on knowledge, attitudes, and practices.; and (7). Communicate findings
through publications and presentations, making procedures, products, and data publicly available on our website."
10875385,"The Specific Aims of the Methods Core are to support a shared infrastructure that will enable ETUDES
investigators to efficiently conduct the proposed Signature R01 which includes “Prediction and Assessment of
Risk in Teens” (PART) and “integrated Care to Help At-Risk Teens” (iCHART) RCT, and three R34 treatment
development studies described within this competitive renewal of our current P50 Center award. This Core will
also advance the development of several emerging technologies to identify youth at risk for suicide with a special
focus on engaging Black youth; advancing health equity; support and expand the number of early career
scientists (ECSs) engaged in adolescent suicide prevention research; and serve as both a local and national
resource sharing research expertise and new knowledge. The Methods Core will provide operational, analytic,
and development support to achieve these aims through: (1) Shared data management and statistical
collaboration to provide consistent and efficient support across all ETUDES Center studies; (2) Use of proven-
effective, HIPAA-compliant and scalable methods to identify and consent study patients and meet recruitment
targets without burdening busy providers and office staff; (3) Support for a centralized, well-supervised, highly
trained, and culturally-competent team of assessors who will confirm subject eligibility, administer a standardized
battery of baseline and follow-up assessments, and promote subject retention; (4) Support emerging smartphone
research methods including mobile sensing of smartphone data and an update of the psychologic autopsy for
the 21’st Century; (5) Machine learning and natural language processing of free-text unstructured electronic
health records to predict suicidal behavior; (6) Expertise in qualitative research methods and human-centered
design to engage patients, caregivers, and providers and iteratively improve our interventions and inform new
Center projects; and (7) Application of implementation science methods to ensure our predictive analytic
methods and interventions promote health equity and meet the needs of patients, caregivers, and providers in
pediatric primary care to optimize future uptake."
10875387,"Suicide rates among adolescents have increased dramatically, particularly for Black youth. The majority of
suicide decedents have their last clinical contact in primary care. Thus, PPC settings are critical for identifying
and treating suicidal youth, but there are challenges with respect to identification, intervention, and
implementation. Annual screening for depression using self-report may miss identifying many high-risk youth,
as many suicide attempters, particular Black youth, do not report ideation prior to their suicidal behavior and
suicidal crises in youth can develop quickly. A second challenge is that once high-risk youth are identified, PPC
providers lack a reliable service delivery strategy to effectively treat these youth. A third challenge is that are
many barriers for identifying or intervening with Black youth at risk for suicide. Our Signature R01 addresses
these challenges as follows: In the first component of the R01, we will develop a predictive analytic platform for
PPC based on the electronic health record (EHR), mobile sensing, ecological momentary activity (EMA)
assessments of mood and suicidal thoughts and behaviors and self-reports to identify who is at risk and when
they are at imminent risk for suicide-related events. To accomplish this, we will recruit 2000 youth from PPC,
enriched for those at high suicidal risk, and the sample will be 35% Black. These youth will be followed with
interviews and self-reports at 1, 3, and 6 months following baseline and will have 6 months of data from mobile
sensing and daily and weekly EMA. We will: (1) develop a predictive algorithm using EHR of adolescents in PPC
settings; (2) identify dynamic changes in mobile sensing and EMA measures predicting imminent risk for suicide-
related events; (3) develop a data-fusion algorithm combining mobile sensing, EMA, self-reports, and EHR to
improve prediction; and (4) test and optimize its performance among Black youth. In the 2nd component, we
will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on a subset of this cohort, namely 900 youth at high suicidal risk.
We will compare treatment as usual (TAU) to a suite of tools developed in the current project period to guide the
pediatric provider in assessing suicidal risk, making a treatment recommendation, generating a safety plan that
is loaded on the patient’s smartphone, and launching an automated texting intervention to increase treatment
engagement. Based on our previous work, we hypothesize that this combined intervention, integrated Care to
Help At-Risk Teens (iCHART) will decrease suicidal events (suicidal behavior or ideation that results in an
emergency referral) by 50%, and the effects will be mediated by increases in referrals, treatment engagement,
and safety planning. We will use implementation science methods to assess barriers, facilitators, feasibility, and
acceptability of PART predictive analytics and the iCHART intervention to inform future implementation efforts
and to promote health equity and ensure that our methods of identification and intervention will be effective and
acceptable to Black youth. This study can improve identification and monitoring of youth at risk, reduce suicidal
events, and advance health equity for Black youth."
10875389,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth, and the latest statistics indicate disproportionate risk for
suicidal behavior among Black youth.2. Unfortunately, few interventions effectively prevent youth suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Experts emphasize that ideal foci for effective STB prevention interventions are
proximal, robust and modifiable, with broad acceptability and accessibility for population-level impact. Sleep
difficulties may be a particularly promising target for youth STB prevention efforts. Studies consistently
demonstrate a direct and temporal link between sleep disturbances in adolescents and STBs and are included
among the expert consensus set of warning signs for suicide. Furthermore, gross disparities in sleep between
Black youth and their White peers (e.g., shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, more variable sleep timing),
as well as unique and specific barriers to healthy sleep for Black youth (e.g., racial discrimination) are directly
linked to elevated risk for depression and STBs. Yet, no intervention targeting sleep difficulties has been
examined among youth at-risk for STBs nor tailored to Black youth. We posit a modularized intervention that
targets a range of sleep and circadian difficulties using evidence-based principles, such as the Transdiagnostic
Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TSC), holds promise to decrease risk for STBs in depressed adolescents. To
optimize TSC acceptability, engagement, and scalability for youth at-risk for STBs, including Black youth, among
whom mental health services are more stigmatized, we will employ the health equity-informed framework, and
draw upon the expertise in implementation science and qualitative methods among our team and the larger
Center. We will apply the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) in conducting focus
groups with youth, caregivers and providers to inform TSC implementation with depressed adolescents, including
Black youth, and then evaluate these strategies through rapid iterative pilots. We will then conduct a randomized
trial of 75 at-risk youth age 12-18 (35% Black) with moderate depression and clinically significant sleep difficulties
identified in pediatric primary care via the Signature R01. Youth will be randomized using 2:1 allocation (to
maximize data on implementation) to TSC+Sleep Feedback (i.e., user-friendly graphical representations of
naturalistic objective and subjective sleep data) or Sleep Feedback Only. All participants will complete objective
ambulatory sleep assessment (via wrist-worn actigraph) and subjective daily sleep diary data (via smartphone),
and receive weekly reports summarizing their sleep (Sleep Feedback). TSC clinicians will personalize TSC
strategies through use of the adolescent’s Sleep Feedback data. We will examine TSC feasibility, acceptability
and impact on sleep; secondary outcomes include depression and STB risk, assessed at 1,3, and 6 months.
Resultant data supporting promise of TSC will inform a larger randomized trial. This intervention has the potential
to advance health equity by addressing one potential source contributing to disparities in STB in Black youth."
10901997,"Project Summary
Recent discoveries of the phase-separation abilities of several chromatin regulators have led to novel models
for chromatin organization. Directly testing the causal effects of phase-separation mechanisms requires an ability
to quantitatively tune the phase-separation ability of an endogenous chromatin regulator and simultaneously test
for gene expression and cell fate changes. For this goal, we will develop two tool kits: (1) a phase-dial to enhance
or suppress the phase-separation potential of endogenous proteins in a quantitative and controlled manner, and
(2) a robust and transferrable technological platform to correlate live imaging of phase condensates with the
profiling of gene expression at the single cell level. Utilizing these tools, we will study the regulation and impact
of heterochromatin formation and transcription activation during stem cell differentiation."
10891015,"Abstract
Infantile hemangioma (IH) is an extraordinary example of vascular overgrowth wherein vessels
form rapidly over a year, then undergo a slow spontaneous involution that leaves behind a
fibrofatty residuum. IH is common: it occurs in 5% of infants, equating to ~183,200 infants/year
in the U.S. alone. 10-15% of IH will cause complications – e.g., destroy facial structures and
impair vision, breathing and feeding depending on the location. Propranolol was discovered
serendipitously to be effective therapy for IH, yet some do not respond, regrowth occurs in
~20% of cases, and surgery is needed in 37% of patients to correct IH residua. In the current
funding cycle, we showed the non-beta blocker R+ enantiomers of propranolol and atenolol
prevent hemangioma endothelial differentiation by directly interfering with the activity of the
transcription factor SOX18 in hemangioma stem cells (HemSC). Further we showed that R+
propranolol and R+ atenolol, along with the small molecule SOX18 inhibitor Sm4, block
hemangioma vessel formation in vivo in a pre-clinical model that uses IH patient derived
HemSC. Our findings elucidate a novel etiological component of IH and also validate a
molecular target, which opens new research directions for discovery and drug repurposing.
Using R-propranolol as a molecular probe, we uncovered by transcriptional profiling of HemSC
that the most decreased biological process during HemSC endothelial differentiation is the
mevalonate pathway. From this data, we propose an entirely novel SOX18-mevalonate
pathway axis as a central regulatory process that underpins IH-vascular overgrowth. We
suggest a new conceptual framework and clinical research directions in which R+ propranolol,
R+ atenolol, statins, or tipifarnib (all mevalonate pathway blockers) have the potential to be
repurposed to prevent vascular overgrowth. This molecular strategy should reduce side effects
seen with racemic (traditional) propranolol therapy due to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade
and provide rapid clinical benefit, especially for non-responder patients. Our goals in this
renewal are to decipher how the SOX18-mevalonate pathway contributes to IH formation and
investigate the gene regulatory networks that govern the vasculogenic and adipogenic
transitions. In addition, we aim to determine whether the SOX18-mevalonate axis is an
etiological component in other vascular anomalies (VA), which could lead to repurposing these
drugs to a wide range of VA."

This proposal requests funds to support the FASEB Science Research Conference (SRC) on ""Channels and
Transporters in Immunity"" (CTI) that will be held from June 14–20, 2024 in St. Paul, MN. FASEB SRCs are
one of the leading conference series that bring together scientists from all over the world who are experts in a
specific research area to present and discuss their latest and most important research. This will be the first
FASEB SRC on this particular topic and the most significant meeting of the year on this topic. The only other
multi-day conference in the CTI field took place in 2021 and was attended by more than 150 participants, both
virtually and in person. The current FASEB conference, organized by the same team, builds on the success of
the 2021 meeting and aims at establishing a recurring venue for scientists in the fields of immunology,
physiology, biophysics, structural biology and cell biology. Effective immune responses to infection or tissue
damage rely on the ability of immune cells to rapidly respond to stimuli. Several channels and transporters
(C&Ts) have emerged to be important control switches that shape immunological and inflammatory responses
during infection, cancer and autoimmunity. Mutations in some of these channels have been linked to
immunodeficiency in rare populations of human patients. Nevertheless, we know very little about the function of
the vast majority of the hundreds of C&Ts that are expressed in immune cells. Major gaps in our current
knowledge include a mechanistic understanding of how ion fluxes regulate immune responses at the cellular and
organismal level. This is a clearly missed opportunity for our basic understanding of immunology as well as its
clinical applications. As a result, there are currently no FDA–approved drugs targeting C&Ts for immunological
disorders. Clinical areas that would benefit from a better understanding of the role of ICTs in immune cells include
asthma/allergy, autoimmune diseases, antitumor immunity and immunity to infection. The FASEB SRC on
""Channels and Transporters in Immunity"" will provide a unique and novel opportunity for scientists from different
fields that typically do not interact to discuss the latest advances in the regulation, function and physiological
roles of ICTs in innate and adaptive immunity. The purpose of this conference therefore is nothing less than to
invigorate the entire field of C&Ts in immunology and to ignite broad interest among academic labs and
pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs targeting C&Ts for the treatment of immunological diseases. The
specific aims of the symposium are to (1) Discuss cutting-edge science in the ion channel and immunology fields
and promote opportunities for new interdisciplinary collaborations; (2) Facilitate the translation of basic
knowledge into pre-clinical explorations and clinical initiatives; (3) Provide presentation, networking and career-
development opportunities for trainees including students, postdocs and junior faculty; and (4) Increase the
number of women, under-represented minorities (URMs) and disabled individuals in this field."
10891273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A number of hormones in the body follow periodic patterns, with concentrations cycling up and down every
hour or so. These cyclic patterns are important for functions including growth, reproduction, glucose control,
excitation, and rest. However, these dynamic processes are rarely reproduced in cell culture, meaning that we
often study cells out of their natural environment. Thus, the biology that we observe in the laboratory can be
incomplete or different from in our bodies. This severely handicaps our understanding of disease and our
search for effective therapies.
This project aims to build a cheap and easy to use cell culture device that reproduces the hormonal cycles
present in our bodies. Furthermore, the system monitors the response of cells to these hormonal pulses,
sampling rapidly to capture quickly changing behavior. The system is built to resemble a conventional cell
culture plate, making it familiar to all biologists. However, inside the plate are hidden pumps, channels, and
even simple computing circuits that allow culture media to be automatically cycled between different
formulations, or sampled out into collection wells.
If this project is successful, these affordable and simple to use tools will become broadly accessible to the
biomedical community, transforming the study of a number of diseases as well as the search for cures."
10897943,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Examining how behavior arises from the complex interconnected activity of the brain is a
cornerstone of neuroscience research. A recent technological advance in neurotechnology is
enabling studies where the parallel activity of thousands of neurons can be studied in rodent
brains. The Neuropixels probe, allowing 384 channels of electrophysiological data to be observed
from the brain, is now a valuable tool for next-generation experiments. One goal of this project is
to provide a commercial alternative to the Neuropixels probe and associated electronics that will
enable feature parity in recording capability, but also be usable in scientific applications currently
unaddressed by the existing Neuropixels probe. Our proposed solution is partially enabled by the
makers of the Neuropixles probes—IMEC has recently made commercially available the
electronics of the probes as a standalone 384 channel chip without the silicon electrodes
attached. By connecting this proven technology to a new type of electrode array—flexible
polyimide-based probes—we outline a strategy to offer technology with similar channel density
that is 1) is resistant to breakage upon insertion, 2) enables closely-spaced implantation sites,
and 3) has a significant reduction in glial scarring compared to silicon probes, enabling extremely
stable recordings for months. Furthermore, by coupling this probe to powerful datalogging
electronics, we will offer a way to scale channel counts to above 3000 without the need for cables
between the animal and a computer."
10896500,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cognition declines with age, and severe and prolonged use of alcohol (alcohol use disorder, AUD) could be
accelerating and worsening these aging processes. The timing and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction
correlates with the emergence of white matter loss in frontal and temporal lobes (frontotemporal intercortical
myelinated axons), suggesting that myelin deficits may underlie these cognitive changes. However, the
direct functional contribution these brain changes may (or may not) have on reduced cognitive abilities after
alcohol in aged individuals is unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. Thus, more direct empirical
testing is greatly needed. The experiments of this proposal are designed to probe the mechanistic overlap
of AUD and aging on white matter tracks by drilling down specifically on mechanisms involving myelinating
cells of the central nervous system (oligodendrocytes, OLs). We use transgenic technology and cell fate
mapping to track the birth and development of oligodendroglial populations involved in myelinating
frontotemporal axons to learn about the cellular processes that lead to impaired remyelination capacity after
alcohol exposure in older mice. We posit that in aged animals, alcohol induces delays in OL differentiation
that prevents proper myelin ensheathment of intracortical axons and advances cognitive decline. Our
experimental design tackles these research questions with precision, scaling from molecular—to
phenotypic—to behavior. Manipulating these cellular processes allows for testing the direct link between
myelin formation and cognitive functioning. Our comprehensive assessment of cognitive abilities as a
function of age and sex also fills a critical gap by dissecting differential sensitivities that are clinically
important for consideration. These essential first steps provide a solid foundation for a larger project on
aging and alcohol interactions and whether reversal is possible with therapeutic targeting of cellular
development in humans, opening new avenues for discovery of treatment strategies for alcohol and age-
related cognitive dysfunction and dementia."
10901861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with executive function (EF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)
development. However, understanding of the specific aspects of SES that influence development of EF and
the PFC remains limited. EF in early childhood is associated with initial school readiness, academic success,
and a wide range of outcomes in adulthood. Determining how early environmental experiences shape EF
development is critical to identify strategies to support the development of these skills to promote healthy
outcomes across the life span. Accelerated progress in this effort can be made only when intervention
development is informed by a principled and biologically plausible understanding of the developmental
mechanisms by which environmental experience shapes the development of the PFC and associated EF. This
proposal argues that cognitive stimulation that occurs in the context of caregiver interactions supports
development of connectivity between the ventral visual stream (VVS) and the PFC, which lays the groundwork
for the complex computations necessary for EF. The proposal will test both environmental (cognitive
stimulation) and neurodevelopmental (VVS-PFC connectivity) mechanisms explaining SES-related differences
in EF and academic achievement. Study 1 (K99 phase) uses innovative observational methods to assess the
home environment of school-attending children aged 6-7 years, cognitive and academic assessments, and
functional and structural MRI to examine whether cognitive stimulation is an environmental mechanism
explaining SES-related differences in EF (Aim 1). Study 1 will also evaluate whether early cognitive stimulation
mediates SES-related differences in structure, function, and connectivity between the VVS and PFC (Aim 2).
Study 2 (R00 phase) is a longitudinal study of children 4-5 years (Time 1) followed as they make the important
transition to school (Time 2). This study will evaluate whether structure and function of the VVS early in
development precedes and predicts structure and function of the PFC (Aim 3) using multimodal neuroimaging
techniques (functional near infrared spectroscopy, functional and structural MRI). Finally, Study 2 will test
whether cognitive stimulation explains SES-related differences in VVS and PFC structure and function and
individual differences in EF, and evaluate whether these pathways ultimately explain disparities in academic
achievement (Aim 4). The results of these studies will provide insight into the environmental and neural
mechanisms explaining SES-related differences in EF and academic achievement. These studies have the
potential to inform interventions to help close the income-achievement gap. This award will provide the
candidate, who has a strong background in cognitive neuroscience in adults, with training in developmental
methods and developmental cognitive neuroscience to facilitate her transition to an independent research
career."
10899115,"Project Summary
The proposed research will use behavioral, psychophysiological, neuroimaging, and naturalistic approaches to
understand the mechanisms underlying daily life activity participation in older adults and its linkages to
Alzheimer’s disease pathology. There is a strong foundation of research demonstrating reliable age-related
decreases in many aspects of cognitive ability that are coupled with changes in the neuromodulatory systems
that support these functions. Yet older adults also seem to experience clear shifts in motivational prioritization,
encountering increased costs associated with engagement in cognitively effortful activities. Likewise, older
adults report an overall decrease in participation in cognitively effortful activities in daily life. However,
engagement in cognitively effortful activities has been associated with the maintenance of cognitive function
and decreased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease in older adulthood, underscoring the critical need to
understand the relationship between motivation and changes to neuromodulatory systems in older adulthood,
and how these might impact older adults’ daily life engagement in cognitively effortful activities, to be able to
promote cognitive health in older adults. The current proposal provides a novel perspective on this issue, by
employing a multilevel, multimodal framework to study the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms
underlying age-related shifts in the motivation to perform cognitively effortful activities, and to directly link these
changes with daily life activity participation and Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The project directly tests the
hypothesis of age-related motivational reprioritization and its relationship to activity participation by using the
combination of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and passive sensing approaches involving repeated
sampling of older adult daily life activity participation. Further, these rich naturalistic observations of daily life
activities are coupled with PET imaging measures of catecholamine synthesis (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine)
and behavioral and psychophysiological measures of cognitive effort in older adults to test for the relationships
between cognitive effort-related motivation, neuromodulation, and daily life activities in older adults. Finally, the
project will feature the first-ever assessment of the relationship between in vivo markers of Alzheimer’s disease
pathology and daily life activity participation in older adults, using state-of-the-art tau PET and intensively
sampled daily life activity participation assessed with both EMA and cutting-edge passive sensing methods. A
key component of the project is its exploration of mobile technologies as a means to monitor older adult activity
participation during daily life, and their potential utility as a tool to enhance cognitive engagement. As such, the
proposed work represents an essential first step in developing both behavioral and biological targets for
motivational interventions that promote the maintenance of cognitive health and resilience to pathology in older
adulthood."

The objective of this application is to investigate the role of MeCP2 in the sustained
antidepressant action of ketamine. Studies from our laboratory, as well as others, demonstrate
that MeCP2 is a strong regulator of synaptic function with bidirectional changes in MeCP2
expression producing reciprocal alterations in neurotransmission. Studies have been examining
how intracellular signaling mechanisms produce the acute antidepressant action of ketamine
and transition to a sustained effect that may last over a week. This sustained ketamine effects
requires the function of Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), specifically MeCP2 Ser421
phosphorylation. We propose experiments to identify the mechanisms by which acute ketamine
administration elicits MeCP2 phosphorylation at Ser421 and how this event is required for the
sustained, but not the rapid effects of ketamine. A mechanistic understanding of the sustained
effects of ketamine, and the underlying neurobiology, provide possible avenues to prolong
antidepressant action and thus reduce the frequency of ketamine administration and potential
adverse effects."

The UCSF Biomedical Sciences (BMS) training program provides interdisciplinary training to equip diverse
students with the scientific and intellectual skills needed to rigorously address important problems in the
biomedical sciences with increasing self-efficacy and self-direction, and the adaptability and professional skills
needed to continue making contributions in their subsequent careers in the biomedical science workforce. The
BMS program’s goals are closely aligned with those of the NIGMS Molecular Medicine program area. The
program is unique among UCSF training programs, and addresses a national need for rigorous training of
scientists who are motivated and able to apply basic and translational research approaches to dissect the
mechanistic underpinnings of human disease, from molecules and single cells to tissue and organ systems.
Students emerge from the training program with reinforced scientific identity, a record of scientific achievement,
and opportunities to productively contribute to the biomedical scientific enterprise that accord with their own
interests and values. We pursue these goals through a combination of coursework, mentored research, and
other structured training activities. The BMS curriculum provides a fundamental foundation in cellular and
molecular biology, genetics and tissue and organ biology, and integrates understanding of human disease
states throughout. It provides opportunities for deep exposure to focus areas through small group discussion-
style minicourses, and includes a translational science course that incorporates discussion with clinicians and
patients. Workshops teach students to rigorously apply emerging technologies, biostatistics, and computational
approaches in research. Skills development in evaluating, proposing and communicating research is also
threaded through the first year curriculum and reinforced by laboratory training and mentorship. Career
exploration and professional development is emphasized from the beginning of the student experience and
supported by robust program and institutional resources, optional internships, and professional mentorship
from program faculty, all of whom are required to participate in a Thesis Mentor Development training program.
Selection for appointment to the training program is conducted through an application process at the beginning
of students’ second year of training. Students may also apply for new or continued support at the beginning of
their third year in the program. We anticipate supporting 12 trainees annually from the large pool of eligible

10901864,"Project Summary
Rotator cuff injuries affect 4.5 million Americans and the increase in prevalence of rotator cuff injuries correlates
with increasing age. Around 250,000 rotator cuff repairs are performed each year, equating to over three billion
dollars in economic cost. The rotator cuff is critically important in activities of daily living, and therefore damage
to the rotator cuff can limit independence and quality of life. Rotator cuff tears are commonly treated with surgical
reattachment of the tendon; however, surgery is not always advisable due to the high probability of retear. High
repair tension during reattachment surgery is not only technically challenging during repair but also is often
followed by post-surgical retear, limited functional capacity, and/or shoulder instability due to altered joint contact
forces. Thus, a method to predict repair tension could play a key role in surgical selection. Repair tension is
intraoperatively measured; therefore, it cannot inform the decision to operate. Surgeons currently must select
patients for surgical repair based on other MR imaging parameters associated with poor outcomes and more
severe injury. Following injury of the rotator cuff, the muscle-tendon unit undergoes physiological changes
including retraction, muscle atrophy, and increased intramuscular fat and fibrous tissue. However, it is unclear
whether there is a direct relationship between repair tension and the three main clinical parameters typically
used for determining surgical candidacy (intramuscular fat, muscle atrophy, and retraction). Given the financial
costs associated with surgical intervention and the physical burden experienced by patients, an improved
understanding of the factors that influence rotator cuff injury and repair tension are needed to provide a higher
level of care for surgery patients, thus positively impacting the quality of life for millions of Americans. Our overall
objective is to understand the mechanical underpinnings of rotator cuff repair to identify relationships between
physiological changes and post-surgical outcomes. This research will provide crucial information needed to
inform likelihood of surgical success and better predict surgical outcomes, thereby guiding development of a
standard of practice for rotator cuff repair surgery. The proposed research combines an experimental and
computational framework to (1) determine the relationship between rotator cuff injury-induced physiological
changes and repair tension, and (2) determine how physiological changes due to rotator cuff injury and elevated
repair tension influences post-surgical outcomes."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, partially owing to lack of effective
biomarkers and/or screening strategies. The 5-year survival of patients with localized PDAC is 39% compared
to 3% in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease, which indicates that detecting PDAC at early stage
positively impacts survival. A centrally curated/managed multi-institution biospecimen resource containing
prospectively collected, well-annotated biospecimens representing clinically relevant, diverse PDAC screening
populations is desperately needed. The overall goal of the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC)
Management and Data Coordinating Center (MDCU) is to facilitate the PCDC’s role in developing and utilizing
high quality, well annotated samples for PDAC biomarker discovery, triage, pre-validation, and validation. The
PCDC consortium is composed of multiple U01 Research Units (RU) and the MDCU, with NCI cooperation and
central biospecimen storage at the NCI Frederick Central Repository. We will leverage our expertise and
knowledge gained during the previous grant cycle to reinforce existing and new PCDC initiatives through
expanded coordination, and strengthening the infrastructure to support management of the PCDC Reference
Sets and Signature Protocols. Our Specific Aims are 1) To provide outstanding and timely administrative
coordination and logistical support for the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium. 2) To strategically plan,
coordinate and implement the development of a well-annotated, uniformly collected and managed central PCDC
biorepository and database. 3) To provide the highest quality biostatistical leadership of PCDC collaborative
experimental design, study conduct, and analysis, and to provide biostatistical consultation to PCDC RUs. The
strengths of the MDCU are the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding of PDAC provided by MDCU
personnel who will innovatively apply time tested infrastructure tools and strategies to consortium management,
and our vast experience in enhancing the scientific needs of PCDC collaborative research. Our multidisciplinary
team is committed to continue its leadership and contribution to the PCDC organization to advance the early
detection of pancreatic cancer."
10901866,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
For many psychiatric disorders, such as substance use disorder, sex is a critical biological variable and women
represent a particularly vulnerable population. For cocaine use disorder women transition to addiction faster,
take more cocaine, experience more adverse consequences, and have more difficulty remaining abstinent.
Previous research has exposed significant sex differences in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a neural circuit
critical in reward learning and motivation, and identified the gonadal hormone 17b-estradiol as a significant
contributor to this vulnerability. The mesolimbic dopamine system - which originates in the ventral tegmental
area and projects to the striatum - has been shown to be involved in the expression of sex-specific behavior
especially as it relates to cocaine reward and motivation. To understand cocaine use disorder in females we
need to understand the fundamental mechanisms by which drug responses are mediated and how this influences
the systems these drugs act on – I focus here on the dopamine system. While substantial work has focused on
sex differences in the anatomy of dopamine neurons and relative dopamine levels between males and females,
an important characteristic of dopamine release from axon terminals in the striatum is that it is rapidly modulated
by local regulatory mechanisms independent of somatic activity. The dopamine system contains a high density
of estrogen receptors (ERa, ERb, and GPER-1 subtypes) that likely serve as important substrates through which
ovarian hormones exert their influence on dopaminergic function. Indeed, there is robust dopamine system
regulation by ovarian hormones where 17β-estradiol (E2) increases dopamine cell activity and release from
dopamine terminals in the striatum. In Aim 1, I will combine analytical chemistry and optical imaging techniques
with pharmacology to isolate dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens core and characterize the role of
specific estrogen receptor subtypes in the modulation of presynaptic dopamine release. Further, previous work
from our lab has shown selective increases in cocaine-evoked dopamine release, cocaine potency, and cocaine
affinity for the dopamine transporter in estrus females (with high levels of circulating E2). In Aim 2, I will define
how direct manipulation of estrogen receptors affects dopamine transporter-mediated clearance and potency of
cocaine at terminals in the nucleus accumbens core. This work builds on the foundation set by innovators in the
field to examine the role of estrogen receptors in presynaptic dopamine dynamics, and further proposes to
investigate how these mechanisms modulate cocaine effects at the dopamine transporter. Importantly, this work
provides me with an exceptional training opportunity while simultaneously providing answers to fundamental
questions in the field, which are imperative in developing effective pharmacotherapies for cocaine use disorder.
Together, understanding the mechanisms governing dopamine regulation and drug effects on the dopamine
system is vital to our understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern neurotransmission in both sexes, as
well as evidence-based interventions for diseases that are characterized by dysregulation of this system."
10901867,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemorrhage from intra-abdominal injuries (IAI) is a leading cause of traumatic deaths in children. Several
consensus panels have placed management of injured children as a high research priority. Many children with
IAIs have subtle symptoms, making the diagnosis difficult, and missed or delayed diagnoses result in
increased morbidity. The combination of limited scientific evidence and concern over missing IAIs has resulted
in excessive use of abdominal computed tomography (CT). CT is highly accurate in diagnosing IAIs, decreases
the level of clinical monitoring required, and is an important factor in determining the need for surgical
treatment. CT scanning also presents risks to children, however, most notably radiation-induced malignancies.
Thus, compelling reasons exist to both aggressively evaluate injured children for IAIs and to limit abdominal CT
evaluation to just those at non-negligible risk. Abdominal ultrasonography can help focus patient evaluation in
just this manner by potentially decreasing abdominal CT use in low risk children. The focused assessment with
sonography for trauma (FAST) examination uses abdominal ultrasonography to detect the presence of
intraperitoneal fluid in injured patients. Use of the FAST examination has primarily evolved in injured adult
patients and two randomized controlled trials (RCT) in injured adults demonstrate that an evaluation strategy
including the FAST improves multiple aspects of patient care including safely decreasing abdominal CT use.
Limited and conflicting data, however, exist in the pediatric population on the utility of the FAST examination. A
large multicenter, observational study suggests FAST safely decreases abdominal CT use in children
considered low risk for IAI. The only RCT in children was a single center study that demonstrated FAST use
significantly decreased clinician suspicion of IAI following a negative FAST. This decrease in clinician
suspicion, however, did not translate to a decrease in CT use. The conflicting results from these studies
strongly suggest the need for a multicenter RCT powered to definitively answer this critical question. The long-
term objective of the research is to determine appropriate evaluation strategies to optimize the care of injured
children, leading to improved quality of care and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The specific aims of this
proposal are to: 1) perform a RCT of the FAST examination in injured children and compare the frequency of
abdominal CT scanning between children in the FAST and non-FAST arms; 2) identify if an evaluation strategy
including the FAST examination results in similar numbers of missed or delayed diagnosis of IAIs than a
strategy without the FAST examination; and 3) identify patient, physician, and system factors associated with
obtaining abdominal CT scans in patients considered very low risk for IAI by the clinician after a negative FAST
examination. This study will enroll a large sample size (3,180 children) at six diverse sites, and the results will
provide definitive evidence for the role of the FAST examination in children with blunt torso trauma."

10898995,"Project Summary/Abstract
Female patients have increased pain sensitivity, increased risk for developing chronic pain, and increased
risk for adverse reactions to opioids. Despite these sex differences, many preclinical pain studies focus
solely on males. I will address this gap by investigating central pain circuitry in male and female mice, and
examine the role of circuitry sex differences in driving chronic pain.
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), two structures involved in
the affective processing of pain ( ‘unpleasant’ emotional perception of pain), share reciprocal connections.
Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide released from the PB in the BNST, is also linked
with affective pain processing. The BNST is a highly sexually dimrophic brain structure; it is possible that
sex differences in chronic pain susceptibility arise due to sex differences in BNST CGRP pain circuitry.
Consistent with this, my preliminary findings in mice show that CGRP differentially alters tonic BNST
inhibition in females versus males; CGRP decreases BNST inhibitory tone in females, and increases
BNST inhibitory tone in males. CGRP may exert its sex-dependent effect through KCC, a potassium /
chloride cotransporter, thereby regulating the inhibitory potential of GABA signaling. Additionally, PB
CGRP may be acting on different BNST subpopulations between males and females, including those that
project back to the parabrachial nucleus (aversive BNSTGlut→PB and rewarding BNSTGABA→PB). Whereas
PB CGRP inputs preferentially target inhibitory BNST neurons in males, my preliminary findings suggest
excitatory BNST neurons are preferentially targeted in females. Based on these findings, my hypothesis is
that PB CGRP release exerts sex-dependent effects on BNST projection neurons, such that CGRP
potentiates KCC2 to increase inhibition of BNSTGABA→PB neurons in males, while inhibiting KCC2
to disinhibit BNSTGlut→PB neurons in females. I will test predictions that corroborate this hypothesis
with three specific aims. First, I will determine whether sex-differences in CGRP’s effect on BNST
inhibitory tone are due to modulation of KCC2. Second, I will test whether PB inputs preferentially target
BNSTGABA→PB neurons in males, and BNSTGlut→PB neurons in females. Third, I will test whether BNST
CGRP signaling is causally involved in behavioral sex differences in chronic neuropathic pain. These aims
will clarify sex-differences in BNST CGRP signaling, and its role in the affective component of pain.
This project is part of a training plan designed to equip me with skills necessary for a career as a physician
neuroscientist. I will carry out this proposal under the mentorship of my Sponsor Dr. Asaf Keller, a sensory
perception expert, and thesis committee (Table 1), experts in pain and addiction. This mentoring team will
oversee my scientific development and facilitate my progess in achieving these aims and my career goals."

improving the methods by which patients’ values are included as they consider advanced therapies. This
proposal uses Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) as a model for studying decision support for
cardiovascular disease patients generally. Candidate: Dr. Knoepke is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who is
currently an Assistant Research Professor in the Division of Cardiology at the University of Colorado School of
Medicine. He has a Masters (Washington U. in St. Louis) and PhD in social work (U. of Denver). He works

Carroll, and Laura Scherer) through the Colorado Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Group (CCOR) & the
University of Colorado’s Dissemination & Implementation Workgroup, and ACCORDS. Training/Mentors: This
award augments Dr. Knoepke’s earlier training by focusing on three areas relevant to patient values in decision
support:1) Advanced qualitative research; 2) clinician survey methodology; and 3) Dissemination &
Implementation science. Dr. Knoepke proposes intensive mentorship; coursework & workshops, and
contextual learning through the proposed research. Drs. Knoepke and Matlock have assembled a strong team
of local mentors and collaborators to guide Dr. Knoepke through the training and research activities. These
activities will enable Dr. Knoepke to innovatively develop decision support tools for real world care. Research:
There is a pressing need to improve the science of clarifying implementing the assessment of patient values as
they decide whether to accept advanced therapies. Advanced CVD patients are disproportionately offered
such therapies. As advanced age & comorbidity can reduce expected benefits, the need to include patients’
values in decisions is paramount. This study will produce information relevant to clinical practice. Aim 1 will
characterize the current state of practice in values clarification as it actually occurs between patients and care
providers when they discuss TAVR. Aim 2 will include the development and deployment of a de novo survey of
cardiology specialists, assessing design and contextual factors necessary to support dissemination of shared
decision making in TAVR. Aim 3 will pragmatically pilot adapt a decision aid for older and/or high risk TAVR
candidates (separately developed by Dr. Knoepke) to include findings from Aims 1 & 2. Summary: This

Context: Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a subset of osteoarthritis induced by traumatic injury. We study
the pathological contributions of synovium – the inner joint lining – in PTOA. Increased deposition of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins by PTOA-enhanced synovial fibroblasts (SFs) raises synovial stiffness and contributes to
an exacerbatory cycle of stromal-immune crosstalk and ECM deposition, orchestrating fibrosis. Overactive
Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling (cWnt) has emerged as a potential inducer of synovial fibrosis, but
upstream cWnt effectors are not characterized. Piezo1, a mechanosensitive membrane ion channel, is a
promising candidate for mediating cWnt signaling and concurrent fibrosis. Under mechanical stimulation
(e.g., loading), Piezo1 translocates Yap1 to the nucleus, which perturbs cWnt signaling and drives fibrosis;
however, the Piezo1-Yap1-cWnt axis and its role in promoting PTOA has not been established in SFs.
The central objective of these proposed studies is to identify the role of Piezo1 in the emergence of pathologic
SF phenotypes that interpret and drive fibrosis. The guiding hypothesis is that Piezo1 mediates cWnt signaling
and promotes the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic SF phenotypes observed in PTOA.
Specific Aims: 1) Characterize the bi-directional regulation of cWnt and Piezo1 mechanotransduction in SFs; 2)
Characterize the pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory role of Piezo1.
Research Plan: Aim 1) cWnt activation will be measured under gain and loss of Piezo1 and Yap1, followed by
evaluation of fibrosis-related and cWnt-target genes, as well as β-catenin localization to the nucleus (primary
cWnt readout). To establish a reciprocal requirement of cWnt on active Piezo1, SFs will be cultured under gain
and loss of cWnt. Bulk RNA-seq will confirm decreased Piezo1 and Yap1 transcripts, as well as identify perturbed
biological processes related to mechanosensitivity, ion channel function, and ECM remodeling. Protein
expression of Piezo1 and the functional ability of the Piezo1 channels to uptake calcium will also be evaluated.
Aim 2) We will assess pro-fibrotic SF phenotype downstream of Piezo1 with and without inhibited Yap1. A SF-
specific Piezo1 knockout mouse model (Pdgfrɑ-CreERT2;Piezo1fl/fl) will be utilized to study the differential
progression of PTOA with or without intact Piezo1, based on our multifaceted “PTOA severity assessment.” Pain
sensitization, protease production, bone remodeling, histological inflammation scoring, and IHC of fibrotic and
inflammatory indicators will be compared between WT and Piezo1 knockout mice. Single cell RNA-seq will
unbiasedly assess transcriptional changes, emergence of pro-fibrotic SFs, and inflammatory crosstalk patterns
dependent on Piezo1 in PTOA."
10902056,"PROJECT SUMMARY
My long-term career goal is to tackle neurodegeneration as an academic researcher. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (ADRD), are both fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by neuronal loss. ALS is primarily characterized by motor impairments stemming from loss of motor neurons, whereas the main symptoms of FTD include changes in personality, behavior, and language stemming from loss of cortical neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes. ALS and FTD exist on a disease spectrum, where some patients present with features of both diseases. A molecular hallmark shared by almost all ALS patients and approximately half of FTD patients is the pathological aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. It has recently been established that the solubility of TDP-43 is increased by its binding to RNA. My preliminary data utilizing in vitro aggregation assays with purified TDP-43 indicate that missense mutations in TDP-43 can alter the ability of RNA to prevent aggregation of TDP-43. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that aberrant aggregation of TDP-43 in ALS/FTD models is due to alterations in TDP-43:RNA interactions. and that directly manipulating the RNA interactions of TDP-43 can rescue disease phenotypes. The goal of this proposal is to assess if differences in the RNA interactions of TDP-43 are present in disease by 1) examining the ability of short RNAs to prevent aggregation of disease-linked TDP-43 variants in vitro and 2) determining if there are alterations in the RNAs that TDP-43 binds to in ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons versus control neurons. The proposal also aims to 3) determine if administration of short RNAs that bind TDP-43 can rescue disease phenotypes in ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons. The proposed experiments will provide critically lacking information on the interactions between TDP-43 and RNA in disease as well as strategies to target these interactions therapeutically. The proposed experiments will substantially contribute to my training, allowing me to gain expertise in new techniques such as electron microscopy, crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and sequencing data analysis. My training environment will foster success for the proposal, combining the biochemical expertise of the Shorter laboratory and the exceedingly collaborative environment at the University of Pennsylvania and within the Neuroscience Graduate Group. These studies will facilitate both my scientific and career goals by supporting my evolution into an academic researcher who develops therapeutics for patients with neurodegenerative disease."

 Pain is a serious clinical problem that affects more than 100 million Americans. The economic costs of pain have
been estimated to be more than several hundred billion dollars including healthcare costs and lost productivity. Persistent
pain may produce long-term disability and lead to precipitation of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment.
Currently used medications for chronic pain are not always effective and have limitations in terms of tolerance and abuse
liability. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets is essential to address this clinical burden. Peripheral and central
pathways that encode, transmit, and amplify or reduce pain signals have been identified, including the spinothalamic and
spinoparabrachial pathways. Plasticity of glutamatergic synapses along key nodes in the spinoparabrachial-amygdala
pathway plays an important role in pain modulation and in the transition from subacute to chronic pain. However, the
mechanisms governing the development, maintenance and plasticity of this system and their role in persistence of pain
behaviors remain poorly understood. The proposed research will advance the concept that the trans-synaptic signaling
complex centered on glutamate delta 1 receptor regulates function of synapses in the laterocapsular region of central
amygdala also known as “nociceptive amygdala” and contributes to persistent pain mechanisms. Specific Aim1 will
define the cell type- and projection-specific distribution of these receptors and their role in regulating amygdala circuitry
and nocifensive and averse-affective behavior under normal conditions. Specific Aim 2 will determine persistent/chronic
pain-related changes in glutamate delta 1 signaling using inflammatory and neuropathic pain models and test the effect of
a rescue strategy on synaptic neuroplasticity in pain models. Changes in ultrastructure of amygdala synapses in pain
models will be evaluated using 3D-electron microscopy. Specific Aim 3 will determine the effect of restoring trans-
synaptic signaling through the glutamate delta 1 receptor in mitigating nocifensive and averse-affective behaviors in pain
models. Complementary experiments will address the effect of cell-type specific manipulation of central amygdala
circuitry in mitigating pain. To accomplish these aims we will utilize a combination of brain slice electrophysiology,
behavior, chemo- and opto-genetics, confocal and electron microscopy (immuno and 3D), and genetic approaches to
determine the functional and structural mechanisms through which the glutamate delta 1 signaling complex regulates
pain-related neuroplasticity and behaviors. This project is significant because it would identify a novel brain mechanism
of pain that could be targeted for pain management. Scientific rigor of research design is established by the use of multiple
methods and approaches, replication of experiments in independent laboratories, use of validated models and reagents,
consideration of blinding, biological variables and sex in addition to other aspects of experimental design."

My long-term career goal is to become an independent scientist in an academic research institution. My research
interest focuses on investigating novel molecular mechanisms underlying immunosuppression in tumor
microenvironment to provide new therapeutic targets and approaches to improve cancer immunotherapy
treatments. The proposed studies for the K22 award will form the foundation for my future research as I transit
from a researcher to a junior faculty member.
High risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause 5% of all human cancers, including majority of cervical cancer,
anal cancer, skin cancer and a growing fraction of oropharyngeal cancer. We have used mouse papillomavirus
(MmuPV1), a virus thought to model HPV infection in laboratory mice, to study host factors that contribute to
persistent viral infection, a risk factor for tumor progression to cancer in papillomavirus-induced neoplastic
diseases. We have identified stress keratin 17 (K17) as a critical host factor exploited by MmuPV1 to establish
persistent infection. The same mechanism is used in HPV negative head and neck cancers in mice and in
humans to modulate tumor immune microenvironment and mediate resistance to immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) therapy. The goal of this proposal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying K17-mediated immune
suppression using MmuPV1 as an infection-induced neoplastic disease model. Based upon what we have
learned so far from my postdoctoral studies, we hypothesize that K17 functions through downregulating tumor
cell MHC class II expression, and polarizing macrophages in the tumor microenvironment to prevent T cell
infiltration. I propose the following aims:1) define the role of immune cell subsets, especially CXCL9-producing
macrophages, in K17-mediated immune evasion in the context of papillomavirus-induced disease; 2) determine
tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms associated with K17 expression that contribute to immune evasion.
In Aim1, I propose to test the importance of macrophages in K17-mediated immune suppression by
characterizing the macrophage subsets comprehensively through phenotyping and in vivo functional transfer
studies. In this aim, I will continue to collaborate with Dr. Huy Dinh, a computational biologist with a research
interest in tumor immunology, to systemically study other immune cell subsets and tumor-immune cell-cell
interactions that may play a role in K17-mediated immune suppression. In Aim2, I propose to study the tumor
cell intrinsic mechanisms regulated by K17 expression, with a focus on MHC class II expression. Our preliminary
data showed an inverse correlation between tumor cell K17 expression and tumor cell-intrinsic MHC class II
expression. In this aim, I will collaborate with Dr. Huy Dinh on spatial transcriptomic studies to further investigate
how MHC class II expression regulated by K17 affect immune landscape in tumors. What I learned from
proposed studies may have broad impact on many other epithelial-originated cancers where K17 is
overexpressed."

 Aging changes the adult brain both structurally and functionally. Something about these changes
promotes cognitive decline and increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease that
affects millions of Americans and is the leading cause of dementia among adults. I propose to carry out
longitudinal electrophysiology and behavioral studies to understand how age-related changes in individual
neurons and their circuits contribute to cognitive impairments in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer’s disease.
I plan to take advantage of a novel biotechnology, mesh electronics, that will overcome many previous challenges
preventing the study of aging processes of single neurons and their circuits. I will use this technology combined
with behavioral tasks in virtual reality to understand how neurons and their circuits within the hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex change with normal aging and lead to cognitive decline. Then I will perform similar studies to
understand how spatial memory and learning deficits arise in a model of early aging in Alzheimer’s disease that
expresses pathological tau, with the goal of determining if either soluble or aggregated tau leads to neuronal
dysfunction and spatial memory impairment or if they arise coincidentally. These data will be extremely valuable
for the medical community as aggregated tau is currently the target of several ongoing clinical trials. These
experiments will also establish mesh electronics as a useful tool for the study of normal and pathological aging
that could be extended to understand the onset of cognitive decline in many other model systems."

DNA is particularly vulnerable to damage during replication, and perturbation of the replisome activity leads to
the accumulation of stalled replication forks, causing DNA breakage and chromosomal abnormalities. Such
genome instability is aggravated when genome surveillance mechanisms get disrupted at replication forks,
which is known to be a key event for tumorigenesis. Hence, knowledge on the principles by which DNA
replication fork integrity is preserved is critical for understanding the molecular checkpoint that keeps genome
stable and developing strategies for the treatment of human diseases, including cancer where DNA replication
goes awry. The DNA replication fork is supported by the multi-protein replication machinery that coordinates
DNA unwinding and nascent strand synthesis, which is undertaken by the CMG helicase and DNA
polymerases. TIMELESS (TIM) and its heterodimeric partner TIPIN constitute a core scaffold of the fork
protection complex (FPC) that links the helicase-polymerase movement, thus preventing uncoupling of their
activities, which otherwise would destabilize the replisome structure and impair replication fork progression.
While its name implies a critical role in safeguarding DNA replication, the exact nature of the FPC in engaging
diverse protective functions coordinated at both active and stalled forks remains largely uncharacterized. Given
that active remodeling of stressed forks and collaboration of DNA replication and repair enzymes are
necessary for accommodating many DNA-protein transactions that stabilize and recover stalled forks, the FPC
is expected to function as a dynamic platform to coordinate DNA replication processes and adapt stress
response signaling to rescue damaged forks. We hereby propose to explicate the function of TIM in the FPC in
preserving replication fork integrity and protecting stalled forks. Guided by our extensive preliminary data
supporting its dynamic interaction with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), an emerging regulator of
DNA replication and a target of cancer therapy, we hypothesize that the intricate interplay of TIM and PARP1
constitutes a central, yet largely unexplored, mechanism to regulate DNA replication and protect stalled forks
at multiple levels, which is reinforced to counteract the fork instability of BRCA1/2-deficient cells. Using cellular,
biochemical, and genetic approaches in various engineered human cell lines, we will define the roles of the
TIM-PARP1 interaction (1) in the replisome function at active forks, focusing on Okazaki fragment processing,
(2) in the process of stalled fork protection via regulation of TIM proteolysis, and (3) in conjunction with the
BRCA1/2-dependent fork stabilization pathway. Together, our studies will reveal a new regulatory scheme for
the maintenance of DNA replication fork integrity through the collaborative action of TIM and PARP1 within the
FPC. Ultimately, such knowledge will provide valuable insight into how DNA replication becomes derailed in
human pathological conditions, which could be exploited as a potential target for therapeutic intervention."

Sleep apnea is a common chronic respiratory disease characterized by breathing difficulties during sleep.
Prevalent clinical practice to diagnose sleep apnea requires manual identification of apnea occurrences, which
is expensive and time-consuming. Recently, machine learning has attracted much attention to diagnose apnea
based on physiological signals collected via wearable devices. However, most existing studies rely on strongly
supervised learning for the detection, and fine-grained annotations are required to achieve a high level of
granularity. In practice, it is usually expensive and time-consuming to acquire a large dataset with temporally
fine-grained annotations (i.e., detecting apnea within short time epochs). Consequently, the limited availability of
fine-grained annotations hinders the wide implementation of machine learning and limits its granularity.
The ultimate goal of this research is to create a weakly-supervised machine learning framework that incorporates
annotations of different granularity levels and clinical domain knowledge for healthcare data analytics. In
particular, this study focuses on deep learning because it has shown superior performance and great potential
in aiding the analysis of clinical data. The technical objective of the proposed study is to create new deep learning
models that incorporate coarse-grained annotations and clinical knowledge for detecting apnea at a high level
of granularity based on multiple physiological signals. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows.
 Aim 1. Systematically identify and quantify the apnea-related patterns in physiological signals. The
 proposed study will numerically explore the physiological signals to elucidate the patterns related to apnea
 and other sleep disorders based on feature engineering and statistical learning techniques.
 Aim 2. Incorporate coarse-grained annotations and clinical knowledge into deep learning models for
 apnea detection. We will establish new deep learning models to integrate incomplete fine-grained
 annotations, coarse-grained annotations, and clinical knowledge for apnea detection.
 Aim 3. Develop an algorithm to adaptively acquire annotations for performance improvement. To
 further improve the performance of the deep learning model, we will develop an adaptive algorithm to
 determine whether and where to acquire more annotations from physicians and the level of granularity.
The proposed study will address the challenge of generating fine-grained predictions given incomplete or no
fine-grained annotations in computer-aided apnea detection. The proposed model will be an advancement to
robust and interpretable deep learning that incorporates coarse-grained annotations and domain knowledge.
The expected results of study will provide important insights in addressing similar challenges in other biomedical
applications, enabling novel real-world solutions such as clinical decision-making support systems, in-home
apnea monitoring, and mobile health."

In the U.S., heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million people and is one of the most common causes of
hospitalization. New technologies are needed to enable in-home monitoring to guide and treatment changes for
patients at risk of developing Acute Decompensated HF (ADHF). Early detection of decompensated HF often
relies on monitoring weight gain, but weight alone does not accurately gauge the fluid accumulation that predicts
worsening of HF. A device that can measure vital signs (including heart rates and respiratory rates), intrathoracic
fluid status (using thoracic bioimpedance), and heart rhythm, may allow for more accurate identification of the
early stages of acute decompensation in chronic HF patients. The multidisciplinary team from the University of
Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst, UMass Medical School, and the University of Connecticut proposes to develop
a novel device for in-home monitoring of HF patients who are at risk of decompensation. The central hypothesis
is that an innovative bioimpedance and electrocardiogram monitor with re-usable, non-wetted, and flexible
bioimpedance electrodes embedded in a wearable vest, used in conjunction with a smartphone and cloud server,
will continuously collect, transmit, and monitor key physiologic data. Devices running decision-support algorithms
will analyze these data to identify patients with an emergent HF decompensation that may be mitigated with
prompt medical attention. A Bioimpedance and Electrocardiogram Device (BED) attached to the back of the vest
collects 5 minutes of data once a day from the vest electrodes, calculates bioimpedance, and has fault-
tolerant assessment circuits to enable reliable data collection. Collected data consisting of heart rhythm, some
vital signs, intrathoracic fluid accumulation measurements, and information about the data reliability will be sent
to a smartphone from the BED via Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) wireless communication. This data, together
with the patient's weight, and symptoms and signs noted in the application, such as shortness of breath or lower
leg swelling, will be recorded by patients and be sent to a cloud server via 4/5G/WiFi mobile networks. These
data will be used to develop a robust clinical decision support algorithm that accurately detects early ADHF. This
project aims to: A1.1) develop a wearable vest with reusable carbon-black and polydimethylsiloxane (CB/PDMS)
electrodes that capture 3-channel bioimpedance and electrocardiogram data; A1.2) develop a BED with fault-
tolerant circuit; A1.3) develop a smartphone application, to include a machine learning algorithm that uses the
collected physiological information for autonomous early ADHF detection; A2.1) establish a cloud infrastructure
that allows for the collection of the aforementioned data from the in-home setting along with associated data
reliability monitoring; and A2.2) evaluate the performance and usability of the system in a prospectively recruited
cohort study of patients with known HF. The clinical study will target a diverse HF population that are at high risk
for ADHF. A successful project will result in the design, testing, and clinical evaluation of a prototype telehealth
monitoring system to collect real-time data about cardiac risk factors for people with HF."
10875462,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Normal aging slowly affects the brain via alterations in synaptic transmission and
plasticity through various processes including changes in dendritic spine morphologies and loss of synaptic
proteins. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorder worldwide
and is associated with reduced synaptic signaling proteins, such as presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicle-
associated proteins and postsynaptic structural and functional proteins. Converging evidence from human
clinical and postmortem studies, and preclinical work suggests that depression may accelerate brain aging, as
evidenced by neuronal atrophy, and reduced synaptic and synaptic vesicle protein densities, and vesicle
trafficking and growth, particularly in the hippocampus (HIP) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and
may thus represent a prodrome to dementia. In animal and postmortem work, changes in synaptic density
have been robustly evaluated via quantification of synaptic vesicle proteins. In vivo quantification of synaptic
density in humans was recently made possible with the development of a novel radioligand 11C-UCB-J, which
quantifies the density of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a ubiquitously expressed marker of synaptic
density, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this study, we will conduct the first known in
vivo human examination of whether MDD may accelerate synaptic aging over a 25-year span (ages 40-65), as
well as how MDD-related changes in synaptic density relate to cognitive functioning and the heterogeneous
clinical presentation of this disorder. Our preliminary data from a large normative sample of healthy adults
suggest a systematic age-related decline in synaptic density in the HIP and dlPFC, which becomes more
pronounced as a function of increasing age. They further reveal a substantially more pronounced decline in
synaptic density in the HIP and dlPFC in individuals with MDD compared to age-matched healthy controls. In
the proposed study, we will employ a novel accelerated longitudinal design that builds on these initial results by
evaluating whether MDD accelerates synaptic aging by examining in vivo changes in synaptic density in the
HIP and dlPFC compared to healthy controls across the middle-to-older age spectrum. We will also evaluate
how synaptic density in these brain regions relates to the endophenotypic and phenotypic expression of MDD
using state-of-the-art objective laboratory, structured clinical interview, and neuropsychological measures.
Results of the proposed study will provide the first human in vivo data on the role of MDD as a potential
accelerator of synaptic aging, as well as the effect of MDD-related changes in synaptic density on the clinical
expression of this multi-faceted disorder. They will also inform pathophysiologic models of how MDD
contributes to synaptic aging, and yield new insight into a novel “upstream” mechanism-based target for
therapies designed to mitigate accelerated brain aging and risk for cognitive decline and dementia."
10875465,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the sudden and unexplained death of a patient with a history of seizures
and epilepsy who is in a reasonable state of health. It is a major cause of death in patients with epilepsy and a common
cause of neurologic death overall. Believed to be caused by a culmination of cardiac and neurologic factors, epilepsy
induced bradycardia is a risk factor for SUDEP and may trigger lethal ventricular arrhythmias in susceptible myocardium.
Development of a robust experimental model which recapitulates this would open the door for foundational studies to
develop critical pharmacotherapies. SUDEP is a tragic outcome in patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC)
which is characterized by epilepsy, dystonia, paralysis, and, notably, sudden death in the setting of bradycardia. Among
AHC patients, 90% harbor underlying pathologic genetic variants in the ATP1A3-encoded alpha-3 catalytic subunit of the
Na/K ATPase pump (ATP1A3). We have identified a strong correlation between the most common AHC-associated
ATP1A3 variant (D801N) and short QT on ECG and ventricular fibrillation during bradycardia. Human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes from an ATP1A3-D801N-positive child (hiPSC-CMD801N) demonstrate shortened
repolarization time, disrupted calcium homeostasis, and delayed-after depolarizations, which are triggers for arrhythmias.
Knock-in mice hosting the D801N variant (Atp1a3D801N) have seizures, bradycardia, and sudden death. Further, Atp1a3D801N
mice have a predisposition to ventricular arrhythmias, particularly at lower heart rates, compared to controls. Collectively,
these findings raise the possibility that disruption of ATP1A3 in the heart underlies SUDEP in AHC patients through
bradycardia-triggered arrhythmias. We hypothesize that D801N reduces pump function leading to shortened repolarization
time and predisposes to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Our goal is to use AHC as a model to establish the role ATP1A3 in
the heart, determine the mechanism of SUDEP, and explore the proarrhythmic effect of bradycardia. To approach this in
an innovative and rigorous way, we will utilize patient-derived hiPSCD801N- and murine Atp1a3D801N-based models for in
vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies to determine the mechanism of arrhythmia predisposition in the heart. Specifically, we
propose to determine 1) the mechanism of action potential duration shortening induced by D801N in cardiac myocytes, 2)
the mechanism of cardiac arrhythmogenesis induced by D801N in 3D tissue models and ex vivo analysis, and 3) whether
bradycardia due to seizures is an arrhythmogenic trigger for a “vulnerable” myocardium in Atp1a3D801N mice. In
accomplishing these aims and overall goal, we will determine the function of ATP1A3 in cardiovascular physiology and its
role in cardiac repolarization, calcium signaling, and ventricular arrhythmias, thus identifying molecular targets for
pharmacotherapy. Finally, this will develop robust and rigorous models to determine the mechanisms of sudden death in
AHC and will provide insights into mechanisms of SUDEP more broadly."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by α-synuclein-rich
neuronal inclusions. Recent genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) and epidemiological studies have
identified multiple candidate genes and environmental factors, respectively, which can modify PD risk. Studying
polygenic interactions with environmental factors has been difficult due to the lack of a model system. However,
studies have hinted at a complex relationship between α-synuclein, the genetic risk factors, and environmental
factors. In our preliminary data, we have established a multiplex model using the Drosophila model of PD. In this
model, we express human α-synuclein, simultaneously modify GWAS candidate genes in neurons, and expose
adult flies to rotenone. Using a combination of scalable techniques in this model, we identified novel interactions
among α-synuclein, environmental factors, and GWAS genes. The overarching hypothesis is a multiplex
model, in combination with iPSC-derived neurons, can be used to identify and study the mechanism of
novel gene-environment interactions. Further, this model system will identify potential drug targets that
can modify the gene-environment interactions. In Aim 1, a series of experiments, including super-resolution
microscopy and iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons, will be performed to characterize the
interaction among LRRK2, rotenone, and α-synuclein, which was identified using the multiplex model. These
experiments will be performed in the laboratory of primary mentor Mel B. Feany. Aim 2 will involve understanding
the mechanism of interactions among LRRK2, rotenone, and α-synuclein. Previous studies and preliminary
experiments have shown that actin hyperstabilization plays a central role in regulating neurotoxicity. Herein
biochemical, immunohistological, and neurotoxicity assays will be performed in Drosophila and iPSC-derived TH
neurons (obtained disease-causing LRRK2-G2019S and protective LRRK2-R1398H iPSCs) to study the role of
actin dynamics in regulating this gene-environment interaction. These experiments will be performed in Dr.
Feany's lab. In the independent R00 section, a druggable target that can modify the interaction among LRRK2,
rotenone, and α-synuclein will be identified. Further, we will screen for other PD-related neurotoxicants that
interact with LRRK2 and α-synuclein through actin hyperstabilization. We will genetically and pharmacologically
inhibit MRCKα, a kinase that can regulate actin hyperstabilization, in flies, iPSC-derived neurons, and a mouse
model. My neurotoxicology and neurodegeneration training will be facilitated by didactic courses and
participation in Clinical Pathological conferences at Harvard Medical School and the Exposome boot camp at
Columbia University organized by co-mentor Gary Miller. This project may elucidate a novel model system that
can be used to identify and study the mechanism of gene-environment interactions. The training that I undertake
will enable me to transition to independence and lead a laboratory investigating the molecular mechanisms of
gene-environment interactions in neurodegenerative disorders."

Many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are late- or never diagnosed (LDx). Initial data links female
sex to LDx. Gender diversity is also overrepresented in ASD and associated with LDx. Autistic people assigned
female at birth (ASDaF) and those who are gender diverse (ASDgd) experience increased psychiatric
comorbidity, and, in the case of ASDgd, suicidality. LDx is associated with increased depression, anxiety and
self-harm and limits access to supports, increasing vulnerability to abuse. Obstacles to timely diagnosis (Dx) of
ASDaF may involve individual-level biobehavioral differences, including fewer unusual restricted/repetitive
behaviors (RRBs), and strengths in social motivation, executive function and/or intelligence. Contextual factors,
such as the predominance of young-cisgender-male conceptualizations of ASD in referral patterns and clinical
diagnosis, also play a key role. Our goal is to integrate qualitative, quantitative, and artificial intelligence methods
to identify contextual and biobehavioral predictors of LDx, leading to the development of a practicable screening
measure for those at LDx risk. To illuminate mechanisms of LDx (1st ASD Dx > 12y) we will build on three legacies
of our decade-long longitudinal ACE Network: 1) a sex-balanced, deeply phenotyped, longitudinal cohort of
autistic youth & young adults; 2) a gender characterization method validated in ASD—the Gender Self-Report
Scale (GSRS)—to quantify gender identity (binary and nonbinary) characteristics beyond assigned sex; and 3)
a collaboration with autistic co-researchers to engage community-based participants to develop a self-report
tool—the Self-Assessment of Autistic Traits (SAAT)—that captures the lived experience of ASD, including
strengths. We will recruit a sex-balanced community-based sample of autistic people (ages 16-30y) to augment
our longitudinal ACE cohort with two critical subgroups: LDx and ASDgd individuals. We will use intentional
sampling and equitable inclusion across assigned sex, gender and gender diversity, ethno-racial identity, and
LDx individuals with ASD. Using a mixed-methods approach, we will identify markers of LDx and examine the
interplay between sex and gender in Dx timing and well-being outcomes. A sex, gender, and ethnoracially diverse
stakeholder team of clinicians, self-advocates, autistic people, and parents, all with professional and/or lived
experience with LDx ASD, will guide us as we: 1. Identify sex, gender, cognitive, and behavioral differences
between timely (TDx) and LDx autistic people. 2. Develop and validate a self-report ASD screening measure as
a diagnostic access point for adolescents/adults at risk for LDx. 3. Develop a personalized approach to
biobehavioral marker extraction for classification of diagnostic timing (LDx vs. TDx) and prediction of QoL indices,
using an innovative artificial intelligence approach to integrate multimodal neuroimaging data with phenotypic
information. We will improve research and clinical practice by accelerating identification of adolescents and
adults with ASD who have traditionally been missed or misdirected in the diagnostic process. This work will
accelerate ASD Dx in the community, allowing for appropriate supports and improved outcomes."

Macromolecular Crystallography (MX) is an established and widely used method for obtaining accurate, high-
resolution 3D models of biological molecules, yet MX data contain information that has yet to be unlocked.
Single-electron changes can be clearly visible at resolutions as low as 3.5 Å if systematic errors can be
eliminated. Creating simulation technologies that can account for these errors will have significant impact on
three fronts: 1) eliminating the structural changes and other caveats of radiation damage, which ultimately
limits the amount of data available from a given sample 2) improving multi-crystal averaging and comparison
by capturing and correcting non-isomorphism, which will open the gateway to arbitrary gains in signal-to-noise,
3) discriminating hotly contested alternative interpretations such as the presence or absence of a bound ligand,
by creating simulations with more realistic solvent and protein models. To move towards damage-free data
from a synchrotron, we will start by implementing a new kind of data collection we call “painting with X-rays”
that leverages modern fast-framing detectors to combine the best features of broad-beam and micro-beam
technologies: low dose contrast and isolation of the best parts of the crystal. We will then enhance zero-dose
extrapolation to handle the rich temporal information made available by finely dividing up the available photons.
We will build on our success correcting non-isomorphism in real space into reciprocal space, enabling merging
of incomplete data such as XFEL stills into parametric structure factor frameworks. These low-dimensional
frameworks will allow selection from a continuum of 3D molecular structures by dialing in desired parameter
values, and will also be applied to cases where the parameters are known quantities, such as time-resolved,
temperature series, humidity, or other reaction coordinates and variables controlled in an experiment. We will
test these framework models against the thousands of non-isomorphous data sets that have been collected at
our beamline and report on best practice. To enable robust interpretation of experimental data, we will extend
these multi-conformer models with simulation-based solvent models. Our work will create standard protocols
for comparing solvent density to alternative interpretations and to quantitatively assess how likely each
simulated situation is compared to the real macromolecular crystallography data. In addition to distinguishing
between different interpretations of the experimental data, improving solvent models will enhance
understanding of how macromolecules influence and interact with other molecules near their surface.
Collectively, we expect the benefits of eliminating these critical systematic errors to be transformative to both
methods development and functional studies using complimentary structural techniques, such as CryoEM,
SAXS, tomography and electron diffraction, especially hybrid methods that combine structural data from
multiple sources."

10876351,"Early in development, a highly coordinated maternal-to-zygotic transition “reprograms” the embryo to a
pluripotent cellular identity, capable of giving rise to all subsequent cell types in the developing organism. How
cells are induced to pluripotency is still poorly understood, and yet has enormous implications, not only for
understanding fundamental developmental and gene regulatory processes, but also for disease modeling and
therapies. The long-term goal is to decipher mechanisms and principles conserved across vertebrates that
guide pluripotency induction. To begin to address this question, this proposal aims to elucidate how
pluripotency factors provided to the egg activate the first genes from the embryonic genome in the model
vertebrate zebrafish. Zebrafish produce large clutches of externally developing embryos and express many key
regulators of pluripotency that are conserved with humans, making them an ideal experimental system to
discover novel regulatory paradigms that induce vertebrate pluripotency. This proposal has three primary
goals. First, the regulatory logic underlying the specificity of embryonic gene activation will be deciphered.
Maternal pluripotency factors act on a transcriptionally quiescent embryonic genome to initially activate only a
few hundred genes, prior to the activation of thousands of genes hours later. Cutting-edge techniques will be
used to map pluripotency factor binding genome wide, at earlier developmental stages than have previously
been profiled. Binding patterns will be compared in the vicinity of early- versus later activated genes, and
distinguishing properties of their respective gene regulatory sequences will be extracted. Second, novel
regulators of embryonic genome activation will be deduced by integrating multiple sources of genomics data.
These factors will be evaluated using innovative loss-of-function strategies to measure their contributions to
embryonic reprogramming and pluripotency. Third, this proposal will uncover post-transcriptional mechanisms
that regulate the maternal pluripotency factors themselves. Biochemical and genetic approaches will be used
to discover factors that bind maternal mRNA to positively or negatively affect their expression, and in turn exert
precise temporal control over pluripotency induction. Together, these analyses will further elucidate the gene
regulatory logic of the early vertebrate embryo and provide a deeper understanding of how pluripotent
identities are induced."

Maintenance of genomic integrity depends on the ability of cells to repair damaged DNA and resolve
transcription-replication conflicts. In this regard, R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures that
harbor an RNA transcript hybridized to a DNA template, can compromise genome stability in multiple
ways. Specifically, the ssDNA within the R-loop structure is vulnerable to nucleolytic cleavage, resulting
in transcription-associated mutagenesis or transcription-associated recombination. Moreover, collisions
of the DNA replication machinery with R-loops can cause replication fork collapse, DNA double-strand
breaks (DSBs), fork fusions, and chromosome translocations, which can then lead to neoplastic
transformation and tumorigenesis.
This competitive continuation of our MPI grant leverages our unique expertise in DNA repair enzymology
and cell biology modeling to delineate the structure-function of an R-loop resolution machinery comprised
of the SF1 family helicase Senataxin (SETX) and the tumor suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1. In
Specific Aim 1, we will define the unusually versatile nucleic acid unwinding activity of SETX and test
the hypothesis that SETX resolves R loops directly through specific unwinding activity. Specific Aim 2
will determine the role of BRCA1-BARD1 in SETX-mediated R-loop resolution to test the hypothesis that
BRCA1-BARD1 cooperates with SETX to resolve pathological R-loops by interrogating SETX and
BRCA1-BARD1 in our reconstituted biochemical systems and in cells.
This MPI renewal is based on the longstanding and productive collaboration between Dr Patrick Sung, a
leading DNA repair enzymologist, and Dr Gary Kupfer, a physician-scientist who has utilized the genetic
model of Fanconi anemia to advance understanding of DNA repair pathways and mechanisms.
Together, with numerous coauthored papers of high significance, our continuing collaborative endeavors
promise to exert impact of the highest degree and to provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings
of a major genome maintenance pathway that is linked to tumor suppression pathways."

The application is focused on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most lethal forms of human cancer for
which the massive knowledge generated by genomic data has provided little therapeutic improvement. One key
element in the success of clinical studies for cancer patients is the selection of homogeneous groups of patients
harboring tumors that share identifiable functional vulnerabilities rather than general biomarkers. In GBM, the
lack of a functional classifier has hindered the targeting of fundamental cancer-driving mechanisms in well-
defined patient subgroups, leading to discouraging results. The proposal is founded on a novel classification of
GBM that we have recently proposed. Different from previously established marker-based classification, the new
classifier is centered on functional activities of cancer cells that we identified by single cell transcriptomic
analysis. The classifier was validated in several cohorts of bulk primary GBM and includes four subtypes, two
linked to neurodevelopmental programs, neuronal and proliferative-progenitor, and two characterized by
divergent metabolic activities, mitochondrial and glycolytic-plurimetabolic. Notably, the mitochondrial subtype is
endowed with a distinct sensitivity to oxidative phosphorylation inhibition and is associated with a better survival,
while the glycolytic-plurimetabolic subtype is characterized by redundant metabolic activities. Our preliminary
analysis revealed that each functional GBM subtype is association with biologically coherent proteomic and
phosphoproteomic features. In this application we will combine innovative computational tools and state-of-the-
art experimental models in vitro and in vivo to study the impact of functional cell states of GBM in therapy
resistance. We built the research plan with the following aims: i) examine and target the plasticity of the
neurodevelopmental glioma states under therapy pressure and the cross-talk with signals from the
microenvironment; ii) determine how mitochondrial cells adjust to therapy pressure when treated with
mitochondrial inhibitors and the mechanism of induced resistance; iii) retrieve therapeutic intervention points
from proteomic data focusing on DNA-PK and PKCd, two protein kinases active selectively in the
proliferative/progenitor and glycolytic/plurimetabolic subtypes of GBM, respectively. Experimental validations will
be applied to these nodal factors and will be performed by our laboratories, which in the course of many years
have generated and perfected the array of experimental tools including sequence-annotated patient-derived
models to pursue each question. By integrating novel computational and experimental platforms to study the
evolution of distinct GBM subtypes, the proposal is conceptually and technically innovative. The successful
outcome of this proposal will be the delivery of key information to decipher evolving tumor dependencies under
treatment and accurate therapeutic strategies specifically tailored to distinct subgroups of GBM patients."

Professor of Dermatology, Dr. Orenstein will have access to the Dermatology Center for Outcomes
Research and Safety unit and the resources and institutional capital of Emory School of Medicine.
Research: HS is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting ~0.4% of adults that causes recurrent, painful
scarring abscesses leading to poor QoL. Pain is rated by HS patients as their most important symptom, yet
little is known about its mechanisms, trajectory, best practices for measuring HS pain, or effective treatments.
Specific Aims: In a prospective cohort study, we will identify HS pain mechanisms, determine the influence of
pain mechanisms on pain interference with daily activities, establish HS pain trajectory patterns, and optimize
HS pain measurement for clinical trials. In a separate study, we will use a mixed methods design to understand
domains of suffering, unmet pain needs, and pain care preferences in HS patients and their care partners. We
will present these data to a stakeholder panel consisting of HS patients, community advocates, and clinical
experts who will use Intervention Mapping techniques to generate recommendations for designing and
evaluating complex intervention(s) that reduce pain in HS. The proposed research will provide Dr. Orenstein
with the preliminary data and training to apply for an R01 focused on HS pain mechanisms and an R21 and
subsequent R01 to develop, pilot, and evaluate complex interventions to mitigate pain and suffering in HS."

Notwithstanding a substantial effort of “getting to zero”, new HIV infections among people who inject drugs are
increasing. Methamphetamine is a primary driver of that increase, as methamphetamine use has been
extensively demonstrated to increase both sexual and injection-related HIV transmission. Methamphetamine
use is also associated with poor medication adherence, such that people with HIV who use methamphetamine
are less likely to be virally suppressed. The most powerful tool for prevention of HIV available today, in addition
to aggressive treatment of people living with HIV to ensure viral suppression, is pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) with emtricitabine plus a tenofovir product (e.g. FTC/TAF). PrEP has been extensively demonstrated to
reduce HIV infection when taken in sufficient amounts, generally defined as ≥4 doses per week. The Centers
for Disease Control and other health agencies recommend PrEP for people who inject drugs, yet there has
been precious little attention to this population in PrEP clinical trials, implementation studies, and
demonstration projects. Two major reasons for this lack of attention are (1) that syringe access programs,
where available, are powerful tools to lower HIV transmission by injection, and (2) that people who inject drugs
– and in particular people who use methamphetamine – are likely to struggle with medication adherence. In the
context of expanding methamphetamine use – as the next wave of the opioid crisis – and a national effort to
eliminate HIV transmission, syringe access programs are unlikely to be sufficient to prevent the remaining
infections that occur. In this study, “PrEP Intervention for people who Inject Methamphetamine” (PRIME), we
propose to address the second concern by testing a combined adherence intervention. PRIME is a two-arm
trial comparing standardized counseling to video directly-observed treatment with real-time contingency
management (VDOT-CM) for adherence to once-daily emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) PrEP
among people who inject methamphetamine. We will randomize 140 adults who inject methamphetamine, are
HIV-negative, and have recently engaged in HIV risk behaviors to VDOT-CM or counseling alone for 24 weeks.
Both groups will receive PrEP and counseling to support PrEP adherence; the intervention condition will also
receive a mobile phone app that video records daily PrEP use and a nominal contingency management
incentive to complete the observed PrEP dosing. We will compare adherence to PrEP in both arms by testing
dried blood spots for tenofovir disphosphate (TFV-DP) levels of ≥ 950 fmol/punch, corresponding to ≥4 doses
per week. We will assess acceptability of PrEP in this population through qualitative interviews and survey
items. Finally, we will compare injection and sexual risk behaviors prior to PrEP to those while on PrEP, to
evaluate for risk compensation. Study results will provide critical data for intensive adherence support for PrEP
among people who inject methamphetamine, a very high risk population for HIV transmission."

Although 21% of pregnant women experience perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, the burden is especially
heavy for low-income and minority women. For example, African-American women have a higher risk of
psychosocial stress (e.g., exposure to adversity, racism, and traumatic life events) throughout life than white
women. Moreover, African-American women are at significantly higher risk for maternal and neonatal adverse
events resulting from psychological distress, such as preterm birth (17% vs. 10%) and low birthweight (13%
vs. 7%). However, African-American women are the least likely group to receive mental health interventions
that could reduce these disparate outcomes. A cross-system collaboration between researchers, clinicians,
and patients is working to overcome these barriers by developing, testing, and implementing a novel model:
Elevating Voices, Addressing Depression, Toxic Stress and Equity in Group Prenatal Care (EleVATE GC).
EleVATE GC is based on group prenatal care and has embedded within it a trauma-informed, evidence-based
behavioral health intervention grounded in anti-oppressive principles. The objectives of this proposal are to
rigorously assess the effectiveness of EleVATE GC and to determine the feasibility, sustainability, and barriers
to implementing EleVATE GC in real-world care settings. These objectives will be achieved by conducting a
pragmatic effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial comparing EleVATE GC (n=563) to
individual prenatal care (n=282) for pregnant women at high risk for depression. This trial will be conducted at
eight diverse prenatal clinics in the St. Louis region that serve a population with a high preterm birth rate
(~16% vs. 11% nationally). Additionally, 80% of women served by these sites have a history of depression,
anxiety, trauma, or another mental health diagnosis. Within this trial, Aim 1 is to determine the effectiveness of
EleVATE GC to reduce perinatal depression and adverse pregnancy outcomes among low-income,
predominantly African-American women. This aim tests the hypothesis that, compared to women receiving
individual care, those in EleVATE GC will have lower perinatal depression (primary) and lower risk of preterm
birth and low birthweight infants (secondary). Aim 2 is to identify strategies and contextual implementation
factors to enhance implementation of EleVATE GC. An adaptation of the Practical Robust Implementation and
Sustainability Model will be used across three of the four domains (intervention design, recipient,
implementation and sustainability) at three levels (prenatal care clinic, clinician, and patient). This project is
directly responsive to the call of RFA-MH-20-400 to ""test the effectiveness of strategies for implementation and
sustainable delivery of evidence-based mental health treatments and services to improve mental health
outcomes for underserved populations in under-resourced settings in the United States""."

Latinos (used throughout proposal as inclusive of all genders) have become the largest ethnic minority group in
the United States but the rapid growth of the Latino US population has yet to translate into a significant
increase in Latino researchers and/or health professionals. Through the research workforce diversity objective
of the NIH research education program, R25 (PAR-19-197), the Latino-Scholars in HIV/AIDS Research
Education (SHARE) Program at The George Washington University, grounded in Social Cognitive Career
Theory and Intersectionality Framework, seeks to address both the shortage of Latino investigators in the field
and to improve the quality of Latino HIV scientists. This objective will be achieved by the following aims: Aim 1.
Develop a competency-based approach to mentoring with a triad of integrated mentors (i.e., career, science,
and peer) in HIV/SUD (Substance Use Disorder), and assess cognitive-related mediators (i.e., self-efficacy and
science identity) of mentoring effectiveness and career success. Aim 2. Implement activities for 30
participants (six undergraduate Latino participants per year over five-year project period) for mentored hands-
on research experience (prospective research study or secondary data analysis) on a high-priority focused
HIV/SUD research topic (Health inequities, social determinants of health, prevention and care continuum, and
comorbidities). Aim 3. Implement activities for educational and professional-career enrichment experiences
through didactics and professional-career enrichment seminars. For these program aims, we will evaluate the
impact and effectiveness of SHARE Program on outcomes achieved and career trajectories of the participants
and disseminate program success. Expected short term outcomes will include promoting development of a
cadre of undergraduate Latino students committed to pursuing behavioral, social and health science research
careers in HIV/SUD. The long-term outcome and impact of the program aligns with the priority of the National
Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)--to increase diversity, in number and quality, of well-trained researchers in the
behavioral and social sciences of HIV and SUD, to reduce their societal consequences and improve individual
and public health."
10877220,"Diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with various pathologies that lead to long-term impairments,
including post-traumatic headache (PTH), particularly migraine. There are worse outcomes of TBI when
compounded with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The objective of the F99 work is to elucidate the
mechanism(s) that may be attributed to TBI-induced pathologies and ICP-mediated diffuse pathologies. The
objective of the K00 is to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of migraine to become an investigator
of PTH in TBI. One pathology, neuronal membrane disruption, has been shown to be induced acutely post-TBI.
However, my initial studies present that membrane disruption in neurons can last beyond the acute timeframe
and last for weeks post-TBI. Furthermore, data indicate that there is a subpopulation of cortical neurons that do
not express NeuN and are membrane disrupted. With other injuries, a NeuN negative (NeuN-) presentation has
been indicative of a reversion to an immature neuronal phenotype. If injured neurons are reverting to an immature
phenotype, then this could be a compensatory mechanism, so identifying these neurons that also are membrane
disrupted may provide more insight into the molecular mechanism of membrane disruption. Aim 1a) is to
investigate the identity of NeuN- subpopulation of membrane disrupted neurons using intracerebroventricular
(ICV) cell impermeable fluorescently-tagged dextran tracer in sham and central fluid percussion injured (CFPI)
animals. Then using histological and molecular paradigms, I will evaluate membrane disrupted neurons for
cellular NeuN expression, and expression of immature neuronal markers. Incidentally, the mechanism behind
neuronal membrane disruption is unknown, and previous work from our lab shows that when TBI is compounded
with an elevation in ICP in rats, that neuronal membrane disruption is increased in direct relation to the ICP
elevation. Aim 1b) is to evaluate the effects of secondary ICP elevation on the NeuN- membrane disrupted
subpopulation. I propose that lysosomal Cathepsin B (Cath B) is a potential mediator of membrane disruption,
as previous findings reveal that Cath B re-localizes from the lysosome to the cytosol, which has been shown by
other groups to initiate cell damage/death. I intend to evaluate the effects of secondary ICP elevation on the
NeuN- membrane disrupted population using sham, CFPI animals and CFPI+elevated ICP animals with the
same dextran protocol aforementioned, via microscopic and molecular approaches. Simultaneously, I will
investigate the role of Cath B in vivo by inhibiting Cath B following sham and injury then using activity assays to
verify inhibition as well as microscopic studies to evaluate the re-localization of Cath B. I expect in the F99 project
that diffuse TBI paired with elevated ICP will see increases in membrane disrupted population later. Yet, a
reduction in the compensatory NeuN- subpopulation as these neurons will endure a secondary insult. Finally, it
is expected that Cath-B is re-localizing from the lysosome to the cytosol after TBI in membrane disrupted neurons
and will be exacerbated with secondary ICP insult."

The overarching aim of this pre- and post-doctoral training program is to develop specialists who are able to
conduct basic research at levels ranging from the molecular to the cognitive/clinical, on the biological
mechanisms underlying the etiology, treatment and prevention of alcohol (ethanol) use disorders. Twenty
members of the graduate faculty of the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) serve as preceptors for
predoctoral students and postdoctoral research fellows in two graduate programs at OHSU—Behavioral
Neuroscience, and the Neuroscience Graduate Program. Major research interests represent areas of common
interest, such as genetic bases for ethanol responses and risk, learned and unlearned determinants of ethanol
reward, neurobiological bases for the rewarding, aversive and neuropathological effects of ethanol,
neuroadaptive mechanisms associated with repeated and/or developmental ethanol exposure, ethanol
dependence and sensitization, and effects of ethanol on memory, cognition and social behavior. In addition,
comparison to the effects of other drugs of abuse is of significant interest. Technical strategies reflect three
levels of analysis: I. Behavioral/cognitive/social, II. Neurophysiological/neuropharmacological/systems, III.
Cellular/molecular/genomic biological. Coordinated research efforts within the Portland Alcohol Research
Center (PARC), the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA) and Oregon National Primate
Research Center (ONPRC) have strengthened training by unifying investigators and creating multidimensional
research projects. Training includes firm curricular grounding in the basic sciences, specific pharmacological
training in ethanol and drug addiction, and extensive and continuous participation in research. Four predoctoral
trainees per year will be supported by the training grant for 2-3 years, and then by individual National Research
Service Awards or their mentors' resources. Three postdoctoral trainees per year will be supported by the
training grant for 2 years. We have a well-developed plan for improving the diversity of our trainees and all
trainees are expected to complete an initial intensive course in the Responsible Conduct of Research, as well
as continuing education in this area. Ample opportunities exist for our trainees to be involved in public
education and outreach."
10876899,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most of the 2.5 million children and adolescents living with HIV-1 (CALWH) worldwide reside in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Those who carry two copies of the APOL1 risk alleles (RA) are at higher risk of developing HIV-chronic
kidney diseases (HIV-CKD) if they are not treated continuously with modern anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
throughout childhood. During the last grant cycle, we followed the outcome of ~ 200 CALWH in the Washington
DC area for an average period of 5 years, and found that many developed HIV-CKD despite ART. We also found
that children with high plasma and urine levels of the heparin binding cytokine Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-
2), were at further risk of developing HIV-CKD, and that FGF-2 increased the renal recruitment and attachment
of HIV+ cells in mice. Thus, we hypothesize that FGF-2 release into the circulation accelerates the progression
of childhood HIV-CKD, acting in synergy with the APOL1-RA and other HIV proteins, by facilitating the renal
recruitment of HIV-infected cells, as well as the infection and/or injury of renal cells despite ART. We further
hypothesize that FGF-2 precipitates the detachment of viable podocytes and tubular epithelial cells (REc), and
that the phenotype and transcriptome profiles of these cells can be used to distinguish CALWH undergoing
HIVAN and/or other progressive HIV-CKD, and to follow their outcome in a non-invasive manner. This hypothesis
will be tested in three aims. In aim 1, we will define how FGF-2 and APOL1-RA interact to precipitate HIV-CKDs
in CALWH on ART, and define the clinical value of single cell urinary transcriptome profiles to distinguish CALWH
undergoing HIVAN and/or other progressive HIV-CKD. In aim 2, we will determine how FGF-2 and APOL1-RA
interact to modulate the infection, injury, and/or survival of HIV-infected cells cultured from children with HIV-
CKD. In aim 3, we will use two new mouse models of childhood HIV-CKD, to determine how FGF-2 interacts
with APOL1-RA and HIV-Nef to precipitate the detachment of podocytes/REc and accelerate the progression of
HIV-CKD. In addition, we will identify the most relevant signaling pathways involved in these processes, and
define how drugs that block the selected pathways affect the progression of HIV-CKD in young mice."
10877011,"AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults, and it appears increasingly with age. Despite overall
improvement in the treatment of leukemia, AML still carries a devastating prognosis for elderly patients (less
than 10% of patients survive for 5 years). Thus, new therapies for AML are necessary. AMPK is a metabolic
regulator that promotes catabolism and inhibits anabolism, thereby maintaining metabolic homeostasis upon
metabolic stress. Using mouse models and AMPK inhibitors, we demonstrated that AMPK inhibition renders
AML sensitive to metabolic stress induced by dietary restriction (Saito et al. Cell Stem Cell. 2015). During this
study, we noticed that AMPK deletion reduces acetyl-coA and histone acetylation in AML (Fig. 2), concomitant
with decreased expression of critical leukemia-promoting genes such as Myc. Importantly, chromatin
immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that AMPK deletion reduces the occupancy of
acetylated histones, all of which marks active genes and recruits transcriptional regulators. We thus
hypothesized that AMPK links metabolism to epigenetics in AML by maintaining histone acetylation. In aim 1 we
will determine whether the occupancy of transcriptional regulators in AML is regulated by AMPK. In aim 2, we
will determine how metabolites and the metabolic enzymes that produces acetyl-coA regulate histone
acetylation. In aim 3, we will determine how AMPK-mediated histone acetylation regulates human AML, by
generating patient-derived xenograft models of AML. Taken together, this proposal will establish the link between
metabolism and epigenetics, more specifically the links between acetyl-CoA metabolism, AMPK, and histone
acetylation. We hypothesize that these interactions are essential to recruit transcriptional regulators to key
leukemogenic genes. In the next funding cycle, we anticipate to unveil new insights that will inform us on how
metabolic regulators could be targeted to sensitize AML to epigenetic drugs, paving the way to novel
combinatorial therapies."
10877015,"Abstract
Substance use disorder is multifactorial with genetic and environmental contributions and this illness is a
leading cause of death worldwide. Approaches from single disciplines have done much to advance science,
and methodological and technological advances have established the need for increasingly multidisciplinary
approaches to address complex questions about substance use disorder. Bringing this potential of scientific
discovery to advance the prevention and treatment of substance use disorder requires clinician scientists who
can bridge the gaps between scientific discovery and clinical care. The goal of the K12 program is to train the
next generation of clinician scientists to fill these gaps and undertake this important and exciting work. To
accomplish this goal, we have established three aims:
1. Expand the workforce of clinician scientists in the prevention and treatment of substance use
 disorder. We will fund two scholar faculty positions per year at Washington University School of Medicine.
 Using a scholar-centric approach, we will design a career development plan that will meet each scholar’s
 needs and interests. We will provide short-term and long-term mentorship through formal mentoring
 relationships with local and national faculty and advisors from multiple disciplines. New opportunities to aid
 the scholars include wellness and resilience support, career coaching, and guidance for work/life balance.
 We are committed to the training and retention of scholars from diverse backgrounds.
2. Continue to develop and enhance the K12 career development opportunities and continue robust
 evaluation and tracking of K12 scholars, faculty, mentors, curriculum, and training opportunities.
 We will enhance our current program by implementing online individual career development plans that can
 be monitored by scholars, mentors, and Program Directors. A Research Navigator will increase support of
 the scholars in managing and conducting their research projects. We will monitor and evaluate the
 scholars, mentors, faculty and training programs using surveys, interviews, and other metrics.
3. Establish a national network of NIDA K12 Program Directors and scholars. This national consortium
 will serve as an avenue of communication between Program Directors and scholars across all NIDA K12
 programs, creating a community with common goals, with the intent to share resources, enhance
 networking, and foster the development of the next generation of researchers in substance use disorder.
Successful completion of these aims will result in increased numbers of diverse, well-trained clinician scientists
in the prevention and treatment of substance use disorder and its consequences."
10877074,"ABSTRACT
Folates are anionic molecules that cross biological membranes poorly by diffusion. Folate uptake is principally
mediated by the reduced folate carrier (RFC; SLC19A1) and the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT;
SLC46A1). Upon internalization, folates facilitate one-carbon (C1) metabolism, leading to synthesis of glycine,
serine and methionine, and purine nucleotides and thymidylate. C1 metabolism encompasses cytosolic and
mitochondrial pathways connected by an interchange between serine, glycine and formate. The ubiquitously
expressed RFC is the major membrane transporter for folates in cells and tissues. RFC is also an important
transporter of clinically used C1 inhibitors (e.g., pemetrexed) for cancer, as well as other indications, and loss of
RFC is associated with drug resistance. PCFT mediates folate absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
PCFT levels in other tissues are generally modest. Unlike RFC, PCFT transport is optimal at acidic pH,
approximating the tumor microenvironment. PCFT is widely expressed in human tumor cell lines and primary
specimens. We discovered novel cytotoxic PCFT-targeted C1 inhibitors for cancer and established a
comprehensive structure-activity relationship for PCFT that is distinct from RFC. Novel pyrrolopyrimidine
compounds (AGF94 & AGF347) showed potent anti-proliferative activities toward PCFT-expressing tumors
that were augmented at acid pH. Following internalization, AGF94 inhibited de novo purine (DNP) biosyn-
thesis at β-glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFTase), whereas AGF347 inhibited mito-
chondrial C1 metabolism at serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), with additional effects on C1
metabolism in the cytosol (DNP biosynthesis at GARFTase and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
ribonucleotide formyltransferase, and at SHMT1). Both inhibitors depleted ATP; AGF347 depleted glycine and
cytosolic C1 pools, with downstream effects on glutathione and levels of reactive oxygen species, and on mTOR
signaling. AGF94 and AGF347 showed promising in vivo efficacies toward early and upstage tumor xeno-
grafts. We posit that our PCFT-targeted agents offer an entirely new approach for treating cancer. In this R01
renewal, we explore the unique biology of the facilitative folate transporters and C1 metabolism, with a goal
of further optimizing therapeutic applications of our novel agents. We propose in Aim 1 to characterize the
cellular pharmacodynamics and molecular regulation of PCFT in relation to PCFT-targeted therapies, including
transcriptional mechanisms and the role of protein-protein interactions in regulating PCFT. In Aim 2, we will
characterize the cellular pharmacodynamics of mitochondrial C1 inhibitors including their transport and
metabolism. An important focus of both Aims 1 and 2 will be on the role of the tumor microenvironment,
including the impact of hypoxia and acid pH on anti-tumor drug biology and efficacy of these series. Our
proposed studies are distinctive for their novelty and focus on clinical translation."
10877075,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe neurologic syndrome affecting more than 12,000 newborns
in the United States each year. HIE results in death or neurodevelopmental disabilities in about half of affected
neonates. The causes of HIE are heterogeneous and poorly understood. Chorioamnionitis, or intrauterine
infection/inflammation, gives rise to a fetal inflammatory response syndrome that may reduce a fetus’ ability to
tolerate hypoxia-ischemia during delivery. Chorioamnionitis has been associated with a 4-fold increased risk of
HIE, and may also reduce the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia, the only available therapy for HIE. However,
chorioamnionitis is an imprecise clinical diagnosis that refers to a spectrum of conditions. Clinical evidence of
inflammation (“clinical chorioamnionitis”) during labor and delivery relies on the presence of maternal fever which
is non-specific. Fever occurs in 5% of laboring mothers and can be caused by other factors such as epidural
analgesia. A better understanding of the relationship between chorioamnionitis, maternal fever and HIE is crucial
to improving our ability to prevent and treat HIE. A recent NICHD consensus report recommended a more precise
definition of clinical chorioamnionitis (“Chorio-NICHD”) based on specific cut-offs for maternal temperature,
maternal white cell count, and fetal tachycardia. But how Chorio-NICHD relates to HIE risk is unknown. Whether
the presence of Chorio-NICHD reduces the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia has also not been
studied. To fill these gaps in knowledge, I will test the hypothesis that Chorio-NICHD is independently associated
with a higher risk of HIE in the child, and is associated with increased risk of HIE brain injury despite treatment
with therapeutic hypothermia. By leveraging a large birth cohort with rich data spanning perinatal, neonatal, and
childhood periods, I will: 1. Quantify the association between Chorio-NICHD, including clinical features such as
height and duration of maternal fever, degree of leukocytosis, and degree of fetal tachycardia, and HIE.
2. Determine if chorioamnionitis defined by clinical or histologic criteria is associated with severity of MRI brain
injury in neonates with HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia. 3. Quantify the association between Chorio-
NICHD and childhood neurodevelopmental impairment. As a neonatologist and clinical researcher, my career
objective is to become an independent physician-epidemiologist generating actionable evidence that optimizes
diagnosis and treatment of neonatal brain disorders. With this K23, I will pursue advanced training in neonatal
brain disease epidemiology, develop skills in electronic health data management and longitudinal data analyses.
I will receive training in the analysis of neonatal brain MRI findings and placental histology. This career award,
with its rigorous training program and outstanding mentorship team, will allow me to become a leader in the field
of neonatal neurology and an independent physician-scientist. In years 4-5 of this award, I will be poised to
submit an R01 to study novel strategies for preventing and treating neonates with HIE in the setting of intrauterine
inflammation.

10877186,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the number of adults age 65 and older continue to increase, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and
other related dementias (ADRD) is also expected to increase in the U.S. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)
such as agitation, apathy, depression, and sleep disturbance are highly prevalent in patients with ADRD, with
up to 97% of the individuals suffering at least one NPS over the disease course. NPS requires considerable
management and time by care partners, and are associated with rapid cognitive and functional decline, worse
quality of life, greater care partner burden, and earlier nursing home admissions. Although nonpharmacological
intervention for NPS is recommended, psychotropic medications continue to be widely prescribed, resulting in
adverse events. Similar to ADRD, the prevalence of hearing loss increases with age. However, hearing care as
tertiary prevention for older adults who have already developed cognitive impairment has largely been ignored.
MPIs and the Co-Is of the current proposal have been working together for many years, demonstrating that i)
there is a high prevalence of hearing loss among indiviudals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD,
ii) increasing severity of hearing loss is associated with greater number of NPS and NPS severity, and that iii) a
user-centered hearing care intervention that utilizes emerging over-the-counter (OTC) hearing technology may
ameliorate NPS. The current proposal is based upon a prior NIA Stage 1b trial that involved an initial pilot
study of a hearing care intervention that utilized OTC hearing devices and was delivered in an outpatient
setting. The proposed study returns to Stage 1a and 1b to refine and test the preliminary efficacy of a revised
hearing care intervention strategy that targets NPS and examines the underlying mechanism(s) of action. Aim
1 seeks to refine the hearing care intervention through a Stage 1a study that involves consultation with experts
and end-users to develop a revised intervention protocol that integrates the latest evidence-informed
approaches to NPS along with alignment with theoretical frameworks, consideration of implementation
challenges encountered in the initial pilot study, and the ability to deliver the intervention in various settings,
including the home. Aim 2 will then assess the preliminary efficacy of the revised hearing care intervention
through a larger Stage 1b randomized controlled trial, which will allow for greater rigor in assessing the
intervention than prior work. Aim 3 will employ a mixed methods approach to characterize response
heterogeneity and underlying mechanism(s) of action. The proposed study embraces the iterative and
multidirectional nature of the NIA Stage Model with the goal of developing impactful behavioral interventions
that reach the maximum level of potency and potentially implementable to the maximum number of older
adults. This proposal builds critical foundational knowledge regarding the role of hearing care as an integral
component of managing NPS. These findings will directly translate to a larger Stage 2/3 efficacy trial."
10877187,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a curative therapy for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia
(AML); however, relapse remains the leading cause of death post-SCT. AML cures post-SCT depend upon
both the intensity of the conditioning therapy and the ability of donor immune cells to recognize and destroy
host leukemia cells via the graft versus leukemia effect (GvL). AML has a low mutational burden and therefore
a low number of predicted tumor specific neoantigens. Consequently, GvL is most likely mediated by donor T
cell recognition of minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA) presented on leukemia (and/or hematopoietic) cells
by MHC class I and II. This general concept has not been tested in detail however, because of limitations in
predicting, identifying and then validating the mHA responsible for the GVL effect in any given SCT recipient.
 To more fully address the role of GvL mHA responses in controlling AML, we will investigate GvL
responses in primary human samples to test our central hypothesis that AML relapse after SCT results from
insufficient donor T cell responses to GvL mHA. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a human tissue
collection protocol in HLA-matched related donor (MRD) SCTs to measure the global magnitude and diversity
of donor derived GvL mHA specific T cell responses in SCT. To accomplish this goal, we will determine the in
vitro immunogenicity of computationally predicted and biochemically confirmed (by targeted mass
spectrometry) GvL mHA using a combination of ELISpot, single T cell microraft array cytotoxicity, and single T
cell microraft array proliferation measurements. We will map the TCRβ sequences of the GvL mHA specific T
cells onto the TCRβ repertoires of alloreactive T cells post-SCT. We will also investigate the intrinsic resistance
to GvL mHA specific T cell mediated cytotoxicity in AML blasts that relapse following SCT using our microraft
arrays, and we will associate resistance to GvL mHA specific T cell cytotoxicity with differences in
transcriptome profiles measured by single cell RNA sequencing.
 The research in this proposal will provide understanding of the role of GvL mHA in control of AML post-
SCT. Because SCT is the most effective form of immunotherapy for AML at this time, our investigations into
the magnitude and diversity of mHA targets required to achieve effective AML control could lead to rational

Recent advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma with targeted therapies are highly successful initially
but are ultimately limited by the development of tumor resistance. On the other hand, checkpoint inhibitors are
associated with durable responses but only benefit a minority of patients. The aims of all of the projects in this
application are to understand the mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome resistance to both combined
targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies in melanoma. The proposed studies require an
efficient Biospecimen Core that can provide a variety of high quality biospecimens to the investigators. The
specific aims of the Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC - Core B) of the PPG are to: 1 )
Centralize performance of specialized pathology services, including biosample (tissue and biofluid) storage,
tracking, distribution and analysis; 2) Provide well-characterized melanoma tissues, cell lines and short-term
cultures from patients enrolled on combination therapies and treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors or checkpoint
inhibitors and prospectively develop additional cell lines; and 3) Develop techniques to better characterize cells
from within the tumor microenvironment for more sophisticated analysis in situ and at the single cell level. BRPC
provide the advanced expertise in melanoma biology, cell line development, pathologic interpretation and
biorepository management that is required by all proposed studies."

Cerebral aneurysms occur in about 6% of the population and have a very high morbidity and mortality rate if they
rupture. Fortunately, most unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) rarely cause symptoms and do not require
an invasive treatment that may itself causes severe cerebrovascular disorders. However, it is very difﬁcult to
predict which UIAs will rupture. Recent evaluations of the hemodynamic features of UIAs, using 4D Flow MRI
(4DF), have shown promising results that suggest speciﬁc hemodynamic variables may have a great impact on
aneurysm growth or rupture. However, the clinical applicability of these hemodynamic variables in predicting UIA
growth has not yet been realized due to the lack of robust methods for gathering them, and also for describing their
relationship to UIA growth. To ﬁll in the gaps, the proposed research aims to develop a comprehensive statistical
and computational framework to predict: (a) the growth of UIAs at the 24th month (b) their growth trajectory over
a ﬁve-year period. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to improve the UIA growth prediction that, in
turn, will improve the UIA rupture risk assessment. Toward achieving this goal, we will develop a unique tensor
regression machine learning framework that will (1) enhance 4DF resolution (2) predict the UIA growth at the 24th
month and (3) predict the longitudinal UIA growth trajectory. Successful completion of the proposed research will
provide a comprehensive computational system that can assist physicians when deciding whether a patient with
UIA needs treatment, or follow-up imaging, as well as the time interval for the surveillance imaging."

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) increases with age and occurs when a single mutant
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) contributes to a significant clonal proportion of mature blood lineages. CHIP is
associated with increased risks of developing hematological malignancies. TP53 mutations rank in the top 5
among mutations identified in CHIP and clinical studies showed that expansion of TP53 mutated HSCs with
age predisposes individuals with CHIP to myeloid neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
During the previous funding period, we found that mutant p53 utilizes a cell intrinsic mechanism to drive clonal
hematopoiesis through enhancing EZH2 activity and increasing H3K27me3 in HSCs. However, there is a
significant gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which extrinsic factors drive TP53 mutant clonal
hematopoiesis. In the competitive renewal, we will focus on determining the impact of inflammatory stress on
TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis and developing novel strategies for preventing the progression of clonal
hematopoiesis to MDS. Infection activates inflammatory response and induces chronic inflammation. We
discovered that bacterial infection confers a competitive advantage to p53 mutant hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) via activating the NLRP1 inflammasome and increasing the secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we found that some p53 mutant mice developed MDS with age and
that there are increased levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the BM of aged p53 mutant mice. We hypothesize that
mutant p53 enhances inflammatory stress via activating the NLRP1 inflammasome and increasing the secretion
of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby generating a chronic inflammatory microenvironment that inhibits wild
type (WT) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fitness in a paracrine fashion. We further speculate
that reducing chronic inflammation will prevent or delay the progression of TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis
to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To test the hypothesis, we will determine the mechanisms by which
inflammatory stress drives TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis. We will develop novel strategies that block
TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis from progression to MDS. Delineating the impact of inflammatory stress on
p53 mutant HSPC expansion will fill a significant knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms by which extrinsic
factors drive TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis and promote the development of MDS."

Voice disorders are among the most common communication disorders and estimated to affect 3-9% of
Americans annually. These disorders are often associated with laryngeal inflammation secondary to epithelial
injuries following phonotrauma, surgical resection, radiation, and various infectious processes. Serious injury
can lead to disordered mucosal remodeling, scar formation, and a profound dysphonia. Bacterial dysbiosis, a
disturbance in the microbial community structure, is implicated in a variety of inflammatory disease etiologies in
mucosal systems, however, understanding of laryngeal microbiota and their protective mechanisms against
mucosal inflammation remains limited. To date, laryngeal microbiome studies have been limited to
characterization of microbial communities in disease states of the larynx. Research in regard to bacterial
contributions to the maintenance and regeneration of laryngeal mucosa is still lacking. The overall goal of this
work is to identify bacterial species associated with each stage of epithelial wound healing in the larynx and
define the role of laryngeal microbiota in modulation of epithelial regeneration through a longitudinal study
using a unique combination of gnotobiotic laryngeal model and naphthalene induced epithelial injury model.
Aim 1 will investigate the role of resident microbiota in the acute wound healing of laryngeal epithelium by
measuring the expression of inflammatory markers and barrier protection associated genes in the larynges of
naphthalene injected germ-free mice and gnotobiotic mice colonized with laryngeal microbiota. Aim 2 will
identify wound-associated bacterial species by delineating the longitudinal dynamics of bacterial compositions
at multiple timepoints through wound healing process. Gnotobiotic mice colonized with candidate bacterial
species will be assessed with and without antibiotics treatment to confirm their beneficial or pathogenic
influence that promotes or inhibits laryngeal wound healing. Our overarching hypothesis is that laryngeal
microbiota is a significant contributor to the healing of injured epithelium in the larynx. By clarifying the role of
resident microbiota in laryngeal wound repair process, completion of our specific aims will have a direct
significant impact on our current understanding of laryngology, bacteriology, and laryngeal immunology.
Results of this novel application will lead to new facets of understanding for host-microbiome interactions and
will ultimately be used to develop innovative prevention and treatment strategies for laryngeal diseases with
mucosal injury."

This Chemosensory Training Program (CTP), operating within the interdisciplinary Program in
Neuroscience at Florida State University, is a continuing application in its 25th year. The CTP
Program is geared to train the next generation of researchers to become leaders in basic neural
mechanisms of chemosensory systems interfaced with behavior. The program prepares 4 pre-
and 2 post-doctoral trainees for research careers focused on olfactory and gustatory senses in
context. One important context is the regulation of food intake and metabolic state,
dysregulation of which can lead to obesity and diabetes, or anorexia. The powerful links
between chemosensory systems and brain circuitry associated with emotional, motivational, and
neuromodulatory processes requires a wide perspective for full understanding. The broad long-
term objective is to provide the basic neuroscience platform upon which clinical understanding
of chemosensory disease is built using a wide spectrum of experimental approaches including
molecular neurobiology, neurophysiology, biophysics, psychophysics, and behavioral analysis.
The strength of the CTP program that anticipates to provide 2 and 4 years of training for
approximately five post- and fifteen pre-doctoral scholars, respectively, is the close guidance of
trainees by expert faculty whom are accustomed to productive collaborations fostered from a
wealth of historical chemosensory knowledge that shapes cutting-edge investigations for
training. Trainees have access to state-of-the-art custom-designed chemosensory equipment,
technical support staff, and new building infrastructure to perform their research. Value-added
activities include – 1) chemosensory tutorials (readings and lab practicum), 2) evening gather-
ings (presentations, rigor and reproducibility training, and webinars), 3) chemosensory retreat
(research progress/sharing and mentor/mentee career development), 4) structured oral, written,
and analysis skill building and feedback, 5) depth of a continually evolving curriculum, and 6) an
opportunity for alumni and speaker interaction that relays latest discoveries, allows career
networking, and provides supplementary evaluation of the training program. The CTP Training
Outcomes continue to be outstanding as reflected in published productivity, trainee extramural
grants, and job placement (95%-predoc and 100%- postdoc in research-intensive and -related
positions). Ten expert chemosensory trainers will shape the intellectual and scientific practice of
trainees at two levels as they bridge to independent and externally-funded scientific research
programs in chemosensory problems important for the quality of life and human health."

Endothelial dysfunction is an early defect in obesity, which is a major contributor to increased cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality such as arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Recent studies have
demonstrated a critical role of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-ceramide signaling in instigation of Nlrp3
inflammasomes and endothelial dysfunction during obesity and diabetes. The present proposal seeks to
explore a novel mechanism mediating transcriptional control of ASM gene expression in ECs and determine
how dysregulated ASM expression and activity promote vascular injury in obesity. Enhancer of zeste homolog
2 (Ezh2) is a histone methyltransferase that normally suppresses methylated genes, serving as a crucial
epigenetic regulatory mechanism in gene expression. In preliminary studies, we found that loss of Ezh2
function increased ASM expression and ceramide levels in the intima leading to neointimal lesions in the
carotid arteries of mice fed high fat diet (HFD). Such Ezh2-mediated suppression of ASM gene expression
and ceramide signaling were also confirmed in cultured ECs. Based on these observations, we propose a
hypothesis that loss of endothelial Ezh2 function upregulates ASM gene expression and augments ceramide
production under hyperlipidemic conditions, which trigger Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and produce
endothelial injury resulting in subsequent neointimal lesions on the carotid arterial wall. To test this hypothesis,
the following Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether endothelial ASM activation
due to loss of Ezh2 function contributes to endothelial dysfunction or injury at the early stage of obesity using
endothelium-specific Ezh2 knockout mice (Ezh2ecKO) and their wild type littermates. Specific Aim 2 attempts
to test how Ezh2-regulated ASM activation leads to endothelial dysfunction or injury by studying the role of
ceramide and ceramide-enriched membrane rafts, Nlrp3 inflammasome activation, pyroptosis, endothelium-
dependent vasodilation, inter-endothelial junction disruption, and adaptive endothelial progenitor cell landing
or differentiation. In Specific Aim 3, we will explore the molecular mechanisms by which loss of Ezh2 function
activates ASM with a main focus on the roles of histone and DNA methylation in cultured ECs from Ezh2ecKO
mice and their wild type littermates. The findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of endothelial
dysfunction and identify Ezh2-ASM pathway as therapeutic target for prevention or treatment of vaculopathy
associated with obesity."
10880433,"Myocardial infarction (MI)-induced heart failure is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
States. About one in four MI patients will progress to develop chronic heart failure, which has a 5-year mortality
rate of 40%. It is highly urgent to improve long-term outcomes of MI patients. Lymphopenia, a reduction in
peripheral blood lymphocyte count (primarily due to T-cell loss), has consistently been shown to correlate with
worse cardiac function and poor outcome in MI patients and is an independent marker to predict the prognosis.
Unfortunately, how T lymphopenia occurs following MI and whether targeting T lymphopenia has therapeutic
potential are largely unknown. Using the mouse MI-induced ischemic heart failure model, our preliminary data
showed that MI-induced T lymphopenia may involve blood T-cell redistribution to the bone marrow and T cell
development impairment. CD4+ T-cell activation is known to improve wound healing post-MI. Thus, persistent
CD4+ T lymphopenia may reduce protective CD4+ T-cell response and compromise myocardial repair after MI.
The goals of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that cause T lymphopenia following
MI; and 2) to investigate whether inhibiting CD4+ T lymphopenia can serve as a therapeutic strategy. We
hypothesize that MI induces T lymphopenia by both stimulating T-cell trafficking from blood to the bone marrow
and impairing T lymphopoiesis; inhibiting CD4+ T lymphopenia improves post-MI cardiac repair. Three specific
aims will address this novel hypothesis in a mouse ischemic heart failure model that combines multidisciplinary
approaches. Specific Aim 1 will examine the mechanisms of blood T-cell trafficking to the bone marrow and
alterations of distinct T-cell phenotypes and functions after MI. Specific Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by
which MI impairs T lymphopoiesis. Specific Aim 3 will examine the hypothesis that inhibiting CD4+ T lymphopenia
would improve post-MI cardiac repair. Accomplishment of this proposal will provide new insights into T
lymphopenia mechanisms in ischemic heart failure and may offer potential intervention strategies to improve the
prognosis of heart failure patients."

Despite increased attention over the past decade, alcohol-involved sexual violence continues to be widespread
on college campuses. Existing interventions, which include bystander training, education programs, and brief
interventions, take an essentially global approach to the prevention of harmful alcohol use and sexual violence,
and largely neglect the social and situational contexts in which drinking occurs. A combination of campus
policies, behavioral interventions, and community-level interventions are likely needed to address this complex
problem. Alcohol-involved sexual violence can be conceptualized as a system with feedback loops between
various individual-level behaviors as well as between contexts and behaviors. Agent-based models (ABMs) are
a methodological tool that can incorporate dynamics between behavioral, social, and structural environments
and their impacts on hazardous alcohol use and sexual violence. They can be used to simulate the
implementation of intervention(s) across a wide range of college campuses and populations. The usefulness of
a given ABM, however, is limited by its accuracy, focus, and salience to end users. A stakeholder-engaged
model-building process greatly enhances the relevance and usefulness of models that explicitly account for
dynamic processes. The overall goal of this proposal is to create a stakeholder-designed ABM that can serve
as a decision support tool to help campuses reduce alcohol-involved sexual violence among students. To
achieve this goal, we will first develop a stakeholder-designed systems model of hazardous drinking, SV, and
intervention opportunities on college campuses through a series of stakeholder-engaged model building
sessions guided by a Core Modeling Team (Aim 1). We will leverage a learning collaborative of campus
stakeholders including students, practitioners from health and counseling centers, Title IX coordinators,
residential counselors, and so forth, from an ongoing alcohol-involved SV RCT involving 28 college campuses
in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to recruit 60 student and non-student stakeholder experts to 6 stakeholder
model building groups. The integrated systems model will be then translated into an ABM of alcohol use and
sexual violence using an ABM platform with realistic synthetic populations that provides a population
foundation for community-based simulations (The Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiologic Dynamics
(FRED)) (Aim 2). We will then develop and assess the preliminary feasibility of stakeholder-informed, ABM-
based decision support tools to optimize campus interventions to reduce alcohol-involved sexual violence
(Exploratory Aim 3). This innovative, empirically-based approach, using stakeholder-engaged modeling to
design an ABM and ABM-based decision support tools, can guide campus-level policy and programmatic
changes, leading to improved implementation of effective strategies to address alcohol-involved sexual
violence, promote prevention strategies among students, and stimulate campus-level policy changes."

This is a DP2 NIAID New Innovators Award proposal to harness cell-to-cell variability to understand viral infection
outcomes at the single cell level. Infected cells differ in the outcome of infection (abortive/productive), the timing and
level of viral gene expression and the number of progeny they produce. Two striking phenomena revealed by studying
infection at the single cell level are (1) the ability of some cells to abort infection after viral gene expression has
commenced and (2) the fact most infected cells release very few progeny while a small fraction of cells release thousands
(here termed “super producers”). While it is now accepted that cell-to-cell variability affects infection outcome, we
currently lack a molecular understating of the determinants of infection outcome in single cells, mainly due to the lack of
appropriate tools and methodologies.
Understanding these determinants is likely to lead to the discovery of novel cellular anti-viral modalities, better design of
therapeutics and deepen our understanding of the viral life cycle. In this proposal I will apply cutting-edge technologies to
investigate virus-host interactions at the single cell level and gain mechanistic insights as to the host factors that control
the opposing phenotypes of abortive infection and super producers.
My central hypothesis, supported by my past work and preliminary data using Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) as a model
system, is that infection outcome at the single cell level is dependent on the cell’s state at the time of infection and on the
activation of specific cellular transcriptional programs. To test this hypothesis I will develop new approaches to interrogate
virus-host interactions by combining viral genetics, single-cell RNA-sequencing, custom-made microfluidic devices, live-
cell imaging and machine learning approaches. My background in performing cross-disciplinary research through the
combination of classical virology, cell-biology, microfluidics and systems biology to study virus-host interactions uniquely
positions me to successfully tackle these important questions. My results will identify the host factors that determine
infection outcome and define a new paradigm, using cell-to-cell variability to understand virus-host interactions. The tools
and technologies will be developed using HSV-1 as a model system, and then applied to investigate other important viral
pathogens, in collaboration with leading virologists.
This “high-risk high-reward” project requires a considerable investment of time and resources and the construction of
new tools, making it a perfect fit for the DP2 program. The award will allow me to pursue cutting-edge science at the
interface of virology and single cell biology and establish a long-term research plan to decipher the cellular mechanisms
that control infection outcome."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature that leads to right
heart failure and death. Patients with scleroderma (SSc) are at high risk for the development of PAH (SSc-PAH),
which is a leading cause of death in SSc. While advances in PAH therapeutics have led to improved outcomes,
survival in SSc-PAH remains dismal, with 57% of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Thus, there is an
urgent need to expand therapeutic options in SSc-PAH, and to identify novel markers of disease risk and severity.
PAH pathogenesis is highly complex, with simultaneous dysregulation of multiple biologic pathways, yet current
therapies for PAH target just three pathways that regulate vasomotor tone. One potentially targetable metabolic
regulator is the protein xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which metabolizes purines in an enzymatic reaction that
generates uric acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative injury from over-abundant ROS drives
endothelial cell dysfunction, altered metabolic signaling, and endothelial apoptosis, all early features of PAH
pathobiology. XOR activity increases in experimental PH models, and XOR inhibition with allopurinol prevents
pulmonary hypertensive changes from occurring. XOR activity is increased in PAH patients compared to healthy
controls, and our preliminary data show that serum UA/XOR levels and purine metabolites significantly correlate
with hemodynamics and predict outcomes in SSc-PAH patients. However, XOR has not been studied as a driver
of disease and potential therapeutic target in SSc-PAH.
We hypothesize that increased XOR activity contributes to PAH development in SSc and drives disease
progression through oxidative injury and altered metabolism. By leveraging two rich data sources – the world's
largest known SSc serum biorepository, and an NIH-sponsored prospective cohort of newly diagnosed SSc-PAH
patients - we aim to 1) demonstrate that increased XOR activity and oxidative stress influence development of
PAH in patients with scleroderma, 2) link XOR activity and oxidative stress with phenotypic and outcome data in
SSc-PAH (with a special focus on right ventricular structural and functional phenotypes), and 3) identify metabolic
patterns associated with poor clinical response to currently available PAH therapies. These aims will examine
the role of XOR activity and oxidative stress in SSc-PAH in order to clarify the potential of XOR as a therapeutic
target, and to lay a groundwork for personalized selection of PAH therapies in SSc."

Microbial phosphonic acids are a class of understudied natural products with significant utility in medicine. The
antimicrobial, antiviral, and antimalarial activity of many useful phosphonic acids derives from potent and
specific inhibition of metabolic enzymes through chemical mimicry of their natural substrates. These properties,
along with the trove of novel biosynthetic gene clusters encoded within microbial genomic datasets, highlight
their potential of phosphonic acid natural products new antimicrobials. In this project we focus our efforts on
realizing their genomic potential of these compounds by establishing fundamental genetic and biochemical
principles that define their biosynthetic and bioactivity landscape. Filling these gaps in knowledge will provide a
systems-level understanding of natural product biosynthesis necessary to improve discovery and engineering
of new phosphonic acids. Specifically, we investigate three recently discovered phosphonic acid peptides to
uncover unusual hydroxylation, reduction, amination, and amino acid ligation enzymes, and the molecular
basis of their antimicrobial activity. We expand and refine the framework for phosphonic acid natural product
genomics through the isolation of new compounds from cryptic gene clusters, discovery of new pathways and
enzymes for C-P bond formation, and the development of a classification scheme to improve prediction of
phosphonic acid gene clusters and their chemical products."

Stuttering is a highly variable condition: People exhibit different amounts of stuttering behavior in different
tasks, when talking to different people, in different settings, and at different times. Although variability is
widely acknowledged, most assessments of stuttering behavior, whether conducted in a clinical setting or
for research, involve brief speech samples collected in a small number of settings that do not reflect
natural communication (e.g., monologuing or reading aloud). Unfortunately, we do not know if these
clinic/laboratory measures are representative of people's speaking experiences in the real world. Ample
evidence suggests that they are not, but the vast majority of clinical work and research on stuttering still
does not account for this variability. This raises questions about the validity of existing research that
relies on measures that may not be reflective of people's true stuttering behavior.
In this project, we seek to overcome these uncertainties about the validity of stuttering measurement.
We will collect the largest-ever samples of the everyday speech of people who stutter through
continuous recording of conversational interactions over a 7-day period. This will allow us to
examine the full range of stuttering behaviors that people exhibit across situations and over time.
For Aim 1, we will use these unprecedentedly large speech samples to test whether current practices of
collecting brief speech samples in clinical or laboratory settings are adequate. Pilot data and prior studies
suggests that a broader range of measures will be needed in order to better reflect people's true stuttering
behaviors. For Aim 2, we will develop a measurement model for stuttering using latent variable modeling
to support new methods for evaluating stuttering that are more reflective of real-world variability. For Aim
3, we will use structural regression modeling to explore the ways in which key personal characteristics,
such as the ways in which a person responds to stuttering, contribute to the experience of variability. For
Aim 4, we will conduct a mixed-methods study to explore how variability affects the adverse impact that
stuttering has on people's lives, with the ultimate goal of improving the assessment of stuttering so
that we can reduce adverse impact and enhance quality of life for people who stutter.
Overall Impact: Our findings will increase our understanding of the factors that contribute to the variability
of stuttering and provide needed guidance for improving assessment of stuttering in clinical and laboratory
settings. We will make our carefully transcribed, annotated speech samples available through
FluencyBank, so that other researchers can use our data to answer many unanswered questions about
stuttering in the real world. Our work has the potential to disrupt current thinking about stuttering
measurement while simultaneously providing a solution about how researchers and clinicians can
better assess stuttering to gather more representative measures of people's fluency in their daily lives."

Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are now commercially available for automated interpretation of screening mammography. These AI technologies hold promise for improving screening performance and outcomes for the 40 million U.S. women who undergo routine breast cancer screening each year. Federal regulatory approval of new AI technologies requires only a demonstration of non-inferior accuracy to existing computer-aided detection systems in small, retrospective reader studies, but their widespread clinical translation is contingent upon more robust population-based evaluation. Specifically, the impact of these AI technologies on actual patient outcomes needs to be assessed, including whether or not they lead to improved detection of clinically meaningful cancers in the general screening population. Robust external validation of AI algorithms for mammography screening has thus far been limited by use of single institution datasets not representative of the entire target population, use of AI algorithms that are not publicly available, comparison to radiologist performance in enriched case sets, limited follow-up time for cancer diagnoses influencing ground truth labels, and evaluation on 2D digital mammography rather than 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) exams. Our study objective is to conduct a comparative evaluation of four commercially available AI technologies for automated DBT screening interpretation that overcomes all of these limitations and then estimate the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of AI-driven DBT screening at the U.S. population level. Specifically, we will 1) use a centralized honest broker, model-to-data paradigm infrastructure to perform an independent, external validation of four leading commercial AI technologies for DBT screening using prospectively collected data obtained from seven diverse U.S. regional breast imaging registries; 2) stratify AI vs. radiologist performance on detailed woman-, exam-, radiologist-, and tumor-level characteristics to inform targeted algorithm training and refinement efforts to ensure generalizability of the AI algorithms; 3) explore targeted approaches for improving clinical workflow efficiency by using AI to safely triage exams highly likely to be negative; and 4) use a validated breast cancer microsimulation model to determine population-level, long-term health benefits, harms, and costs associated with four commercially available AI technologies for DBT screening both as a standalone screening tool and as a second independent reader to radiologist interpretation. Our proposed study will represent the most objective and rigorous evaluation of deep learning algorithms for DBT screening interpretation in the U.S. to date. Our results will provide urgently needed evidence to inform key stakeholders including women, physicians, payers, industry partners, and policymakers regarding how to maximize the value of AI technologies for DBT screening prior to their widespread clinical translation."

disease course and a rapid decline in β-cell function, and many also have multiple cardiovascular disease risk
factors at an early age. The disease is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, but the
molecular underpinnings of T2D are not yet fully elucidated. This study aims to uncover the role of arginine
metabolism in the pathogenesis of pediatric T2D and the effect of exogenous arginine administration on β-cell
function in children with T2D. Arginine is a known stimulant of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Nitric oxide
(NO) is synthesized from arginine by NO synthase, and arginine stimulates insulin secretion in both NO-mediated
and NO-independent mechanisms by stimulating guanylate cyclase, membrane depolarization, and metabolic
by-products. The effects of arginine in pancreatic β-cells are dependent on the cells’ available arginine
concentration. Kinetic techniques using isotope tracer infusions and targeted metabolomics provide a unique
opportunity to determine “intracellular” arginine availability and its relative contribution of various pathways to
this pool. Such studies in adults with T2D have shown that arginine and NO play roles in the pathogenesis of
T2D by affecting insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. In a subset of the T2D population, namely, those with
ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD), our group found that adults with KPD had a unique metabolomic signature with a
significant reduction in “intracellular” arginine availability during hyperglycemia. Moreover, their insulin secretory
responses were restored following arginine administration. In my preliminary data in children with T2D, I found
a similar metabolic signature in them to that of adults with KPD. Specifically, children with T2D had lower fasting
arginine, citrulline (arginine precursor), and glutamine (citrulline precursor) levels. In this proposal, I will seek
kinetic validation of these hypothesis-generating observations to investigate the role of arginine metabolism in
pediatric T2D. My central hypothesis is that children with T2D have inadequate arginine availability (Aim 1),
leading to suboptimal β-cell function, which can be restored by exogenous arginine administration (Aim 2). If my
hypotheses are proven, arginine supplementation will play a clinically vital role in improving diabetes outcomes
in this population as a safe, low-cost, and readily available nutrient. I am uniquely suited to conduct this study
given my previous clinical and research experience, as well as my access to a large patient population, a wealth
of resources, and strong mentorship team at Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine. Through
this Career Development Award, I will gain invaluable experience in state-of-the-art kinetic techniques using a
stable isotope tracer and targeted metabolomics in children, as well as in biostatistics and data analysis."
10899938,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Health disparities science has advanced significantly over the last two decades, yet complex challenges remain.
Improving the health and health care of populations, and by extension the health of all communities, will require
a robust, transdisciplinary minority health and health disparities (MH/HD) research workforce with expertise in
health equity research methods and approaches, and experience engaging with communities and multi-sector
stakeholders. Emerging MH/HD researchers will need to become adept at designing multi-level, multi-domain
studies to address the many intersecting factors and sources that contribute to health disparities and should be
committed to engaging communities across all phases of research, from the development of research questions
to dissemination of findings to scientific and non-scientific audiences. We propose to establish the Institute for
Health Equity Research Catalyst Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, guided by an
Appreciative Inquiry framework. The Center will provide scientific training and funding support to promote the
engagement, advancement, and retention of investigators across Mount Sinai in community-informed research
focused on understanding and eliminating health disparities. A key priority will be bi-directional capacity building
in MH/HD research (investigators  community partners), and we will engage community partners across Center
programs and activities. The Center’s aims are to: (1) Build on existing strengths, expertise, and resources to
develop the Center’s governance, programmatic, and evaluation components (Administrative Core); (2) Catalyze
efforts to conduct MH/HD research to support trainees/faculty at all levels and across all disciplines through
education and training; and implement the Catalyst Scholars Pilot Project Program for early-stage investigators
planning to submit NIH K or R applications (Investigator Development Core (IDC)). Pilot projects will be required
to: focus on disparities populations, incorporate domains from the NIMHD framework, and include community-
engaged approaches; (3) Leverage our existing, expansive academic-community partnerships to convene a
Catalyst Community Board (CCB) to collaborate with the IDC on all aspects of the Center’s work (Community
Engagement and Dissemination Core/CEDC) and link Scholars to community consultants, and research and
dissemination partners. Catalyst activities for all faculty and trainees include Health Equity Research Methods
and Approaches Workshops & Seminars, a health disparities consultation service, multi-sector summits. Catalyst
Scholars will be paired with health equity mentors, have access to experts in MH/HD research approaches and
methods, and participate in research methods workshops, health equity seminars and career development
activities; they will present their work to the CCB for input at project start-up and upon completion to co-develop
novel dissemination strategies. We will evaluate all programs/activities and the Center’s overall performance to
create and share a blueprint for others to build similar centers. Catalyst will become a dynamic transdisciplinary
Center producing MH/HD research designed for rapid translation to policy, practice, and measurable impact."

10875392,"Adolescence is associated with high risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). In recent years, racial
disparities in risk for STBs have become increasingly evident, with African American and other Black-identifying
adolescents (herein, Black) experiencing higher rates of suicidal behavior than any other racial group of youth
in the U.S. Thus, there is a need for culturally appropriate interventions that target risk factors for STBs among
a growing population of racially diverse youth. Anhedonia, defined as the loss of interest or pleasure in enjoyable
or valued activities, is a core feature of depression and an independent risk factor for STBs in youth. Behavioral
Activation (BA) therapy is a cognitive behavioral intervention that directly targets anhedonia, by decreasing
avoidance and isolation behaviors, using positive reinforcement to increase engagement in valued activities and
the experience of reward. Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of BA for adolescents in the traditional
face-to-face psychotherapy format, and BA has shown promise in the few preliminary investigations that included
racially diverse youth. A key advantage of the BA model is that the focus on behavioral strategies is well suited
for adaptation to digital platforms that incorporate mobile sensing and can generate objective data on activity.
As the digital BA approach allows for real-time feedback to both users and providers on treatment goals and
behavioral targets, it offers a significant advantage over traditional face-to-face intervention. To date, no studies
have tested digital BA in a diverse study population that includes Black youth. The goal of this study, therefore,
is to tailor and test a health coach supported, digital BA intervention to target anhedonia in a diverse sample of
youth, using leading implementation science frameworks. The initial BA platform was developed by the
investigators to collect mobile accelerometer and geospatial activity data using smartphone technology that is
shared with a health coach or clinician to provide feedback and push BA intervention content via a smartphone
app. We will first use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to collect and analyze
qualitative data from focus groups with racially diverse adolescents, caregivers, providers, and administrators on
their perspectives of intervention needs and barriers and facilitators to BA intervention and implementation
strategies. Next, using human-centered design methods, we will iteratively develop and adapt the BA intervention
to the needs of racially diverse, at-risk adolescents. We will then conduct a pilot randomized trial comparing the
digitally delivered BA intervention to passive, smartphone-based activity monitoring alone. A group of 75
adolescents (35% Black), ages 12-18, with moderate depression and elevated anhedonia symptoms will be
recruited from the Signature R01. We will examine feasibility, acceptability, and impact on anhedonia (primary
target); secondary outcomes include activity, depression, and STB risk. This project will inform a larger
randomized trial of BA and has the potential to directly address a critical gap in mental health disparities research."
10875393,"The objective of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of an automated intervention delivered via a social
media-based chatbot to reduce online victimization detected in primary care and prevent depression and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among adolescents with subsyndromal depressive symptoms, with special
attention to the needs of Black and sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. Online victimization (OV) (i.e.,
disparaging remarks, symbols, images, or behaviors that inflict harm in online spaces) frequently occurs on social
media, and is directly linked to depression and suicidal ideation, which in turn associate with near-term suicide
risk. OV peaks during adolescence and it is especially prevalent among minority adolescents; over half of Black
youth experience a form of race-based online victimization involving derogation or exclusion, and SGM youth
experience OV at three times the rate of non-SGM youth. Early detection and intervention on OV has potential
to improve health during adolescence and prevent longer-term negative effects. Primary care providers (PCPs)
recognize that OV is common among their patients, but practical barriers inhibit their capacity for response.
Chatbots are software programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversation with a user via text, voice,
or video, and can be deployed on social media, SMS, or can be web-based. A chatbot that responds to OV
identified in primary care could extend PCPs’ capacity to help youth with OV through an automated intervention.
We propose to develop and evaluate SMILEY, a chatbot-delivered intervention deployed on social media that
will reduce OV frequency and intensity of distress (factors associated with depressive severity and suicidal
ideation) among online-victimized adolescents with subsyndromal depressive symptoms identified in primary
care. To inform intervention development, we will apply the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR) to the conduct of qualitative interviews to identify perceptions and preferences regarding a
chatbot-delivered intervention for online victimization. We will then use human-centered design methods to
develop, evaluate, and iterate SMILEY. We will then conduct a randomized trial comparing SMILEY vs. a brief
psychoeducational intervention among recently victimized adolescents with subsyndromal depression. Together,
these aims will provide data regarding a novel chatbot intervention that may hold promise to fill a critical gap in
services for adolescents experiencing online victimization and meaningfully advance suicide prevention for
vulnerable youth. We aim to develop an intervention that is acceptable and feasible for minoritized youth,
specifically Black and SGM youth, who are especially vulnerable to experience online victimization, thus
addressing a source of health disparities in these youth."
10875567,"PROJECT SUMMARY_PROJECT 1 
 Resilience to aging-related challenges can be the difference between physical and mental decline and a 
longer, healthier life. The increased prevalence of sleep disturbances, mood alterations and cognitive 
impairment observed in the elderly population can have substantial effects on quality of life and overall health. 
Traditional medicine systems have identified numerous botanicals that support health in older adults. Many of 
these botanicals have compelling preclinical evidence supporting their potential efficacy in humans yet few 
have been evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. This is due in part to a failure of these preclinical studies to 
focus on translationally relevant endpoints and biomarkers of efficacy. This project proposes to establish the 
experimental framework necessary to evaluate a botanical agent with promising in vitro mechanistic results in 
a mammalian system, in order to generate the data necessary to inform a well-designed clinical trial. 
 This proposal will focus on the resilience-promoting effects of the plant Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. This 
herb is used in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine as a nerve tonic and to improve cognitive function. 
Our lab and others have shown that low doses of the water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) can improve 
cognitive function in rodent models of aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Anxiolytic effects and improvement in 
insomnia as a result of administering the extract have also been reported. However, few clinical trials have 
attempted to validate these effects and each has suffered from severe methodological flaws such as lack of 
controls, being underpowered and assessing appropriate biomarkers of efficacy. 
 In this study we will address critical knowledge gaps hindering the clinical development of CAW including 
proper dosage, optimal product formulation and identification of translational biomarkers. Using aged mice we 
will explore the effects of a range of CAW doses on cognitive impairment, sleep and resilience to sleep 
deprivation, and anxiety and depression. Brain imaging, sleep phenotype, as well as circulating hormone levels 
and blood DNA methylation patterns will all be evaluated as biomarkers for target engagement. We will also 
determine the effects of constituent compounds from the CAW extract on the same behavioral endpoints in 
order to inform product formulation to be used in a clinical trial. 
 These experiments will determine the efficacy of CAW as a botanical agent to promote functional resilience 
to age-related challenges and thereby facilitate its translation to a clinical trial in older adults. Additionally, this 
study will establish a methodological platform that can be used in future studies with any promising botanical to 
provide the necessary in vivo testing to move towards clinical testing."
10875568,"PROJECT SUMMARY_PROJECT 2 
The design of valid clinical trials involving botanical dietary supplements requires the optimization of the trial 
product such that it contains sufficient levels of the active compounds. The identification of these active 
compounds therefore has to be a part of any serious study of botanicals. It is also recognized that the overall 
activity profile of a botanical may be mediated by multiple active compounds, which can act independently, 
additively, synergistically or be antagonistic to each other. While functional effects of a botanical can be 
demonstrated in vivo, initial studies on the identification of active compounds and their interaction is most 
efficiently evaluated using in vitro, ex vivo, or moderate throughput in vivo approaches. These also have the 
advantage of being mechanism based. Centella asiatica (CA) and Withania somnifera (WS) have been shown 
to affect cognition, sleep and mood and in this project, we will use primary neuron assays, brain slices, and 
Drosophila models to explore mechanisms and active compounds of CA and WS. Primary neurons will be 
used to address effects of CA and WS and their compounds on neuronal health by measuring neuronal 
arborization, antioxidant responses, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial function. In addition, we will 
determine effects on vascular tone and resilience to vasoconstriction in mouse brain slices to test whether 
these extracts promote vascular health. Drosophila models will be used to identify compounds that improve the 
age-related decline in locomotion and reactivity. We will also test effects on a described depression-like state 
in Drosophila, using courtship as an assay, and we will measure Serotonin levels in neuronal subpopulations 
identified as mediating this depression-like state. Furthermore, Drosophila will be used to determine effects on 
sleep patterns, which are also altered by age in flies and mammals. The cellular and molecular pathways 
regulating sleep are well known in Drosophila and we can therefore also investigate whether CA and/or WS 
promotes healthy sleep patterns by altering neuronal activity and neurotransmitter signaling in the neuronal 
populations that promote or suppress sleep. Besides Serotonin and Aceteylcholine, this includes GABA. To 
expand these studies to the mouse model, we will measure neuronal activity in mouse brain slices and address 
whether treatment with CA and/or WS affects GABA signaling (using GABA inhibitors). Together, these studies 
will identify active compounds in CA and WS and they will show whether they support health and resilience by 
promoting cognition, sleep and/or mood. In addition, they will provide insights into mechanism that may 
mediate these effects, like improving neuronal activity, decreasing oxidative stress and/or promoting 
mitochondrial function. Future studies can then confirm these effects in an in vivo mouse model and eventually 
provide the basis for testing active compounds in humans."
10875569,"PROJECT SUMMARY_BOTANICAL CORE
Many botanicals are touted to have beneficial effects on cognition, mood, sleep quality and other functions that 
are diminished during aging. An abiding challenge with scientific studies involving botanicals is the complexity 
and variability of their chemical profile as well as ambiguities in the identity and species homogeneity of 
botanical preparations. The proposed Botanical Dietary Supplement Research Center (BDSRC) will perform 
studies critical to future clinical trials of “Botanicals enhancing neurological and functional resilience in aging”. 
Based on public/health/relevance, public interest and exciting preliminary data this BDSRC will focus on 
developing and evaluating Centella asiatica (CA; “gotu kola”) and Withania somnifera (WS; “ashwagandha”) as 
botanical dietary supplements that show high promise to promote neurological and functional resilience in an 
aging population. The Botanical Core (B-Core) will support the research projects of the BDSRC by (1) 
providing authenticated and well characterized CA and WS derived materials for use in the BDSRC’s research 
as well as by any CARBON collaborations, will source plant material, authenticate and document its macro-, 
scopic and chemical characteristics, and produce, characterize and provide derivatives (extracts, fractions and 
compounds) of CA and WS to the BDSRCs research project and CARBON collaborators. The B-Core will 
develop, advance and apply analytical methods based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass 
spectrometry (MS) for the quantification of active compounds in CA and WS both in plant materials and in 
biological samples (plasma, brain) derived from animals treated with the botanicals. (3) The B-core will provide 
high content fingerprints of botanical extracts based on high resolution mass spectrometry-enabled 
metabolomics techniques. And, (4) the B-Core together with biostatistics support (provided by the A-Core) will 
conduct chemometric correlation approaches to identify active compounds, where preparations of CA and WS 
are fingerprinted by LC-HRMS and evaluated in a series of bioassays conducted under Project 2. In addition, 
the B-Core will participate in a cross-component effort to discover unknown biological effects of CA botanicals 
by evaluating gene expression and/or metabolomics data from primary neurons (Project 2) and brains of 
animals (Project 1) treated with CA or derivatives, and attempt integration of the “omics’ findings under the 
guidance of a Bioinformatician (A-Core). The work of the B-Core will therefore be essential to, and synergistic 
with, activities of the other components of this BDSRC and with other CARBON collaborators."
10875570,"PROJECT SUMMARY_ADMINISTRATIVE CORE 
The Administrative Core is aligned to support the primary goal of the U19 Botanical Dietary Supplement 
Research Center (BDSRC) on “Botanicals enhancing neurological and functional resilience in aging”, which is 
to perform research critical to the design of valid clinical trials of botanicals showing high potential to support 
neurological and functional resilience during aging. A multidisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators, 
providing expertise in a wide range of scientific disciplines has been assembled to address this goal. Research 
activities will be based primarily at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and Oregon State University 
(OSU), with significant contributions from the University of Mississippi (UMiss) and the company Oregon’s Wild 
Harvest (OWH). The BDSRC comprises an Administrative Core, a Botanical Core and two Research Projects. 
The Administrative Core’s mission is to ensure the success of the BDSRC by supporting collaborative 
interactions between the BDSRC’s components and with other CARBON centers, provide direction and 
guidance for the activities of the BDSRC, and ensure rigorous scientific standards in all of its research 
activities. The Administrative Core will be led by the Project Director and staffed by an Administrator. A Data 
Management and Biostatistics group will be included within this Core to support the research activities of the 
Botanical Core and two Research Projects. Critical components for the management will be the Executive 
Committee (EXC) comprised of component leads and the Internal Steering Committee (ISC). The 
Administrative Core, in conjunction with the NIH sponsor, will organize an External Advisory Committee (ESC) 
that will meet annually to review the progress of the BDSRC and provide oversight and guidance. This Core 
will also be responsible for disseminating information regarding the BDSRC’s mission, activities and 
achievements to a wider audience through a dedicated website, and provide funds to cover journal publication 
fees and costs of attending national and international conferences, including the annual CARBON meeting. An 
important role of the Administrative Core will be to promote the training activities of the BDSRC. The Core will 
announce research opportunities available at the BDSRC, connect potential trainees to faculty mentors, and 
manage the funds associated with the research projects."
10875633,"Cancer Research Career Enhancement and Related Activities
 Project Summary
 Both innovation and implementation of cancer solutions requires development of a highly trained cancer-
focused workforce. To promote this objective, the PCCR tightly integrates sponsorship of a diverse array of
educational and professional development activities within its broad portfolio of research objectives. The
institutional home of PCCR, Purdue, presents an outstanding opportunity to further grow this cancer workforce.
Purdue is a leading R1 institution with an exceptional diversity of research expertise and a deep commitment to
its education mission. Purdue sponsors numerous programs that explicitly promote education and training. It
similarly supports many programs that promote professional development at all training levels, from
undergraduate to faculty. These programs, however, are typically not framed in a cancer-relevant context. In
order to have the greatest impact on the cancer workforce of the future, an overarching goal of the PCCR with
regards to education and professional development is to provide a cancer focus to existing Purdue-sponsored
activities that would not exist in the absence of the Center and thereby leverage these activities for a cancer-
relevant purpose. Similarly, by promoting cancer-relevant aspects of these educational and professional
development programs, the PCCR promotes opportunities available in the cancer research field that many of
the outstanding faculty, students and staff at Purdue would otherwise be unfamiliar with and, thereby, recruits
these individuals to the fight against cancer. In short, the PCCR both promotes its own programs and coordinates
with various Purdue academic and administrative units to explicitly leverage Purdue's abundant institutional
resources in order to have the largest impact on cancer-focused education and professional development.
Initiatives addressing education and professional development are grouped into four themes: 1) Building a
cancer-focused community of practice to facilitate interdisciplinary training that exploits the diversity of research
expertise at Purdue; 2) Promoting faculty development and helping to recruit top-tier basic scientists into cancer-
related research; 3) Promoting graduate student education and training by designing PCCR-sponsored activities
such that graduate student education and professional development are built into the experience; and 4)
Promoting undergraduate opportunities and thereby shape career paths and intentions of Purdue's extensive
undergraduate population. Specific examples of PCCR activities/programs include: 1) a bioinformatics training
program that targets graduate students; 2) a Continuing Umbrella of Research Experience (CURE)-funded
summer research program for graduate students who are underrepresented minorities; 3) a program for faculty
and postdocs in the physical sciences that promotes cancer-related research and embeds them in a clinical
setting; 4) training of graduate students to use PCCR-sponsored shared resources; and 5) interdisciplinary
training for graduate students and faculty via a cancer journal club. By intentionally embracing training within its
discovery mission, the PCCR is fostering both the innovations of today and the innovators of tomorrow."
10875637,"Transgenic and Genome Editing Facility Shared Resource (TGEF-SR)
 Project Summary
 The ability to introduce foreign genes into the germ line, to selectively ablate endogenous genes, or to
genetically edit specific genes in the mouse and rat genome, has proven to be one of the most powerful
experimental tools available for understanding specific genetic requirements for tumor promoting regulatory
pathways. In the area of oncology, genetically engineered mouse models have revealed the molecular pathways
by which proto-oncogenes predispose cells to develop malignant tumors or how tumor suppressor genes
maintain normal growth control. Transgenic strategies have also revolutionized the way we approach the
complex problems associated with carcinogenesis, including the development of novel therapeutic intervention
strategies. To support cancer research and utilization of this powerful technology, the Purdue University Center
for Cancer Research (PCCR) Transgenic and Genome Editing Facility Shared Resource (TGEF-SR) was
established in 1998. The PCCR's TGEF-SR is a state-of-the-art facility that offers a large number of services to
the Center membership, including the creation of transgenic, knock-out, and gene-edited mouse and rat models
that can assist in dissecting transcriptional, signaling, and environmental influences on tumor initiation,
progression and metastasis. Additionally, these models have been instrumental in dissecting the importance of
immune cells and stromal infiltrates to tumor progression, and have helped to identify novel cancer stem cell
lineages that are often resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics. The TGEF-SR provides a wide range of
services to the PCCR community that can be divided into 2 main categories, genome editing and assisted
reproduction. The Resource offers several options for gene editing, including: (i) traditional transgenic
technology to produce animals with exogenous gene sequences randomly inserted into the genome; (ii)
CRISPR-mediated knock-outs to delete small or large, targeted pieces of DNA, resulting in gene disruption or
inactivation; (iii) CRISPR-mediated, targeted, homology-directed knock-ins of DNA sequences to produce subtle
changes in gene sequence; (iv) insertion of large cassettes or entire gene replacements; and (v) traditional
knock-outs produced by injection of gene-targeted ES cells into blastocysts. The last few years has seen a major
shift towards CRISPR-mediated projects, with 31 CRISPR/cas9 projects, in both rats and mice, completed in a
3-year period. In support of genetically engineered rodent colonies, the TGEF-SR also offers services to assist
with the maintenance of mouse colonies and to overcome difficulties associated with breeding challenging lines,
including re-derivation by embryo transfer to import new lines from outside facilities, embryo and sperm
cryopreservation to preserve the valuable gene-edited lines generated, and in vitro fertilization to overcome
breeding problems or allow rapid expansion of a line. The TGEF-SR is poised to continue offering excellent
services to rapidly move cancer models towards effective patient care."
10875638,"Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FC-SR)
 Project Summary
 The Purdue Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FC-SR) provides advanced cell and particle analysis, cell
sorting and single cell genomic capabilities to members of the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research
(PCCR). The FC-SR has made major improvements to the facility in terms of equipment, expert personnel and
data analysis software. This has allowed the Shared Resource to expand its efforts to provide more cancer
researchers with economical and effective access to- and training in- the highly specialized and increasingly
sophisticated technologies driving modern advances in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
 Flow cytometry is an analytical tool that uses optical measures to allow users to identify and quantitate cellular
features, organelles or structural components. When combined with sorting capabilities, users can identify and
isolate single cells that have specific properties or express specific molecules, which can then be further
examined and characterized. In cancer research, where the identification and characterization of unique, specific
cells with cancer-like characteristics is critical, flow cytometry and cell sorting are vital tools for today's cancer
researcher. Purdue's FC-SR provides a broad range of services that supported 40 PCCR investigators' research
projects and trained 113 PCCR students and postdoctoral fellows between July 2015 and January 2018.
 The FC-SR, located in the Bindley Bioscience Center (BBC) of Discovery Park, has continued to expand its
technical expertise and instrument capabilities. In 2015, with support from an NIH S10 Shared Instrument Grant,
the FC-SR obtained a 5-laser, 18-color BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer designed to complement the workhorse
5-laser BD FACS Aria Cell Sorter. The growing number of new cancer research faculty at Purdue created an
increased demand for live cell sorting of mouse and human cells in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. To meet
this need, in 2018, the PCCR contributed to the purchase of two additional state-of-the-art cell sorters: a 5-laser
BD FACS Aria Fusion and a 4-laser, high-speed BC MoFlo Astrios. The PCCR was also instrumental in the
development of the FC-SR's single-cell, genome and transcriptome capabilities, through the acquisition of a
Fluidigm C1 system and a 10x Chromium system. The data analysis capabilities of the facility have also
continued to grow, with the addition of FCS Express and FlowJo site licenses.
 Perhaps the most important resource provided by the FC-SR is the expertise that the staff shares. Many of
the FC-SR's clients have little, if any, experience conducting cytometry analysis or designing cell sorting or
single-cell genomics experiments. In the absence of the FC-SR and its experienced staff, these investigators
would have tremendous difficulty in generating cytometry data necessary for competitive external funding."

 Project Summary
 The Computational Genomics Shared Resource (CG-SR) incorporates both bioinformatics and genomics
expertise for the Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR). The greatest utility of the CG-SR is in data
analysis. Since 2015, the CG-SR has analyzed dozens of projects, of which the majority are bulk and single-cell
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), whole genome sequencing (WGS), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq), whole genome CRISPR-Cas 9 screens, and bisulphite sequencing. Since its inception in 2015, the
bioinformatics services provided by the CG-SR has supported 45 PCCR investigators' research projects (23 in
the last year) from all three of PCCR's Research Programs. The analyses performed by the CG-SR are highly
customized and tailored to individual groups, providing PCCR members with fast, reliable, and high-quality data
analysis. The incorporated genomics consulting services provide equal access to all PCCR members and have
served 53 PCCR members in the last year. The CG-SR aids in experimental design, ensuring that the
experiments carried out by PCCR members are feasible, provide adequate power, and follow experimental
guidelines suggested in the scientific literature. The CG-SR regularly participates in writing grants and
manuscripts with PCCR members. In this way, the PCCR members are supported by the CG-SR from the initial
stages of a project, all the way through publication. Finally, the CG-SR provides both formal and informal
bioinformatics training and support for PCCR members. The CG-SR currently mentors four trainees (three
graduate students and one undergraduate student) and prepares both computationally and biologically inclined
graduate students to bridge the gap between computational and biological disciplines. The CG-SR aided in
designing and teaching a course to encourage life scientists to use high-performance computing resources on
campus and to teach them the basic skills that are necessary for such work. The CG-SR regularly gives talks
and workshops on campus, and provides group and one-on-one training for labs, students, postdocs, and faculty
who wish to learn to perform their own data analysis."

 In the classical paradigm for cervical cancer, keratinocytes are infected with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV)
genomes which become integrated (“iHPV”) into human chromosomes, and facilitate progression to invasive
cancer. However, the concept of HPV integration is not routinely used in clinical practice. Intriguingly, we and
others have shown that at least 25% of HPV-positive (HPV+) cancers harbor only “extrachromosomal” HPV
(“eHPV”), and there are reports of “hybrid” tumors with both eHPV and iHPV. We have also shown that there is
no difference in the distribution of clinical stage between patients with eHPV versus iHPV tumors, even though
patients with eHPV tumors have better clinical outcomes. Based on this, we posit that eHPV and iHPV tumors
have distinct molecular drivers and may require different treatment strategies.
 Investigation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cervical cancer remains highly significant
despite the advances in screening and vaccination. The successes of these prevention programs in the “West”
have not been replicated in resource-poor countries with the greatest disease burden, and even in the United
States, disparities in vaccine uptake still exist with millions still at risk of developing cervical cancer.
We were the first to discover r
ecurrent somatic ERK2-E322K mutations in primary cancers (8% o
f
cervical cancer). We have now shown that ERK2-E322K mutations are 9 times mo
re likely to occur in eHPV
tumors compared with iHPV tumors. We have also identified specific viral spliced transcripts (VSTs) that
distinguish eHPV and iHPV primary HPV16-positive cervical tumors, and we have shown using VSTs that the
expression of HPV E5, which is known to promote angiogenesis, is a hallmark of eHPV status.
 Our overall hypotheses are that eHPV-tumors and iHPV-tumors have distinct host and viral genomic
classification markers, that patients with eHPV tumors respond better to therapy with the angiogenesis inhibitor
bevacizumab than those with iHPV tumors, and that ERK2-E322K mutation enhances the growth of eHPV
tumors more than iHPV tumors. Our specific aims to: (i) characterize host molecular markers that distinguish
eHPV-tumors from iHPV-tumors, (ii) investigate the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of HPV viral spliced
transcripts in cervical cancer, and (iii) investigate the effect of ERK2E322K mutation on the growth of eHPV
versus iHPV tumors.
 We expect our research contribution to be significant and impactful for patient diagnosis and treatment.
We will p. rovide translational utility for HPV integration (or the lack thereof) by identifying host and viral markers
for the classification of eHPV and iHPV tumors, and for treatment-related patient stratification."

 Molecular & Genetic Problem: Lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance is due to diacylglyceride
(DAG)-induced protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) activation leading to inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase [4, 5]. However, nonobese hyperandrogenic (HA) female mice displayed androgen-specific hepatic
insulin resistance indicating a lipid-independent pathogenic mechanism [3]. Additionally, high fructose diets
(HFrD) compared to high fat diets (HFD) display differing mechanisms of insulin resistance, where high
fructose impairs glucokinase and glycogen synthase but high fat lowers p-AKT [6]. Ketohexokinase (KHK, also
known as liver fructokinase) is required for HFrD-induced metabolic dysfunction [7].
 The Overall Aim is to establish that differing causes of insulin resistance display crosstalk between cellular,
molecular, and genetic mechanisms. I will develop 3 mouse models of hepatic insulin resistance: high
androgen (HA)-induced, HFD-induced, and HFrD-induced. Using various hepatic specific knockout (KO) mice
to eliminate the function of certain pathways (androgen receptor (AR-KO), ketohexokinase (KHK-KO), and
protein kinase C (PKC-KO)), I will examine the intersecting pathogenic mechanisms unique to each of the
three insulin resistant models.
 Expected Outcome: I hypothesize that each model of insulin resistance (HA, HFD, and HFrD) will contain its
own unique mechanistic aspect with varying aspects of crosstalk. Thus, suggesting the movement towards
targeted therapeutic interventions based on the type of insulin resistance."

Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we have produced the first adult mouse
retinal volume that spans the entire depth of the retina, from photoreceptors to the nerve fiber
layer at nanometer resolution to map mouse retinal cell types and their microcircuits. There are
currently no other mouse retinal volumes that encompass both the inner and outer retina.
Cellular ultrastructure and synaptic detail are excellent. Based on this volume, our goal is to
provide the community with the most complete first-draft connectome of the mouse retina
available anywhere within about a year. To achieve this, we propose to use Scalableminds
Voxelytics services to stitch together and register the images, then segment the entire volume
and detect ribbon and conventional synapses. These services will accelerate the availability of a
fully segmented volume of the mouse retina that will greatly benefit ongoing retinal circuitry
projects as well as facilitate new discoveries by the community."

Itch is described as an unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire to scratch. Although acute scratching is the
protective mechanism to remove irritants from the skin, chronic itch is debilitating. In addition, chronic itch is
widespread and very difficult to treat because of a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Therefore, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of chronic itch toward
the development of novel and effective therapies. Despite great progress in the past few decades in unraveling
the role of membrane bound G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels, especially transient receptor
potential (TRP) channels in the generation of itch sensation at the levels of primary sensory neurons and spinal
cord, much remains unknown about how the cells and molecules in the skin contribute to the production and
regulation of chronic itch other than the mediation of allergic itch by mast cells.
Pilot studies showed that skin-specific knockout of Piezo2 severely reduced the spontaneous scratching in
multiple mouse models of chronic itch. Moreover, the reduction of spontaneous itch in mice subjected to
experimental dry skin is correlated with a loss of mechanically evoked C-fiber firing mediated by the TRPV1-
positive C-mechanoreceptors. We thus hypothesized that Piezo2-Merkel cell signaling is required for the
generation of spontaneous itch under chronic itch conditions by driving the TRPV1-positive C-
mechanoreceptors under chronic itch conditions. In this grant proposal we will: 1) Use unique genetic
approaches to investigate in vivo functions of the mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels and mechanosensory
Merkel cells in mediating spontaneous itch three well-established mouse models of chronic itch; 2)
Demonstrate that miswiring occurs between the Merkel cells and the pruriceptive C-type mechanoreceptor to
promote spontaneous itch in chronic itch mice, thereby providing the cellular and molecular basis for chronic
itch in multiple mouse models of chronic itch.
Our findings will provide a major contribution to our general understanding of how Piezo2 channels and Merkel
cells affect itch signaling in the skin, and undoubtedly lead to new therapeutic approaches for treating chronic
itch."
10898041,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In the time it takes to read this application, 20 older adults (age≥65 years) will die of pneumonia in the
United States. Annually over 500,000 older adults received treatment in emergency departments (ED) for
pneumonia. Unfortunately, ED physicians cannot accurately diagnose pneumonia in older adults because of
atypical symptoms, chest x-ray inaccuracy, comorbidities, failure of pulmonary clinical prediction rules
established with younger adults, and poor accuracy of available biomarkers. Emergency physician’s inability to
diagnose pneumonia in older adults leads to delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, worsening infection,
longer lengths of stay (6.6 days vs. 5.4), and mortality.
 Pneumonia can be caused by bacterial and viral pathogens alone or in combination. Bacterial
pneumonia alone causes the adverse outcomes and faces the diagnostic challenges just described. The
presence of viral pneumonia further complicates diagnosis. Bacterial and viral co-infection in all adults increase
odds of death by 2.1 with expected greater deleterious effects on older adults. Unfortunately, when viral
sources are detected our current diagnostic approach fails to reliably identify bacterial sources in the event of
co-infections. This can lead to inappropriate care and highlights the importance of ensuring fast, accurate
diagnosis of both bacterial and viral pneumonia.
 Unfortunately, available tests (serum, imaging) and patient presentation (symptoms, exam, and history)
are unreliable for diagnosing pneumonia in older adult ED patients. Our previous results reveal that novel tests
may improve diagnostic accuracy of pneumonia (antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and monocyte distribution
width [MDW]). AMPs are a part of the innate immune system and respond in minutes to bacteria and viruses.
Monocyte distribution width measures the distribution of size of leukocytes and increases in ED sepsis.
 This project seeks to build on previous investigations to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pneumonia
in older adult ED patients with the long-term goal of improving clinical care and decreasing the morbidity and
mortality associated with pneumonia. Aim #1 examines the potential for novel tests (AMPs and MDW) to
diagnose pneumonia alone and in combination with patient presentation/symptoms and existing diagnostic
studies. This aim will consider pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens, viral pathogens and the combination
separately to create and determine the accuracy of a diagnostic pathway. Aim #2 will employ group concept
mapping guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework to engage emergency physicians to identify facilitators
and barriers to implementation of a diagnostic pathway in emergency medicine to inform future studies. Aim #3
pilots the Aim #1 diagnostic pathway. If successful, this proposal will produce a diagnostic pathway for
pneumonia in older adult ED patients and provide the groundwork for a successful validation and
implementation study of this diagnostic pathway."

One million adults in the United States receive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure (ARF)
annually and up to 80% of them develop delirium during their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Delirium is
associated with post-ICU cognitive and physical impairments. Delirium has no effective treatment due to
our limited understanding of the pathophysiology connecting ARF and delirium which share a
proinflammatory cytokine state. The systemic release of cytokines, ongoing alveolar injury, and
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may connect ARF and delirium. We hypothesize that
increased biomarkers of ROS are associated with increased cognitive and physical function impairments
in critically ill older adults. To test our hypothesis, we propose a preliminary, prospective study titled
Reactive Oxygen Species in Respiratory Failure, Delirium and Post-ICU Cognitive Impairment. We will
measure levels of ROS using samples obtained from 80 critically ill, mechanically ventilated older adults,
and follow these patients for 24 months. Blood samples and cognition and physical function assessments
will be conducted at multiple time-points to accomplish our study aims. The primary aim is to measure the
relationship between biomarkers of ROS and post-ICU mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in critically ill older adults with acute respiratory failure. The
secondary aims are to measure the relationship among biomarkers of oxidative injury and delirium
duration and severity in critically ill older adults with ARF; and to measure the relationship among post-
ICU biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and post-ICU MCI and ADRD.
The proposed career development plan integrates coursework, experiential training and mentorship in
aging, and the conduct of prospective clinical research. The candidate will also learn leadership skills,
participate in national meetings, and benefit from a well-established and highly successful
multidisciplinary mentorship panel with a track record of success in training junior investigators. The
candidate’s academic environment includes the highly acclaimed resources and faculty of Indiana
University School of Medicine, the distinguished Indiana University Center for Aging Research,
Regenstrief Institute, and the NIH-funded Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI).
This career development award will guarantee protected time that will be necessary to advance the
candidate’s career in studying outcomes for older adults. Knowledge gained during the award will
improve scientific understanding of the nexus between ARF, delirium, and ICU-acquired cognitive and
physical impairment, and prepare for R01 submissions to further study oxidative stress in aging."

10897957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With an increasing aging population showing memory declines, many of which remain untreatable, finding ways
to reduce prospective memory failures is critical for healthy aging. Prospective memory is necessary for
maintaining independence with increased age and failures of prospective memory are associated with a variety
of health consequences and difficulties in daily activities. For example, over 55% of older adults do not adhere
to medication instructions, leading to the annual hospitalization of over 200,000 older adults due to adverse drug
reactions and billions of dollars annually in avoidable direct healthcare costs. Offloading information onto external
sources, such as setting an alarm to take medication, provides an easy and effective means to mitigate age-
related prospective memory declines. However, a lack of basic knowledge about the cognitive and metacognitive
processes underlying offloading decisions presents barriers to effective implementation. The purpose of this
proposal is to address these gaps in knowledge by examining the role of offloading during prospective memory
encoding, storage, and retrieval. This will be accomplished by combining behavioral and physiological (pupillary)
measures to examine how and when age-related breakdowns in prospective memory occur (Aim 1) and
examining how strategy training can be used to ameliorate age declines in remembering (Aim 2). The results will
provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for identifying the mechanisms underlying prospective memory,
the source of age-related declines in prospective memory, and the efficacy of cognitive and strategy training as
a memory enhancement technique. The long-term goal of this research is to develop the capacity to identify who
will benefit most from strategy training interventions and which specific strategies should be targeted. Individually
tailored treatment options will result in increased ability to improve cognitive functioning for those experiencing
age-related memory decline. This work is innovative in its novel use of pupillometry to examine cognitive
processes not otherwise observable with standard behavioral measures and through the development of an
online training tool to improve everyday prospective memory. The findings will be significant for understanding
treatment options to improve prospective memory functioning in younger adults, older adults, and individuals
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

The 2024 Synaptic Transmission Gordon Conference will bring together international leaders and rising stars,
creating a diverse, inclusive, dynamic forum to communicate, contemplate and advance our understanding of
the most pressing and fascinating current topics in synapse biology. Synapses are the fundamental site of
communication between neurons. Synapses form, break, grow and shrink during development and throughout
life in response to changes in the external environment and changes to internal states. Diseases and disorders
ranging from Alzheimer’s and ALS to schizophrenia and intellectual disability are associated (primary cause or
secondary effects) with synaptic dysfunction and/or degeneration. Yet, the means by which disease directly
intersects with synaptic biology remains largely unknown. The long-term goals of the Synaptic Transmission
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) reflect these challenges. We aim to (1) to define the fundamental
molecular and cellular mechanisms that achieve synapse specification, connectivity and diversity, (2) to define
mechanisms responsible for synaptic plasticity on scales that range from milliseconds to hours and years, and
understand how these modalities are integrated during the complex neural computations underlying behavior
(3) to explore the interface of synapses and disease, with the goal of discovering novel therapeutic avenues to
treat a broad spectrum of neurological disease and psychiatric disorders."
10896490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria is an important global cause of morbidity and mortality. Most of this disease burden falls on children
and pregnant women and is caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum. The signs and symptoms of
human malaria result from the exponential expansion of parasite biomass that occurs during asexual
replication of parasites in human red blood cells. During this clinically important blood stage, P. falciparum
parasites divide by schizogony – a process wherein components for several daughter cells are produced
within a common cytoplasm prior to a complex and synchronized cytokinesis known as segmentation.
Cytokinesis via segmentation is highly divergent from the process of cell division in human cells. The
generation of the invasive daughter parasites, known as merozoites, occurs with high fidelity, ensuring that
each daughter has a single nucleus and the required organelles. The fundamental molecular mechanisms
that facilitate segmentation are incompletely understand, and this is a significant knowledge gap.
Successful segmentation requires two parasite-specific structures, the inner membrane complex (IMC) and
the basal complex. The IMC is a double lipid bilayer with associated proteins that, together with an
underlying cytoskeletal network, dictates parasite shape and rigidity. The basal complex is a group of
proteins at the posterior (i.e., basal) end of the IMC. This multi-protein molecular machine is essential for
parasite cell division and is hypothesized to facilitate proper biogenesis of the IMC, likely to contribute to cell
shape, and to mediate the final abscission step of cytokinesis. In the current proposal, we will move
stepwise towards a molecular understanding of basal complex function. We have a high-confidence list of
basal complex components, and our preliminary data demonstrate that individual proteins define
subcompartments within the complex and dynamically join and depart the complex. In the first aim, we will
utilize high-resolution live-cell time lapse microscopy to determine the precise order of assembly and
disassembly of the basal complex. In the second aim, we will utilize super-resolution ultrastructure
expansion microscopy to localize individual proteins into subcompartments of the basal complex and
proximity labeling to identify novel components within these compartments. In the third aim, we evaluate the
requirement for the remaining basal complex components for segmentation and determine the minimal core
of proteins that are essential for basal complex function. In summary, the basal complex is essential for
asexual replication of P. falciparum, is insufficiently understood, and is not targeted by any current
therapeutics. The studies in this proposal will narrow the significant knowledge gap around the molecular
mechanisms of basal complex function and may identify important targets for future antimalarials."

Over the past decade, advances in early detection and diagnosis have begun to reveal the vast complexity of
the primary etiologies that drive pathogenic cardiac remodeling and result in end-stage heart disease, an
enduring health burden in the United States and throughout the world. While current treatments focus on the
late stages of disease, where morphology, function and outcomes are often highly similar, there is growing
evidence that improving patient care and management will require coupling early diagnoses to specific,
targeted therapies that alter the natural history of these progressive and often devastating disorders. The
development of these targeted therapies will require new ideas, new methodologies, and new collaborations
between basic and clinical scientists from disparate fields of cardiovascular research. The 2024 Gordon
Research Conference (GRC) on Cardiac Regulatory Mechanisms is the premier conference centered on the
fundamental, basic mechanisms that control normal cardiac function and how these systems are precisely
altered in the context of pathogenic processes, resulting in a broad range of cardiovascular disease states. The
2024 GRC and its integrated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is organized by and for early career scientists
and will focus on how the discovery of fundamental molecular processes can be leveraged for therapeutic
intervention using approaches that encompass multiple levels of experimental resolution, hence the subtitle
“Translating Fundamental Discoveries into Novel Therapeutics”. The subjects included in the program cover
the latest advances in understanding cardiac function and dysfunction in the areas of heart failure, cardiac
regeneration, inflammation, inter-organ crosstalk, calcium regulation, metabolic regulation, and myocellular
structural dynamics. The main objectives of the GRC/GRS are 1) to disseminate the latest information and
technological advances in Cardiac Regulatory Mechanisms pertinent to novel therapeutic interventions for
heart disease; 2) to engage, motivate, and mentor the next generation of basic and physician-scientists in
cardiovascular research and 3) to stimulate collaboration and multidisciplinary communication in the inclusive
environment unique to the Gordon Research Conferences, which features rigorous discussions of unpublished,
controversial, or paradigm–challenging data."

Transcription factor (TF) dysfunction is a direct cause of multiple inherited ocular diseases. Understanding
the precise cellular and molecular functions of each individual ocular TFs is key towards understanding the
mechanistic foundation for mammalian ocular development and the development of therapies to manage
human congenital eye diseases. PAX6 encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding TF that plays pivotal
roles in the earliest stages of lens and retinal development. Genetic data of the microphthalmia-
anophthalmia-coloboma (MAC) syndrome identified prominent roles of TFs PAX6 and SOX2 and retinoic
acid (RA) signaling. Heterozygous mutations of PAX6 such as G18W, A33P, N50K and R128C, alter
DNA-binding of mutated PAX6 proteins and cause variable aniridia. Nonsense R317X mutation causes
haploinsufficiency. Heterozygous R74P and H101R SOX2 mutations cause microphthalmia and
anophthalmia, respectively. Homozygous mutations in PAX6 cause anophthalmia. This application seeks
to elucidate abnormal functions of PAX6 in aniridia and MAC syndrome to test the overarching hypothesis
that specific mutations of PAX6 and SOX2 disrupt critical functions of these TFs during early stages of eye
development, including RA-signaling. These early stages of human eye development, including formation
of lens and retinal progenitor cells, will be modelled in iPS-derived organoids pioneered by our laboratory.
Three mouse models of Pax6 will be used to directly compare human and mouse transcriptomic and
chromatin data. Preliminary studies include functional analyses of four missense and a nonsense PAX6
mutations in cell cultures to study haploinsufficiency, analysis of lens formation in Pax6+/lacZ embryos,
genome-wide Pax6-binding in the retina, and disrupted brain development in Leca4 (N50K) and Leca2
(R128C) Pax6 null mouse mutants. Aim 1 will uncover the molecular mechanisms of how PAX6 missense
and nonsense (R317X) mutations disrupt the early steps of human eye development. Aim 2 will elucidate
Pax6-dependent gene control in mouse optic cup stage embryos. Aim 3 will determine function of SOX2,
PAX6/SOX2 functional overlaps, and vitamin A’s potential role in “compensating” PAX6 R317X haplo-
insufficiency. These results will reveal how individual PAX6 mutations alter gene control in multiple ocular
tissues, i.e. in the lens and retinal progenitor cells, identify in vivo PAX6- and SOX2-binding requirements
in human cells, compare function of N50K and R128C mutated proteins between human and mouse,
identify candidate genes driving cataract, glaucoma, foveal hypoplasia and other diseases within the
variable aniridia phenotypes, and mechanistically link PAX6 and SOX2 with RA signaling. The successful
completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms and gene control by PAX6 and
SOX2 in ocular development and provide a basis for the development of therapies to manage aniridia and
potentially other human inherited eye diseases."

Myxomatous valve disease (MVD) is among the most common types of cardiac valve disease and carries
significant morbidity and mortality, leading to regurgitation and valve prolapse. While most of the research efforts
at understanding MVD pathogenesis have focused on mouse models of syndromic MVD, the majority of MVD
patients lack known syndromic mutations and present later in life, suggesting that MVD is more often acquired
and likely influenced by environmental factors. We have recently demonstrated that hemodynamic shear forces
direct cardiac valve development through transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4, but the role of hemodynamic
forces and KLF2/4 in regulating mature valve homeostasis remains unexplored. Preliminary studies indicate that
genetic inducible loss of KLF2/4 from valve endothelial cells (VEC) results in a phenotype highly concordant with
human MVD. Importantly, similar MVD pathology results from transplanted hearts with loss of blood flow across
the mitral valve. Together, these results suggest a role for hemodynamic forces and KLF2/4 as critical regulators
of valve homeostasis. This proposal aims to characterize the role of hemodynamic forces in maintaining valve
homeostasis (Aim 1), identify specific targets of VEC KLF2/4 (Aim 2) and determine whether TGFß/Smad
signaling is a shared requirement for myxomatous pathology in models of both syndromic and acquired MVD
(Aim 3)."

Overview: The goal of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a cognitive-behaviorally based psychosocial
intervention (BMT-CARE) compared to usual care for caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HCT) and to identify critical facilitators and barriers for intervention implementation and adoption.
Background: Family and friend caregivers of patients undergoing HCT experience substantial distress before
HCT as they cope with the uncertainty of the patient’s prognosis, and the patient endures significant toxicities.
Additionally, as the primary caregivers of patients during the immediate post-HCT course, caregivers often man-
age a demanding schedule of appointments and experience substantial caregiving burden interfering with their
personal lives and responsibilities. Since these individuals experience intense and specialized caregiving burden
which persists before, during, and for several months after HCT, there is a critical need to develop a population-
specific intervention to address their needs across the transplant continuum. However, scalable interventions to
support caregivers throughout the patients’ HCT course are lacking. We completed a single center pilot trial of
BMT-CARE to address the needs of caregivers prior to, during, and after HCT, which entailed six one-hour visits
with a trained study therapist during the HCT course. We demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and
preliminarily led to clinically significant improvement in caregivers’ quality of life, mood, caregiving burden, self-
efficacy, and coping skills. Thus, this was the first trial to establish both the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
BMT-CARE for improving outcomes of caregivers of HCT recipients.
Research Plan: We propose to conduct a hybrid type I multi-site randomized effectiveness-implementation trial
in 400 caregiver-patient dyads undergoing HCT to test the efficacy of BMT-CARE vs. usual care for improving
caregiver QOL, caregiving burden, mood, coping, and self-efficacy. We will also examine the impact of BMT-
CARE on patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Finally, we will identify critical facilitators and
barriers for BMT-CARE implementation and adoption using the RE-AIM QuEST mixed-methods framework.
Environment: This project will be conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), University of Ala-
bama at Birmingham, and Moffitt Cancer Center, which collectively conduct 350-400 transplants per year. These
sites have the supportive oncology research expertise and infrastructure, transplant experience, and processes
to conduct this trial. The MGH research team has the expertise in developing and testing multi-site palliative and
supportive care interventions for patients with hematologic malignancies and their caregivers to ensure the suc-
cessful implementation and evaluation of BMT-CARE across study sites.
Relevance of Research: This project will establish the essential foundation for a future implementation and
dissemination trial of BMT-CARE into clinical practice."

Caregivers frequently use infant-directed speech (IDS), commonly known as “parentese”, when speaking to
young children. Compared to adult-directed speech (ADS), IDS is typically characterized by greater pitch
variation, longer duration, and louder volume. IDS facilitates early language development in typically developing
(TD) children. However, we do not know whether the facilitative effect of IDS on language learning can be
generalized to clinical populations such as autistic children given that core autism features (e.g., sensory and
social communication differences) may interact with how they process and learn from IDS. Most autistic children
do not reach age-appropriate language ability even if they receive timely early intervention. Determining if autistic
children can learn language from IDS, a common way language input is provided to young children, is a critical
first step toward understanding whether language input needs to be adjusted to optimize their language
development. The overall objective of this research is to determine whether IDS facilitates novel word learning
in autistic children and to investigate if the effect of IDS is conditional upon input factors (recorded IDS vs live
IDS presented in social interaction) and child factors (extreme responses to auditory input, social motivation). In
Aim 1, we will use a video-based word learning paradigm to determine the effect of recorded IDS on novel word
learning in autistic children compared to language-matched TD peers. In Aim 2, we will focus on the effect of
live IDS on novel word learning: an experimenter will teach children two novel words, presented in live IDS or
live ADS, during social interaction. In Aim 3, we will examine whether child factors (extreme responses to
auditory input, social motivation) explain variability in word learning accuracy from recorded IDS and live IDS in
the autistic group. Children’s extreme responses to auditory input (including hyper- and hypo-responsiveness)
and social motivation will be measured using caregiver questionnaires and will be used to predict word learning
accuracy from recorded IDS (Aim 1) and live IDS (Aim 2) in the autistic group. Our central hypothesis is that
both input and child factors will impact the effect of IDS on word learning in autistic children. On a group level,
autistic children may find both recorded and live IDS overstimulating and thus not benefit as much from IDS as
compared to TD children. On an individual level, we predict that extreme auditory responsiveness will be
negatively associated with word learning from recorded and live IDS whereas social motivation will be positively
associated with word learning from live IDS. Findings from this work will (a) provide theoretical implications into
how children’s sensory and social profiles interact with the relationship between IDS and word learning and (b)
illuminate whether IDS may be leveraged in clinical settings to support language development in autistic children.
Data derived from this project will serve as pilot data for future R01 proposals that investigate the relationships
among early IDS exposure, attention to IDS, and vocabulary outcomes in autistic children and whether IDS or
attention to IDS in autistic children is malleable to improve language outcomes in this population."
10881749,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly aggressive and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. TNBC
is a major cause of death among breast cancer patients; and is the only subtype of breast cancer that is still
lacking effective prevention and therapeutic options. Development of novel preventive or therapeutic approach
for TNBC is an important task. The priority area of this research project is on women Veteran’s health, in
particular, on women Veterans with TNBC. To assist in this unmet medical need, we propose to
pharmacologically target Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 pathways simultaneously;
because IL-6 and CDK4/6 pathways’ co-activation is enriched in TNBC compared to other breast cancer
subtypes. The co-activation is also associated with a shortened time to develop metastasis. Multiple literatures
have reported that IL-6 signaling could confer resistance to anti-cancer drugs; and a report suggests that one of
the mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer cells is the activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway.
In addition, our preliminary results show that CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib further induces IL-6 levels in TNBC
cells, which could potentially make abemaciclib-treated TNBC cells more resistance to abemaciclib. Therefore,
co-activation of IL-6 in TNBC with CDK4/6, could potentially compromise the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and
provide strong rationale to co-target IL-6 and CDK4/6 pathways for effective TNBC preventive therapy. Currently,
no small molecule IL-6 drugs are available in clinical trials. To target IL-6 signaling in TNBC for preventive
therapy, we repurposed a FDA-approved orally bioavailable drug bazedoxifene as a novel inhibitor of the IL-
6/GP130 signaling. Bazedoxifene is marketed as DUAVEE (bazedoxifene with conjugated estrogens) for
preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. To target CDK4/6 in TNBC, we propose to test abemaciclib (Trade
Name: Verzenio), which is one of the most potent CDK4/6 small molecule inhibitors. Abemaciclib has been
approved by FDA for the treatments of hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Our preliminary data indicate that
bazedoxifene and abemaciclib combination synergistically inhibited TNBC cell viability in vitro and significantly
suppressed tumor growth in vivo. In addition, preliminary results observed that bazedoxifene and abemaciclib
combination prevented liver metastasis in orthotopic tumor model after the primary tumors were removed.
Our central hypothesis is that dual inhibition of the IL-6 and CDK4/6 pathways by bazedoxifene and abemaciclib
combination is an effective approach to prevent TNBC from further progression by suppressing tumor growth
and preventing tumor metastasis and tumor recurrence. We will test the central hypothesis by three specific
aims: (1) Evaluate the activity of bazedoxifene and abemaciclib combination in preventing TNBC tumor growth
and tumor recurrence using clinically relevant TNBC orthotopic mouse model in vivo. (2) Evaluate the efficacy
of bazedoxifene and abemaciclib combination in preventing TNBC tumor metastasis using two complementary
mouse models of TNBC experimental metastasis. (3) Elucidate the mechanisms of action of the bazedoxifene
and abemaciclib combination in TNBC. Successful completion of proposed studies has a potential to delay the
TNBC from further progression and metastasis for years using bazedoxifene-abemaciclib combination as a novel
approach for preventive therapy and presents a unique opportunity to improve patient care and survival for
women Veterans and women actively serving in the military with TNBC."

Histotripsy is an ultrasound surgical technique for non-invasive ablation of tissue that uses very intense bursts
of focused acoustic energy to mechanically fracture tissue through cavitation. A pilot clinical trial for liver ablation
has shown safety, efficacy, and good tolerance by patients while larger multi-site trials are currently underway.
This proposal seeks to solve two key limitations with current technology that will hinder widespread clinical use
of histotripsy ablation for a diverse range of patients. The first is targeting. Cavitation bubbles producing the
histotripsy therapeutic effect are directly visible with high sensitivity and contrast on ultrasound imaging.
However, prior to the initiation of therapy, the precise target location has an uncertainty on the order of several
millimeters due to refraction of the acoustic field from variations in sound speed. Aim 1 achieves this goal by
developing an ultrasound imaging sequence to directly visualize the histotripsy focus without producing
cavitation. The second limitation is aberration. In addition to focal shifts from refraction, tissue sound speed
heterogeneity reduces the peak amplitude of a histotripsy sound field. Measurements and acoustic simulations
show significant amplitude reductions that would be recovered using aberration correction (AC) techniques.
Simulations further suggest that even the highest performance transducer technology will have a limited
treatment envelope when targeting a diverse range of patients. For aim 2, we will optimize an AC technique for
histotripsy to recover this lost focal pressure and determine the best practices for use when ablating tissue
volumes . For aim 3, we will validate both techniques in human cadavers and use the results to calibrate further
acoustic simulations. Calibrated simulations will allow comprehensive studies in a diverse range of subjects and
facilitate designing the next generation of optimized transducer arrays for histotripsy ablation."

A key goal of genomics is to understand how each genomic variant contributes to an individual’s traits,
including their disease risks and likely responses to drugs or other environmental perturbations. However,
genome sequencing and clinical genetic testing have far outpaced our ability to understand variant impacts.
We have developed, scaled and democratized an array of technologies to map the effects of genetic variants
on molecular and cellular phenotypes, and these have been used by us and others to measure the effect of
~11 million variants thus far. However, meeting the promise of personalized genomic medicine will require
accounting for the fact that each individual has a unique life history beginning with development and laden with
exposures to diverse environments, and each individual variant exists in the context of millions of other
variants.
In the second phase of our Center for Excellence in Genome Science (CEGS) – the Center for Multiplex
Analysis of Phenotype (CMAP) – we propose to develop technologies for mapping variant effects at scale
across a wide range of environmental conditions, genetic contexts, and in multicellular model systems; and to
develop tools that leverage multiplex functional data to improve the prediction of disease risk.
For our renewed CMAP, we propose three Specific Aims:
Aim 1, Systematically assessing variant effects in relevant environmental, cell, tissue, and developmental
contexts;
Aim 2, Systematically assessing variant impacts in relevant genetic contexts;
Aim 3, Exploiting context-aware variant effect maps to infer individualized disease risk.
We also propose an Outreach and Education plan that leverages our considerable past success to broadly
disseminate the new technologies we develop.
The foundation in context-aware variant effect mapping that we will provide offers the tantalizing prospect of
going beyond simply classifying variants as pathogenic or benign to better forecast individual disease risks.

10875058,"Project Summary / Abstract: Administrative Core
The Roybal Center Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership, organizational management and
governance, financial oversight, systems for monitoring progress and compliance, and infrastructure to
promote transdisciplinary interaction, collaboration, and synergy among center components. The
Administrative Core will manage the Roybal Center's overall mission and annual goals, support the Roybal
Center Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core, project science, and internal and external
communication. To that end, the Administrative Core's function can be summarized into three specific aims.
Aim 1. Maintain the Center's strategic vision. The Administrative Core will plan, coordinate, review and
manage the Center's activities. These activities will be summarized and communicated by the Administrative
Core through the Roybal Center's website. Furthermore, the Administrative Core will manage an External
Advisory Committee that oversees the functioning of the Center and assists the PIs in making the scientific and
administrative decisions related to the Center, including the allocation of funds for new research studies and
clinical trials. Aim 2. Oversee BID projects. The Administrative Core will generate annual progress reports for
the NIA and work with the Roybal Coordinating Center to facilitate meetings and dissemination of knowledge.
In addition, the Administrative Core will serve to help develop and identify new projects and submit new project
proposals to the NIA for approval. Aim 3. Facilitate collaborative networks. The Administrative Core will
encourage and facilitate the development of strategic collaborative networks among researchers, commercial
interests, community interests, program design interests, and governmental entities to support translation
intervention development activities. The Administrative Core, led by Dr. Gazzaley who is a well-established
researcher, will draw on his extensive experience administering large, complex, collaborative, transdisciplinary
grants. Dr. Gazzaley's role as the Executive Director of UCSF Neuroscape is well-aligned with this proposal,
as he is already managing the development, validation, and dissemination of computer-based behavioral
interventions that involve multisite collaboration across similar activities as proposed here. The UCSF teams at
Neuroscape, including the Administrative Core Co-Investigators, also have experience, as demonstrated by
pioneering published research studies, in assembling and managing large teams of developers, programmers,
data scientists, data managers, post-doctoral fellows, and research coordinators to complete projects as
proposed here."
10875059,"Project Summary / Abstract: Behavioral Intervention Core
The overall goal for this Roybal Center Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core is to leverage
technology to facilitate memory and cognitive function so that cognitive decline may be prevented or delayed in
older adults and particularly those at-risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). The
Roybal Center BID Core will conduct Stage 0 through V studies in accordance with the multidirectional,
translational NIH Stage Model, to produce potent and implementable principle-driven behavioral interventions.
At UCSF Neuroscape, we have recently demonstrated our unique ability to take an idea for a behavioral
intervention based on our previous work that elucidated brain networks enabling higher cognitive functions and
see it through all six NIH Stages for intervention development (including all three Clinical Trial Phases) en
route to FDA approval. Indeed, the first video-game based intervention we created at Neuroscape has become
the first FDA approved, prescribed video-game, which is now an important non-drug treatment option for
children with ADHD. In this vein, the BID Core will operate to achieve three aims. Aim 1. Assessment of
efficacy and effectiveness of behavioral interventions in a community setting. The proposed research
will begin with two clinical trials, each assessing a different tablet-based behavioral intervention. The two
interventions target different aspects of cognitive function that we have shown via Stage 0 research to be
deficient in advanced age and substantially impaired by dementia. Specifically, one intervention (Coherence) is
designed to challenge timing and short-term memory ability whereas the other intervention (Labyrinth) will
improve high-fidelity capability in long-term memory (LTM). Importantly, we have already demonstrated initial
efficacy and effectiveness through Stage I-IV research in healthy older adults (aged 60+ years). Here, we
propose to continue Stage III and Stage IV testing of these interventions by expanding to an older adult
population with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test the hypothesized mechanisms of action for these
interventions. Aim 2. Refine interventions, assess feasibility and initial efficacy in a research setting. We
have recently demonstrated virtual reality (VR) engages attention more deeply than tablet-based platforms.
Therefore, this aim will develop and assess VR-based interventions as a step towards advancing next-
generation behavioral interventions with higher efficacy. These studies constitute Stages IA (refinement), IB
(feasibility) and II (initial efficacy) of the NIH Stage Model for intervention development. Aim 3. Maintain,
expand and enhance Nexus: A modern behavioral intervention platform. We have recently created Nexus
– a HIPPA compliant web-based platform that facilitates clinical trial research through remote screening,
intervention randomization, participant tracking, and outcome assessments. Here, we propose to maintain,
expand, and enhance Nexus so that collaborators (e.g., other Roybal Centers) may benefit from this
technology."
10875068,"Abstract
The vision of the USC-Yale Roybal Center for Behavioral Interventions in Aging is to expand the reach of
effective behavioral interventions that address the over- and underuse of medical care through an
understanding of their mechanisms of behavior change. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) improve the
general effectiveness of behavioral interventions that address over- and underuse of health services in aging
populations by clarifying their mechanisms; (2) address crucial problems relating to translation and
development of physician and patient interventions that facilitate value-based health care decisions, and (3)
test up to 10 randomized trials that evaluate mechanisms of behavior change. Our Center will operate under
the NIH Stage Model for behavioral interventions creating a pipeline of studies that span from basic research
(Stage 0) through full-scale dissemination of interventions (Stage V). Work will be managed through an
Administrative Core and research is conducted through a Behavioral Interventions Development Core. The
Center has a diverse External Advisory Committee composed of experts in behavioral science, mechanisms of
behavior change and health system leaders. Health system leaders work at implementation sites who will
recommend the priorities for studying mechanisms of behavior change. Implementation site members are
expected to broker relationships with their own institution so that these institutions can be test-bed for trials
evaluated by the committee. We propose two randomized trials in the first year of the award. The first study
aims to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing in older adults who visit the emergency department. The
second study aims to encourage older adults to designate a healthcare proxy. Both studies are Stage III and
involve randomization. Pathways toward advancing the stages of these two projects are discussed as are
solicitations for new trials in out-years. Continuity with the prior Roybal award is reflected in the Center’s focus
on greatest potential for population health impact through improvements in medical decisions. Through its
health system partners, the Center also expands its ability to support a growing community of researchers
conducting behavioral interventions to encourage appropriate use of medical treatments for midlife and elderly
populations."
10875069,"Abstract
The Administrative Core plays a crucial role in promoting collaboration among researchers within the Center
and the National Institute on Aging. Its main objective is to advance scientific knowledge by conducting studies
on the mechanisms of behavior change related to interventions aimed at improving medical care delivery. As
part of its specific aims, the Administrative Core manages the External Advisory Committee, which determines
the priorities for the request for applications. Additionally, it organizes a review panel to assist in the selection
of clinical trials. This process involves grant scoring and providing recommendations to the Principal
Investigators. Furthermore, the Administrative Core collaborates with the Behavioral Intervention Development
Core to provide scientific, statistical computing, and project management resources to awardees. This support
enables them to carry out their work at different stages of the research process and explore behavior change
mechanisms applicable across various settings. During clinical trials, the Administrative Core works alongside
the Behavioral Intervention Development Core to monitor the trials, develop evaluation metrics, and code
mechanistic targets. This ensures that the highest-priority behavioral interventions are identified, selected, and
supported in research endeavors. Additionally, the Administrative Core coordinates travel arrangements,
disseminates trial results, and expands the network of implementation partners through the Center's External
Advisory Committee. The Center follows the NIH Stage Model for behavioral research, evaluating the
relevance of fundamental social and cognitive principles and applying them appropriately to each mechanism
within each stage of the research process. The Administrative Core collaborates with trialists to develop
training materials and establish project pathways within the NIH Stage Model on a yearly basis. Throughout the
award period, the Administrative Core's significant contribution lies in fostering close collaborations between
behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. This collaboration aims to address pressing population health
concerns that contribute to the overuse of low-value services and the underuse of more effective services in
the nation."
10896397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly the oral cavity cancer (OrCa) is a debilitating
disease with no increase in overall survival rate for the past decade and the patients undergo significant physical
and psychological toll due to function loss of key organs in the region and cosmetic appearance. Currently the
frontline treatment is surgery, where >5-12 mm of normal tissue region beyond tumor margins are resected to
achieve clear margins and reduce loco-regional recurrence. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are
administered based on the tumor stage, however these therapies had severe toxicity and provided no added
benefit. Overall, there is a dire need for spatially localized therapeutic tools that can aid in tumor eradication
entirely or reduce the tumor burden sufficiently for optimal surgical resection with reduced normal tissue removal.
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is an effective, spatially localized cancer treatment with minimal damage to healthy
tissues. Despite its low-cost, success in reducing tumor burden, and excellent healing post-treatment of the oral
mucosa, PDT has yet to become a mainstream frontline therapy primarily because PDT efficacy in solid tumors
depends on significant accumulation of the photosensitizer (PS) at the tumor site, availability of oxygen near the
PS, and effective dosing of the PS-light irradiation combination. Our new nano-platform, Verosite, enhances all
three of these parameters, in addition to aiding image-guided surgery, poising it to significantly improve HNSCC
patient outcomes. Verosite (Verteporfin, Oxygen and Sensing Targeted platform) is a perfluorocarbon (PFC)
based nanoplatform that contains Indocyanine green (ICG) dye for photoacoustic (PAI) and fluorescence (FLI)
imaging contrast, PS verteporfin and oxygen for effective PDT, and will be targeted to Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR), a cell surface biomarker significantly overexpressed in OrCa. Once specifically accumulated
at the tumor, absorption of light by ICG will trigger a liquid to gas phase change of the PFC serves the purpose
to spatio-temporally deliver PS and O2 for effective PDT. Motivated by our promising preliminary data, we
hypothesize that best treatment outcomes (reduced tumor burden, low recurrence and enhanced quality of life
with minimal loss of normal tissue and function) will be obtained with Verosite enabled image-guided surgery
and oxygen enhanced PDT. We evaluate the hypothesis in three specific aims: Aim-1: Synthesize, optimize,
and characterize the Verosite platform, Aim-2: Establish Verosite NDs biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and
dose requirements for PDT in orthotopic OrCa murine models with varying EGFR expression and Aim-3:
Demonstrate that Verosite enabled oxygen enhanced PDT and fluorescence image-guided surgery will aid in
minimal normal tissue resection and enhance survival in various orthotopic OrCa models. Overall, our
customizable multi-functional Verosite platform will enhance PDT efficacy and can be adapted to alleviate
hypoxia in many oxygen-dependent therapies for a broad array of solid tumors."
10901862,"Adverse pregnancy outcomes can be the consequence of defects in several factors, such fetal or maternal
genetics, environmental exposures, uterine dysfunction, preeclampsia, nutrition, infection, inflammation, and
placental insufficiency. Development of a healthy placenta from trophectoderm precursors enables proper
nutrient, gas and waste exchange between the fetus and mother. Additionally, maternal and placenta-intrinsic
inflammation at the interface must be controlled to protect the fetus. This project addresses how genomic
instability (GIN) during oogenesis and embryogenesis can cause sexually dimorphic pregnancy outcomes,
and how the placenta may be especially susceptible to this condition. Research into this underappreciated
cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes is motivated by findings that female mouse embryos are dramatically
more prone to lethality when bearing certain GIN-causing mutations of DNA replication or repair genes. In one
such model that will be utilized in this project, the female-biased lethality was due to increased susceptibility
to inflammation, whereas male embryos were protected by the anti-inflammatory effects of testosterone.
Preliminary data implicate the placenta as the sensitive tissue underlying the embryonic death. Remarkably,
this sex-biased lethality occurred only if the dam also had a GIN genotype. The goals of this project are to
understand the tissue(s), cells, and mechanisms driving GIN-induced lethal inflammation. This will be
accomplished using the power of mouse genetics, genomics, and embryo manipulation. Aim 1 will test whether
the placenta, the embryo, or both, are responsible for female-biased lethality. We hypothesize that the highly
polyploid trophoblast giant cells may be especially sensitive to compromised DNA replication and GIN,
triggering innate inflammation. Aim 2 addresses why oocytes must come from high GIN mothers for the sex
bias to occur in fetuses bearing the mutant lethal genotype. Preliminary experiments implicate that such dams
produce oocytes with compromised mitochondria, and this hypothesis will be tested using mitochondrial
augmentation and -omics analyses. Aim 3 seeks to identify the molecular basis of lethal embryonic
inflammation, with a focus on triggers of innate immunity. A combination of genetic and molecular assays will
be used to test the hypothesis that nuclear GIN leads to mitochondrial RNA and DNA leakage, activating a
pathway(s) that stimulates transcription of inflammation-driving interferon genes.
Overall, if successful, the results will be relevant for interpreting and addressing individual cases of recurrent
pregnancy loss that may have a basis in intrinsic inflammation during gestation, and provide insights into
underappreciated mechanisms causing adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage and intrauterine
growth retardation."

 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important issue for food safety and public health. The
National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Retail Food Surveillance in
Hawaii started in 2020. This project will continue the NARMS retail food surveillance in
population representative urban and rural areas in the state of Hawaii. The project’s goal of
improving food safety and protecting public health will be achieved by undertaking the
following specific aims and activities. First, we will continue the NARMS retail food
surveillance in the state of Hawaii. Starting from 2021, our sampling will cover city and rural
areas of the state. Second, we will monitor trends of AMR in different pathogens in retail meat
and seafood specimens. We will collect retail meat (chicken, turkey, pork, beef) and seafood
(shrimp, salmon, tilapia) specimens monthly from randomly selected grocery stores in selected
city and rural areas. We will test meat samples for Salmonella, Campylobacter (poultry only), E.
coli and Enterococcus and seafood samples for Enterococcus, Aeromonas, Vibrio and other
lactose positive bacteria according to NARMS’ Retail Food Protocols. Bacterial isolates will be
sent to FDA monthly for antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) and whole genome sequencing
(WGS) (WGS of meat isolates will be done by UC Davis). Third, we will conduct
epidemiological studies on prevalence of AMR in retail food. We will collect store information
and metadata for each retail meat and seafood specimen and determine key links between the
prevalence of bacteria and their AMR (e.g. single or multiple drug resistance) and species,
origins, types, and forms of retail food, claims of antibiotics use, and seasons etc. Fourth, based
on results of this project, we will develop lay publications, outreach materials, abstracts and
posters, and peer-reviewed publications. We will disseminate findings to agriculture and
aquaculture communities, veterinarians, and the public via newsletters, extension workshops,
presentations in meetings and conferences, and peer-reviewed journals. Fifth, we will participate
in NARMS conference calls and working groups.
 By accomplishing these specific aims and activities, the project will characterize the trends of
AMR in retail foods in the state of Hawaii. The project will enhance NARMS Retail Food
Surveillance and increase public awareness of AMR in retail foods. The project will also
strengthen collaborations among federal and state agencies and academia on research, detection,
surveillance, and investigation of foodborne outbreaks associated with AMR in retail food.

10901871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Some types of cancers, as exemplified by estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, can recur as metastatic
disease many years or even decades following a dormancy period where the patient displays no clinical
symptoms. Late recurrence is thought to arise from disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that were not killed by initial
treatment and that lie dormant at metastatic sites such as the bone marrow until they reawaken. Strikingly, meta-
analysis of over 60,000 early-stage ER-positive breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy revealed
that the relative risk of recurrence progressively increases over a period of at least 20 years, indicating that
patients in complete remission with no evidence of disease could harbor dormant cancer and remain at risk of
metastatic relapse for the remainder of their life. Currently, there is no widely used method to monitor the dormant
state nor its reawakening. The arrival of cancer immunotherapy has revealed exciting possibilities using
engineered T cells as living medicines. T cells designed with tumor-targeting receptors and sophisticated genetic
circuits have led to striking treatment responses in patients with certain types of cancers that were previously
untreatable. This moment is an opportunity to not only build a future where T cells are engineered as therapies,
but also as living sensors that can detect cancer with sensitivities and specificities beyond what is currently
possible. The activation and growth of dormant tumor cells into micro-metastases require the hallmark
expression of proteases during key steps such as angiogenesis. To exploit protease dysregulation, this project
will develop engineered receptors that sense proteolysis to detect reawakening. These contain an extracellular
single chain antibody that is blocked by a peptide mimotope such that they can bind to their cognate antigens
only after the blocking peptide is removed by proteolysis, restricting T cell activation to the specific condition
where the cognate protease and tumor antigen are both present. Following activation, T cell sensors amplify the
release of synthetic biomarkers (blood, urine and imaging) for detection. Genetically encoded libraries (>10^4)
of protease-activatable receptors will allow in vivo screening of 1000s of candidate T cell sensors to positively
and negatively select for constructs that can report on awakening in different microenvironments such as the
bone marrow and lungs. The adoptive transfer of T cell sensors with memory phenotype could lead to life-long
T cell sensors that continuously monitor for future disease. These technological breakthroughs will have huge
implications in understanding how and when dormant cells reawaken and guide therapeutic interventions at the
earliest stages of reactivation."
10901872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are estimated to affect
3 million Americans, and the number of people living with IBD continues to rise. Currently available
medications are costly, ineffective for some patients, and associated with serious risks including opportunistic
infections, bone marrow suppression, hepatic inflammation, pancreatitis, and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent
need to improve our understanding of modulators of intestinal inflammation and repair in order to identify novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of IBD. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a relatively-recently characterized
family of immune cells that are enriched at barrier surfaces and modulate inflammation in response to cytokine
and microbial signals. In particular, group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) sense alarmins and cytokines such as IL-25, IL-33,
and TSLP, can be activated by the nervous system, and produce type 2 cytokines that promote anti-helminth
immunity and allergic inflammation. Furthermore, our lab has shown that ILC2s also exert tissue-protective
functions via secretion of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), resulting
in amelioration of tissue damage following intestinal injury. In new preliminary studies presented here, we show
that expression of the neuropeptide, neuromedin U (NMU), is increased during intestinal inflammation in mice,
and lack of endogenous NMU results in more severe disease in a model of chemical-induced intestinal
damage and inflammation. Conversely, therapeutic administration of NMU results in upregulation of ILC2-
derived AREG and ameliorates chemical-induced intestinal damage. Furthermore, similar to in inflamed murine
intestines, NMU expression is also elevated in IBD patient biopsies, and the receptor for NMU is detected on
human colonic ILCs. Based on our new preliminary data, we hypothesize that enteric neuron-derived NMU
activates the tissue-protective functions of ILC2s. We propose to generate a detailed understanding of how
NMU mediates tissue protection in both murine models of intestinal inflammation and human IBD. In Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that during intestinal injury and repair, expression, cellular sources, and spatial pattern
of NMU expression are altered. We will also test the role of endogenous enteric-derived NMU in maintaining
tissue homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will employ novel reporter mice to directly test the cellular and molecular
mechanism by which NMU mediates tissue protection. In Aim 3, we will define the NMU-NMUR1 axis in the
healthy human intestine and determine how alterations in NMU-NMUR1 signaling correlate with clinical and
endoscopic measures of IBD disease activity. In addition to uncovering fundamental and novel neuropeptide
biology and their unique roles in IBD, these studies will provide preclinical justification for development of novel
therapeutics to target this pathway."

The International Vasculitis Workshop is the premier academic meeting in the field of vasculitis, attracting the
world’s leading clinical, translational, and basic science investigators studying this group of rare diseases. The
overall objective of the 21st International Vasculitis Workshop is to bring together biomedical scientists and
clinicians, including new investigators, junior faculty, and trainees, who are interested in clinical, translational,
and basic science discoveries and the relationship of these results with pathophysiology, genetics/genomics,
and biomarkers of vasculitis and development of novel therapies for this fascinating group of organ- and life-
threatening diseases. Since the first Workshop in 1988, this biannual meeting has attracted an increasing
number of scientists from multiple disciplines and clinicians from many specialties. The Workshop is a unique
venue for addressing the clinical and scientific complexities and broad scope of organ involvement that are the
hallmarks of the vasculitides, ranging from small to large vessel diseases. Researchers who may otherwise
have little opportunity to cross paths, given their varied specialties and geographic locations, are provided with
an environment to interact and share ideas.
The combination of an aging scientific workforce, increased competition for funding for biomedical research,
financial pressures on academic institutions, and shifts in interests among biomedical trainees has led to a
steady decline in the number of young MD, PhD, and dual-degree investigators dedicated to careers in
hypothesis-based scientific research. These pressures are especially severe for people attempting to build
careers studying aspects of rare diseases. It is critical that young investigators have opportunities to present
their work at international conferences where they can receive meaningful recognition and feedback, gain
awareness of the broader advances in their areas of inquiry, and develop relationships with both junior and
senior colleagues that lead to meaningful scientific partnerships.
In this R13 grant application, we outline plans to use requested funds to support the active participation of
trainees and junior faculty in the 2024 International Vasculitis Workshop to directly advance their career
development in the field of vasculitis research with the goals of expanding their interest in the field and
providing opportunities for collaboration. The Workshop will also feature an enrichment program to assist
trainees and junior faculty in getting the most out the Workshop through i) orientation to the program; ii) guided
poster tours by experienced investigators highlighting both outstanding science and the interrelatedness of the
work; and iii) social networking events to encourage ongoing collaborations and a sense of community in the
field of vasculitis. The support of early-career investigators for this activity is an excellent investment in the
future of biomedical research in this set of complex diseases."
10899387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is an essential node governing the flux of glucose through glycolysis. It catalyzes
the rate limiting step of glycolysis, converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Dysfunction of
PFK is associated with many diseases including cancer, glycogen storage diseases, heart disease, and many
others. As befitting of its role as the gatekeeper of glycolysis, the activity of PFK is tightly regulated. In humans,
there are three PFK isoforms: liver (PFKL), platelet (PFKP), and muscle (PFKM), each with unique regulatory
properties. Our understanding of these regulatory properties is not complete, mainly because isoform-specific
structural information is lacking. Understanding PFK regulation is useful in the design of therapeutics and tools
for research. The proposed research will use cryo-EM, mutagenesis, in vitro kinetic assays, biophysical assays,
and cell-based assays to better define three aspects of isoform-specific PFK regulation. Firstly, PFKM is unique
due to its non-canonical response to pH and ATP. The biophysical basis for the regulation by ATP and pH in
PFKM will be assessed using cryo-EM, mutagenesis, and in vitro kinetics assays. Secondly, as structural infor-
mation on eukaryotic PFK emerges, differences in the active and inactive conformations have been identified.
Specifically, in PFK, the flexible C-terminal tail has been shown to become ordered upon PFK inactivation and
loss of the C-terminal tail in PFKL results in altered response to regulation by PFK. The proposed research will
define the role of the flexible C-terminal tail in the regulation of each PFK isoform using mutagenesis and kinetic
assays. Finally, PFKL has been demonstrated to oligomerize into filaments. It is hypothesized that PFKM can
also oligomerize into filaments. The proposed research will identify PFKM filaments in cells, structurally charac-
terize the filament, and define the role of filaments in PFKM regulation. The goal of this research is to better
define mechanisms of PFK regulation. The applicant’s long-term goals involve using cryo-EM and cell-based
assays as an independent researcher. This fellowship will help to prepare the applicant for a productive career
as an independent researcher using cryo-EM and cell-based assays to study important biological questions."
10886484,"Background: Treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may help prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD,)
which is a leading cause of death. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of PTSD treatment vs. placebo
on CVD risk would be unable to assess the relation of duration of PTSD symptoms (“dose”) to CVD risk (e.g., CHD
morbidity and mortality) rather than pathophysiological markers, given the duration of study and sample size
needed. Here, we propose to collect data to complement the results of the ideal trial – that is, to use observational
data appropriately and efficiently – by making use of our longitudinal study tracking the time-varying symptoms of
PTSD, time-varying conventional CVD risk factors and, as outcome, incidence and mortality from CVD. The multi-
ethnic WTC-Heart cohort study will be accompanied by a sub-study assessing whether, as assumed, individuals with
lower PTSD dose have lower exposure to markers of stress, trauma, and CVD risk factors. Preliminary work: 1. A
cohort study of initially 6481 first responders with a long term follow up and high retention rate: In 2012-2013
WTC-Heart enrolled 6481 first-responders in the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) to assess the determinants of
incident cases of CVD reported by cohort members and validated in medical charts, and incident hospitalizations
from the NY State hospitalization registry (SPARCS). Retention was 91% as of 2016. 2. Longitudinal assessment of
PSTD symptoms and conventional CVD risk factors: The cohort members have had up to 15 visits at the WTCHP in
which mental health and CVD factors were assessed. 3. A diverse gender and race/ethnic composition: the cohort
comprises 17% of women and 54% Non-Hispanic Whites. Specific Aims: Aim 1. To perform a second in-person,
standardized assessment in 2022-23 of the WTC-Heart cohort with follow-up until 2026, taking advantage of the
statistical power resulting from 13-14 years of follow-up, high prevalence of PTSD, linkage with National Death
Index. Aim 2. To estimate the causal effect of PTSD dose and its potential changes on total (fatal and non-fatal) and
non-fatal CVD, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases, overall and among ethnic (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic) groups. Analyses will use repeated assessments of PTSD and CVD between 2012
and 2026, and appropriate adjustment for time-updating CVD risk factors, and for COVID-19 exposure, using G-
methods. Aim 3. To assess the biological, behavioral and trauma history plausibility of the epidemiological
associations between PTSD dose and CVD risk by measuring biological indicators of chronic stress, history of trauma,
and CVD risk factor among a subsample of 240 participants randomly recruited within tertiles of PTSD dose.
Innovation and Significance: The proposed study has a potentially major clinical and public health significance if it
helps to determine whether: 1) risk of CVD morbidity and mortality is inversely related to PTSD dose; 2) first
responders in the WTCHP are entitled to be covered for CVD screening and care."
10886615,"ABSTRACT
 Despite decades of research into the immunopathology of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an
unpredictable, life-threatening, immune-mediated adverse reaction to heparin treatment, a fundamental
knowledge gap regarding the cause of HIT remains. The inability to predict HIT represents a considerable liability
associated with heparin, which is given to 12 million individuals or one third of all hospitalized patients every
year. Because the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HIT have yet to be identified, including
intrinsic immune cell roles and the difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic antibodies, there is an
essential need to apply alternative approaches to understand the biological basis for HIT and to identify clinically
implementable biomarkers. The PI’s central hypothesis is that immunogenomic variation impacts HIT
pathogenesis and can be used to differentiate non-pathogenic and pathogenic PF4/heparin antibodies, which
are produced by immune cell populations intrinsic to HIT. Based on strong preliminary data that constitute the
largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for HIT, the working hypothesis is that the presence of the
HLA-DRB3*01:01 allele combined with proliferating Vβ 5.1 family T-Cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes in Th2 cells
predisposes patients to pathogenic PF4/heparin antibody production, and these antibodies result in high HIT risk
in patients with the ABO O blood group. We will pursue three Specific Aims (SAs) to test the central hypothesis:
(SA1) Determine the role of ABO variation in HIT; (SA2) Determine the influence of genomic variation on
PF4/heparin antibody production; and (SA3) Identify intrinsic immune cell involvement in HIT. In SA #1, deep
ABO sequencing data will be utilized in our large cohort of functional assay-confirmed HIT patients to elucidate
the role of ABO variability in HIT. In SA #2, we will perform several GWAS to determine genetic influences of
PF4/heparin antibody production, including diverse populations, and differentiate genetic influences on
pathogenic versus non-pathogenic antibodies. In SA#3, we will sample paired cell populations during the acute
phase of HIT and after HIT resolution and conduct focused single cell (sc) studies to determine proliferation of
TCR clonotypes and activated cell populations using sc-RNA-TCR-CITE-seq. Our studies overcome major
limitations of previous genomic studies of HIT by incorporating large, diverse cohorts, a PF4/heparin antibody-
positive case group, and functional assay confirmation of HIT cases. This work is technically and conceptually
innovative as it leverages a sc-RNA-TCR-CITE-seq approach, utilizes large, unique HIT cohorts, and advances
an original model of HIT immunopathogenesis. We expect to provide mechanistic insights into HIT pathology
and advance a framework for clinical translation of HIT biomarkers with direct application to other adverse drug

The enormous impact of COVID-19 service disruptions on individuals with intellectual and developmental
disabilities (IDDs) has highlighted the critically urgent need to increase access to mental and behavioral health
services. Within IDD populations, genetic syndromes associated with IDDs (“syndromic IDDs”) represent a
particularly vulnerable subgroup. Many patients with syndromic IDDs present with medically complex
phenotypes and remain minimally verbal even into adulthood, creating challenges accessing and benefiting
from community-based interventions. Several reports point to extreme behavior and communication challenges
as the most pressing behavioral health concerns for this population. Our near-term goals seek to identify
effective approaches to target the more severe cognitive and behavioral phenotypes found in syndromic IDDs.
Here, we propose adaptations to function-based treatment (FBT) – an already well-established, person-
centered applied behavior analysis (ABA) model focused on replacing challenging behaviors with prosocial
communication and behavior responses. Using the Planned Adaptation approach, proactive adaptations to
improve the fit of FBT with the syndromic IDD population include syndrome-specific characterizations to inform
phenotype-environment interactions, systematic screening for automatically reinforced behaviors which are
often excluded from published FBT approaches, and adjustments to support minimally verbal individuals. This
proposal draws upon the expertise of the investigative group in syndromic IDDs, conventional and telehealth
behavioral interventions, and implementation sciences to evaluate the adapted, parent-implemented, telehealth
FBT model for syndromic IDDs (FBTsIDD). The goal of this fully remote hybrid type 1 effectiveness-
implementation study is to test FBTsIDD as delivered by non-specialist providers housed in medical hubs serving
individuals with syndromic IDDs. Aim 1 involves a 24-week randomized control trial (RCT) that will randomize
80 children (ages 2 to 12 years) with syndromic IDDs and moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and
their caregivers and randomize them into FBTsIDD or positive-parenting treatment (Treatment as Usual, TAU).
Our overarching hypothesis is that FBTsIDD will be associated with significant reductions in challenging
behaviors compared to TAU on independent evaluator ratings using a consumer-driven, Parent Target
Problems (PTP) inventory and standardized measures of behavior and functional communication. Aim 2 seeks
to systematically measure and understand both planned and unplanned adaptions to FBTsIDD using the
Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded (FRAME). Together, these aims provide an
innovative model to develop effective, acceptable, and scalable interventions for behavioral and
communication challenges across the diverse, vulnerable population of individuals with syndromic IDDs."

We have identified endomucin (EMCN), a component of the endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx, to be a novel
regulator of VEGFR2 signaling. siRNA-mediated knockdown of EMCN in human retinal capillary EC blocks
VEGF-induced angiogenic functions (proliferation, migration, and tube formation) in vitro and
neovascularization in vivo. Our data indicate that EMCN is necessary for VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2
internalization. We hypothesize that EMCN regulates VEGF-induced VEGFR2 endocytosis, and thus VEGF
signaling in EC. We propose: (i) To use a genetic approach to examine the role of EMCN in developmental
angiogenesis and pathologic neovascularization as well as in adult vascular stability. We have generated mice
with floxed EMCN that will be bred with Rosa-Cre to assess the effect of total EMCN knockout, and with
tamoxifen-inducible VE-cadherin to examine EC-specific knockout. (ii) To elucidate the molecular mechanism
through which EMCN regulates VEGFR2 internalization and signaling, cell biological and biochemical methods
will be employed to determine how EMCN functions in VEGF-VEGFR2 endocytosis, to elucidate the structural
characteristics of EMCN necessary for its role in VEGFR2 endocytosis, and to identify EMCN-VEGFR2 binding
proteins that may be involved in VEGFR2 internalization. (iii) To develop a monoclonal antibody that interferes
with the association between EMCN and VEGFR2, the glycosylated extracellular domain of EMCN will be used
as an antigen. Our preliminary data using truncation mutants of EMCN indicate that the extracellular domain of
EMCN is necessary for its effect on VEGFR2 signaling. Antisera will be screened on the basis of its effects on
VEGF-induced EC migration and VEGFR2 internalization. Antisera, that we have shown to interfere with the
effect of EMCN on VEGF-induced migration and VEGFR2 internalization, will be tested for its the ability to
block pathologic VEGF-induced permeability and angiogenesis in vivo – alone, compared to aflibercept (VEGF
trap), or as a combination therapy with aflibercept. VEGF neutralization is the primary mode of treatment for a
number of ocular pathologies that involve neovascularization and vessel permeability. While remarkably
successful, there is a significant proportion of patients who appear unresponsive to anti-VEGF therapy. In
addition, a number of non-vascular cells in the retina express VEGFR2, and are thus vulnerable to chronic
neutralization of local VEGF, with implications for neurotrophic and survival functions. Results of these studies
will provide new information about the role of EMCN in vascular development, vascular integrity, and
pathologic vessel growth; will reveal novel insights into the regulation of VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2 signaling;
and, will test EMCN as a unique endothelial cell-specific target for blocking abnormal VEGF-induced
angiogenesis and vascular permeability.

Women account for nearly 20% of new HIV cases in the United States but experience significant barriers to
accessing HIV prevention, addiction, and sexual health services. Women who inject drugs (WWID) are
particularly vulnerable to HIV due to a combination of social, biologic, and structural risk factors, and women
comprise many of the new HIV diagnoses in recent outbreaks among people who inject drugs (PWID). Similarly,
WWID are disproportionately impacted by major medical issues requiring hospitalization and leading to
premature death, especially when injection drug use is compounded by transactional sex and unstable housing.
HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medications for opiate use disorder (MOUD), and treatment of sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) are proven strategies for HIV prevention and addiction treatment among WWID;
however, uptake remains low. Our preliminary data suggests that a co-located neighborhood clinic offeringwalk-
in appointments dramatically improves uptake of HIV prevention and addiction treatment but does not result in
sustained use of these evidenced-based interventions. Globally, delivery of HIV prevention and sexual
healthcare at venues for exchange sex is an effectivetool for engaging marginalized populations, such as female
sex workers; however, this strategy has not yet been implemented in the U.S. In direct contrast to traditional
models of healthcare, an evening, drop-in clinic, co-located at a venue for exchange sex and drug use provides
increased opportunity to access care in a client-centered environment. Leveraging a global to local approach,
we propose a pilot venue-based pop-up primary and preventative care clinic for WWID. Formative, qualitative
research and a bi-directional community engagement plan will inform the adoption of global models for HIV
prevention and addiction services (e.g. PrEP, MOUD, STI screening, etc.), with the goal of supporting sustained
us of evidence-based interventions. We hypothesize that venue-based care will be acceptable to WWID and
improve uptake of preventive care. We also hypothesize that implementation of participant designed support
strategies will improve adherence to PrEP, MOUD, and STI treatment. Aim 1 will assess barriers and facilitators
to uptake and sustained use of PrEP and MOUD and inform conversations with our community advisory board
to adapt a global to local venue-based care model, tested in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will pilot a venue-based model
of care for 50 WWID. Using novel rigorous laboratory science methods, we will measure the impact of venue-
based care on sustained use of PrEP and MOUD (Aim 2a), and we will similarly measure the acceptability and
feasibility associated with venue-based care for WWID. If successful, our study will provide data on a feasible
model of care for reducing HIV acquisition among WWID, which can be assessed for cost-effectiveness and
further tested at scale."

Objectives: The Advanced Data Analytics Program To (ADAPT) will enhance behavioral and social sciences
research, by training a diverse next generation of data scientists who will learn interdisciplinary skills needed for
successful careers in behavioral and social sciences health-related data science.
Rationale: San Diego is a hub for genomics, mobile technology, behavioral health research and data science in
Southern California, yet no data science curriculum for behavioral scientists currently exists. The ADAPT
program will fill this gap and intersect the areas of health sciences, informatics, computer science, and statistics
in Southern California.
Design: ADAPT will educate doctoral students in the behavioral and social sciences to build and further expand
an ecosystem for big data analytics that promotes finding, accessing, interoperating, and reusing digital objects
and responsibly computing with human subjects’ data in cloud environments. The ADAPT program will be based
at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with faculty collaborators from San Diego State University. It
will be based on two joint doctoral programs (JDPs) at these universities (Clinical Psychology and Public
Health/Behavioral Health). Dual mentoring by faculty with expertise in behavioral and social sciences and
computer science, biomedical informatics, or statistics will ensure a truly interdisciplinary focus that will cover
team science and responsible conduct of research.
Key Activities: Trainees will gain expertise through coursework, research experience during rotations and
external internships, mentoring and other activities. Existing data science courses were selected for the
curriculum, which will also include a new course in cloud-based human subjects’ data computing. Through
individualized development plans, ADAPT trainees will work with their faculty mentors to tailor the curriculum
and career paths according to students’ interests and skills. Data science coursework will utilize elective course
slots in the JDP curricula, will typically be completed in years 1 and 2 of the JDPs. They will provide the
foundational knowledge needed for academic and industry rotations and for the start of the trainees’ research
phase.
Projected Number of Trainees: 6 first or second year JDP students
Planned Duration of Appointments: 3 years, renewed annually based on good academic standing
Intended Trainee Outcomes: Metrics for success will include number and quality of publications, and rate of
academic milestone completion. Trainees who complete the ADAPT program will possess the scientific
knowledge needed to be a behavioral health data scientist, understand ethical and regulatory aspects of
computing with protected health information, and will become critical members of scientific teams working in
academia, government, for-profit and non-profit research institutions."

This NIH K08 proposal describes a five-year career development plan for Dr. Aivi T. Nguyen to obtain the
necessary research and professional skills and serve as transition to become a successful, independently
funded physician-scientist. Dr. Nguyen completed her clinical training in Anatomic Pathology and
Neuropathology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, after which she pursued post-doctoral
training under the mentorship of Dr. Edward B. Lee in the Translational Neuropathology Research Laboratory,
University of Pennsylvania. Currently, Dr. Nguyen is an assistant professor at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN and
contributing neuropathologist to the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Mayo Clinic Study of
Aging (MCSA). Dr. Nguyen’s long-term research focus is examining the role of microglia in cognitive resilience,
normal aging, and aging-related CNS diseases through integration of neuropathology and translational
research approaches to better understand neuroinflammation in human disease. This K08 award will provide
protected time to acquire expertise in integrating antemortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers and
neuropsychiatric data with postmortem neuropathology and to obtain expertise in two-photon in vivo imaging of
microglia in AD mouse models. Research will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Prashanthi Vemuri, an
expert in cognitive resilience and neuroimaging, and Dr. LongJun Wu, an expert in microglial dynamics and
neuroimmune interactions using two photon in vivo imaging. This award will also provide protected time for Dr.
Nguyen to gain expertise through formal coursework, scientific seminars, and scientific meetings.
AD, neuropathologically defined by β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, progresses in a spatio-
temporally distinct fashion that can be studied in vivo by recent advances in neuroimaging and fluid
biomarkers. Several ante- and postmortem studies have shown a discrepancy between AD pathology extent
and cognition, forming the basis of cognitive resilience. A potentially protective microglial subpopulation termed
amyloid-responsive microglia (ARM) was previously described in a single-nuclei RNA sequencing study of
human AD brain. Whether microglial heterogeneity, specifically ARM, contribute to resilience is unclear. This
proposal leverages antemortem AD biomarkers, cognitive data, and postmortem tissue from MCSA
participants to address these specific aims: (1) Determine postmortem ARM tissue expression association with
antemortem fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers, and whether ARM may be predicted by biomarkers; (2)
Evaluate differential ARM tissue expression in cognitively resilient individuals versus not, and test antemortem
predictors; and (3) Examine ARM phagocytosis and effects on downstream neuronal dystrophy in the setting of
AD genetic risk. These studies will drive the development of an independent research program to study
microglial heterogeneity and its role in resilience and AD and provide better understanding of cognitive aging."

Twenty percent of people in the United States will develop heart failure during their lives. Despite beneficial
effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers,
and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on mortality, the five-year life expectancy of a patient with heart failure
is fifty percent. In 2015, the FDA approved LCZ696 (Entresto™), a molecular complex of the ARB valsartan and
sacubitril, a neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase-24.11) inhibitor prodrug, after LCZ696 reduced mortality compared
to enalapril in a randomized clinical trial in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and increased
circulating brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT) proBNP. LCZ696 also reduces rehospitalization in
acutely decompensated heart failure. Nevertheless, LCZ696 has been underutilized in clinical practice, and
concerns regarding hypotension have impeded use. The mechanism(s) through which the combined ARB and
neprilysin inhibitor reduces blood pressure are not fully known. Neprilysin degrades many vasoactive peptides
including the natriuretic peptides, angiotensins (Ang) I and II, endothelins, bradykinin, and substance P. In heart
failure patients, LCZ696 increases BNP, a neprilysin substrate, while decreasing the non-neprilysin substrate
NT-proBNP, suggesting that LCZ696 potentiates effects of the natriuretic peptide. On the other hand, natriuretic
peptides are poor substrates for neprilysin compared to bradykinin and substance P, which can have beneficial
effects on blood pressure, diuresis, natriuresis, fibrinolysis and remodeling but also contribute to adverse effects
like hypotension and angioedema. Our research group has extensive experience studying the contribution of
peptides to drugs that inhibit vasopeptidases such as ACE, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), and neprilysin. In this
proposal, we test the overarching hypothesis that bradykinin contributes to vasodilator, blood pressure and renal
effects of combined angiotensin receptor blockade/neprilysin inhibition. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
LCZ696 potentiates the effects of intra-arterial bradykinin, substance P, or BNP compared to valsartan alone.
We will test this hypothesis in the presence and absence of a DPP4 inhibitor, as it may enhance effects of
neprilysin inhibition. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that endogenous bradykinin contributes to hypotensive,
natriuretic and diuretic effects of LCZ696 during initiation and up-titration in heart failure patients using a
bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. In Aim 3, we will probe the contribution of endogenous substance P to effects
of LCZ696 using a substance P (NK1) receptor antagonist. In the combined Aims 2 and 3, we will assess
individual patient factors such as race, gender, BNP (measured both by clinical immunoassay and by specific
mass spectrometric assay), and NEP activity that predict blood pressure response to LCZ696. These studies
will provide novel information about the mechanism(s) of action of combined angiotensin receptor blockade and
neprilysin inhibition, and lead to new strategies to minimize adverse effects while maximizing beneficial effects
of this promising new class of drugs for heart failure."

Much of the research has focused on middle childhood and adolescence, however, there is mounting evidence

biological pathways through which early life stress affects risk for psychopathology in early childhood, and by
which caregiving can alter biological and psychological stress responses . We propose to recruit 150 children,
aged 4-6 years, within 3 months of parental divorce (stress group) and compare them to 75 control children
from families with no history of parental divorce. Stress and control children will be followed at 6 and 18 months
later. We choose divorce as a stressor because it is common in early childhood; represents the exacerbation of
multiple stressful family processes; disrupts the caregiving environment; and is associated with internalizing
and externalizing problems and long-lasting psychopathology in children. This population will allow us to study
the unfolding of stress responses, which is almost impossible to capture for other more severe stressors. We
focus on the 4-6 years period because it is a period of heightened neural plasticity and a transitional period
from family to peer and teacher relationships, which makes children especially sensitive to a stressor that could
disrupt their caregiving environment. We assess biological stress responses using: 1) hair cortisol
concentrations (HCC), a retrospective measure of chronic HPA axis activity; 2) salivary cortisol, a measure of
current HPA axis activity; and 3) MRI structural and functional connectivity in areas implicated in stress
responses. We will assess pre-divorce factors (e.g., parental history of psychopathology, parental conflict),
post-divorce parental adjustment using self-report and biological measures (HCC); parent-child behavioral and
brain synchrony, a biological measure of the parent-child relationship; other post-divorce factors (e.g., ongoing
conflict); and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children. We hypothesize that the stress group will
show higher HCC, salivary cortisol, and structural and functional connectivity early on following divorce
compared to control children; and that pre-divorce factors will moderate these relationships. The stress group
will show decreased HCC, salivary cortisol, and structural and functional connectivity over time; and parental
reduced cortisol and increased psychiatric symptoms and decreased parent-child behavioral and brain
synchrony and other post-divorce factors will mediate these relationships. Finally, early biological responses
and changes in these responses over time will predict internalizing and externalizing symptoms. This study will
examine the neurobiology of stress responses in early childhood and will improve our understanding of the

training. Mentoring faculty are chosen based on research accomplishment, a history of successful research
collaborations, and a history of successful research mentoring. Since the last renewal, we have also added
secondary mentors, to expand expertise, involve junior faculty, and provide additional collaborative
opportunities. The program includes both core and individualized curricular components. Core curricular
components includes an ongoing work-in-progress seminar with both faculty and trainee involvement, a writing
group, yearly retreats, career development seminars, and training related to the responsible conduct of
research and methods to enhance reproducibility and rigor. The individualized curricular components include
both class work and direct project experience, including dissemination, mentored by a mentorship team.
Ongoing empirically-based review of the program demonstrates both a high level of success of this program’s

Despite robust evidence that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), the mechanism of this increased risk remains obscure. In particular, obesity, hypertension, and
diabetes (all components of MetS) have been reported in this population as primary risk factors for cardiac events
with the leading cause of mortality. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal cardiovascular
function have been investigated in in-vitro and rodent models under MetS conditions, their exact role in the
formation of cardiac collateral vessels is largely unknown. There is a lack of evidence and extension in
experiments with large animals and patients of these principles. This awareness is an essential prerequisite for
their human application.
We will induce MetS with insulin resistance in male intact Yorkshire pigs with high fat feeding a model that
recreates many of the metabolic, molecular, and microcirculatory abnormalities present in MetS patients. Our
prior studies and preliminary data show that porcine models of diabetes closely resemble the disease in patients
and lead to diminish myocardial and vascular regeneration and we will use the model in this proposal. In order
to adjust the blood glucose level, we will treat pigs with sitagliptin and canagliflozin and compare the answer to
lean diet controls. In this proposal we will concentrate on the effects of SGLT1 inhibition on collateral
development and the metabolic, molecular, and microcirculatory abnormalities present in patients with overt
diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Our focus is on functional changes in collateral dependent myocardial
perfusion, vascular density, and microvascular function together with key molecular events involved in the altered
collateral formation process in vivo.
We will use mechanistic approach to understand molecular interactions in pathways and networks and functional
attributes to unravel the molecular base of impaired angiogenesis in diabetes. Our published and preliminary
data suggests for involvement and functional interactions in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), citric
acid cycle (CAC), insulin signaling, and protein O-GlcNAcylation.
The proposed integrated approach will result in the identification of crucial pathways, molecular targets, and
strategies in pro-angiogenic therapy and cell-based regeneration and tissue engineering, the clinical importance
of this proposal is evident. The use of a large animal model with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome is a
strong aspect of the project."
10886632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The prevalence and incidence of neurological complications in people with HIV (PWH) remains steady
for those aging on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Eliminating the tight association between chronic
inflammation and HIV reservoirs in the periphery and CNS remain major therapeutic challenges. Elevated
osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein-1 (OPN/SPP1) in PWH having moderate to severe neurological
complications was first reported in 2008. Since this time, the importance of high OPN/SPP1 RNA expression in
human brain and more widely in neurodegenerative microglia has emerged. However, much remains to
uncover about OPN/SPP1's fundamental basic molecular mechanism (s) of action in the brain in HIV infection.
In this regard, our investigations over the past several years using in vitro and in vivo experimental models have
begun to close the gap. A fundamental concept has emerged from our collective findings: OPN/SPP1 function
is required in the CNS for brain recovery and return to homeostasis after infection. For the first time, able
to knockdown OPN expression in vivo, we obtained a clearer view that its functional specificity is context-
dependent. OPN/SPP1 signaling supports viral replication in vivo within tissue compartments via an as yet
uncharacterized mechanism that varies with sex. In addition, OPN/SPP1 expression is strongly correlated with
the retention of immune cells in the peripheral organs. OPN/SPP1 supports increased trafficking of SIV
monocytes to the brain, but whether the same is true for human cells is not known. We discovered using micro-
PET neuroimaging, that when homeostasis is disrupted by HIV infection, OPN/SPP1 is a potent sensor and
regulator of neuroinflammation in the brain. An additional novel insight gained was the detection not only of
inflamed microglia, but of a unique subset of “activated” translocator protein (TSPO) and tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) reactive neurons in the striatum. We hypothesize that the conservation of OPN as a sensor/regulator
of CNS homeostasis in adult mammals suggests that it plays a key central mechanistic role in
neuroprotective pathways that modulate neuroinflammation. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms are
tissue context-dependent and utilize ligand-receptor dynamics initiated by microglia and propagated by
specific neurons in the striatum. Teasing out of the mechanistic details requires a combinatorial approach
using basic biochemical and molecular tools, in vitro primary cell culture and the latest in vivo chimeric mouse
models. Importantly, we have successfully demonstrated that the mouse-human chimera represented in the
NSG-hCD34 system recapitulates key aspects of neuroinflammation similar to that seen in people with neuroHIV.
Testing of the underlying hypotheses of the integrated aims of this proposal will determine which splice variants
of OPN/SPP1 are active in the CNS, identify new mechanistic insights into why disruption of OPN/SPP1
increases neuroinflammatory signaling in microglia and specific neuronal subtypes, how these responses are
regulated and whether cognition or affective behaviors are altered."
10886637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 There is a critical gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms during CD8 T cell priming that promote
tissue-resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cell development. In the absence of such knowledge, the realization of
developing vaccination strategies that elicit robust memory T cells at sites of pathogen invasion or tumor
development remain unlikely. The long-term goal is to determine the mechanisms that regulate the induction
and maintenance of TRM cells to improve vaccine efficacy. The overall objective in this application is to define
how priming influences the in situ development of intestinal CD8 TRM cells. The central hypothesis is that direct
retinoic acid signals during T cell priming in the gut draining lymph nodes license CD8 TRM cell development in
the intestine. This hypothesis is based on rigorous preliminary data that suggests that retinoic acid licenses
CD8 TRM precursor cell development independent of the well known CCR9-mediated gut migration pathway.
The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that knowledge of the factors that promote CD8 TRM cell
development will provide a strong scientific framework to develop more effective and targeted vaccination
strategies. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that
priming in mesenteric lymph nodes promotes intestinal CD103+ CD8 TRM cell differentiation; 2) To test the
hypothesis that retinoic acid licenses intestinal CD103+ CD8 TRM cell development; and 3) To test the
hypothesis that dietary vitamin A enhances CD103+ CD8 TRM cell development to improve vaccine efficacy.
MLN or spleen derived cells will be used to assess CD103+ CD8 TRM cell development in the gut and in distal
tissues after foodborne infection. Agonists and antagonists of retinoic acid receptors (RAR) in combination with
RAR and CCR9 knockout mouse models will be used to determine how retinoic acid licenses intestinal CD8
TRM cell development. Finally, vitamin A deficient or supplemented diets will be used to modulate retinoic acid
and assess vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes
foodborne infection with a mouse adapted human pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, to interrogate intestinal T
cell responses. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to define novel pathways through
which retinoic acid impacts intestinal CD8 TRM cell development independent of CCR9 and gut migration.
Ultimately, such knowledge can be applied to improve rationale vaccine design targeting gastrointestinal
pathogens or immunization in malnourished individuals with vitamin A deficiency."
10885344,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Selective neuronal vulnerability is a striking yet largely untapped aspect of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) -during
early prodromal stages, pathological tau protein accumulates almost exclusively in excitatory neurons from
layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII). ECII neurons are also the first to degenerate in AD. A large body of
evidence indicates that AD pathological lesions increase the excitability of neurons in the hippocampal
formation, while overall increased network activity accelerates lesion formation. Our recent work suggests that
tau pathology and the regulation of neuronal excitability are particularly tightly linked in ECII neurons, through
cell-autonomous mechanisms. It is therefore crucial to gain a comprehensive view on the mechanisms
modulating electrophysiological properties of ECII neurons, as a pre-requisite to understand the preferential
formation of pathological lesions in these cells. Here, we therefore propose to simultaneously characterize
single ECII neurons at the electrophysiological and transcriptomic levels using Patch-Seq, in order to identify
major intrinsic regulators of ECII excitability, and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance, as well as their
perturbation in a context akin to early AD. In Aim 1, we will correlate electrophysiological parameters with
individual gene expression and with expression of gene modules that we previously found associated with tau
pathology. By performing Patch-Seq both in wild-type mice and in a mouse model of amyloid accumulation, we
will determine whether amyloid disrupts the ability of certain genes to regulate ECII electrophysiological
properties. Independently, we also have preliminary evidence that an ECII-enriched miRNA downregulated in
AD -miR-129-2- may modulate ECII E/I balance. In Aim 2 we will thus determine the contribution of miR-129-2
to the regulation of electrical properties of ECII neurons. We will inhibit miR-129-2 in vivo and subsequently
profile EC to determine candidate target genes of the microRNA and perform whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings in ECII neurons ex vivo. Taking advantage of the broad range of expression levels of miR-129-2
across ECII neurons, we will then perform Patch-miRNA-qPCR in ECII neurons: we will quantify miR-129-2
levels in electrophysiologically-characterized neurons. This will allow us to determine whether miR-129-2 levels
correlate with certain electrophysiological features of ECII neurons. Taken together the work outlined in this
proposal will identify the major molecular mechanisms by which ECII neurons cell-autonomously adjust their
electrical properties, and how amyloid interferes with this process. This will lay the groundwork for future
studies to determine whether key genes identified here also modulate tau accumulation and vulnerability of
ECII neurons."

neoplasm (IPMNs) precursor lesions are distinguished by recurrent activating mutations in GNAS, that encodes
G-protein Gαs, and induces cyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling. GNAS is mutationally activated and amplified
pancreatic and many other human tumors, yet its oncogenic functions remain unclear. Therefore, understanding
the function of mutant GNAS will provide disease mechanisms and give opportunities to treat PDA even in their
early stages. To understand the function of oncogenic GNAS we established a doxycycline-tunable mouse model
and showed that mutant GNAS cooperates with oncogenic KRAS to initiate IPMNs that progress to invasive
PDA upon p53 loss. GNAS remains critical for the maintenance of established tumors, via a protein kinase A
(PKA)-dependent network and resulting inhibition of salt-inducible kinases (SIK1-3). We demonstrated that this
network prominently reprograms metabolic pathways which are potential alternative sources of TCA cycle
metabolites, respiratory substrates (NADH) and fatty acid intermediates that can support the growth of GNAS
mutant tumors. Importantly, GNAS-mutant cancer cells are specifically sensitive to the inhibition of these
pathways compared to GNAS-wt tumors. These results establish mutant GNAS as a novel tumor maintenance
driver, uncover the underlying PKA-dependent program, establish SIKs as major tumor suppressors, and
demonstrate unanticipated metabolic heterogeneity fueling subsets of pancreatic cancer. Based on our
published and unpublished supporting data, the overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the roles of
critical downstream targets of GNAS-PKA signaling that control the expression of proliferation and metabolic
genes. Our research will also illuminate how mutant GNAS regulated expression of a keto dehydrogenase
generate biosynthetic and bioenergetic intermediates to support tumor growth. Finally, our study will interrogate
the regulation of respiratory activity and its requirement in GNAS mutant pancreatic cancer. This study will
leverage advanced methods and unique tools, including global transcriptomic analysis and isotopomer-based
metabolic profiling in genetically defined mouse and human organoid systems, preclinical pancreatic cancer
animal models, relevant patient-derived xenograft systems and primary samples. Our research will provide
understanding of the unique biology of mutant GNAS and points out targetable vulnerabilities in genetic subsets
of pancreatic tumors."

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a highly aggressive subtype of prostate cancer that can arise de
novo, but more commonly develops after hormone therapies for advanced prostate adenocarcinoma (PADC). It
accounts for up to 25% of deaths related to prostate cancer. Current treatment options for NEPC are only
palliative, and most patients die within several months. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need to develop
effective targeted therapies for patients with NEPC.
 Among molecular events associated with NEPC, loss of retinoblastoma (RB) protein occurs nearly
universally and drives prostate cancer castration resistance, metastasis, lineage plasticity, and lethality, which
suggests that RB1 loss is a pivotal event in the development of NEPC and may be exploited to identify and target
therapeutic vulnerabilities in NEPC. In our recent research into the molecular and genetic events underlying
ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, we discovered that RB1
disruptions significantly sensitize prostate cancer cells to ferroptosis, at least in part, through a RB/E2F/ACSL4
axis, and that ferroptosis inducers preferentially kill RB1-null NEPC cells rather than RB1-intact PADC cells,
implying the therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inducers in the treatment of NEPC. Given that NEPC is
notoriously hard to treat and monotherapy often benefits only a small portion of patients, as is the cases with
other poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors such as small-cell carcinoma of the lung, we propose to
develop an effective combinatorial therapy for NEPC based on targeting ferroptosis. Our exciting unpublished
preliminary data has shown that the combination of the ferroptosis inducer with the BCL2 inhibitor strongly
induces synergistic cytotoxicity in NEPC cells both in vitro and in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models of
NEPC. Based on these compelling preliminary findings, we hypothesize that ferroptosis inducers and BCL2
inhibitors synergistically promote cell death pathways in NEPC cells, and that co-targeting ferroptosis and BCL2
represents a promising combinatorial approach to treating lethal NEPC. Through a multidisciplinary approach
combining unique prostate cancer model systems, in vivo preclinical studies, and well-established molecular and
cellular assays, we aim to determine whether co-targeting ferroptosis and BCL2 represents a promising
combinatorial approach to treating lethal NEPC. In Aim 1, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis
induction combined with BCL2 inhibition in patient-derived xenograft models of NEPC. In Aim 2, we will determine
the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis induction combined with BCL2 inhibition in genetically engineered mouse
models of NEPC. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activity of
ferroptosis induction combined with BCL2 inhibition in NEPC."

Attrition of underrepresented minority (URM) scientists between the PhD and faculty stages presents a major
stumbling block to diversify the biomedical workforce. While multiple factors contribute to this attrition, the
postdoc stands as a critical step that can define academic career outcomes. Even more than their PhD lab,
where a trainee does their postdoc determines their academic productivity and odds of securing a tenure-track
position. Unfortunately, preparation for the PhD to postdoc transition is informal, unstructured and variable, and
presents a unique set of planning, mentoring, and communication challenges. For URM students, these
challenges are compounded, making their attrition much more likely. We propose to adapt and apply the
validated professional development strategies of the Yale Ciencia Academy (YCA) to an unattended transition
that is impacting faculty diversity: the PhD to postdoc transition. Through training interventions that include
practice and modeling, vicarious learning experiences, and peer mentoring interactions, we will make evident
the planning, mentoring, and effective communication complexities required for this transition. Specifically,
students will (a) craft an individual development plan (IDP) that is specific to the PhD to postdoc transition; (b)
master the career planning, mentoring-up and communication skills they need to successfully execute their plan;
(c) produce communication materials for use during postdoctoral interviews and grant submissions; and (d)
cultivate a network of peer mentors, role models, and advisors that can support them through the transition and
beyond. By providing tangible outcomes and skills in career planning, mentoring-up, and communication, we
expect the program will enhance participants’ academic and science communication self-efficacy, scientific
identity and positive outcome expectations, and result in a postdoctoral placement that aligns with their career
goals. A minimum of 16 biomedical URM PhD students will be recruited per year throughout the US for a total
of 64 students over four cohorts. To extend the impact of our program, we will turn most of our trainings into free
video-based modules with accompanying implementation guides, estimated to impact thousands of additional
students. The skills and the know-how developed during this program will allow students to model supportive
mentoring environments and effective career development practices as postdocs and ultimately as faculty,
contributing to more inclusive academic research environments. In the long term, we expect YCA to increase
persistence and the number of URMs in academic research positions."
10887550,"A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and
animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely
 reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a
particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will
view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference
 dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial
products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of
neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This
work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs
 of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.
 This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats,
enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral
training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a
 behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior
across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to
record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from
 the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will
develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of
simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model
will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and
 aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we
 will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the
 neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3)."
10887551,"SUMMARY
Cellular responses to external stimuli require dynamic gene regulation to facilitate rapid activation and effective
resolution. Although transcriptional responses are a textbook mechanism for stimulus-induced responses, post-
transcriptional regulation of mRNA translation and decay are the other side of the coin and are essential for rapid
and adaptable stimulus-induced responses. For example, immune activation generates a prototypical temporal
expression pattern for cytokine mRNAs known as an impulse response, which is a rapid pulse-like increase and
decrease in expression. The destabilization of cytokine mRNAs is required for proper resolution of the impulse
response and prevention of excess cytokine production. It is increasingly recognized that RNA-binding proteins
(RBPs) play critical roles in achieving an appropriate stimulus-induced gene expression response by regulating
RNA processing, decay, and translation of target RNAs. The over-arching goal of our research program is to
understand how RBPs temporally coordinate stimulus-induced gene expression and cellular phenotypes.
The model system we will use to study how dynamic RBP-RNA regulatory interactions temporally coordinate
stimulus-induced gene expression is human adrenal steroidogenesis. This is a classic ligand-induced system in
which the small peptide Angiotensin II (AngII) binds to its receptor in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells to stimulate
the production of aldosterone, the master regulator of blood pressure. Thus, tight control of regulatory timing is
required since it must be rapidly produced de novo from cholesterol in response to AngII. We have recently
demonstrated that AngII treatment of immortalized and primary adrenocortical cells results in an impulse
response. Furthermore, we found specific RBPs and regulated RNA decay facilitates the rapid implementation
and resolution of the AngII impulse response. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that MSI2 and ZFP36L2
are counteracting forces that, respectively, potentiate and attenuate the kinetics of stimulus-induced mRNA
levels by modulating target mRNA decay and translation, to ensure the proper timing and amplitude of the
impulse response. We will utilize cutting edge methods to gain temporal and quantitative insights into how
stimulus-induced changes in RBP binding determine changes in target mRNA expression responses and
ultimately cellular phenotype. The use of innovative approaches we use will help shift the field from a static to a
dynamic view of RBP-mRNA interactions and achieve mechanistic insight on how regulatory RBP-mRNA
interactions control mRNA fate decisions to govern cellular responses."

We propose a new program of training in cancer research for surgery residents pursuing a career in
academic Surgical Oncology. The rationale is that there is a nationwide shortage of surgeon-scientists. A
T32 program would enable us to train high caliber surgical trainees so that they can contribute to new
cancer therapies and discoveries, improve the care of cancer patients, and mentor future trainees. T32
trainees will have already completed 3 years of postgraduate clinical training in surgery. The 2-year T32
training program will provide an intensive research experience in hypothesis formulation, experimental
design, research techniques, data analysis, and oral and written presentation. After completing the T32
program, the trainees return to the clinic for the 2 final clinical years of residency. Most pursue an
additional 2 years of fellowship specialization after finishing residency training. The ultimate objective of
the program is to train surgeon-scientists to perform oncologic research upon completion of their surgical
training and become leaders in academic surgical oncology. We propose a total of 2 mentees in the first
year, 5 mentees in the second year, and six mentees per year in years 3-5. The program will have a
Basic/Translational Track and a Clinical Track, which reflects the strengths of our faculty and the
interests of our residents. The program will leverage the vast research opportunities and infrastructure of
the Perelman School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania, including the Abramson Cancer
Center. The program is a major priority of the Department of Surgery, which has a longstanding history of
training surgeon-scientists and academic leaders. The T32 Program will be managed by the Program
Director, 2 Associate Program Directors, and a Steering Committee, with input from highly experienced
advisors (3 internal and 2 external). The 16 mentors are based in Surgery and 8 other departments. The
mentors have active funding, a track record of mentoring, and expertise in a wide variety of disciplines,
including tumor immunology, cancer cell biology, cancer imaging, and clinical cancer research. The
proposed curriculum is robust and will be tailored to the specific needs of each trainee. There will be
instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research, grant writing workshops, oral presentation skill
sessions, and journal clubs. T32 trainees will also have the opportunity to obtain an advanced degree,
such as a Masters in Translational Medicine or Clinical Epidemiology, and even a PhD. Our department
has several initiatives to promote diversity through the recruitment of women and underrepresented
minorities."

Excess risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) persists among Black and Latino older
adults, a population projected to more than double by 2060. ADRD prevention research has focused on individual
factors such as hypertension, with less attention to environmental determinants. Yet both the distribution of
individual factors and the effects of individual factors are potentially shaped by features of the residential
environment—such as green space, air pollution, ambient temperature, noise, walkability, neighborhood
amenities, access to transit, and neighborhood deprivation. Environmental factors may acutely shape ADRD risk
in Black and Latino communities affected by unequal opportunities due to systemic racism. Combinations of
environmental- and individual-level factors may exacerbate vulnerability with age to cognitive decline and loss
of instrumental and basic activities of daily living (ADLs) which are dependent on cognition.
Prior evidence on environmental factors and ADRD risk comes from predominantly White samples, and
evaluates one factor at a time, even though environmental factors are experienced in combination. These
exposure combinations are part of the exposome—the totality of environmental exposures that are experienced
across the life-course. Studies on how the exposome shapes individual-level risk factors for ADRD risk
are unusual, and studies that compare across racial/ethnic groups are scarce.
To address this significant gap, we propose to link time-varying high-resolution environmental metrics to five
NIH-funded racially and ethnically diverse cohorts in the US: Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the REasons
for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life
Experiences (KHANDLE) cohort, the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR), and the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; combined N=82,500). This study will evaluate how the exposome shapes the
risk of cognitive decline (Aim 1), independence loss in ADLs (Aim 2) and MRI biomarkers of brain atrophy (Aim
3) in racially/ethnically diverse groups.6 Our central hypothesis is that protective environmental conditions
(high levels of green space, walkability, neighborhood amenities, and access to transit, and low levels
of air pollution, ambient temperature, noise, and neighborhood deprivation) will be associated with
better cognitive outcomes, better individual risk factors, and attenuated effects of individual risk factors
on cognitive outcomes decades later. We anticipate the benefits of environmental resources for reducing
ADRD will be stronger among Black and Latino adults than White participants. The proposed study will identify
modifiable environmental factors that may reduce racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD. The comprehensive
multi-dimensional spatial datasets developed in this project will be applicable to other epidemiological studies
that consider biological and behavioral pathways through which the environment affects ADRD risk."

Arthropod-borne disease continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The ability of
an arthropod to harbor and transmit pathogens is termed “vector competency”. Many factors influence vector
competency, including how the arthropod immune system responds to the microbe. The intricacies of insect
immunity have been well-studied owing the model organism, Drosophila. In contrast, comparatively little is known
about tick immunity, representing a fundamental knowledge gap in vector biology. Arthropod immune processes
are now increasingly recognized as being divergent across species. For example, we identified a noncanonical
Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway in ticks that limits colonization of two bacterial pathogens: Borrelia burgdorferi
(Lyme disease) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis). Ticks lack genes
encoding upstream IMD pathway regulators. Therefore, the molecular and cellular events preceding the
noncanonical IMD pathway in ticks deviate from the classical paradigm defined in insects. We asked in our
previously funded R21 whether a specialized stress-response system termed the Unfolded Protein Response
(UPR) could impact vector competency through tick immunity. Infection imparts stress on the host and, for this
reason, cellular stress-responses are tightly intertwined with innate immunity. Our data shows that the UPR is
induced by tick-borne bacteria and initiates the noncanonical IMD pathway in ticks. Through RNAi knockdown
and pharmacological manipulation, we show that the IRE1α branch of the UPR signals through the adapter
molecule TRAF2 to restrict vector colonization by A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi both in vitro and in vivo.
Collectively, our findings provide an explanation for how the core IMD pathway is activated independent of
canonical upstream regulators. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that the UPR functionally
regulates vector-microbe interactions through crosstalk with the IMD pathway. AIM 1 of this proposal will now
investigate the role of the I. scapularis UPR on microbial growth, migration kinetics through tick tissues and/or
transmission to a naïve host. AIM 2 will uncover the mechanistic linkage between the UPR and the noncanonical
IMD pathway using an unbiased approach to define and characterize the signalosome during infection. Since
microbial infections impart stress on host systems and cellular stress responses are well conserved across
eukaryotes, we expect that the findings from this R01 will uncover novel determinants of vector competence and
may have broad relevance to many arthropod-pathogen systems."

This grant proposal describes a five-year mentored training program for the career development of Dr. Jocelyn
Kim, a physician-scientist, who will develop cutting-edge methods to quantify the HIV reservoir and investigate
novel therapies to cure HIV infection. She has recently discovered that natural killer (NK) cells delays viral
rebound in a sophisticated humanized mouse model of HIV latency. She has also found that anti-HIV chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR)-on NK cells efficiently kill HIV-infected cells in vitro. In addition, a novel synthetic latency
reactivating agent (LRA) activates latent HIV in the presence of ART in vivo. Importantly, she has innovated a
genetically barcoded reporter HIV-1 and demonstrated that this diverse virus swarm is replication-competent
and pathogenic in vivo and forms a latent reservoir, which rebounds after cessation of antiretroviral therapy
(ART). She will use this novel barcoded-virus tool to accurately quantify the number of latently infected clones
in vivo. These preliminary data are the basis of the current proposal, which involves the completion of the
following aims. First, she will investigate whether NK cells from peripheral blood or hematopoietic stem cell
progenitors (HSCPs) are more effective in delaying HIV rebound in vivo using new methods of stem cell
differentiation and analysis. Second, she will test of efficacy of CAR-NK cells versus CAR-T cells on viral rebound
in vivo. Lastly, she will use state-of-the-art approach in genetic barcoded virus to determine whether
combinatorial therapies (LRA and NK cell-based therapies) affect the HIV reservoir in vivo. With K08 funding,
she we will complete these studies with the intention of deepening our understanding of HIV pathogenesis and
curative strategies. Dr. Kim is currently an assistant clinical professor in the UCLA Division of Infectious Diseases
and recent graduate of the UCLA Specialty Training and Advanced Research (STAR) program, from which she
received a PhD in Biology and Biological Engineering from California Institute of Technology under her PhD
advisor Dr. David Baltimore. During the proposed award period, she will continue under the primary mentorship
of Dr. Jerome Zack at UCLA with additional mentorship through an advisory committee comprised of Drs. Gay
Crooks (UCLA), Alex Hoffman (UCLA) and Judith Currier (UCLA). With their guidance, she will attain the
necessary research and career skills to apply successfully for independent funding and transition to
independence. As such, through her collaborations as well as didactic training, she will expand her NK cell
project and use complex computational skills for high-throughout barcode sequencing analysis to understand
the HIV reservoir. She will also acquire new skills in stem cell differentiation and analysis, molecular cloning,
and writing and grantsmanship. K08 funding will allow her to develop all of the skills and tools needed to become
a successful independent investigator."

Despite the recognition of health disparities in obesity, behavioral interventions among low-income and
minority populations have consistently met with limited success. This is partially explained by social
determinants of health. Constantly changing barriers at the household and community levels impede consistent
engagement in healthy behaviors. The current proposal tests a novel, culturally-tailored and multi-level
intervention designed to teach families to overcome dynamic barriers as the logical next step to address
obesity among low-income Latino families. It is based on the premise that by implementing a personalized
multi-level intervention that simultaneously addresses healthy weight for parents and children, we will improve
body mass index (BMI) among Latino parent-child pairs.
COACH (COmpetency-Based Approaches to Community Health) implements a personally tailored approach,
equipping families to engage in health behaviors despite dynamic barriers. COACH is a multi-level intervention
targeting 1) the individual child through developmentally appropriate health behavior curriculum, 2) the family
by addressing parent weight loss directly and engaging parents as agents of change for their children, and 3)
the community by building capacity of Parks and Rec centers to offer parent-child programming. Using novel
multi-component assessments throughout the study, the intervention identifies individual, family, and
community barriers to healthy behaviors and delivers structured yet personalized intervention content in 7
domains: fruits/vegetables, snacks, sugary drinks, physical activity, sleep, media use, and parenting.
Building on a successful pilot, this proposal will implement a randomized controlled trial to test the
effectiveness of COACH compared to an attention-matched school-readiness control group. We will enroll 300
parent-child pairs from Latino communities in Nashville, TN. Eligible children will be 3-5 years old and have a
BMI >50th percentile. Through our 10-year partnership with the Nashville Parks and Rec department, we
conduct COACH in neighborhood community centers, leveraging community infrastructure to facilitate health
behavior change. The primary outcome will be child BMI change at 2-year follow-up, using a growth curve
analysis. Secondary outcomes will include parent BMI, and parent/child diet and physical activity. The goals of
COACH are to 1) implement a novel personalized behavioral intervention, 2) test a two-generation solution to
obesity, 3) address health disparities by reducing obesity among Latino families, and 4) develop a scalable and
widely accessible approach to behavioral obesity interventions by delivering them in Parks and Rec centers."
10875404,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite advances in high-throughput screening methods leading to a surge in the discovery of catalytic
reactions, our knowledge of the molecular-level interactions in the rate- and selectivity-determining steps of
catalytic reactions involving highly unstable and reactive open-shell intermediates is rudimentary. These
knowledge gaps prevent control, suppression or enhancement, of competing reaction channels that can drive
development of new catalytic reactions. Built on strong computational and experimental preliminary results, this
program seeks to understand and guide design of new sustainable, catalytic, and asymmetric transformations.
 Overall, our goals are to develop predictive models of reactivity and selectivity of first-row, open-shell
transition metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formations that can be adapted by the organic, organometallic,
and bio(in)organic community in the synthesis of medicinally-active compounds. To accomplish this
overarching goal, we have identified two areas of research for the next 5 years and plans for beyond. In the
first area, we will use combined experimental and computational tools to understand and develop new
asymmetric iron-catalyzed radical cascade/cross-coupling reactions. In the second area, through collaborative
efforts, we will target the synthesis of quaternary centers via metallophotoredox-catalyzed cross-couplings.
These reactions proceed through carbon-centered radical intermediates, open-shell organometallic species,
and photoexcited electronic state species where evaluating the mechanisms has been historically hampered
by the inherent complexity associated with the high reactivity and instability of these species. High-level
quantum mechanical calculations, rigorously calibrated against experimental data, will be used to interrogate
the mechanisms and to guide the development of new catalysts and reagents for currently sluggish or
unselective reactions. In addition, we will exploit selected potential energy surfaces susceptible to dynamic
effects, single-electron transfers, and intersystem crossings to gain a deeper understanding of the factors
determining product selectivity and inform catalyst and reaction design. Overall, these efforts will push the
limits of accurate molecular modeling of increasing complex catalytic reactions and potentially impact the fields
of organic, bio(in)organic, and transition-metal catalysis."

 Suicide attempts increased by 73% among Black adolescents, and suicide attempts
requiring hospitalization increased by 122% for Black adolescent boys between the years 1991-
2017. Many suicidal Black youth are unidentified, fewer than half are referred to treatment
following an emergency department visit, and many referred youth do not adhere to treatment.
Yet, prior research has not examined the effectiveness of a system of care for Black youth that
combines suicide risk screening with an intervention to enhance linkage to quality mental health
services. Our goal is to increase risk identification, treatment referral and engagement, and, in
turn, reduce suicidal ideation and behavior among Black youth, addressing NIMH goals for this
RFA and, more broadly, the National Action Alliance goals for youth suicide. The study’s aims
are to: 1) Inform and facilitate implementation of a system of care for Black youth at risk for
suicide who present to the ED by assessing multiple stakeholders’ (youth, parents, clinicians,
support staff, administrators) perspectives regarding the WeCare system of care. We will use
established implementation science frameworks to: a) determine barriers, facilitators, and
recommended adaptations to WeCare before, during, and after the trial; b) ascertain WeCare
acceptability and feasibility; and c) produce a WeCare implementation package that trains
existing clinicians in the WeCare system of care through a user-friendly manual, training
protocol, and fidelity assessment, and 2) Conduct a randomized clinical effectiveness trial with
2,200 Black Youth at risk for suicide to examine the effectiveness of WeCare. Approximately
4,257 youth, ages 12 to 17 years, enrolled from two hospital EDs in New York City, will be
assessed on enrollment for risks associated with suicide, and moderate/high risk youth will be
randomly assigned to WeCare vs. usual services. Survey assessments will be conducted at 3-,
and 6-month follow-up, with medical record review through 12 months. As exploratory aims, we
will a) examine whether impacts of WeCare are moderated by youth sex, sexual or gender
minority status, age (12-14, 15-17 years), and baseline risk for suicidality; b) conduct a cost
effectiveness analysis to inform implementation, and c) understand how level of suicide risk
(assessed via the CASSY) is associated with treatment engagement among those youth
assigned to WeCare."
10875407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Psychostimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are the second most
prescribed medication class for long-term use in children and adolescents. These medications have long been
known to impede linear growth, however, recent preclinical research has shown that they also reduce
appendicular bone mineral content (BMC) and bone quality in young rats. This is mediated by an increase in
osteoclast differentiation and activity, promoting bone resorption. In children and adolescents, the use of
psychostimulants has also been associated with clinically significant lower dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA)-based BMC and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the lumbar spine (LS) and hip, in a dose-
dependent manner. In addition, our group has found that boys chronically-treated with psychostimulants may
have lower LS aBMD velocity Z-scores compared to those not taking psychostimulants.
 Given that bone mass accrued by young adulthood may determine fracture risk later in life, this application
seeks to examine the skeletal effects of psychostimulants in children and adolescents and examine whether
sex and pubertal development are significant moderators. Specifically, we propose to enroll otherwise
medically healthy 7 to 16 year-olds within one month of starting psychostimulants and unmedicated. In this
observational study, we will monitor skeletal outcomes over a one-year period, with repeated DXA and high-
resolution pQCT (HRpQCT) scans, along with a thorough assessment of psychopathology and of factors
known to affect bone mineral accrual. This design will allow us to prospectively asses the effects of
psychostimulants on bone mass accrual and bone microarchitecture in children and adolescents (Aim 1).
Given that peak bone accrual velocity in boys is nearly double that in girls and that that bone mass increases
exponentially during puberty, we also seek to evaluate whether sex and stages of sexual maturity moderate
this effect (Aim 2). Secondary analyses will examine the impact of these medications on additional DXA- and
HRpQCT-based outcomes.
 This study will be the first to prospectively examine whether psychostimulants impair bone mineral accrual
during purberty, increasing one's risk for low bone mass later in life. This information is key to designing
appropriate interventions to mitigate this risk and to helping clinicians and families make informed decisions
about treatment options most suitable for the patient's needs."

The proposed research and training plan are designed to promote my development as an independent
investigator in the field of neighborhood characteristics as they relate to conversion to psychosis through
neurobiological and psychosocial mediators among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Urban
upbringing (growing up in cities as compared to rural areas) is one of the strongest environmental risk factors
for schizophrenia. More recent studies have suggested that social stress might explain this association. In
particular, neighborhood residential instability (NRI) has been used to measure social fragmentation and has
also been associated with increased schizophrenia rates and prevalence. In addition, my published work found
that NRI predicts an earlier age at onset of psychosis among individuals with first-episode psychosis even after
controlling for known risk factors. Furthermore, my preliminary data indicate that county-level residential
instability (a rough proxy for NRI) during childhood 1) predicts conversion to psychosis and 2) predicts smaller
corticolimbic gray matter volume (GMV) among a subset of youth at CHR-P who never moved. Dr. Walker (one
of my mentors) has shown that psychosocial deprivation as measured by reduced childhood peer
relationships, parental absence, and emotional neglect is associated with smaller corticolimbic GMV, whereas
threat (defined as exposures that involve harm; e.g., childhood sexual and physical abuse) is not. Based on
these findings, I hypothesize that NRI leads to psychosocial deprivation, which in turn contributes to smaller
corticolimbic GMV, which ultimately increases risk for psychosis. To test this hypothesis, I propose the
following Specific Aims: (1) Test the association between NRI and conversion to psychosis and corticolimbic
GMV, including the cortical, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampal GMV and control regions
including insula and thalamus. (2) Test the association between NRI and psychosocial deprivation and threat.
(3) Explore the experiences and circumstances of youth at CHR-P living in residential areas that differ in NRI,
from very unstable to highly stable. The proposed studies will provide a novel integration of multiple levels of
investigation including public health, developmental studies in humans, and the impact of environmental
factors on the brain and behavior to discover novel targets for intervention both at the individual and
neighborhood levels to prevent or mitigate psychosis conversion in high-risk individuals. Future research will
further elucidate the relationship of neighborhood characteristics with the psychosocial and neurobiological
factors associated with risk for psychosis, such as investigating whether NRI exposure at specific
developmental periods and regional brain changes would have a differential impact on psychosis. If NRI leads
to psychosocial deprivation and neurobiological changes, for example, targeted psychosocial interventions
could then be designed for youth at risk. In addition, geographic identification of at-risk groups could guide
allocation of mental health resources to areas with greater psychosis risk for early intervention."

Mental health problems such as autism are highly prevalent in the population and incur great suffering and
financial costs. Yet there is currently a dearth of biomarkers that accurately predict their diagnosis or
prognosis. Characterizing the contributions of high-dimensional biomarkers to susceptibility of such complex
disorders is critically important for advancing our understanding of their etiology and for developing new
treatments. The fraction of variance explained (FVE) by a set of biomarkers is a measure of the total amount of
information for an outcome contained in the predictor variables. It is a fundamental quantity in much of mental
health-related research, e.g., human microbiome, proteomics, gene expression, etc. Canonical examples
where the FVE is of fundamental interest include Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and
neuroimaging, both crucial tools for understanding the biological basis of mental health disorders. GWAS have
successfully mapped thousands of genetic factors by mass-univariate association of millions of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but the top significant associations, even in aggregate, account for only a
small proportion of susceptibility. To assess the amount of information in GWAS, the SNP-heritability, h2SNP,
quantifies the FVE among all GWAS SNPs in aggregate, regardless of significance. Similarly, the FVE by brain
imaging measures captures variation in the brain related to mental illness, which again appears to be highly
distributed. In both the genetic and brain imaging domains, the number of predictors is extremely large, in the
order of thousands to millions, far larger than the number of subjects. As a result, the specific associations with
each predictor unit cannot be estimated, and effects of specific loci are extremely difficult to identify. In
contrast, the FVE can be reliably estimated from data, even if only univariate summary statistics are available.
Estimating FVE requires sophisticated statistical methods designed for these particular, high-dimensional data.
In this proposal, we propose a general framework for FVE estimation, applicable to high-dimensional data
including both GWAS and brain imaging settings. We develop foundational theory establishing the validity and
consistency of FVE estimation, develop new methods for evaluating the required conditions in real data, and
develop methods for partitioning FVE into more local components, allowing understanding of the distribution of
contributions to susceptibility in a top-down approach. We apply these methods to the Adolescent Brain
Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, comprising longitudinal, multi-modal brain imaging, GWAS data, and
autism-related assessments for 11,875 participants aged 9-10 at baseline and continuing into early adulthood."

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a chronic, impairing condition that typically emerges during adolescence and
affects about 10% of the population. Treatment response rates for SAD are markedly lower than for other anxiety
disorders, thus presenting an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets that can inform new interventions
for this difficult-to-treat disorder. We propose to address this need by testing a developmentally-informed,
mechanistic model of the escalation of impairing social anxiety symptoms (SA) in early-to-mid adolescence; our
model centers on Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE) and Hypervigilance for Errors in the presence of peers, with
a focus on frontal brain oscillations as central to this escalation. Adolescence represents a sensitive period for
the development of social cognition and cognitive control. At the psychological level, social fears and FNE exhibit
normative increases across adolescence, given the increasing importance of peers during this developmental
window. At the neural level, frontal brain systems underlying social cognition and cognitive control exhibit
protracted development across adolescence, including development of the frontal cortex and associated 4-8 Hz
“theta” oscillations causally implicated in cognitive control. Our central hypothesis is that adolescent increases
in FNE, alongside development of the frontal cortex, create a maladaptive feedback loop: adolescents become
Hypervigilant to Errors in social settings, further increasing FNE, and ultimately, impairing SA. Our model predicts
(Aim 1) that developmental increases in FNE lead to increased concerns over performance in the presence of
peers, which in turn amplifies Hypervigilance for Errors (that is, increased strength of error-related theta
oscillations). We further predict (Aim 2) that increased Hypervigilance for Errors leads to more critical self-
evaluations and confirmations of initial fears, which worsen FNE/SA over time. Moreover, we predict adolescents
who exhibit greater synchrony in theta oscillations across medial-lateral frontal cortex are at greatest risk and
will display the largest increases in FNE/SA. To test our model, we will collect an accelerated longitudinal study
of 256 adolescents, spanning ages 11-15, biologically male/female, and ranging in FNE/SA. Participants will
complete a modified cognitive control task in peer presence/absence (via Zoom) as EEG is recorded. With an
eye toward future translational work, we will also (Aim 3) establish the ecological validity of our neural measures
by testing links to micro-coded behaviors indicative of SA within a social interaction task. Given that escalation
of SA occurs during puberty and within a broader social context, we will also measure, control for, and explore
the possible moderating roles of puberty, as well as effects of social and demographic variables. A key strength
of this proposal is that our team has a proven record in developmental psychopathology and experimental
therapeutics, providing a clear path for translating findings from this project into novel, brain-based therapeutics
and thereby shortening the distance “from bench to bedside.”"

 Understanding the information contained within the human genome has been a goal of molecular biology
and medicine since the identification of DNA. The Human Genome Project cataloged all the protein-coding genes
embedded within the genome, but gene-finding algorithms had a blind spot for protein-coding small open reading
frames (smORFs). Technological advances over the last decade have led to the discovery of thousands of
smORFs in the human genome that encode peptides or small proteins (median length 30 amino acids)
collectively referred to as microproteins. The discovery of thousands of previously unknown proteins in the
human genome is an exciting opportunity in molecular biology that promises to improve scientific understanding
and the ability to discover and develop new medicines.
 This proposal seeks to answer important questions that have emerged regarding microproteins, including
whether microproteins from polycistronic genes are functional (Aim 1), whether biologically active secreted
microproteins exist (Aim 2), and, lastly, whether it is possible to use knowledge about the structure and
mechanism of microproteins to develop small-molecule probes that can regulate their actives in cells (Aim 3).
These questions will be tackled using approaches and reagents developed over the last decade. For example,
optimized robust protocols are now available for investigating microprotein-protein interactions together with
necessary reagents including antibodies, cell lines, and genetically engineered mice to study these unique
genes. This proposal will reveal new functions for microproteins in cells and tissues, identify biologically active
secreted microproteins, and identify small molecule probes of microprotein biology.
 These efforts will increase understanding of the roles of smORFs and microproteins in mammalian
genomes and identify secreted microproteins and small molecules that provide a template for converting these
foundational discoveries into medicines."

 A central theme of research in the Cheng group is focused on basic understanding of how biomolecules
and/or molecular assemblies function in space and time to drive life. For example, how does the membrane
respond to the action potential in neurons? How is the metabolism remodelled during cell development or cancer
progression? What happens to the chemistry inside a microorganism when exposed to a drug treatment?
Answering these questions has broad implications for diagnosing and treating conditions ranging from infectious
diseases to metastatic cancers. Towards this mission, Cheng and his team invent and apply highly sensitive
chemical imaging technologies that are able to unveil hidden signatures in various living systems. The eventual
goal is to enable molecule-based precision diagnosis and/or treatment of human diseases. The Cheng team
further harnesses and manipulates the unique properties of photons to modulate the behaviour of cells. Two
focused projects are photolysis of chromophores to eradicate drug-resistant bacteria and optoacoustic
modulation of neural tissues at ultrahigh spatial precision. Overall, with integrated expertise in engineering,
physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and entrepreneurship, the research team is devoted to three integrated
thrusts: (1) Inventing label-free optical modulation and spectroscopic imaging technologies and pushing their
physical limits; (2) Discovering molecular signatures that define cellular state and functions; (3) Converting label-
free technologies and biological discoveries into molecule-based precision diagnosis and treatments.
 During the past 5 years (2013 to 2018), research by Cheng and co-workers has pushed the boundary of
vibrational spectroscopic imaging in terms of speed, spectral bandwidth, imaging depth, and detection sensitivity
(for a review, Science, 2015, 350: aaa8870). In parallel, via collaborations, Cheng and co-workers discovered
significant metabolic signatures defining cancer aggressiveness (Cell Metabolism 2014), cancer cell stemness
(Cell Stem Cell 2017), and antimicrobial resistance (Anal Chem 2017), as well as a spectroscopic indicator of
membrane voltage in neurons (JPC Lett 2017). The overarching goal of this MIRA proposal is to further push
the boundary of nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic imaging platforms in order to unveil the signatures that
underlie initiation or progression of human diseases by “watching the orchestra of molecules” in real space and
time inside a living system. Cheng and co-workers will pursue this goal by advancing the capability of two
complimentary vibrational imaging platforms, namely multiplex stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and
infrared photothermal microscopy both invented in the Cheng lab, to reach single-molecule detection sensitivity,
100-nm spatial resolution, volumetric mapping at high speed, and deep-tissue penetration. As a focused
application, the team will deploy the developed technologies to advance the basic understanding of how a
biological cell reprograms its metabolism during development in vivo or in response to a stress."

obesity
impacts 2.7 million American children. Children from racial/ethnic minority and low-income
 have higher obesity prevalence, contributing to health disparities. Obesity reduction efforts focused
individual health behavior change have seen limited success, resulting in calls to examine social and
factors that contribute to obesity. A better understanding of complex risk factors for childhood
can inform targeted interventions, clinical practice, and policy.
1
Adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs) are one understudied complex risk factor for childhood obesity. ACEs are traumatic experiences
that occur during childhood such as sexual abuse, family member incarceration, or witnessing violent crime.
Almost half of children have experienced ACEs and populations with ACEs have higher obesity prevalence.
ACEs can increase obesity risk via sequelae of chronic or severe stress or by hindering healthy behaviors,
though the impact of ACEs on childhood obesity is not well understood. Multi-level research examining the
influence of neighborhood environment on the ACEs-obesity relationships is particularly lacking.
Neighborhood factors such as lack of access to healthcare and high crime may contribute to both ACEs and
obesity via indirect and overlapping pathways. It is difficult to disentangle the impact of neighborhood factors
because many co-occur within the broader context of neighborhood poverty and racial segregation;
sophisticated approaches such as geospatial analysis, longitudinal research, and novel methods for
quantifying neighborhood risk are necessary. This study will be the first to examine the relationship
between neighborhood environment, ACEs, and childhood obesity using advanced statistical methods.
Aims 1a and 1b entail development and testing of a neighborhood ACEs index using existing multi-level
geospatial data. Aim 2 entails examining the relationship between the neighborhood ACEs index and childhood
obesity incidence using existing longitudinal data. Aim 3 entails determining neighborhood factors most
associated with ACEs exposure and childhood obesity in order to identify potential targets for intervention,
clinical practice, and policy. This study has the potential to inform targeted efforts for improving the
health of millions of children who experience ACEs and obesity. The associated Career Development
Plan focuses on ACEs, advanced statistics, and geospatial analysis. The Plan will advance my ability to use
diverse, multi-level, geospatial data to examine complex childhood obesity risk factors - a skillset rare
among nurse scientists but directly relevant to my research on how social determinants of health impact
obesity. The Plan includes expert mentorship, focused coursework, and training at the inaugural NICHD P50
Translational Center for Child Maltreatment Studies. Collectively, this study will advance knowledge about
the impact of ACEs on childhood obesity and simultaneously further my career goal to establish a
program of research on understanding and reducing childhood obesity disparities."

expanded a chemical and microbiological tests plan, which is more complex, highly customized,
significantly more costly, and time-consuming than anticipated in the Company’s original submission.

effectiveness of the agents in oral liquid formulations designed to minimize microbial proliferation when
filled, stored, and dispensed through our COPA device and (2) Interior Fluidic Path Reprocessing Efficacy
(cleaning and intermediate level disinfection). These additional FDA concerns also resulted in a cascade
of updates/changes to the device software, device file documentation, Instructions for Use documents,
internal bench testing protocols, the design of the human factors study, and the need to produce more

 Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are critical for diagnostic radiology and are used in about 40%
of all magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, representing over 12 million administrations in the US
per year. GBCAs provide vital insight in detecting and staging different cancers, multiple sclerosis, aneurysms
and vascular blockages. In patients with poor renal function a single GBCA administration can cause
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a very painful and debilitating fibrosing condition in which gadolinium (Gd)
deposits are found in the skin and internal organs. Patients with normal renal function are also prone to Gd
retention and can experience NSF-like symptoms. Despite a switch to more chemically stable macrocyclic
GBCAs, Gd has been detected in brain, bone, heart and liver from biopsy and autopsy tissue, but its clinical
significance remains to be fully understood. A key issue is that we lack the ability to measure how much Gd
remains in the body after imaging, where it is retained, and how it is trafficked. At the preclinical stage, new
responsive GBCAs, whose relaxivity changes in response to a local stimulus like pH change, are emerging as
powerful tools to interrogate the pathological microenvironment. However decoupling relaxivity change from
concentration change in vivo has proven elusive, limiting the application of these responsive probes.
 I recently showed that yttrium-86 chelates are ideal surrogates for their corresponding GBCAs both in vitro
and in vivo. 86Y PET / GBCA MR is a noninvasive, highly sensitive technique that quantitatively reports on the in
vivo Gd concentration, distribution and speciation, and is readily translatable to humans. 86Y PET/MR enables
the measurement of in vivo relaxivity which informs on Gd speciation and can be used to measure biochemical
processes through the use of responsive MR probes. For example, extracellular pH (pHe) is a key marker of
tumor metabolism that can inform on prognosis and treatment response. In this proposal I will use 86Y PET/MR
to address three fundamental and unresolved questions surrounding existing and next generation GBCAs: 1) Is
there a GBCA that is more effectively eliminated and would therefore provide a safety benefit? 2) What is the
speciation, i.e. chemical and biological form(s), of the retained Gd and is there evidence of toxicity? And 3) can
simultaneous 86Y PET/MR enable quantitative molecular imaging with a responsive MR probe, specifically
measuring extracellular tumor pH with a pH-responsive MR probe.
 The output of this work will be the development of a quantitative PET/MR protocol to follow in vivo biochemical
processes non-invasively. This research will provide me with vital training in PET/MR imaging, biology and
pharmacokinetics, while leveraging my current skills in analytical, inorganic and radiochemistry."

Establishing smoke-free homes may be a promising approach to support, and perhaps catalyze, smoking
cessation. The inconvenience of going outside, combined with a reduction of environmental cues to smoke in
the home, may result in less smoking and increased efforts to quit. Yet, no rigorous studies have tested the
impact of creating smoke-free homes on cessation outside the context of protecting children from secondhand
smoke exposure. We have developed a brief smoke-free homes intervention, “Some Things are Better
Outside”, that is very effective in promoting the adoption of total smoking bans in low-income households. As
part of NCI’s State and Community Tobacco Control research initiative, we conducted an efficacy trial, an
effectiveness trial, a generalizability trial and a dissemination trial with positive outcomes in each phase of the
research. Pooled data from our three RCTs, combined with results from a national dissemination study,
document the potential of the intervention to support cessation. We propose to partner with two large federally
qualified health centers (FQHCs) in rural south Georgia to rigorously test the efficacy and potential scalability
of integrating a smoke-free homes intervention into the 5A (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) approach for
tobacco cessation recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. FQHCs serve as the safety net
of primary care for vulnerable populations in the U.S. Most FQHC patients are socioeconomically
disadvantaged and represent a high priority for cessation. Developing and testing an approach for integrating
the intervention into FQHCs from the outset should increase potential use of the intervention if proven
effective. Our first aim is to adapt the intervention for integration into the 5As for tobacco cessation, followed by
an RCT to test the efficacy of integrating the smoke-free homes intervention into the 5A approach for smoking
cessation among FQHC patients. This approach may have broader reach than current approaches as it may
appeal to those not yet ready to quit, as well as provide a social and physical personal environment that
supports increased quit attempts and successful cessation. We also plan to conduct a multi-component
process evaluation that examines implementation outcomes, cost and scalability potential. The proposed
research will be the first to rigorously assess whether the integration of a strong smoke-free homes intervention
into the 5As can encourage sustained smoking cessation in low-income patients."

Diversion of ADHD stimulants, by sharing, selling, or trading, is the primary conduit by which these Schedule II
controlled drugs reach their peak prevalence of misuse in early adulthood (use without a prescription, overuse
of prescribed medication). Yet, understanding of stimulant diversion and contributing factors is limited to
speculation from small cross-sectional studies. Dramatically increased rates of stimulant prescribing in recent
years (from ~49.2 to 62.8M people), mainly in adults, has heightened concern. The state- of-science on this
important topic precludes development of prevention efforts based on variables with inferred causal influence.
Additionally, although primary care is the most common treatment setting for ADHD, this population and its risk
for diversion in adulthood, including when diagnosis and treatment occurs after childhood, is poorly
understood. Due to concern about these trends and reports of associated physical dangers and legal
consequences, the FDA recently established a public docket requesting comments on the potential role of
abuse- deterrent stimulant formulations. The accompanying review stated a need for information on factors
that would inform their decision-making, including characterization of longitudinal pathways to misuse. The
proposed study prospectively examines stimulant diversion and hypothesized risk factors among young adults
at peak age for stimulant diversion: those initially diagnosed and stimulant-treated in early adulthood, and
those stimulant-treated as adolescents by pediatricians and aging now into early adulthood. The combined
sample will provide a unique opportunity to examine associations between timing of ADHD treatment, stimulant
diversion, and hypothesized risk factors. N=357 adolescents stimulant-treated for ADHD in primary care (U01
DA040213), and 150 newly recruited young adults first diagnosed and treated in adulthood, will be studied
(total n = 507). Three annual assessments will span ages 18-24 to allow prospective study of stimulant
diversion during the age period of its greatest prevalence. Self- and parent-report and behavioral economics
tasks will be used to assess intrapersonal, attitudinal-behavioral, and social-normative risk factors and
environmental moderators (parenting and provider factors). The results of this study will aide Priority Focus
Area #3 of NIDA’s 2016-2020 Strategic Plan, “Addressing Real World Complexities” by generating findings that
will apply to two of the largest, least understood segments of the treated ADHD population—those treated in
primary care, and those young adult-diagnosed. Findings will provide crucially needed prospectively gathered
data to inform the development of stimulant diversion prevention efforts."

Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing
relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle
in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly
understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and
composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology,
microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients
with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip
strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such
measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development.
We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field
MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with
unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of
intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3)
to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2
relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid
composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle
function.
This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2
relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method
easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of
intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of
these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The
significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the
weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting
conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in
the development of future treatments for this condition."
10877016,"The stress hormone, cortisol, coordinates the body’s chronic metabolism, but also coordinates acute responses to stress by
regulating stem cell differentiation in different tissues, restraining inflammatory and immune responses from being
hyperactive, and coordinates acute metabolic responses to nutrient composition and feeding or fasting. Cortisol is also
known as a glucocorticoid because it controls glucose metabolism. Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are wide used for
reducing pain and inflammation across many diseases, but can cause insulin resistance, muscle atrophy, and osteoporosis.
We have developed an approach to studying GCs that enables us to understand how the glucocorticoid receptor coordinates
these activities by binding to specific genes and changing the proteins made by those genes to control tissue-selective
activity. This occurs as the GCs bind to the receptor and change its shape, enabling it to interact with different enzymes that
control transcription. Previous efforts to understand these processes have been hampered by the fact that most of the existing
GCs that we study are very similar. We instead make GCs that have a full range of desirable and undesirable activities,
which gives us the statistical variance to understand them, a technique we call ligand class analysis, as we identify different
classes of GC ligands that interact with different transcriptional regulatory enzymes to control expression of specific genes.
Another major barrier has been the very wide expertise needed to understand the links between the GC chemical structure,
receptor structure, the interacting coregulators, the regulated genes, and the tissue selective activities. We have assembled
the required expertise and approaches to overcome these barriers by studying GC action on skeletal muscle, stem cell
differentiation into bone, inflammation, and immune responses to colitis. We will use a chemical systems biology approach
with novel GCs along with an integrative structural biology platform to define the signaling code for the glucocorticoid
receptor in these aims: Aim 1 Biology: Identify which GC effects are correlated and which can be separated using
physiologically relevant biology for the study of skeletal muscle, T cell differentiation, inflammation, and colitis, and
osteoblast mineralization and effects on bone. Aim 2 Chemistry: Development of GCs to perturb GR structure and function
in novel ways. We will enlarge three classes of compounds based on specific structural hypotheses to enlarge the chemical-
structural space and test a novel steroidal scaffold to access new chemical space. Chemistry will focus on creating a diversity
of effects on bone versus skeletal muscle while maintaining anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds. Aim 3 Structure:
identify the structural underpinnings of selective GC signaling. We will apply machine learning and regression approaches
to our structural and biological data to build and test models defining the mechanisms drive tissue-selectivity and identify
which processes are globally coordinated to control differentiation and stress responses at an organismal level.
Understanding the structural and molecular mechanisms of selective modulation will lead to breakthrough understandings
of allostery and the development of improved GCs for medicine."
10877142,"Project Summary. Streptococccus mutans is a ubiquitous oral bacterium and prominent etiologic agent of
human dental caries. Certain strains can also cause bacterial endocarditis and invade human coronary
epithelial cells. US health care costs associated with dental decay alone are over $64 billion annually. This
project addresses membrane protein insertion in S. mutans. A semi-permeable lipid bilayer membrane
encloses all cells and determines cellular function by dictating what can cross by virtue of proteins embedded
within differing lipid milieus. S. mutans shares features common to other bacterial membrane protein insertion
systems, and those of eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and organelles, but also exhibits unique properties.
S. mutans is becoming an established model for studying protein transport in Gram+ bacteria. All known
regulatory circuits and multiple virulence attributes of S. mutans stem from its membrane protein composition.
Biological membranes are ~50% protein by mass and membrane proteins represent most known drug targets.
Thus understanding S. mutans protein transport and insertion pathways will facilitate targeted therapy against
this and related pathogens. This project focuses on co-translational protein transport including YidC insertases
(bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts), and the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway conserved in all
living cells. We identified respective S. mutans YidC1, YidC2, and SRP substrates and identified four pathway
frameworks: canonical SRP pathway, autonomous YidC pathway, coordinated YidC2-SRP pathway, and an
SRP-independent pathway in which YidC1 interacts with the SecYEG translocon and an uncharacterized
protein called Jag. We also characterized the cardiolipin-rich lipidome of the S. mutans membrane and
showed the influence of lipid composition on membrane partitioning of specific components of the transport
machinery. In this renewal application we will identify interactions of protein components of the transport
machinery with anionic lipids using Martini22 coarse-grain molecular dynamic simulation in conjunction with
circular dichroism, solution NMR, and biolayer interferometry (SA1). We will also evaluate protein-protein
interactions in the context of varying lipid milieus by molecular dynamic simulation, blue-native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and will utilize solid state NMR to evaluate protein-protein contacts and structures of
protein pairs and oligomers. Findings will be validated using insertion of epitope-tagged substrates in vivo, and
in vitro transcription-translation-insertion assays with customized proteoliposomes (SA2). Lastly, membrane-
localized Jag is a predicted RNA binding protein (RBP). Mitochondrial membrane-localized RBPs have
recently been shown to chaperone specific mRNAs for coupled translation-insertion. jag and rnpA encoding
ribonuclease P are in the same operon as yidC1. Therefore we will also evaluate the roles of Jag and RnpA in
post-transcriptional regulation of yidC1, yidC2, and genes encoding relevant substrates (SA3)."

10877963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this project is to forecast the impact of novel tobacco tax proposals in an evolving and complex
tobacco marketplace, including how these proposals may interact with tobacco-related socioeconomic
disparities and the introduction of low nicotine cigarettes (LNCs). Toward this end, we have developed the
Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) to estimate, before implementation, the effects of potential policies
on patterns of tobacco purchasing, including between-product substitution and poly-tobacco purchasing. The
ETM places the mix of products, prices, and specific regulations under experimental control to provide estimates
of policy impact under conditions that simulate “real-world” circumstances. Here we extend this method to
examine the impact of four novel tax proposals that levy taxes across products based on either: (1) parity, (2)
nicotine content, (3) potential for harm, or (4) the Food and Drug Administration designation as a modified-risk
tobacco product. To accomplish these objectives, we will leverage our extensive experience in the behavioral
economics of tobacco purchasing, in general, and with our unique and innovative ETM, in particular, to forecast
the impact and health equity of these tax proposals. Specifically, Aim 1 will examine the effects of these four tax
proposals on tobacco product purchasing in the ETM, including between-product substitution and poly-tobacco
purchasing, in a laboratory-based sample of cigarette smokers. Aim 2 will examine the equity of these tax
proposals by testing their effects in a nationally representative prospective sample of lower, medium and higher
socioeconomic status smokers. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the impact of these tax proposals when LNCs are
introduced to the market and when modeling a regulation that bans conventional cigarettes with higher nicotine
content in a laboratory-based sample of cigarette smokers. Overall, this project is highly innovative and impactful
because it prioritizes a clear translational path into public health policy and practice."

Despite the importance of myoblast fusion for normal muscle development and physiology, relatively little is
known about the molecules that directly function to remodel membranes during the myoblast fusion reaction.
Elucidation of fusion mechanisms is critical to fully understand muscle development and to identify novel
therapeutic strategies to augment skeletal muscle disease. We previously discovered that myomaker (Mymk)
and myomerger (Mymx) are essential for the fusion of skeletal muscle progenitors. Moreover, ectopic
expression of these two membrane proteins induces fusion of otherwise non-fusogenic cells (fibroblasts). For
the first time, this establishes a cell-based reconstitution system with myoblast fusogens, however many
questions exist as to how these two proteins induce fusion. We have recently found that myomaker and
myomerger drive fusion through a unique cellular mechanism, by dividing their independent membrane
remodeling activities to distinctly impact the fusion process. It stands to reason that the membrane-remodeling
activities of myomaker and myomerger must be highly regulated or they could have the potential to
compromise cellular integrity. Indeed, our preliminary experiments probing the requirement of myomaker for
fusion during dystrophic disease progression unexpectedly revealed that myomaker expression in dystrophic
myofibers is deleterious. In this project we will: 1) determine the membrane-remodeling activities of myomaker
that control lipid mixing (hemifusion) 2) identify and interrogate the additional factors required for hemifusion 3)
elucidate the mechanisms by which myomerger elicits membrane stresses that drive fusion pore formation.
Additionally, we will study these fusogens in the context of chronic muscle disease (muscular dystrophy). We
will use cell biology, biochemistry, and genetic mouse models to study and define the activities of myomaker
and myomaker, thereby elucidating the mechanisms of myoblast fusion. We will also develop a reconstituted
proteoliposome system for myoblast fusion. These studies will provide unique insight into the mechanisms of
mammalian myoblast fusion. Overall, this work promises to open up a new area of investigation into the cell
biology of muscle and positively impact the possibility to harness fusion to improve regenerative medicine."

Malignant cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal form of all skin cancers causing 10,000 deaths annually in the
United States and 200,000 globally and remains a major oncological problem. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) can
selectively infect, replicate and eradicate cancer cells with defective type I interferons (IFNs) mechanisms, a
major antiviral pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is a crucial survival regulator of cellular stress
and helps balance protein synthesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis to ensure the survival of resilient tumor cells.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a non-pathogenic, enveloped, negative-strand RNA Rhabdovirus with a potent
vaccine and oncolytic potential across multiple human cancer. VSV is highly sensitive to type-I interferons (IFNs);
therefore, it cannot initiate a productive infection in healthy cells due to IFNs mediated antiviral response.
Dysregulated IFNs and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cooperate in tumorigenesis related to many cancer types,
including melanoma. Moreover, PI3K or AKT inhibition diminishes cells' IFN-Is signatures. Therefore, we
hypothesize that local inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the tumors will create a needful
condition for the intratumoral spread of VSV and virus-induced cancer cell death resulting in tumor growth delay
and extension in survival in a mouse model of melanoma. Because of the adverse effects associated with VSVs,
we have engineered a novel hybrid VSV virus (VSV-MORV-G [VMG]), where the VSV envelops protein G and
is replaced with that of Morreton virus to improve their safety and potency. We recently identified fisetin, a natural
compound, and two of its potent derivatives, F019, F040 and F142, as inhibitors that competitively bind mTOR
and S6K1 kinase to inhibit the mTOR/AKT/IFN pathway. Furthermore, our preliminary data show increased
sensitivity and cytotoxicity of melanoma cells to oncolytic virus upon pre-therapy with fisetin while sparing normal
cells. Thus, we expect that locally turning off the type I IFN response and mTOR can serve as a novel pharmaco-
virotherapy for advanced localized melanoma. Novel outcomes stemming from the proposed investigations will
inform the role of local turning off of target pathways in the development/progression of melanoma, and will serve
as a catalyst to develop practical solutions for melanoma control and possibly other cancers with significant
public health burdens. Our aims are designed to test this innovative hypothesis in cell lines and preclinical animal
models of melanoma. Funding of this current application will enhance biomedical research, education and
infrastructure at the ULM College of Pharmacy. The proposed work will directly involve underrepresented
minorities and female students, and will sharpen their communication and presentation skills, and encourage
them to pursue careers as biomedical scientists in a primary undergraduate institution (PUI)."
10878839,"CORE C ABSTRACT
Patient-derived Xenograft (PDX) and Syngeneic Mouse Melanoma Core services.
Despite recent development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for metastatic human melanoma,
innate, adaptive and acquired resistance arise and limit clinical survival benefits. This core will subserve the
overarching goals and specific aims of each of the three Projects in this PPG. Defining resistance mechanisms
in an in vitro system is an important first step but is limited in its capacity to recapitulate inter- and intra-tumor
heterogeneity and incapable of reproducing immune and stromal environmental impacts. The development of
Patient-derived Xenograft (PDX) models that maintain the characteristics of the patient's tumor will ensure
clinical and in vivo relevance of proposed studies in each Project in this PPG. The PDX and murine melanoma
core aims to perform a prospective collection of tumor biopsies in order to create an extensive library of fully
characterized PDX models. The core will provide access to a biobank of PDX models that have been developed
from biopsy samples provided by the Core B and from outside collaborators as well as murine melanoma
models representing the genomic diversity of metastatic human melanoma. It will also generate models of
acquired resistance to currently FDA-approved or clinically-tested targeted therapies and key combinations proposed in
this PPG. We will also generate cell lines from PDX models to enable investigators of the Projects to perform
first-level mechanistic analyses. Finally, the core will generate a suite of temporal/spatial multi-omic data that
can be mined by each of the Projects to identifiy specific models that would be initially used as proof-of-
concepts and later to assemble panels with sufficient diversity to evaluate reproducibility or biologic effects
restricted to certain genomic, epigenomic or immunologic contexts."
10878861,"RP2 PROJECT SUMMARY
 Traditional models of the experience of persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias have
largely focused on the inexorable dwindling of physical and cognitive function. Recent research by our group,
others, and clinical experience suggest that persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
experience sudden serious adverse events that markedly alter disease trajectory. Such “disruptive events” can
include traumatic injuries such as hip fracture, medical events like pneumonia, or social or emotional
upheavals such as the death of a spouse. There is a critical need to understand the impact of disruptive events
on persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and families, including functional decline, survival,
and need for increased personal care, as well as their impact on the healthcare system, including healthcare
costs and service use. We will use the longitudinal, nationally representative Health and Retirement Study
linked to Medicare claims to characterize the incidence and impact of disruptive events on community-dwelling
persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. We will focus on three examples of disruptive events
that prior work suggests may differentially impact persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias: (1)
hip fracture (i.e. surgical crisis); (2) hospitalization for pneumonia (i.e. medical crisis); or (3) death of a spouse
(i.e. social crisis). We will examine the impact of these events on outcomes that are meaningful to patients,
families, and health systems by a) comparing trajectories and outcomes for persons without dementia who
experience disruptive events and b) comparing trajectories and outcomes for persons with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias experiencing or not experiencing disruptive events. Our specific aims are: (1) To
determine the incidence of the disruptive events among persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias; (2) To compare the impact of disruptive events in persons with and without Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias; and (3) To examine persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias who do
and do not experience disruptive events. The knowledge gained from this proposal will guide community-
dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, caregivers, and clinicians in decision making
and planning for outcomes following disruptive events, inform the design of interventions to prevent or delay
negative outcomes following a disruptive event, and lead to policy changes that prepare our health and social
systems for the rising prevalence of dementia."
10878864,"RP3 PROJECT SUMMARY
People with dementia (PWD) who live in the community often have multiple comorbid medical conditions,
resulting in extensive medication use. While medications can yield many benefits, they can also result in
substantial harms. Medications commonly prescribed to older adults can impair cognition, increase fall risk,
and cause other serious outcomes, often serve no discernible purpose, and are frequently inconsistent with
remaining life expectancy and goals of care. Such problems may be particularly common and damaging for
PWD given this population’s enhanced susceptibility to adverse drug effects, difficulty communicating drug-
related symptoms, and often limited life expectancy. Reducing use of medications that are unnecessary or
likely to cause more harm than good can thus play a critical role in improving quality of life for PWD. Yet,
efforts to achieve this are compromised by fundamental gaps in knowledge. While prior studies have
documented frequent use of selected inappropriate medications in community-dwelling PWD, much less is
known about use of other types of unnecessary and harmful medications such as unnecessarily aggressive
disease management, duplicative therapies, medications with no clear indication, and medications
inappropriate near the end of life, and little is known about which risk factors may drive use of problematic
therapies. In addition, efforts to reduce use of problematic medications in PWD are likely to be more successful
if they align with patient and caregiver attitudes and preferences toward medication use, yet much remains
unknown about this topic. We seek to resolve these knowledge gaps through a series of linked specific aims
that take advantage of high-value national data sources, including the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), and Medicare Parts A, B, and D. Using linked HRS and
Medicare data, we will evaluate a broad range of unnecessary and harmful medication use in community-
dwelling PWD, and assess which risk factors and clinical circumstances may lead to especially high use of
unnecessary and harmful medications. In addition, we will capitalize on unique data elements present in
NHATS to explore the attitudes of PWD and their caregivers toward medications and opportunities to reduce
medication use. Our aims are (1) To characterize the frequency and types of unnecessary and harmful
medication use in community-dwelling PWD, and to compare this to usage patterns in people without
dementia; (2) To evaluate risk factors for use of unnecessary and harmful medication use among community-
dwelling PWD, with a special focus on the role of hospitalization, and to determine whether these risk factors
are different than in people without dementia; and (3) Using validated survey questions from NHATS, to
characterize the attitudes of community-dwelling PWD and their caregivers toward their medications and their
willingness to stop medications. Information gained from this study will inform interventions to reduce
medication burdens and harms among the large and vulnerable population of community-dwelling PWD."
10878865,"RP4 PROJECT SUMMARY
 Growth in the prevalence of dementia will intensify the challenges of delivering appropriate care to persons
with dementia (PWD) and their family caregivers. Consistent with care preferences and evidence of cost
savings, long-term care is shifting away from institutional care facilities to the home setting. PWD are
increasingly living at home throughout the course of their illness, typically with multiple comorbid illnesses
requiring concurrent management. The increasing delivery of home-based clinical care holds promise for
supporting PWD and their family caregivers by allowing clinicians to address the complex social,
environmental, medical, and safety concerns that emerge for this population. This project will critically enhance
our understanding of the lives of persons with dementia by focusing on two key components of Medicare
home-based clinical care delivery: (1) home-based medical care provided by physicians, physician assistants
and nurse practitioners and (2) skilled home health care provided by professionals (e.g., nurses, physical
therapists) on an episodic basis for homebound individuals. Using two longitudinal cohorts, the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), linked to Medicare claims
and geospatial data, this project will document the utilization of home-based clinical services among PWD
living in the community (Specific Aim 1), evaluate disparities in receipt of home-based clinical services
(Specific Aim 2), and examine the consequences of these services (Specific Aim 3). Utilizing rich longitudinal
cohorts, administrative data, geospatial analysis, and rigorous methods, this project examines disparities in
home-based care delivery while considering key factors such as gender, function and coexisting illness
burden. We will also evaluate the consequences of use of these services for patients and families. Such
information will guide care delivery for this vulnerable population in the context of a growing shift towards
person-centered, home-based care. Our results will inform the evolution of home-based medical care and
skilled home health care policy. They will also instruct the larger context of home-based care delivery by
offering insights on what fosters high quality care for persons with dementia. The proposed analyses can serve
as a platform for future investigations examining best practices for serving PWD and their caregivers. Most
importantly, the knowledge generated by this proposed study is an important step in developing and expanding
services to support the growing numbers of PWD."
10878867,"RP5 PROJECT SUMMARY
 The locus of end-of-life care is shifting from hospitals and nursing homes to the community, intensifying
pressure to ensure the availability of high-quality end-of-life care at home. The proportion of U.S. decedents
dying at home has increased from 22 percent in 2000 to 31 percent in 2017 and for those dying of dementia it
has almost doubled in the same period. End-of-life care at home can be extremely challenging, particularly in
the context of dementia. Persons with dementia (PWD) residing at home have similar medical acuity to those
in nursing homes and experience high pain and symptom burden, difficulty communicating care preferences,
behavior challenges, preventable hospitalizations, and frequent transitions across healthcare settings.
 Hospice is the dominant model of home care for seriously ill individuals at the end of life. Hospices provide a
constellation of interdisciplinary care encompassing pain and symptom management, and psychosocial,
spiritual and caregiver support with the goal of enabling individuals to remain at home at the end of life. The
potential of hospice to improve the end-of-life experience for community-dwelling PWD and their families is
enormous. Yet our understanding of the impact of hospice use among those with dementia is almost
exclusively based in the nursing home setting. We lack a population-level understanding of the impact of
hospice on outcomes relevant to PWD who remain in the community at the end of life.
 We will address these knowledge gaps using two population-based studies, the National Health and Aging
Trends Study and the Health and Retirement Survey that contain rich demographic, socioeconomic, healthcare
utilization, and end-of-life care assessments of older adults. These datasets provide an unprecedented
opportunity to examine multiple facets of the end-of-life experience of a national sample of community-dwelling
PWD and how hospice impacts that experience. Further, the 20-year timespan of these data will enable us to
examine access to hospice for community-dwelling PWD over time and the impact of recent hospice policy
changes on hospice use. Our aims are: 1) Evaluate the impact of hospice on perceived quality of end-of-life
care (unmet needs for pain and symptom management, interactions with care teams, and goal concordant
care) for community-dwelling PWD; 2) Evaluate the impact of hospice on end-of-life healthcare utilization
(nursing home admission, hospitalization, care transitions, and home death); and 3) Characterize longitudinal
patterns of hospice use by community-dwelling PWD and quantify the impact of Medicare policy changes on
hospice use rates. Knowledge gained from this proposal will elucidate how hospice impacts outcomes relevant
to end-of-life dementia care in the community, identify potential barriers to its use and thus where additional or
alternative models of care may be needed, and inform policies to prepare our healthcare system for the rising
prevalence of end-of-life dementia care in our communities."

10877610,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Investigating the functional aspects of RNA structure is significant as it provides fundamental knowledge of RNA
biology and advances emergent technologies that seek to use, and target, RNA therapeutically. Major obstacles
to such efforts arise from our limited knowledge of the extent of functional RNA structure encoded within human
pathogenic viral genomes. This renewal seeks to advance upon our previous work that developed a
methodological pipeline for structured RNA discovery. This approach divides the discovery process into two
parts: a scanning step, where long sequences are decomposed into overlapping analysis windows from which
structure-related metrics are predicted and a folding step, where consensus structures across overlapping
windows are generated revealing the most sequence-ordered, thermodynamically stable structures (an
indication of an evolved property). Our approach has been very successful at identifying highly ordered and
functional structures across an array of human pathogens, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, where discovered motifs were
used to develop therapeutic leads. Our overarching hypothesis is that many regulatory RNA structures remain
to be found in the highly restricted space of viral genomes and that they can be uncovered using a holistic
research approach that combines computational and experimental methods. In this renewal, our goal is to make
improvements to our discovery pipeline to overcome its current limitations (most significantly to address higher
order RNA structure) and apply it to medically important viral genomes. The outcomes of this proposal will be:
(i) the generation of a robust methodological pipeline for functional RNA 2D and 3D structure discovery; (ii)
insight into novel regulatory features of pathogenic human viruses; and (iii) leads for future work to
therapeutically target RNA structure."
10885385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has a high rate of comorbidity with
cannabis use disorder (CUD). Indeed, in veterans diagnosed with CUD, PTSD is the most highly co-occurring
disease. Moreover, patients with comorbid PTSD and CUD have greater drug use severity and show poorer
treatment outcomes than patients diagnosed with either PTSD or CUD alone. Conversely, PTSD is often listed
as a medical condition potentially ameliorated by cannabis use. However, the clinical literature is mixed regarding
the effect of cannabis use on PTSD symptoms, with some earlier studies indicating cannabis use may self-
medicate PTSD and newer literature arguing that it exacerbates PTSD symptoms and reduces treatment
efficacy. Thus, the prevalence of PTSD/CUD comorbidity and the increasing legal status of cannabis in United
States make it imperative to understand the mechanisms whereby cannabis use is potentially promoting or
ameliorating PTSD symptoms. Using acute restraint stress combined with a rat cannabis self-administration
paradigm, I recently found that cannabis use promotes two primary PTSD-like symptoms, avoidance coping
behaviors (immobility in the defensive burying task) and the generalization of stress coping responses to a
neutral stimulus not previously associated with stress exposure. These clinically relevant discoveries are the
foundation for my K99/R00 Pathway to Independence proposal. This proposal aims to identify neurobiological
mechanisms underpinning how cannabis use changes and potentially exacerbates PTSD-like symptoms. During
the K99 portion, I will characterize, in a cell-specific manner, the neuroadaptations induced by the interaction
between stress and cannabis use in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). To this end, I will combine in vivo
zymography with confocal microscopy and digital rendering approaches to quantify changes in the tetrapartite
synaptic plasticity, which includes changes in: morphology of D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons (MSNs),
astroglia, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Aim 1). I will then use the in vivo single-cell Ca2+ recording from
D1- and D2-MSNs in NAcore, to determine which cell type and what patterns of activity are associated with the
exacerbating effects of cannabis use on stress responses (Aim 2). In the R00 portion, I will apply my K99 training
to study how stress and cannabis affect the tetrapartite synaptic plasticity in ventral pallidum (VP), a primary
accumbens output nucleus that translates rewarding and aversive stimuli into behavioral responses. I will assess
the signaling between ECM, astrocyte and GABAergic neurons (VPGABA), as well as the expression of
perineuronal nets (PNNs) following acute stress and cannabis use (Aim 3a). I will then evaluate the specific role
of PNNs in the altering effects of cannabis use on stress responses (Aim 3b). Finally, I will use changes in
intracellular Ca2+ to determine if exposure to stress-conditioned stimuli or neutral stimuli changes the activity of
VPGABA after cannabis use (Aim 4). By examining tetrapartite plasticity in a brain circuit known to strongly regulate
both reward and avoidance behaviors, I expect to identify new targets for regulating PTSD and CUD comorbidity."
10886943,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sebaceous carcinomas (SebCA) of the ocular adnexa (OA) most frequently arise from the specialized
sebaceous glands of the eyelid (Meibomian glands, MGs), and commonly exhibit local invasiveness with
intraepithelial spread into the conjunctiva. These aggressive features complicate complete surgical excision and
increase the risk for distant metastasis, resulting in a mortality rate of up to 40% of affected patients. While
alterations in TP53 and/or RB1 and syndromic loss-of-function mutations in mismatch repair genes have been
associated with OA SebCA, the genomic landscape of this tumor remains largely unresolved. I recently
demonstrated MYC overexpression in a subset of OA SebCA, both with and without amplification at the MYC
locus, and many of the high-MYC tumors also harbored mutations and copy number alterations in components
of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. The effects of dysregulated IIS on MYC
expression and malignant transformation of the MG remain unresolved, and MYC overexpression as driver of
OA SebCA has not been previously evaluated. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that MYC
overexpression in meibocytes is initiated through dysregulated IIS, resulting in enhanced proliferative potential
and cell survival in addition to local immunosuppression. I further predict that MYC overexpression, alone, is
insufficient for malignant transformation of meibocytes, requiring the acquisition of tumor suppressor mutation.
As such, the objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of IIS on MYC expression in meibocytes,
characterize the molecular and transcriptomic changes associated with IIS modulation in meibocytes,
understand the impact of both on cells in the local microenvironment, and define the temporal relationship
between MYC overexpression and TP53 loss-of-function with respect to malignant transformation of the MG in
vivo. To accomplish this, Aim 1 will assess the impact of pharmacologically and genetically modulated IIS on
cell behavior, transcriptional landscape, and MYC expression in normal and neoplastic meibocytes in vitro, while
Aim 2 will define the effects of modulated MYC expression on phenotypic features and the transcriptional
landscape of normal and neoplastic meibocytes in vitro. Additionally, the consequences of MYC overexpression,
in the presence or absence of Trp53 inactivation, on the MG and local microenvironment will be determined
using genetically engineered mouse models. The rich research environment afforded by Tufts University, the
Tufts Clinical Translational Science Institute, and associated partners ensures access to resources and expertise
necessary for completion of the proposed work. My training in veterinary pathology, vision science, and
molecular biology, along with guidance from my mentoring team with expertise in comparative immuno-oncology,
pathology, IIS, and MYC biology, will facilitate successful completion of milestones outlined in this application
and the transition to an independent clinician scientist in the field of comparative ocular pathology and oncology."
10887013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposed study is to examine the impact of retail policies on disparities in
tobacco outcomes and allow me to establish research independence as an early-stage
investigator. The tobacco retail environment greatly influences tobacco use disparities through
the presence of advertisements, promotions, and the availability of tobacco products.
Communities with predominantly lower socioeconomic and minority population groups have
more tobacco retail stores and higher tobacco prevalence, hence perpetuating tobacco use
disparities. To curb the effect of the retail environment on tobacco use, localities are actively
adopting policies that limit tobacco product availability. Some policies include restrictions on the
sale of flavored tobacco products (FTP) or tobacco retailer licensing (TRL) policies to reduce the
presence of tobacco retail stores. However, the impact of these policies on selected tobacco
outcomes or related disparities remains understudied and unclear. This policy evaluation study
will use advanced statistical methods to achieve three main goals: 1) describe and examine the
impact of local TRL laws and fees on sociodemographic differences in retailer density by area-
level race/ethnicity, income, and education; 2) explain and measure the impact of local FTP
restrictions on sociodemographic differences in product sales within the communities by area-
level race/ethnicity, income, and education; and 3) visualize and investigate the interactive
effect of both policies on sociodemographic differences in individual-level exclusive and dual
youth and adult cigarette and e-cigarette use. This K01 Mentored Career Development Award
will provide the necessary foundation for my career as a principal investigator, skilled in
analyzing tobacco policies with advanced analytic skills to understand their effect on tobacco
outcomes and health disparities within the communities. These study findings will help
policymakers and researchers understand the need to revise existing or adopt new retail
policies to address the tobacco use epidemic in their communities."

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a fatal form of congenital heart disease characterized by the
underdevelopment of left-sided structures, including the left ventricle (LV), mitral and aortic valves, and
ascending aorta. These three structural deficiencies result in diminished circulation that invariably leads to
morbidity without surgical intervention. It is currently thought that HLHS is an oligogenic disease of co-
occurring structural defects caused by different genetic lesions. In some cases, however, one structural defect
might be primary and the others secondary. As HLHS is clinically heterogeneous, there are likely multiple paths
to disease pathogenesis caused by diverse, and often unknown, genetic etiologies. To begin studying the
affected genes in the context of heart development, I mined published databases for de novo and rare
inherited variants in HLHS probands for follow-up in zebrafish. I initially selected RBFOX2, a highly conserved
RNA binding protein (RBP), based on its strong statistical link to HLHS and lack of study in cardiac
development. I published that rbfox2 mutant zebrafish display all three HLHS-like structural heart defects that
arise secondary to compromised pump function (Huang et al. Nat Commun 2022). However, unlike patients
that are heterozygous for RBFOX2, heterozygous zebrafish and mice are healthy. Therefore, no appropriate
model exists to investigate how halving the dose of RBFOX2 affects CM biology. Moreover, many variants
statistically linked to HLHS remain unvalidated or unstudied in whole animal models. To address these
knowledge gaps, I engineered and characterized RBFOX2 het and null human (h) iPSC-CMs. Both genetic
cohorts show dose-dependent reductions in cell size, cell adhesion, calcium handling, and oxygen
consumption rates. Myofibril alignment is also perturbed. Based on this phenotypic characterization and
integration of several sequencing datasets, I propose to test the hypothesis that RBFOX2 directly regulates CM
cell adhesion and growth by controlling transcript stability and splicing of an ECM-cytoskeletal-myofibril gene
network in Aim 1. To identify additional HLHS-linked variants that cause cardiac phenotypes in zebrafish, I
conducted a pilot CRISPR screen and recovered an ortholog of FOXC2, which encodes a transcription factor
expressed in the endocardium and myocardium. Preliminary phenotyping revealed HLHS-like cardiac
phenotypes in foxc2 global knock-outs that also fail to activate a Notch reporter in the endocardium. In Aim 2, I
propose to test the hypothesis that endocardial-specific FOXC2-deficiency leads to primary valve and
secondary myocardial defects caused by defective Notch signaling. Overall, I anticipate learning that both
myocardial- and endocardial-intrinsic defects recapitulate specific aspects of HLHS. More broadly, implicating
human variants as causal for HLHS pathogenesis and deciphering their mechanism of action in whole animal
and human iPSC models will ultimately lead to better predictors of heart failure following surgical intervention
and new therapeutic inroads for patient-specific clinical management of the disease."

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and affects about 13 out of 100
American men. The standard diagnosis approach for prostate cancer incorporates prostate specific-
antigen (PSA) blood test, digital rectal examination and biopsy, and, recently, the Prostate Imaging
Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) that localizes and stratifies the risk of lesions in biparametric
MRI (bpMRI) images. Detection of clinically significant cancer (csPCa) remains a challenge, resulting
in over- and underdiagnosis. Thus, accurate diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer will have a
significant impact on successful treatment planning and clinical management. As large-scale imaging
datasets become widely available in clinical settings, more prostate cancer studies are adopting
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, the common approach in the
existing studies has a drawback of using imaging findings, e.g., lesion size and radiomics features.
This project aims to implement and validate cutting-edge DL-based frameworks for the diagnosis and
prognosis of prostate cancer while fully utilizing imaging data and clinical scores (e.g., initial PSA
level and prostate genomic score). The proposed project will use state-of-the-art DL architectures
such as U-Net, image transformer and neural additive model to develop frameworks for robust DL-
based prostate and zonal anatomy segmentation (Aim 1), prediction of a csPCa probability map (Aim
2), and forecast of biochemical recurrence using interpretable multimodal DL framework (Aim 3). We
expect these frameworks will offer novel techniques adapted for prostate cancer, unique and
interpretable features from multimodal markers to better understand diagnosis and prognosis, and will
eventually help guide treatment selection and clinical management. This project will build on Dr. Kim's
quantitative background in modeling and analysis of neuroimaging data. During the project, Dr. Kim
will gain clinical expertise in prostate cancer via formal training driven by coursework (e.g., oncology
and biology) and research mentorship. Through the K25 award, Dr. Kim will lay the groundwork for
establishing an independent research program of computational methods for prostate cancer."
10889114,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are short (~20 bp) oligonucleotides that have chemically-modified
backbones to resist endonuclease activity in cells and biological fluids. ASOs bind to targeted mRNAs within
cells and act as catalysts for RNAse H to destroy the mRNA, thus decreasing gene expression. The most
common ASO modification is the substitution of the unbridging oxygen atom of the phosphodiester group with
a sulfur atom to create the phosphorothioate (PS) moiety which is most often used in clinical ASOs to date.
Further stabilization and nuclease resistance may be conferred through the modification of the 2’ position of
ribose of the ASO. It is widely known that the liver is the natural sink for PS-ASOs, however, the mechanism
for this activity is not clear. We have discovered that the Stabilin class (SR-H) scavenger receptors (Stabilin-1
and Stabilin-2) are the primary mechanism for systemic PS-ASO clearance. Stabilins are expressed in a
number of tissues including the sinusoids of liver, lymph nodes, spleen, Type II macrophages, bone marrow,
etc which may have implications for PS-ASO delivery to many tissues. The gap in knowledge is how
interactions of PS-ASOs with the Stabilins increases PS-ASO knock-down of targeted mRNAs. Our central
hypothesis is that Stabilin-mediated endocytosis of PS-ASO proceeds along 2 pathways; one in which the PS-
ASO is shuttled to the lysosome (destruction) and the other in which the PS-ASO is allowed to escape the
endosome to interact with mRNAs (efficacy). Our primary objectives for this project are first, to determine the
biological interactions of Stabilin-PS-ASO binding complexes with the use of biolayer interferometry with
competing ligands in both known solutions and in plasma. Second, to determine the kinetics of PS-ASO
endocytosis in both recombinant stable cells lines expressing the Stabilins and in primary sinusoidal
endothelial cells of liver. We will also dissect the endocytosis mechanisms of Stabilin-2 in which we will
elucidate interacting molecules that are necessary for PS-ASO activity (endosomal escape). Third, to
determine the systemic clearance and bioactivity of PS-ASOs in WT and Stabilin knock-out mice to assess
Stabilin-dependent biodistribution and activation in tissues other than just the liver. We will use global and
tissue-specific Stabilin knockout mice for these studies. This will further delineate the two possible pathways
(destruction vs activation) in multiple tissues and how the Stabilins contribute to each pathway. The expected
outcomes of this project will lend greater understanding for the structure-activity relationship, efficacy, and
overall metabolism of clinical-grade PS-ASOs and Stabilin biology/biochemistry."
10889191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The most common major surgical procedure in the United States is total knee arthroplasty. Periprosthetic joint
infection (PJI) is the most severe complication in total knee arthroplasty, and the largest reason for total knee
arthroplasty revision in approximately 25% of all revisions. The 5-year mortality for PJI is 20%, higher than most
cancers. Bacteriophage therapy is a promising therapy for chronic bacterial infections. Our group has completed
a series of phage therapies in recalcitrant chronic PJI cases under compassionate use guidelines with the FDA.
Based on its success, this is now an independently funded FDA Phase II/III study where enrollment has just
begun. These therapies utilize bacteriophages, viruses specific to bacteria, to bind and lyse the bacteria.
Preoperative bacterial cultures are obtained and screened against a large phage library to select a specific phage
matched to the clinical isolate. This method is similar to determining antibiotic sensitivity using CLSI protocols.
Matching a phage to an isolate is necessary as phages bind specific surface receptors that can have large
variations in the same bacterial species. In Staphylococcus aureus, the most common organism in PJI, phages
primarily bind to wall teichoic acid (WTA), a peptidoglycan receptor. WTA can have different glycosylation
dependent on the local environment and growth states of the bacteria. The objective of this proposal is to
determine how changes in WTA glycosylation vary under different environmental conditions and their resulting
impact on phage activity. This will contribute to our long-term goal to develop new treatment strategies for PJI.
The rationale for this work is that an improved understanding of changes in WTA glycosylation will allow accurate
phage selection to consequently create effective reproducible protocols to inform future clinical studies and
therapy."

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). EC levels have been correlated with obesity in
knockout mice for liver (L) FABP that is co-expressed with intestinal (I) FABP in enterocytes and also for
PPARa knockouts, underscoring the regulatory roles of these proteins. We will probe poorly understood
EC-FABP, EC-PPAR, and FABP-EC-PPAR complexes in vitro at near-physiological concentrations,
determining affinities, metabolic fates, molecular binding interfaces, and conformational changes to test
mechanistic hypotheses regarding EC signaling. Trainees at multiple career stages, including those
recruited from underrepresented groups in STEM, will be integrally involved in this research program.
 Specific questions to be addressed are as follows: (1) How do ECs choose between FABP
chaperones to produce obese or lean outcomes? The possibility that ECs are delivered by LFABP to
hydrolytic enzymes for metabolic breakdown rather than sequestered by IFABP in the enterocyte will be
tested enzymatically, whereas the rationale for LFABP’s diminished affinity will be explored using high-
pressure solution-state NMR to identify energetically favored candidate sites for binding. (2) Could
transcriptional activity be driven by EC binding preferences for LFABP vs. PPARa? The PPARa
ligand-binding domain (PPARa_LBD) will be purified, rigorously delipidated, and tested in vitro for EC-
modulated transcriptional activity. EC binding affinities will be compared for PPARa_LBD and FABPs.
(3) Could transcriptional activity be driven by EC-modulated FABP-PPAR collisions that cause
conformational changes? To determine the interactions involved in the proposed FABP-mediated EC
activation of PPARa transcriptional function, we will first use surface plasmon resonance to measure the
binding affinity of LFABP-PPARa_LBD protein complexes, on their own and in the presence of ligands
with a range of known activation efficacies. The site-specific collision-associated impact on the LFABP
partner will be probed by solution-state NMR spectroscopy of the [U-15N]-enriched protein, using chemical
shift perturbations of each backbone NH resonance to define the binding interface with PPARa_LBD, any
allosteric structural changes that occur upon complex formation, and their modulation by EC ligands. Taken
together, these experiments will advance our understanding of (macro)molecular networks that function to
achieve metabolic signaling by ECs involved in appetite and pain regulation, thereby advancing our
understanding of health risks related to obesity and inflammation. This understanding can guide the design
of drugs that modulate these biomedically important ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of the bone marrow. There is a well-documented
survival disparity with non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients having a better outcome compared to non-Hispanic
black (NHB) patients. To date, clinical trials with minimal NHB patient participation are the basis for all
approved treatments and risk stratification systems. How ancestral racial backgrounds are reflected in AML
that arises in NHB patients is largely unknown. This may have led to treatment practices that are not optimal
for NHB patients. Indeed, in contrast to NHWs who have a good prognosis, NHB patients with NPM1 mutations
have an adverse prognosis when treated with standard therapies. The lack of preclinical models of NHB origins
further exacerbate this lack of knowledge. As a result, there is little to no preclinical or clinical evidence to what
extent the current approved therapies in AML are efficacious in NHB patients. This is clearly unacceptable.
This proposal seeks to leverage novel approaches to generate preclinical AML models of NHB origins and to
compare therapy responses and basic biochemical properties to models generated from NHW patients. This
will be accomplished in the 3 aims of this proposal. They are 1) Utilize the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon
system to generate AML models from CD34+ cells derived from healthy donors of NHB and NHW origins; 2)
Characterize racial differences in therapy sensitivity and DNA damage response in AML models; 3) Develop
patient derived organoid models from NHW and NHB AML patients; The results from this study will greatly
inform the influence of racial ancestry on AML arising from NHB patients. This information will guide new
strategies geared specifically towards AML in NHB patients and will inform drug development efforts to ensure
future therapies are efficacious for AML patients of all racial backgrounds."
10889696,"Over the next five years, more than 2-3 million patients will fail to respond to anti-VEGF therapy or display only
partial therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, anti-VEGF itself can cause healthcare problems in patients. Therefore,
there is a critical need to identify alternative anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory targets and selective
therapeutics to supplement or replace current treatment strategies. Dysregulated vasculogenesis and vascular
homeostasis are central drivers of retinal diseases, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic
retinopathy (DR). An understudied pathological atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway
is one such alternative pathway. Our recent studies elucidated the molecular regulation of atypical inflammatory
responses in vascular cells. Furthermore, preliminary studies demonstrate that a genetic mutation blocking
atypical p38 protects the retina from vaso-obliteration and neovascular tufting in an oxygen-induced retinopathy
(OIR) model. Despite strong evidence supporting the central role of p38 in many retinal diseases, prior promising
broad-range p38 therapeutics have failed due to the inhibition of all physiological and pathological signaling.
Conversely, atypical p38 utilizes an independent pathway activated only in response to disease signaling,
representing an alternative therapeutic target. This project overcomes current limitations by developing models
to investigate and selectively target atypical p38 signaling.
 Our central hypothesis is that atypical p38 activation plays a central role in propagating vascular inflammatory
and angiogenic responses in retinal disease. We will explore two specific aims to test this hypothesis: Aim 1:
Defining Atypical p38-Dependent Regulation of Retinal Proangiogenic, Proinflammatory Signaling, and
Neovascularization. Using our OIR model, we will further define protection from pathological neovascular
responses in an atypical p38 deficient C57BL/6 mouse. These data will be confirmed in a retinal explant model
and 3D sprouting spheroids of human retinal cells, and an established cell-penetrating peptide inhibitor. Using
cytokine arrays, RNAseq, and high-resolution microscopy, we will examine the role of atypical p38 in retinal
neovascularization. Aim 2: Characterization of Intrabodies to Block Atypical Signaling in Retinal Vascular Cells.
We have developed an array of inhibitory nanobodies (IBi) to selectively block atypical p38 signaling. We will
characterize the capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV1) dependent delivery of intrabodies to suppress
atypical p38 signaling inflammation and neovascular responses in primary human retinal endothelial cells.
Additionally assessing AAV1-IBi retinal expression and suppression of OIR. Upon completion of the proposed
studies, we expect to have 1) evidence that Tab1-intrabody expression inflammation and angiogenesis in retinal
endothelial cells, and 2) a model of atypical p38-enhanced retinal damage during OIR. Critically, AAV-delivered
intrabodies are the first generation of atypical p38 inhibitors that can be developed as either a complementary
or alternative anti-VEGF strategy to treat vascular retinopathies."

Because of the increase in life expectancy, a larger fraction of the population is now elderly and afflicted by age-
related diseases with a huge cost for the health care system. Understanding the process of aging is thus
imperative to help with the identification of strategies for healthier and more graceful aging. Exciting new studies
in the pioneering organism C. elegans show that glia, a previously unsuspected cell type, communicate long
distance to other cells to control stress response and aging. Furthermore, gene expression analysis in mice and
humans show that glial genes undergo larger changes in expression, as compared to neuronal genes, during
aging. Taken together, these data support the idea that glia may govern aging across species. However, the
understanding of the function of glia in aging is in its infancy. Our lab has dedicated the past 17 years to the
study of glia in C. elegans and thus is perfectly positioned to significantly contribute to this exciting new area of
research. In our studies, we have identified the Cl-/HCO3- permeable channel clh-1 as a major contributor of ionic
homeostasis in the worm nervous system. We have published that clh-1, by controlling Cl- and HCO3-, regulates
pH and GABA signaling in the nervous system. We have now unexpectedly discovered that knockout of clh-1
extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Our preliminary data support that the stress response
transcription factor daf-16/FOXO is needed for clh-1 mediated changes in lifespan. In this exploratory application,
we will leverage the power of C. elegans genetics and the imaging and solutes supplementation methods we
have developed in the last 17 years to begin deciphering how the glial ion channel clh-1 controls organismal
aging. Our specific aims are: 1. To establish what function of glial clh-1 influences aging, and 2. To identify
tissues and pathways regulated by glial clh-1 in aging. This work will lay the foundation for future studies on the
role of glial clh-1 and glia in general in aging and stress response. Ultimately, our work will advance our
understanding of the role of glia in organismal aging, potentially suggest novel targets for the treatment of age-
related disease, and even help identify strategies to improve our quality of life in old age."

One bottleneck to achieving therapeutically relevant cell concentrations at the infarct site after myocardial
infarction is the poor cell engraftment and retention of vehicles at the target site. Here we propose the first-of-its-
kind, tunable, replenishable scaffold of cells that allows for multiple drug delivery ""waves"" to address this gap.
We hypothesize that cardioregenerative cell accumulation and retention in the infarcted myocardium will be
enhanced by surface decorating them with proteins that cross-link the cells via layer-by-layer assembly into a
scaffold. Unlike conventional delivery strategies, which do not allow the subsequent accumulation of cells or
carriers after saturation of the target infarct, each dose of cells in our platform will serve as a capturing surface
for the next dose of cells. This will dramatically amplify the targetable surface area for additional waves of cell
attachment and will also allow the total therapeutic concentration to be adjusted based on the number of doses
administered. To prevent premature cross-linking, we will use engineered proteins that form heterodimers but
not homodimers. These studies are expected to result in a new class of carrier-linked network that will not only
substantially enhance cellular accumulation, retention, and local drug release at the infarct site to maximize
therapeutic efficacy but also allow for several cycles of drug replenishment or personalized dosing in a non-
invasive manner. Here, we aim to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effectiveness of this approach and assess
the effect of surface modification on stem cell function. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
transform the treatment of patients suffering from myocardial infarction."

 Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell-
type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives
such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using
criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main
challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the
3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced
chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks
during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D
enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from
healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer
network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to
earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and
their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell
specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative
enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers
identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary
human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D
genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful
completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers
that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their
mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For
instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified
in genome-wide association studies."

Elevated risk taking contributes not only to the development of substance use disorder (SUD) but also the
likelihood of relapse. There has been significant progress in delineating the neural substrates underlying this
causal relationship. Nonetheless, we are still faced with a significant barrier in translating these findings to the
clinical setting because the majority of the work on this topic has used male subjects. This is despite the well-
established sex differences in risk taking and aspects of SUD. This significant limitation in scientific
advancement can be remediated by examining neurobiological mechanisms underlying decision making in
females. The long-term goal of our lab is to identify the neural mechanisms mediating risk taking in females
and how hormones contribute to these processes. To meet this goal, I will use a rodent model of risk taking in
which females are more risk averse and exhibit greater sensitivity to risk of punishment than males. In this model,
female risk aversion is largely mediated by estradiol (E2) and such E2-dependent risk aversion requires estrogen
receptor (ER) β. We have also established a role for the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and its projections to the
nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in promoting risk averse behavior. Preliminary data reveal that activation of D2
dopamine receptors (D2Rs) in the BLA increases risk aversion in females, but not males. These findings suggest
that differences in BLA function may underlie sex differences in risk taking, and specifically, promote risk aversion
in females. Prior work shows sex differences in BLA-dependent behavior are due to the ability of E2 to modulate
BLA activity and function. Given the role of the BLA in risk taking and the fact it is potently modulated by E2, it is
therefore conceivable that risk aversion in females may be due to E2 regulation of BLA activity necessary for
risk-based decision making. Consequently, the overall objective of this proposal is to dissect the neural
mechanisms by which E2 promotes risk aversion in females. I hypothesize that E2 mediates female risk aversion
through its modulation of ERβ and D2R function in the BLA and its projections to the NAc shell. I will test my
hypothesis by carrying out three experimental aims. In Aim 1, I will identify the contributions of ERs in the BLA
to E2-dependent risk aversion in females using RNA interference-mediated ER gene reduction. In Aim 2, I will
identify the necessity of E2 modulation of D2R function in the BLA for risk aversion in females using optogenetic
manipulation of BLA neurons that selectively express D2Rs. In Aim 3, I will identify the contribution of E2
modulation of BLA projections to the NAc shell to risk aversion in females using optogenetic manipulation of this
circuit. This project is significant because the knowledge gained will advance our understanding of the neural
mechanisms by which E2 mediates female risk aversion and provide a foundation from which we can determine
whether a disruption in these processes contributes to elevated risk taking associated with SUDs."

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has become an extended public health challenge due to the
emergence of variants that results in reduced protection by vaccination and prior infection. As innate immune
cells that recognize and lyse infected or stressed cells, natural killer (NK) cells are uniquely poised to respond
to SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping antigen-specific immune responses. NK cells can potently target
virus-infected cells via antibody-dependent responses even if the host antibodies have poor neutralizing
activity. While the ability of NK cells to mediate antibody-dependent responses could significantly influence
disease pathogenesis, the factors affecting NK cells’ antibody-dependent responses are understudied. My
proposed research seeks to resolve these critical gaps in our knowledge of the immune response to
SARS-CoV-2. I hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressant treatment, and acquisition of
surface molecules from infected cells impair the antibody-dependent responses of NK cells. To test this
hypothesis, I will 1) identify how COVID-19 vaccination and infection influence the ability of memory-like NK
cells to perform antibody-dependent responses; 2) elucidate how immunosuppressant drugs interact with
COVID-19 cytokines to affect NK cells’ antibody-dependent responses; and 3) define mechanisms by which
trogocytosis, the acquisition of surface molecules, from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells impairs NK cells’
antibody-dependent responses. In Aim 1, I will compare NK cells’ antibody-dependent responses across
different COVID-19 patient groups and build upon my training in immune cells’ surface proteomics analysis to
evaluate intracellular signaling activity. In Aim 2, I will co-culture NK cells with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to
elucidate the impact of immunosuppressant drugs on NK cells’ antibody-dependent response. In Aim 3, I will
gain training in dissecting NK cells’ ligand interactions and NK cell engineering to define mechanisms by which
trogocytosis can impair NK cells’ functions. My BSL3 certification and training to work with SARS-CoV-2,
combined with my experiences in evaluating NK cells’ functions, uniquely qualify me to carry out this proposed
research. This research plan will provide me with robust training in assessing NK cell responses to
virus-infected cells through the establishment of co-culture systems. Notably, my proposed research on
trogocytosis is a particularly novel research area and gives me the opportunity to creatively pursue an
understudied topic of interest by identifying the tools appropriate for this research. This work will be the first to
determine the mechanisms by which NK cells’ antibody-dependent responses are regulated in infection, with
therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases."

Chromatin structure and transcription regulation are essential for cellular function, and their dynamics are highly
correlated both in development and in disease. However, despite decades of amazing work identifying the
molecular players involved in these processes, and mapping their interactions genome-wide, we are currently
unable to describe the function connecting 3D chromatin structure and transcription dynamics. This limitation
stems from the fact that chromatin structure and gene expression emerge from intrinsically stochastic transitions
at the single-cell level, and we are missing the critical temporal parameters associated with these transitions.
Therefore, new tools to measure both chromatin structure and transcription over time in single cells are critical
for understanding how the human genome is read and for predictively controlling the epigenome.
 Here, we propose to develop a new set of live single-cell imaging technologies to simultaneously measure
changes in 3D chromatin structures and their associated dynamics of gene expression across a large range of
timescales: from dynamics of individual topologically associated domains and enhancer-promoter interactions,
to changes associated with stable epigenetic memory across cell cycles. For the shorter timescales (under a cell
cycle), our new imaging approach combines live super-resolution microscopy of fluorescently labeled loci with
end-point demultiplexing of loci identity using Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA), in order
to track and trace 3-12 points within a functional chromatin unit. This new technique, which we call live-ORCA,
will allow us to measure for the first time the temporal dynamics of an entire topologically associated domain in
single cells. We will use live-ORCA in conjunction with time-lapse imaging of transcriptional bursting to study
the dynamics of promoter-enhancer activity throughout cell differentiation and under perturbations of the
chromatin network. For the longer timescale (across multiple cell cycles), our approach will combine time-lapse
microscopy of gene expression, monitoring the distance between two tagged genomic loci as a live reporter of
chromatin structure, and end-point chromatin tracing of the entire gene neighborhood using ORCA. We will
perform these measurements in two systems: at a highly controlled synthetic reporter where we can induce
either short-term silencing or long-term epigenetic memory, and at time points in differentiation when genes
commit epigenetically to a new transcriptional state. Moreover, in order to further investigate the mechanism of
epigenetic inheritance, we will develop a novel microfluidic device that allows us to track changes in chromatin
3D structures across individual cell lineages. Finally, to test our quantitative understanding, we will go back and
forth between these single-cell data and theoretical modelling of chromatin dynamics. This research plan will
greatly advance our understanding of chromatin dynamics and its functional role in transcription regulation, while
at the same time contributing a whole new set of novel imaging technologies and engineered cell lines that will
serve as a jumping board for the 4D Nucleome and broader scientific community."
10902001,"This proposal will establish a training program called “Cancer Research Education, Advancement, Training
and Empowerment” (CREATE) at the University of Hawai`i Cancer Center (UHCC). The program addresses
the over-arching goal to enhance the training of a workforce to meet biomedical, behavioral, and clinical
research needs to lower cancer incidence and mortality in the Pacific. CREATE takes advantage of the
excellent research opportunities arising from the distinctive population and environment in Hawai`i and the
Pacific with strong multi-disciplinary collaborations at the University of Hawai`i and its collaborations with the
University of Guam. Research training in our multiethnic population with persons of Native Hawaiian, Pacific
Islander, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, and European ancestry is important to address cancer health
disparities due to ethnicity and low socio-economic status while the unique biologic resources and natural
compounds found nowhere else in the world will prepare the next generation of researchers for drug
discovery and mechanistic cancer research to create new cancer treatments. Besides the 10-week hands-on
experience at UHCC, CREATE will include a curriculum of multi-disciplinary seminars, workshops, and career
development sessions. Success of the program will be evaluated through several indicators, e.g., proportion
of participants in biomedical graduate programs and research careers, based on long-term tracking by
surveys, email, social media, and personal contacts. The goal of CREATE to offer distinctive training
experiences in cancer biology and in population sciences will be achieved through the implementation of the
following aims:
 1. Provide hands-on summer research experiences and a multi-disciplinary curriculum to
 undergraduate students residing in the Islands of Hawai`i and the Pacific to reinforce their intent to
 graduate with a science degree and to consider a career to address health disparities and
 contribute to drug discovery.
 2. Offer first-year graduate students living in Hawai`i and the Pacific in cancer-related fields of study
 the opportunity to gain a 1-semester research experience in a multiethnic environment or unique
 cancer biology labs with the goal to enhance their skills to address causes, diagnosis,
 prevention, and treatment of cancer and to improve competitiveness in their future careers in
 cancer-related research.
The program builds upon the many years of success of UHCC's Summer Internship Program that has
provided research experiences to more than 220 students over the last 10 years and was previously funded
by a CURE supplement to the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant and by philanthropic funds. The large pool
of potential participants will represent the distinct ethnic composition of students from Hawai`i and Guam. In
summary, CREATE will offer students in Hawai`i and the Pacific a unique research experience in population
sciences or cancer biology that will enable them to pursue successful careers in cancer prevention and
control."
10892797,"Project Summary
 Chiral, nonracemic molecules are highly important in the areas of organic synthesis, material
science and chemical biology. They are also of great value to agrochemical and pharmaceutical
industries because the three-dimensional structures of chiral molecules allow for the access to
broader chemical space in drug discovery. Therefore, the development of catalytic methods that
enable the generation of chiral molecules with high enantiopurity is important not only to academic
research, but also to pharmaceutical industries, and to human health.
 Organoboron compounds are useful building blocks in organic synthesis. The boryl group is
amenable to a variety of stereospecific chemical transformations. More importantly, the vacant p-
orbital of the boron atom can stabilize an anion or a radical in the neighboring carbon atom. This
unique property has facilitated the emergence of many innovative catalytic processes to generate
enantioenriched organoboronates. In this regards, our group has established a research program
centered on asymmetric synthesis using organoboron compounds. We particularly aim to address
the challenges in enantioselective synthesis of chiral molecules that are difficult to access by
conventional methods. In this proposal, we seek to develop catalytic asymmetric transformations
using organoboron compounds by exploiting the novel reactivities of α-boryl metal complexes and
α-boryl radicals. Through our continued collaboration with experts in computational chemistry, we
will further our understanding of the reaction mechanisms, which will guide us in the direction of
transformative reaction design. Meanwhile, the studies will allow for the access to enantioenriched
molecules that are valuable for organic synthesis and relevant to drug discovery."
10892798,"ABSTRACT
 My laboratory has been dedicated to developing physiologically relevant yet easy-to-apply tissue
modeling technologies, and exploring the interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM)
microstructures and cell metabolisms. Building on recent successes and discoveries, we propose to
develop a more advanced technology for liver modeling, and to profoundly study how fibrosis-relevant
ECM microstructures can impair hepatic metabolism—the former aims to reduce the monetary/time costs
and human subject risks in new drug development, and the latter will provide new understanding and
metabolic targets for fibrosis treatments. Although various microfluidic liver models have been reported,
they lack the critical compositions of the physiological liver, namely, all the necessary cell types, the
relevant architecture, and physiological 3D ECMs. Both literature and our preliminary results suggest the
crucial roles of these components in maintaining hepatic functions and homeostasis, which may explain
why current liver models could only mimic part of the functions. Integrating the various cell types, the
cellular architecture, and the 3D ECMs represents challenging hurdles by the available technologies.
Therefore, we propose an innovative technology to model the liver with a new fabrication logic, workflow,
and set of technical means. This technology will recapitulate the most liver niche properties heretofore,
but with relatively simple and straightforward operations (setting up, maintenance, analyses, etc.). We
recently reported for the first time that ECM microstructures could modulate metabolic activities in
various cell types. Based on this, we propose to set up ECM controls that mimic healthy and fibrotic
conditions, and thoroughly investigate how the aberrantly remodeled ECMs can impair hepatic
metabolisms. Mechanistic studies involving integrins and AMP-activated protein kinase are also planned.
To summarize, there has not been a tissue modeling technology like the proposed one; and others have
not reported the interactions between ECM microstructures and cell metabolism. The proposed work,
therefore, represents high novelty and my laboratory’s unique space in the field. Completing the proposed
studies will be significant for pharmaceutical developments because a new testing/screening platform
and metabolic (metabolites and the controlling proteins) targets will be provided for future fibrosis
therapies."

 Project Summary
 The Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) was established as a National Cancer Institute
basic science cancer center in 1978. As an NCI basic science cancer center, the PCCR's mission focuses on
basic discovery - discovery through Foundational Disciplines that the PCCR fosters for innovative cancer
solutions. The PCCR has embraced key opportunities for enhancing the impact of its administrative unit and has
laid a new foundation for improving the elements that facilitate cancer research at Purdue University. During the
last project period, administration milestones attained include: (1) facilitating and coordinating the planning and
establishment of a new strategic plan; (2) implementing new information technologies for improved data
management; and (3) successfully managing the core functions of the Cancer Center Support Grant. In order to
meet and exceed the growing needs of the PCCR membership, the PCCR Administrative Core has the following
specific aims: (1) execute administrative operations that include providing oversight and management of shared
resources, managing the membership processes, coordinating the processes and monitoring for pilot projects,
managing PCCR-controlled spaces, arranging and documenting Center meetings, monitoring Center finances,
and overseeing activities relevant to the CCSG grant application process; and (2) enhance informatics for more

10875641,"Biological Evaluation Shared Resource (BE-SR)
 Project Summary
 The discovery of new drug moieties to combat cancer is of paramount importance in overcoming this
destructive family of diseases. In order to facilitate entry of new drugs into clinical trials, biological targets must
be identified and validated, preliminary pharmacokinetics must be assessed, and initial toxicity/safety
characteristics must be determined. Furthermore, new compounds must demonstrate sufficient efficacy in
eliminating established tumors in animal models. In cancer biology, mouse models continue to play significant
roles in studying tumor invasion, metastasis, and malignant transformation, as well as in examining responses
to therapy. Towards this end, the use of mice for this testing is a cost-effective approach in early-stage
evaluations, especially in a basic science research environment. Key advancements have emerged in the
development of animal models for cancer biology, including the advent of orthotopic models for metastasis,
transgenic animals that have developmental pathways to tumorigenesis, and state-of-the-art
immunocompromised strains. In addition, transplanted human xenografts continue to serve as primary tools for
molecular discovery and evaluation. Despite their flaws and shortcomings, xenograft mouse models have played
a significant role in cancer drug development over the past three decades, and mouse models will continue to
be a foundation in the war against cancer. At the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR), where
a vast pipeline of potential new agents for diagnosing and treating cancer are emerging, researchers need a
productive and established facility for in vivo testing in murine cancer models. The mission of the Biological
Evaluation Shared Resource (BE-SR) is to provide expert guidance to PCCR investigators in preparing grant
proposals selecting animal models, designing animal studies, and performing toxicity testing and proof-of-
concept efficacy studies to advance investigator's projects using in vivo testing. In keeping with the BE-SR's
desire to offer the latest technologies in platform testing, the BE-SR has transitioned to using The Jackson
Laboratory's highly immunocompromised NRG mice for xenograft studies with cell lines, and to using patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) testing in this strain. These new services are just an example of the BE-SR's
commitment to adopting new technologies and approaches into the PCCR in order to better serve the evolving
needs of its researchers."
10875644,"Cell Identity and Signaling (CIS) Research Program
 Project Summary
 The key scientific goals of the Cell Identity and Signaling (CIS) Research Program are to advance discovery
of novel molecular mechanisms of cell identity and cell signaling, to apply this knowledge towards understanding
cancer pathogenesis, and to use this knowledge to develop novel, mechanism-based approaches to prevent or
interfere with cancer cell growth, aiming for cancer solutions. It is well-established that cancer cells hijack normal
regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and embryonic development, via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.
The CIS Program aims to understand these fundamental mechanisms and shepherd them toward cancer
solutions.
 The CIS Program has 27 members, $5.5 million in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed extramural funding, with
38% of the total funding from the NCI. CIS research themes span a spectrum from basic discovery, using simple
model organisms and cellular and animal cancer models, to cancer solutions. CIS members are highly productive
with 202 cancer-related publications since July 2015, and highly interactive with a 70% increase in collaborative
publications. Importantly, 73% of all cancer-relevant CIS publications are collaborative. In the previous funding
cycle, the CIS Program, supported by competitive pilot grants from the Purdue Center for Cancer Research
(PCCR), successfully fostered highly collaborative, cancer-relevant studies linking CIS Program themes (intra-
programmatic) with other PCCR programs (inter-programmatic), and also with external partners (inter-
institutional).
 For the next funding period, the goal of the CIS Program is to advance the breadth and depth of our
understanding of cancer-relevant mechanisms and to maximize their transition to cancer solutions. The approach
towards this goal is to enable and foster collaborative and transdisciplinary studies by providing competitive
PCCR pilot grants, and access to state-of-the-art, PCCR-supported Shared Resources, and modern technology
in structural biology, drug discovery, cancer genomics, bioinformatics and computational biology. Three specific
aims are proposed. Aim 1: To further enhance discovery of basic and cancer-relevant mechanisms by
strengthening the integration of computational genomics and bioinformatics and increasing expertise and training
in computational biology. Aim 2: To enhance discovery of cancer-relevant mechanisms of signal transduction,
gene expression and epigenetics by supporting collaborative, transdisciplinary approaches and modern
technologies. Aim 3: To accelerate transition of newly discovered cancer-relevant mechanisms towards cancer
solutions, by developing essential mechanisms as therapy targets, and by employing transdisciplinary
approaches."

(PCCR) Foundational Disciplines into collaborative studies that are launched from DDMS-associated expertise,
including molecular conjugates and nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, new imaging modalities for surgical
guidance and drug sensitivity, and new in vitro tumor models to study cancer biology. To accomplish future goals,
the DDMS Program will pursue three scientific themes that are embodied in its specific aims.
 Aim 1: Next generation therapeutic delivery systems to precisely administer anti-cancer agents
 Aim 2: Ultra-precision sensing and imaging techniques and devices for early detection and prognosis
 Aim 3: Innovative enabling technologies for research across the cancer spectrum
 The program is comprised of 31 faculty members from 13 Purdue University academic departments.
Members of the DDMS Program synergistically collaborate with other PCCR Research Programs, as
demonstrated by strong inter-programmatic publications (20%). DDMS is highly productive, having generated
370 cancer-relevant publications between July 2015 and July 2019. Among these publications, 58% represent
collaborative work. DDMS efforts are sustained by $4.6 million (direct) in peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant funding
in the last budget year. In addition, 86 patents and five start-up companies were created. To facilitate this highly
multidisciplinary Research Program, the Program Leaders (Drs. Bumsoo Han and Yoon Yeo) have been working
on promoting collaborative research and integrating biological sciences and engineering disciplines.
 Notable outcomes of investigations during the current funding period are new nanoparticle formulations
targeting both cancer and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, ligand-targeted imaging and
therapeutic agents, a new intraoperative image-guidance technique based on spectroscopy, and a new imaging
modality to assess the chemosensitivity of tumor tissues. In addition, new in vitro tumor models have been
developed to identify and validate new drug targets for pancreatic cancer and to perform research on drug
resistance and tumor onset for breast cancer.
 During the next funding period, DDMS leadership will pursue four initiatives: (1) continued excellence in drug
delivery and molecular sensing; (2) accelerated validation of sensing and imaging technologies with preclinical
models; (3) building on computational and data science expertise for cancer biology and drug discovery; and (4)
development of greater strength in physical science/engineering for oncology."
10875657,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE A
CEDA requires a solid administrative infrastructure for the research projects developed and supported through
the Center. The Administrative Core A consists of two subcores, A1 and A2, where A1 is primarily
administrative and manages the activities of the Center while A2 provides assistance and services related to
data and computing. Sub-Core A1 provides pre- and post-award grant support to CEDA affiliates. It also
manages the many activities of the Center designed to create networks, and introduce new ideas, through
meetings (conferences, workshops, seminars), visiting speakers, space, staff, visiting scholars, and
postdoctoral fellows who come with their own funds. Core A also is the primary point of contact and
management, such that it reports on the activities of the Center to NIA and UC Berkeley constituents; allocates
Center resources (pilot project funding through Core B, conference funding through Core C, allocates
resources to Core D and administers it, access to Core A2 programming and data services. Computing and
Data Sub-core A2 exists to ensure that researchers have adequate resources, and provides the following
functions by focusing on the computing facilities of the Demography Lab. Sub-Core A2 facilitates access to
data sets useful for Center research projects (including pilot projects) in user-friendly ways; provides
assistance in accessing and analyzing these data; recruits and trains GSRs for individual research projects
and pilot projects as requested; provides occasional training seminars on particular data sets such as HRS or
on general skills such as use of SAS, STATA, and R for interested Center affiliates, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and other interested faculty researchers not affiliated with the Center; provides assistance
locating, setting up, and learning to use relevant specialized software; provide all these services for graduate
students working on aging-related topics, including dissertation assistance. The Sub-core A2 coordinates
purchases of hardware for the Center; maintains contact with the Demography computing facility, D-lab, (a
consortium for supporting advanced data structures, forms and analysis which now includes UC DATA) to
avoid duplication of efforts and to assure smooth and comprehensive provision of services. In addition,
Subcore A2 supports applications required for data science, data security and confidentiality, and advanced
Bayesian modeling."
10875658,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE B
Of critical importance to CEDA is the development of innovative research directions by affiliates with potentially
high scientific payoff; to assist and encourage researchers not currently engaged in research on aging to
become engaged; and to encourage and facilitate the entry of new young researchers into the field. Meeting
these three goals should also contribute to a fourth – to generate R01, R03, R21, and other proposals to NIA
and other federal agencies. Core B, which funds pilot research projects, is the main instrument by which these
goals may be achieved, and it is therefore extremely important to the success of the Center. The pilots
proposed at this stage all have the potential to greatly extend research models regarding critical demographic
processes, and each represents at least one of the four research themes, and include researchers at different
career stages. One pilot is in the theme of Mortality Measurement: “Social network methods for estimating
adult death rates in the absence of vital registration.” Two pilots in the theme of Policy and Behavioral
Determinants of Adult Health: “A Pilot Trial of Gamification for Enhancing a Smoking Cessation App,” which
combines technology with behavioral economics; and “How Excess Sugar Consumption Early in Life Affects
Health in Adulthood,” which seeks to address early life behavior and adult health. The fourth pilot, in the theme
of Biodemography of Aging, is “Recording Lifetime Activity, sleep patterns and reproduction to assess health
span and predict time-to-death in the Mediterranean fruit fly.” The fifth pilot is in the theme of Macro
Consequences of Global Aging: “Population Aging and the Demand for Paid and Unpaid Care: the US in
International Context, an examination of caregiving in an aging society.” The pilot projects from Core B will
draw on the administrative, programming and data access resources of Core A, and in some cases on Core D
for placement of data or software on the web. These five represent the first of many pilot projects to be
developed and funded through CEDA. Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals with the help of a short
and simple proposal mechanism, with fast decision and feedback and advice during the process. Core A will
work with Core B to encourage and support CEDA affiliates who are already engaged in aging related research
to develop innovative lines of research with high potential payoffs, and also to encourage and support CEDA
affiliates who are not currently working on aging related projects to initiate work on aging. Of particular
importance is to continue our work in supporting new researchers, particularly junior faculty, into aging
research, and foster their development."
10892703,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In children with congenital heart disease (CHD) there is an unidentified biological switch that drives a biologic
transformation towards self-sustaining and progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In advanced
disease, PAH secondary to CHD shares biologic similarities with other PAH groups. However, the signaling and
metabolic derangements that drive early pulmonary vascular disease remain obscure, and currently available
therapies largely fail to address the underlying pathologic origins of disease. My long-term research objective is
to define the biochemical mechanisms by which aberrant pulmonary vascular hemodynamics initiate and drive
pulmonary vascular dysfunction in CHD. The specific purpose of this application is to describe early metabolic
and mechanotransductive signaling derangements in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle exposed to pulmonary
overcirculation, and define their contributions to an abnormal vascular growth phenotype. Based on previously
published work and novel preliminary data presented with this application, we hypothesize that exposure of
pulmonary vascular smooth muscle to excessive pressure and blood flow results in sustained abnormalities of
mechanotransductive signaling that perpetuate changes in cellular glutamine and cholesterol metabolism,
promoting a dysregulated proliferative phenotype. In order to test this hypothesis, we are using a unique and
clinically relevant animal model of CHD that recapitulates an early and progressive phase of disease that is
poorly represented in other disease models. Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the role of altered glutamine
and cholesterol metabolism in facilitating an abnormal proliferative phenotype in shunt pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cells (PASMCs); 2) define the initiating and sustaining mechanisms that promote increased YAP
signaling in shunt PASMCs and delineate the role of YAP in altered cellular metabolism and proliferation; and 3)
evaluate metabolic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in a pre-clinical translational model of CHD. We will
perform parallel C13 stable isotope resolved flux of glutamine and glucose, and conduct targeted manipulation
of glutamine metabolism and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways to evaluate the impact on cellular proliferation.
We will use a novel microfluidic cell culture bioreactor to assess the initiating and sustaining mechanical stimuli
that induce the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulator YAP in shunt smooth muscle. We will also delineate
the role of YAP in altered vascular smooth muscle metabolism and proliferation by targeted genetic knockdown
of YAP and ChiP analysis. Finally, we will conduct translational evaluations of identified metabolic biomarkers
and metabolic focused therapies in our model of CHD. The structured experience outlined in this proposal will
solidify the knowledge and skills I require to transition to an independent research career and attain my long term
scientific and career goals. Furthermore, the scientific understanding acquired will help us move towards more
specific therapies for a clearly defined subset of pediatric patients with PAH, and will reveal important biologic
features of a disease process that is largely studied in only its most advanced and severe forms."

Survival studies show marked racial disparity effect in head and neck cancer between African Americans (AA)
and whites. AA may present with more advanced disease and have twice the age-adjusted mortality rate
compared with whites. Immune checkpoint inhibitors offer new hope for some patients with recurrent or
metastatic disease, but further improvement in therapy is contingent upon developing a comprehensive
immunogenetic map of neoplastic evolution in HNSCC. Nearly 20% of patients with oral cancers harbor multiple
pre-malignant lesions showing signs of dysplasia, often visually identified as leukoplakia. As some of these
lesions evolve to malignant neoplasms, they represent intermediate steps in HPV negative oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) progression. Genetic changes arising at the earliest stages of tumor development drive tumor
progression and curtail the propensity of the immune system to destroy precancerous cells. Genetic aberrations
selected during OSCC evolution can create a dysfunctional tumor immune microenvironment by upregulating
key immunomodulatory ligands that induce immune tolerance and T cell exhaustion. The role of cross-talk
between neoplastic cells and their immune microenvironment, particularly in its early developmental stages, has
yet to be elucidated. Moreover, little baseline information exists in these lesions in AA, and even less is known
about the key genetic changes that lead to progression and immune invasion in this population. The central
premise of this project is that key racial differences in both inherited and somatic genetic changes during the
progression of OSCC impact the expression of key immunomodulatory cytokines or ligands within the tumor
microenvironment in order to escape an antitumor immune response. The specific aims of this project will use
whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, high-throughput computational analyses, and tissue cell
localization methods to map the specific mutational patterns and corresponding immune landscape represented
by expression of key immunomodulatory ligands and signatures of immune tolerance and T cell exhaustion in
lesions along the pathway of oral tumorigenesis. This data will help us understand the biologic underpinnings of
the different progression pathways and interactions with the immune microenvironment. Such mapping should
provide crucial insights that have significant implications for risk assessment, tumor surveillance and treatment
interventions for OSCC in AA patients."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Loss of
substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic projections and decreased striatal dopamine
levels are the characteristic features of PD. Emerging evidence suggest that synaptic
dysfunction of dopamine neurons is an early event in the pathogenesis of PD occurring prior to
the onset of symptoms. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the
most prevalent causes of familial and sporadic PD, demonstrating an unprecedented significant
role in PD pathogenesis. A transgenic mouse model with over-expression of human LRRK2-
R1441G has been shown to recapitulate robust motor behavioral, neurochemical and
pathological features of PD. At the level of pathology, the most robust phenotype is the
axonopathy of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection, accompanied by age-dependent
hyperphosphorylated tau and DA transmission deficits. Both genetic and environmental causes
of PD have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PD.
Mitochondrial trafficking is critical for neurons’ survival and functions including synaptic
neurotransmission. However, mitochondrial trafficking and dynamics in mutant LRRK2
associated-PD has not been well studied. We find that the mitochondrial oxidant stress is
elevated in the LRRK2-R1441G mutants whereas mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial
ATP synthesis is significantly reduced. In addition, our preliminary studies uncovered early and
defining features in mitochondria trafficking and dynamics impairment: frangmented
mitochondria in SNc dopamine neurons and terminals, increased cytosolic calcum levels, tau
hyperphosphorylation, and decreased anterograde healthy mitochondrial transport. We
hypothesize that R1441G mutation impairs mitochondria trafficking and dynamics via
dysregulation of Miro1 and calcium homeostasis and pathologic tau accumulation that ultimately
result in synaptic dysfunction, energy failure and axonal degeneration. We will utilize a
combination of two-photon imaging (2PLSM) and electrophysiology recording in living brain
slices, and mouse genetics to uncover mechanisms underlying DAergic transmission deficits
and axonal degeneration in PD."

The Catholic Health Initiatives’ (CHI) Institute for Research and Innovation (CIRI) Oncology Research Alliance
(CORA) seeks to continue to support and expand a community-based cancer research network, currently
across nine states, made up of community hospitals and cancer centers and incorporate best practices in
enrolling patients to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored cancer control, prevention, and care delivery
clinical trials and other human subjects’ studies. The specific aims are: to the increase enrollment in cancer
control, prevention and care delivery clinical trials by providing access to a wide portfolio of high quality
research studies that meet the needs of CORA’s diverse populations, annually accruing 10% of new cancer
cases within the populations served by the network; identify, design and implement cancer care delivery
research (CCDR) that leads to improved models of care and translates to high quality, value-based services
throughout the oncology continuum; and expand efforts to explore and address the cancer care needs of racial
and ethnic minorities as well as other underrepresented populations. Applying CIRI’s innovative, centralized
and standardized organizational research model encompassing a network of geographically diverse
community cancer programs, CIRI will continue to provide the necessary resources for amplifying clinical trials
across the country. CORA’s geographic reach and involvement with diverse Primary and Sub-Affiliates allow it
to offer a wide portfolio of trials to large, established programs as well as small, rural sites and new regions that
historically have had limited access to cancer clinical trials. Applying best practices from CORA to all current
and new Primary and Sub-Affiliates along with increased physician engagement will increase the number of
patients screened and enrolled in clinical trials. Leveraging CHI’s unique, well-positioned standard oncology
electronic health records (OEHR), enterprise data warehouse, and analytics capability will continue to give
CORA the depth of data and access to information needed to expand CCDR. CHI's OEHR at CORA sites yield
accessible data across the network that feeds into the data warehouse. CHI’s single network tumor registry
database and OEHR make CORA responsive to requests for data around patterns of care. Lastly, the
advanced patient navigation, survivorship, and multidisciplinary conferences and disease site specific tumor
boards already in place at all Primary and Sub-Affiliate sites will support this research. Expanding to additional
health systems and sites, and adding new investigators as opportunities arise will increase the number of
patients from underrepresented populations that CORA can screen for enrollment in cancer clinical trials.
CORA Primary and Sub-Affiliates’ community outreach coordinators’ and navigators’ integrated efforts will be
utilized to improve cancer control and prevention, detection, care delivery, and treatment for these populations.
Continued growth of CORA’s community partner networks, cultural sensitivity, translation support and nurse
navigation training at all Primary and Sub-Affiliate sites will help eliminate barriers to care."

 Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are minor components of the eukaryotic membrane but major regulators of cellular
functions. The seven PIPs are critically involved in nearly every aspect of cell physiology. One of the cellular
processes regulated by PIPs is autophagy, a process essential for a broad range of cellular functions and tissue
development, and dysregulated in many human diseases. Found on late endosomes and lysosomes, PI(3,5)P2
is necessary for autophagosome maturation, and dysregulation of PI(3,5)P2 biogenesis has been linked to
several neurological disorders through defective autophagy. However, the mechanism by which PI(3,5)P2
regulates autophagy is poorly understood. PIP signaling is often mediated by lipid-protein interactions. Our
efforts in the last grant cycle have led to the development of a single-molecule assay that detects lipid interaction
with proteins in mammalian whole-cell lysates, using which we have discovered widespread PIP interactions
within the large family of human pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins. XPLN, with dual activities
as a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and an endogenous inhibitor of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), has emerged as a novel PI(3,5)P2-interacting protein, and we have also
discovered that XPLN regulates autophagy in vivo. Guided by the working hypothesis that XPLN is an effector
of PI(3,5)P2 and plays a central role in mediating PIP signaling in the regulation of autophagy, our proposed
studies will decipher the biochemical basis of XPLN-PIP interactions and how they control XPLN activity and
function. The role of XPLN phosphorylation by protein kinase C will also be investigated. We will ask how those
biochemical mechanisms underlie the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. Finally, physiological
relevance of the new mechanisms will be probed in a mouse model of injury-induced skeletal muscle
regeneration, for which autophagy is required. Our expertise in lipid signaling, strong preliminary data, and a
unique combination of biochemical, biophysical, cell biology, and animal model approaches will ensure a
successful outcome that is likely to have significant impact on the biochemical and functional understanding of
PIP signaling and regulation of autophagy."

In most cancers, heterogeneous cell composition within and between tumor samples is mirrored in complex
variations at a molecular level. This molecular complexity includes both transcriptional variation and genomic
complexity, since tumors continually evolve and acquire new mutations. Therefore, to further our understanding
of tumor evolution, it is essential to study the evolutionary dynamics between cancer genomes and
transcriptomes. However, due to the complex interplay between cancer cells and their environment, these
dynamics are still poorly understood, which presents a major bottleneck for the advancement of clinical
management and treatment of cancer patients. Recent multi-region matched DNA/RNA sequencing studies have
made significant advances in our understanding of cancer evolutionary dynamics. However, the analytical tools
used in these studies were limited to one molecular data type at a time, representing a missed opportunity for
novel biological discovery. The overall objective of this proposal is to 1) quantify, at scale, the evolutionary
dynamics between genomic and transcriptomic variations in cancer cells; and 2) link this quantity to cancer
prognosis and therapeutic response. On the methodological side, we will develop a suite of integrative
deconvolution models for matched genomic and transcriptomic data types. Multiple angles to approach the
matched data will be evaluated in separate statistical models. On the applied side, we will focus on the clinical
impact of such models on the treatment of prostate (PCa) and thyroid cancers (THCa). These two cancers rank
3rd and 12th in prevalence and are projected by the CDC to present a total of 292,810 new cases in 2021 in the
US. For both cancers, overtreatment is the most clinically urgent problem since there is no clear method to
differentiate low-risk patients from those at high risk. We hypothesize that biomarkers informed by tumor
evolutionary trajectory may identify patients who do not need further treatment. Identification of these biomarkers
would significantly improve the efficiency of clinical practice. Our research group consists of experienced
investigators with complementary expertise in tumor heterogeneity and clinical management of cancers.
Together, we propose the following Aims: 1. Develop integrative deconvolution models to study the evolution of
transcriptomes in cancer cells, 1A) at the cell-type and gene levels, 1B) at single-nucleotide-variant level, 1C)
genomic heterogeneity over a multi-sample design, and 1D) transcriptomic heterogeneity over a multi-sample
design; 2. Apply integrative models to cancer patients for biomarker discovery in 2A) high-risk prostate cancer
and 2B) high-risk thyroid cancer; 3. Develop user-friendly and computationally efficient software tools for cancer
genomics. The proposed methods and tools are expected to open new avenues to discovery by enabling
comprehensive profiling of tumor cell types over evolution and associating these values with clinical outcomes.
Our proof-of-principle investigation of prostate and thyroid cancers has the potential to identify new integrative
biomarkers predictive of cancer prognosis and response to treatment."

The overall goal of this K08 Mentored Career Development proposal is to provide me with the essential
mentorship and career development opportunities, necessary to become an independent investigator with
expertise in translational research. Kidney cancer is among the top ten most common cancers, with an estimated
76,000 new cases every year in the Uniter States. Management of patients with localized or locally advanced
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) involves surgical resection, following which, half of the patients will have
a recurrence within five years. Adoption of adjuvant therapies to lower this risk has been poor due to inconsistent
results across trials. There is a lack of biomarkers to predict the recurrence risk accurately, a critical barrier in
directing adjuvant therapies to this group of patients. This proposal will investigate novel translational approaches
to identify patients at high risk of relapse after surgical removal of the primary kidney tumor. In Specific Aim 1, I
hypothesize that a prognostic transcriptomic signature comprised of genes corresponding to electron transport
chain (ETC), mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRP) and major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) will result
in stratification of localized ccRCC tumors into the two subtypes- those at risk of early relapse vs. not. In Specific
Aim 2, I hypothesize that Cu-bound to mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (Cu-COX), measured by size
exclusion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry will be indicative of mitochondrial
respiration and will be predictive of early relapse, thus making for a simple and inexpensive biomarker. In
addition, we will be evaluating the clinical relevance of different pools of copper in serum as predictors of high
copper content in corresponding ccRCC tumors, thus enabling a serum-based biomarker to detect aggressive
ccRCC. Data generated from this proposal will allow me to perform additional research, including validation of
these biomarkers in larger studies, development of novel clinical-trials to direct adjuvant therapies in a biomarker
specified population at high risk of relapse, and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with kidney cancer.
University of Cincinnati, provides me collaborative opportunities with several laboratory and clinical researchers,
thus making this an ideal environment to conduct my research while providing clinical and administrative support.
My background in clinical and translational cancer research, including experience in collaborating with laboratory
scientists and focus on biomarker development, will help me to successfully attain my short-term goals including
training in the fields of cancer biology, functional genomics and bioinformatics. To this end, I have assembled a
team of mentors and advisors, all of whom are expert investigators in these disciplines. To supplement my
training aims, I plan on completing relevant workshops. Through the K08 Career Development Award Program,
I will generate data, and enhance knowledge and skills in translational research to submit an R01 application,
and ultimately transition to an independent investigator."
10898051,"Project Summary:
It is well established that defects in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways accelerate tumorigenesis.
Significant efforts have been devoted to target defective DDR pathways to improve outcome for cancer patients.
These efforts led to the FDA’s approval of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of cancers carrying BRCA1/2
mutations and also the approval of immunotherapy for cancers with mismatch repair deficiency. Moreover, many
inhibitors targeting DNA repair and/or cell cycle checkpoints have also entered clinical trials. Thus, there is an
urgent need to understand how to effectively use these existing and new therapies for cancer treatment.
We now know that targeting DDR pathways and/or DDR defects not only affect intrinsic tumor proliferation, but
also change tumor-microenvironment interactions. Thus, we are expanding our DDR studies from in vitro to in
vivo settings. In this project, we will determine mechanistically how several essential DDR genes/proteins control
cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. We plan to establish separation of function mutations to further
elucidate the key roles of these DDR genes and pathways both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we will
investigate DDR defects in cancer therapy in vivo. Our recent success with in vivo CRISPR screens provides us
an opportunity to explore avenues to target DDR pathways and DDR defects for cancer treatment in vivo. We
anticipate that knowledge gained from these studies will help us design better treatment strategies for cancer
patients."
10898053,"Summary
Advanced emphysema is primarily characterized by chronic inflammation, small airways obstruction, and
parenchymal destruction leading to hyperinflation, compromised respiratory mechanics, and progressive
functional decline. Medical therapy has proven effective in treating symptoms such as coughing and shortness
of breath, and can also help to prevent acute exacerbations, but does little to improve either mortality or restore
lost function. While lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has demonstrated the ability to improve lung function,
quality of life and mortality in certain, rigorously selected patients, it is associated with a significant increase in
perioperative and short-term morbidity and remains an underutilized treatment.
In 2018, treatment with Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV) became the first bronchoscopic lung volume
reduction technique to receive FDA approval. Valves are inserted via catheter in order to occlude a target
emphysematous lobe, causing partial or complete lobar atelectasis, decreasing residual volume, reducing
hyperinflation and improving breathing mechanics and lung function similarly to LVRS with improved morbidity
and mortality. Despite numerous studies demonstrating clinically significant average improvements in various
functional and anatomical outcome measures, however, there currently remain a significant number of EBV
recipients who fail to experience meaningful quality of life benefits as a result.
In order to address this discrepancy, the proposed project will use hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI's unique ability
to measure regional lung function, in combination with the assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, to
attain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which EBV placement perturbs and
alters the lung. We hypothesize that this consists primarily of a redistribution of both ventilation and perfusion to
the healthier lung as well as a decrease in both local and systemic inflammatory burden—and that sensitively
assessing the presence/absence of these changes, as well as their degree, will help to explain the frequent
divergence between quantitative and qualitative assessments of EBV treatment efficacy.
Using a previously developed multi-breath hyperpolarized 129Xe buildup/washout sequence, combined with a
measurement of signal intensity buildup, to produce quantitative maps of minute ventilation and functional
residual capacity, we will quantify ventilation redistribution and residual volume at a lobar or segmental level.
These maps are compared to registered and segmented CT-derived measurements of airways disease and
emphysema. Next, we will employ HP 129Xe dissolved-phase imaging to quantify gas uptake by the red blood
cells in the lung—a measurement that relates more closely to blood oxygenation than measurements of
perfusion, and investigate the use of dynamic airflow imaging to distinguish clinically important cases of collateral
ventilation and leakage around the valve. Finally, we will evaluate a number of systemic inflammatory
biomarkers, as well as inflammatory cells such as activated macrophages and CD8+ T cells, whose presence
we will attempt to correlate with subjectively quality of life assessments post-treatment."

 This proposal details a comprehensive training program for a mentored career development award in
functional genomics and systems biology and its application to cardiovascular disease. The applicant seeks to
use proteomics and human genetics to provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis that
can be tested, mechanistically in small animal models. The candidate is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard
Medical School and the Director of Cardiovascular Genetics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The
outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s strong background in bioinformatics following his Master of
Biomedical Informatics from Harvard Medical School, to new areas of expertise: computational genomics and
small animal model systems. The candidate’s mentor is a renowned expert in molecular profiling using omic
technologies and retro-translating novel findings back to the bench in small animal models of disease. The
candidate’s scientific advisory committee has a distinguished track record of mentorship and extensive
expertise in monocyte biology, murine models of atherosclerosis, human genetics and bioinformatics.
 The proposed research builds on preliminary studies showing an association of SECTM1, a poorly
studied protein with proposed chemokine activity for monocytes and regulator of macrophage phagocytosis,
with the development of coronary heart disease in the Jackson Heart Study using proteomic profiling. The
applicant now proposes to test the hypothesis that SECTM1 is novel regulator of monocyte biology and
contributes to atherosclerosis formation using a murine model of disease. In Aim 1, the applicant will
determine the effect of SECTM1a on the proliferation of monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow and its
associated pathways. In Aim 2, the applicant will assess the effect of SECTM1a on atherosclerosis lesion
formation in mouse models. In Aim 3, the applicant will test the causal association of SECTM1 with other
circulating proteins using Mendelian randomization studies to inform new biology of SECTM1-related pathways
in humans and will provide a springboard for future mechanistic studies in small animal models.
 Coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, despite the substantial
advancements in our understanding of disease pathways and preventative treatments. A large body of
evidence has implicated inflammation as a key contributor to the residual burden of disease, with monocytes
being important mediators of these processes. The proposal aims to use functional genomics and a systems
biology approach towards delineating novel inflammatory pathways towards development of atherosclerosis
that has the potential for new targets for preventative treatments for coronary heart disease."
10897958,"Project Summary/Abstract
Most pathogenic bacteria express surface carbohydrates called capsular polysaccharides (CPSs). CPSs are
important vaccine candidates given that they are located on the outermost surface of bacteria and have distinct
structures. These two features make them easily accessible and distinctly recognizable by immune
surveillance, therefore resulting in the production of CPS-specific antibodies by B cells. To induce a CPS-
specific adaptive immune response (i.e., T cell-mediated B cell response), CPSs are conjugated with carrier
proteins, and the conjugation products are called glycoconjugate vaccines. Due to insufficient understanding of
their immune activation mechanisms, current glycoconjugate vaccine strategies have reached saturation and
are largely modifications of past empirical conjugation methods. The production of the current generation of
glycoconjugate vaccines is based on trial and error and does not make use of specific scientific knowledge to
maximize stimulation of critical immune cells (i.e., helper T cells) involved in producing protective IgG
antibodies. A new perspective on carbohydrate-based vaccine research is much needed. With the potential of
establishing a new paradigm, our previous discovery and preliminary data demonstrate that the mammalian
CD4+ T cell repertoire contains a population of T cells that recognize carbohydrate epitopes of glycoconjugate
vaccines, called Tcarbs. Building on our previous mechanistic work, we propose establishing a platform to
design and develop structurally defined glycoconjugate vaccines optimized for their immunogenic and
antigenic components to elicit protective immunity consistently and effectively. This proposal also addresses
another key parameter controlling the immunogenicity of conjugate vaccines, which is to identify the immune
correlates of protection induced by glycoconjugate vaccine immunization. In clinical practice, improving on
measuring CPS-specific antibody titers and the in vitro opsonophagocytic activity as immune correlates of
protection is an essential milestone to achieve for the reliable prediction of clinical efficacy. We propose to
identify key helper T cell populations that are essential for vaccine efficacy as a new immune correlate of
protection. Exploiting CPSs from two highly pathogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) serotypes—Spn3
and Spn14—and building on our published and unpublished preliminary studies, we will establish a new and
broadly applicable conjugate vaccine platform and characterize immune responses that result from these
vaccines through two specific aims. Aim 1: Establish a knowledge-based conjugate vaccine platform
composed of endolysosome-cleavable polypeptide chains chemoenzymatically conjugated with CPSs. Aim 2:
Isolate and functionally characterize human Tcarb clones for their ability to induce protective humoral immunity"
10897960,"The study of persons with or at-risk for genetically-determined autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s
disease (ADAD) due to mutations in the PSEN and APP genes has made tremendous contributions to
our understanding of AD in general. As the future development of AD in persons inheriting ADAD
mutations can be reliably predicted, one can define the disease phenotype and changes occurring
during the presymptomatic phase of the disease with great sensitivity, enabling the evaluation of other
factors influencing disease course (e.g. modifying genes, effects of putative disease-modifying
interventions). Such research is facilitated by the identification of large families sharing the same
genetic predisposition, an approach that has been best implemented in an extended family in Colombia
with a common mutation in PSEN1 (E280A). A similar founder effect for a distinct mutation in PSEN1
(A431E) and another large family with a different ADAD-causing mutation in APP (V717I) has been
identified in the State of Jalisco in Mexico but to date these families have been understudied. The goal
of the current application is to facilitate the performance of clinical studies of this population by
investigators in Jalisco. This will be achieved through the following specific aims:
Specific Aim #1) To characterize and follow persons with and at-risk for ADAD in Jalisco by
harmonizing measures between the Centro de Investigación Biomédica de Occidente Genetics clinic in
Guadalajara, the University of Guadalajara Polyclinic in Tepatitlan, and the USC Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center. By providing gene-sequencing technology and training, we will also enable the
genetic characterization of this population.
Specific Aim #2) To perform studies to identify genes that affect the age of disease onset and the
presence of leg stiffness in ADAD.
Specific Aim #3) To improve the ability of clinicians and researchers in Jalisco to deliver
presymptomatic genetic counseling for persons at-risk for ADAD, thus optimizing autonomy with
regards to research participation.
 This project will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of ADAD and lay the
groundwork for future studies of this informative population in Mexico."
10897961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Leukemia therapy remains challenging and options are limited for a large fraction of patients who relapse.
Growing evidence suggests that the therapy outcome and failure in myeloid leukemias are intimately linked
to properties of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Quiescence is a fundamental property shared between LSCs
and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Thus, targeting quiescent leukemic stem cells is essential for a
successful long-lasting leukemia therapy. Achieving this goal requires identification of building blocks of stem
cell quiescence and an in-depth understanding of mechanisms that wire them together. By exploiting
mitochondrial heterogeneity we identified discrete deeply quiescent and potent subsets of mouse and human
HSCs. This led us to our discovery that lysosomal activity is heterogeneous in HSCs and key in maintaining
their quiescence. We find lysosomes retain damaged mitochondria and that they are critical to the
maintenance of HSC quiescence and metabolism. We have extended these studies to myeloid leukemias,
using both a mouse model of pre-leukemia and leukemia as well as leukemic patients’ samples and find that
leukemic stem cell populations are heterogeneous distinctively in their lysosomal and mitochondrial
properties. Based on our combined results we propose to investigate the implications of lysosomal
heterogeneity for LSC isolation, generation and maintenance. In Aim 1, we will take advantage of combined
lysosomal and mitochondrial heterogeneity to select LSCs subsets for further investigating their distinct
function related to their lysosomal and mitochondrial alterations; in Aim 2, we will investigate the modulation
of lysosomal-mediated metabolic pathways in LSC subsets; and in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential of
dysregulated lysosomes in mediating the generation of pre-leukemic stem cells. Altogether these studies are
likely to improve our approaches for isolating LSCs and our understanding of LSC generation and
maintenance."

This K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient Oriented Research (POR) will leverage my existing POR
program, enhance my professional development and that of my trainees, and support my ongoing efforts to
provide essential mentoring to early stage clinical investigators in POR in the rheumatic and musculoskeletal
diseases (RMDs), with a focus on osteoarthritis (OA) and health equity. Despite being a highly prevalent and
serious disease, OA lacks effective therapies and remains a large burden on individuals and the health care
system. We have published extensively on sex, race, and socioeconomic differences in various aspects of OA
based on our experience with two diverse population-based cohorts, the Johnston County OA Project
(JoCoOA) and the Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS). My POR career has focused on aspects of OA
epidemiology, imaging, and biomarkers, with a more recent emphasis on identifying phenotypes using machine
learning and precision medicine to improve studies and management of this chronic disease. It is essential to
understand the role of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, in either improving or perpetuating
health inequities such as those known to exist in OA. Such advanced approaches, if applied appropriately, will
likely provide new insights on phenotypes of OA, and inform therapeutics in diverse populations with the
objective of improving health equity. Further, the intersection of POR, health equity, and machine learning is of
great interest to trainees and an area of critical need for training future clinician scientists in RMDs, which is the
goal of the K24 mechanism. We will leverage existing data from the JoCoOA, a 30-year longitudinal study of
over 4000 Black and White men and women aged 45 and older, and the new JoCoHS, an actively enrolling
cohort (2019-, n~1500) that includes individuals who are 35-70 years of age and who identify as Hispanic,
Black, or White. We will utilize these rich data sources and our extensive institutional resources to address two
specific aims around subgroups of pain and symptoms and their associations with structure and function, with
a focus on health equity. In Aim 1, we will work to validate and optimize a deep learning algorithm in these
diverse cohorts to better define the association between radiographic features and the pain experience in knee
OA. In Aim 2, we will characterize symptomatic phenotypes in the JoCoHS cohort (which has more extensive
available symptomatic data), and associate these with the radiographic information gleaned in Aim 1 as well as
validated assessments of function and physical activity, to identify subgroups that could most benefit from
targeted interventions. This K24 project will provide crucial protected time and resources to promote my
professional development and enhance my mentoring capabilities while simultaneously providing a
springboard for trainees to 1) develop their research skills in the context of individualized projects, 2) develop
critical skills in big data analytics and machine learning-based methodology, and 3) answer key POR questions
in RMDs and OA through a diversity and health equity lens."

The characterization pipelines built by the VU Biomolecular Multimodal Imaging Center (BIOMIC) Data Analysis
Core (DAC) will produce a multimodal molecular atlas of kidney across multiple scales in 2-D and 3-D, comprising
rich and varied molecular data from MALDI IMS, MxIF, CODEX, spatial and non-spatial proteomics/
transcriptomics, united by common spatial coordinate space. The DAC will build on our previous developments,
including spatial segmentation for both acquisition and analysis, comprehensive molecular identification across
modalities, automated data mining across modalities by spatial masks using clinical and temporal cues, and
situating data within an “average” human kidney developed from 1000s of medical images. In Aim 1 we will
further develop and scale our modality-specific processing methods to prepare the different measurement types
for subsequent spatial integration, multimodal analysis, and content/cross-omic relationship mining. Aim 2 will
focus on expanding and scaling our characterization pipeline, bringing together the broad array of distinct
imaging and -omics measurement types individually processed by the methods in Aim 1. By integrating these
varied datasets spatially, temporally, as well as content-wise, we will empirically mine them for cross-modal and
molecular-functional relationships. These technologies will establish both 2-D and 3-D multimodal tissue maps
that concurrently report hundreds to thousands of biomolecules at cellular resolutions, together with
corresponding functional and cell type annotations. In Aim 3 we will compose all spatial and molecular
information into a reference atlas by expanding the spatio-temporal mapping of molecular variation, organization,
and function beyond single tissue block analyses (as in Aim 2) to multi-block and multi-donor tissue cohorts.
Finally, Aim 4 will enable continued coordination with the HuBMAP consortium and HIVE team members by
integrating our analyses into the HIVE’s ASCT+B tables for interactive exploration, visualization, and searchable

10884880,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Kidney OSP.
The overall structure and anatomical relationships among different cell types within the human kidney are well
understood, and experimental studies have defined the molecular and functional characteristics of individual
kidney cell types. However, remarkably little is known about the integration, interactions, and molecular cross-
talk between the different cellular compartments in normal kidneys. The goal of the Kidney OSP is to address
this limitation in current knowledge by developing a fully integrated, multimodal molecular imaging pipeline to
characterize the cellular and molecular organization of the human kidney. Building on our already established
HuBMAP characterization pipeline, we will bring together imaging mass spectrometry, highly multiplexed
immunofluorescence microscopy, autofluorescence microscopy, stained microscopy, spatial transcriptomics,
spatial proteomics, and single-cell RNA-seq. Each modality was specifically chosen to enable the construction
of a kidney molecular atlas that spans a wide range of spatial scales (e.g., single cells, functional tissue units,
neighborhoods, and whole organs) and molecular classes (e.g., metabolites, lipids, proteins, and RNAs). The
result will be a comprehensive molecular atlas of the human kidney that will be fully compatible with other
molecular interrogation pipelines and data generated by HuBMAP researchers. In Aim 1 we will continue our
kidney tissue collection and management protocols that build on our established kidney biobanks and tissue
acquisition programs to create a representative molecular atlas of the human kidney. Aim 2 establishes clinical
and histological standards and metrics that will be used to determine the suitability of samples that can be
entered into the analytical pipeline. The focus of Aim 3 puts forth a strategy for 2-D and 3-D multimodal imaging
and deep multi-omic analysis of the human kidney. Assay development on surgical resection specimens will be
applied to whole organs using non-transplantable donor kidneys to construct 3-D molecular atlases. Finally, Aim
4 will scale up the kidney-specific characterization pipeline to generate representative 3-D molecular atlases
from multiple, intact human kidneys."

The Kansas PKD RTCC has created three biomedical research cores to support the research programs of
external core users in the PKD Research Consortium and the greater PKD research community. These cores
are: Core 1. Biomarkers, Biomaterials, and Cellular Models (Darren Wallace, Director), Core 2. Rodent Models
& Drug Testing (Pamela Tran and Stephen Parnell, Co-Directors), and Core 3. Clinical Research (Alan Yu,
Director). The Administrative Core will be responsible for setting the overall scientific direction of the Kansas

 This renewal proposal is to fund waves 5 (2021) and 6 (2024) of the China Health and Retirement Study
(CHARLS). The overarching goal is to further develop a first rate longitudinal, public use, aging survey for China

 The CHARLS national baseline survey was conducted in 2011-12. It is a nationally representative survey
that includes one person per household aged 45 years of age or older and their spouse (totaling 17,708 individuals)
living in 10,257 households in 450 villages/urban communities in 150 counties/districts in 28 of China’s 30
provinces excluding Tibet. Waves 2, 3 and 4 were fielded in 2013, 2015 and 2018 respectively. Some 86.5% of
wave 1 respondents were re-contacted in wave 4. A special wave to collect life history data was fielded in 2014,
using resources from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and other sources. In wave 4 we
added a Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP), harmonized to similar efforts in the US, Mexico,
England, South Africa and India; to measure dimensions of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) for
respondents 60 and over. We will continue CHARLS HCAP for all respondents 60 and over in wave 6 and for a
subset of respondents in wave 5.
 Waves 5 and 6 for CHARLS would provide data over a 13 year period for those beginning in wave 1.This
will allow not only examining longer-run consequences of events that occurred earlier in life, but also to follow the
time-path of these outcomes. This will also enable research on causal links between health behaviors,
environment or policy changes and health outcomes. Each wave of the CHARLS data has always been released
publicly, for free, within one and one half years of the end of data collection. This practice will continue into the
future."

Dopamine controls movement, learning, motivation and reward, and changes in its signaling are associated with
drug addiction and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dopamine operates through multiple modes, including tonic and
phasic signaling, and mechanisms of dopamine in the regulation of behavior continue to be debated. Recent
studies on movement, for example, have suggested that rapid, phasic dopamine triggers movement and
instructed models on the moment-to-moment roles of dopamine in striatal regulation. These models are
contrasted by clinical work that aims at providing stable dopamine levels for PD treatment.
The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms of dopamine in the control of behavior. We
hypothesize that distinct dopamine signaling modes employ activity-dependent and -independent release
mechanisms for producing two-component control of behavioral output. Select roles of dopamine require firing
activity, while many permissive roles can be fulfilled by a release mechanism that does not rely on action
potential-firing. We have developed mouse mutants and acute manipulations to abolish action potential-
induced dopamine release and rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics. In these mutants, movement initiation is
unperturbed, and the mice can learn to make easy, binary decisions. In contrast, motivation, invigoration of
reward-oriented behavior, and prediction error-based learning are impaired. These data indicate the need for a
departure from the model that phasic dopamine triggers movement and justify in-depth analyses of dopamine in
reinforcement learning with the new approaches we established.
We will study striatal dopamine modulation in movement and reinforcement learning. Using the newly generated
tools, we will pursue a range of behavioral assays and simultaneously assess in vivo dopamine dynamics with
fluorescent dopamine sensors and neural activity with calcium indicators. In aim 1, we propose to establish
relationships between dopamine and striatal output during movement. We measure dopamine dynamics,
dopamine axon activity and medium spiny neuron activity during movement initiation and test for the roles of
dopamine release in movement and striatal regulation. In aim 2, we dissect mechanisms of dopamine in
reinforcement learning. We propose a step-wise, systematic approach to assess the necessity for action
potential-induced dopamine release in prediction error-based learning, motivation, motor skill learning, cocaine
self-administration and drug seeking.
This multiple PI project builds on the expertise of Pascal Kaeser, an expert in the biology of dopamine
transmission, and Naoshige Uchida, an expert in behavioral dopamine research. Our work will solve central
discrepancies in models of dopamine action in movement control and will likely establish roles for precise
dopamine signaling in reinforcement learning. The knowledge we generate may ultimately help revise strategies
for treating diseases with altered dopamine function, for example drug addiction."

Understanding biomarkers of cognitive decline in Lewy body diseases
While patients with Lewy body diseases (LBD) share the core feature of deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein
(aSyn) into neuropathological inclusions, they exhibit pronounced heterogeneity in both initial clinical
phenomenology, as well as in trajectory of outcomes. The underlying reasons for these differences in
phenomenology among LBD patients – patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), with or without dementia, as
well as patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) – are poorly understood. However, these differences
matter greatly for quality of life for patients and their families, as well as costs to the healthcare system, making
cognitive decline in the LBD one of the most important Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD) facing
our aging population. This RO1 renewal application seeks to uncover, using biomarker screening approaches,
the molecular correlates of cognitive heterogeneity in the LBD. However, we do not plan to stop there. Instead,
based on data generated in the first period of funding, we posit that biomarker-derived leads represent an
untapped opportunity to identify key players in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in the LBD. We thus propose
to also investigate our more mature leads in model systems, with the goal of developing targets for therapeutic
development. We have two specific aims, focused on the underlying premise that host characteristics (reflected
by biomarker signatures) and “proteinopathy” characteristics (reflected by differences in aSyn) together
determine cognitive trajectory in the LBD.
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Investigate the contribution of host characteristics to cognitive heterogeneity in the
LBD. We will screen CSF samples from 150 PD patients to identify proteins associating with cognitive outcome,
and we will cross-reference “hits” against plasma biomarkers or genomic variants previously found to associate
with the same phenotype. We will elucidate the role of our previously-discovered, biomarker-derived leads
Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and Melanoma inhibitory activity protein (MIA) in the pathogenesis of LBD, using
induced pluripotent stem-cell derived neurons (iPSC-N) and microglia (iMicroglia), as well as in vivo models.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Investigate the contribution of aSyn species to cognitive heterogeneity in the LBD. We
have discovered that plasma species of aSyn recognized by two conformation-selective monoclonal antibodies
(termed Strain A and Strain B aSyn) discriminate PD from DLB. We will biochemically and cell biologically
characterize these two strains of aSyn using proteinase K digestion, mass-spectrometry-based methods, real-
time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays, and iPSC-N seeding models."

 Mammalian rod and cone photoreceptors are indispensible for vision. They convert light into an electrical
responses, which are then propagated across the retinal circuitry and into the brain. Fundamental to this
information transmission is the specificity of synaptic connections between rod and cone photoreceptors and
their downstream partners, the bipolar cells. Deficits in synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and
bipolar cells are known to cause congenital stationary blindness in humans, a condition characterized by poor
light sensitivity and is a frequent co-morbidity with many other ocular conditions. Our long term goal is to
elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which photoreceptors establish synapses with bipolar cells.
We believe that a better understand of the mechanisms underlying blinding conditions will ultimately help in
devising strategies for their treatment.
 In this renewal application, we will continue our highly productive Multi-PI team effort that thus far has led
to major advances in understanding photoreceptor synaptic biology, We now turn our attention to a radically
new set of trans-synaptic adhesion molecules at cone synapses. Specifically, we will focus on the molecules
LRIT1 and adhesion GPCR – LPHN3, which our preliminary data show operate at cone synapses. Through cell
biological, biochemical, electrophysiological (single cell and whole retina), and behavioral experiments we will
elucidate the mechanism of action LRIT1 and LPHN3, which will reveal key properties of these synapses that
support vision over a wide range of light intensities. We hypothesize that LRIT1 and LPHN3 are critically
involved in shaping the function of CaV1.4 calcium channels that mediate neurotransmitter from photoreceptor
terminals through mechanisms that in part that involve inhibitory feedback between cones through horizontal
cells. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two complementary Specific Aims that will (i) investigate
mechanistic role of LRIT1 in controlling the cone photoreceptor output, and (ii) elucidate the molecular basis of
LPHN3 effects from horizontal cells in regulating calcium channel activity at cone photoreceptor terminals."
