10907711,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Nationwide Children’s Hospital
Nationwide Children’s Hospital (54 pediatric ICU beds and 20 cardiothoracic ICU beds with a combined annual 
census of >3,500 patients) and our Ancillary Site, Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital (24 pediatric ICU 
beds with an annual census of >1,600 patients), will be strong assets to the 4th cycle of the Collaborative 
Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). The overall aim of this proposal is to advance the field 
of pediatric critical care medicine through the collaborative development and execution of transformative 
studies that benefit critically ill children. As one of the current CPCCRN sites, we (Hall – PI, Yates – Co-I, 
Steel – RC) have consistently been leaders in subject enrollment and project development. Dr. Hall’s Immune 
Surveillance Laboratory (ISL) at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital has 
served a central role in the two interventional drug trials performed by the network this cycle. These trials 
using the immunostimulant drug GM-CSF for the reversal of critical illness-induced immune suppression, 
established the safety and feasibility of multi-center, real-time immune function monitoring and modulation in 
our hands and, along with the current cycle’s PHENOMS sepsis phenotyping study, led us directly to the 
proposed study, “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS”. This study includes two distinct, 
embedded, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of immunomodulation that are tailored to 
each subject’s prospectively-tested immune phenotype. The ISL will provide highly standardized immune 
function and inflammation testing kits with which the network already has extensive experience. Subjects who 
are found to have severe immune suppression without severe inflammation will be allocated to the “GM-CSF 
for Reversal of Immunoparalysis in Sepsis-induced MODS (GRACE)-2” study where they will receive GM-CSF 
or placebo. Subjects with moderate to severe systemic inflammation will be allocated to the “Targeted 
Reversal of Inflammation in Pediatric Sepsis-induced MODS (TRIPS)” study in which subjects will be 
adaptively randomized to receive the anti-inflammatory drugs anakinra, tocilizumab, or placebo. This highly 
innovative approach is designed to ensure that the right subject receives the right immune care that matches 
their immunologic derangement. Our primary outcome, the cumulative PELOD-2 score over 28 days, will 
assess both ICU morbidity and mortality, and our secondary outcomes will assess long term morbidity and 
health-related quality of life. This project is an ideal platform for ancillary studies and will represent a 
transformative approach to sepsis care in children. Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Rainbow Babies and 
Children’s Hospital (Shein – PI, Slain – Co-I) are certain to be strong contributors and collaborators in the next 
cycle of CPCCRN and will help move our field forward through the generation of new, generalizable knowledge 
that will inform the treatment of critically ill children."

Our overarching objective in joining the newly organized and expanded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care 
Research Network (CPCCRN) as a new site is to enhance the scientific breadth and reach of the network to 
maximize its public health impact and improve outcomes for critically ill children. Our site, consisting of Duke 
University (primary site) in Durham, North Carolina, and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC; 
ancillary site) in Charleston, South Carolina, provides comprehensive care to > 4000 critically ill children per 
year in both states. Our sites provide access to 89 combined pediatric intensive care bed, and together, we will 
ensure that all critically ill children in the Carolinas have access to cutting edge clinical trials and research 
studies performed by the CPCCRN. We are committed to improving outcomes of critically ill children through 
collaborative multicenter clinical research. Over the past 3 years, we have enrolled >400 critically ill children in 
15 clinical studies conducted at Duke and coordinated by leading multicenter clinical research networks. Our 
site based research team is supported by a comprehensive departmental and school of medicine wide clinical 
research infrastructure that provides full service administrative, financial, regulatory, and scientific support. Our 
proposed research coordinator, Mrs Harward, has >5 years of experience conducting multicenter clinical trials 
in critically ill children. Our proposed principal investigator, Dr. Hornik, has dedicated his professional life to 
improving outcomes of critically ill children through the development of safe and effective drugs and 
interventions. Dr. Hornik is board certified in pediatric critical care medicine and cardiology, has advanced 
training in biostatistics and pharmaceutical sciences, and a track record of enrolling critically ill children in 
clinical trials and mentoring early-career investigators. As a faculty member in both the Department of 
Pediatrics and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), the world’s largest academic research 
organization, Dr. Hornik built a research and leadership portfolio ideally suited to enhance the scientific breadth 
of the CPCCRN. Leveraging our experience coordinating large multicenter pediatric clinical research networks, 
including the NICHD funded Pediatric Trials Network, the FDA supported Global Pediatric Clinical Trials 
Network, and the NCATS Trial Innovations Network, and the resources accessible through the Division of 
Quantitative Sciences and the DCRI Pharmacometrics Center, we will provide deep scientific expertise and 
training and mentoring opportunities for CPCCRN investigators in the areas of clinical pharmacology, real-world evidence generation, and regulatory science. Through our clinical reach and scientific expertise, we will 
contribute significantly to the success of the CPCCRN, development of talented clinician scientists, and 
completion of our highly innovative clinical trial aimed at reducing the morbidity and mortality of MODS in 
critically ill infants and children."
10900563,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles 
This application details the qualifications, interest and commitment of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) 
to be a member of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). 
CHLA and its investigators in the division of critical care are international experts in pediatric mechanical 
ventilation, Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PARDS), informatics and data science. Led by Dr. 
Khemani (PI) and Dr. Newth (Co-I), the multi-disciplinary CHLA respiratory research group and its members 
have led large multi-center observational studies in PARDS (PARDIE study, 145 international ICUs), and have 
spearheaded international practice guidelines related to mechanical ventilation and PARDS. This group is 
currently running a highly innovative single center clinical trial using a computerized decision support tool 
targeting lung and diaphragm protective ventilation in pediatric ARDS, which includes comprehensive 
assessment of post-ICU morbidity. These unique qualifications and expertise will greatly enrich the scientific 
rigor and breadth of knowledge within the CPCCRN. In addition, other CHLA investigators are pioneers in data 
science, neurocritical care and implementation science, and will bring this expertise to the CPCCRN. CHLA is 
at the forefront of collaborative research, with several faculty holding leadership positions in the Pediatric Acute 
Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) Network, the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group, and 
multi-center data collaboratives such as VPS, VPICU, and the PICU Data Collaborative. This expertise 
underscores our faculty’s ability to be highly collaborative in a research network to achieve common goals. It is 
therefore not surprising that CHLA has been the highest enroller in a multitude of multi-center clinical trials and 
observational studies in pediatric critical care. To further enhance our ability to recruit a large number of 
diverse patients into the CPCCRN studies, we will partner with an ancillary site at Children’s Hospital of 
Orange County (CHOC). CHOC has been participating in multi-center collaborative research through the 
PALISI network for over 10 years and has also achieved remarkably high enrollment rates in clinical trials. 
Through our two centers, we can ensure that the clinical trial(s) conducted in the CPCCRN capture the unique 
ethnic, racial, and socio-economic diversity of Southern California which includes > 50% of patients being of 
Hispanic ethnicity. This is imperative for the proposed clinical trial on immune-modulation in sepsis, given the 
impact that genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and socio-economic factors may have on treatment and 
outcomes. Our site has several highly talented faculty and junior investigators who will not only contribute to 
the success of the CPCCRN but can be further mentored and developed into future thought leaders and 
clinical/translational researchers through the CPCCRN. CHLA is fully committed to be an engaged and highly 
productive member of the CPCCRN and execute the clinical trial described in the application."

The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Children’s Hospital has been a Clinical Site in the 
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Collaborative Pediatric 
Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) since 2014 (3rd cycle) and is enthusiastic about participating as a 
Clinical Hub in the newly organized and expanded network. During the 3rd cycle, Dr Anil Sapru (original PI) 
relocated to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and UCLA joined UCSF as a consortium site. More 
recently UCSF has affiliated with the former Children’s Hospital Oakland resulting in the new Benioff Children’s 
Hospitals at San Francisco (BCHSF) and Oakland (BCHO). Thus, BCHSF and BCHO, along with UCLA, will 
comprise a clinical consortium or hub site in the present site application. We will work closely with our ancillary 
site, University of California, Davis Children’s Hospital. In combination with this partner, our site will provide 
access to 104 PICU beds with approximately 4500 annual admissions, enabling us to participate fully in the 
“Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS” trial described in the Overall Component of this 
application. Our site proposal has three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Actively collaborate in implementation 
of CPCCRN, including participation on the Steering Committee and other committees, attendance at meetings, 
facilitating contracting with the Data Coordinating Center, and complying with the standard operating 
procedures and performance expectations of the network. Specific Aim 2. Provide opportunities for young 
investigators to participate in CPCCRN meetings, committees, or trial implementation, with the goal of 
developing these talented individuals into fundable clinician scientists. Specific Aim 3. Implement the 
Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS trial, including enrollment of patients by trained 
research staff, adhering to the study protocol, prompt data entry, and full compliance with Good Clinical

10854952,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRAINING CORE
This new U2C/TL1 application is responsive to calls for developing an innovative interdisciplinary training 
program to strengthen the Kidney, Urology Hematology (KUH) research workforce in order to address capacity 
building for KUH research. Chief obstacles to designing and implementing a successful interdisciplinary 
research training program include limitations in training assets, research and mentorship expertise, and 
opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration. To overcome these obstacles, the Training Core of the
Chicago Kidney Urology Hematology network FOR city-Wide reseArch tRaining and career Development 
(Chicago KUH FORWARD) will train pre- and postdoctoral KUH trainees (10 slots/career stage; 20 slots total)
across 6 institutions (Northwestern University (NU), Lurie Children’s Hospital at Chicago, University of Illinois at 
Chicago, University of Chicago, and Rush and Loyola Universities) in an innovative and integrated 
interdisciplinary training program that will converge on cross-cutting tools that can be utilized across diseases, 
fields, or questions. Unique features of the program will include adoption of general and specific competencies 
for interdisciplinary training, cross-disciplinary mentoring team, new cross-disciplinary curriculum that 
incorporates seminars, journal clubs and workshops that place emphasis on presentation of cross-cutting 
innovative tools and not specific diseases, dedicated grant writers groups, and a broad matrix of professional 
development activities that map to chosen competencies. The centerpiece of the Training Core is mentored 
cross-disciplinary research that yields scientific products. Resources provided by the Professional 
Development and Network Cores will synergize with the Training Core activities and augment career 
development of trainees. The operational hub for the Training Core will be the NU Division of Nephrology and 
Hypertension. Drs. Isakova, David, Thumbikat, and Eklund will co-lead the Training Core, and each brings
unique and complementary expertise across KUH. Co-Directors and the Co-Investigators at Chicago KUH 
FORWARD institutions will constitute the Training Core Executive Committee, which will be assisted by a 
Diversity Committee and a Trainee Selection Committee. Administrative support will be provided by the 
Program Coordinator & Manager. The 75 Training Core mentors are KUH adult and pediatric specialists, and 
clinical, basic and translational researchers. The training program will be evaluated by an Evaluation 
Associate under the supervision of Dr. Drane, a training program evaluation expert. The Chicago KUH 
FORWARD Steering Committee will serve in internal advisory capacity, whereas the Chicago KUH 
FORWARD External Evaluation Board (EEB) will provide external review. The Training Core Executive 
Committee will work with the Diversity and Trainee Selection Committees to make changes to the program in 
response to the evaluation findings. Continuous cycles of evaluations and improvements will help us achieve 
our mission of making Chicago a national hub for innovative interdisciplinary KUH research training."
10950708,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
White matter hyperintensity (WMH) seen on MRI of the brain is an important biomarker of elevated risk for stroke
and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. There are qualitative scales to measure WMH severity as well
as automated techniques that quantify WMH volumetrically. However, these techniques – manual or automated
– were developed for conventional high-field MRI and are not optimized for the unique imaging characteristics
of low-field portable MRI (pMRI). The pMRI device costs a fraction of a conventional high-field MRI, is FDA
approved, does not require magnetic shielding, can be rolled from room to room, and plugged into a standard
wall socket. Taking into account the unique imaging attributes of pMRI, we will create both a qualitative low-field
WMH scale that can be used widely and a machine learning enabled quantitative measurement of WMH for
more sophisticated applications. To ensure the reliability of these WMH measurement systems, we will enroll
100 participants who will receive both a pMRI and high-field 3T MRI at a single study visit for the purpose of
comparing WMH measurements against a gold standard (3T MRI). Using the Delphi method, an expert panel of
pMRI researchers will develop the low-field WMH grading scale, iteratively refine it, and validate it within this
cohort. Parallel to this, advanced machine learning methodologies will be utilized in this cohort, allowing for
precise quantification of WMH volume on pMRI. These advances are possible because our multidisciplinary
team has expertise that spans translational vascular research to MRI physics and computational medical
imaging. However, our vision transcends merely introducing a novel imaging measurement method; we aspire
to make brain health assessments more universally accessible and economically feasible compared to the
current hospital-based high-field MRI. Upon validation of these WMH quantification methodologies, we will
immediately make them available in our popular software package, FreeSurfer (over 60,000 worldwide licenses),
and implement them in our ongoing pMRI-based assessments of brain health in real-world settings including a
safety net emergency department and at a health center providing primary care to underserved and understudied
communities. Combining pMRI innovation with rigorous measurement techniques, we aspire to widen the reach
of brain health evaluations, encompassing a more diverse beneficiary group. By permitting early detection of
WMH in a range of healthcare or community settings, our project holds the potential to refine intervention
strategies, particularly for debilitating conditions like stroke and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."
10950992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 4.1% of new cancer cases in the United States (US) – 1 out of
every 25 diagnoses – and the number of individuals living with the disease has consistently increased over the
past five decades. When patients are diagnosed with RCC, they often ask: “What can I do to improve my
chance of survival?” A cancer diagnosis is a “teachable moment,” a time when an individual may be open to
behavior change. But what behaviors should be endorsed? As yet, sufficient data are unavailable to give
evidence-based, disease-specific lifestyle recommendations. Few studies have considered modifiable
behaviors that might improve survival. Such studies are imperative given that 14,000 individuals die from RCC
in the US each year. As such, we seek to comprehensively study the associations of dietary patterns and
physical activity with RCC survival using data from three large, prospective cohorts: the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study, Nurses’ Health Study, and Nurses’ Health Study 2. These cohorts are unique in their
collection of repeated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), physical activity assessments, and extensive
covariable data, both before and after diagnosis. They also include more than 1000 confirmed cases of RCC,
among whom roughly 300 have died from disease. In Aim 1, we will use FFQs to compute pre- and post-
diagnostic adherence to the alternative healthy eating index (AHEI) and Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH), type 2 diabetes prevention, inflammatory, and insulinemic diets. We will then evaluate
RCC-specific and overall mortality among RCC patients in relation to adherence to each pattern post-diagnosis
and change in adherence to each pattern from pre- to post-diagnosis. Due to its impact on hypertension, we
hypothesize that adherence to the DASH diet will be most strongly protective against RCC-specific mortality,
even relative to an otherwise healthy diet (AHEI). In Aim 2, we will evaluate RCC-specific and overall survival
among RCC patients in relation to post-diagnostic physical activity (including by volume, type, and intensity),
post-diagnostic sedentary behavior, and pre- to post-diagnosis change in physical (in)activity levels. We
hypothesize that increasing physical activity will be associated with a reduced risk of RCC-specific mortality
and that increasing sedentary behavior will be associated with a greater risk of RCC-specific mortality. Results
will offer first ever insights into dietary choices that improve RCC survival, and results regarding physical
(in)activity will be borne from analyses including over five times the number of outcomes as had the prior
pertinent study. Our research will thus yield a foundation for developing evidence-based lifestyle
recommendations for RCC survivors. Only equipped with data from rigorous and well powered research can
we offer RCC patients some self-determined control over their outcomes."

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), sometimes in conjunction with Speech-Language Therapy, has been
demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies.
Several lines of evidence suggest that it is more effective when provided in the subacute stage after stroke but
its efficacy in this setting has not been adequately assessed. We propose to study the effects of continuous
Theta Burst Stimulation (a type of TMS) combined with a modified form of Constraint Induced Language
Therapy (mCILT) in 63 subjects with subacute aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to cTBS with
mCILT or sham cTBS with mCILT. After pre-treatment evaluation, subjects will receive 10 days of treatment;
post-treatment evaluations will be performed 3-5 days and again at 4 months after the completion of treatment.
We will use electrical field modelling to personalize stimulation intensity for each subject. Change from
baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient at 4 months after the end of treatment will
serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of
response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the
treatment on brain organization using network neuroscience approaches. We will identify changes in the
strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the
effects of cTBS and mCILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment."
10949791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed training plan prepares Dr. Croff to develop expertise in Reminiscence Therapy, measures of
cognition and social engagement, and dissemination and implementation science. These training objectives
are supported by a team of expert mentors (Drs. Jeffrey Kaye, David Johnson, Kevin Duff, and Basia Belza)
and a consultant (Dr. Cynthia Morris) with an established history of collaboration with Dr. Croff and with the
SHARP study, the focus of the research portion of this proposal. The Sharing History through Active
Reminiscence and Photo-imagery (SHARP) study engages older Black adults in reminiscence-based walking
and social engagement to maintain or improve brain health and wellbeing. In groups of threes and using the
SHARP walking application to access routes, GPS-linked historical images of local Black life and culture
prompt conversational reminiscence as they walk within gentrifying Black neighborhoods. Dr. Croff builds upon
prior SHARP testing in Portland and Seattle and upon preparatory work in Oakland to build a Learning
Collaborative (aim 1) composed of research institutions and community organizations in Seattle, Portland,
and Oakland. The SHARP Learning Collaborative seeks to understand needed environmental adaptations,
cultural preferences, and recruitment and retention strategies to better suit the SHARP approach to each
community. This will be accomplished by each site hosting a Community Engagement Studio with 12
community members. These consultative group sessions also provide information about salient points of
interest to guide the development of 24 new routes and reminiscence content for Portland and Seattle, and 14
new routes for Oakland. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the SHARP approach in each city (aim
2), 12 healthy and mildly cognitively impaired older Black adults will test the SHARP approach, including
adaptations, routes, and reminiscence content and their mode of delivery - the SHARP walking application.
Testing will occur over a continuous period of 12 weeks in Portland and Seattle, and 8 weeks in Oakland.
Through surveys and focus groups, participants will provide feedback on components of the SHARP approach
and on the overall walking experience, as well as on the pre/post health measures administered (related to
cognition, depression, and anxiety). Finally, we will assess fidelity to the intervention across the three
cities (aims 3) via video and audio recording of intervention components and using a participant fidelity
survey. Training in reminiscence therapy, cognitive and social measures, and dissemination and
implementation science, and coupled with on-the-ground lessons learned from the SHARP Learning
Collaborative as they test SHARP in three cities will culminate in the development of a comprehensive SHARP
protocol and fidelity checklist. These two K01 products will facilitate the scalability of SHARP to these cities
and beyond, and will contribute significantly to the conceptualization and development of a subsequent
multisite R01 application to test the efficacy of SHARP on improving cognition and wellbeing."
10949898,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Less than 50% of adolescents with a mental illness receive care, resulting in enduring negative effects on health.
Moreover, mental health burden is growing especially for racial/ethnic minority and lower socioeconomic youth.
This unmet mental health treatment need persists after accounting for symptom severity and insurance/economic
factors, suggesting there are other barriers to mental health care. Stigma, while preventable, has a moderate
negative effect on help-seeking attitudes and behaviors that influence participation in mental health services. As
effective treatments are available, addressing stigma early and head-on is a public health priority to narrow
treatment gaps for youth. For youth, education-based anti-stigma interventions are efficacious to reduce stigma
and promote help-seeking. Importantly, education-based anti-stigma interventions also eliminate race/ethnic and
gender stigma disparities, thereby helping to address mental health disparities. Yet these efficacious anti-stigma
interventions for youth are rarely integrated in typical mental health education. Given this, this project’s central
goal is to generate new knowledge regarding implementation of anti-stigma research evidence in natural school
settings by targeting principals and health educators and using digital technology to foster innovation in school
health education. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide critical knowledge and
resources to help Dr. DuPont become an independent, interdisciplinary investigator conducting theory-driven
implementation science that links the state-of-the-art in anti-stigma efficacy trials with mental health education.
The project includes a rigorous evaluation of existing school mental health curricula using archival datasets and
literature, an analysis of integrated qualitative–quantitative data from principals and health educators, and a pilot
type III hybrid implementation trial using adaptive randomization, digital dissemination, and school leadership
support strategies. These studies will identify viable strategies for supporting principals and educators in the real-
world to adopt efficacious anti-stigma curricula. Currently few scientists exist who can inform strategic decision-
making and resource allocation regarding the provision of efficacious anti-stigma education. Upon completion of
the proposed activities, Dr. DuPont will have a unique combination of knowledge and skills in 1) implementation
science focused on school change; 2) qualitative and mixed-methods research; 3) use of digital technology to
advance health education; 4) creating sustainable academic–community partnerships; and 5) grant writing, data
collection, and dissemination of results. The proposed research uniquely integrates methods across disciplines,
using experimental design, adaptive randomization in natural school settings, and digital technology to yield vital
generalizable information concerning real-world implementation of efficacious anti-stigma curricula. The
research plan also elicits voices from schools to increase the likelihood of successful future interventions,
promote school empowerment and engagement, focus on high-priority populations and settings, foster a
promising collaborative framework for future school-based research, and lay a foundation for a future R01 grant."
10949739,"ABSTRACT:
Breast cancer in Uganda presents a pressing public health challenge, characterized by late-stage
diagnoses and high mortality rates, particularly among women residing in rural and semi-urban areas. This
proposal addresses this critical issue by optimizing, validating, and deploying a point-of-care diagnostic kit,
tailored for primary care clinics in Uganda, where most women access care. The proposed diagnostic kit
combines (1) an FDA-cleared automated AI-enabled whole breast ultrasound and (2) a smartphone-
enabled AI-powered device that performs brightfield imaging of basic cytology preparations and
incorporates a self-contained immunodiagnostic chip to quantify breast tumor biomarkers. Our approach
involves a two-fold validation strategy. First, we will validate the diagnostic performance of the proposed
diagnostic kit in a U.S. clinical setting, comparing it to standard-of-care methods such as ultrasound,
mammography, tissue sampling, and pathology (aim 1). Utilizing quality improvement cycles and feedback
from end-users, we will refine the kit's performance and usability. Next, we will validate the kit at the
Uganda Cancer Institute, tailoring it to Uganda's healthcare landscape, considering factors like
infrastructure, health workers’ expertise, and accessibility (aim 2). Following validation, and guided by a
Ugandan Community Advisory Board, we will implement a cluster randomized controlled trial involving
eight community health centers (CHCs) across two health districts in Uganda (aim 3). A mobile breast
cancer detection clinic will deliver the diagnostic kit to CHCs during bi-monthly Breast Health Days for
N=1000 patients referred for diagnostic evaluation, at 4 CHCs. We will compare the effectiveness of the
diagnostic kit with women receiving care at control CHCs, who will be referred for standard-of-care
ultrasound at Regional Hospitals (N=1000). Our collaboration draws upon expertise in engineering and
biomedical device development, breast cancer research, and global health, positioning us to significantly
impact breast cancer outcomes in Uganda. This initiative aligns with the RFA-CA-24-005 mission to
develop cancer-relevant technologies suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries. By validating
and deploying a practical, cost-effective, and user-friendly detection and diagnostic technology, we aim to
empower healthcare providers in Uganda and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes. If successful, this
innovation stands to enhance access to timely breast cancer detection and diagnosis in resource-
constrained settings."
10949742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Socioeconomically disadvantaged young adults (SDYA) are at a disproportionately greater risk of tobacco-
related illness and disease compared to non-disadvantaged young adults in the U.S. Given that quitting smoking
before age 30 reduces almost all of the mortality associated with ever smoking, understanding predictors of
smoking cessation and relapse in SDYA who smoke is critical to preventing the escalation and continuation of
tobacco use in this high-risk group. SDYA who smoke and are transitioning into young adulthood are vulnerable
to experiencing a wide range of social-contextual stressors (e.g., financial stress), which can interfere with their
motivation to quit and cessation efforts. In line with NIDA’s strategic plans to understand “how social determinants
of health increase or decrease risk for addiction over the lifespan,” this MOSAIC K99/R00 grant application aims
to provide empirical evidence on the social-contextual predictors of smoking cessation in SDYA who smoke.
Social-contextual stressors may be dynamic in nature and vary daily or moment-to-moment. To understand how
day-to-day changes in social-contextual stressors affect smoking cessation in SDYA, we propose to combine:
a) qualitative interviews focused on the lived experiences of SDYA who smoke to better understand how specific
social-contextual stressors are experienced in daily life with b) EMA of these stressors in a real-time, naturalistic
environment. The specific aims of the K99 phase are to: 1) gain an in-depth understanding of how social-
contextual stressors impact smoking cessation and relapse among SDYA who smoke and attempt to quit
smoking in the natural environment; and 2) develop and evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of an EMA
protocol. To achieve these aims, a mixed methods approach (qualitative interviews with 30-40 SDYA ages 18-
25 who smoke and previously tried to quit; a pilot EMA study and exit interviews with 15 SDYA who smoke) will
be used to refine a protocol for a full EMA study. The R00 phase will include a larger-scale EMA study that will
assess the impact of social-contextual stressors on psychopharmacological mechanisms of smoking cessation
and relapse experienced at the event-level in 100 SDYA who smoke and are willing to make a serious quit
attempt in the next 30 days. The PI, Dr. Mariel Bello, will work with an exceptional team of mentors (Drs. Rachel
Cassidy, Suzanne Colby, Jennifer Merrill, Tim Janssen, and Andrea Villanti) to develop expertise in five areas
of training: 1) mixed methods research (qualitative + EMA); 2) EMA methodology; 3) intensive longitudinal data
analysis; 4) community-engaged research approaches; and 5) professional development skills. Successful
completion of the research and training objectives detailed in this proposal will prepare Dr. Mariel Bello for a
successful transition to independent faculty researcher, as well as further develop her program of research
focused on investigating the etiology and underlying mechanisms of tobacco-related health disparities among
marginalized groups. Findings will provide initial evidence on how event-level characteristics lead to smoking
relapse in SDYA, which will serve as preliminary data for future R01 applications.

10892180,"TL1 ABSTRACT: 
We propose an integrated, city-wide Network for KUH research training (TL1 Training Core) for pre- and postdoctoral trainees doing original KUH research under the mentorship of experienced, scientifically diverse 
preceptors. We will create a vibrant, supportive and dynamic training environment to encourage trainees to 
investigate key KUH related questions affecting human health and disease. This U2C-TL1 training mechanism 
will connect the abundant and diverse clinical, translational, and basic science resources available in the Atlanta 
scientific community, creating a cohesive program promoting collaborative, supportive, interdisciplinary 
research. The “Atlanta Network Training In KUH Scientific Research (ATLANTIS Program)” will promote 
kidney, urologic, and hematologic research training for pre- and postdoctoral trainees at Emory University, 
Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech), and Morehouse School of Medicine. Each provides unique training 
opportunities and complementary scientific strengths. We will recruit a talented pool of young scholars both 
locally and nationwide, including women and members of underrepresented minorities. To recruit outstanding 
trainees, the Network and TL1 Cores will work together to promote KUH research and ATLANTIS training among 
undergraduates, particularly at HBCUs, graduate students and postdoc trainees. Through required and elective 
coursework, ATLANTIS will provide predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars with the core competencies and skills 
they need to achieve their specific goals and to succeed in a KUH research-intensive career. We will provide 
mentored training in essential and innovative research techniques, data analysis, scientific writing, and oral 
presentations. Trainees will meet with their mentor and Program Leadership at regular intervals to review their 
accomplishments and goals, as well as to identify future opportunities. Mentors will discuss the scholar’s 
challenges and guide them in finding solutions to these roadblocks. We will continually evaluate and improve the 
program based on trainee and mentor feedback. The program’s success and areas for improvement will also be 
identified based on an annual review of current and former trainee accomplishments, such as published 
manuscripts, grants and patents, positions and promotions obtained, and honors received. Thus, the goals of 
the ATLANTIS TL1 are to: 1) develop a network bringing together TL1 and other KUH trainees and mentors for 
direct peer-to-peer communication, collaboration, and proactive engagement, 2) develop an integrated city-wide 
institutional network for KUH research training and recruitment, 3) engage undergraduates, especially from 
Atlanta HBCUs, and 4) develop an integrated professional development program that enhances trainee and 
preceptor development. To achieve these goals, we will develop a broad mentor and leadership scientific training 
base from KUH-related programs across Atlanta institutions."

This TL1 application responds to a critical need to train predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in skills, 
methods, and competencies of clinical and translational research and to provide mentored research 
experiences. The TL1 training program within OCTRI is distinguished by: a strong and diverse pool of trainees 
who represent the full range of translation and disciplines, an emphasis on team science that is at the core of 
all activities, and individual development of the competencies of clinical and translational research. 
Both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are included in this application. The program described herein is

(UGA). The TL1 Core is closely linked with the Institutional Career Development Core (KL2 Core) and 
governed by a joint KL2-TL1 Research Education Executive Committee. The TL1 Core provides didactic and 
mentored clinical and translational research (CTR) training to Georgia CTSA-supported predoctoral and 
postdoctoral trainees with the overarching goal of equipping them with the scientific skills, tools and methods to
enhance the translation of their discoveries to improve human health. The TL1 Core in collaboration with the 
KL2 Core support two successful CTR didactic and mentored training programs: the Master of Science in 
Clinical Research (MSCR) degree program, and the Certificate Program in Translational Research (CPTR).
Since the formation of our CTSA in 2007, there has been 116 long-term TL1 trainees, including the 14
incoming TL1 trainees in July 2021; 65% are women, 48% are non-White and 21% are underrepresented
minorities (URM). TL1 trainees remain highly engaged in CTR, (94% of 103 former TL1 trainees since 2007
have remain engaged in CTR careers, including 84 in academia, 7 in industry, 5 in the federal government
[CDC, NIH]), and 1 in non-university CTR. Since the establishment of Georgia CTSA in 2017 as a large CTSA,
we have had a major expansion of the TL1 Core with the addition of TL1 postdoctoral trainees to a program
that that had previously supported predoctoral trainees. Since 2017, we have had 66 TL1-appointed trainees
and an additional 63 pre- and postdoctoral trainees from the partner institutions supported by T32 grants or
through institutional support who have received CTR training in the Georgia CTSA-supported MSCR or CPTR

 A Virtual Reality (VR) Interven�on for Stress, Resilience, and Blood Pressure Management in Black Women
Background: Black women have a higher rate (approximately 60%) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers (e.g.,
hypertension) compared to their white female counterparts aged 20 and older (45.4%). Addi�onally, Black women are
more likely to suﬀer from insuﬃcient sleep (less than 6 hours), increasing their CVD risks. Stressors, especially complex
and cumula�ve intersec�onal stressors (such as economic strain, caregiver burden, racial stress, and gender
discrimina�on) experienced by Black women, are upstream determinants of hypertension and insuﬃcient sleep. To cope
with intersec�onal stress, Black women have developed unique forms of resilience. Current psychological and mental
health treatments do not speciﬁcally address intersec�onal stress. Therefore, to address the intersec�onal distress
experienced by Black women, we need behavioral treatments that can provide therapeu�c relief when needed. Innova�on
and Approach: Realist Women Study aims to pilot test the eﬀec�veness of a culturally tailored VR-exposure stress
management program in addressing intersec�onal stress and improving cardiovascular health in Black women. This K01
study aims to conduct focus group and individual interviews with 16 Black women to develop a community-deﬁned
concept of resilience. Addi�onally, the study will assess stress, sleep health, and feedback on using virtual reality (VR) for
stress management. It will also explore barriers and mi�ga�on strategies related to immersive technology usage among
Black women dealing with the superwoman schema coping (SSC). The Study is a pilot randomized clinical trial with (RCT)
a total of 60 par�cipants, focusing on hypertensive Black women. The hypothesis is that par�cipants in the stress
management virtual reality (VR-SM) group (n=30) will experience reduced stress (a minimum 12-point reduc�on in
cumula�ve intersec�onal stress scores), an increase of at least 0.77 points in CD-RISC scores, more days of suﬃcient sleep
(at least 7), a signiﬁcant decrease in blood pressure (BP), and adherence to the VR-SM program (using at least 50% of the
total modules). This research seeks to address a cri�cal gap in the literature by exploring the feasibility and impact of VR-
based interven�ons in this underserved popula�on. Relevance: The Study aims to reduce morbidity and mortality
associated with hypertension and insuﬃcient sleep in Black women by providing an innova�ve and accessible VR-based
interven�on tailored to their unique needs. This research represents a crucial step in addressing health dispari�es and
improving cardiovascular outcomes in this high-risk demographic. This K01 award will provide pilot data for an R01-level
RCT to develop a VR-delivered, culturally tailored Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduc�on (MBSR) program to enhance
resilience to cumula�ve intersec�onal stress and BP management for Black women. It will also further the candidate’s
training in psychological trauma research and biobehavioral medicine, equipping her with new skills in prac�ce-based
clinical trials, digital health interven�ons, ac�graphy, ecological momentary assessments, and advanced research design
and analysis. These skills will ensure her success as an independent inves�gator focused on inves�ga�ng and addressing
unique stress responses among minori�zed popula�ons while examining the eﬀects and mechanisms of scalable digital
health solu�ons for Black women experiencing elevated stress levels, poor sleep, cardiovascular health issues, and

Specifically, treating the Philadelphia {Ph) chromosome subgroup (which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL) of B-cell ALL challenging and has high relapse rates and poor survival. Mounting evidence from recent findings suggest that Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription S {STATS) signaling is a promising therapeutic targE for treating high-risk B-cell ALL. One-way STATS5 signaling can be efficiently targeted is by utilizing STAT5 siRNA, which can precisely knock down the STATS gene and inhibit the proliferation of B-cell ALL cells. C the other hand, a small molecule ligand, NL-1, which interacts with mitochondrial protein, MitoNEET he demonstrated its anti-leukemic activity in B-cell ALL. We hypothesize that a combinatorial treatment strategy that simultaneously targets STATS and MITONEET using STATS siRNA and NL-1, respective! may show enhanced anti-leukemic activity. STATS siRNA is a negatively charged hydrophilic nucleic ac with poor in vivo stability, and NL-1 is insoluble in aqueous solvents. These challenges necessitate significant need to develop a suitable delivery system that can encapsulate and deliver both of these therapeutics precisely to cells. Our preliminary data show that utilizing an ionizable lipid nanoparticle approach not only efficiently encapsulates nucleic acids and small molecules therapeutics but als intracellularly delivers them to B-cell ALL cells in vitro. Two independent aims are proposed to optimize and validate ionizable lipid nanoparticles as an intracellular delivery platform for B-cell ALL treatment. Aim 1: To develop ionizable lipid nanoparticles containing STATS siRNA and NL-1 and optimize their intracellular, release kinetics. Aim 2: Determine if STATS siRNA-NL-1 ionizable lipid nanoparticles will allow du intracellular targeting, leading to enhanced anti-leukemic activity. This application is innovative in multiple ways, including the development of translatable lipid nanoparticle platforms, the dual intracellular delive1 of nucleic acid and small molecule therapeutics, and the testing of ionizable lipid nanoparticle technology B-cell ALL models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first strategy that utilizes ionizable lip nanoparticles to target B-cell ALL. We expect that once this application is complete, we will have identified the suitable ionizable lipid nanoparticle platform that induces the dual intracellular release of nucleic acid and small molecule therapeutics. Furthermore, we will have determined if combinatorial targeting is optimal, for reducing tumor burden in B-cell ALL."
10949402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major challenge in bacterial pathogenesis is the prevention and treatment of polymicrobial diseases, as
microbe-microbe interactions alter the initiation of disease and its susceptibility to antimicrobial treatment. For
example, bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs within the vaginal microbial community, and the factors that drive its
initiation, treatment, and high levels of recurrence (>50%) are not understood. BV is the most common condition
of the female genital tract in reproductive-aged women, impacting over 29% of women in the United States with
an estimated annual economic burden of $5 billion in North America. Importantly, in addition to vaginal pain,
odor, and discharge, BV causes increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and is
associated with preterm birth and cervical cancer. Research has sought to understand BV pathogenesis through
studying differences in community composition at the species, genus, and phylum levels and through identifying
genomic and phenotypic differences across BV microbes. However, this previous work only partially explains
differences across women in the development of BV and the response to treatment. This proposal investigates
single-cell genomic and transcriptomic diversity as two underexplored areas that will transform our understanding
of the underlying factors that control BV progression. The goal of this proposal is to identify aspects of diversity
that impact BV and provide insights into new strategies for prevention, treatment, and diagnosis. Further, these
findings will have broad applicability to polymicrobial infections. In this study, the overarching hypothesis is that
intrapersonal strain-level genomic diversity and transcriptomic heterogeneity alter the stability of communities,
their interactions with the host, and their susceptibility to treatment. First, this proposal tests the importance of
intrapersonal strain-level diversity in pre-clinical models and clinical specimens (Objective 1). Across microbiome
sites and polymicrobial infections, including in the vaginal microbiome, previous work has identified that
individuals can concurrently harbor multiple strains of the same species, but the functional implications of this
diversity in disease is unknown. This objective will demonstrate how variation in intrapersonal strain-level
diversity impacts bacterial physiology and BV progression. Second, this proposal will characterize the role of
single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity in microbial interactions related to BV and responses to antimicrobials
through applying the new approach, bacterial single-cell RNA-seq, to in vitro vaginal communities and clinical
specimens (Objective 2). This innovative analysis will result in the identification of transcriptomic subpopulations
with altered traits, including pathogenesis and antimicrobial susceptibility, that can be targeted to promote vaginal
health. Overall, this proposed work will have broad implications in our understanding of the drivers of BV and
polymicrobial infections, suggesting novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of diseases."

Summary: Maternal morbidity and mortality are at an all-time high in Texas, particularly among Latina women.
One major contributor to this public health crisis is under-treated mental health conditions. The purpose of this
Career Development Award is to provide Dr. Petruzzi with the training, career development, and mentorship
necessary to improve maternal mental health outcomes among Latina women through a culturally-adapted,
intervention that simultaneously addresses mental health and social needs. Candidate: Dr. Petruzzi is a health
equity researcher and a research associate in the Division of Community Engagement and Health Equity at the
Department of Population Health of Dell Medical School. She is a clinical social worker and has over a decade
of research experience in hospital and healthcare settings. While she has expertise in mental health and social
needs, her career will be propelled by acquisition of skills in intervention development, cultural adaptation, and
clinical trial design. Mentorship: Mentors are nationally recognized investigators with complementary
expertise: Dr. Carmen Valdez (Latina maternal mental health), Dr. Deborah Parra-Medina (intervention
development and cultural adaptation) and Dr. Emily Miller (perinatal mental health and clinical trials). Several
advisors will support this proposal, including an expert in problem solving therapy (Dr. Sampson), an expert in
perinatal patient navigation (Dr. Yee) and a biostatistician (Dr. Hobbs). Training: Dr. Petruzzi will receive both
didactic and experiential training in community intervention development, cultural adaptation, and hybrid
effectiveness implementation clinical trial design through coursework, workshops, meetings with mentors and
advisors, conferences, and manuscript writing. Research: Maternal mortality is at an all-time high in Texas,
particularly among Latina women. Mental health risk factors such as depression and suicidality have been
identified as the leading cause of maternal mortality. Evidence based interventions such as patient navigation
and problem-solving therapy have been developed to improve maternal health outcomes among racial and
ethnic minorities. However, few interventions address both mental health and social needs, and even fewer are
culturally or linguistically adapted, which could improve feasibility and acceptability among Latina women. This
proposal is innovative in combining two evidence-based interventions (problem-solving therapy and patient
navigation) to improve perinatal mental health among Latinas. The specific aims are: 1) conduct a community
assessment to identify the culturally relevant mental health and social needs of pregnant/postpartum Latina
women in Central Texas; 2) combine, culturally and linguistically adapt two evidence-based interventions
(problem-solving therapy and patient navigation) for pregnant Latina women to simultaneously address mental
health and social needs; and 3) conduct a feasibility study to assess acceptability and feasibility of the
intervention. Preliminary data from the feasibility study will inform a R01 hybrid effectiveness implementation
clinical trial to generate the necessary evidence to improve rates of maternal mortality among Latina women."
10951093,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Socioemotional impairments are core features of behavioral variant of Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD) and
account for the majority of disease related morbidity. bvFTD patients also demonstrate autonomic impairments
and these likely account for several socioemotional deficits in this condition. However, efforts to characterize
autonomic dysfunction in bvFTD patients remain sparse, and the reliability of such measures remains
undetermined. The characterization of autonomic dysfunction in bvFTD would be greatly advanced by novel
technologies that measure autonomic function more consistently and in patients’ home environments. Such
technologies include wearable garments and smartwatches capable of serially recording heart-rate variability,
electrodermal activity, pupil reactivity and others. This proposal will first assess the test-retest reliability of
“gold-standard” measurements of autonomic function in 30 bvFTD patients and in 30 matched controls in a
controlled laboratory setting. This will establish that bvFTD patients have detectable and stable autonomic
impairments when compared to controls. It will then assess the test-retest reliability of ambulatory wearable
technologies in the same laboratory environment in both groups and will correlate gold-standard and
ambulatory metrics to establish the validity of the ambulatory measures. Next, it will assess the feasibility of
using ambulatory autonomic assessments in both subject groups at home. Finally, it will correlate gold-
standard and ambulatory autonomic measurements to validated ratings of socioemotional function. This work
will germinate studies establishing autonomic metrics as predictive biomarkers of socioemotional dysfunction in
bvFTD. It will also vastly advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of autonomic dysfunction and
socioemotional impairment in bvFTD."
10951059,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While tobacco smoking has declined dramatically among adolescents and is now almost rare, the prevalence
of electronic nicotine delivery device (ENDS, nicotine vaping) use has risen rapidly, fueled by social media
promotion, innovative product engineering, and advertising, and effectively reversing five decades of progress
in youth tobacco control. The increase in high school vaping from 2017-18 was the largest one-year increase in
any substance used over the 44 years that Monitoring the Future has tracked adolescent substance use. In
2019, 26% of U.S. high school seniors reported past month vaping, a 5% increase from 2018, with the
sharpest inflection in vaping initiation at around age 16. Most youth who initiate ENDS use have never smoked
tobacco; however, nicotine vaping is associated with subsequent initiation of tobacco smoking. This is of high
public health importance because high school aged adolescents are in the developmental period with the
highest lifetime vulnerability for drug use to progress to entrenched addictive patterns. Thus ENDS use puts
adolescents at high risk for nicotine addiction, escalation to entrenched combusted tobacco, multiple tobacco
product, and other drug addiction, in addition to negative health effects of vapor exposure. Recent surveys
indicate that over half of adolescents who vape nicotine want to quit, but there are no known effective
treatments to aid the millions of U.S. adolescents who have begun to vape nicotine to quit. There is growing
consensus that effective interventions are needed for adolescents with pre-addiction, operationalized as mild to
moderate substance use disorder, with the rationale that early interventions could prevent escalation to often
lifelong patterns of drug use. Thus, here we propose to enroll adolescents with at least once weekly vaping in
the past month, whose mild severity of use would exclude them from most cessation clinical trials. Because
vaping has become so prevalent in high schools at a time of unprecedented behavioral health workforce
shortage, effective interventions that are scalable into school and community settings are needed. We
designed QuitVaping to be a fully remote, digital and behavioral intervention, grounded in Cognitive Behavioral,
Social Cognitive and Dissonance Theory to be developmentally appropriate for mid and late adolescent
tobacco vaping cessation. QuitVaping is delivered over twelve 20-minute sessions by young adult lay
counselors. QuitVaping has high satisfaction ratings, retention, and abstinence rates in preliminary testing in
adolescents with established nicotine dependence. Here we propose to test QuitVaping to promote nicotine
vaping cessation in youth who vape as little as at least once a weekly, and thus are at risk for progression
along the spectrum of addictive disorders, with no, mild or moderate dependence on vaped nicotine, thus
meeting criteria for pre-addiction. To maximize generalizability, the trial will have few exclusion criteria for
subsyndromal psychiatric and substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms but will exclude and refer for clinical
care those with any severe SUD. To do so, we propose to enroll 300 adolescents, ages 14-18, from high
school and community settings, who are willing to try to quit vaping, into a double-blind, parallel group, intent-
to-treat trial of the effect of QuitVaping vs Enhanced Usual Care (psychoeducation, advice to quit, and referral
to a free texting-based support, This is Quitting (TIQ)) on abstinence from ENDS, other tobacco use, and other
drug use at the end of 12 weeks of treatment and 6-month follow up. Adherence and retention, well-
documented challenges in adolescent smoking cessation trials, will be incentivized and supported with the
innovative Emocha smartphone application that will deliver session reminders and collect daily vaping data.
This proposal is innovative and responsive to urgent and growing requests for tobacco vaping cessation
treatments from adolescents, their families, and schools. Positive results will define an effective, affordable,
scalable intervention that can be deployed in homes, schools, and clinical settings to combat the rapidly
resurgent epidemic of youth tobacco use."
10951113,"Project Summary/Abstract
The numerous functions of the brain are carried out by circuits that are very precisely wired. Within a brain
region, there can be hundreds of distinct cell types, but a specific pathway may only innervate some cell types
and not others. These synaptic connectivity patterns are largely established during development by the
interactions of diverse pre- and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expressed by each cell type.
Large-scale transcriptomic atlasing methods have now described thousands of cell types, with hundreds of
CAM genes expressed throughout the brain. Consequently, uncovering the CAMs essential for establishing
cell type-specific connections onto neuronal populations has proved incredibly challenging. Tackling this
research area requires two key methodological advancements. First, it necessitates the development of a
high-throughput method for mapping connectivity across transcriptomically defined cell types. I recently
developed such an approach by leveraging all-optical tools for scalable synaptic mapping (SynMap) across a
diverse neuronal population. With SynMap, I can measure postsynaptic responses of < 0.25 mV across
hundreds of cells per experiment, and determine the identity of each cell using spatial transcriptomic methods.
But understanding how these circuits are constructed now requires the development of a second technology
for screening the functional roles of many molecules across diverse populations of cells in intact tissue. To this
end, in the K99 phase of this proposal I will demonstrate in vivo Perturb-FISH, a method for performing and
characterizing stochastic CRISPR-based genetic perturbations across distinct cell types in the brain using
spatial transcriptomics. In the independent R00 phase of this work, I will combine Perturb-FISH and SynMap to
determine which CAMs are essential for establishing cell type-specific synaptic connections between the motor
thalamus and the motor cortex– a pathway in which cell-type specific wiring is thought to be crucial for circuit
function. The general connectivity principles that I uncover as part of this study will greatly advance our
understanding of the molecular basis of cell type-specific wiring throughout the brain. To achieve these goals, I
will utilize the many resources available to me at Boston University, the guidance of my mentor and co-mentor,
Drs. Michael Economo and Brian Cleary, and the expert Advisory Committee that I have assembled to provide
career and scientific support. Along with the resources and network provided by the BRAIN Initiative, this
training plan will enable me to enhance diversity in the neuroscience community, and will position me for a
successful career as a role model, a mentor, and an independent scientist."
10951348,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The development of successful vaccines is a significant achievement in public health. However, vaccines
exhibit varying efficacy across different individuals and populations. Vulnerable groups such as infants, the
elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those in low- and middle-income countries often experience
suboptimal vaccine responses. Research suggests that the gut microbiota, the community of microorganisms in
the digestive tract, plays a crucial role in shaping immune responses to vaccines. The composition of the gut
microbiota varies significantly among individuals, and its diversity and stability tend to decrease in infancy and
with age, correlating with reduced vaccine responsiveness. This has led to a growing interest in exploring cost-
effective microbiota-targeted interventions to enhance vaccine effectiveness, especially in at-risk populations.
However, the precise mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences host immunity, particularly B cell
responses, remain poorly understood, posing a significant barrier to unlocking the therapeutic potential of the
microbiota. Recent research has highlighted the role of stromal cells as key mediators in initiating, sustaining,
and concluding B-cell responses. My prior study found that distinctions in intestinal microbiota composition have
been observed to affect immune responses by mediating stromal cells' function, underscoring the ability of
stromal cells to detect microbiota differences and orchestrate immune responses accordingly. Building upon
these insights, I hypothesize that stromal cells play a pivotal role in sensing microbiota differences and
establishing the appropriate immune environment for B-cell development. To test this hypothesis and
uncover the molecular mechanisms involved, this proposed project will leverage the microbiota-stromal cell axis
to identify bacterial strains or molecules that enhance stromal cell function to promote B-cell responses and
antibody production following vaccination. This research will employ a well-established gnotobiotic mouse model
in which germ-free mice are colonized with human-derived microbiota that transmit the high or low
responsiveness to oral cholera vaccines (OCV) of their donors. Through a combination of novel animal models,
stromal cell–specific culture systems, microbiota analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and proteomics, we will
1) Identify the gut stromal cell populations that fail to produce essential immune factors for B-cell development
and antibody production 2) Identify microbial components that are crucial for stromal cell development and
activation. The successful completion of this research will a) provide a proof-of-concept that the gut microbiota
can influence stromal cell activation, thereby affecting vaccine responses in both the gut and extraintestinal sites,
b) Lay the groundwork for the development of novel immunostimulatory microbial components that can
significantly enhance stromal cell function and vaccine responses, not only for OCV but also for other vaccines
and c) Provide a blueprint for the future development of microbiota-targeted stromal cell therapies for various
microbiota-related immune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer immunotherapy."
10951210,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
B cell memory generated by antigen exposure consists of antibodies and memory B cells (MBCs). The human
spleen is well recognized as a major MBC reservoir, but recent studies suggest that its role goes beyond MBC
storage. There is evidence that MBCs in the spleen receive signals that modify phenotype and function. In
addition, it has been proposed that the spleen serves as an archive of all MBC clones that disperse from sites of
formation via the blood. Our objective is to perform the first antigen-specific evaluation of the spleen as an
evolving MBC archive that represents an individual’s MBC response potential. We will use the influenza A virus
hemagglutinin (HA) as a model antigen, since most adults have a large pool of HA-reactive MBCs modified by
multiple exposures to variant HA strains and often retaining an imprint of early-life infection. We will test
hypotheses about the composition a splenic HA-reactive MBC archive based on our current strong
understanding of HA-specific B cell responses and MBC formation in humans. Experiments will be performed
using a large collection of stored splenocytes from surgically removed trauma spleens.
Under Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the size of splenic MBC populations reactive to HA strains and to
the conserved HA stalk domain reflect early-life imprinting. The size of MBC populations will be determined by
in vitro stimulation of splenic MBCs and measurement of secreted HA-reactive antibodies by multiplex binding
assay. Association of HA reactivity with phenotypic MBC subsets will be analyzed by flow cytometry using 29
surface markers and a set of HA probes. Under Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that an evolving splenic archive
mostly contains large numbers of MBCs that are broadly HA cross-reactive. Individual HA+ MBCs will be index
sorted and stimulated to induce antibody-secreting cell formation. Clonal antibodies in culture supernatants will
be analyzed to determine HA reactivity and affinity. To evaluate the completeness of the splenic archive, Aim 3
studies will test the hypothesis that the archive contains families of clonally-related MBCs with ranges of somatic
hypermutation and reactivities to HA strains recognized only in early life, chronological ranges of HAs that
frequently include early HAs, and sets of contemporary HAs. Splenocyte samples shown under Aim 2 to contain
MBCs with an early-life HA imprinting signature will be selected for multivariate single cell analysis.
Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene sequencing, calculation of mutation frequencies, and evolutionary
tree analysis of clonal clusters will be performed and correlated with HA reactivity profiles.
We expect our investigation of the spleen as an archive of HA-reactive MBCs to extend our understanding of the
spleen as a key determinant of an individual’s MBC-mediated immunity. This information is essential for a full
appreciation of the potential consequences of splenectomy, disease states associated with hyposplenism, B cell
depletion therapies, and splenic changes associated with infections."

On July 6th, 2023, the FDA approved Lecanemab-IRMB, the first drug with evidence of slowing the rate of
cognitive decline through a reduction in amyloid plaques, the protein that accumulates in the brains of people
with Alzheimer’s disease. Like all major medical treatments, there are trade-offs and alternatives that should be
considered. First, the improvements in clinical symptoms are minimal. For example, Lecanemab-IRMB only
demonstrated a 0.45 improvement on an 18 point scale at 18 months despite drastic improvements on imaging
evidence of Amyloid. Clinically, this therapy is going to be challenging to discuss with patients. If this is like
other high-cost therapies with a common indication, patients and families will likely see direct-to-consumer
information and will approach clinicians hoping to receive this therapy. Situations such as this are ripe for
standardized information such as a patient decision aid (DA) to help clinicians communicate effectively and
accurately about the benefits and burdens and help patients and families make a well-informed decision.
Shared decision making supported by patient DAs is an evidence-based strategy to improve decision making.
A DA regarding dementia care could facilitate higher quality discussions to assure that patients wanting this
therapy are fully informed regarding the potential benefits and harms. Using an iterative, user-centered
approach with multilevel partner input, we will conduct a needs assessment among patients and clinicians
while simultaneously developing and piloting a DA to support SDM for pharmacologic drugs for dementia.
The project aims include:
Aim 1 (year 1): Among a sample of eligible patients, caregivers, and clinicians, we will:
 Aim 1a: Conduct a qualitative decision needs assessment of pharmacologic therapies for dementia.
 Aim 1b: Simultaneously develop a DA based on international standards and user-centered design.
Aim 2 (year 2): Using a pilot trial of 20 patients and their clinicians considering pharmacologic therapy
for dementia, we will:
 Aim 2a: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a dementia DA among a diverse population of older
 adults and their clinicians using a mixed-methods approach.
 Aim 2b: Determine the preliminary efficacy of the dementia DA on knowledge, decision conflict, satisfaction
 with decision, shared decision making, and care concordant with patient preferences.
We aim to make sure that patients’ and families’ expectations are aligned with the expected benefits and that
they are fully aware of the potential costs and harms of the new therapies for Dementia"

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with lupus nephritis
(LN). Moreover, LN patients of Black race face even higher ASCVD risk. Less than 15% of eligible LN patients
receive ASCVD prevention. This is because clinicians and patients need to know: a) who is at risk and will benefit
most from ASCVD prevention; b) how to start and tailor therapies per each patient’s risk; and c) what is the
efficacy and safety of ASCVD therapies during pregnancy—fears of young women that lead to stopping such
therapies. This proposal is designed to provide Dr. Shivani Garg, MD, MS with the training needed to become
an independent physician scientist researching interventions to improve ASCVD prevention in LN.
The goal of the proposed research is to develop effective ASCVD preventive interventions that support clinicians
and patients in decision-making and support use of ASCVD-risk reducing therapies to improve outcomes and
survival in LN. Garg’s earlier innovative work identified that subclinical renal arteriosclerosis in kidneys at LN
diagnosis is a window into the heart. This approach can identify patients who will benefit from ASCVD prevention
at LN diagnosis. To answer the two remaining questions/concerns of patients and clinicians, Garg’s project will:
a) Develop an implementation guide for clinicians to support decisions to 1) tailor ASCVD prevention by each
 patient’s risk; and 2) start ASCVD-risk reducing therapies based on evidence for effectiveness and safety
 (Aim 1). Using a validated method that combines scientific evidence from literature and expert consensus this
 guide will be developed. A retrospective performance testing will be done to test its public health impact.
b) Create a shared decision-making tool to support patients and clinicians in decision-making and identifying the
 best aligned approach to their personalized ASCVD preventive care (Aim 2). This tool will be informed by
 feedback from multidisciplinary experts, clinicians, and patients of diverse backgrounds to ensure biases and
 difficult concepts are addressed thereby delivering a racially, culturally, and socially appropriate tool.
c) Test the guide and shared decision-making tool in clinics to evaluate if patients and clinicians will adopt, use,
 and recommend the tools (Aim 3). Additionally, this step will inform the real-world impact and feasibility of
 using such interventions in busy clinics.
The data from this project, along with the novel correlations with subclinical renal arteriosclerosis, offer a
foundation for a multi-site R01 study to test the effectiveness of ASCVD preventive interventions in reducing the
risk of ASCVD in LN. Dr. Garg is in an ideal environment to complete this research and receive mentored training
in implementation and decision science, qualitative methods, health equity, and clinical trials. This proposal
addresses a significant clinical dilemma and serious gaps in ASCVD prevention research in LN and offers critical
support for her growth to lead ASCVD prevention research to improve outcomes and equity in LN."

Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) has been effective against certain blood cancers but has had limited
success against solid tumors, such as pancreatic cancers, largely because ACT T cells become
dysfunctional within the tumor-microenvironment (TME). There is a big knowledge gap on the
causes of dysfunction in ACT T cells, mainly because there are so many T-cell-intrinsic regulators
and T-cell-extrinsic TME suppressive factors that can all potentially contribute to ACT T cell
dysfunction. With the ultimate, goal of overcoming T cell dysfunction and improving therapeutic
efficacy, I seek a more comprehensive understanding of how ACT T cells are molecularly
programmed by intrinsic epigenetic regulators to become dysfunctional, and how extrinsic TME
factors further suppress the function of ACT T cells using ACT-treated mouse models and data
from ACT-treated pancreatic cancer patients. Specifically, using single-cell multi-omics (including
epigenomics) and spatial omics, along with the computational analysis and functional experiments,
I aim to: 1) Identify targetable T cell-intrinsic epigenetic regulator(s) of ACT T cell dysfunction in
TME, 2) Identify targetable intra-TME cellular & molecular interactions that suppress ACT T cell
function. My previous wet-lab & dry-lab training, and my extensive experience with the single-cell
analysis of both cancer and the immune cells, make me well-suited for the project. The project
can significantly clarify the fundamental biology of T cell dysfunction and reveal actionable clinical
strategies for improving ACT efficacy. The proposed computational frameworks should also be
broadly applicable to a wide spectrum of contexts. The benchmark datasets should also serve as
a rich, resource to the broad field of cancer immunotherapy for hypothesis generation and testing.
My long-term goal is to lead an independent research group at a top research university, using
systems biology to study quantitative questions in immuno-oncology, especially ACT against solid
tumors. Over the course of this award, I will be supported by primary mentor, Dr. Philip Greenberg,
a pioneer of ACT therapy for cancer, with a remarkable track record in science and mentoring. My
co-mentors, Drs. Henikoff, Newell, Gottardo, Setty, Chapuis, are all renowned experts of
epigenomics, single-cell and spatial omics, computational biology and clinical science,
respectively, providing complementary training for my independence transition. They will all assist
me in navigating the transition to an independent faculty position. Work will be conducted at Fred
Hutch Cancer Center, which offers all the state-of-the art facilities required for the successful of
the Aims in addition to a collegial scientific & training environment, and strong institutional support."

Maternal and child health is critical to achieving the Healthy People 2030 Goals. Investing in integrated 
nurturing care interventions from preconception through childhood and adolescence defines one’s 
developmental trajectory with benefits that accumulate across the life course and promote social justice (i.e., 
taking equity one step further by fixing the systems for generations to come). COVID-19 pandemic has 
disrupted essential nurturing care services such as prenatal, perinatal, and pediatric services. As a result, over 
a million preventable child and maternal deaths globally are projected to occur due to extreme poverty and 
household food insecurity (HFI; lack of consistent access to enough healthful food for an active, healthy life 
due to limited financial resources). Amid the COVID-19, HFI in the US tripled among households with children 
(~19.5%), disproportionately burdening marginalized low income and families of color. HFI is strongly linked 
with racial/ethnic inequities and adverse maternal-child health and nutrition outcomes. Integrating effective 
food security interventions within nurturing care services as a COVID-19 response & recovery efforts is an 
achievable strategy to promote equity. The West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood (WLVPN) is an 
intervention addressing social determinants of health to reduce structural racism amid COVID-19 in historically 
racial/ethnic marginalized communities in the Southwest US. The WLVPN is implemented by over 50 multi-sector partners in key life domains (health, education, employment, housing, and social justice) coordinated by 
Nevada Partners, Inc., with whom we have a solid and long-term collaboration. While WLVPN social 
intervention is a unique opportunity and platform to address endemic inequities in maternal-child mortality and 
food insecurity levels, it lacks focus on maternal-child health and nutrition. Therefore, our partnership with 
Nevada Partners, Inc. is well-placed for promoting the maternal-child component within WLVPN and advancing 
implementation and equity research. Our community-based participatory approach will use a racial equity 
framework to co-create WITH the community an intervention to integrate maternal-child health and nutrition 
consisted of a bundle of effective food security interventions retrieved from the literature (e.g., universal 
screening, community referral, monitoring system, and nutrition-focused counseling strategies) adapted and 
integrated into the nurturing care services within WLVPN communities. A Hybrid Type III quasi-experimental 
within-site will be designed to 1) develop and implement an equity-focused system-level intervention to 
integrate maternal-child health and nutrition and 2) assess the effectiveness of this intervention in decreasing 
levels of food insecurity and/or improve health outcomes of pregnant women and their young children under 
the age of 3, which will nurture their potentials, enabling them to thrive. This project is designed to inform how 
best multi-sectoral interventions (maternal-child health and food insecurity interventions) can be integrated to 
promote transformation on the maternal-child health and nutrition of historically marginalized communities."

The human cerebellum despite its small size relative to the cerebral cortex, contains nearly 80% of all neurons
in the brain. While it is classically associated with motor function, recent studies indicate a role for the human
cerebellum in higher cognitive functions such as speech, language and even satiety. Cerebellar disease,
including malformations and tumors, are common. Yet, our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of
cerebellar disease is poor. One reason for this could be our animal model-centric view of normal and abnormal
cerebellar development. We have identified several unique cerebellar developmental features in human that
are absent in commonly studied animal models, including rodents and non-human primates like the macaque.
These features include spatiotemporally expanded progenitor zones, like the rhombic lip that produces
cerebellar glutamatergic neurons and an expanded ventricular zone that produces GABAergic neurons. The
rhombic lip in humans is also long-lived and undergoes a series of morphological and cellular changes that are
yet to be identified in other animal species. The presence of human-specific features of normal human
cerebellar development partly explains why modeling cerebellar disease in animals has been a challenge. This
study aims to characterize the cellular features of these expanded progenitor zones in human using a battery
of in vitro assays, including live imaging microscopic protocols that measure the proliferative and migratory
characteristics of cells residing in these stem cell zones. We will also conduct rigorous single-cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of this progenitor zones to define the molecular pathways driving its
development. This study leverages our extensive expertise of cerebellar development in human and other
animal models, together with our unique access to fresh normal human fetal tissue obtained at the University
college London through the Human Developmental Biology Resource."
10951165,"Skeletal muscle regenerates following injury, with muscle stem cells (MuSCs) the source of new myofibers.
MuSCs are quiescent during homeostasis. Quiescence is an actively maintained state, supported by signals
from the MuSC niche. Upon muscle injury, MuSCs activate and enter the cell cycle, proliferate as myoblasts,
and differentiate and fuse to form new myofibers. How MuSCs maintain quiescence is not well understood, and
there is little known about the earliest events in the transition from quiescence to activation (the Q-A transition).
Quiescent MuSCs in vivo have long, heterogeneous cellular projections that rapidly retract in response to
muscle injury. Projections may therefore act as direct sensors of the niche environment. Projection retraction is
driven by a Rac-to-Rho GTPase activity switch that promotes downstream MuSC activation events. These
observations lead to several hypotheses: 1) MuSC projections are morphologically dynamic at quiescence,
providing a surveillance function for muscle damage; 2) MuSC dynamics during quiescence are regulated by
the relative balance of Rac and Rho activities promoted by niche-derived cues; and 3) there exist factors in
muscle tissue that signal to stimulate MuSC projection outgrowth and, consequently, promote MuSC
quiescence. Such factors are anticipated to be critical regulators of MuSC quiescence and the Q-A transition,
but their identities are unknown. Moreover, new approaches are required to screen for candidate factors. We
have developed an ex vivo live imaging assay for MuSCs within muscle bundles and used it to identify the
axonal chemoattractant, netrin-1, as a candidate niche-derived regulator of MuSC projection dynamics.
Multiple cell types in adult muscle express netrin-1, and MuSCs express the netrin-1 receptors, Neogenin
(Neo1) and Dcc. Furthermore, MuSCs extend projections in response to recombinant netrin-1, as visualized in
the ex vivo live imaging assay. It is proposed here to determine the role of netrin-1 signaling in MuSC
quiescence and the Q-A transition. We will use conditional genetic removal of netrin-1 receptors from MuSCs
to test directly the role of netrin-1 signaling in MuSC morphology, quiescence, and the Q-A transition. A
combination of in vivo and ex vivo techniques will be used, including tissue clearing, in vivo analyses of
uninjured and injured muscles, analysis of MuSCs on single myofibers; and live imaging of MuSCs within
muscle bundles. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide strong evidence that: 1) regulation of
MuSC projection dynamics is a key process in maintenance of quiescence; and 2) netrin-1 is the first member
of a new class of MuSC quiescence regulator. Such findings will validate the use of our new ex vivo live
imaging assay as a means to identify secreted signaling cues involved in this process."

Accelerated aging disorders can provide critical insights into aspects of physiological aging. A subset of
accelerated aging disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and mandibuloacral
dysplasia type B (MAD-B), are characterized by accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A or its variants. Normally,
farnesylated prelamin A is processed to mature lamin A – an intermediate filament protein of the nuclear lamina
– by a proteolytic cleavage near the carboxyl-terminus catalyzed by the zinc metalloproteinase ZMPSTE24.
Defects in this processing resulting from mutations in either LMNA encoding prelamin A or ZMPSTE24
respectively cause HGPS and MAD-B. Some studies have even implicated farnesylated prelamin A or its variants
in physiological aging. However, much remains to be learned about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of
how prelamin A mediates accelerated and possibly physiological aging. We have generated a mouse with a
point mutation that changes the leucine just downstream from the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site in prelamin A to an
arginine. LmnaL648R/L648R mice express permanently farnesylated prelamin A, with a single amino acid substitution
at residue 648, and no mature lamin A. However, in contrast to Zmpste24-/- mice that have severe progeroid
phenotypes and significantly shortened lifespans, LmnaL648R/L648R mice have more mild and later onset progeroid
features and near-normal longevity. This finding leads to two alterative hypotheses we will test in this R03 small
research project: 1) that ZMPSTE24 has functions related to accelerated aging independent of prelamin A
processing or 2) that a single amino acid substitution in prelamin A renders it less “toxic” than the wild-type
protein with regards to accelerated aging phenotypes. The single Specific Aim is to determine if deletion of
Zmpste24 shortens the lifespan and worsen the progeroid phenotypes of LmnaL648R/L648R mice. To test this
hypothesis, we will cross Lmna+/L648R and Zmpste24+/- mice to generate LmnaL648R/L648R;Zmpste24-/- mice. These
mice will express L648R prelamin A and have no active ZMPSTE24. If they are similar to Zmpste24-/- mice, with
a more severe progeroid phenotype and shorter lifespan than LmnaL648R/L648R mice, it will indicate that ZMPSTE24
has other critical functions in aging. If these “double mutant” mice have a longer lifespan and less severe
progeroid phenotypes than Zmpste24-/- mice, it will indicate that a single amino acid substitution in farnesylated
prelamin A reduces its ability to induce accelerated aging. Data that supports one of these alternative hypotheses
will lead to future projects on either 1) a role of ZMPSTE24 in accelerated aging separate from that of prelamin
A processing or 2) specific functions of the region around leucine 648 in prelamin A in generating accelerated
aging phenotypes."
10951216,"ABSTRACT
Chemical modifications in RNA play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in physiological and pathological
conditions. One underexplored aspect of this regulation comes from reactive oxidative species (ROS), which
modify nucleobases in RNA. Elevated levels of ROS and oxidative stress are prevalent in cancer cells, resulting
from metabolic reprogramming and driven by factors such as activated RAS expression. However, our
understanding of how ROS-induced RNA modifications affect gene expression in a cancer context remains
limited. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the roles and regulatory implications of oxidative
modifications of RNA, with a focus on KRAS-driven redox perturbations in non-small cell lung cancer cells. The
project has two main objectives. The first objective is to identify the patterns of oxidative modifications in RNA
induced by oncogenic KRAS. This will be achieved through the combination of next-generation sequencing
techniques and chemical methods to create high-resolution profiles of 8-oxoguanine modifications in RNA. The
second objective is to understand the molecular players that ‘read’ these modifications. This will be done through
biochemical and CLIP analysis techniques, focusing on proteins from the heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. By elucidating these interactions, the study aims to uncover potential
influences of oxidative RNA modifications on gene expression changes in cancer cells. The outcomes of this
study will significantly contribute to our fundamental understanding of gene regulation in cancer. Since oxidative
stress is a hallmark of many pathological states, the technological and conceptual advancements made in this
study will also have broader relevance in understanding the role of oxidative RNA modifications in the
pathogenesis of diseases."
10951367,"PROJECT/SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to assess a nanotherapeutic for the treatment of islet transplantation associated
instant-blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for patients
with type 1 diabetes and late-stage chronic pancreatitis. Isolated islets are infused into the patient’s liver in a
minimally invasive manner via the portal vein. The goal of this procedure is to restore normoglycemia.
Unfortunately, the IBMIR occurs when the islets contact blood and activate oxidative, inflammatory, and
coagulation pathways. The cumulative oxidative thrombo-inflammatory stress causes islet necrosis and
apoptosis. As a result, 50-70% of the transplanted islets are lost within the first 24 hours following infusion,
making achieving insulin independence extremely difficult.
Previous strategies to combat IBMIR include the use of anti-thrombotic drugs, such as heparin, which increases
bleeding risk, or low molecular weight dextran sulfate, which prevents cell aggregation, but fails to combat
inflammation and cytokine secretion that ultimately kills the islets or requires islet surface modification that
complicates cell processing. There is a need for a therapeutic that combats oxidation, inflammation, and
thrombosis associated with IBMIR without inducing bleeding.
Vitamin D (aVD; 1, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3) is a potent activator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2) antioxidant activity and a powerful inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent inflammation
and coagulation. aVD acts via interaction with the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR). However, VDR
interaction can be limited, as hydrophobic aVD has poor bioavailability and membrane permeability, both of which
limit therapeutic efficacy. Targeted aVD delivery is further complicated by the ubiquitous nature of VDR, which is
present in almost every cell. The highly cell-type specific results of aVD-VDR interaction can cause adverse
effects, including toxicity if the wrong cell population is treated. Vesicular polymeric nanocarriers (i.e.
polymersomes, PS) encapsulating vitamin D3 (aVD-PS) were found to enhance intracellular delivery of aVD
within antigen-presenting cells, reducing inflammatory markers, including CD80/86 and MHC II. PS can be
infused with the islets or targeted to the site of transplantation (the liver) via intravenous injection. Here, this
proposal will investigate aVD-PS’s biocompatibility with and ability to combat oxidative thrombo-inflammation
associated with IBMIR for the preservation of islets. The mechanisms by which aVD-PS mitigates oxidative
stress, thrombosis and inflammation will also be assessed. The following aims will be achieved:
1) Assess the biocompatibility of aVD-PS with human islets and the effect of aVD-PS on coagulation
under IBMIR conditions.
2) Assess the ability of aVD-PS to mitigate IBMIR in a murine islet transplantation model."
10951366,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by the loss of paternal
expression of a cluster of genes in the human 15q11-q13 region. Among the genes in the PWS deletion
region, the Magel2 gene is one of the genes responsible for the etiology of PWS. Loss of the mouse
Magel2 gene results in abnormalities in growth and fertility and increased adiposity with altered
metabolism in adulthood. Although the exact cellular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are not
yet fully determined, a recent study has shown deficits in secretory granule abundance and neuropeptide
production in the hypothalamus of Magel2-null mice. Magel2-null mice have lower levels of α-
melanocyte-stimulating hormone derived from POMC. As POMC neurons are primarily located in the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), the highly expressing Magel2 mRNA, a loss of function of
MAGEL would disrupt the central melanocortin system.
 We have recently elucidated the crucial function of the Magel2 gene in ARCPOMC neurons that
project to the MeA in regulating body weight. Decreasing the expression of Magel2 in this neural circuit
diminishes susceptibility to diet-induced obesity, consistent with previous investigations on PWS mouse
models, including mice deficient in the Magel2 and Snord116 genes, when fed a high-fat diet. However,
these prior findings diverge from the primary metabolic characteristics of PWS, such as excessive weight
gain and obesity. Hence, it is possible that central MAGEL2 may exert a significant influence on behavior
rather than energy metabolism.
 Key phenotypic PWS behaviors include temper outbursts, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive
behaviors, and social cognition deficits. My recent study found that sex hormone levels play a crucial role
in regulating daily home cage activity in females. Knockdown of the Magel2 gene in MeA-innervating
ARCPOMC neurons elevates plasma estrogen levels in females. Blockade of the G protein-coupled estrogen
receptor (GPER) but not the nuclear estrogen receptor-α in the brain completely abolishes this increased
home cage activity. Importantly, GPER is highly expressed in the MeA that controls social behavior,
aggression, and anxiety-like behavior. Hence, this pilot study aims to determine the effect of the loss of
function of the Magel2 gene in ARCPOMC neurons innervating the MeA on anxiety-like behavior.
 The primary goal of this pilot study is to produce more meaningful, applicable results
demonstrating that the Magel2 gene in MeA-projecting ARCPOMC neurons is a crucial factor controlling
the ability of ARCPOMC neurons to regulate anxiety-like behavior."
10951261,"TITLE: Unraveling Vascular Mediated Immune Exclusion in Melanoma
PROJECT SUMMARY
 Melanoma remains the primary cause of skin cancer-related deaths. A significant number of patients show
resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, while others experience disease progression after initial treatment benefits.
A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor immune suppression is essential. Effective
immunotherapy not only depends on cancer-specific T cells but also on their direct contact with tumor cells. The
exclusion of immune effector cells, such as cytotoxic T cells, from the tumor parenchyma has been linked to
reduced immunotherapy response. However, the exact biology behind this pattern in the tumor
microenvironment has yet to be fully understood. Recent research emphasizes the potential of targeting the
tumor vasculature to improve tumor immune suppression. The increased vascular leakiness associated with
vascular destabilization has been suggested to hinder immune effector cell infiltration into tumors. Angiopoietin-
2 (ANGPT2), a therapeutic target for many cancers, regulates vascular remodeling by modulating TIE2 receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling in endothelial cells. Our latest study demonstrated that ANGPT2 promotes T-cell
exclusion from tumor cores by causing vascular destabilization at the tumor periphery. This highlights the need
for a comprehensive analysis of vascular regulation in tumor immune exclusion and a deeper understanding of
the molecular mechanism through which ANGPT2 affects T-cell exclusion in melanoma.
 In this proposed study, we aim to investigate the vascular determinants of immune exclusion from the
tumor core in melanoma. We plan to elucidate the development of immune exclusions for different immune
cells during melanoma progression and examine the spatial vascular changes in correlation with immune cell
positions (Aim 1). Moreover, we will determine the molecular mechanisms behind ANGPT2-driven T-cell
exclusion in melanoma (Aim 2). This will involve elucidating the relationship between ANGPT2 expression
levels, vascular leakiness, and T-cell exclusion in human melanoma tissues and investigating the effects of
ANGPT2 inhibition on the development and progression of T-cell exclusion using mouse melanoma models.
Employing multi-omics methods, we aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms through which vascular
abnormalities contribute to immune exclusion in the tumor microenvironment of melanoma. Our proposed
study could identify novel targets and biomarkers to address the immune exclusion, potentially enhancing the
effectiveness of existing immunotherapies."
10949508,"Immune-mediated positron emission tomography (immunoPET) is an emerging imaging technique that enables
non-invasive in vivo pathology assessment, analogous to what is commonly used in immunohistology. This is
enabled by imaging of radiolabeled antibodies or antibody fragments. However, current immunoPET
approaches, including pre-targeted strategies, suffer from relatively poor signal-to-background ratio, in part
because of the suboptimal pharmacokinetics of the imaging probes used. Moreover, widespread clinical
translation of current immunoPET technologies is hampered by the complexity of manufacturing individual
probes, supply chain constraints, and the complex workflow requiring patients to present to the hospital
multiple times in strict coordination for any individual immunoPET study. In this Trailblazer proposal, we posit
that lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology can be harnessed for immunoPET to address several of the outlined
concerns. Extensive advances in LNP-mRNA now enable patients to be transient in vivo bioreactors for
therapeutic protein production, including antibodies and antibody fragments, offering an opportunity to improve
the kinetics of a protein-based imaging agent. Furthermore, LNP can be delivered via several routes that
potentially enable administration at a local pharmacy or even by self-administration. The purpose of this
Trailblazer proposal is to establish LNP-immunoPET as a viable platform for clinical molecular imaging. We will
assess the ability of LNP-mRNA to synthesize imageable antibody-based probes through radiohapten
interactions. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship of LNP administration route on the viability of the
LNP-immunoPET approach. If successful, LNP-immunoPET will offer a revolutionary strategy that will advance
the capability of immunoPET and extend the reach of molecular imaging and therapeutics for our patient
population."
10949695,"This proposal seeks to develop new statistical methods applicable to studies of bundled interventions.
Randomized clinical trials, including in dental research, often focus on multi-component and other complex
interventions. Using such ‘bundled’ interventions is appealing as a way to increase power – as well as
simplicity - of the study. An apparent disadvantage is that it is not clear how to assess the effects of individual
components of bundled interventions, which of also of frequent interest. While the measurement of treatment
compliance, and use of causal mediation analysis is commonly recognized as a possible approach, rigorous
methods to identify and estimate causal effects of components are not available. The present research seeks
to fill this important gap. We will first elucidate the assumptions under which causal mediation/path analysis
can be used to determine causal effects of individual intervention components. We propose, as a novel and
relevant estimand, what we refer to as a cluster-specific interventional effect. We will develop an extended
mediation formula/simulation approach to estimating these causal effects. In our second aim, we will extend
methods to handle repeatedly measured mediators and outcomes. As a novel aspect of this aim, new
methods will be developed to analyze summary (or cumulative) measures in a way that respects the causal
order of model variables. We will perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of the new methods,
and compare them to possible alternative approaches. In addition, we will develop sensitivity analysis
methods to examine the impact of violations of model assumptions, including extended sequential ignorability
as well as structural (e.g., no direct effect) assumptions. In particular, we extend a copula model approach,
previously developed for the single mediator case, to perform sensitivity analyses in the context of more
complex path models. We will develop an R package to allow user-friendly implementation of the new
methods. The new methods will be applied to data from a recently completed cluster-randomized clinical trial
of a multi-component intervention (including multiple provider-level components) to improve dental care
utilization among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in primary care settings.
Our analysis will assess the causal effects of individual components of this bundled intervention."
10949315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The vast array of genetic elements within a bacterial genome dictates its potential to cause disease. These
elements influence virulence, antibiotic susceptibility, and the ability to evade the immune response.
Understanding and manipulating these genetic components are crucial for identifying the drivers of bacterial
pathogenicity. However, a significant challenge arises because efficient genetic systems are typically limited to
laboratory-adapted strains. This limitation leaves many virulent clinical pathogens genetically intractable. To
address this challenge, we developed a genome editing platform on phage recombinase that works across a
broad range of species. Editing bacteria with phage recombinases, a process termed recombineering, has been
transformative in E coli. However, its reliance on host factors causes species-specificity that has limited its
broader impact. We discovered a phage protein that is conserved across bacterial phyla that can used to identify
broadly functioning phage recombinase systems. Leveraging this protein, we developed a recombineering
system that operates in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To further explore the potential of
phage-based genetic engineering, we have established a high-throughput selection to identify phage
recombinases from genomic material without relying on homology to existing recombinases. Coupling the
ubiquity of recombination modules in dsDNA phages with the vast diversity of genetic information encoded by
phage, we anticipate identifying numerous new phage-based recombination systems. Initial results have
demonstrated levels of genetic editing in the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus comparable to
recombineering in E coli. This work will transform the way we genetically manipulate bacteria, enabling us to
directly probe the genetic elements driving pathogenicity in clinically relevant strains."
10924023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research on racial socialization practices has been primarily conducted in families of color, and 
prevailing models have been developed around racial identity development among non-White children. There 
is a paucity of research on how we can leverage racial socialization practices in families, and in particular 
White families, to promote critical understandings about race, racism, and anti-racism among children—as a 
means to reduce racial bias, encourage prosocial behaviors and racial empathy, and improve social/emotional 
well-being among children, including positive peer relationships and interactions. There is limited scientific 
research on the role that parents can have in preventing racism and developing anti-racist children. This 
project is innovative by shifting the typical paradigm of intervening on racism, which has mostly been on how 
families of color buffer their children from racist experiences; for instance, through racial socialization practices 
to instill positive self-concept, and preparation for racial discrimination. We posit that an alternative approach—
one that is grounded in intervening on families to prevent the perpetration of racism—is warranted. 
We propose recruiting a national sample of parents and their K-2nd grade children. Qualitative data 
from focus groups will enhance the scientific basis for our intervention program—a multi-module app that 
guides parents in having “Color Brave” (as opposed to colorblind) conversations with their children. We test the 
intervention using a rigorous randomized attention/wait-list controlled trial design. The design of the 
intervention is based on research indicating that among children, positive intergroup contact with outgroup 
members, including vicarious engagement, can prevent or reduce anti-outgroup bias, in particular, when 
contact is based on common goals, cooperation rather than competition, and supported by external authorities. 
We collect a broad range of measures using mixed-methods, through one-one-one interviews with parents and 
children and dyadic interviews. Adapting the intervention for delivery via a downloadable app facilitates 
scalability resulting in greater potential to have wide social impact.
This work expands the scope of the science on how racial socialization practices can increase racial 
empathy, including among White children. This project aims to reduce the perpetration of racism, which is a 
documented societal and health hazard experienced by children of color. It also aims to enhance support for 
anti-racist practices and policies aimed at achieving health and social equity. The eventual goal of this 
research is to contribute to the cultivation and mobilization of anti-racist partners, and to help develop a 
concerted effort to dismantle racism and racist structures. This intervention may be part of a broader, 
comprehensive intergenerational and societal effort to eliminate racism and address its consequences."
10951042,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) is a collection of over 70 monogenic diseases associated with genetic
mutations in lysosomal enzymes or proteins. The clinical manifestations of LSD are heterogenous but often
include early-onset neurodegeneration with varying degrees of inflammation. The mechanism of inflammation
associated with LSD is unknown. We recently showed in Niemann-Pick disease type C1 that an intracellular
innate immune signaling pathway, STING, is activated due to impaired lysosomal degradation, leading to
inflammation and neuropathology. In this R21 application, we aim to directly examine whether STING is
required for pathogenesis of several lysosomal storage disorders using mouse models. We hypothesize that
STING is an “immunosensor” of lysosome activity and that lysosomal dysfunction activates the STING-
mediated immune signaling and lysosomal biogenesis. In Aim 1, we will breed mouse models of lysosomal
storage disorder with Sting-/- mice or treat with a STING antagonist to determine whether STING is required for
inflammation and disease pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms of STING activation and
STING-mediated lysosomal biogenesis. Together, we hope to define STING as a new drug target in lysosomal
diseases. This study will also establish a new clinical paradigm for considering STING antagonists as first-line
therapy for many lysosomal storage disorders."
10951116,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a bunyavirus, is transmitted by mosquitoes and has caused large outbreaks among humans and ruminants in many countries in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVFV outbreaks in the U.S. are quite possible and would cause serious public health, agricultural, and economic problems. The lack of availability of licensed vaccines or anti-RVFV reagents for use in humans or domestic animals is of great concern. RVFV is an enveloped RNA virus, carrying a tripartite, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome composed of L, M and S RNAs. Furthermore, antigenomic S RNA is also packaged efficiently in RVFV particles. L RNA encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and M RNA encodes the two major envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, along with two accessory proteins. The S RNA uses an ambi-sense coding strategy to express N and NSs, the latter of which suppresses host innate immune responses. One of the fundamental steps in a viral life cycle is the packaging of the viral genome into virus particles. The mechanism of genome packaging in bunyavirus differs from that of other envelope viruses, as most bunyaviruses, including RVFV, lack a matrix protein. We showed that Gn functions as a matrix protein surrogate and Gn-viral RNP interaction drives the packaging of RVFV RNAs. Although multiple regions of the RVFV RNAs directly bind to Gn in infected cells, noncoding regions of viral RNAs, which serve as cis-acting elements required for viral RNA replication, lack major Gn-binding sites, except for the presence of a prominent Gn-binding site, 6-25 region, at the 3’ end of the antigenomic S RNA. Notably, 6-25 region is important for efficient packaging of the antigenomic S RNA, leading to expression of NSs, which inhibits interferonβ mRNA transcription, early in RVFV infection. This indicates the contribution of 6-25 region to RVFV pathogenesis. Another notable feature of RVFV genome packaging is that L RNA undergoes inefficient packaging in the absence of other viral RNAs. We found that efficient L RNA packaging requires trans-acting functions of M RNA and N. Therefore, the overall goal of our proposal is to expand our understanding of the mechanism of viral RNA packaging in bunyaviruses, using RVFV as a model virus. Our central hypotheses are that presence of 6-25 region at the terminal region of the viral RNA is important for this region to function as a packaging signal, which promotes viral RNA packaging, and that adding 6-25 region to the terminal region of L RNA alters the L RNA packaging to be independent from the trans-acting functions of M RNA and N. Experiments testing these hypotheses and related studies proposed in the application will also provide new insights into development of a novel RVFV-based expression vector/vaccine platform and a safer live attenuated vaccine. Taken together, the data from the proposed studies will substantially advance our understanding of the mechanisms of bunyavirus RNA packaging, provide novel insight into RVFV pathogenicity at the molecular level, reveal the possible use of an attenuated strain of RVFV for wider scientific and medical applications, and open a new approach for improvement of live attenuated RVFV vaccine safety."

and after 10, and 20 visits of daily rTMS plus a 2 week maintenance phase. The proposal will use new
stimulation site and stimulation mode combinations that are different from previous rTMS trials on auditory
hallucination, but are conceptualized to be more closely linked to neural circuitry mechanisms of auditory
halluciantion formation. The proposal will include two phases as two separate projects. The first proposed
project is a R61 for two years. If the Go/Nogo milestones are not met, the study will end. If all Go/Nogo
milestones are met, it will proceed to a R33 project for three more years. The trial will test the proposed
mechanism of action at brain circuitry level and determine whether the new stimulation site and mode strategy
will indeed significantly engage the proposed circuitry of action through modulating its functional connectivity in
the direction for improving auditory hallucination."
10951356,"The dystonias overall are a rare neurologic disorder. Blepharospasm (BSP), is one of the most
common forms of dystonia. BSP is characterized by involuntary abnormal facial expressions and eye
closures. In addition to these overt motor abnormalities, the disorder is also associated with non-motor
symptoms including anxiety and depression. Treatment options for BSP are suboptimal. Many oral
medications have been tried but their efficacy is minimal and limited by dose-dependent adverse side
effects. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections repeated every 3-4 months are the primary treatment of
choice. Although BoNT is highly efficacious for many patients, for a variety of reasons about 1/3 of
patients discontinue BoNT treatment, and of those who continue treatment about 1/3 are unsatisfied
with the response.
 Because treatment options are suboptimal, there is an active effort to find better strategies for
treating BSP, as evidenced by dozens of trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, the most common
clinical outcome assessments used to measure motor abnormalities are intrinsically subjective
assessments and therefore suffer from inter-rater variability. This reduces our power to detect treatment
effects in clinical trials.
 Technology-based objective measures have the potential to circumvent this variability.
Advances in computer vision technology have enabled the measurement of facial expressions and eye
closure from 2-D images of the face in conventional video recordings. One of the long-term objectives
of our group is to leverage these advances to develop software that can capture and quantify motor
abnormalities across multiple types of focal dystonia. We are calling this system the Computational
Motor Objective Rater (CMOR). In this project specifically targeting BSP, our aims are 1) to evaluate
CMOR’s convergent validity with patient reports of severity of facial spasms and excessive blinking and
2) to determine CMOR’s sensitivity to changes in severity associated with interventions. To accomplish
these aims, we will conduct CMOR analyses of motor symptoms from video recordings of 100 BSP
patients enrolled in a separate Dystonia Coalition project to evaluate the variability of efficacy of BoNT.
That project will also acquire patient reports in the form of a patient centered outcome with specific
questions about the prominent motor features of BSP and the patient’s global impression of change
(PGIC) in response to each BoNT treatment. Collectively the results will provide important information
about CMOR’s validity and a quantitative basis for sample size estimates for future clinical trials in BSP."

 Culture-based diagnostics for the leprosy-causing agent Mycobacterium leprae are challenged by our
inability to culture the pathogen in vitro. Moreover, obtaining a sufficient quantity of bacilli relies on in vivo
models such as mice or armadillos in a process that requires significant resources and time because of the
slow growth of the pathogen. This extended timeframe, coupled with our inability to engineer recombinant M.
leprae strains in vitro, presents significant obstacles to investigating the mechanisms behind its pathogenicity
and drug resistance.
 Furthermore, to thoroughly study M. leprae's epidemiology, transmission, and evolution, it is
imperative to sequence M. leprae stains from all clinical and field origins. However, obtaining sufficient
bacterial DNA from human and animal samples is challenging. Over the past decade, extensive efforts have
been dedicated to enhancing our ability to sequence M. leprae genomes. Currently, two methods are
employed for this purpose, but they are limited in either their sensitivity, applicability to different tissue
samples, or high cost. As a result, these limitations are currently impeding the widespread use of genome
sequencing in leprosy research.
 We propose to develop a new method based on the selective whole genome amplification
(SWGA) of a minuscule quantity of M. leprae directly from complex samples. Our preliminary data on
DNA collected from laboratory-infected armadillos shows that SWGA could combine sensitive, accurate,
easy-to-implement, and cost-effective characteristics to successfully sequence M. leprae from complex
samples. This exploratory project aims to develop the SWGA method and compare it with the gold standard
bait capture to validate its use to sequence the genome of M. leprae from infected humans and animals. Aim
1 will evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of SWGA combined with short-read sequencing and its
applicability to long-read sequencing on M. leprae DNA extracted from laboratory and naturally infected
armadillo tissues. Aim 2 will generate and validate the necessary reagents to perform SWGA on M. leprae
DNA extracted from invasive (skin biopsy) and non-invasive (nasal swab) human samples."

 Institutional discrimination has limited access to important resources for Black, Indigenous, People of
Color (BIPOC) and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) communities, and have
impacted the quality of mental healthcare that these communities receive. Researchers have focused on
promoting cultural competency (CC) among therapists to address mental healthcare disparities for BIPOC and
LGBTQ+ communities. Therapist CC is broadly associated with improved clinical outcomes and therapeutic
alliance. However, current methods of assessing therapist CC are infeasible to implement in clinical settings.
Therapist-client power differentials limit clients from providing specific feedback, and behavioral coding is
infeasible to implement in healthcare systems given difficulties with scaling up session evaluations. Natural
language processing (NLP) provides a promising alternative to current methods of assessing and providing
feedback on therapist CC, and recent applications of NLP based tools to psychotherapy settings indicate that
they are viable methods of improving culturally responsive care. The purpose of the current study is to develop
a prototype of a NLP-based therapist CC feedback tool (HEAL). We will first create an annotated dataset by
coding 300 therapy sessions with a behavioral coding system assessing culturally responsive care (Aim 1). We
will then create a prototype of HEAL (Aim 2) by (a) developing a feedback visualizer based on input from
community advisory boards (CABs) comprised of supervisors and therapists, and BIPOC LGBTQ+ clients, (b)
selecting a speech recognition software, and (c) developing and validating NLP models based on the annotated
dataset from Aim 1. We will use rapid cycle prototyping and testing to iteratively revise HEAL, meeting monthly
with CAB members. We will assess acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and usability through interviews
with CAB members, and quantitative measures. Finally, we will pilot the prototype of HEAL with 15 therapists
using standardized patients, and assess acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and usability through
individual feedback interviews and quantitative measures (Aim 3). The results of this study will culminate in the
development of a novel therapist CC support tool, and ideally position me to pursue R01 funding to evaluate its
effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial. The proposed aims are in line with NIMH's strategic plan to develop
innovative service delivery models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received in
diverse communities and populations. The current study and training plan will allow me to develop expertise in
community partnership in user centered design, and understand how cultural contexts and biases impact NLP
models, and strongly position me to be a leader in multidisciplinary community-based research developing
innovative methods of addressing mental healthcare inequities."

Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart muscle can’t pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs
for blood and oxygen. Heart failure affects over 5 million Americans and it is a serious condition that can be life-
threatening if left untreated. Decompensated heart failure is the leading cause of hospital readmissions in the
US. A common symptom of decompensation is the development of peripheral edema. Detecting edema can
provide important clinical information to healthcare providers regarding the severity of the patient's heart failure
and help guide treatment decisions. However, currently patients are asked to watch for edema themselves by
checking their weight or noticing swelling of the legs/ankles and signs are often missed until the late stages of
decompensation. In this context there is a need for a remote monitor that can offer an earlier warning and permit
telehealth interventions to reduce hospital readmissions. Using our previously developed FlexNIRS platform we
propose to build and validate a multi-wavelength wearable edema and microcirculation monitor and conduct a
pilot clinical trial in patients admitted due to decompensate cardiac failure in which we will seek to demonstrate
that physiological parameters related to re-compensation can be followed non-invasively and thus support the
future conduct of larger scale studies of at home monitoring to detect decompensation."

 The overall goal of this mentored career award is to establish my independent research career centered
on improving perinatal health outcomes for the most vulnerable. One untested, promising way to do so is to
examine how reduction in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms experienced during pregnancy and
the postpartum period may affect subsequent health outcomes. PTSD is an under-recognized and untreated risk
factor for adverse perinatal health outcomes. Black women, and rural-dwelling women are often the most likely
to experience adverse perinatal outcomes, the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality, and increased risk
for trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD symptoms. Engaging pregnant and postpartum individuals in PTSD
treatment is critical as there are serious risks associated with untreated perinatal PTSD that often extend into
the next generation. Although evidence-based treatments exist for PTSD, clinical research on treatment for
perinatal PTSD is limited, with few studies sufficiently engaging Black women and none targeting rural-dwelling
women. Targeting perinatal PTSD in Black women, and rural-dwelling women presents a unique opportunity to
improve maternal health and eliminate health disparities.
 To address these gaps in the literature, I propose a randomized controlled pilot study (the New
Empowerment after eXposure to Trauma (NEXT) study). This study will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility
of a revised brief (6-week) virtual PTSD protocol (Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)) targeting Black women
and rural-dwelling women. Training activities utilizing community engaged methods and qualitative data
collection will be used to tailor the protocol for maximal acceptability and uptake among Black, and rural-dwelling
women prior to the pilot trial. This pilot study will evaluate a revised NET protocol against a standard care control
condition. This will be the first rigorous evaluation of a brief perinatal PTSD protocol specifically tailored for Black
and rural-dwelling perinatal individuals, and results will be of high interest to local and national stakeholders.
 The proposed study will lay the foundation for an R01 application for an RCT designed and powered to
examine if reduction in PTSD symptoms can reduce likelihood of adverse perinatal outcomes in high-risk, under-
represented, vulnerable perinatal populations. This project is specifically designed to address my training goals
to develop expertise in: (1) participant-centered methodological approaches to increase recruitment and
engagement of minoritized populations; (2) health equity considerations for perinatal populations; and (3)
conducting rigorous clinical trials that improve healthcare in all groups of women. To complete these goals, I
have assembled an extraordinary mentorship team with expertise in perinatal populations, health equity,
academic community partnerships, qualitative data, and conducting clinical trials with perinatal women. I have
created a highly structured training plan that will be supported by the rich training environment at the Indiana
University School of Medicine and affiliated hospitals and clinics."

Itch is an unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire or the reflex to scratch. Chronic itch is a characteristic
symptom of Atopic Dermatitis (AD), one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases and a significant cause
of patient suffering. Another hallmark of AD is microbial dysbiosis with increased Staphylococcus aureus on the
skin. Over 90% of AD skin lesions are positive for S. aureus. Here, I propose to investigate the role of S. aureus-
induced itch and neuro-immune signaling in driving skin barrier damage and immune responses. My preliminary
data show that epicutaneous exposure to S. aureus induces robust itch behaviors (spontaneous itch and
alloknesis) and resulting skin pathology in mice. I identified the serine protease V8 (SspA) as a critical factor in
mediating both itch and dermatitis. V8 directly activates itch neurons through its receptor Proteinase-Activated
Receptor 1 (PAR1). I hypothesize that S. aureus and V8 protease-induced itch trigger skin inflammation and
impact neuroimmune signaling. In Specific Aim 1, I will define the contribution of V8 protease, neurons, and itch
to skin immune responses. I will inoculate mice with wildtype or isogenic V8-deficient (∆sspA) S. aureus strains
and perform detailed flow cytometry to profile the skin immune population. I will utilize genetic approaches to
ablate specific skin-innervating neurons (Trpv1+ and Mrgprd+) to assay their role in itch and inflammation. I will
treat mice with the Par1 antagonist Vorapaxar to determine how itch and scratching drive skin immune
responses. In Specific Aim 2, I will characterize the neuronal response to S. aureus and V8 protease. Itch is
mediated by dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. I will perform RNA-sequencing of DRGs to identify
transcriptional changes following S. aureus exposure. I will use reporter mice (Nav1.8-cre/tdTomato) to label
sensory neurons and for whole mount confocal microscopy to quantify epidermal neuron density in naïve and S.
aureus exposed mice. I will culture DRG neurons with S. aureus or purified V8 protease and perform ELISAs to
measure secreted neuropeptides. I hypothesize that S. aureus and V8-induced itch/scratching contribute
significantly to skin pathology in AD. In Specific Aim 3, I will utilize Tmem79-/- mouse model of AD to investigate
microbe-neuron interactions. I will colonize Tmem79-/- mice with WT and ∆sspA S. aureus and measure itch and
dermatitis. I will surgically denervate the back skin of Tmem79-/- mice and perform flow cytometry and multiplex
ELISA to identify immune changes. I will perform 16S sequencing of skin samples from control and denervated
Tmem79-/- mice to determine the role of neurons in regulating the skin microbiome in AD skin. I will also determine
whether S. aureus colonization changes in denervated mice. This work will reveal novel molecular crosstalk
between S. aureus, neurons, and immune cells in itch and AD. The three aims of this study leverage my unique
skillsets and training by combining microbiological, neurobiological, and immunological approaches. Given the
importance of itch in AD and other skin diseases, investigating how microbe-neuron crosstalk drive itch and
dermatitis could transform our understanding of host-microbe interactions at the skin barrier."

Approximately 40% of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) cases in the U.S. (and 56% in Latin America) are due to
modifiable lifestyle factors such as hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol use, and smoking.
People who engage in more physical activity, eat healthier meals, avoid substance use, and get preventative
check-ups, tend to have better cognitive health, slower cognitive decline, and are at lower risk for late detection
of disease and AD diagnosis. Yet, comprehensive theories of self-regulation and healthy aging suggest that
engaging in healthy behaviors is promoted by environmental opportunities (or hindered by constraints). This
potential discrepancy between health behaviors and environmental opportunities is referred to as a behavior-
opportunity gap, which can be characterized as matched (level of health behavior and opportunity match),
vulnerable (less health behavior than expected given opportunities), and resilient (more health behavior than
expected given opportunities). Identifying the direction of behavior-opportunity gaps is critical because it impacts
potential targets for effectively preventing AD: increasing health behavior uptake vs. policy changes to increase
accessibility to healthy amenities. Despite recognized importance, the present proposal is among the first to
identify associations between behavior-opportunity gaps and cognitive health, due to a dearth of longitudinal
data containing both individual-level health behaviors and geographical-level environmental opportunities. This
is a particularly pressing need for minoritized populations, who face disproportionate barriers in accessing
environmental resources, stronger associations between modifiable lifestyle factors and AD risk, and spend more
living years cognitively impaired. The long-term goal of this research is to identify how to effectively promote
healthy cognitive aging in place for diverse older adults. The objectives for this application are to conduct
geographical linkages to maximize the scientific value of an existing NIA-funded longitudinal family study of
Mexican-origin immigrants living in the U.S. (Aim 1) and to identify associations between behavior-opportunity
gaps and midlife cognitive health (Aim 2). Aim 1 will geocode 17 years of annual address data for 1,784
individuals and link to publicly-available geographical data containing indicators of environmental opportunities.
Aim 2 will combine geographical data with extant health behavior and cognitive function data to identify
associations among behavior-opportunity gaps and midlife cognitive health among Mexican-origin immigrants.
The central hypothesis is that larger behavior-opportunity gaps will be associated with worse cognitive health
over and above main effects of the behavior and environmental characteristic, such that vulnerable individuals
will have worse cognitive function compared to matched and resilient individuals. This work will lead to new
knowledge about the intersection of health behaviors and environmental opportunities as prevention and
intervention targets for promoting healthy cognitive aging in place among minoritized adults."

 Improving outcomes for adult depression in primary care is a leading health care priority and
antidepressants are a cornerstone of evidence-based treatment. However, patient non-adherence and
discontinuation are common. The proposed study examines use of modest financial incentives in conjunction
with tailored text message reminders to determine the most effective and cost-effective support for establishing
consistent antidepressant medication taking routines to improve clinical outcomes of adult primary care patients
with depression.
 We propose to conduct a 3-arm RCT (N=525, n=175 per arm) to compare with usual care the short-term
and extended effectiveness of two adherence support strategies for primary care patients with depression who
have been newly prescribed antidepressant medications. We will examine whether personalized daily text
messages with and without financial incentives improves antidepressant adherence and depression symptoms.
Adherence will be measured with a wireless pill bottle at 6 and 12 weeks and by assessment of electronic health
prescription records at 24 and 52 weeks. Depression symptoms will be collected via telephone by a trained
assessor at 6 and 12 weeks. Our Specific Aims are to:
 1. Determine the relative effectiveness of 1) 12 weeks of personalized daily text reminders without financial
 incentives (reminders alone), 2) 12 weeks of the text reminders paired with 6 weeks of financial incentives
 (reminders and incentives), compared with 3) usual care, and with each other (non-inferiority). The
 primary outcome will be symptom response on the PHQ-9 depression rating scale at 12 weeks.
 2. Explore the effectiveness of each study intervention arm compared to usual care and to each other on
 antidepressant adherence at 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks, and whether these effects are moderated by
 baseline financial security and adherence intentions. We also will assess whether the intervention effects
 in Aim 1 are mediated by antidepressant adherence.
 3. Use qualitative inquiry of antidepressant adherent and non-adherent study patients to explore
 opportunities to maximize the effectiveness of the financial incentives and reminders to increase
 antidepressant medication adherence.
 Widespread problems with antidepressant adherence, especially during the early stage of treatment,
undermine the primary care treatment of depression. This study will test whether personalized daily text
messages grounded in behavioral economics principles alone or combined with financial incentives based on
contingency management principles improves depression outcomes. These two interventions are designed to
be readily adapted into primary care workflows through an automated patient-facing system to improve clinical
outcomes of adult primary care patients with depression."

 Cell metabolism plays a crucial role in regulating the activation of immune cells in host defense to infection
and the development of inflammatory diseases. Different aspects of cell metabolism can regulate the activation
of immune cells toward pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses. Thus, proper metabolic
reprogramming in immune cells is crucial to maintaining active immunity, while aberrant regulation of immune
cell metabolism can contribute to disease development.
 Emerging evidence indicates that fatty acid synthesis plays a crucial role in immunity and disease
development since fatty acids are key components of cellular processes including membrane function, signal
transduction, and energy generation. Recent studies suggest that fatty acid synthesis is closely associated with
a pro-inflammatory phenotype of immune cells and the development of some inflammatory diseases, implying
that modifications in fatty acid synthesis can be used as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metabolic
and inflammatory diseases.
 We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the central enzyme of fatty acid synthesis,
significantly alleviated the pathology of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice by
reducing the inflammatory responses in immune cells and skin. However, the detailed mechanism of fatty acid
synthesis-dependent skin inflammation is not clear due to the systemic and non-cell type-specific effects of the
inhibitors. Additionally, it is not clear how cell metabolism in immune cells or skin tissues changes during the
development of skin inflammation and how the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis affects metabolic reprograming.
To understand the role of fatty acid synthesis in cells and tissues in skin inflammation, we will generate cell-
specific Fasn-deficient mice and examine how inhibition of fatty acid synthesis affects the other metabolic
pathways in immune cells and skin tissues. We will be able to better understand the previously unidentified role
and regulatory mechanism of fatty acid synthesis in immune cells and psoriasis.
 The proposed studies will help us better understand the metabolic regulation of immune cells and will lead
to novel insights into fatty acid synthesis and immune function in the context of skin disease. By identifying
previously uncharacterized distinct and specific pathways regulated by fatty acid synthesis, we will be able to
expand our knowledge to other inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases,
which will further guide us in developing novel targeted therapies for treating autoimmune diseases, metabolic
disorders, and inflammatory disorders."

This R21 application is based on exciting and novel preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that the
orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 restrains the protective function of CD8+ T cells in tuberculosis (TB). We
found the NR4A1-/- mice control pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) significantly
better than wildtype (WT) mice. A similar effect was observed in WT mice treated with the NR4A1
antagonist DIM-C. In an adoptive transfer experiment, NR4A1-/- CD8+ T cells protected Rag1-/- mice from
aerosol Mtb infection better than transferred CD8+ T cells from NR4A1-/- or WT donors. This is remarkable
since prior studies found little or no protection from transferred WT CD8+ T cells, which was confirmed in
our experiment. Immunohistochemistry of lung TB lesions showed greater infiltration of CD8+ T cells in
NR4A1-/- mice compared to WT. Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from purified lung CD8+ T cells from
Mtb-infected mice identified upregulation of genes linked to cellular infiltrative capacity and cytotoxicity in
NR4A1-/- compared to WT hosts. If true, these findings will advance the field of cellular immunity in TB and
offer translation potential for NR4A1 inhibition as host-directed therapy. Expression of NR4A1 is induced by
T cell receptor signaling, which is the predominant mechanism for regulating its activity. We found that
NR4A1 mRNA is increased in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice, raising the fundamental question whether
NR4A1-regulated T cell tolerance supports a pathogen-permissive environment in TB. The goal of this R21
application is to confirm and extend key findings of the TB phenotyping, adoptive transfer, and DIM-C
treatment experiments, and to enhance these studies with more detailed outcome measures. We also plan
to perform single cell RNA sequencing of lung leukocytes and spatial transcriptomic studies in Mtb-infected
NR4A1-/- and WT mice as a first step towards identifying and prioritizing mechanistic hypotheses on which
to base a future RO1 proposal. Accordingly, we describe a research plan that is feasible to complete within
two years with the deliverables of an initial publication and a competitive RO1 application."

Choline is a vitamin-like metabolite that is indispensable for cellular and organismal viability which must be
obtained through diet. Once imported into the cell, choline has multiple metabolic fates influencing diverse
cellular processes ranging from membrane biosynthesis to epigenetics. Choline it is a key constituent of
phospholipids, acetylcholine, and betaine which in turn impacts S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and DNA
methylation. Despite the influence of choline on diverse cellular processes, the identity of a high affinity choline
transporter ubiquitously expressed across mammalian tissues was unknown. In our recently published
preliminary data, we utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of serum metabolites to identify a poorly
characterized plasma membrane protein, feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1), as the
predominant choline transporter in mammals. In human cells and the developing mouse embryo, FLVCR1 loss
severely impacts choline metabolism resulting in depletion of betaine and phosphatidylcholine (PC) – the
predominant phospholipid species in cellular and organellar membranes. Mechanistically, FLVCR1 directly
transports choline into cells and we have recently used CryoEM to identify the residue necessary for transport.
In this effort, we also discovered that FLVCR1 can also transport ethanolamine, suggesting that it may also affect
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis, the second most abundant membrane phospholipid. Taken together,
these data suggest that FLVCR1 is a crucial transporter for phospholipid metabolism. Broadly, this proposal
seeks to investigate the influence of phospholipid metabolism on cellular and organismal physiology.
 Utilizing a conditional knockout mouse, in Aim 1, we will study the role of FLVCR1 in organismal
physiology and metabolism and assess the efficacy of FLVCR1 as a target in metabolic disease. Our preliminary
data suggest that mitochondrial stress and activation of the integrated stress response are defining features of
cells and embryos lacking FLVCR1. In Aim 2 we will study how FLVCR1 loss and phospholipid metabolism
impacts mitochondrial function and the subsequent cellular stress response. In Aim 3 we seek to understand
how phospholipid homeostasis is maintained and regulated.
 Spanning basic biochemistry to mouse modeling, this application will address outstanding fundamental
questions in cellular metabolism and seek to apply these findings to the possible treatment of human disease.
The innovative studies proposed in this application in addition to the personalized training plan, will provide
rigorous scientific training and professional development which will enable my transition to independence and
start my own laboratory as a tenure-track professor."

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading global cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Uterine atony,
insufficient uterine contractility after placental delivery, causes 80% of PPH. Oxytocin is the medical standard of
care for prophylaxis and first line treatment of PPH. However, the mechanism whereby oxytocin causes uterine
contractility remains incompletely understood. There is a critical need to determine (1) how oxytocin causes
uterine contractility, and (2) the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie compromised oxytocin response
in uterine atony. Such knowledge is integral to the discovery of novel, targeted treatments for uterine atony.
Recent data in mice highlight a role for the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel in oxytocin-
mediated uterine contractility. To address human uterine contractility, Dr. Ansari proposes innovative
translational research using uterine tissue and derived smooth muscle cell cultures from cohorts of parturients
with normal contractility and uterine atony. She will uncover molecular and cellular mechanisms of human uterine
contractility in normal physiology versus uterine atony, define the role of the TRPV4 channel, and explore
whether pharmacologic activation of TRPV4 may represent a novel uterotonic strategy. The first aim centers on
normal, physiologic contractility, and the second on the pathophysiology of uterine atony: Aim 1) Determine the
functional relationship between oxytocin and TRPV4 and the mechanisms of TRPV4 activation in normal uterine
contractility; and Aim 2) Define TRPV4-dependent and TRPV4-independent mechanisms underlying uterine
atony through cellular and molecular assays including single nuclei RNA sequencing.
Dr. Ansari’s training will be conducted under the experienced mentorship of Dr. David N. Cornfield (smooth
muscle biology, calcium signaling, and single cell transcriptomics), and Dr. Virginia Winn (maternal fetal
medicine, basic and translational research in obstetrics), in conjunction with expert advisors in TRPV channel
biology, biobanking, uterine atony, and PPH. This training will be enhanced by the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub
Physician Scientist Fellowship program, advanced coursework in translational medicine, single cell RNA
sequencing, and research laboratory management, and the supportive infrastructure of Stanford’s Maternal-
Fetal Medicine and Obstetric Anesthesia Divisions. Through this K23, Dr. Ansari will obtain broad-based
knowledge and skills in laboratory research including advanced experiential training in uterine smooth muscle
biology, calcium signaling, and single cell transcriptomics. These skills will equip her to pursue her long-term
goal to develop an independent research career identifying new therapeutic targets for uterine atony at the bench
with the ultimate goal of translating discoveries to clinical care to address PPH."

MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment response in pediatric brain tumors.
Neuro-oncology MRI protocols often take more than 20 minutes, and this prolonged duration makes it difficult
for pediatric subjects to keep motionless. Sedation is used to ensure immobility but has profound implications.
For the patients, sedation carries risks of acute anesthetic complications and the potential for adverse
neurocognitive effects in the long term. For the healthcare system, sedation increases the wait time for exams
and triples the cost.
 Recent studies have raised concerns about the deposition of Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in
the brain and body, regardless of renal function. Due to the long life span of children and the high burden of
GBCA exposure in oncology patients, children with cancer constitute a particularly vulnerable population and
are at risk for developing long-term adverse effects that might not become manifest in other populations.
 Quantitative MRI (qMRI) is a technique that can measure biophysical tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2,
reproducibly across different MRI systems and provide standard contrast-weighting images synthesized from
the measured parameter maps. However, the speed limitations of qMRI, the sensitivity to motion degradation,
and partial volume effects have hindered its clinical adoption.
 This project aims to address unmet needs in pediatric tumor imaging by developing a rapid and motion-
robust qMRI acquisition. This proposal aims (i) to develop cutting-edge technologies for rapid, motion-robust,
and quantitative scans that reduce the need and the amount of sedation or rescan, thus mitigating the long-term
cognitive effects of sedatives in children, (ii) to synthesize clinically desired full-dose post-contrast images from
the measured biophysical tissue parameters acquired from a low-dose qMRI acquisition.
 The developed technology will be clinically translated and deployed in children with brain tumors. The
developed techniques will be rigorously analyzed by (i) assessing the improvements in image quality of the
motion-corrected sequences on non-sedated children and (ii) evaluating the diagnostic/clinical equivalency of
the synthetic and post-contrast images on children with brain tumors. All developed technology will be
disseminated by employing the customer-to-producer (C2P) software package and the framework for image
reconstruction environments (FIRE) package, provided by Siemens Healthineers, for running the developed
techniques on clinical scanners and helping effectively disseminate to other institutes."
10949486,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Children born very preterm are at increased risk for deficits in attention and executive function, two domains that
are strongly implicated in long-term health and developmental outcomes. We have not yet identified modifiable
environmental factors that could prevent or mitigate cognitive deficits in very preterm children at school age,
though research with younger children suggests that caregiving quality is a potent protective factor.
Understanding relationships between dimensions of caregiving quality and child attention and executive function
at school-age is critically important as the transition to formal schooling poses new challenges for children and
families. Yet, existing interventions targeting caregiving quality in preterm dyads have exclusively focused on
early infancy and not surprisingly, the positive effects of these interventions are completely washed out by school
age. A wider focus on caregiving as a protective factor for preterm children during the sensitive period
represented by the transition to formal schooling is critical. With funds from our prior awards (R01HD072267;
R01HD084515), we established a cohort of very preterm infants recruited at birth (NOVI Study) and have
demonstrated prospective associations among early caregiving factors (e.g., psychological distress) and child
neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 2. The NOVI cohort was selected for inclusion in the NIH Environmental
Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program (UG3OD23347; UH3OD23347) which provided funding
for extensive phenotypic characterization of NOVI children through age 7, including assessments of child
attention and executive function. We additionally collected an observational measure of caregiving quality at the
age 7 visit which was not part of the ECHO protocol and requires additional resources for coding and analysis.
The current proposal aims to code multiple dimensions of caregiving quality (e.g., caregiver sensitivity and
structuring) from the observational caregiver-child interaction task. These new data will provide vital information
that could explain the tremendous variability in child attention and executive function we observe in the NOVI
cohort. Using both new and existing data, this proposal aims to determine (a) child-, caregiver-, and family-
related predictors of caregiving quality and (b) associations between caregiving quality and child attention and
executive function during the school-age period in children born very preterm. Findings from this study will
advance theory regarding the contributions of caregiving quality to the development of very preterm children and
could be used to create interventions to mitigate cognitive deficits in very preterm children during the transition
to school. By pinpointing predictors of caregiving quality, these results could also be used to identify preterm
children and their caregivers who could benefit most from a novel caregiving intervention."

Mounting evidence supports a central role for chronic inflammation in obesity and metabolic dysfunction, yet our
understanding of actual causal links remains limited. We have identified and characterized numerous points of
crosstalk between inflammation and the metabolic effects of overnutrition. Activation of the innate immune
system triggers the robust production of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have potent roles in
metabolism. One such gene encodes for the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 that is conjugated to target proteins in
a reversible process referred to as ISGylation. Our preliminary data show diet-induced obesity increases liver
expression of Isg15 and protein ISGylation. Deficiency in liver Isg15 (ISG15LKO) renders mice resistant to diet-
induced weight gain, and improves insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis. The liver, however, is not a
thermogenic organ. Therefore, the impact of liver ISGylation on the regulation of body weight is likely mediated
through endocrine signaling to other organs capable of influencing food intake, locomotor activity and/or energy
expenditure. To identify ISGylated proteins, we engineered endogenously tagged Isg15 mice, and mass
spectrometry proteomics data revealed robust enrichment of proteins involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial
oxidation. The overall goal of this proposal is to interrogate the role of liver ISGylation in regulating organismal
energy balance. The central hypothesis is that in the liver, obesity triggers ISGylation of critical oxidative
proteins that influence the hepatocyte secretome and promote weight gain, either by increasing food intake or
decreasing energy expenditure. This hypothesis will be tested through the following two specific aims. Aim 1 will
determine the effects of hepatic ISGylation on energy balance, and Aim 2 will identify liver ISGylation targets
responsible for systemic metabolic regulation."

Respiratory viruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause a spectrum of clinical diseases ranging from
asymptomatic carriage to severe pneumonia. Healthy children are much more likely to develop severe
viral pneumonia than healthy adults and lung injury during childhood is associated with long-term
impairments in respiratory health. There is a paucity of information regarding why children are highly
susceptible to viral pneumonia and how they recover from severe disease. Children with severe viral
pneumonia present to the pediatric intensive care unit with an established infection and lung injury.
Currently, therapies for viral-induced lung injury are supportive and do not directly modify the pathology or
accelerate recovery. Thus, there is a need to understand the age-specific mechanisms that promote recovery
from severe viral pneumonia in children to aid in developing novel therapeutic strategies. Infection of mice
with murine-adapted strains of influenza A virus (IAV) mimics many of the clinical features of severe viral
pneumonia. Our group developed a mouse model of IAV infection that recapitulates clinical disease in children
less than 5 years of age. We previously reported that juvenile mice exhibit a persistent, excessive
inflammatory response to IAV despite adequate viral clearance. The resulting lung injury suggests juveniles
fail to resolve inflammation and fail to repair the alveolar epithelium during severe disease. Regulatory T (Treg)
cells mediate inflammation resolution and tissue repair. Adult murine models define an essential role for Treg
cells in the recovery from severe viral pneumonia, however, studies in age-appropriate murine models are
lacking. This proposal hypothesizes that during severe viral pneumonia in children, the reparative function of
Treg cells is impaired, and Treg cells fail to mitigate excessive proinflammatory responses and promote tissue
repair. The specific aims are 1) Determine whether juvenile regulatory T cells have impaired reparative
functions during severe viral pneumonia, 2) Determine whether the age-specific lung microenvironment during
severe influenza pneumonia affects regulatory T cell pro-recovery functions, and 3) Determine if alveolar
regulatory T cell transcriptional signatures are associated with outcomes in pediatric patients with severe viral
pneumonia.The project was explicitly designed to facilitate the career development of the primary
investigator (PI). It will provide experiential learning augmented with structured training opportunities to
advance the PI to independent investigator status. Specific training domains include advanced methods of
assessing alveolar injury and repair, flow cytometric analysis of immune cell phenotypes, assays to
assess T cell function, systems biology approaches to identifying novel genomic determinates of T cell
function, and design of translational studies using patients’ clinical and molecular data. This proposal will lay
the foundation for an iterative translational approach the PI can continue to use throughout his career to
achieve his long-term goal of identifying therapeutic targets to hasten recovery and improve long-term
respiratory health of children with severe viral pneumonia."

The study of the genetic basis of craniofacial adaptations in naturally divergent groups of species can provide
an opportunity to uncover novel gene networks and genome regulatory elements with clinical relevance. One of
the most remarkable examples of craniofacial diversification across vertebrates is represented in teleost fishes,
often associated with their diverse and highly specialized modes of feeding. In my early postdoctoral career, I
leveraged a recently established evolutionary model of Cyprinodon pupfishes and established it as a new model
system in eco-evo-devo1. This radiation is endemic to San Salvador Island (SSI), and includes a generalist
pupfish (Cyprinodon variegatus), and two trophic specialists, the scale-eater C. desquamator, with longer oral
jaws, increased oral tooth number, and larger mandibular muscles and the molluscivore, C. brontotheroides, with
a shorter jaw with and a novel maxillary extension. Only a few mutations are found to be fixed between
specialists2, with almost all of them found in regulatory or intronic regions, suggesting that the genetic changes
underlying SSI pupfish craniofacial divergence lie in regions of the genome that affect gene expression control.
I hypothesize that temporal and spatial changes in the expression of novel craniofacial candidate genes
within the specialist’s gene regulatory networks (i.e., gba3, pycr3, or galr2a) are caused by dynamics
differences in the chromatin state of their regulatory regions during development, which in turns,
underpins the divergent craniofacial morphological development observed in SSI pupfishes. To test this,
I will combine tissue-specific differential expression analysis (Aim 1) with genome-wide studies of chromatin
accessibility (Aim 2) in three developmental stages (embryonic pharyngula, hatched larvae, and metamorphic
fry) from divergent and non-divergent tissues among SSI pupfish species (oral jaws vs. tail caudal region). In
Aim 1, I will identify tissue-specific and specialist-specific spatiotemporal gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by
analyzing tissue-specific differential gene expression (DGE) (Aim 1.1) and alternative splicing identification (Aim
1.2) between SSI pupfish’s transcriptomes, life stages, and tissues. In Aim 2, I will explore chromatin state
dynamics by analyzing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) across SSI species, life stages, and
tissues. I will integrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of DGE and alternative splice variants with chromatin
accessibility analyses to build a predictive model to identify and test novel craniofacial gene networks and
regulatory regions crucial for pupfish craniofacial divergence (Aim 3.1). The top 5 novel craniofacial candidate
genes within the inferred GRN and with paired differences in chromatin accessibility will be tested using
HCR (Aim 3.1), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (Aim 3.2), and Tol2 transgenesis (Aim 3.3). This study will reveal
the different levels of genome regulation governing the evolution and development of craniofacial divergence,
opening new avenues of research to understand the genomic basis of craniofacial specialization with potential
implications for human craniofacial variation and disease."
10949537,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are common, affecting 3% of the global population with emerging
data suggesting that many are attributable to a genetic etiology. In the DEAD-box family of RNA Helicases,
18% of the genes have been shown to be important for neurodevelopment with pathogenic variants leading to
a range of NDD. Through the proposed NIH Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development (K08) Award, the
role of the DEAD-Box encoding gene, EIF4A2, in interneuron development will be evaluated
 Pathogenic variants in EIF4A2 lead to a NDD characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy,
hypotonia and structural changes in the developing brain. Modelling of EIF4A2 missense variants in Drosophila
demonstrates that both loss- and gain-of-EIF4A2-function alter neurodevelopment. However, the mechanisms
by which EIF4A2 loss- or gain-of-function alter brain development and the timing of these events have yet to
be determined. Preliminary studies utilizing acute CRISPR gene editing of zebrafish demonstrate that loss of
EIF4A2 leads to a reduction in interneuron number, suggesting reduced GABA interneuron generation,
impaired differentiation and/or alterations in migration may have occurred.
 In this K08 proposal, the role of EIF4A2 in interneuron development and the impact of loss and gain of
function on this process will be studied in zebrafish. Zebrafish are an optimal model system since they permit
rapid genetic editing, are excellent for live imaging, and have well conserved stages of neurodevelopment. The
following 5 groups will be compared: wild type controls (WT), eif4a2 +/-, eif4a2 -/- , WT with overexpressed
EIF4A2 mRNA, and eif4a2 -/- with EIF4A2 mRNA rescue. In Aim 1, EIF4A2 loss- and gain-of-function
zebrafish models will be generated and their phenotypes characterized. In Aim 2, using these models, the role
of EIF4A2 in interneuron progenitor cell generation and differentiation will be examined. In Aim 3, the impact of
loss- and gain-of EIF4A2 function on GABA interneuron migration will be assessed. By understanding
EIF4A2’s role in each aspect of interneuron development, targets of opportunity for future investigation will be
identified for both EIF4A2-associated NDD and more common conditions involving interneuron dysfunction.
 International experts in neurobiology, zebrafish, genetics, and neurogenetics will provide mentorship for
this proposed Career Development Award. The primary mentor will be Ann Poduri, MD, MPH. The Scientific
Advisory Committee will be composed of Kevin Staley, MD, David Sweetser, MD, PhD, Gordon Fishell, PhD,
and Pankaj Agrawal, MD, MMSc. They will provide guidance for both the short-term goal of understanding the
role that EIF4A2 plays in neurodevelopment and the long-term goal of improving neurodevelopmental
outcomes of infants and children with both rare and common causes of NDD."

Liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as viral hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic
liver disease (MASLD), and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is a significant health
problem. The hepatocyte injury during CLDs is followed by replacement of liver parenchyma by fibrotic tissue
with excessive deposition of collagen rich extra-cellular matrix. The activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are
primary source of liver fibrotic tissue. In spite of intensive research, the mechanisms of fibrosis and activation
of HSCs is not completely understood and the development of efficient anti-fibrotic agents remains a priority.
Autophagy, an intracellular degradation pathway, plays an important role in diverse cellular processes in health
and disease. Autophagy has several beneficial effects on the hepatocytes including insulin sensitivity and
degradation of intracellular lipids in the hepatocytes (lipophagy). Autophagy also prevents hepatocyte injuries
including those caused by oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines.
The role of autophagy in HSCs is, however, ambiguous. Numerous studies depict autophagy as a pro-
fibrogenic process due to its association with HSC activation and liver fibrosis. The main mechanism
underlying autophagy-mediated HSC activation and fibrosis is autophagy-mediated lipid droplet (LD) depletion
which has been shown to concur with HSC activation. On the other hand, several studies show anti-fibrotic
effects of autophagy via promotion of HSC death, degradation of pro-fibrotic mediators including collagen and
metalloproteinases, and inhibition of pro-fibrotic signal carrying exosomes. These discrepancies may be
attributable to the traditionally inefficient and inaccurate autophagy markers, instances of lack of cell-type
specific studies, context of autophagy modulation in relation to the hepatic injury, and the role of autocrine/
paracrine signaling in fibrosis. It is noteworthy that several anti-fibrotic agents including statins are known to
induce autophagy. We hypothesize that precise morphological detection of autophagic process will
clarify the role of autophagy in HSC activation. We will address this hypothesis with the following specific
aims: 1) To morphologically determine the status of autophagy during HSC activation using a novel HaloTag-
LC3 assay; 2) To study the inter-relationship between lipid accumulation and autophagy in the HSC activation;
and 3) To delineate the effect of ROS scavenging on lipophagy and lipid metabolism in HSC fibrogenic
response. By employing the novel HaloTag-LC3 assay which can detect specific autophagy structures and
high parameter metabolic flow cytometry (MetFlow), we will determine the state and role of autophagy in
primary HSCs in the context of HSC activation, HSC-hepatocyte interaction, and lipid metabolic profile. Once
completed, this study will provide a unique knowledge about the specific steps of autophagy involved in HSC
activation and provide a foundation for mechanism-based therapeutic tools against liver fibrosis."

Chronic intestinal inflammation is a major risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). It is well-
acknowledged that pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells play critical roles in almost every
developmental stage of inflammation-induced cancers including CRC; however, molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying chronic intestinal inflammation leading to tumorigenesis are still being uncovered.
Thus, understanding the mechanisms that control inflammatory responses of mucosal immune cells can be
beneficial for the treatment of inflammation-associated CRC.
 Our preliminary results have revealed the potential role of E3 ligase, gene related to anergy in lymphocyte
(Grail), in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and controlling carcinogenesis. Studies in both CRC murine
models and patients show a correlation between Grail expression in colon and reduction of intestinal
inflammation and tumor growth, suggesting the role of Grail in controlling intestinal inflammation and
importantly projecting Grail as a potential marker for diagnosis of CRC. We detected more severe CRC growth
in Grail knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice, which was associated with increased
expression of immune cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon. Moreover, Grail expression in
hematopoietic cells, particular in T cells, is important to control CRC. Remarkably, we detected a higher
number of interleukin (IL)-17 producing T follicular helper (Tfh)17 cells in colons of tumor-bearing Grail KO
mice and their percentage positively correlated with cancer severity. Similarly, we detected a higher number of
Grail-insufficient Tfh17 cells in patients with advanced CRC compared to patients with early stage of disease,
suggesting a new role for Tfh17 cells in promoting intestinal chronic inflammation and neoplastic diseases.
Interestingly, elevated numbers of Tfh17 cells in Grail KO mice were associated with the accumulation of Th17
and B cells, indicating that Tfh cells could engage in crosstalk with other pro-carcinogenic immune cells. We
propose a central hypothesis that Grail maintains intestinal homeostasis by controlling the activity of
pro-inflammatory mucosal Tfh17 cells.
In Aim 1, we will determine the link between Grail expression in Tfh cells and intestinal tumorigenesis. In Aim
2, we will examine the mechanism(s) whereby Grail deficient Tfh17 cells contribute to colon cancer
development. In both aims, we will utilize gene KO approaches and Bcl6/IL17/IFN-reporter mice.
 The implication from this work is significant since it will provide novel insights into the genetic link between
inflammation and cancer, define a new marker for early detection of inflammation-associated CRC, and guide
the development of effective colon cancer immunotherapies."

 Neurogenic osteoporosis is a devastating problem that is likely to impact 46,000
Veterans with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). It is typically associated with low impact fractures
of long bones and other medical comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately fifty percent of
all individuals with SCI will develop low impact fracture during their lifetime. The management of
osteoporosis related fractures can impose substantial economic burden on the health care
system, individuals with SCI and their families. Advancement in medical research clearly
indicated that neurogenic osteoporosis is linked to reduced loading and Vitamin D (Vit D)
deficiency. Our pilot work indicated that a simple rehabilitation paradigm targeting towards
evoking skeletal muscle hypertrophy may attenuate deterioration in trabecular bone parameters
after SCI. Evoked resistance training (RT) using surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation
(NMES) has been shown as a successful and feasible home-based approach to load skeletal
muscles after SCI. Our earlier results may imply long term compliance and adherence if
successfully applied in conjunction with a telehealth approach. In the present study, we propose
a simple home-based approach of using NMES RT in conjunction with oral Vit D
supplementation on trabecular bone quality in 20 Veterans with chronic SCI. Data will include
measurements of trabecular bone quality as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and bone biomarkers associated with the process of bone remodeling.
 Twenty participants with chronic (> 1-year post-injury) motor complete (AIS A and B) SCI
(18 to 65 years of age) will be randomly assigned into either NMES RT plus 2000IU of Vit D (10
participants) or passive movement plus 2000IU Vit D (10 participants) to participate in a
repeated measure design trial for 9 months. The NMES RT plus Vit D will undergo 4.5 months
of open kinematic chain resistance training followed by 4.5 months of closed kinematic chain
using simple rowing approach. This pilot work will have two main specific aims. Aim 1. To
determine the impact of home based NMES RT protocol plus oral Vit D supplementation
compared to passive movement plus oral Vit D on bone microarchitectural properties. Aim 2.
To determine the impact of home based NMES RT protocol plus oral Vit D compared to passive
movement and Vit D supplementation on biomarkers of bone formation and bone resorption.

10950358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a predominant cause of disability and death among children, leading to over
800,000 emergency department (ED) visits and 6,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Over 30% of children
presenting with head trauma are subjected to computed tomography (CT), the standard neuroimaging modality
in acute evaluations, to detect clinically meaningful TBIs. While CT is efficient, it exposes the pediatric brain to
ionizing radiation, thereby increasing potential for future cancer risk. Given the importance of identifying TBI
while also minimizing potential hazards, there is a need for safer and equally effective neuroimaging alternatives.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a radiation-free alternative to CT. Conventional MRI, although superior
in identifying certain intracranial injuries, is not frequently employed in acute TBI scenarios due to constraints
like scanner accessibility. However, recent advances have presented point-of-care, low-field brain MRI (POC
LF-MRI) systems as a potential paradigm-shifting neuroimaging modality. These systems are cost-effective,
portable, user-friendly, and have FDA clearance across all age groups. Notably, they enable bedside
neuroimaging, which is immensely beneficial for critically injured patients who can't be safely moved. This project
endeavors to bridge the existing knowledge gaps regarding the accuracy and feasibility of POC LF-MRI in
emergency and critical care for pediatric head traumas through a prospective, single-center, observational cohort
study of ED, hospitalized, and intensive care unit (ICU) children. Our research aims to (1) determine the accuracy
of POC LF-MRI for TBI compared to current clinical standard of care initial neuroimaging, (2) determine the
accuracy of POC LF-MRI for neuroradiographic injury progression on repeat neuroimaging, and (3) determine
feasibility metrics and balancing measures of POC LF-MRI, including order to scan time, scan duration,
incomplete scan proportion, and ED length-of-stay. In summary, our multidisciplinary team seeks to ascertain
the diagnostic accuracy and operational feasibility of POC LF-MRI, potentially transforming the neuroimaging
approach for pediatric trauma care. If successful, this could reduce radiation exposure risks, augment patient
safety, cut healthcare costs, and broaden neuroimaging access in acute care."

Before leaving high school, approximately 1 in 4 sexual minority adolescents will attempt to end their
own life; a rate that is nearly four times higher than their heterosexual peers. Social determinants in
the family context through parental acceptance or rejection is a major, consistent risk factor. Despite
progress in social acceptance of sexual minorities, in 2015 the Pew Research Council noted that 40%
of parents reported they would be upset or somewhat upset if their child came out as sexual minority.
Parental acceptance is a crucial upstream determinant for sexual minority adolescents’ wellness, but
remarkably scant research has focused on how parents get to acceptance; a vital unanswered
question impeding intervention development. The stall in research is partially due to the hard-to-reach
nature of the hidden population of parents of sexual minorities. The goal of this sequential
explanatory mixed methods project is to explore parents’ mental health and help-seeking behaviors
after their child comes out as sexual minority. With substantial work in social determinants of sexual
minority suicide prevention, our team is uniquely positioned to complete the proposed exploratory
study, which aligns with the developmental purposes of the R21 mechanism and responds directly to
the Notice of Special Interest in Research on Family Support and Rejection in the Health and Well-
Being of SGM Populations (NOT-OD-23-166). We aim to (1) compare four strategies to recruit
parents of sexual minorities to a brief, online survey about their mental health and help-seeking when
their child came out; (2) describe parents’ mental health after their child’s coming out and the help-
seeking resources parents sought for their mental health to navigate their child’s coming out; and (3)
explore pathways, facilitators, and barriers to parents’ help-seeking for individual-level and family-
level health needs after their child came out, including resources they wished they had and
suggestions to improve help-seeking resources. For Aim 1, we will examine the effectiveness of 4
strategies to recruit parents of sexual minority adolescents to complete an online survey to explore
mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, ambiguous loss) and help-seeking behaviors when their
child came out. For Aim 2, we will use the survey data from Aim 1 to examine correlates of mental
health symptomology, overall help-seeking behaviors, and among specific forms of formal (e.g.,
medical professional) vs. informal (e.g., pastoral professional) help-seeking behaviors. For Aim 3, we
will use semi-structured interviews to deeply explore parents’ experiences around their mental health
and help-seeking behaviors when their child came out to them. Using a family systems perspective to
explore the help-seeking needs of parents of sexual minorities opens new avenues for upstream
prevention and implementation studies to address health disparities for sexual minorities."

Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously referred to as
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, affects over 30% of the US population and is a
leading cause of cirrhosis, liver cancer, and need for liver transplantation. The Nonalcoholic
Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN), established in 2002, has focused on
characterizing the natural history of the different phenotypes of MASLD, evaluating novel
therapies to treat the condition, and conducting translational studies using a rich repository of
clinical, pathologic, imaging, and -omics data to advance knowledge. Since the last funding
cycle, the NASH CRN adult or pediatric clinical centers have enrolled 1575 participants into a
longitudinal database, including 617 newly enrolled individuals and undertaken two clinical trials:
the Losartan for Pediatric NAFLD (STOP-NAFLD) trial which was terminated early based on
DSMB recommendation and the Vitamin E Dose Ranging Study (VEDS), initiated in 2021,
which is 50% enrolled. During the current funding period, 219,404 total samples (serum,
plasma, liver tissue, DNA and cDNA), including samples for ~1,220 new patients, were added in
the NIDDK Biorepository, and 49,957 samples withdrawn for translational research using the
Ancillary Studies mechanism. The objectives of
the NASH CRN during the final funding period
are (a) to successfully complete the observational longitudinal study of NAFLD in adults and
children (NAFLD Database study, (b) complete the enrollment and follow-up of the VEDS
clinical trial (N=250) and to conduct new translational studies based on the clinical and archived
biospecimens from previous funding These studies may focus on (but not limited to) natural
history of NAFLD and NASH in children and adults, non-invasive assessment of disease
severity (e.g., proteomics, lipodimics, clinical prediction rules) and disease pathogenesis
(cytokine analyses, genome-wide association studies, tissue proteomics). Site-specific studies
include measurement of individual- and neighborhood-level social and structural determinants of
health (SSDOH) including geospatial variables, to determine their influence on MAFLD
development and progression and to evaluate whether the social and structural environment, as
measured by the social deprivation index, modifies the risk of germline genetic variants
(PNPLA3 and others) on disease severity and progression. Collectively, these studies are and
anticipated to address key knowledge gaps in MASLD diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
10983029,"In recent decades, Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), formerly known as
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), has become the most common chronic liver condition, leading to
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. This trend isn't confined to adults; children
and adolescents are also affected, increasing the need for liver transplants among young adults. Two decades
ago, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) established the Non-
Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) to advance clinical and translational
research in adult and pediatric MASLD. Their mission is to translate scientific findings from lab, clinical, and
population studies into practical applications, ultimately reducing MASLD incidence, slowing disease
progression, and improving clinical outcomes. Over 20 years, NASH CRN has led NAFLD research, creating
valuable databases, conducting randomized trials, and disseminating high-quality studies. Looking ahead, the
CRN will leverage its established infrastructure and accumulated knowledge to develop diagnostic tests,
biomarkers for disease progression, and safe, cost-effective NASH treatments. This renewal application aims
to complete ongoing NASH CRN studies: Database 3 (DB3) and Vitamin E Dosing Study (VEDS).
Furthermore, the Duke/Lurie Children's Memorial site proposes novel investigations focusing on accelerated
senescence to predict high-risk populations in pediatric and adult cohorts. The central hypothesis is that
patients prone to premature hepatocyte senescence are at greater risk of progressive liver degeneration,
severe hepatic fibrosis, and higher morbidity and mortality due to MASLD. These investigations draw from
recent research, utilizing existing data and biosamples while considering biological disparities to improve
outcomes in pediatric and adult populations. The goal is to deepen our understanding of MASLD and pioneer
innovative approaches for better disease management."

Role of Th2 cytokines in progenitor-mediated formation of tumor lymphatics
Lymph node metastasis, a common event in breast cancer, is a strong indicator of poor outcome due to
spread of nodal metastatic cells to distant organs which leads to mortality of patients. Metastatic burden in lymph
nodes directly correlates with the density of tumor lymphatic vessels. Outgrowth of these vessels is promoted by
bone marrow (BM) derived progenitors that co-express specific markers of lymphatic endothelial cells and M2-
type macrophages. This subset dubbed Myeloid-derived Lymphatic Endothelial Cells Progenitors (M-LECP) is
present in mice and patients with metastatic breast tumors but not in cancer-free individuals. We previously
showed in clinical breast cancers that density of lymphatic progenitors significantly correlates with tumor
lymphatic formation and metastases in lymph nodes. These data underscore the clinical significance of M-LECP
and the need to define their properties and the mechanisms that induce tumor lymphatics formation.
 We previously showed that M-LECP are M2-myeloid cells with lymphatic-specific markers whereas newly
formed lymphatic vessels express macrophage-specific markers. This misalignment between the markers and
their respective lymphatic/myeloid lineages is well-documented but unexplained. However, it can be explained
considering the traits of other BM progenitors known to adopt the phenotype of lineages targeted for repair, and
to employ fusion as the means to initiate the repair by inserting a trigger for cell proliferation. Fusion of BM
progenitors with targeted cells results in transfer of genomic material encoding for M2 myeloid markers which
explains their appearance in new structures. We reasoned that M-LECP, myeloid progenitors with partial
lymphatic identity, might similarly use BM-enabled fusogenic properties to expand lymphatic vessels. Our
preliminary data show that myeloid precursors treated with Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10 in vitro
differentiate into cells with combined M2-myeloid, lymphatic endothelial, and fusogenic phenotypes. This led to
the hypothesis that activation of Th2 pathways in M2-biased myeloid precursors co-regulates lymphatic
lineage-specific and fusogenic properties that collectively promote the ability of mature progenitors to
induce new lymphatic vessels. This hypothesis is supported by our data that demonstrate co-development of
M2, lymphatic, and fusogenic properties in differentiated M-LECP as well as multiple evidence for fusion of these
progenitors with lymphatic endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. We will test this hypothesis through the following
Specific Aims: (1) Determine in vivo the significance of Th2 pathways in M-LECP driven tumor
lymphangiogenesis; and (2) Determine whether fusogenic properties induced by Th2 factors and its regulator
TLR4 enable M-LECP to trigger tumor lymphatic formation. Significance: Th2 factors could play a paramount
role in enabling the lymphangiogenic function of M-LECP through fusion, a concept that provides a novel
framework for delineating generation of tumor lymphatic vessels. Exploration of this concept can lead to new
therapeutic targets paving the way for suppression of tumor lymphatics and inhibition of lymph node metastasis."

 Stroke is the leading cause of death and long-term disability in the United States. Up to 60% of stroke
survivors develop post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in the first year after stroke. PSCI is a significant
public health problem, as it can lead to a loss of independence, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare
costs. Despite its high prevalence, there is no established treatment for PSCI.
 New and innovative treatments are needed to improve cognitive function in stroke survivors with PSCI.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has shown
promise in improving cognitive function in a variety of conditions, including stroke. tDCS works by delivering a
weak electrical current through the scalp. This current can modulate the activity of neurons in the brain. While
tDCS has been shown to improve cognitive function in stroke survivors, the mechanism by which this effect is
mediated remains understudied. Although most existing studies have primarily focused on the neuronal effects
of tDCS, brain stimulation has a broad effect on a variety of brain cells and several studies report that tDCS can
increase resting cerebral blood flow both in animals and healthy individuals. However, whether tDCS is capable
of modulating hemodynamic responses in PSCI is significantly understudied.
 This project will investigate the potential of tDCS as a therapeutic intervention to improve neurovascular
coupling (NVC) and cognitive function in stroke survivors with PSCI. NVC is a critical mechanism that allows the
brain to match blood flow to metabolic demand. Current clinical evidence indicates that NVC impairment is
associated with PSCI.
 In Aim 1, I will comprehensively evaluate NVC responses in stroke survivors with and without cognitive
impairment, and compare their NVC responses to healthy sex and age matched controls. In Aim 2, I will conduct
a prospective sham-controlled clinical trial to determine if active tDCS leads to a significant improvement of NVC
responses in stroke survivors and whether these changes are associated with improvements in cognitive
performance. This project has the potential to develop a novel and effective treatment for PSCI. By using a
multimodal approach (simultaneous fNIRS-EEG), this proposal aims to investigate a potentially reversible
mechanism of cognitive decline following stroke and contributes to the advancement of neuroscience research
in vascular cognitive impairment."
10951411,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The proposed R36 dissertation research project will identify trends and multilevel determinants of
transitioning from injecting to smoking drugs (predominantly fentanyl and methamphetamine) in the San Diego-
Tijuana border region to inform service delivery for people who use drugs (PWUD). People who inject drugs
(PWID) face a high burden of overdose and infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, viral Hepatitis), especially in the
border region where binational disease transmission and drug trafficking create challenges for prevention
efforts. Some PWID in California, including San Diego, have recently shifted to smoking instead of injecting
opioids. Many syringe services programs (SSPs) offer safer smoking supplies (e.g., glass pipes, silicone
mouthpieces), the use of which has been linked to reduced sharing of injection and smoking equipment and
the use of ‘make-shift’ supplies like plastic bottles. However, some SSPs are struggling to meet the already
high and increasing demand for safer smoking supplies, especially in resource-constrained settings like
Mexico. We will use a Social Ecological Model-enhanced Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and
Sustainment (SEM-EPIS) framework to identify individual- (e.g., overdose experience), interpersonal- (e.g.,
peer norms), community- (e.g., access to SSP services), and structural-level (e.g., city policy) determinants of
transitioning from injecting to smoking heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine and examine internal (i.e., SSP)
and external (e.g., local public health and law enforcement factors) implementation considerations for
distributing safer smoking supplies. Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach guided by SEM-
EPIS, this dissertation will meet the following specific aims: Aim 1: (a) examine the extent to which people who
inject heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamine are transitioning to smoking and (b) identify the multilevel
determinants of these transitions; Aim 2: explore experiences with and perspectives on multilevel determinants
of transitioning from injecting to smoking among PWUD, including the use of safer smoking supplies; and Aim
3: investigate the internal (i.e., SSPs) and external implementation considerations for distributing safer smoking
supplies in the San Diego-Tijuana border region. We will leverage the ongoing binational La Frontera cohort
study (R01DA049644; n=612) and use latent transition analysis to identify PWUD with respect to patterns in
the frequency (low vs. high) of injection and smoking over time and multilevel determinants of these transitions
(Aim 1). We will then purposively sample ~30 PWUD and ~25 internal (i.e., SSP staff) and external key
informants (e.g., public health officials) to participate in Aim 2 and 3 qualitative interviews to further
contextualize and expand upon findings from Aim 1. Our proposed study will provide context around substance
use trajectories for PWID to enhance the implementation and scale-up of safer smoking supplies at a time
when evidence-based strategies are urgently needed to address the rising harms of injection drug use."

Autism is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental condition, affecting 1 in 36 youth. The annual cost in the U.S.
of autism was $223 billion in 2020 and is estimated to rise to $589 billion by 2030. Outcomes are poor and
care disparities and high rates of unmet service needs are common. Mental health services play a key role in
caring for autistic youth. There have been efforts to develop evidence-based interventions (EBIs) with the
potential to lessen the public health burden of autism. Yet, research indicates limited community EBI
penetration. Several gaps in work to date remain, including a focus on EBIs designed for community
implementation and those addressing multilevel barriers impeding EBI use. There is an urgent need to focus
on EBIs that improve mental health services for autism and optimize outcomes for this priority, complex
population. Executive functioning (EF) is a potent mechanism underlying autism and commonly co-occurring
mental health conditions. EF impairments (e.g., inflexibility, poor goal setting, poor planning) contribute to
negative outcomes spanning multiple areas (e.g., academic, vocational, health). Our work underscores the
impact of EF deficits on mental health services, including its transdiagnostic impact on the majority of children
served in this setting and its role as a barrier to psychotherapy engagement and progress. EF is responsive to
treatment, and mental health therapists cite a significant need and motivation for EF treatments, making EF
EBIs highly relevant for community mental health settings. However, EF EBIs have not been widely used and
tested in such settings. Autism EBIs, or those developed or adapted for autistic youth, have the potential to
enhance mental health services, in addition to improving service quality for the populations targeted (e.g.,
autism). This is due to the specific components and strategies incorporated into the EBI to enhance its impact
and fit. We propose a Hybrid Type 2 randomized trial examining the effectiveness and implementation of an
autism EF EBI (Unstuck and On Target) in community mental health settings. Unstuck and On Target is a
cognitive-behavioral EF intervention effective for autism. With NIMH funding (K23MH115100;), Unstuck and On
Target was systematically adapted for and tested in mental health settings, with a pilot test suggesting its
preliminary effectiveness, high fidelity, and use beyond autism. Findings have the potential to transform
implementation and service quality for the high priority population of autistic youth as well as youth generally.
Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an autism EBI (Unstuck and On Target), relative to a
non-autism transdiagnostic intervention (Unified Protocol for Children) for autistic youth. Aim 2. Evaluate
mediators of EBI training effects to confirm engaged change mechanisms of clinical and implementation
outcomes.
Aim 3. Explore the generalized effects of EBI training on reach and improved psychotherapy quality
with non-autistic youth."
10950572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Looking back to move forward: The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the role of
specific phenotypes, or subgroups of people based on a given characteristic, such as sex/gender,
APOE4 status, baseline AD biomarker levels, or polygenic hazard scores (PHS), on response to drug or
lifestyle interventions in existing Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials datasets. The precision medicine
approach of understanding the role of different phenotypes such as men vs. women, APOE4 carrier vs. non-
carrier, and AD polygenic hazard score in understanding Alzheimer’s risk and pathology has gained traction.
There is clearer recognition of sex/gender and APOE genotype differences in tau accumulation, cognitive
decline, and most recently in anti-amyloid immunotherapies. Findings from our studies began to hint at critical
sex/gender and genetic differences that reside in Alzheimer’s disease risk. Additionally, our team has
developed polygenic hazard scores using factors relevant to AD risk, such as sex/gender, tau PET burden, and
multiple risk genotypes.
 With tremendous strides in advanced technology and methods for genetic analyses, plasma-
based biomarkers, and harmonized brain imaging, in this proposal, we will examine the role of key
factors in clinical trials outcomes by leveraging existing Alzheimer’s clinical trials datasets from the
last 30 years. These clinical trials largely followed a harmonized set of outcomes focused on cognition and
function, with a large subset containing neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, both in derived and raw form. Data
from 14,602 participants who were randomized to treatment or placebo will be included in this proposal. All
datasets are de-identified and were collected within the guidelines of their respective institutional regulations.
This sample will be augmented as more data become available from newly completed trials over the project
period. Statistical models will include interaction terms for phenotype-by-arm on ADAS-Cog, PACC (Preclinical
Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite), CDR-SOB (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum-of-Boxes), ADCS-ADL
(Activities of Daily Living), in addition to brain MRI, PET, and plasma/CSF levels. Datasets will be analyzed
individually, and collectively in meta-analyses by grouping datasets according to primary mechanism of action.
All derived data from biofluids, genetics, and harmonized data will be openly shared with the scientific
community as a new resource."
10951436,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic pain affects over one third of the U.S. population and is a leading cause of
disability. Hence, there is pressing need for developing innovative, safe, and accessible non-opioid treatments
that effectively alleviate chronic pain. Mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) have emerged as widely used
mind-body interventions for chronic pain, focusing on enhancing present-moment attention, non-judgmental
awareness, and acceptance. Despite their popularity, the overall effects of MBTs on pain-related outcomes
remain modest. Recent mechanistic studies have shed light on the fact that mindfulness meditation does not
modulate the endogenous opioid system, a crucial player in pain relief. This revelation underscores the
potential for improving the efficacy of an MBT by integrating it with a safe, non-opioid intervention capable of
directly modulating endogenous opioid system. Open-label placebo (OLP), a non-deceptive placebo, presents
a promising, safe, and ethical intervention for chronic pain that can be combined with an MBT. Research has
indicated that placebo-induced analgesia is mediated by the release of endogenous opioids. Consequently,
there is a strong rationale to hypothesize that the combined application of an MBT and OLP treatment may
yield more potent and enduring effects in alleviating chronic pain than either treatment used in isolation. This
R34 study proposes a single-site three-arm randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability of combining Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), one of the most established and
extensively studied MBTs for chronic pain, with OLP treatment for individuals living with chronic pain. A total of
45 participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions for an 8-week trial with a 3-
month follow-up period: (1) MBSR-only; (2) OLP-only; and (3) a combination of MBSR and OLP treatment. The
feasibility of conducting the proposed trial will be determined by several metrics, including: (1) the rate of
participant enrollment, (2) participant retention from baseline to 3-month post-treatment follow-up, (3)
adherence to the MBSR program, (3) adherence to OLP treatment monitored using a smart pillbox and the
detection of urinary riboflavin tracer in mid- and post-treatment sessions; and (5) compliance with daily diary
assessments. The acceptability of combining MBSR and OLP treatment will be determined by self-report
ratings regrading (1) treatment satisfaction, (2) intervention effectiveness, (3) intervention convenience, (4)
side effects, (5) appropriateness of intervention and daily diary assessment length and frequency; and (6)
appropriateness of other study measures. The ultimate goal of this study is to advance chronic pain
management strategies for millions of individuals with chronic pain. The proposed study will serve as a pivotal
initial step in establishing procedures and strategies necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of combined
MBSR and OLP treatment in a future fully-powered multi-site clinical trial."
10950034,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During pregnancy, trophoblast cells from the placenta invade into the uterine spiral arteries and assist with the
remodeling necessary for adequate blood supply to the fetus. Cytotrophoblast, an undifferentiated and
proliferative cell subpopulation, can give rise to extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. EVT cells are terminally
differentiated trophoblast cells that invade into and restructure the uterine compartment. Impaired EVT cell
development leads to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including early pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine
growth restriction, and preterm birth. Human trophoblast stem (TS) can be captured, maintained in vitro under
specific conditions, and differentiated to ST as well as EVT cells. Regulatory mechanisms underlying human
TS cell self-renewal and early events in the differentiation of EVT cells have largely remained elusive. We have
utilized single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify cell populations and candidate regulators that arise
during EVT cell differentiation. A transcription factor termed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB)
was identified as a candidate regulator of early events in EVT cell differentiation. CEBPB is expressed in an
intermediate progenitor cell population arising during the early stages of EVT cell differentiation and in a
transitional compartment within EVT cell columns of the first trimester human placenta. Depletion of CEBPB in
human TS cells disrupts EVT cell differentiation. We hypothesize that CEBPB contributes to the regulation
of early events in EVT cell differentiation. To investigate actions of CEBPB on trophoblast cell lineage
development we will deplete CEBPB by using lentiviral-mediated shRNA in human TS cells and will evaluate
EVT cell differentiation with sc-RNAseq (Aim 1). To characterize CEBPB gene regulatory networks defining
EVT cell differentiation we will perform chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and single cell
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) at day 3 of EVT cell differentiation
(Aim 2). We will evaluate the bioavailability of CEBPB by investigating upstream transcriptional regulation of
CEBPB and post-translational modification (PTM) of CEBPB (Aim 3). The proposed research plan will provide
me with a body of experimental work necessary for publications and preliminary data for R-series grants. I will
utilize the expertise of the mentoring team as well as resources at the University of Kansas Medical Center for
cultivation of professional development skills. These skills will be improved through trainee mentoring, data
presentation, and scientific writing. During the R00 phase I will develop independence from my mentors by
identifying targets of CEBPB and investigating their contributions to invasive trophoblast cell development."
10950476,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the 4th most common female cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, despite
being preventable through HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination and early detection and treatment of
precancerous lesions. In high-income countries, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have been reduced
through HPV vaccination and screening based on cytology and HPV testing. However, in low- and middle-income
countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of cervical cancer remains high due to a lack of effective
programs for vaccination and screening. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends cervical
cancer screening using a nucleic acid test to detect high-risk HPV DNA, most low- and middle-income countries
have difficulty implementing HPV testing due to the high cost of tests, the need for lab infrastructure and trained
personnel, and long sample-to-answer times. There is an urgent need for novel, low-cost, accurate, and
accessible approaches to improve screening.
The goal of this project is to develop a point-of-care HPV DNA test that meets WHO goals for cervical cancer
screening in low- and middle-income countries by adapting and integrating two innovations: 1) an extraction-
free, multiplexed, isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay; and 2) a fully integrated nucleic acid amplification
and lateral flow detection platform called NATFlow. The resulting NATFlow HPV test will be affordable, rapid,
and simple to use at the point-of-care. We aim to: 1) adapt existing extraction-free, multiplexed, sample-to-
answer Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assays to detect eight high risk types of HPV on the
NATFlow platform and demonstrate technical functionality with 140 provider-collected clinical specimens; (2)
evaluate clinical performance of the NATFlow HPV test in Mozambique, first in 558 banked preserved samples
and then prospectively in 1,890 women undergoing cervical cancer screening at Hospital Central de Maputo and
surrounding community clinics; and (3) evaluate barriers/facilitators to cervical cancer screening using the
NATFlow HPV test in Mozambique.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary team based in the US, Mozambique, and Australia with extensive
collective experience in developing, evaluating, commercializing, and scaling new technologies to prevent
cervical cancer. We have a strong record of carrying out translational and implementation research in low- and
middle-income countries including Mozambique. Our industrial team has expertise in developing and translating
well-designed instrumentation and chemistries for point-of-care tests. Our team is ideally suited to adapt,
validate, and prepare to scale the NATFlow HPV test to accelerate global efforts to prevent cervical cancer."
10950450,"ABSTRACT: Older adults with moderate-to-severe depression symptoms (i.e., PHQ-9 scores ≥ 10) plus active
suicidal ideation (SI) and/or a history of attempt are at high risk for suicidal behaviors and death. Data suggest
that sleep-wake rhythm disruption could provide a modifiable target mechanism to improve depression
treatment outcomes. Controlled pilot data from a sample of older adults with serious mental illness show,
compared with treatment as usual (TAU), a behavioral approach called the Transdiagnostic Intervention for
Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) may improve sleep-wake rhythm stability and lead to more
sustained depression responses six-months later. We propose to confirm TranS-C’s target engagement (Aim
1) and efficacy for depression (Aim 2A) in older adults with depression symptoms plus high suicide risk. The
primary efficacy outcome is clinically significant: depression symptom response rates six-months post-
treatment (≥50% reductions in pre-treatment non-sleep GRID Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores). Key
secondary outcomes include SI rates six-months post-treatment (i.e., active SI with a method defined as
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ideation scores ≥ 3) and the incidence of a suicidal behavior
composite (i.e., escalating planning/attempt/suicide-related hospitalization) over six-months. Pilot data support
the hypothesized target engagement and efficacy, but as is typical of psychiatric treatments, we anticipate
treatment response variability. Exploratory Aim 3 is therefore to develop an algorithm indicating for whom
TranS-C is efficacious. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a three-site, double-blind, randomized
controlled trial (n=420) testing 8-weeks of TranS-C+TAU versus a contact-time matched active listening control
plus TAU (AL+TAU). Eligibility criteria include being 55+ years old, having PHQ-9 scores ≥ 10, Scale for
Suicide Ideation scores ≥ 3 or a past suicide attempt, and elevated sleep disturbances/impairment (PROMIS)
despite TAU with at least the minimum effective depression pharmacotherapy dose. The main target
engagement measure is actigraphy inter-daily stability post-treatment, an objective rhythm measure, which
correlated with depression symptom reductions six-months after TranS-C in our pilot. Therapists will be
centrally-trained and carefully monitored for fidelity. Assessments pre-, post-, and 6-months post-treatment
include diagnostic interviews, self-report measures, and a week of actigraphy/sleep diary. Weekly during the
treatment phase, and monthly six-months thereafter, participants will receive calls from blinded assessors
charting treatment effects and actively monitoring for safety. Participants will also wear wrist actigraphy in the
treatment phase to objectively track changes in sleep-wake patterns. Analyses seek to confirm if TranS-C has
efficacy for sustained depression responses; and to evaluate mediation via the target/alternative mechanisms.
Moderator analyses will produce an algorithm for use in future precision treatment studies. This study will have
an impact by confirming TranS-C’s antidepressant mechanism, efficacy, and clarifying who benefits the most."

The central mission of the proposed Personalizing Outcomes of Nephrolithiasis in Youth (PONY) P20 Center
is to generate knowledge that improves outcomes for youth with nephrolithiasis though collaborative research
among established and Early-Stage Investigators. To achieve this mission, this proposal strengthens
partnerships among Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Children’s Wisconsin, and Lurie Children’s Hospital of
Chicago. The Administrative Core will draw upon the resources of each institution, the robust infrastructure of
the Pediatric KIDney Stone Care Improvement Network (PKIDS), the perspectives of the Kidney Stone
Engagement Core, and data generated by the NIDDK-supported Urinary Stone Disease Research Network
(USDRN) to overcome structural barriers that have impeded the generation of impactful new knowledge and
have prevented the entrance and continued success of new investigators into benign urologic research.
In the proposed PONY P20 Center, we address critical structural and scientific barriers that have impeded
strengthening the evidence base for management of pediatric nephrolithiasis. The Administrative Core will
provide the project management support to ensure the success of the proposal. This support includes providing
resources and infrastructure to complete the Research Project and facilitating the continued trajectory of Early-
Stage Investigators towards future independent R01 funding. Aim 1 of the Administrative Core is to support the
Research Project. The Administrative Core will create opportunities for Drs. Ellison and Chu to lead the execution
of the Research Project through operational and logistical support as well as data access. Aim 2 of the
Administrative Core is to accelerate the research careers of Early-Stage Investigators and enhance the clinical
impact of their research. The Administrative Core will integrate the research project into the existing
organizational structure, relationships, and resources of PKIDS, which includes 30 institutions in North America.
The Administrative Core will actively disseminate the results of the Research Project and promote their
implementation into clinical care throughout PKIDS, thereby expediting and enhancing the impact of these
findings. PKIDS will also provide the scientific environment to support the R01 applications led by Drs. Ellison
and Chu that will arise from the Research Project. Aim 3 of the Administrative Core is to disseminate knowledge
generated by the PONY P20 Center to the CAIRIBU community and the broader research base. The
Administrative Core will access bidirectional channels created by the U54 Interactions Core to share and receive
new ideas and knowledge with the CAIRIBU community and the broader benign urologic research base. Overall,
the Administrative Core will facilitate the generation of knowledge that addresses critical priorities identified by
youth with nephrolithiasis and will accelerate the career of early-stage investigators who will be leaders in benign
urological research."
10953811,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RESEARCH PROJECT
Nephrolithiasis is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent symptomatic events that are both painful and
expensive. Despite concerning epidemiological trends showing a higher incidence of disease and more frequent
recurrence rates in youth aged 21 years and younger as compared to adults, a strong evidence base upon which
to develop individualized management strategies for youth with nephrolithiasis is lacking. The overarching
objective of the Personalizing Outcomes of Nephrolithiasis in Youth (PONY) P20 Center is to strengthen patient-
centered knowledge and improve personalized management of youth with nephrolithiasis. We will generate new
knowledge about two distinct but related common clinical scenarios: 1) the natural history of non-obstructive
kidney stones, and 2) the post-operative patient-reported experience following ureteroscopy surgery for stones.
To achieve this mission, we will leverage ongoing partnerships among Dr. Gregory Tasian (PI at Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr Jonathan Ellison (early-stage investigator at Children’s Wisconsin), Dr. David Chu
(early-stage investigator at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago), and Dr. Jing Huang (biostatistician at Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia). Specifically, this project will be supported by the resources generated by Dr. Tasian’s
research program, in particular the robust infrastructure of the Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care
Improvement Network and data generated two NIDDK-supported Urinary Stone Disease Research Network
studies: the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) trial and the STudy to Enhance uNderstanding
of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS). In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a risk prediction model for
symptomatic stone events for youth with non-obstructive stones. Model development will leverage PKIDS trial
data, which will be further augmented by linkage with the PCORnet common data model, providing an additional
18 months of follow-up beyond the PKIDS trial. The prediction model will be externally validated among youth in
the PUSH trial. We expect to evaluate this prediction tool in a future R01-supported hybrid implementation-
effectiveness trial within the PKIDS Care Improvement Network comparing the prediction tool against usual care
for non-obstructing nephrolithiasis. In Aim 2, we will apply group-based trajectory modeling to differentiate distinct
longitudinal trajectory groups of post-operative pain intensity, pain interference, and urinary symptoms following
ureteroscopic surgery for stones. These unique trajectory groups will identify subgroups of youth at high risk for
severe pain and urinary symptoms after surgery. We will determine the predictors and consequences of group
membership to help with risk stratification. This modeling approach will be applied first to youth in the PKIDS
trial, then repeated among youth in STENTS. We expect to leverage our findings in a future R01-supported
pragmatic trial comparing adaptive interventions against usual care that implement individualized pre-operative
strategies to enhance post-operative recovery and symptoms. This project will enrich the evidence base for youth
with nephrolithiasis and support career trajectories for two early-stage instigators to carry this evidence forward."

The primary training objective of the K99 phase of this K99/R00 application is to provide the candidate with
training in state-of-the-art electrophysiology techniques in preparation for a career as an independent investigator
in the field of alcohol research. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that decision-making malfunctions
in alcohol use disorder (AUD) are caused by concurring neural activity changes in multiple key brain regions that
serve to route the decision-making process through different circuits. To address this hypothesis, this award will
use high-density neural probes to record the electrical activity of hundreds of neurons across many brain regions
in head-fixed mice during the decision to drink. The candidate will obtain the necessary training in the use of
these neural probes to generate large neural recording data sets that can be used to directly observe changes
in the neural circuits underlying malfunctioning decision-making in AUD. To obtain this necessary training, the
candidate will work with leading researchers already using these tools in the International Brain Laboratory
collaboration and attend a training workshop. The candidate’s career development will also be furthered by
publishing results in high-impact journals, attending conferences, and attending relevant on-campus seminars.
The proposed mentoring team includes Dr. Christopher Lapish, Dr. Woody Hopf, Dr. Susan Sangha, Dr. Kenneth
Harris, and Dr. David Kareken. These individuals are experts in systems and computational neuroscience, the
neural circuitry of fear and reward, alcohol research, head-fixed mouse studies, and sex as a biological variable.
The long-standing collaborative research environment at IUPUI will provide the candidate with the necessary
resources to complete the aims as outlined in this proposal. During the end of the K99 phase of the award, the
candidate will seek out a faculty position as an independent investigator to begin at the start of the R00 phase
of the award. In this new position, the studies will expand to include the neural correlates of aversive stimuli in
order to better understand the decision to continue drinking alcohol in the face of negative consequences. This
work will lead to R01 grant applications by the candidate related to further recordings and interventions in neural
circuits to treat malfunctioning decision-making. By identifying changes in the neural circuits underlying
malfunctioning decision-making, this research will guide future studies that seek to develop novel treatments for
those people suffering from or at risk for AUD. This award will lay the foundation for an independent career in
alcohol research which has the potential to greatly improve the lives of people impacted by this disease."
10949273,"Project Summary
Polygenic scores (PGS), constructed by common variants identified through large genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), are effective tools in research and clinical applications. However, the interpretation of the
functional roles of PGS—that involve hundreds to even thousands of common variants—in uncovering the
specific components of a phenotype trait or a disease outcome is challenging. This will further obscure the
interpretations of downstream analysis in identifying the causal relationships between risk factors and diseases.
The proposed project aims to address a critical need to enhance the PGS applicability in investigating disease
etiologies using cohort and family-based studies, integrating diverse sources of information including multi-omics
data and environmental exposures. In particular, the work will 1) Develop a machine learning approach and its
hypothesis testing framework to integrate trait-associated SNPs, multi-omics data, and summary-level statistics
of the trait to model the mediating mechanisms underlying genetic associations. Then construct partitioned SNP
sets or partitioned PGS (pPGS), with each partitioned component representing distinct functional regulatory
pathways linked to the GWAS trait. 2) Develop likelihood-based methods utilizing multi-trait PGS to estimate the
causal effects of multiple correlated exposures on an index disease in family-based studies, correcting for biases
from assortative mating and population stratification. 3) Identify heterogeneous causal effects of exposures using
partitioned SNP sets and pPGSxE interactions in leading causes of mortality, including cardiovascular diseases
and cancers; and identify the causal relationships of multiple maternally-mediated exposures and biomarkers on
childhood diseases, including autism spectrum disorders and orofacial clefts, through multi-ethnic case-parent
trio studies. Finally, the developed methods and results will be disseminated through user-friendly software tools
and a summary statistics database. This work will help researchers better utilize various genetic markers, rich
omics data, and environmental variables for a more comprehensive and unbiased understanding of how
molecular changes contribute to disease causalities, ultimately enhancing public health through better
interventions and treatments.
The candidate will receive training from a mentoring team of globally recognized experts in the fields of statistical
genetics, machine learning, genomics, epidemiology, and subject-matter expertise in cardiovascular diseases,
cancer, and mental health; supported by a vibrant intellectual environment at Johns Hopkins University with
seminars, collaborations, career development resources, and advanced coursework. This award will allow the
candidate to gain critical skills in research, mentoring, communication, and leadership that will ensure success
in her long-term goal of establishing an independent research program, focused on pioneering the development
of innovative computational methods to advance human health through large-scale dataset integration."
10950024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic use is linked to increased risk for the onset or relapse of inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid
arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but the underlying basis for this and the gut-joint axis in regulation of
both inflammatory and viral arthritis are not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to define how antibiotic-
mediated gut dysbiosis and loss of certain short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria alters local
responses in the gut and distal inflammation in the joint. Heterogeneity of tissue resident synovial macrophages
and fibroblasts have been described in rheumatoid arthritis but little is known about the cellular context and it
has been virtually unexplored in the context of viral arthritis. I hypothesize the antibiotic-mediated gut dysbiosis
and associated loss of certain SCFA-producing bacteria alters local intestinal epithelial responses to increase
gut permeability and the priming of systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Furthermore, I hypothesize that this
is linked to altered epigenetic and transcriptional programs in resident synovial cell populations that enhance
synovial inflammation and worsen arthritis severity. Additionally, I propose that supplementation with exogenous
SCFA can regulate these changes to temper the severity of arthritis. Using a combination of functional studies
and sequencing technologies including high resolution spatial transcriptomics and ATAC-sequencing, this
proposal will address gaps in knowledge related to how SCFA-producing bacteria shape intestinal epithelial cell
responses to modulate the severity of viral arthritis (Aim 1) and how antibiotic-mediated gut dysbiosis affects
tissue resident synovial macrophages and fibroblasts to enhance inflammation in Chikungunya viral arthritis (Aim
2). The elucidation of altered pathways may stimulate novel therapeutic approaches for modulation of gut
dysbiosis and improved clinical management of viral and inflammatory arthritis.
This proposal describes a 5-year training and mentorship plan to prepare the PI, Fang Roseanne Zhao, M.D.,
Ph.D., to become an independent physician-scientist principal investigator. The aims of the mentored research
project described provide the framework for Dr. Zhao obtain additional expertise in gut immunology, synovial cell
profiling, next generation sequencing, and bioinformatic skillsets in order to effectively study the complexity of
the microbiome and gut-joint link. Washington University School of Medicine is an ideal training environment with
a longstanding commitment to the training of physician-scientists, outstanding resources, expertise to complete
the proposed research. During the 5-year period of support provided by this K08 award, Dr. Zhao will continue
her career development through relevant coursework, collaborative learning, and mentors to allow her to obtain
foundational knowledge and transition to her own independent research program as a successful physician
scientist studying modulation of arthritis by the host-microbiome interface."
10950095,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Timely and accurate clinical decision-making is critical for the quality of healthcare delivery, impacting everyone
from individual patients to entire public health systems. Clinicians often raise questions in their practice for
decision-making (averaging two questions for every three patients seen), but rarely have time or resources to get
evidence-based answers, leading to sub-optimal patient care decisions and even diagnostic error. This is
particularly true for emergency departments (EDs) with chaotic, time-pressured, and high-stakes decision
environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven question-answering (QA) systems can fill this gap, by providing
real-time answers and predictive analytics, aiding clinicians in timely, accurate decision-making. Addressing this
critical need, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), offers a transformative approach to understand complex
questions and generate human-like responses. Despite their promise, two critical issues hinder the adoption of
LLMs in clinical practice. The foremost challenge is their unreliability. LLMs can generate incorrect medical
information, which has devastating outcomes such as misdiagnosis. The second hurdle is the lack of transparency.
Many of these systems produce answers without providing reasoning and justification, making their responses
less useful and undermining the trust of clinicians. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and validate
a clinically reliable and transparent LLM-based QA system and translate it into a clinical chatbot for clinical
decision support, providing clinicians with accurate evidence-based information in high-stakes scenarios like EDs.
During the K99 phase, I will develop novel clinically accurate LLMs (CliniGPT) with multi-modality clinical data
guided by the clinical-specific pre-training and fine-tuning framework (Aim 1). During the R00 phase, I will develop
and validate the retrieval-augmented medical QA (CliniQARet) framework, to guide CliniGPT in generating
reliable answers to clinical questions in the ED setting (Aim 2). Using the best model from Aim 1 and Aim 2, I will
build the clinical chatbot following user-centered principles, delivering evidence-based, timely support for common
ED scenarios including chest pain, headache, fever, and abdominal pain, to enhance decision-making. I will
develop and validate the software in a simulated EHR environment using real patient data and recruiting ED
clinicians (Aim 3). The expected outcomes are a real-time, user-centered ED clinical chatbot; open-source
clinically accurate LLMs; an open-source reliable and trustworthy clinical QA framework; an open-source
framework for pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluating clinical LLMs focusing on reliability; an open-source
framework of constructing and integrating multi-modal clinical datasets to enrich and ground the system’s clinical
knowledge. During the K99 phase, the PI will be mentored by experts in clinical NLP and LLM, emergency
medicine, and clinical informatics, and requires additional training in clinical, evidence-based and emergency
medicine. This application will provide the necessary training to supplement the PI’s expertise in clinical NLP and
clinical medicine and help her transition into an independent career in biomedical data science."
10949836,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support my long-term career goal of testing whether
the mental and physical health of youth, particularly those from historically marginalized groups, improves when social
norms encourage widespread promotion of body positive messages. Stigma in its many forms has been identified as
a fundamental cause of health problems, but weight stigma has received relatively less attention than other types of
stigma. For larger bodied people, weight stigma is associated with depression, anxiety, substance use, low self-
esteem, and poor body image, increased social isolation, adverse academic outcomes, disordered eating, reduced
physical activity, and increased overweight/obesity. High rates of adolescent obesity disproportionately impact Latinx
youth in the U.S. putting them at increased risk for poor health outcomes. Social media offers untapped potential to
promote healthy norms around body size and shape. To leverage youth’s heavy engagement with social media and
its ability to shape norms, I am proposing a social media intervention designed to positively influence adolescents’
views of those living in larger bodies, increase the likelihood that adolescents promote positive content about body
size and shape, and discourage adolescents from engaging in harmful actions towards others because of their weight.
The limited research on social media interventions to promote body positivity (positive feelings about body size and
shape) has involved a one-time intervention exposure and has largely been done with White, female adult samples.
My proposed research will address these gaps by studying Latinx youth of all genders who will receive multiple
exposures to body positive messages via Instagram. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) use qualitative
methods to understand Latinx youth’s view on body positive messages to inform the development of an Instagram
body positivity campaign, (2) develop an Instagram body positivity campaign to increase body positivity among Latinx
adolescents, and (3) conduct a pilot RCT to assess the impact of a body positivity Instagram campaign tailored to
Latinx youth on weight stigma and mental health. For Aim 1, I will conduct 20 interviews with youth about body
positivity to identify key themes that will inform development of a campaign to promote body positivity among Latinx
youth. In Aim 2, I will develop 20 campaign messages and pre-test those messages with 100 Latinx adolescents to
select messages for use in the pilot RTC. In Aim 3, 114 Latinx adolescents will engage with a study campaign
(intervention or control) for 4 weeks and complete baseline and follow-up surveys. My training goals will support my
research efforts including the development of expertise in (1) weight stigma and evidence-based strategies to
promote body positivity, (2) applying principles of community-engaged participatory research to develop culturally
relevant interventions, (3) developing health communication interventions using social media, and (4) designing and
analyzing longitudinal randomized-controlled trials. My training will be enhanced with professional development
opportunities, institutional resources, and exceptional mentorship. This K01 will allow me to establish an independent
research program aimed at diminishing the toll of weight stigma."
10950387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this research is to determine how lipid metabolism supports oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells. Leukemia stem cells (LSC) are responsible for
relapse in AML, and a major goal in the field is identifying novel ways to eradicate AML-LSC. Recently,
lipids have been identified as essential metabolic substrates for AML-LSC; however, the mechanisms
linking lipids and OXPHOS are not known. To address this, I have determined relapse-specific candidate
genes using RNA-Sequencing data from a cohort of pediatric AML patients characterized through the
Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) study. The results
suggest that fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is repurposed to drive heme biosynthesis and fuel OXPHOS in AML
relapse. In this K38 StAARTS application, I will test this hypothesis by studying lipid metabolism and
OXPHOS in vitro with AML cell lines and in vivo using pediatric patient-derived xenografts. Aim 1 will use
stable isotope metabolite tracing experiments to determine if palmitate is a key carbon source for heme in
AML cells with LSC properties. Then, Aim 2 will test the effects of a high-fat diet on the growth and
aggressiveness of pediatric AML-LSC xenografts obtained through St. Jude’s Public Resource Of Patient-
derived and Expanded Leukemias (PROPEL) program. AML-LSC from Aim 2 will also be tested for the
effects of a high-fat diet on OXPHOS activity and heme-containing protein content using comprehensive
proteomic profiling through the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute’s Metabolomics and Proteomics Core.
The results from these studies will provide a mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and OXPHOS in
AML-LSC and have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. My Mentor team, Institutional
Environment and Career Development Plan, together with my clinical Hematology-Oncology fellowship,
will provide a superb training experience that will ensure the success of this research and prepare me for
a future transition to independence as a Pediatric Hematology-Oncology physician scientist."
10950386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic cough affects millions of people in the US and around the world, and has a significant negative impact
on quality of life, especially when it is refractory to treatment. Existing treatments for chronic cough can help,
but up to 50% of patients have persistent cough symptoms despite receiving standard treatments. Identifying
effective treatments for refractory chronic cough aligns with the mission of the NHLBI to advance the treatment
of lung and related diseases, enhancing “the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more
fulfilling lives.” A promising approach to treating refractory chronic cough is laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation,
which changes sensory input to the larynx with the goal to break the vicious cycle of cough causing laryngeal
irritation and increased sensitivity, which in turn causes more cough. Chronic cough is associated with
abnormalities in laryngeal sensorimotor cortex activity in areas that can be modulated by the use of laryngeal
vibrotactile stimulation. In preliminary findings, the use of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation was associated with
an improvement in cough-related quality of life and cough counts, and participants expressed interest in
increased laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation dosing. In Aim 1 of this proposal, dose refinement for vibrotactile
stimulation will be performed, using a series of escalating dose conditions. The most favorable dosing will be
identified, taking into account acceptability and tolerability for participants as well as changes in cough-related
quality of life and objective cough counts. In Aim 2, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to
measure the effect of 4 weeks of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation use on key cough outcomes. Data on
acceptance of randomization and retention will be collected. Changes in cough-related quality of life, cough
severity, and objective cough counts will be measured. These aims will be conducted by a multidisciplinary
research team with expertise in pulmonology, laryngeal physiology and function, clinical trials, biostatistics, and
medical devices, in partnership with an extensive and engaged network of referring providers. Completion of
these aims will provide necessary and sufficient information about the feasibility and acceptability of a
subsequent randomized clinical trial to definitively test the effect of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation on
refractory chronic cough. In addition, the proposed project will provide a preliminary estimate of the effect of
laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation on cough-related quality of life as well as an estimate of the resources needed
to conduct a subsequent definitive clinical trial. This study has the potential to lead to a non-invasive, portable,
repeatable treatment free of systemic side effects for the millions of people who suffer from refractory chronic
cough."
10950463,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of e-cigarettes in the U.S. in 2007, there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence
of e-cigarette use among adolescents. These high prevalence rates have been driven, in part, by beliefs that e-
cigarettes are less harmful than combustible cigarettes. Unfortunately, mounting evidence indicates that e-
cigarettes pose significant health risks. E-cigarettes also contain nicotine, which can interfere with normal brain
development. Because it is still developing, the adolescent brain is more vulnerable to the negative effects of
nicotine exposure, putting adolescent e-cigarette users at greater risk of nicotine dependence as well as
reduced impulse control and deficits in attention and cognition. Thus, although many had hoped that e-
cigarettes would serve as a smoking cessation tool, they may, in fact, be ushering in a new generation of
individuals dependent on nicotine. Therefore, we face an urgent need to promote e-cigarette cessation among
adolescents. Unfortunately, the empirical literature on e-cigarettes has not been able to keep pace with their
rapid increase in popularity. These knowledge gaps combined with the unique challenges of working with
adolescent e-cigarette users have hindered the development of empirically supported e-cigarette cessation
interventions for this population, and we currently lack targeted e-cigarette cessation interventions that are
developmentally appropriate, grounded in empirically supported theories of behavior change, and acceptable
to adolescents. To create such interventions, formative research is needed to better understand the different
types of adolescent e-cigarette users based on their motivations for use rather than patterns of use.
Identification of such a typology is critical as each type will have distinct cues, use patterns, beliefs, and
preferences resulting in the need for type-specific interventions. Moreover, greater adolescent engagement is
needed to ensure that the content of these interventions as well as the messaging surrounding them are
acceptable to adolescents and take into account their perceptions of their own use. A mixed methods approach
will be utilized to gather formative data on types of adolescent e-cigarette users and interventional targets
specific to each type to inform the development of tailored cognitive behavioral e-cigarette cessation
interventions for each type. A sample of 1200 high school students who have used an e-cigarette in the past
month will be recruited. Self-report data will be used to identify e-cigarette user types based on motivations for
use as well as cognitive and behavioral correlates of each type. Focus groups with users of each type as well
as students who have successfully quit using e-cigarettes will provide further information about cognitive and
behavioral intervention targets and cessation needs and preferences. The findings of this project will fill critical
knowledge gaps that will result in the development of cognitive behavioral e-cigarette cessation treatment
protocols specifically designed for adolescent e-cigarette users and tailored to their specific use type that will
be evaluated in future clinical trials."
10950411,"ABSTRACT:
Down syndrome (DS), the chromosomal disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Tri21), presents many
neurological conditions, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability worldwide. Although
some human chromosome 21 (HSA21) genes have been identified as key contributors to some of these
pathologies, the mechanisms that link the triplication of HSA21 genes to most DS-related diseases remain
largely unknown. Many DS-related neurological conditions are caused by a dysregulated GABAergic system.
Excessive GABAergic functions impair synaptic plasticity and memory formation in DS mouse models. DS
mouse models exhibit synaptic plasticity deficits, which are rescued by GABA receptor antagonists. Our
primary goal is to discover the molecular underpinnings that cause human GABAergic dysregulation, which
will provide critical knowledge for understanding the pathogenesis of DS-related human brain disorders, and
for developing effective human treatments. Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is a major cause
of the increased GABAergic synapses and enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission in the neocortex of DS
mouse models. Normalization of DSCAM dosage rescued the excessive GABAergic innervation on pyramidal
neuron soma and axon initial segments and prevented the increase in postsynaptic inhibitory current
frequency. DSCAM is expressed in GABAergic neurons as well as other neuronal types and is overexpressed
in the brains of DS patients and DS mouse models. Human genetics studies have shown strong associations
between DSCAM variants and cognitive abilities. These findings raise the possibility that DSCAM
overexpression might explain the dysregulation of GABAergic synapses in DS. However, whether the HSA21
dosage and overexpression of DSCAM is causative of GABAergic neuron dysfunction in humans remains to be
studied. We hypothesize that DSCAM triplication, resulting from trisomy 21, causes dysregulated
GABAergic interneuron development and synaptogenesis in human trisomy 21 cell models. To test this
hypothesis, we will use GABAergic neurons derived from control and trisomy 21 human embryonic stem cells.
The combined expertise of the Smith and Ye labs is ideally suited for the proposed study. The proposed study
is significant because its successful accomplishment will identify the molecular regulators of the GABAergic
system in human neurons. This knowledge will offer insights into the development of therapeutic treatments
that target DS-related conditions that are caused by dysregulated GABAergic synapses. It will also provide
molecular and cellular insights into many neurological disorders, such as other intellectual disabilities, epilepsy,
ASD, and neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.

10949497,"Every year, more than 75,000 children and 750,000 adults in the United States are admitted to an
Intensive Care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis. Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) has a high
morbidity and mortality rate and unfortunately there are no methods to predict, prevent, or treat SA-AKI.
Emerging evidence implicate the role of complement activation as a key driver of SA-AKI development. We
have shown that urine complement factor Ba is associated with incident AKI in both critically ill children and
adults with sepsis. However, whether complement activation is involved in SA-AKI pathogenesis in critically ill
children and adults is unknown. We hypothesize that urine Ba elevation temporally precedes development of
SA-AKI and associates with urine cellular changes. This proposal will examine the association between urine
Ba and AKI in critically ill patients with sepsis. First, we will prospectively enroll critically ill children with sepsis
and longitudinally obtain urine Ba levels to determine the association between urine Ba levels and severe AKI
outcomes, and then validate these findings in a large multicenter trial of pediatric sepsis (Aim 1). We will
validate this association through two biorepositories from clinical trials in critically ill septic adults (Aim 2). This
will determine when urine Ba peaks and identify cutoff values and identification of an ideal window to study use
of therapeutic trials of factor B inhibition in the future. Finally, we will measure complement deposition on shed
tubular epithelial cells in the urine to determine if complement activation is occurring in the kidney (Aim 3).
 As an Assistant Professor in Pediatric Critical Care with a strong publication record, I am establishing
myself in the field of critical care nephrology. A K23 Career development award would support the following
research goals: 1) strengthen the evidence implicating the complement cascade’s role in SA-AKI development;
2) identify a potential therapeutic window to stratify patients for treatment with a complement therapeutic in
future R01 proposals; 3) obtain mechanistic insight discriminating systemic versus localized kidney
complement activation. My career development plan includes dedicated time to 1) train and gain experience in
conducting patient-oriented research and clinical trials; 2) work with a multidisciplinary team of experts in Adult
and Pediatric Nephrology, Emergency/Critical Care, and Biostatistics; 3) pursue training in biostatistics and
biomarker analytics; 4) gain skills in interpretation of complement quantification methods; 5) develop
professional skills including manuscript preparation, grant writing, presentation skills, etc.; and 6) establish the
foundation for an independent research career aimed at improving outcomes for critically ill patients with SA-
AKI. My training environment is outstanding with mentorship from Dr. Kendrick, an adult nephrologist with
clinical research expertise and a strong record of successful mentoring, and co-mentors Drs. Thurman and

The long-term objective of the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) initiative is
to efficiently translate advances in neuroscience into treatments for adults and children with neurological
disorders through partnerships with government, academia, private foundations, and industry. The goal of this
proposal is to establish and operate a Gene Therapy Consortium (GTC) that provides expert advice on clinical
trials of gene therapies for ultra-rare adult and pediatric disorders conducted within NeuroNEXT. The GTC will
consist of members with expertise in gene-based and gene-targeted therapies, ultra-rare and rare diseases, and
clinical trial planning and execution, with particular emphasis on first-in-human or first-in-disease trials, small
clinical trials, and adaptive trial designs. The GTC will be organized and managed by the NeuroNEXT Clinical
Coordination Center (CCC) and will provide advice as requested for gene therapy proposals. The GTC members
will support investigators applying to NeuroNEXT in all phases starting at the conception and planning phases
and continuing for funded proposals through implementation, analysis and reporting for gene therapy trials within
NeuroNEXT.
 Ultra-rare diseases affect less than or equal to 6,000 people. Many rare diseases, including ultra-rare diseases,
have no FDA-approved therapeutic available and have an identified genetic origin. The NINDS supports gene-
based therapy research through the Ultra-Rare Gene-based Therapy (URGenT) program. NINDS announced
that they will expand the URGenT program to support the conduct of gene-based therapy clinical trials for ultra
rare neurological diseases. Gene therapy proposals will be submitted to the NINDS using the URGenT program
synopsis form.
 NeuroNEXT will serve as a clinical trial network for the conduct of early clinical trials of gene therapy for ultra-
rare pediatric and adult neurological disorders. NeuroNEXT is currently comprised of 13 clinical sites, a Clinical
Coordinating Center (CCC), and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). A central goal of NeuroNEXT is to facilitate,
from initial conception through final analysis, high-quality early-phase clinical trials and biomarker multisite
studies with clear go/no-go decisions by providing efficient methodological, organizational, statistical, and
logistical support. Aim 1 is to establish a collaborative and accessible Gene Therapy Consortium (GTC) with
members with diverse expertise to support investigators in developing and conducting gene-based and gene-
targeted therapies trials within NeuroNEXT. Aim 2 is to establish and implement an efficient process for gene
therapy proposals to move from concept to design, implementation, analysis and reporting, in collaboration with
the NINDS NeuroNEXT program officials and the NeuroNEXT Data Coordination Center (DCC)."
10953880,"Project Summary Abstract
One in 20 pregnant women in the United States have clinically severe disordered eating (DE)
symptoms during pregnancy, such as intentional vomiting, food restriction, and binge eating. DE
during pregnancy is related to serious mental, emotional, and physical impairments, as well as
pregnancy complications. Specifically, DE greatly increases the risk of miscarriage,
hemorrhage, severe/prolonged vomiting, preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects,
impairments, and death, and doubles risk of severe anxiety and depression. DE
disproportionally impacts women during reproductive years, and pregnant and postpartum
women face unique challenges in this period, such as societal pressures (e.g., fear of gaining
“too much” baby weight, pressure to lose weight quickly after pregnancy), along with pregnancy
symptoms (e.g., difficulty eating, bodily changes, morning sickness). These vulnerabilities
exacerbate DE, and risk of devastating health and pregnancy outcomes for mothers and infants.
This proposal will modify our personalized self-guided system to identify treatment targets to
ultimately address the unique presentation of the symptoms that drive DE in pregnant and
postpartum women. There are currently no personalized digital self-guided interventions for this
high-risk population. Thus, this supplement is to develop and modify a personalized, self-
guided, digital intervention to address DE in pregnant and postpartum women. First, using
idiographic models, we aim to identify the frequency of the most problematic symptoms that
drive DE in this high-risk population (N=60). Second, we aim to modify and test if our digital
therapeutic to address treatment targets personalized for pregnant and postpartum women
reduces DE and increases their quality of life. Our highly novel methods are packaged within a
digitalized program delivered directly to these high-risk women to intervene on the most
problematic symptoms in a personalized manner within their day-to-day life, to improve access
to care. This proposal is in-line with the parent grant, to provide the growth of our current
mentorship training and research experiences for students, and support three early career
researchers to be competitive for further independent funding. We aim to provide relevant and
personalized DE interventions for pregnant and postpartum women, to reduce the risk for
impairment and mortalities for both mother and infant."

The Emory-Sage-SGC-Jax TREAT-AD Center Administrative and Data Management Core (Admin Core)
serves four functions: serves four primary functions: (1) to provide overall administrative organization, oversight
and management for all work performed within the Center, (2) oversight of target portfolio, (3) to support the
open distribution of all TREAT-AD generated reagents, tools, probes, data, and knowledge, and (4) to inform
and engage the broader research community in the use of Center outputs. The Admin Core is led by MPIs
Levey (Emory), Greenwood (Sage), Edwards (SGC), and Carter (Jax), who together will establish and
implement administrative and management structures to ensure that the Center is appropriately meeting
milestones and deliverables, is openly sharing assets across the community, and is working across Cores for
effective evaluation and management of target programs as they move through the Center pipeline. In addition,
the Admin Core will manage interactions with the external research community to evaluate a set of targets
across a diverse portfolio of therapeutic hypotheses, to identify domain experts that can serve as partners to
guide decisions around each therapeutic hypothesis that is selected, and to identify researchers that will use
the assets developed by the Center to test these (and other) therapeutic hypotheses.
The specific aims of the Admin Core are:
 1. Provide strategic oversight and administrative support across the Center.

10949455,"Euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1, also known as GLP) is a key histone methylation writer
intricately associated with Kleefstra Syndrome (KS), a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
by intellectual disability, developmental delay, childhood hypotonia, distinctive facial features, and comorbidities,
including autism spectrum disorders. Its modular structure encompasses the ankyrin repeat scaffolding domain
responsible for methyl-lysine recognition (histone reader function) and the SET catalytic domain governing
histone methylation (writer function). Despite the identification of numerous mutations in patients, their precise
effects on EHMT1 function and direct links to pathogenicity remain elusive. As such, most are annotated as
variants of uncertain significance (VUS). To enhance EHMT1 genomic variation interpretation and uncover
novel insights into its structure-function relationship, we have harnessed a comprehensive computational
approach to perform deep variant phenotyping, which integrates mechanisms rooted in sequence, structure,
and dynamics. Through this approach, we have identified domain-specific metrics and reclassified KS variants
within the SET domain. In this proposal, we aim to perform the first in-depth comprehensive deep variant
phenotyping of KS-associated variants within the ankyrin repeat domain and further elucidate the structure-
function relationship of variants within both the SET and ankyrin repeat domains to better understand
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that KS-associated
genomic variants within EHMT1 alter structural dynamics as well as biochemical and biophysical properties
to impact domain-specific functions. The rationale is that comprehensive investigations into the biochemical,
biophysical, and structural dynamics of KS-associated genomic variants within the EHMT1 SET and ankyrin
domains will reveal detailed mechanisms underlying the disruption of domain-specific functions, providing
novel insight into the molecular basis of KS. To test our central hypothesis, we propose two interrelated, yet
independent AIMS: (1) to define the impact of KS-associated genomic variants within the ankyrin domain on
the structural dynamics of EHMT1 using deep variant phenotyping and (2) to elucidate the underlying
biochemical and biophysical mechanisms of EHMT1 dysfunction caused by KS-associated genomic variants.
These findings will establish crucial foundations for subsequent investigations involving cell-based and animal
model studies. Ultimately, our discoveries will have the potential to guide future therapeutic strategies aimed
at ameliorating the impacts of KS-associated variants on EHMT1 function and, by extension, on chromatin
regulation and epigenetic processes. Collectively, these studies will enhance the annotation of genomic
variants and facilitate the development of more precise, personalized approaches to disease management
and treatment, ultimately improving the well-being of affected children and offering support to their families."
10950642,"Project Summary
HCV is a major threat worldwide, infecting over 58 million people and causing 300,000 deaths from HCV-related
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year. Nigeria has approximately 2.2 million people living with
HCV with prevalence rates ranging from 0.1-30% depending on the population and region. HCV contributes to
about a quarter of HCC in Nigeria, which is the fifth leading cause of cancer and cancer related mortality in this
country. Approximately 15-45% of persons infected with HCV will spontaneously clear the virus, therefore after
testing positive on a serological test (anti-HCV), confirmation of HCV viremia with laboratory-based molecular
HCV viral load (VL) testing is necessary to identify those who need treatment. In Nigeria and many other LMICs,
access to laboratory-based VL tests remains limited and as a result many people screening positive for anti-
HCV and with active HCV (defined as positive anti-HCV, detectable (>LLD) HCV RNA) are never linked to care
and treatment. Successful treatment of HCV has significantly reduced the risk of HCV-related HCC. The lack of
a single step point-of-care (POC) test for the diagnosis of active HCV infection both high- and low-and-middle
income countries is a significant impediment to swift initiation of treatment impacting the ability to end the HCV
epidemic and prevent long-term complications such as HCC. Here we propose to develop and validate an HCV
test for the DASH™ platform for the diagnosis of active HCV at the point of care, by sensitively detecting HCV
viral RNA, obviating the requirement for two-step serologic and laboratory based molecular testing. The
DASH™HCV test is designed to be easily operated by non-laboratory personnel in settings that lack laboratory
infrastructure. A capillary blood sample is simply collected by fingerstick, added to the test cartridge, and inserted
into the DASH™ analyzer. After 15 minutes, an easy-to-read qualitative positive or negative result appears on
the unit's touch screen. Following development, the diagnostic accuracy of DASH™ HCV will be evaluated on
both stored plasma and prospectively collected whole blood samples from Nigeria. The acceptability and usability
of DASH™ HCV will also be evaluated in real-world settings among at risk adults from three diverse geographic
regions of Nigeria. This study is expected to lead to the approval of a small, portable, cheap POC molecular
device for the rapid, single step, diagnosis of active HCV in a wide range of LMIC settings that will significantly
increase availability and access to HCV testing and thus reduce the incidence of HCV- related HCC."
10950644,"The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, but the neonatal mouse
heart possesses remarkable regeneration capacity within 7 days after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms
that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. A common
principle observed in tissue regeneration is the reactivation of the previously employed developmental
transcriptional programs. The mechanisms in heart development also govern cardiac regeneration of the injured
heart. Therefore, understanding the transcriptional program regulation during heart development is of critical to
guide cardiac regeneration therapies. Inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocyte has been
developed for disease research and drug development, and these cells are now gradually entering the clinical
research phase for the testing of heart regeneration therapies. However, a major hurdle for their applications is
the immature state of these cardiomyocytes.Cardiac development is orchestrated by multiple layers of
epigenetic regulation in a collaborative and strictly temporal manner. New high-throughput sequencing
approaches have begun to reveal a new layer of epigenetic regulation, mRNA methylation (N6-methyladenosine,
m6A). The m6A is installed by the methyltransferase complex consisting of methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3)
and Mettl14. The recent discovery of the broad role of m6A mRNA methylation in regulating cell fates, embryonic
and brain development, and stress response in adult brain highlights the importance of another layer of
epigenetic regulation at the RNA level. Conditional Mettl14 knockout in nerves system resulted in abnormal brain
development and early death after birth. Delayed differentiation/maturation due to prolonged cell cycle or
impaired neuron proliferation are two possible underlying mechanisms. The role of m6a mRNA methylation in
cardiac development is still largely unknown. Cardiac-specific Mettl3 knockout mice showed no evident heart
development deficiency. However, we discovered that cardiac-specific Mettl14 KO mice (cMettl14 KO) displayed
severe cardiomyopathy resulting death within two months after birth. The mechanisms of the cardiomyopathy in
cMettl14 KO mice are unclear. We performed m6A sequencing on the hearts from WT and cMettl14 KO mice at
the age of 5 days. We found that many of the decreased m6A tagged transcripts in cMettl14 KO mice were
related to cardiomyocyte differentiation, proliferation, maturation or hypertrophy. Among them, the m6A level and
mRNA level of Bone Morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), BMP10 and Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family,
Member 5A (WNT5a) were significantly decreased in cMettle14 KO mice. Importantly, we found that the
proliferation of cardiomyocyte was increased in cMettl14 KO mice, while the maturation of the cardiomyocyte,
assessed by calcium transient, mitochondrial function and the level of fetal/adult myofilament isoforms, was
impaired in cMettl14 KO mice. In this proposal, we will test the hypotheses that Mettl14 mediated m6A mRNA
methylation orchestrates postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation through BMP 2/10 and/or WNT5a signaling."

Approximately 65% of the United States population reports at least one adverse childhood event. A third of
adversity-exposed youth do not meet age expectations for language, which is triple the rate of developmental
language disorders in the general population. A critical area of interest for interventions is the role of parent-
mediated language input, characterized by the quantity and quality of parent talk directed toward the child.
Researchers often focus on socioeconomic status (e.g., parental education) as the primary environmental
influence on parent-mediated language input. In contrast, this interdisciplinary study posits the novel construct
of adversity exposure, emphasizing the role of intergenerational pathways. Specifically, the parent’s own history
of childhood adversity is included in the model as a predictor of parent-mediated language input while also
applying a genetically-informed design. This study will leverage an existing dataset of 325 preschoolers who
have histories of extensive adversity exposure and were followed longitudinally for two years. Using video-
recordings of a semi-structured free play task, parent-child interactions will be transcribed and coded for
language sample analysis. The aims of this project are to a) determine the impact of adversity exposure on
parent-child linguistic interactions, and b) examine intergenerational effects on parent-mediated language input
and child language outcomes. By elucidating the pathways linking adversity exposure and language acquisition,
this study will determine an additional environmental factor beyond socioeconomic status that may serve as a
risk factor for delayed or impaired language. Further, this study will inform the foundational knowledge used to
devise increasingly effective and efficient language intervention frameworks and strategies."
10950665,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Direct recording of neural activity from the human brain using implanted electrodes (intracranial EEG,
iEEG) is a fast-growing and high-impact technique in human neuroscience. The NIH has mandated data
sharing plans, but useful sharing that promotes neuroscience discoveries from archival datasets faces many
obstacles. One obstacle is difficulties in creating shareable iEEG datasets. In Aim 1, we will create new tools
based on the iEEG-BIDS standard, created in 2019 to promote sharing by providing specifications for iEEG
datasets. Aim 1A will create an iEEG-BIDS compliant solution for anatomical iEEG data, localizing electrodes
using the pre-operative MRI and post-operative CT scans. Aim 1B will create an iEEG-BIDS compliant solution
for functional iEEG data, the voltage by time data collected from each electrode as a measure of neural activity.
Aim 2 will address the problem that it is currently very difficult for iEEG investigators to share the results of
their iEEG analyses, and difficult for other scientists to explore them. A new tool will merge an advanced 3D
Viewer designed for iEEG with the output of an investigator's existing anatomical and functional iEEG
pipelines. The tool will export a single, compact package that can be shared directly with other scientists or
uploaded to journals or an archive. By simply opening the package in a web browser, users will be able to
interactively explore the dataset, facilitating replication, reliability, and new discoveries."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Bioinformatics Core (Bioinf Core) is to integrate multiple data streams to prioritize and
validate protein targets for novel Alzheimer’s disease (AD) therapeutics. We will merge genome-wide
association, medical and molecular genetics, and model systems data to create a comprehensive genetics
score. These scores will integrate study results from diverse ancestries to encompass a broader view of AD
genetics. A complementary multi-omics score will be derived from merging transcriptomic and proteomic data
from postmortem AD brain studies, including recently generated samples from diverse cohorts. These scores
will be combined to yield a data-driven AD Risk Score for every gene and protein. Groups of high-scoring
proteins with common functions will be identified through defined AD Biodomains that annotate AD-relevant
biological processes. Groups of proteins in a common AD Biodomain will be analyzed via network methods to
generate a series of distinct therapeutic hypotheses, each comprised of 10-20 resident proteins in an identified
biological process. In collaboration with the Assay Core, we will test candidate proteins by genetic perturbation
in human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines differentiated into relevant cell types by functional and
multi-omic assays. Successful candidate proteins will alter hypothesis-specific cell functions and coordinatively
modify transcript/protein levels across the hypothesis to mimic postmortem AD brain data. All bioinformatic and
experimental data will be disseminated as a Tier 1 Target Enabling Package, with successful proteins
promoted to Tier 2 development.
The specific aims of the Bioinf Core are:
 1. Prioritize target proteins and therapeutic hypotheses with updated study data and advanced
 computational approaches.
 2. Iteratively assess hypothesis validity with cell models.
 3. Create open resources to disseminate hypotheses and contextualize AD molecular risk."
10949011,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Aspergillus species are ubiquitous molds that cause clinical disease in hosts with impaired immunity or
abnormal mucosal defenses. In particular, individuals with neutropenia or neutrophil defects are particularly
susceptible to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), a life-threatening respiratory infection with limited
treatment options. Neutrophils play a key role in host defenses against this pathogen but little is known about
the contribution of these cells beyond their direct microbicidal role. This project examines how neutrophils
influence the development of adaptive immunity to Aspergillus in order to better understand mechanisms of host
immunity to Aspergillus during neutropenia. In the preliminary data for this proposal, we report that neutrophil-
depleted mice have an exaggerated IL-17A response compared to neutrophil-sufficient mice after Aspergillus.
We show that following challenge with Aspergillus, IL-17A-producing CD4+ tissue resident memory (TRM) cells
persist in the lung up to three weeks after challenge in neutrophil-depleted mice, and that mice that were
neutrophil-depleted during a primary Aspergillus challenge are protected from a secondary challenge with
Aspergillus when compared to mice that were neutrophil-sufficient during primary challenge. We therefore seek
to test the central hypothesis that, in the absence of neutrophils, Aspergillus induces an exuberant IL-17
response which leads to the persistence of IL-17A-producing CD4+ tissue resident memory cells, and that these
cells confer protection against subsequent infection with Aspergillus. To test this hypothesis, we plan to pursue
the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine if CD4+ tissue resident memory lymphocytes protect against
Aspergillus infection during neutropenia and Aim 2: Identify pathways involved in neutrophil-independent IL-
17A-mediated protection during rechallenge with Aspergillus. The project brings an innovative approach to the
study of this infection through the use of a dual challenge model of IPA which mimics repeated exposure to this
fungal pathogen in human hosts and the characterization of a novel and previously undescribed protective role
for TRM in the setting of neutrophil-depletion. The proposed studies are relevant to public health by defining a
new mechanism of host defense against an important human pathogen that should allow for future development
of novel therapeutics or preventative strategies."
10950209,"Project Summary
 Optical recording of calcium transients from large number of neurons is an indispensable technique for
comprehending neuronal ensembles during brain processes. While two-photon, confocal, and light sheet
microscopes have effectively recorded from many neurons, these devices come at a high cost. This project
aims to create an affordable device for imaging calcium transients, using pinhole illumination to create optical
sectioning, which will reduce background light (F0) and consequently increasing the optical signal (dF/F0). The
device will be simple enough to share as an open-source tool or as a modification of existing brightfield
fluorescent microscopes. The project's significance lies in its capacity to identify a substantially greater number
of neurons compared to widefield fluorescent imaging. Additionally, the open-source and low-cost approach is
likely to attract a broader user base. Our proposed designs are supported by preliminary experiments and offer
several advantages: 1. Elimination of mechanical scanning components, granting significant cost reduction
compared to spinning disk confocal microscopes. 2. Using ordinary CMOS cameras, eliminating the need for
expensive scientific-grade CMOS and EMCCD cameras. 3. High light flux, enabling the use of LED light
sources, reducing the expense associated with high-power laser light sources. The proposed device will be
constructed by modifying an existing brightfield fluorescent microscope, enabling us to test the designs with a
modest grant, without requiring additional capital equipment. If successful, we anticipate the ability to
simultaneously record from hundreds of neurons at a cost less than one-tenth of a two-photon microscope.
In SA1, we introduce the patterned pinhole illuminator which can decrease background light and enhance
optical signals of neuronal calcium transients in densely labeled brain tissue with GCaMP6f. Planar pinhole
patterns on a glass disk and pinholes created by microlens arrays will be tested.
In SA2, we propose a fiber optics-based pinhole illuminator, a coherent fiber optics bundle installed at the
plane of the field diaphragm. Each fiber within the bundle will function as an illuminating pinhole when one end
of the fiber is connected to a 470 nm LED chip. These LEDs can be electronically switched on and off to create
a scanning pinhole pattern across the imaging field without the need for moving parts. This fiber optics-based
pinhole illuminator would have a potential to simultaneous recording of up to four times more neurons
compared to the designs in SA1. since it fully illuminates the entire imaging field."

The Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) is the dedicated MD Anderson site for complex
biologically-based new drug evaluation. With its 32-room nursing treatment center and adjacent full-function
research laboratory, the CTRC is an ideal location to perform intensive clinical trials with a focus on first-in-
human, phase I, and phase II studies requiring rigorous time points and pharmacologic testing. The CTRC
provides a distinct resource for physician-scientists and clinical investigators to develop new agents for cancer
treatment by offering coordination of multidisciplinary research, regulatory compliance, budget development,
intensive and time-sensitive monitoring of patients, phlebotomy, and prompt and accurate specimen processing,
storage, tracking, and shipment. The CTRC director, Filip Janku, MD, PhD; co-director, Daniel Karp, MD;
clinical administrative director, Brenda Brown, MSN, RN, OCN, NEA-BC; and assistant director, Passion Lockett,
DrPH, CCRC, provide leadership through planning, directing, and coordinating the integration of services and
transfer of knowledge between the CTRC and the other CCSG cores. Current services include biospecimen
collection and processing ranging from basic pharmacokinetic sampling to cell isolation and enumeration. Major
equipment includes 15 centrifuges, a biosafety cabinet, 6 ultra-low freezers, a cell culture analyzer, and an
AeroScout freezer monitoring system. Demand for services has increased by 98% since the previous grant cycle,
and the CTRC has met this demand by increasing efficiency and increasing capacity by expanding from 18 beds

10953750,"PROJECT SUMMARY: FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS CORE (FGC) 
Functional genomics employs multiple technologies and genetic tools to study the complicated interactions 
between genotype and phenotype on a genome-wide scale. Genome-scale gain- and loss-of-function genetic 
screens are powerful tools for conducting such studies. The mission of the Functional Genomics Core (FGC; 
previously the CCSG Developing core shRNA and ORFeome Core) is to provide researchers at MD Anderson 
Cancer Center with cutting-edge technologies to study gene functions in cell-based assays. The FGC utilizes 
open reading frame (ORF), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and guided RNA (gRNA) libraries to conduct genome- 
wide screens to identify oncogenes, tumor suppressors, metastasis regulators, drug resistance–conferring 
genes, and new therapeutic targets. Dr. Mien-Chie Hung, vice president for basic research and the chair of the 
Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, is the director of the FGC, and Dr. Dihua Yu is the co-director. 
During the current grant cycle MD Anderson provided $285,151 to purchase capital equipment and prior to 2012, 
provided funds to purchase FGC's libraries, including the pGIPZ shRNA library (human and mouse), human 
ORFeome Collaboration library, and Precision LentiORF library from GE Dharmacon and a human genome- 
wide pooled shRNA library from Cellecta. The FGC also has access to the Toronto KnockOut v3 human pooled 
gRNA library from Dr. Moffat's laboratory at the University of Toronto. Currently, the FGC provides 1) individual 
shRNA or ORF clones; 2) retro- and lenti-virus packaging; 3) custom shRNA or ORF libraries; 4) gene-knockout 
cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; and 5) project services to help researchers optimize screening assays, 
perform screens, and analyze data. The requested FGC grant Yr44 budget is $150,977/year; CCSG support 
would provide 33% of the budget. Since its inception, the FGC has provided services to 176 cancer center 
members in 64 departments at MD Anderson, representing all 16 CCSG programs. A total of 162 principal 
investigators have peer-reviewed support. During Yr42, all 80 users representing the 16 CCSG programs had 
received peer-reviewed funding. Most usage was by the Cancer Biology and Metastasis, Brain Cancer, and 
Breast Cancer CCSG programs, each of which was responsible for 12% of the total usage. During the grant 
period, the FGC facilitated 156 peer-reviewed publications, including 128 (82%) in journals with IF >5 and 59 
(38%) in journals with IF >10, such as Nature, Cell, and Lancet Oncol. The FGC specific aims are: Aim 1: To 
provide functional genomics services to cancer center members; Aim 2: To perform genetic screens for 
basic/translational research and drug discovery; Aim 3: To implement new functional genomic technologies and 
augment existing services; Aim 4: To offer training and consultation to FGC users."

The Cancer Biology and Metastasis Program (CBMP) consists of 47 members (42 primary, 1 associate, 4 
adjunct) from 20 departments. The program is led by Drs. Mien-Chie Hung, an international leader in cancer 
cell signaling, Menashe Bar-Eli, an expert in the biology of the tumor microenvironment, and Dihua Yu, whose 
laboratory studies mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. The 
program uses molecular and cellular biological approaches to understand the biology underlying the three 
themes of cancer cell signaling, tumor microenvironment, and metastasis, with the common goal of identifying 
therapeutic targets. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: To improve our understanding of cancer cell 
signaling in tumor development, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Program members explore signaling 
pathways of growth factor receptors; inflammation and metabolism in cancer cells; and roles of epigenetic 
events such as post-translational modifications (PTM) and histone modifications, miRNAs, and ncRNAs in 
cancer growth. Aim 2: To delineate critical factors in the tumor microenvironment that drive tumor progression. 
Program members focus on how microenvironment-derived signals promote metastatic progression and 
facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT)/cancer stem cells, angiogenesis and fibrosis. Aim 3: To 
investigate underlying mechanisms of metastasis and develop novel therapies to prevent or treat metastasis. 
Program members use animal models to study metastasis, examine the genetics and genomics of metastasis, 
and identify new oncogenic drivers that could serve as potential targets to prevent or treat metastatic disease. 
The annual direct peer-reviewed funding totals $9.6M with $5.3M (55%) from NCI grants. Since the last 
submission, the program has published 810 papers: 199 (25%) represent intra-programmatic collaborations, 
436 (54%) represent inter-programmatic collaborations, and 602 (74%) represent inter-institutional 
collaborations. Sixty-nine percent of publications have appeared in journals with IF >5 and 29% in journals with 
IF >10, including Nature, Cell, Nat Med, Cancer Cell, Cancer Discov, Nat and Cell Biol. Program members 
utilize all 14 Shared Resources. During the last funding period, the program has a) identified a novel receptor 
tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathway regulating miRNA maturation (Shen J et al, Nature, 2013); b) 
demonstrated that EMT is dispensable for metastasis but induces chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer 
(Zheng X et al, Nature, 2015); c) provided a direct link of epigenetics to cancer metabolism (Wang Y et al, 
Nature, 2017); d) identified co-evolution between metastatic cancer cells and their microenvironment (Zhang L 
et al, Nature, 2015); e) demonstrated the oncogenic role of long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer metastasis 
(Xing Z et al, Cell, 2014); f) discovered a novel PTEN pathway and provided a means to track targetable 
vulnerabilities in cancers (Zhao D et al, Nature, 2017); and g) engineered exosomes to facilitate therapeutic 
targeting of oncogenic Kras (Kamerkar S et al, Nature, 2017)."
10895361,"Project Summary 
For nearly two decades, the “atopic march” concept, which describes the sequential development of atopic 
dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), asthma, and allergic rhinitis (AR) has served as a guiding principle, however, 
a recent NIH workshop concluded that only about 3% of children follow the traditional atopic march. They stated 
that while early-life AD remains a major risk factor for the development of any atopic disease, there is no single 
unique pathway for the atopic march. Rather, there is significant heterogeneity including the timing and organ(s) 
affected, and the march needs to be revised to include this heterogeneity and incorporate the various 
combinations. We designed the Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) to Asthma in CHildren 
(MPAACH) cohort, the first US prospective longitudinal early life cohort of AD, to meet this need. MPAACH 
includes 65% Black children and is one of the only early life cohorts that represents this historically 
underrepresented and understudied population. Previous studies of the atopic march were done mostly in White 
populations. Our early findings from MPAACH reveal marked racial differences in the atopic march concept and 
underscore the racial bias in current paradigms around the atopic march. Black children are disproportionately 
impacted by asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality and this race-asthma association is not eliminated after 
adjusting for socioeconomic factors suggesting that race may also serve as a proxy for a critical biologic factor 
that we do not currently recognize. Our central hypothesis is that the longitudinal trajectories of sensitization and 
allergic disease progression are different between Whites and Blacks, and that this is mechanistically due, in 
part, to biologic differences. We will conduct skin transcriptomics and integrate this data with longitudinal 
immunologic, environmental, and clinical data to construct the pathogenesis of allergic disease development, 
progression, persistence, remission, and resolution. Race is a complex concept including sociocultural and 
socioeconomic, as well as biologic factors. As such, we will define Black and White using self-reported race, 
genetic ancestry, and biologic methods that quantify melanin content in the skin, thus recognizing the continuum 
resulting from biologic diversity in addition to the sociocultural definitions of race. This application will have 
significant public health impact. Through the proposed aims, we will (1) define longitudinal AD phenotypes in 
Black and White MPAACH children, (2) elucidate skin transcriptomic profiles and biologic pathways that predict 
AD longitudinal phenotypes for Black and White MPAACH children and (3) define longitudinal 
immunophenotypes of AD in Black and White children and construct the pathogenesis of allergic disease by race 
based on genetics (from Project 2)? skin transcriptomics ? immunologic milieu ? longitudinal clinical 
endotypes."
10895362,"Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects up to 20% of children worldwide and is an increasing public health problem. 
Although AD in infants and young children can resolve, there is a substantial risk of progression from AD to other 
atopic diseases, including food allergy (FA), allergic rhinitis, and asthma, i.e. the atopic march. The mechanisms 
underlying the atopic march are incompletely understood and this is a critical gap in knowledge as this
information is necessary in order to design preventive strategies that can hijack or abort the atopic march. The 
crucial role of Filament aggregating protein (or filaggrin, FLG) in the development of AD and the atopic march 
has been demonstrated and extensively reviewed. The Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to 
Asthma in CHildren (MPAACH) cohort is an early life cohort of children with AD with extensive longitudinal clinical 
health outcomes data and longitudinal biospecimens. Using MPAACH, we recently found that low non-lesional, 
but not lesional, skin FLG expression is associated with the development of co-sensitization and moderate-severe AD, both key risk factors for the future development of allergic co-morbidities of AD. Project 2 will test 
the central hypothesis that genetic factors including CARD14 act in concert with environmental factors and 
inflammation to determine FLG expression in AD skin, driving transient or persistent skin barrier dysfunction, 
which may differentially impact long-term AD outcomes. Project 2 builds upon prior cycles of AADCRC funding 
and leverages the extensive longitudinal clinical and molecular data and biospecimens available from MPAACH 
and Project 1. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variants that modulate skin FLG expression and integrate this 
with clinical, exposure, and molecular data from MPAACH to identify the combination of factors that determine 
skin FLG expression. We found that rs11652075 in CARD14 results in increased expression of CARD14 and 
leads to attenuated FLG expression. In Aim 2, we will build on this data and determine the mechanisms that link 
rs11652075 and enhanced CARD14 signaling to FLG homeostasis. While LoF FLG mutations are important in 
the atopic march, the relationship between the trajectory of FLG expression in early life and over time with 
longitudinal AD outcomes is unclear. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of low skin FLG expression 
(persistent or transient) over time and the genetic loci identified in Aim 1 on AD outcomes. Based on reports that 
early application of emollients to the skin may prevent the development of AD, allergic sensitization, and food 
allergy, this study is clinically important because it may help identify individuals with the magnitude and duration 
of dysregulated barrier function that may benefit from prevention and intervention strategies designed to enhance 
skin barrier function. Moreover, our study will help determine the optimal timing to deliver these interventions. 
Finally, this project adequately represents Black and White children and will synergize with Projects 1 and 3. 
This timely project will have significant public health impact."
10895363,"Summary
The long-term goal of this study is to elucidate the immunologic features of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). This 
is an important subject as EoE is an emerging, chronic disease that often starts in childhood and continues into 
adulthood and is associated with substantial morbidity, especially the other atopic diseases being studied in this 
U19 proposal, yet has no FDA-approved therapies. Understanding this subject has significant implications as 
elucidating its fundamental immunologic features has potential to lay the foundation for improved diagnostics 
and therapies. Our central hypothesis is that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) serves as an esophageal 
sensor and mediates its action via the transcription factor OVOL1, which induces transcription of the antiprotease 
SPINK7, and that IL-4 and IL-13 repress this pathway. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on findings from
our current U19 grant that have provided evidence for a central role of serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 7 
(SPINK7) in EoE pathogenesis. Acquired loss of SPINK7 is sufficient to unleash uncontrolled esophageal 
protease activity, which in turn induces loss of epithelial cell differentiation, loss of desmosomal protein 
expression, and impaired barrier function, as well as overproduction of proinflammatory mediators, including 
TSLP. Yet, there is virtually nothing known about the molecular regulation of SPINK7 expression, which is the 
subject of this grant renewal. We have uncovered that the esophageal epithelial enriched transcription factor, 
Ovo-like transcriptional repressor 1 (OVOL1) regulates SPINK7 promoter activity and expression. Furthermore, 
OVOL1 overexpression increases SPINK7 expression, whereas OVOL1 depletion decreases SPINK7, impairs 
the epithelial barrier, and importantly increases TSLP production. Mechanistically, ligands of the AHR induce 
OVOL1 nuclear translocation, which in turn promotes SPINK7 expression; conversely, AHR antagonists inhibit 
SPINK7 expression. A link with type 2 immunity is revealed by the finding that IL-4 and IL-13 reduce AHRinduced OVOL1 nuclear translocation and OVOL1-induced SPINK7 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of 
CAPN14, which is encoded for by a chief EoE genetic susceptibility locus, decreases OVOL1 expression. 
Translational studies demonstrate a decrease in esophageal expression of OVOL1 protein in patients with EoE 
and blockade of serine protease activity attenuates murine experimental EoE. The clinical significance of these 
data are underscored by the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, which is used to treat EoE, being an AHR ligand 
that induces SPINK7. We will test the central hypothesis via 3 complementary aims using innovative approaches
that combine molecular, genomic, and biological studies. In Aim 1, we will test the role of OVOL1 in esophageal 
epithelium by regulating the expression of differentiation genes, including SPINK7, testing the hypothesis that 
OVOL1 is critical for epithelial differentiation and barrier function. In Aim 2, we will examine AHR regulation of 
SPINK7, testing the hypothesis that AHR is an esophageal sensor and that its mechanism depends upon OVOL1
and SPINK7. In Aim 3, we will test whether IL-4 and IL-13 oppose SPINK7 and whether this occurs via CAPN14."
10895360,"Allergic diseases (asthma, allergic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis, food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis 
(EoE)) commonly affect US children and have substantial lifetime co-morbidity. Our findings over the last 3 
funding cycles identify and implicate novel epithelial pathways as key drivers of allergic inflammation and 
allergic disease pathogenesis. However, how these key drivers and other epithelial pathways contribute to 
development, persistence, progression and remission of allergic disease remains largely unknown. Our Center 
is focused on refining current atopic march paradigms and elucidating the epithelial-centric mechanisms that 
drive the atopic march. This proposal’s overarching hypothesis is that homeostatic mechanisms at epithelial 
surfaces, upon dysregulation, promote allergic inflammation and contribute to the persistence, progression, 
remission, and resolution of allergic disease(s). This hypothesis will be tested by three integrated and 
synergistic projects that combine epidemiologic, basic, translational, and clinical research approaches. The 
Data Integration and Analysis Core’s (DIAC) purpose is to provide the quantitative expertise to accomplish the 
overall objectives, curate and integrate data, and perform synergistic analyses. The DIAC’s expertise in 
quantitative genetics, genomics, statistics, ancestry, and bioinformatics enhances the capacity for rigorous and 
reproducible research that will be applied to advance the goals of the overall Center as well as assist the 
project investigators with their specific hypotheses and aims. This DIAC’s aims are to 1) curate, integrate, and 
share data and results across the U19 Center team and with the scientific community; 2) provide analytic rigor 
and expertise to the Center Projects so that the Center can achieve its overarching goal and the Projects can 
achieve their goals; and 3) perform synergistic analyses across all Projects so the Center can achieve its full 
potential. Our longstanding success in evaluating the role of the epithelium in allergic disorders coupled with 
our MPAACH longitudinal cohort, novel experimental systems to perform mechanistic studies, and analytic 
expertise, uniquely position us to accomplish the Center objectives. Successful completion of the proposed 
studies will provide novel insights into a key question in the allergy field: Why is allergic inflammation restricted 
to one tissue in some cases, while it progresses to involve additional tissues in other individuals?"

10950685,"Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms, cardiovascular disease (CVD)
remains a primary cause of death across the world. Traditional risk factors for CVD are primarily
metabolic in origin, including obesity, sedentary lifestyle and insulin resistance. Cardiometabolic
diseases are associated with inflammation and chronic exercise training has been shown to
decrease inflammation. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is the age-
related expansion of somatic clones in hematopoietic stem cells secondary to mutations
associated with the development of hematologic malignancy and represents a state of
heightened inflammation. CHIP is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and incident
cardiovascular outcomes, however the relationship between CHIP and CRF has not been
evaluated. We have identified metabolic biomarkers that are associated with CRF and incident
cardiovascular events; as well as CHIP, suggesting a potential link between CHIP-induced
inflammation and impaired metabolic function leading to CVD. It is unknown whether CHIP is
associated with worse baseline CRF and whether it may predict response to chronic exercise
training, providing an opportunity to improve personalized care for CVD prevention. The overall
objectives of this application is to determine the role of CHIP, an emerging inflammatory aging
biomarker, in CRF and cardiometabolic responses to chronic exercise interventions and identify
metabolic dysregulation underlying this relationship. Our specific aims are (1) Determine if CHIP
is associated with worse baseline CRF and predicts heterogeneity in response to chronic
exercise training in patients with cardiometabolic disease and (2) Evaluate potential metabolic
mechanisms underlying CHIP, CRF and response to chronic exercise training. To achieve these
aims we will leverage two randomized clinical trials of patients with metabolic syndrome and
perform targeted sequencing of CHIP driver genes. For Aim 1, we will test associations of CHIP
with baseline peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) and change in pVO2. For Aim 2, we will use
inflammatory marker, plasma and skeletal muscle metabolite data to determine whether
metabolic dysregulation mediates the relationship between CHIP and CRF. The research
proposed here will allow me to build on the following skills: 1) analysis of somatic genetic
variant; 2) computational and statistical skills in multi-omic datasets; and 3) metabolomic
analyses including systems biology approaches to analyses. The data gathered during this

A drawback of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for breast cancer risk and related phenotypes is their
limited insights into genotype-to-phenotype mechanisms for identified genomic regions. Although integrating
GWAS with functional genomics datasets, like the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and The Cancer
Genomic Atlas (TCGA), has yielded promising results in identifying candidate target genes for many traits1–3,
these approaches overlook the complexity of alternative splicing and isoform diversity within the transcriptome.
Indeed, recent studies of long read RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data across tissues reveal that as much as 40-
60% of the human transcriptome is unannotated6–8 due to overlooked isoforms. We propose to re-align existing
breast-specific short-read RNA-seq datasets using novel isoform annotations developed from long-read RNA-
seq data. We will then integrate these with existing breast cancer and mammographic density GWAS data to
identify isoform- and splice-site-specific mechanisms underlying genetic associations for breast cancer and
mammographic density phenotypes. We will build on our recent work where we developed and showcased the
promise of isoform-level transcriptome-wide association studies (isoTWAS), an innovative machine learning
framework that integrates genetics, all expressed isoforms of a gene, and phenotypic associations. Specifically,
we will first quantify isoform expression and alternative splicing events in GTEx and TCGA using novel transcript
assemblies from long-read RNA-seq datasets (Aim 1). We will benchmark multiple statistical approaches for
alignment of isoforms by conducting extensive evaluation studies. We will then leverage these newly aligned
isoforms and alternative splicing events in breast tissue to pinpoint isoforms and alternative splicing events likely
to mediate germline genetic associations with breast cancer risk and mammographic density phenotypes (Aim
2). This innovative proposal aligns with the NCI strategic objective of Understanding the Mechanisms of
Cancer and Detecting and Diagnosing Cancer and addresses a critical challenge in studying the genetic
etiology of breast cancer: prioritizing potential causal biological mechanisms for further follow-up.
 Our proposal is unique in that it will re-quantify and integrate multi-tissue, multi-level transcriptomic reference
panels (both short- and long-read RNA-seq) with robust GWAS summary statistics using cutting-edge
computational tools for transcriptomics and a novel integrative framework. By combining publicly available multi-
level `omic datasets in a systemic genomic epidemiology framework, our work will provide both molecular data
resources and reproducible computational frameworks that can be easily expanded to other tissues and traits.
Specifically, we will develop open-source computational pipelines for developing tissue-specific, novel isoform
annotations for short-read RNA-seq alignment and expression quantification and create and maintain a publicly
available portal to host iso- and splice-QTL summary statistics and predictive models allowing for the broader
research community to explore similar investigations across traits and tissues."
10950848,"Spiny projection neurons (SPNs) carry much of the weight of the basal ganglia (BG) information
processing. One cell type (dSPNs) contributes to the Direct BG, while the other cell type (iSPNs)
projects to the Indirect BG pathway. The imbalance across these two neural pathways is associated
with either hypokinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), or hyperkinetic disorders such as
Huntington's and tics. We will test two hypotheses. >>Hypothesis-1 is grounded in intracellular
recordings obtained from the cell bodies of dSPNs and iSPNs, revealing consistent physiological
disparities between the two cell types. Our hypothesis posits that these observed physiological
distinctions in cell bodies stem from underlying differences in dendritic properties. To validate this
hypothesis, we plan to conduct recordings of dendritic electrical signals, including synaptic and AP
waveforms, and dendritic regenerative potentials (dendritic spikes), within primary, secondary, and
tertiary branches of individual neurons belonging to either the dSPN or iSPN subtype. >>Hypothesis-2
is rooted in the findings of several translational studies demonstrating the protective effects of specific
drugs, namely K+ channel blockers, on dopaminergic (DA) neurons in animal models of PD. Our
hypothesis posits that the systemic administration of these drugs not only shields DA neurons but also
impacts the dendrites and axons of striatal SPNs, which project directly or indirectly to DA cells. We
propose that the experimental use of K+ channel blockers in PD therapies significantly alters the
electrical signaling within striatal dendrites. To explore this, we pose crucial questions: Do these drugs
facilitate or impede the generation of local dendritic NMDA spikes and complex spikes (involving both
dendritic and axonal spikes)? Does their pharmacological impact vary between different subtypes of
SPNs? If so, it implies that drugs safeguarding DA neurons in PD models also influence the balance
between the Direct and Indirect BG pathways. The adjustment of the balance between the “GO” and
“NOGO” pathways is a primary objective in experimental therapies for BG disorders. Our research aims
to elucidate whether these protective K+ channel blockers could be employed to modulate the Direct
and Indirect pathways. If substantiated, this discovery could potentially establish them as
supplementary therapies, complementing approved treatments such as levodopa. Our study not only
promises a physiological understanding of the functioning of these protective treatments, but also
explores the potential of channel modulators in balancing the D/I pathways. Additionally, our proposal
marks the pioneering effort in capturing dendritic electrical signaling in striatum through voltage imaging,
bridging significant gaps in our comprehension of electrical signal processing within the principal
projection neurons of the two BG pathways."
10950640,"Project Summary:
The strategy of selective killing cancer cells while sparing healthy cells holds great promise for cancer therapy,
but its effective implementation remains a formidable challenge for numerous cancer types. Targeted therapies
have so far primarily focused on inhibiting or modulating the activity of proteins that help cancer cells survive or
proliferate, rather than directly targeting the mutations in driver genes. This proposal seeks to bridge this critical
void by introducing and evaluating a novel approach. Its primary goal is to assess a method harnessing
engineered catalytic RNA molecules, known as ribozymes, for the specific killing of cells expressing mRNA of
cancer genes with certain cancer driver mutations. In addition, it will test our recently developed combinatorial
method (RABADOCS) for optimizing ribozyme sequences by sampling millions of variants to identify the most
specific and sufficiently efficient ones.
 We will use group I intron ribozymes from the species Tetrahymena thermophila that can be re-engineered to
specifically recognize a splice site on a targeted mRNA and replace the 3'-portion of that RNA with a sequence
provided by the ribozyme. These ribozymes require a U (uridine) at the target’s splice site and are inactive when
this U is absent. This will allow the ribozymes to differentiate between mutant and wild type target mRNA and
ultimately between cancer and healthy cells. Our ribozymes will mediate cell killing by replacing the 3'-portion of
the target mRNA with a sequence encoding a cytotoxic peptide in-frame. Translation of spliced mRNAs will then
induce death for cells expressing the mutant mRNA.
 As a proof of concept, we will develop and optimize trans-splicing ribozymes that kill cells containing the JAK2
mutation V617F (c.1849G>T), which is the most common driver mutation in classical myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPNs). Aim 1 will optimize the ribozyme’s trans-splicing efficiency and specificity independent of
any toxin sequence. The ribozyme’s external guide sequence will be optimized by employing ribozyme libraries
and selecting the best variants using RABADOCS. In parallel, aim 2 will test several toxin peptides that are
translated from constructs with the same sequence as ribozyme splice products. The results will identify
ribozyme-mediated toxicities that maximize the desired killing while minimizing off-target killing. Lastly, in Aim 3
the most promising ribozymes and toxin sequences will be tested in murine hematopoietic stem-cell like cells
(HPC-7) expressing wild-type JAK2 and/or JAK2V617F.
 We hypothesize that our combinatorial approach will yield ribozymes with high target sensitivity and specificity,
providing the proof of concept that ribozyme-mediated targeted killing of cancer cells can be achieved. As a by-
product, our study may provide the groundwork for a novel therapeutic strategy for JAK2V617F-driven MPNs."
10950641,"ABSTRACT
 Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a unique peroxidase, predominantly expressed in neutrophils and stored in their
azurophilic granules, and accounts for ~5% of the total cell protein. Among all the discovered peroxidases,
MPO is the only one that catalyzes two-electron oxidation of chloride anion to produce hypochlorous acid
(HOCl) in the presence of H2O2 derived from the NADPH oxidase. Clinical validation of the importance of the
oxidant-dependent system for optimal host defense rests in part on the severe and often fatal infections seen
in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited disorder with non-functional phagocyte
NADPH oxidase. Intriguingly, individuals with inherited MPO deficiency develop a narrow set of infections,
largely by fungi. The molecular basis for such a phenotype of MPO deficiency is not clearly known, but likely
reflects actions by uncharacterized antimicrobial activities that may lie in reserve but are recruited under
severe stress. Clinical data further suggest that MPO contributes to tissue damage and inflammation, and is
involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular diseases, kidney
diseases, pulmonary inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, skin inflammation, and neuronal diseases. In spite of
the long-observed clinical association between MPO and inflammation, the exact role of MPO in the onset and
progression of inflammatory diseases remains largely elusive. One of the major obstacles impeding progress in
understanding the contribution of MPO to host defense and to inflammation biology is the lack of a faithful
animal model. Widely used in the field, MPO-knockout (MPO-KO) mice fail in many settings to recapitulate
MPO-associated human diseases, as data obtained often contradict those seen in humans. To meet the urgent
need for an accurate faithful animal model, we have produced an MPO-KO rabbit model using CRIPSR/Cas9
gene editing technology. Due to many similarities between the rabbit and human immune systems, we expect
this novel model to be of great value in studying clinical MPO deficiency. Our overarching hypothesis is that
rabbit MPO deficiency replicates human MPO deficiency in both infection and inflammation diseases, providing
a valuable tool for novel basic discovery and therapeutic development. There are two specific aims in this R21
proposal: 1) to determine if rabbit MPO deficiency reproduces human MPO deficiency in infection; 2) to
discover if rabbit MPO deficiency recapitulates human MPO deficiency in inflammation. Completion of this
research will establish a larger animal model for human MPO deficiency for basic research and therapeutic
development, which is expected to greatly advance our understanding of the biology of MPO and the MPO-
related diseases, and to facilitate the search for effective interventions for these conditions."
10950683,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pain during and after radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) is a major clinical challenge due
to its multifactorial etiology and variable management. In a recent clinical retrospective study of 351 HNC
patients, the majority (61%) undergoing RT reported ongoing “burning” pain by the end of treatment suggesting
a neuropathic pain phenotype. However, radiation-induced pain typically co-develops with oral mucositis (OM),
an inflammatory condition defined as tissue damage to the oral mucosa resulting in highly symptomatic lesions
that affect patients' function, quality of life, and ability to tolerate treatment. Effective pain treatment in HNC
patients receiving RT remains an important unmet clinical need; intermittent breaks taken due to pain often
result in poor therapeutic response and recurrence. Preclinical research efforts are needed to develop and
evaluate new therapeutic options; however, standardized preclinical RT-induced pain models are severely
lacking. Sensory innervation of the oral cavity is dense and TRPV1-expressing peptidergic afferents have been
strongly implicated in pain associated with both oral cancer and RT-induced OM. A recent study by Meneses et
al. found that systemic TRPV1 denervation reduced the severity of radiation-induced OM in a non-tumor
bearing mouse, however pain was not assessed. Furthermore, the impetus for this application is our
preliminary finding of a significant increase in S100-immunoreactive nerve density in tumor tissue 2 weeks
after mice received a single focal RT dose compared to sham radiation in 3 different HNC tumor models.
These results suggest that radiation by itself can induce neuronal sprouting in the oral cavity. This data
combined with previous evidence led to our hypothesis that both the pain and mucositis severity are due to the
negative synergy of radiation-induced sprouting acting on existing hyperinnervation induced by the tumor. The
critical prediction that follows from this hypothesis is that prophylactic denervation of the tumor prior to RT will
reduce both post-treatment pain and mucositis severity. To test this hypothesis, we will use a syngeneic
orthotopic transplant mouse model in tandem with single and multi-fraction RT to characterize nociceptive
behavior and OM as well as RT-induced primary afferent sprouting in vivo (Aim 1) and in vitro (Aim 2).
Additionally, we will use ultrapotent resiniferatoxin to denervate TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons prior to
RT to investigate if prophylactic denervation of the tumor prior to RT can reduce subsequent pain and OM
severity (Aim 3). We believe this proposal will begin to fill an important gap in knowledge in the cancer pain
field and allow for the development of new strategies to treat radiation-associated pain."
10953525,"Background: In response to concerns about access to and quality of care at VA facilities, the VA has begun to
redirect resources toward financing care for Veterans outside of the VA. However, the quality and cost of care
for Veterans that will result from this “make-or-buy” decision remain a scientific unknown, with significant policy
implications for how the VA can optimize Veteran health. Quality and cost of care are particularly influenced by
emergency services, with 13% of care and more than $800 million in yearly costs directed outside the VA.
Objective: Our objective is to identify how quality and cost of care for Veterans are affected by its provision
inside or outside the VA. Studying the quality and costs of VA vs. non-VA care faces the fundamental concern
that patients who receive care at VA facilities may have different levels of underlying health than do those who
receive care outside the VA. Without understanding the consequences of VA vs. non-VA emergency care on
quality and cost, VA policymakers will be unable to direct Veterans to the best care location, nor will they
understand mechanisms behind quality and cost differences between VA vs. non-VA care. Finally, a lack of
knowledge about the effects of VA vs. non-VA care, and about how Veterans access care, prevents
policymakers from predicting quality and cost outcomes for Veterans from policy interventions redirecting
Veterans to non-VA care.
Methods: In Aim 1, we will adopt a quasi-experimental approach, based on instrumental variables (IVs), to
study the effect of the care source on health, utilization, and spending. In preliminary results, we find that VA
EDs reduce elderly Veteran mortality by 50%, or five percentage points. In Aim 2, we will assess the factors
altering the effect of VA vs. non-VA care, evaluating mechanisms behind the effect. For example, we will
investigate whether the VA performs better for Veterans with certain conditions or demographics, such as a
mental health diagnosis or low socioeconomic status. We will assess whether the capacity of local VA options
plays a key role in determining outcomes, and whether coordination of care mediates improved VA outcomes.
In Aim 3, we will evaluate how Veteran use VA and non-VA ED alternatives, and we will use these results and
those in Aims 1 and 2 to simulate quality and cost outcomes under policies for expanding VA capacity,
contracting with non-VA options, and redirecting Veterans to care depending on their characteristics and on
local options.
Expected Outcome: Based on our preliminary results, we expect there to be important differences in health
outcomes and spending between VA and non-VA emergency care. We therefore expect that policymakers can
save thousands of Veteran lives and can improve health outcomes by making decisions based on this
research. The effect of VA care likely differs across Veterans and local conditions. Accordingly, we expect
there to be large additional gains in health and spending outcomes that result from tailoring policies related to
this important make-or-buy decision. Finally, by understanding how outcomes differ across settings and
Veteran types, we expect to contribute to a general understanding about which components of health care
delivery are most critical to achieving excellence. In partnership with the Offices of Policy and Planning,
Community Care, and Emergency Medicine, we anticipate that our findings will be disseminated widely and will
be applied directly to VA decisions and guidelines."

The Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (SCTCT) Program focuses on hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT), cell-mediated immune therapy, and therapy involving stem cells and mesenchymal 
stromal cells (MSCs). The program has 80 members (38 primary, 40 associate, 2 adjunct) from 25 departments. 
The program leader is Dr. Richard Champlin, an accomplished clinical and translational investigator, and co- 
leaders are Dr. Katayoun Rezvani, an expert in cellular therapy, and Dr. Elizabeth Shpall, a leader in stem 
cells, cord blood transplantation, and regenerative medicine. The program's goal is to advance and optimize the 
use of HSCT and cellular therapy for treatment of cancer through translational research bridging stem cell 
biology, hematopoiesis, transplant/tumor immunology, and regenerative medicine. The program has 4 specific 
aims that address 4 themes: Aim 1) to improve the clinical outcomes of hematopoietic transplantation; Aim 2) 
to improve supportive care, particularly to prevent infections and graft-vs-host disease, and also to prevent 
cytokine release syndrome seen with cellular immune therapy; Aim 3) to develop effective cellular 
immunotherapy involving antigen-specific T cells and NK cells; and Aim 4) to define basic biologic mechanisms 
of normal and malignant stem cells and to develop stem cell and MSC-based therapies for tissue regeneration. 
Annual direct peer-reviewed funding totals $9.9M, of which $2.4M (24%) is from NCI grants, including 1 P01 and 
1 U01. Since the last competitive renewal, total annual direct peer-reviewed funding has increased by 19%. MD 
Anderson maintains the largest hematopoietic transplantation program in the nation. Since the last submission, 
the program has published 726 articles: 381 (52%) represent intra-programmatic collaborations, 304 (42%) 
represent inter-programmatic collaborations, and 444 (61%) include external collaborations. Publications have 
appeared in high-impact journals including N Engl J Med and J Clin Invest. Forty-one percent of publications 
have appeared in journals with IF >5, and 15% have been in journals with IF >10. Program members have 
utilized all 14 Shared Resources. Achievements include developing novel approaches for haploidentical and 
cord blood transplants; establishing the efficacy of letermovir to prevent CMV infections after HSCT; developing 
a GMP-compliant ex vivo expansion system for NK cells and producing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK 
cells, which augment antitumor cytotoxicity, and taking these into phase I/II clinical trials; development of novel 
technology for manufacturing CAR T cells; leading the multicenter study leading to FDA approval of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel CAR T cell therapy for lymphoma; identification of novel target antigens for immunotherapy; 
development of a novel monoclonal antibody and CAR T cell that targets aberrantly expressed leukemia antigen 
PR1; selection and expansion of endogenous antitumor T cells; and demonstration that ex vivo fucosylation 
accelerates engraftment of cord blood transplants. These accomplishments are extensions of concepts and 
preclinical studies by program investigators."

Since the last CCSG renewal, Development Funds have supported 1) the recruitment of ten outstanding early 
career investigators, 2) development of two new shared resources and implementation of eight new services in 
existing shared resources, and 3) partial funding for fourteen MD Anderson Multidisciplinary Research Program 
(MRP) awards. The $500,000 of CCSG support for faculty recruitment has leveraged over $5.0M in MD Anderson 
start-up packages and more than $29.6M in new extramural grants. MRP awards provide seed funding of 
$250,000 over 3 years for groups of three or more center members to support planning and development of P01, 
SPORE, and CPRIT multi-investigator grant applications. Since the inception of the program in 1997, MD 
Anderson has invested $11.2M in MRP grants. These awards have been associated with external peer-reviewed 
funding of more than $157M, representing a 14.1-fold return on investment. During the present grant cycle, 17 
proposals have been supported with $625,000 from CCSG Development Funds matched approximately 5:1 with 
institutional funds. This investment of CCSG support has leveraged $18.6M in extramural funding to date, with 
$8.8M from Multi-PI awards and $9.8M from individual investigator awards that resulted from projects supported 
as part of an MRP. Development Funds supported establishing the Functional Genomics Core (FGC) and the 
Assessment, Intervention and Measurement (AIM) core. In the current CCSG application, Development Funds 
are requested to continue support for faculty recruitment and fund additional MRP awards. Support is also 
requested for four developing shared resources: the Oncology Research and Immuno-Monitoring Core (ORION), 
the Microbiome Core Facility, the Shared Decision Making (SDM) Core, and the Metabolomics Core.

Bast; chief scientific officer ad interim, Dr. Giulio Draetta; associate director, Cancer Prevention and Population 
Sciences, Dr. Ernie Hawk; associate director, Clinical and Interdisciplinary Research, Dr. George Wilding; 
associate director, Clinical Research Administration, Dr. Aman Buzdar; associate director, Cancer Health 
Disparities and Community Outreach, Dr. Lorna McNeill; associate director, Career Enhancement, Dr. Michelle

research, education, and prevention activities. The CCSG Executive Committee includes all senior CCSG 
leaders and is chaired by Dr. Pisters, ensuring alignment between the overall institutional leadership structure 
and that of the CCSG. 
MD Anderson uses several external and internal review mechanisms for planning and evaluation to develop and 
improve the cancer center. Funding from the CCSG supports an External Advisory Board (EAB), consisting of 
34 distinguished scientific advisors that meets annually to provide advice to Dr. Pisters, CCSG senior leadership, 
CCSG program leaders, and CCSG shared resource directors. The EAB reviews research programs and shared 
resources to 1) evaluate their productivity, excellence, and alignment with institutional goals; 2) identify gaps in 
scientific expertise or capabilities and suggest options for closing these gaps; 3) consider new programs or 
restructuring of existing programs; 4) assist in recruiting outstanding faculty to the institution; and 5) evaluate the 
extent of collaboration among basic scientists, translational/clinical scientists, and population-based 
investigators, recommending actions to enhance interactivity among these 3 groups. Mechanisms for internal 
review of research programs, shared resources, and research planning include program retreats; clinical 
research protocol and concept reviews; presentations by program leaders and shared resource directors to the 
CCSG Executive Committee and to other leadership groups, including the Community of Chairs meeting of all 
department chairs; and meetings of center leadership with program leaders. Surveys, focus groups, and user 
committees have also reviewed each shared resource during the current grant period. As a prelude to updating 
MD Anderson's Strategic Plan, several Operational Priority task forces have been charged with defining and 
implementing specific near-term actions of immediate importance to the MD Anderson mission. Although the 
operational priorities do not represent a strategic plan, the focus on these priorities has established a foundation 
on which the strategic plan will be developed over the coming year."
10953772,"ABSTRACT CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM) 
The overall goal of Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is to provide high-quality infrastructure 
support for all aspects of clinical protocol research at MD Anderson. The services of the CPDM, directed by Dr. 
Aman Buzdar, Associate Director for Clinical Research Administration, include support of single- and multi- 
center clinical trials through the protocol lifespan; human subject/clinical research education; auditing and 
monitoring active clinical trials; assuring regulatory compliance of IND studies; facilitating protocol financial 
management; and supporting biospecimen research. The CPDM complements the activities of the Protocol 
Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) by supporting the electronic protocol submission and evaluation 
processes. A Protocol Systems Legacy Refresh Project (PSLR) was undertaken in 2016 to migrate functionality 
of the legacy systems to a more contemporary, stable platform. The new electronic health record (EHR) system 
OneConnect (Epic), launched in March 2016, provides an integrated clinical, research, and business platform, 
with 2,188 interventional protocols and 102,134 patients now linked to the EHR. During the last 6 years, the total 
number of protocols managed by CPDM has increased from 5,018 in FY2012 to 5,974 in FY2017 (an increase 
of 19%). New patient registrations to interventional and non-interventional trials have averaged about 35,000 per 
year; however, a significant reduction was noted in the level of FY2016 and FY2017 accruals (24,676 and 26,568, 
respectively), largely due to efforts made to ensure a smooth implementation of OneConnect. Importantly, MD 
Anderson investigators have enrolled 739 patients to the NCI's National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) protocols 
between March 2014 (year 1 of MD Anderson's Lead Academic Participant Site grant) and February 2017. Lastly, 
from March through August 2018, the Office of Clinical Research Administration underwent a substantive 
evaluation of all departments and functions, resulting in a revised organizational structure and greater emphasis 
on integration and accountability across departments to enhance efficiencies within related processes and 
ensure ongoing performance improvements. 
The goals of the CPDM are achieved through the following Specific Aims: 
Aim 1: Clinical Protocol and Data Management: To provide central management and oversight of all aspects of 
clinical protocol research at MD Anderson. 
Aim 2: Data and Safety Monitoring: To provide centralized resources for data monitoring, verifying data validity 
and integrity, and ensuring the safety of study participants in clinical trials. 
Aim 3: Inclusion of Minorities and Women in Clinical Research: To evaluate, monitor, and enhance the 
recruitment and retention of women and minorities in MD Anderson clinical research. 
Aim 4: Inclusion of Children in Clinical Research: To ensure the inclusion of pediatric oncology patients in all 
MD Anderson clinical trials, except if scientifically and ethically inappropriate."
10953773,"ABSTRACT: Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) 
The overall goals of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) are to ensure that all MD Anderson 
human subjects research is of the highest scientific merit and that all approved and/or activated clinical trials 
are completed in a timely manner. The PRMS is supported by 35 staff members (of whom 3 receive a portion 
of support from the CCSG) under the direction of Dr. Aman Buzdar, associate director for clinical research 
administration. Dr. Buzdar oversees all aspects of the PRMS at MD Anderson and reports directly to the 
associate director for clinical and interdisciplinary research, Dr. George Wilding. The PRMS ensures adequate 
internal oversight of the scientific and research aspects of institutional clinical trials through a rigorous review of 
the scientific merit, progress, and priorities of the clinical research protocols conducted by cancer center 
members. The PRMS consists of four Scientific Review Committees (SRC 1–4) and one Psychosocial and 
Behavioral Health Services Research Committee (PBHSRC) that review protocols for scientific merit and 
prioritization. In FY2017, a total of 437 new protocols were submitted to the PRMS (SRC/PBHSRC) peer 
review process, and 382 protocols were reviewed in SRC/PBHSRC meetings, including 342 new interventional 
protocols. The chairs of these committees are also members of the Electronic Protocol Accrual Auditing 
Committee (ePAAC) that selects and monitors all institutional protocols identified as underperforming (e.g., no 
or slow accrual, delayed activations). The ePAAC meets every 6 months and reviews selected protocols, 
including active protocols previously reviewed but requiring a follow-up review at 6 months. A total of 500 
protocol reviews were completed in the last fiscal year (FY2017). An ePAAC subcommittee consisting of 
institutional leadership was recently formed to enhance the quality of the ePAAC review process. This 
subcommittee meets prior to each convened ePAAC meeting to critically review low-performing interventional 
trials that are open for enrollment but have demonstrated consistent challenges in meeting accrual goals post- 
activation (e.g., > 3 consecutive ePAAC reviews) as well as trials that are IRB-approved but have not been 
activated for 6 months or longer. New initiatives include allowing disease-specific programs to select disease- 
specific content experts to conduct the mandatory medical review of SRC-submitted protocols to enhance 
content expertise; documenting types and outcomes (approval/rejection and prioritization) of “local” disease- 
specific protocol reviews; and streamlining protocol activation timelines. In addition, the Office of Clinical 
Research Administration underwent a substantive evaluation of all departments and functions in the spring of 
2018, resulting in a revised organizational structure and greater emphasis on integration and accountability 
across departments to enhance efficiencies within related processes and ensure ongoing performance

10950854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality for most racial and ethnic groups in the
U.S. When immigrants first arrive in the U.S., they have better CVD risk factor profiles than the U.S.-born, but
within 5 to 15 years of living in the U.S., they experience a worsening of their CVD risk factor profiles.
Immigrants of color, specifically some Black, Latinx and Afro-Latinx immigrants, have lower screening,
monitoring, and treatment of CVD risk factors than U.S.-born populations. Lower preventive care utilization
likely contributes to their worsening cardiovascular health. Eliminating disparities in CVD preventive care
utilization is necessary to improve the cardiovascular health trajectory of immigrants of color and lessen the
burden of CVD mortality in the U.S. The research objective of this career development award is to use
epidemiologic, system dynamics, and community-engaged methods to understand how individual and multiple
components of the sociopolitical environment affect Black and Latinx immigrants’ CVD preventive care
utilization. This research will also address current gaps in immigrant health research by focusing on CVD
preventive care utilization outcomes, including Black immigrants in the study population, and using objectively
measured, longitudinal electronic health record data (EHR). The research objective will be achieved through
three novel aims. Aim 1 is to estimate trends and associations between state and county-level immigration
enforcement rates (e.g., community arrests), hate crimes rates, and CVD preventive care utilization among
Black and Latinx immigrant adults using electronic health record data from a nationwide network of community
health centers. Aim 2 is to develop a system map with community stakeholders that graphically depicts
hypothesized causal relationships and feedback loops within the sociopolitical environment that affect
immigrants’ CVD preventive care utilization. Aim 3 is to develop a system dynamics simulation model to
estimate improvements in CVD preventive care utilization as different components of the immigrant-related
sociopolitical environment are manipulated. This multidisciplinary research plan directly addresses NHLBI’s
critical challenge to advance methods of assessing and characterizing exposures to understand differences in
health among populations. The research aims are complemented with a training plan that builds upon the
candidate’s expertise as social epidemiologist to develop the candidate’s expertise in the (1) measurement and
quantification of non-policy components of the sociopolitical environment, (2) analysis of longitudinal EHR data,
(3) use of system dynamics simulation methods, and (4) use of community-engaged research and community-
based system dynamics methods. Together, the research and training plans will prepare the candidate to
become an interdisciplinary, independent research investigator whose career is aimed at improving the
cardiovascular health trajectories of immigrants of color in the U.S."
10950581,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intimate partner aggression (IPA) is a prevalent public health concern that has been tied to numerous negative
consequences. Alcohol use is a well-established contributing cause of IPA. Traditionally conceptualized as a
private form of aggression, most IPA research has focused on risk factors lying within individuals (e.g.,
personality) or within couples (e.g., communication). However, more recently, the need to look at couples'
social contexts has been emphasized, suggesting that alcohol use may interact with couples' contexts to
increase risk for IPA. The proposed project builds directly upon this foundation to test the possibility that
aggression in intimate relationships is governed by the social connections that partners create and maintain.
Specifically, we aim to examine how social isolation and social norm perceptions in in-person versus virtual
social networks moderate the association between alcohol use and IPA. To do so, we will make use of a
validated approach that assesses social networks at the dyadic level, thereby allowing us to capture both
partners' individual social networks as well as the specific ways in which partners' networks overlap or fail to
overlap. We locate our study among couples from low-income communities who do not only represent an
understudied segment of the population, but who also have fewer resources and thus tend to rely more heavily
on their social networks for support. Two-hundred couples (N = 400 individuals) will complete an online survey
on alcohol use and IPA (along with other demographic measures). In addition, each partner will provide the
names of 20 people in their in-person and virtual social networks (network “alters”), information about each
alter, and information about the relationships between each unique pair of alters. These raw data will allow us
to calculate measures of social isolation and social norm perceptions related to alcohol use and IPA. Aims of
the current project are to examine whether associations between alcohol use and IPA will be stronger when
couples are in networks that are more socially isolated (H1a) and when couples hold greater social norm
perceptions for alcohol-related IPA (H1b). Moreover, we will examine whether the effect of social norm
perceptions on the association between alcohol use and IPA depends on social isolation such that couples in
high-density networks with social norms supportive of alcohol-related IPA will report more frequent/severe
alcohol-related IPA (H2a) and couples in high-density networks with social norms NOT supportive of alcohol-
related IPA will report less frequent/severe alcohol-related IPA (H2b). Finally, we aim to explore whether
associations among social isolation, social norm perceptions, alcohol use, and IPA differ as a function of the
proportion of alters who belong to in-person vs virtual social networks. Understanding alcohol-related IPA
within the context of couples' social networks has the potential to make a significant public health impact by
developing an evidence base for interventions that address social networks themselves as a target of change."
10950872,"In humans, mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene account for about 93% of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cases, although recent reports highlight that other genes, such as GANAB, DNAJB11, IFT140, and ALG9, can also cause an ADPKD phenotype. Further adding to the complexity, different types of genetic mutations are present within the PKD1 and PKD2 family and result in varying disease severity. For example, patients with truncating mutations in the PKD1 gene typically have more severe disease compared to patients with non-truncating PKD1 mutations. The combination of these factors has resulted in significant difficulties when attempting to develop therapeutic options, as evidenced by the fact that only one ADPKD drug has been discovered despite decades of research. As such, there is a significant and urgent need to develop new ADPKD-focused therapeutics. One of the major hinderances to the development of new therapeutics is the plethora of animal models that researchers use to study ADPKD. These mouse models include both orthologous (i.e. mutations in Pkd1 or Pkd2 gene) and non-orthologous (i.e. Cys1cpk, Ift88, etc) varieties as well as congenic and inducible models. The fact that these models have different genetic mutations and progress at highly variable rates causes variation in research results. For example, our data indicate that the phenotype and function of immune cells is highly variable, depending on the cystic model used. As such, there is a significant unmet need to understand how the molecular and cellular pathways found in ADPKD patients correlate to mouse models. Further, an understanding of inter- and- intra- cellular signaling networks that are present in ADPKD patients and how they correlate to mouse models is also lacking. In this application, we propose to address these major gaps by generating new single cell RNA sequencing data in the Pax8 rtTA tetocre Pkd1f/f model and merging this newly generated single cell data with our existing mouse PKD single cell atlas. We will also apply our novel deep learning model to the newly created single cell atlas. Using this atlas, we will leverage our knowledge to understand molecular signatures associated with animal models and how they relate to ADPKD patients. We will also identify inter- and- intra- cellular signaling networks that are present in ADPKD patients and investigate whether those signaling networks are conserved in mouse models. Finally, to assist the community, we will generate a user-friendly web portal using our newly generated atlas that will allow researchers to query their genes of interest in mouse models. Overall, we believe that this atlas and tool will serve as a critical resource for PKD researchers and will drive the discovery of novel therapeutics in the ADPKD field."

Opioid medications are highly prescribed for pain management. However, these drugs have considerable abuse
liability. As users increase their opioid intake, they build tolerance against their therapeutic effects. Despite well-
described molecular and cellular mechanisms, tolerance can be reversed when the drug is taken in another
context, a phenomenon known as associative analgesic tolerance. Since associative analgesic tolerance can
lead to escalation of use, it increases the risk of opioid use disorder and fatal overdose. Uncovering neuronal
mechanisms underlying associative analgesic tolerance will inform the development of new treatment options to
mitigate pain while decreasing opioid use and overdoses. Using a novel behavioral training paradigm in mice, I
identified brain regions activated by tolerance. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a crucial role in
contextual learning, nociception, and opioid analgesia, which are aspects of associative tolerance. My
preliminary data indicate that associative tolerance induces the formation of a tolerance-active neuronal
ensemble in the ACC (ACCtol-active). Preliminary studies using fiber photometry and chemogenetic approaches
suggest that ACC activity tracks tolerance state and is necessary for associative tolerance expression. These
data indicate that the ACC may be an orchestrator of associative tolerance. The ACC projects directly to the
spinal cord (SC), and activation of this projection increases nociception. I hypothesize that ACCtol-active neurons
produce associative tolerance by integrating context and drug signals to increase SC excitability in the presence
of opioids. In the K99 phase, I will determine the role of the ACCtol-active ensemble in associative tolerance using
a combination of transgenic tools for ensemble tagging, fiber photometry, and optogenetics. I anticipate that
ACCtol-active activity will be upregulated during tolerance and that the bi-directional modulation of this ensemble
will induce or prevent tolerance. In the R00 phase, I will use viral-mediated tracing and chemogenetic approaches
to determine if ACCtol-active forms functional connections onto the SC and if modulating this pathway can alter
associative tolerance. These experiments will help define the role of specific ACC ensembles and the ACC to
SC circuit in associative analgesic tolerance. In addition to significant scientific advances in understanding the
neural substrates driving contextual control of analgesic tolerance, this K99 proposal will provide me with training
and mentorship to increase my technical and academic skills, building a foundation for my career as an
independent investigator with my research laboratory. During the training phase, I will acquire extensive training
in optical techniques, corticospinal circuit manipulations in vivo, and career development. This training, combined
with my expertise in behavioral pharmacology and addiction models, will equip me to transition to independence
as an Assistant Professor. During the R00 phase, I will apply these techniques to defining corticospinal circuits
involved in associative tolerance. The training and support from this proposal will provide the scientific and
mentorship tools needed for me to establish a successful, independent academic laboratory."
10831563,"Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic in West African countries and causes outbreaks of LF annually. Although 
LASV is one of the most alarming pathogens from a public health perspective, there are few effective vaccines 
or therapeutics against LF. LASV must be handled at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), due to its high pathogenicity. 
This is one of the largest barriers to the development of preventive or therapeutic approaches against LF. 
Furthermore, animal models of LF are limited, which is essential for basic research and development of 
countermeasures. Recently, we developed a novel guinea pig model of LF and found that LASV strain LF2384 
and LF2350 have completely different pathogenic phenotypes in guinea pigs. These two viruses have been 
isolated from human LF patients and pathogenicity of these viruses in guinea pigs is consistent with human 
cases. These unique combinations of immunocompetent rodent model and clinical isolated LASVs are strong 
tools, which allow us to reveal viral factors responsible for pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms 
underlying LASV pathogenicity. 
During K99 phase, we revealed that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) is the determinant factor of 
pathogenic differences between LASV LF2384 and LF2350 by using the reverse genetic system and in vivo 
evaluation. While significant progress has been made in determining the pathogenic viral factor, much less is 
understood about the host response related to LASV pathogenesis. Therefore, in the proposed study, we will 
determine host factors responsible for LASV pathogenicity by using reverse genetics and in vivo experiments, 
and reveal novel molecular mechanisms of LASV L protein underlying LASV pathogenesis by using several 
in vitro molecular techniques. 
We will address this goal through three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will reveal the pathophysiology of 
LASV infection in guinea pigs. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the domain or amino acid residue(s) in L 
responsible for LASV pathogenicity by using reverse genetics and in vivo study. In Specific Aim 3, we will 
unveil molecular mechanisms underlying LASV pathogenicity. Taken together, we hope to address novel 
pathogenic mechanisms of LASV infection, leading to new insights to develop countermeasures against LF."

The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is essential to advancing the science
and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this site proposal is for Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia (CHOP), under the continued leadership of Athena Zuppa and Robert Berg, to continue as a 
clinical site in the new and expanded CPCCRN. Drs. Zuppa and Berg, site-PIs for the past 11 years, are
pediatric intensivists with a wealth of clinical and translational research experience, who have successfully
mentored many junior investigators and produced numerous scientific publications for the CPCCRN. CHOP is
a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children’s hospital located in Philadelphia that serves children and 
families with diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. CHOP, one of the largest children’s
hospitals in the country, is a 559-bed children’s hospital with 49 pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties, a
staff of over 14,585, a faculty of 860, and an annual operating budget of $3.2 billion. CHOP is home to one of
the largest pediatric research programs in the country with more than $147 million in total federal awards and
an annual budget of more than $404 million (FY19). The “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)” trial proposed in this application is a large RCT of
personalized, targeted management of immune function in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The trial 
addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will benefit from granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and children with hyperinflammation will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory
therapy with anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) or tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocking antibody).
Benefit will be evaluated in terms of short- and long-term health-related quality of life. This study builds on
CPCCRN studies that have demonstrated the existence of specific immune phenotypes among children with 
sepsis-induced MODS, and successful reversal of immune suppression by administration of the GM-CSF. It 
also complements the ongoing NICHD R01-funded study investigating the risk factors for immunoparalysis in 
pediatric MODS, of which Dr. Zuppa is a co-PI. This study proposes a transformative approach to personalized 
immune-targeted care of the septic child. Drs. Zuppa and Berg and their research team are thoroughly familiar
with the CPCCRN studies on which this trial is based including methods of sample collection and processing 
for immunophenotyping, dosing and administration of GM-CSF, and collection of short- and long-term sepsis-related outcomes. Drs. Zuppa and Berg, and the ancillary site PI Dr. Neal Thomas have the full support of their
respective institutions to participate in the CPCCRN, and are strongly committed to collaboration with other
CPCCRN sites and the Data Coordinating Center, as well as the inclusion and mentoring of junior investigators
in CPCCRN activities."

In this PL1 application, the UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and our ancillary site Mercy Children’s 
Hospital Kansas City are applying to be two of 24 patient enrolling centers in the new Eunice Kennedy Shriver 
National Institutes of Child Health and Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. 
The first large randomized double blind placebo trial proposed by the steering committee to be undertaken is 
the “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome” trial in 
children. Sepsis occurs when infection overwhelms a person. If the patient’s organs shutdown then the patient 
develops Multiple Organ Dysfunction which can progress to Multiple Organ Failure and death. Sepsis kills one 
in 5 people worldwide with children accounting for the majority of these deaths. Death from sepsis is related in 
part to the patient not being able to fight infection as well as not being able to control inflammation. The 
molecular biology revolution offers us yet unproven hope that we can temper this ancient foe using technology 
that was not available in the past. After attaining parental consents we will draw blood from our children with 
sepsis and send it to Nationwide Children’s Hospital where their immune monitoring laboratory will determine 
whether our children are fighting infection and controlling inflammation well enough to survive, not fighting
infection well enough, or not controlling inflammation well enough. If a child is not fighting infection well 
enough then we will be given masked syringes that will either be placebo (usual care), or recombinant 
Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (immune enhancer) that our nurse will administer in a 
blinded randomization schema for seven days. If a child is not able to control inflammation well enough then 
we will be given masked syringes that will either be placebo (usual care), or recombinant Interleukin 1 receptor 
antagonist protein (anti-inflammatory), or Interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody (anti-inflammatory) that our nurse 
will administer in a blinded adaptive randomized fashion for seven days or one day, respectively. The Data 
Coordinating Center and the Data Safety Monitoring Board will determine whether treatment reduces organ, as 
well as when to stop enrollment for benefit, harm, or futility.
Our two centers are well positioned to aid the success of the new network as 1) we provide 4800 patients per 
year for clinical studies making this planned trial and other future trials feasible; 2) we previously performed the 
pivotal studies on pediatric sepsis induced multiple organ failure that have been used to design the proposed 
trial thus assuring our expertise; and 3) we provide a group of young investigators who will become our field’s 
next generation of independent investigators with mentorship attained through participation in the network."

Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction” interventional trial. The newly organized CPCCRN will expand 
from 7 to 24 clinical sites (12 Primary and 12 Ancillary sites), which will be the largest NIH Pediatric Critical 
Care Research Network to date. We at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) - Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH; 
Primary Site) and Children’s Hospital of San Antonio (CHofSA; Ancillary Site) are very enthusiastic about 
participating as new sites. TCH is the largest freestanding children’s hospital system in the U.S. and is one of 
the best (Rank #4 Children’s Hospital by U.S. News & World Report 2020-2021). We have every pediatric 
subspecialty and offer every service expected in a quaternary pediatric center. We have an extensive track 
record of successful collaboration in multi-center clinical trials such as the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and 
Sepsis Investigators and the Pediatric Heart Network. In combination with our CHofSA partner, we will provide 
access to 163+24 beds with 6000 annual admissions, enabling us to participate fully in the “Personalized 
Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MODS)” trial described in the Overall 
Component of this application. Our sites have several highly talented young faculty, who have career 
development grants with innovative translational research projects, and will contribute to the success of 
CPCCRN. For example, Dr. Desai (K12 recipient) pioneered the field of pediatric cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and 
bile acid-myocardial interaction (cholecardia). His aim is to improve outcomes of pediatric liver failure through 
decreasing circulating pathologic bile acids by novel bile acid sequestrants and blood purification techniques. 
Dr. Lam (K08 recipient) develops novel protein to attenuate inflammation through inhibiting leukocyte-platelet-endothelial interactions. His aim is to improve outcomes in pediatric liver failure and more recently, COVID19-
induced inflammation. Dr. Nguyen, our Co-Investigator, is R01 funded to study mechanisms of sepsis-induced 
MODS and to develop targeted novel agent for this deadly disease. His aim is to obtain Investigational New 
Drug status for his novel A2 Protein from the Food and Drug Administration, and subsequently, to enter A2 
Protein in clinical trials such as CPCCRN. Dr. Arikan, our site Principle Investigator, plans to study the impact 
of extracorporeal therapies in immunomodulation and pharmacokinetics of novel therapeutics to build on her 
previous work in pediatric MODS with a special emphasis on interaction of acute kidney injury, acquired

Discovery of new therapeutic approaches to save the lives and improve the recovery of children with critical 
illnesses can have profound effects on the child, the family and the overall health care system. In the past 
decades, studies – often from a single center or a small number of centers - have led to intriguing hypotheses 
that may result in benefits for a wide number of conditions. However, fully testing these putative therapies has 
been hampered by an inability to enroll adequate number of subjects, mobilize sufficient trained personnel to 
conduct the study and garner enough resources to fully answer the question. Children’s National Hospital (CNH) 
is enthusiastic to join the new Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Network (CPCCRN) to perform the innovative 
studies for children with multiple organ failure after sepsis.
CNH has been proud to be a part of the 3 previous CPCCRN cycles starting in 2004. As a clinical center with 
over 4000 ICU admissions each year while serving a diverse community in the Washington/Maryland/Virginia 
region, we stand uniquely poised to enroll subjects in innovative clinical studies. By including children from our 
center, from our ancillary site (Children’s Hospital of Richmond [CHoR]) and the other 22 sites within this new 
CPCCRN, sufficient numbers of children will be available for enrollment and ensure the generalizability of the 
findings. We bring an experienced research team to this new project. Our PI team is experienced at research, 
specialists in neurological and cardiac critical care and leaders at CNH. In these capacities, they will identify and 
support young investigators to participate in CPCCRN activities while also ensuring the success of the project(s) 
within CPCCRN. The PIs have been deeply involved with the preliminary studies that have led up to the 
proposed studies of personalized medicine to treat children with multiple organ failure. We believe this novel 
approach will finally advance the field past the hurdle of only being able to use “supportive” care for such patients 
and lead to substantial improvements in overall function, quality of life and family functioning. Moreover, we 
believe that new, funded projects can be brought into CPCCRN by investigators within our center to make further 
advances in the field of pediatric critical care."

10951175,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Indirect-detection x-ray Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) use a scintillator to convert x-rays to light, which is then detected by
photodiodes coupled to readout electronics. During the past two decades, the latter evolved from noisy amorphous Silicon
arrays with coarse pixels (>130 µm) to low-noise CMOS sensors with very fine pixels (<100 µm). There has been
comparatively little innovation in the scintillator, which is now the principal factor limiting FPD spatial resolution. The
scintillator bur is caused by the lateral spread of light between the x-ray interaction site and the photodiodes.
To overcome this challenge, we propose to use laser ablation to pixelate the scintillator film – here, a ~700 µm thick CsI:Tl
commonly used in FPDs - at a pitch matching the readout array. We will develop Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) techniques
to coat the high-aspect ratio pixelation grooves with an optimized combination of absorptive and reflective layers to
ensure that there is no inter-pixel cross-talk and that the majority of x-ray interaction light is directed towards the
photodiodes. To mitigate signal losses due to the loss of film volume in pixelation grooves, we will use a novel crystalline
form of micro-columnar CsI:Tl (CMS CsI:Tl) which enhances the sensor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by exploiting the higher
density and increased transparency of the crystalline material.
The proposed scintillator has the potential to substantially improve the performance of modern FPDs by enabling ultra-
high spatial resolution imaging without sacrificing x-ray attenuation provided by using a relatively thick CsI:Tl. We have
performed initial experimental studies of this approach and found ~20% better limiting spatial resolution than
conventional detectors. This proposal will build on this early work by (i) refining the pixelation technique to obtain even
thinner pixel grooves for better detection efficiency, and (ii) optimizing the CMS deposition process and the inter-pixel
coatings for improved light output.
Our technology will benefit applications where visualization of ~100 µm details is desired, but currently challenged by
image noise due to body size and/or patient dose: 2D and 3D angiography, pulmonology, breast, otolaryngology imaging,
and orthopedics. For an initial demonstration of potential clinical utility, we target quantitative in vivo assessment of bone
microarchitecture in osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA). We will pursue the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Optimize the pixelation process to maximize spatial resolution, detection efficiency, and brightness of the pixelated
CsI:Tl films. Achieve light yield approaching that of a conventional scintillator and improved SNR for ~100 µm features.
Aim 2: Validation in quantitative high-resolution Cone Beam CT of trabecular bone. Characterize of the pixelated detector
in terms of fundamental metrics of CBCT imaging performance and in 3D trabecular measurements (bone volume,
trabecular thickness and spacing) in a range of body sites pertinent to OA and OP.
The results will inform future development of other possible applications of FPDs based on pixelated scintillators with high
detective efficiency, e.g. in interventional radiology and pulmonary imaging."
10951176,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Type 2 diabetes increases a person’s risk for cognitive impairment syndromes including, cognitive
decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s Disease and its related dementias. However, our ability to
identify who among people living with type 2 diabetes is most likely to develop a cognitive impairment syndrome
is limited because we have an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cognitive
issues in people with type 2 diabetes. A better understanding of these molecular mechanisms can help to identify
biomarkers that predict risk for cognitive impairment syndromes.
 Proteomic analyses provide an efficient and comprehensive approach to identifying molecular
mechanisms of disease and are also recognized as an effective platform for biomarker discovery. However, to
date, few human studies have applied proteomic approaches to investigate the mechanisms that drive
development of cognitive impairment syndromes in people living with type 2 diabetes. Thus, additional proteomic
studies are critically needed to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment syndromes in
people with type 2 diabetes, so to identify proteins that can be used as biomarkers of risk.
 The overarching goal of this pilot project is to use proteomic analyses to examine differences in plasma
proteins and protein networks in people with type 2 diabetes, who do and do not develop mild cognitive
impairment, as a first step toward identifying potential risk biomarkers for cognitive impairment syndromes in
people with type 2 diabetes. First, to achieve this goal, our primary aim is to identify proteins associated with
newly diagnosed mild cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes (Aim 1). Additionally, we aim to provide
further depth to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the underlying neuropathology of mild
cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes. Thus, we will determine whether proteins associated with
mild cognitive impairment in Aim 1 also relate to preclinical plasma-based biomarkers of neurodegenerative
disease and Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology in people with type 2 diabetes (Aim 2).
 Results from this pilot study will reveal potential mechanisms by which people with type 2 diabetes
develop cognitive impairment syndromes. Thus, providing important insights that could inform use of plasma-
derived protein biomarkers for risk stratification of people with type 2 diabetes, and possible protein targets for
development of novel therapeutics and treatment strategies to mitigate risk of cognitive impairment syndromes
in people with type 2 diabetes."
10949665,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Over the past 25 years, the United States (US) has witnessed a fourfold increase in its prison and jail
population, with nearly 70-90% coming from minority and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. To illustrate, one
out of every three Black males and one out of every six Hispanic males born in 2001 are projected to experience
incarceration during their lifetimes, in stark contrast to just one out of seventeen White males. There is a glaring
lack of data on their surgical care, and what is known is deeply troubling. This study, titled 'Unlocking Equity:
Validating Methodologies and Evaluating Surgical Care for Incarcerated Individuals,' seeks to deepen our
understanding of the healthcare of incarcerated individuals and ultimately impact the existing disparities in
mortality and timely surgical care.
 Inmates possess the unique constitutional right to healthcare, yet the extent, quality, and outcomes after
surgery are unknown. The reasons for this knowledge gap are complex, none the least of which is the difficulty
of identifying these patients in healthcare databases. Identifying incarcerated individuals in healthcare
databases relies on the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes, Z65.1 (""imprisonment and
other incarceration"") and Y92.14x (""prison as the place of occurrence of the external cause"") or the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality admission source code. These codes are used ubiquitously in healthcare
databases, but their validity is unestablished. To address these critical gaps in the surgical care of incarcerated
individuals, our study has two aims. In Aim 1, we will validate methods for identifying incarcerated patients in
electronic medical records (EMR) and claims databases. The accuracy of these codes is crucial for gaining
insights into healthcare delivery for incarcerated individuals requiring surgery and in-hospital medical care. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate the timeliness of surgical care and outcomes (morbidity, mortality) of incarcerated patients
in New York State undergoing inpatient surgery using validated codes.
 This study examines the public health of incarcerated individuals, a group that predominantly comes from
underserved and disadvantaged communities. It introduces an innovative method for identifying incarcerated
patients in healthcare databases, serving as an invaluable model for future research. Our multidisciplinary
investigator team and Expert Advisory Panel have expertise in the healthcare of incarcerated individuals, health
outcomes, surgical care, disparities, and policy evaluations which ensures the validity of the study. In essence,
this research addresses pressing issues in incarcerated healthcare and provides a methodological framework to
inform future studies, facilitating informed policy decisions and improved healthcare practices for an underserved
community."
10949738,"Activated macrophages and microglia are key players in the innate response in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). They are closely associated with b-amyloid deposits in brains from AD patients and
AD mouse models. Emerging evidence revealed that activated microglia/macrophages play dual roles in AD
pathogenesis: anti-inflammatory and protective (M2-like) to decrease b-amyloid accumulation by phagocytosis
or clearance at the early/preclinical stage, and proinflammatory at the clinical stage. Modulation of
macrophages/microglia activation to an anti-inflammatory phenotype has become a promising therapeutic
strategy. A noninvasive imaging method to detect the anti-inflammatory macrophages/microglia would enable a
better understanding of the key roles these cells play in AD pathogenesis and monitoring of therapeutic effects
of potential novel therapies modulating macrophages/microglia phenotype. However, most of the current
imaging methods do not distinguish between these different phenotypes (e.g., iron oxide nanoparticles, DFG
PET or translocator protein PET), or only target damaging cells (e.g., myeloperoxidase (MPO) imaging), or
cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, there is an unmet need for a non-invasive imaging method to
detect anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages in AD with the ability to cross the BBB. The mannose receptor
(CD206) is a surface marker of M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages/microglia. In AD, CD206+ microglia
closely co-localize with b-amyloid deposits and pathological tau. Anti-inflammatory treatment has been shown
to polarize microglia to CD206+ phenotype and reduce b-amyloid accumulation. As such, an imaging probe
targeting CD206 could provide a useful tool to track these CD206+ cells noninvasively. We have developed a
CD206-specific MRI agent (MannGdFish) that can map and track the changes of CD206+ macrophages in
rodent models of wound healing and tumor. However, MannGdFish cannot cross the BBB which limits its
application in the brain. We hypothesize that we can develop an [18F]-labeled amphiphilic PET probe with the
ability to cross the BBB by conjugating the hydrophilic CD206-targeted binding motif of MannGdFish to
hydrophobic lipid chains at different lengths to modulate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance and serum
affinity. We will evaluate candidate probes’ specificity and the ability to cross the BBB to identify an optimal
probe. We will validate the optimal probe by imaging the changes of CD206+ microglia/macrophages in
transgenic 5xFAD mice at 2 months (early stage) and 6 months (symptomatic stage), and correlate the
imaging data with the water maze test, ex vivo biochemical, flow cytometry and immunohistological results.
The output of this proposal will be a novel, highly specific PET probe that can cross the BBB to track CD206+
microglia/macrophages in AD and other neurological diseases. Because of the lower translational cost of PET
probes, the results of this work may lead to near-future translational and first-in-human studies."

This K38 award is designed to support Dr. Sonali Bracken’s research training and accelerate her path to an
independent research career in the field of autoimmunity. Dr. Bracken is a clinical rheumatologist at Duke
University with a Ph.D. in Immunology. Her long-term goal is to improve the health and longevity of patients
with autoimmune, fibroproliferative disorders through the development of B cell-targeted therapies. Through
this award, Dr. Bracken will develop expertise in the mechanisms of fibrosis, expand her proficiency in
fundamental immunological laboratory techniques, and build foundational skills in data analysis and laboratory
management. Her research progress and career development will be overseen by a multidisciplinary
mentorship team headed by both Dr. Stefanie Sarantopoulos, an expert in bone marrow transplant and B cell
signaling, and Dr. Scott Palmer, an expert in the field of lung fibrosis and transplantation. Dr. Bracken will also
benefit from a wealth of resources available through Duke University that are aimed at training physician
scientist leaders. The objective of this application is to delineate immune pathways that contribute to lung
fibrosis in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that results from multiorgan inflammation and
fibrosis. In up to twenty percent of patients with cGVHD, fibrosis impacts the lungs and can cause respiratory
failure. B cells are known contributors to the pathogenesis of cGVHD. The central hypothesis of this application
is that B cells and fibroblasts undergo crosstalk that leads to bidirectional cellular activation and ultimately
promotes lung fibrosis. This hypothesis will be investigated via two aims, the first of which will examine the
mechanisms by which hyperactive Toll Like Receptor 7 signaling in B cells drives fibroblast activation in the
lung. This will be accomplished through 1) co-culture assays using cGVHD patient B cells and primary human
lung fibroblasts 2) immunofluorescence microscopy in explanted cGVHD patient lung tissue samples and 3)
use of a well-characterized cGVHD mouse model that permits selective deletion of Toll Like Receptor 7
signaling pathway components in donor B cells. The second aim will examine the role of the fibroblast
extracellular matrix component hyaluronan in activating cGVHD B cells from the lung through the CD44
receptor using in vitro stimulation assays. It will also examine the differential effects of high- and low-molecular
weight hyaluronan on lung cGVHD severity using a mouse model. Altogether, these experiments are expected
to provide important insights about the role of B cells in promoting fibrosis in lung cGVHD. Ultimately, this
knowledge can be utilized to therapeutically target specific points of B cell-fibroblast crosstalk that are critical
for promoting fibrosis in cGVHD. It is likely that the knowledge gained from this proposal will also be relevant to
mechanisms that drive lung fibrosis in autoimmune connective tissue disease. Furthermore, this proposal will
position the candidate to submit a K08 Career Development Award during the final year of the award period."

 Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), recurrent medulloblastoma (MB),
and recurrent ependymoma are devastating diseases. The median overall survival (OS) of these diagnoses
are 8 to 12 months. Brain cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in patients aged 0-19 and
improvements in survival remain elusive. Current treatments for these malignant tumors typically entail surgical
resection or biopsy, radiation, and sometimes chemotherapy. These treatments are rarely curative. There is a
profound knowledge gap in understanding how to improve the survival and quality of life in children with these
malignant brain tumors.
 In contrast to conventional chemotherapy/radiation, immunotherapy offers a more precise treatment
approach. The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen, pp65, is found in the majority of HGG and MB but not
in adjacent brain, making it a promising immunotherapeutic target. Limited data from multiple labs suggests
CMV antigens may also be present in ependymoma. However, this has not been confirmed in large samples
nor is it known if CMV antigens are preferentially expressed in certain ependymoma subtypes.
 Preliminary results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of a peptide vaccine directed at pp65 (PEP-CMV) to
treat recurrent pHGG/DMG and MB has demonstrated significant antigen-specific T cell immune responses
and prolonged clinical/imaging responses in many patients. Additionally, in an ongoing study of PEP-CMV in
adults with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma, there was a significant increase in the cytokine/chemokines G-CSF,
GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-8, MIP1-α, and TNF-α levels after PEP-CMV delivery. The addition of
checkpoint blockade has not been explored in immunotherapies targeting CMV, however, it has enhanced the
immunogenicity of cancer vaccines in preclinical brain tumor models other non-brain solid tumors.
 We hypothesize that CMV antigens are present in a subset of ependymomas and adding checkpoint
blockade to PEP-CMV will increase T cell and cytokine responses. Our objectives of this pilot study are to 1)
determine if ependymoma is a putative target of PEP-CMV and 2) improve the immunogenicity of PEP-CMV.
To attain the overall objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued. Aim 1: Establish if CMV antigens
are expressed in ependymoma. Utilizing validated and replicated methods, we will analyze 60 human
ependymoma specimens for expression of CMV antigens. Aim 2: Establish if checkpoint blockade will increase
the immunogenicity of PEP-CMV. To accomplish this, we will use a validated transgenic HLA-A2 mouse model
to determine if IFN-γ generation via ELISpot and cytokine generation responses are increased by adding
checkpoint blockade. Our long-term objective is to use data from this pilot study to conduct a Phase 1 clinical
trial of PEP-CMV plus checkpoint blockade for the treatment of recurrent ependymoma, MB, and pHGG/DMG."
10954384,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal cancer of the brain showing little change in survival over decades of therapeutic
trials. Development of oncolytic viruses (OV) is iterative and extends from our first description of a genetically-
engineered OV to our G-series of oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs), ie., G47, which has been shown
to be both efficacious for GBM and safe for use in the human brain. Our overarching hypothesis is that
increased efficacy will be produced by simultaneously stimulating intratumoral immune responses with an IL-
12-expressing oHSV and diminishing the immune suppression of adenosine (ADO) in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) of GBM. The extracellular ADO (eADO) pathway is important to both tumor cells and
immune cells. Indeed, eADO in the TME has been considered an immune checkpoint that can regulate both
innate and adaptive immunity. Much of eADO is produced by plasma membrane ectonucleotidases CD39 and
CD73, and metabolized by ADO degrading enzymes (ADE). Elevated ADO levels are strongly
immunosuppressive in tumors; inhibiting cytotoxic T-cells (CTL), tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and
NK cells by binding to the ADO receptor A2aR and also augmenting the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs.
The TME of tumors can have ADO levels many logs higher than normal tissues and high eADO can induce
aggressive traits in GBM. Moreover, hypoxia is common in GBM and hypoxia induces release of ATP or
NAD+, both possible sources of ADO. ADO also stimulates angiogenesis, a common feature of GBM. In light
of this, it should be noted that our oHSV G47-IL12, has potent anti-angiogenic activity, is not inhibited by
hypoxia, and is immunotherapeutic. The possibility of improving tumor therapy by blocking ADO has been
demonstrated in mice but thus far has had only limited success in the clinic for cancer in general and has only
minimally been explored for GBM. Nonetheless, multiple potential targets exist. Among the targets shown to
influence the immunosuppressive activities of ADO are CD39, CD73, nucleoside transporters such as ENT-1,
ADO receptors such as A2aR, and the ADEs, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosine kinase (ADK).
Therefore, we plan to determine if agents inhibiting CD39, CD73, or A2aR or a combination of these can act
synergistically in vitro to improve GBM immunovirotherapy. For this, we have a panel of 5 non-immunogenic
mouse glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) lines with variable expression of the ADO pathway. These and
human GSCs and immune cells will be used to interrogate ADO signaling, as well as the effects of CD39,
CD73, and A2aR inhibitors in vitro. Next, we plan to make two novel oHSVs expressing ADA or ADK and test
their effects both in vitro and in vivo in immunocompetent mice. Finally, we hypothesize that the combination of
intratumoral G47mIL12 or G47mIL12ADE plus systemic inhibitors of the ADO pathway can synergistically
improve efficacy in vivo. These studies should identify an oHSV-ADO pathway inhibitor combination that
warrants translation to the clinic for GBM patients."

Behavioral control is a fundamental component of executive control and requires the ability to suppress
actions, thoughts, and desires. Deficits in behavioral control are thought to be at the core of many public health
concerns in the United States. Nevertheless, currently little is known about the mechanisms underlying
behavioral control and what leads to failures of control. Response inhibition and self-control, two key aspects of
behavioral control, are often hypothesized to be the result of a uniform neuronal mechanism for impulse
control, but they have typically been studied independently, and it is possible that the brain contains separate
neuronal mechanisms for motor and motivational control. Neuroimaging and lesion studies in humans
have implicated a network of prefrontal regions in self-control, as well inhibitory motor control, including frontal
eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). However, it is not clear if the neuronal
circuits of motor control and self-control are identical or separate. In our proposed experiments, we will
investigate prefrontal mechanisms for self-control and response inhibition in these areas. Comparing the
mechanisms for both types of control requires tasks that allow identification of signals involved in response
inhibition and self-control. We will train monkeys both in a novel self-control task developed by us (requiring
motivational control) and in the classic stop signal task (requiring motor control). This will allow us to identify
circuit level mechanisms of self-control and response inhibition. Our Aim 1 is to determine if the neural
mechanisms of response inhibition and self-control in prefrontal cortex are shared or distinct. We will
record the neural activity of multiple neurons in FEF, SEF, preSMA, DLPFC and VLPFC. By testing identical
sets of prefrontal neurons in both tasks, we will identify neuronal activity underlying each control mechanism
and determine if identical or separate circuits are responsible for both forms of executive control. Our Aim 2 is
to determine if different areas in prefrontal cortex causally contribute to response inhibition and self-
control. Preliminary data show that inactivation of SEF by cooling will bias behavioral outcomes toward
failures of self-control. This indicates a causal role of SEF in self-control. We will systematically test the causal
role of FEF, SEF, preSMA, DLPFC and VLPFC in response inhibition and self-control, by inactivating each of
these areas and observe behavior in the delayed gratification and stop signal tasks. Inactivating one area,
while simultaneous recording in other areas will determine if neuronal representations of response inhibition or
self-control are causally dependent on activity in other parts of the network of prefrontal regions."
10941458,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite recent experimental advances in high-dimensional time-course data generation and accompanying
inferential statistical approaches, we still lack the ability to reliably estimate the time-dynamical adaptation
mechanisms that biological systems utilize to navigate varying environments. The major obstacle preventing a
mechanistic understanding of dynamic adaptation is an absence of hybrid theory- and data-driven models that
integrate biological mechanisms of adaptation with their effects on state transitions and associated fitness in a
variable environment. By leveraging my prior expertise in modeling stochastic biological processes and building
upon our recent mathematical characterization of optimized adaptation strategies, this research project will
develop a comprehensive computational framework to address this need. In the next five to ten years, we will
address three main research goals: 1) design a mathematical framework for tracking the effects of variable, time-
dependent adaptation, 2) validate computational models accounting for dynamic adaptability using time-course
gene expression and sequencing data, and; 3) apply, in close experimental and clinical collaboration, the
modeling framework to understand disease-specific adaptability through antigen signatures that evolve in the
presence of an adaptive T cell immune repertoire. Since dynamic adaptation is fundamental to many biological
processes with therapeutic implications for treatment resistance, this modeling framework will be useful for
predicting the time-dependent effects of prior environmental histories on the phenotypic outcome of adaptive
systems. Such predictions will also enable additional in silico evaluation of the effects of intervention on disease
outcome. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the general principals governing dynamic
adaptation in biological systems and provide a more comprehensive characterization of the role of antigenic
adaptability in the setting of a time-varying immune environment."

This Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop a high-throughput easy-to-use cell sorter
MagiCyte™ to rapidly and precisely sort intact and viable rare cells at single-cell resolution.
Single-cell sorting from a heterogeneous cell population has been essential to life science applications such as
monoclonal antibody production and cell line development. Recently, with the rapid growth of precision
medicine, there has also been a strong demand for single-cell sorting technologies for rare cells, such as
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating fetal cells, stem cells and antigen-specific T- or B-cells. However,
collecting such rare cells at single-cell resolution to meet the requirements of single-cell analysis is not feasible
for conventional single-cell sorting techniques. Micromanipulation and serial dilution are time consuming and
low-throughput, while fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) suffers from remarkable cell loss and is
inefficient in isolating rare cells. In addition, many such techniques require cell fixation and/or fluorescent
staining, which decreases cell viability and thus prohibits many downstream molecular analyses, as well as
and cell culture. As such, there is an unaddressed need for high throughput single-cell sorting of rare cells.
We aim to develop a high-throughput chip-based cytometer MagiCyte™ to rapidly isolate, identify and sort
single intact and viable target cells from heterogeneous cell population. The core component of MagiCyte is a
semiconductor chip MagiChip™ which is used for single cell identification and single cell sorting. In this fast-
track project, we will first develop the control software and demonstrate automated single-cell sorting; In Phase
II, we will develop the next-generation MagiChip, build the MagiCyte beta product and validate the system on
clinical samples with our collaborators."
10945488,"In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), skin pathophysiology is linked to autoimmunity. Patients are
photosensitive, able to develop inflammatory skin lesions with even ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
exposure, which can also induce systemic disease flares. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanisms
that link cutaneous photosensitivity with systemic autoimmunity, focusing on skin regulation and the
consequences on draining lymph node function. Dermal lymphatic vessels serve to remove interstitial fluid
from skin and regulate downstream lymph nodes, the latter by transporting antigens and cells and by directly
regulating migrating immune cells. We recently showed that compromised lymphatic flow contributes to
increased skin inflammation and lymph node B cell responses in lupus. This proposal investigates
mechanisms that regulate lymphatic function to better understand the basis of the dysfunction in
disease. Preliminary data show that Langerin-DTA (Lang-DTA) mice constitutively lacking Langerhans cells
(LCs) have reduced dermal lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) numbers, altered LEC phenotype, and poor
lymphatic flow, reflecting LEC apoptosis and failure to develop postnatally from 3 weeks of age on. In
adulthood, LCs are required to maintain dermal LEC numbers during ultraviolet radiation-induced inflammation.
The postnatal lymphatic expansion depends on both vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and
placental growth factor (PGF). Keratinocytes are major VEGF-C expressors in skin and LCs bind VEGF-C in a
manner that is reduced with anti-Langerin or with myeloid loss of heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1
(HS2ST1). We further show that restoring postnatal lymphatic expansion with VEGF-C+PGF reduces the
known increased T cell priming in response to a contact sensitizer in Lang-DTA mice. The increased T cell
priming is associated with reduced LEC IDO1 expression and increased maturation of skin-derived migratory
dendritic cells, suggesting that dysregulation of the LC-LEC axis compromises the immune regulatory function
of LECs. Together, the data lead to a model of an LC-LEC axis whereby LCs are “licensed” to regulate
postnatal LEC development that functions to regulate immunity in adulthood, and this axis is recapitulated
during inflammation in adulthood. We hypothesize that LCs are licensed for lymphatic regulation by
keratinocyte provision of VEGF-C and LC Langerin and HS2ST1, presumably to bind and transport VEGF-C to
the dermal lymphatics, that this LC-mediated regulation shapes tolerogenic programs in LECs, and that a
dysfunctional LC-LEC axis contributes to lymphatic dysfunction in SLE. The aims are to 1) delineate the
determinants of LC licensing for lymphatic regulation, 2) identify the tolerogenic programs in LECs that are
regulated by LCs, and 3) understand the extent to which lymphatic dysfunction in SLE models is related to a
dysfunctional LC-LEC axis. This study will help us understand how skin function modulates immunity across
time and in disease."
10945609,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Schizophrenia (SCZ) is among the most severe and disabling medical conditions worldwide, yet the brain alterations
that lead to the symptoms of SCZ remain unknown and the treatments are currently limited to dopaminergic (D2
receptor modulating) medications for their antipsychotic properties. Antipsychotic medications have incomplete efficacy
and carry a substantial side effect burden. There is thus an imperative to characterize non-dopaminergic markers to
guide diagnosis and treatment of SCZ.
 One such promising marker to explore is the vesicular acetylcholinergic transporter (VAChT), levels of which provide
a critical indicator of cholinergic terminal activity in the brain. Although the pathophysiology by which the cholinergic
system may mediate SCZ symptoms is unclear, an increasing body of evidence suggests that presynaptic cholinergic
transmission may be involved in multiple disabling features of SCZ and new drugs directed at presynaptic cholinergic
activity show promise in the treatment of SCZ, including an M1/M4 muscarinic agonist therapeutic in Phase 3 trials which
was recently reported to be effective in significantly reducing positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, and
improving cognitive impairment, in patients with SCZ. We have exciting preliminary data using a new radiotracer that
targets VAChT ([18F]-VAT) with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging suggesting that cortical, hippocampal, and
thalamic VAChT strongly relates to positive psychotic symptoms and working memory deficits in patients with SCZ.
 The proposed 5-year R01 study aims to replicate and extend these observations relating in vivo cholinergic
transmission to two of the most disabling features of SCZ. We will measure VAChT using PET with [18F]-VAT VT in a new,
larger sample of 40 patients with SCZ – 20 patients on antipsychotic medication and 20 unmedicated patients – and 20
healthy controls; and examine VAChT’s relationships among and within groups with clinical pathology.
 If replicated and substantiated in a larger cohort, VAChT could be a reliable biological indicator of multiple key
features of SCZ that may serve as a marker of illness severity and a potentially valuable tool for the development of
biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of SCZ."
10947001,"Despite the substantial decrease in the prevalence of smoking over the past 50 years, there are persistent
and significant disparities in tobacco use among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals. The
prevalence of cigarette use in TGD individuals is 45.7 - 62.3%, compared to 39.8% in cisgender individuals.1
There are also disparities in e-cigarette use among TGD people relative to cisgender adults (26.5% vs. 5.5% in
transgender and cisgender men, respectively).2 Transgender individuals may be particularly vulnerable to the
consequences of tobacco use, as hormone therapy among those who smoke increases heart disease risk,3 and
smoking may hinder recovery from gender-affirming surgeries.4
 Stigma, discrimination, gender dysphoria, and other gender minority stressors contribute to tobacco use
disparities. Enacted stigma and discrimination toward TGD individuals are common (reported by over 75% of
participants in some samples5), and experiencing stigma or discrimination increases the odds of current cigarette
smoking, e-cigarette use/vaping, and dual use among TGD people.6 Gender dysphoria and gender minority
stress may also lead to and/or exacerbate disparities in anxiety and depression,7 which are major impediments
to smoking cessation8 that are more prevalent among TGD than cisgender individuals.9 Anxiety symptoms co-
occur with smoking at high rates and significantly impair cessation success.10,11 Similarly, depressed mood and
major depressive disorder, both more common among individuals who smoke than among those who do not,12–
14 are associated with reduced odds of cessation.15 Therefore, gender minority stress and high prevalence rates
of anxiety and depression render TGD individuals particularly vulnerable to smoking cessation difficulties.
 A tailored smoking cessation intervention that builds cognitive behavioral skills for cessation as
well as reduces gender minority stress and associated anxiety and depression symptoms has strong
potential to mitigate tobacco use disparities among TGD individuals. We propose to adapt an existing
smoking cessation intervention (known as QUIT16) to address the unique needs of TGD people. In focus groups
with TGD individuals who use tobacco (N = up to 32) and providers (N = 8), we will explore the ways in which
gender minority stressors and associated anxiety/depression compromise cessation as well as identify content
in the current version of the QUIT intervention that does and does not meet their needs. Providers will also
comment on anticipated implementation barriers. Following the ADAPT-ITT model, the qualitative data will inform
the adaptation of the intervention. We will then test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention
(QUIT+) in a pilot RCT (N = 60); we will also assess for signals of clinically meaningful change in biologically
verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence, average number of cigarettes smoked, gender minority stress,
anxiety and depression symptoms, and distress tolerance. If deemed to be feasible and acceptable, the
intervention will be ready for a hybrid efficacy/effectiveness trial."
10948887,"Veteran suicides, attempts and suicidal ideation (SI) remain of urgent concern to the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA). Recent reports indicate that approximately half of veteran suicides take place within 1
month of the decedent’s final VHA encounter, with one quarter occurring within 1 week. This provides a
temporal window of opportunity to intervene, and necessitates development of a rapid-acting treatment for
veterans with SI. Intravenous ketamine is the prototypical anti-suicidal drug, that rapidly reduces SI in some
patients. However, there are concerns regarding ketamine’s toxicity in both veterans, and military personnel.
These include ketamine’s potential for toxicity and misuse, and the brief duration of anti-suicidal effect. The
ideal VHA anti-suicidal treatment: 1) Could be administered orally rather than intravenously; 2) Would achieve
“target engagement” with the same neural substrates as ketamine; 3) Would have fewer risks; and 4) Would
have a longer duration of action and/or a more durable antisuicidal effect. Therefore this study will test the
novel intervention uridine as a rapid-acting oral treatment for veterans with SI. As described in the proposal,
uridine’s potential to fill this role lies in the broad overlap in the brain mechanisms and neural effects shared by
uridine, ketamine and the anti-suicidal drug lithium. The reason for this surprising commonality may lie in the
fact that ketamine’s mechanism-of-action dependent on activation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis – and the
fact that uridine is the endogenous circulating pyrimidine in man. To initiate testing of uridine for veterans with
SI, we will conduct a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of uridine 2000 mg daily for
veterans with SI. To make the study more informative, translational neuroimaging is integrated into the protocol
to identify biomarkers of SI. Veterans will undergo proton-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS)
imaging at baseline, with scans repeated after 1 week of treatment, in pursuit of a neurochemical biosignature
of rapid SI reduction. Upon completion of the four-week placebo-controlled phase, participants will enter the
six-month open-label phase of the study. The open-label phase will accomplish two goals: 1) To evaluate the
durability of uridine’s anti-suicidal effect in uridine responders; and 2) To ensure that veterans initially
randomized to placebo have a full and fair opportunity to benefit from active treatment. In summary, while
piloting a much-needed alternative to intravenous ketamine for suicidal veterans, this research also aims to
participate in establishing the neurochemical biomarkers of suicidal ideation, and treatment response."
10946793,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of prostate cancer-related mortality and remains a
considerable challenge in developing effective and durable therapies. Interestingly, 80% of all patients with
metastatic prostate cancer (PC) develop bone metastases, dropping their 5-year survival to 26-30%, which
underscores the need to reveal, understand, and exploit the unique cellular pathways, mechanisms, and
oncogenic events that drive the initiation, formation, and maintenance of PC bone metastases. Essential to the
development and preclinical screening of novel therapeutic technologies, there is an urgent need for a reliable
and convenient in vitro/in vivo cellular model that recapitulates the unique PC bone metastatic environment.
Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is expressed on the epithelium of nearly all PCs and
increases with progression to castration resistance and metastatic disease. Tumor vascularity has a major
impact on tumor growth and drug responsiveness with respect to tumor oxygenation and permeability of
chemotherapeutics. PC cell-vascular endothelial cell (EC) crosstalk induces expression of PSMA on the surface
of tumor vasculature in PC and in renal cell carcinoma and breast, lung, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, and
bladder cancers
. Consequently, PSMA-targeted therapies (radiotherapeutics as well as small-molecule and
antibody drug-conjugates) are actively being pursued and are anticipated to modulate PC tumor vasculature and
diseases involving pathological angiogenesis.
 Our long-term goal is to develop a flexible 3D bioprinted tumor microenvironment model that can serve as
a preclinical screening platform to enhance the development of novel therapeutic agents for various cancers.
This study aims to develop a well-defined in vitro model that mimics the molecular, cellular, and metabolic
interplay in the bone-tumor microenvironment of metastatic PC and confirm that it is similarly responsive as the
clinical condition is to novel targeted diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The rationale for undertaking the
proposed research is that developing a reproducible predictive PC tumor-bone model will accelerate therapeutic
development for PC and minimize clinical failures."

Despite fewer deaths as a result of the Safe Sleep campaign, the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains
the leading cause of post-neonatal infant mortality in the United States (~0.39/1000 live births). Our research
strongly implicates biological abnormalities within the brainstem that underlie an infant's vulnerability to SIDS,
including abnormalities in the serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter systems. MicroRNA (miRNA) biology has
emerged rapidly with clear evidence that miRNAs play a critical role in regulation of protein expression, including
in the regulation of proteins involved in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS) and
in the regulation of the 5-HTergic system within the CNS. We recently performed an unbiased sequencing screen
of microRNAs in a dissected area of the medulla concentrated with 5-HT neurons to identify differentially
expressed miRNAs in SIDS compared to controls. In this proposal we focus on two of the miRNAs identified
with altered expression – miR-34a-5p (upregulated in SIDS) and miR-122-5p (downregulated in SIDS) and two
mRNAs that these miRNAs target, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated 3 (HCN3) and cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1), respectively. These specific miRNAs were selected based
on the reported roles that HCN channels and CPEB1 play in 5-HT function and inflammation, respectively, the
latter of interest given evidence of an effect of inflammation on 5-HT metabolism. Here we test the following
hypotheses, directly in SIDS tissue and serum that: 1) cell-specific dysregulation of miR-34a-5p and miR-122-
5p in the medulla of SIDS, results in aberrant expression of their respective mRNA targets, HCN3 and CPEB1
(Specific Aims 1 and 2) and, 2) that aberrant levels of medullary miR-34a-5p and miR-122-5p are reflected within
the serum of SIDS infants and serve as potential biomarkers of SIDS pathogenesis (Specific Aim 3). We will
use our unique database of SIDS and non-SIDS controls, multiplexed in-situ hybridization techniques, machine
learning quantitative software, and qPCR directly in human SIDS and control tissue and serum. Data generated
from this R21 will be utilized to further develop novel hypotheses and animal models aimed at this important
regulatory system."
10951799,"Abstract: The hallmarks of chronic kidney disease (CKD) include fibrosis, increased inflammatory
responses, and dysregulated mineral metabolism, which are all especially problematic in aged patients and
strongly associated with morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the fibrotic lesions arising in humans as well as CKD
rodent models cause dramatic decreases in renal function, leading to further cycles of inflammation and
activation of myofibroblasts with collagen accumulation. The bone-produced hormone fibroblast growth factor-
23 (FGF23) controls phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, and is markedly increased in late-stage CKD
(>1000-fold), in part due to loss of its co-receptor, Klotho (KL). The dysregulation of FGF23 results in severe
endocrine bone disease in aged patients whose musculoskeletal system is already compromised, and it is
not known whether this pathologic phenotype can be ameliorated with improvement of kidney function. There
are no direct therapies for CKD fibrosis, and it remains unclear whether targeting fibrosis using broad
spectrum drugs is feasible in clinical practice because most drugs that decrease fibrosis in pre-clinical models
target multiple essential pathogenic pathways (eg, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade).
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a transmembrane serine protease expressed by activated fibroblasts in
wound healing and pathological conditions such as fibrosis and cancer. Our collaborator, Dr. Jonathan
Epstein, developed a transient anti-FAP Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell mRNA therapy (or
‘FAPCAR’) which reduced cardiac fibrosis following infarction. FAP is an optimal target for CAR-T cell
targeting as it is a cell surface molecule only expressed during pathology and not at high levels under normal
conditions. To treat fibrosis, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) designed to target CD5-positive T cells are
endocytosed, and the mRNA encoding FAPCAR translated within the cell. The advantage of this approach is
that the generated in vivo fibrosis-targeted CAR-T cells do not require individualized patient derived cells, and
there is no danger of random T-cell gene interruption as in standard CAR-T therapy. Our central hypothesis
is: CD5/LNP-FAPCAR pre-clinical therapy will directly target renal fibrosis and improve renal function and
mineral metabolism either alone or in combination treatment in aged mice with CKD. Considering the
magnitude of the negative effects of fibrosis on CKD outcomes in the aging population, and the fact there are
no FDA-approved therapies directly resolving fibrosis, our studies are important for the CKD field. Thus we
will address our hypothesis under Specific Aims: 1. To test preclinical CD5/LNP-FAPCAR therapy in
prevention and treatment of CKD fibrosis in aged and adult mice; and 2.To test FAP-expressing fibroblast
ablation as a combination therapy. Thus, our proposed studies are innovative as we will test for the first time
whether a novel transient LNP-FAPCAR therapy can be used to reduce CKD fibrosis in the aged, and whether
this treatment improves mineral metabolism, a key pathology that also has no adequate treatments."
10952065,"Clinical Problem: Up to 48.5% of adolescent and young adult (AYA, 15 – 39 years old) cancer survivors
experience clinically relevant anxiety. Anxiety disrupts the successful achievement of normative developmental
tasks and is associated with fear of cancer recurrence and decreased quality of life. Cognitive behavioral
therapy is a guideline-based recommendation for anxiety, but only 40% of AYAs seek out such treatments, and
stigma regarding psychotherapy is high, particularly among individuals of diverse backgrounds.
Overall Objective: Music-based interventions offer an evidence-based treatment for anxiety in adults with
cancer. Despite the growth of studies, approximately 8% of trials have included AYA/pediatric cancer patients.
The overall objective is to determine the feasibility of conducting an eight-week, (45 min/week), virtually-
delivered, tailored music-based relaxation (TiMBRe) intervention to decrease anxiety in AYA cancer survivors.
TiMBRe uses tailored music experiences, delivered by a board-certified music therapist, to develop greater
self-awareness and use of music-based relaxation to increase self-efficacy to cope and manage anxiety.
Need for Planning Study: The primary aim of our future, phase II, multicenter randomized controlled trial is to
determine the efficacy of a virtual, TiMBRe intervention to reduce anxiety in AYA cancer survivors with
clinically relevant anxiety. Our preliminary data (N=37) demonstrate that the implementation of a four-session
(45 min each), virtual TiMBRe intervention for AYAs with cancer is feasible and well accepted by AYAs, with a
majority (13/21, [67%]) of AYAs with anxiety reporting clinically significant changes in their anxiety pre-to post-
intervention. However, we must first address several planning issues that will prepare the protocol for
successful implementation and completion in a randomized controlled trial.
R34 Specific Aims: The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled
trial of an eight-week, virtual, TiMBRe intervention in post-treatment AYA cancer survivors with clinically
relevant anxiety. Secondarily, we will determine the credibility of an attention control condition for virtual
TiMBRe and develop fidelity measures to ensure standardized delivery of virtual TiMBRe across therapists.
Methods: Using an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design, we will first randomize 50 AYA cancer
survivors with clinically relevant anxiety from the University of Michigan to the eight-week TiMBRe intervention
or attention-control (i.e., study staff calls + cancer survivorship resources). Participants will complete patient-
reported outcome measures (e.g., PROMIS Anxiety 4a) at baseline, four, eight, and twenty weeks. TiMBRe
group participants will participate in semi-structured interviews to evaluate intervention acceptability.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome is the demonstration that virtual TiMBRe intervention delivery is
feasible within a randomized-controlled trial, with further data supporting a credible attention control and
effective intervention fidelity methods. Results will inform a phase II efficacy trial."

B and T lymphocytes form the foundation of our adaptive immune system, which is based on specific
recognition of foreign molecules by structurally diverse surface antigen receptors. Structural diversity in these
receptors originates from RAG (recombination activating gene)-mediated V(D)J recombination that assembles
antigen receptor genes during lymphocyte development. However, V(D)J recombination is not always benign,
as aberrant rearrangement can contribute to genomic instability and cancer in lymphocytes. We previously
showed that the amino-terminal 215 residues of RAG1, which is dispensable for RAG endonuclease activity,
constrains V(D)J recombination by recruiting Vpr Binding Protein (VprBP) and its associated Cullin4-DDB1-
Rbx1 (CRL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to mediate timely RAG1 degradation. Interestingly, VprBP (also
called DCAF1) was recently found to stabilize the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase Enhancer of zeste
homolog 2 (Ezh2), which catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) by the
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) is generally considered to
promote gene silencing. In mice, B lineage-specific loss of Ezh2 expression arrests B cell development at the
pro-B to pre-B cell transition, and selectively impairs rearrangement of the distal immunoglobulin (Ig) VHJ558
gene family. This phenotype resembles that observed in mice lacking VprBP in B cells. Truncating the first
215 residues of RAG1 in mice to eliminate the VprBP binding site (R1215 mice) confers a less severe
phenotype, but nevertheless impairs short-range Ig D-J rearrangement for reasons that remain unclear. These
observations lead us to hypothesize that VprBP stabilizes Ezh2 in B cells to promote PRC2 formation, H3K27
methylation, transcriptional programs, and immune repertoire in early B lineage cells, and through VprBPs
association with full-length RAG1, specifically regulates H3K27 methylation within the Igh locus to regulate
short-range Ig D-J rearrangement. This hypothesis will be tested by experiments described in two broad Aims.
In Aim I of this project, we will: (a) establish the concordance of the phenotypes presented by mice lacking
VprBP or Ezh2 in the B lineage when rescued by enforced Bcl2 expression; (b) compare Ezh2, total H3, and
H3K27me3 protein levels in wild-type and VprBP-deficient B cells, using Ezh2-deficient B cells as a negative
control; and (c) establish VprBP-dependent Ezh2 association with PRC2 subunits EED and SUZ12 in primary
B cells. In Aim II of this project, we will use RNA, immune repertoire, and H3K27me3 “Cut&Run” sequencing
approaches to analyze and compare the transcriptome, Ig gene usage, and localization of H3K27me3 marks in
sorted pro-B and pre-B cells from wild-type, VprBP-deficient, Ezh2-deficient, and R1215-expressing B cells.
Establishing that the RAG1-VprBP-Ezh2-H3K27me3 axis regulates V(D)J recombination would be
conceptually innovative, as it provides a means for the RAGs to locally modify Ig gene accessibility and
expression within antigen receptor loci by recruiting VprBP and regulating Ezh2 activity."
10952842,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Role of JMJD4 in Pancreatic Cancer
 In 2023, nearly 50,000 patients will die from pancreatic cancer in the US. This malignancy has one of
the worst survival rates, indicating the urgent need for better therapies. A more comprehensive
understanding of driving forces in pancreatic cancer may furnish novel ideas how to curtail this disease.
 JMJD4 is an enzyme that has been implicated in protein lysine hydroxylation and demethylation.
However, the precise physiological functions of JMJD4 and its mechanisms of action have remained
unresolved. Our preliminary data demonstrate that JMJD4 is upregulated in pancreatic tumors and JMJD4
ablation reduces growth and clonogenicity of human pancreatic cancer cells, while JMJD4 overexpression
may stimulate cell invasion. Further, we provide evidence that JMJD4 interacts with two transcription
factors involved in the development of tumors and chemoresistance: the stress response mediator NRF2
and HIF-2a, a major component of the hypoxia response pathway. This suggests various potential
mechanisms by which JMJD4 could affect pancreatic cancer cells.
 Based on these and other preliminary data, we posit that JMJD4 promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis.
Moreover, we hypothesize that JMJD4 functions, at least in part, through modulating NRF2 and HIF-2a.
To test these hypotheses, we propose two specific aims: (i) To determine the role of JMJD4 in pancreatic
cancer cells. (ii) To reveal how JMJD4 acts at the molecular level.
 Completion of these studies will greatly advance our mechanistic understanding of JMJD4 and its role
in pancreatic tumors. Furthermore, our research may nominate the JMJD4 enzyme as a novel target for
the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Because JMJD4 is not essential in normal cells, small molecule
inhibitors of JMJD4 are predicted to have minimal side effects, a highly desirable feature. Lastly, insights
gained here likely have implications for the treatment of other diseases, including colorectal and lung
cancer, where JMJD4 is also overexpressed."
10951972,"Transcriptional profiling of proliferative skeletal muscle mononucleated cells coupled with broadband
electrical cytometry towards diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating, acquired disease affecting up
to 2.5 million Americans. With increasing evidence that a proportion of patients with COVID-19 experience
prolonged convalescence and chronic symptoms similar to ME/CFS, it is suggested that the incidence of
ME/CFS will increase significantly. Currently, no single biomarkers or pathognomonic signs have been identified
for diagnostic measures. Instead, diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms after exclusion of other possible
etiologies known to cause fatigue, a method that does not prescribe adequate sensitivity or specificity. Since
clinical symptoms suggest that skeletal muscle is a major and consistent target of the pathology, and proliferative
skeletal mononucleated cells (SMMCs) are excellent indicators of muscle disorders, we hypothesize that
proliferative SMMCs from of ME/CFS patients are distinguishable from those of healthy individuals on the
molecular and cellular level. Proposed work will investigate gene expression, functional pathways and electrical
characteristics of single SMMCs from ME/CFS and healthy donors to identify a matrix of molecular and
biophysical markers to enable future development of diagnostics. Single-cell mRNA profiling will identify
differential gene expression describing alterations that occur in ME/CFS samples. Using differential biomarkers
identified by scRNA-seq, subpopulations of SMMCs unique to ME/CFS will be sorted to study changes in protein
expression and cell function. Furthermore, an impedance cytometer recently developed by our team will be used
to measure single cell electrical spectra, and disease-specific signatures will be identified by machine learning.
The molecular, cellular and electrical characteristics will be further correlated with each other to provide a
comprehensive understanding of the SMMC pathology in ME/CFS, an untapped subject. The proposed single-
cell transcriptome analysis of SMMCs from ME/CFS patients represents the first study of its kind and will greatly
contribute to the fundamental knowledge of the role of proliferative SMMCs in ME/CFS dysfunctions. Compared
to molecular approaches, proposed impedance cytometry captures a ‘big picture’ of the multitude of changes
contributing to abnormalities in ME/CFS SMMCs. As specific molecular markers have not been identified for
diagnostic measures, the holistic electrical characteristics of single cells offer a unique perspective of global
changes in SMMCs and hold great diagnostic potential in the future. Integration of electrical and biological studies
of SMMCs will further allow interpretation of the impedance spectra to promote sensing specificity."
10973271,"Abstract.
Reducing stigma to ensure viral load (VL) suppression for women with serious mental illness (SMI) and HIV is a
global priority, including in Botswana, where the intersectional stigma of SMI, HIV and womanhood is
marginalizing in ways that impede adherence to both psychiatric medications and antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which can threaten VL suppression. We apply our novel ‘what matters most’ (WMM) approach to target
intersectional stigma faced by women with SMI and HIV in Botswana via a stigma-reduction intervention in the
high-risk transition period after discharge from an initial psychiatric hospitalization. WMM conceptualizes how
stigma is felt most acutely when people are unable to achieve ‘full personhood’ by participating in the activities
that ‘matter most’ in their local context. In prior research, we found the core value for ‘full womanhood’ in
Botswana is achieved by being the ‘foundation of the household’ and is threatened by perceived: 1)
incompetence in fulfilling the duties of a family caregiver associated with SMI and 2) promiscuity associated with
having HIV. In Botswana, family acceptance as a viable ‘family caregiver’ is also key to achieving ‘full status’ as
a woman. As such, the risks of being identified as having SMI and HIV (e.g., partner/family abandonment) can
deter psychiatric and ART treatment adherence. Promoting capabilities that ‘matter most’ for achieving ‘full
womanhood’ could enable longer-term stigma reduction after psychiatric discharge, when women are
reintegrating into their communities, and improve ART adherence and promote sustained VL suppression. Our
group-based WMM stigma intervention is co-led by a peer woman who has coped effectively with SMI and HIV
stigma. The WMM stigma intervention model was piloted among pregnant women with HIV in Botswana with
promising reductions in stigma and depressive symptoms up to 4-months postpartum. We now test whether a
WMM intervention tailored for women with SMI and HIV will reduce intersectional stigma and facilitate VL
suppression. We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=180) with a 4-month follow-up to
compare the effectiveness of 1) WMM-based intersectional stigma intervention delivered as clients transition
from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care (‘WMM Stigma Intervention;’ n=90); and 2) attention control
following a similar format to isolate the effects of the intervention (n=90). Because family are commonly involved
in the care of people with SMI and face severe stigma, we propose a parallel, group stigma intervention among
family members, as addressing familial stigma could facilitate treatment adherence. Finally, because
intersectional stigma is reinforced at systemic levels, we seek to empower women with SMI and HIV to influence
structural change by coleading policymaker workshops to reduce stigma among policymakers and spur
policymakers to address the unique needs of women with SMI and HIV via future policies."
10875504,"PROJECT SUMMARY Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease resulting in the progressive loss of limb, trunk, and head and neck (bulbar) motor function and is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. The disease is characterized by significant across-patient heterogeneity in the onset region and in pattern and progression rate, making early and accurate diagnosis difficult. Most individuals with ALS will eventually acquire bulbar symptoms, including a loss of speech and swallowing. The social and psychological impact of communication loss on the quality of life of patients with ALS is significant and a diagnostic tool to detect these changes early, accurately, and easily remains unmet. Moreover, improved speech testing tools are critically needed in ALS to (1) improve diagnostic testing and monitoring, and (2) expediting clinical trials of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Although speech testing is a core component of many neurological assessment batteries, few commercial digital speech monitoring tools have been developed or scientifically validated, especially for ALS. This project aims to develop and scientifically validate a digital speech assessment tool – the Modality Digital Speech Monitoring Tool (M- DSMT) - for monitoring speech decline due to ALS. The M-DSMT is fully automated, online, objective, scalable, accessible, and is used in real-time. The tool is operating-system and device-agnostic, running on commercially available laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Therefore, if demonstrated to be effective, the proposed tool can be rapidly commercialized and deployed into standard care and clinical trials for ALS. Our specific aims are to (1) optimize the quality and yield of remote audio and video recordings for automated measurement, (2) determine the analytical validity of the M-DSMT, (3) determine the clinical validity of the M-DSMT, and (4) determine the usability of the M-DSMT. This project's objectives are to improve diagnosis for patients with ALS, decrease costs of speech assessment, and allow patients who have difficulty traveling to continue to have access to regular speech assessments. Ultimately, we aim to improve the quality of care in persons with ALS and facilitate ongoing efforts to discover a cure for this fatal disease through the development of this innovative technology."
10945549,"Title: Pathophysiological mechanisms in the brain’s endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 system mediated by
obesogenic diets
Pharmacotherapies that target the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) system are commonly prescribed
for the treatment of type II diabetes and, more recently, for weight loss. Although successful at reducing appetite
and bodyweight, there are several limitations of GLP-1R agonists that limit their widespread use. Moreover, the
role of the endogenous GLP-1 and GLP-1R system, particularly in the brain, and its role in obesity pathogenesis
is unclear. In this application, our multidisciplinary team will address this primary gap in knowledge by dissecting
the function and activity states of GLP-1-producing neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and their
outputs to GLP-1R-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in a model of
diet-induced obesity. In Aim 1, we will use convergent electrophysiological, anatomical, and optical methods to
measure the wiring and activity states of GcgNTS neurons, the primary source of GLP-1 in the brain, after
exposure to obesogenic high fat diet. Further, we will use custom tools and novel transgenic mice to dissect
neurotransmission between GcgNTS neurons and one of their primary outputs in the PVH, Glp1rPVH neurons, ex
vivo and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine the causal role of GcgNTS neurons and outputs to the PVH in
progressive and interventional models of diet-induced obesity using intersectional viral tools. These exciting
experiments will yield important insight into the pathophysiological role of the brain’s endogenous GLP-1/GLP-
1R system and establish if targeting GcgNTS neurons is a therapeutically tractable strategy for new obesity
treatments."
10944747,"PROJECT SUMMARY Implantable medical devices are on the rise, both in the US and worldwide. Over 12
million Americans rely on a cardiac or neuromodulation device, and this number increases by 100,000 every
year. Roughly 75% of these patients will require an MRI at some point, many multiple times. Yet, the
radiofrequency (RF) fields of MRI can interact harmfully with these devices, causing thermal injuries. This
restricts MRI access for most. The rise of low-field MRI scanners, operating at 0.55 T and below, offers
promise due to reduced costs and siting advantages. However, there's an alarming lack of data on their RF
safety. This absence of knowledge is not merely academic; it bears direct, tangible consequences. Our
preliminary findings paint a complex picture: some implants in these low-field scanners experience
substantially greater RF heating compared to a 1.5T MRI, while others are markedly safer. This disparity
signifies not only heightened risks of injury for some patients but also squandered chances for others who
might safely access essential imaging. With the FDA's recent endorsement of these scanners, there's an
urgent need to generate thorough, evidence-based knowledge about their RF safety, ensuring we fully harness
their benefits without jeopardizing patient welfare. In direct response to this need, we propose a to leverage our
expertise in MRI computational modeling and safety assessment and our access to state-of-the-art deep brain
stimulation (DBS) and cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to perform a rigorous and
unbiased evaluation of RF heating of DBS and cardiac devices during MRI at 0.55 T. Our team, with ten years
of experience in MRI safety, is ideally suited to address this urgent requirement swiftly. Over the last three
years, we've forged critical alliances with leading implant manufacturers and gained unique access to the
designs of the latest low-field systems. This combination of expertise and privileged access allows us to
achieve results faster than traditional timelines. In this 3-year R01 project, we will conduct a thorough
assessment of RF heating effects for deep brain stimulation (DBS) and cardiac implantable devices during
0.55 T MRI scans. Combined, these devices represent 80% of the active implant market. Our approach will
utilize, validate, and implement RF heating test methods from ISO TS 10974—a robust testing procedure
honed globally for two decades and now required by the FDA for MR-conditional labeling. Specifically, our
objectives are: To create and validate models that consistently forecast RF exposure levels during 0.55 T MRI
(Aim 1). To employ these confirmed models to ascertain RF heating of DBS and CIEDs in both adult and
pediatric subjects (Aim 2). To formulate tables that anticipate age and device-specific temperature increases in
tissue based on imaging landmarks and pulse sequence metrics (Aim 3)."
10944790,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer and is responsible for 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Blacks are 15% less
likely to be diagnosed early, 10% more likely to not receive any treatment, and 12% less likely to survive 5
years compared to Whites. Overwhelmingly, there is enough proof that cancer treatments such as platinum-
based chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy drugs, hormone treatment, anti-inflammatory drugs, combination
treatment, and anti-cancer agents, are effective in prolonging survival. In addition, delays, early termination of
treatments and early termination of treatment cycles occur among the elderly and increase mortality.
Furthermore, there may be important causal factors in relation to patient and provider characteristics that may
influence treatment success. However, we do not know how well it generalizes in terms of risks for survival to
Black non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, a population with higher rates of lung cancer-specific and
all-cause mortality compared to Whites. Our long-term goal is to study the disparities in inequitable cancer
treatments and survival by educating clinicians. Our short-term goal is to document and communicate racial
inequities discovered to clinicians. Our main objective is to determine whether Black NSCLC patients are
receiving comparable cancer treatment to White NSCLC patients that can lengthen their survival. Our central
hypothesis is that there are racial disparities in receiving cancer treatment and treatment combinations, such
as chemotherapy plus immunotherapy that may improve survival. We will use the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network oncologic guidelines for NSCLC to determine standard treatment. To address our specific
aims, we will use a retrospective cohort study design and analyze our data using logistic and survival mixed
models. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine racial disparities for receipt of cancer treatments, time to
receiving first single cancer treatment/treatment combinations, number of cycles and dose given in NSCLC; 2)
Determine the impact of time on lung-specific survival and overall survival; and 3) Investigate the bidirectional
intersectionality of causal factors in receiving treatment, delays in receiving first treatment, number of cycles,
and dose that impact racial disparities by stage, including patient characteristics (toxicities from cancer
treatments, histology, symptom burden, comorbidities, age, sex, insurance, SES levels, urban/rural area) and
provider characteristics (type of facility, hospital ownership, teaching status, location, and number of hospital
beds). Future studies will be aimed at investigating these Specific Aims in other minority groups, other types of
cancers for which Blacks have decreased survival, and translating the qualitative aspects of treatment
management in NSCLC patients."
10945172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last few decades, the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy has led to a profound suppression of
HIV replication and dramatically increased life expectancy in people with HIV (PWH). As a consequence, the
spectrum of diseases related to HIV has shifted from opportunistic AIDS-related disorders towards a premature
aging phenotype including an early onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is now the leading cause of
death in PWH, however, the etiopathology of the accelerated development of hypertension, the leading risk
factor for CVD, has yet to be determined. Herein, we will test whether HIV derived proteins, which remain in
circulation despite cART and well-controlled viremia, contribute to the development of hypertension. We provide
novel exciting preliminary data in the Tg26 mouse model of HIV supporting a role for T cell-derived HIV proteins
and inflammation in vascular dysfunction, sympatho-activation, and hypertension. We demonstrate that
expression of HIV-derived proteins in Tg26 mice increases circulating Interleukin-1α (IL-1α), impairs
endothelium-dependent relaxation, increases sympathetic activity, and induces hypertension in male and female
mice. Remarkably, we show that transplant of bone marrow from Tg26 to wild-type (WT) mice recapitulates the
cardiovascular phenotype of intact Tg26 mice. Moreover, inhibition of T lymphocytes (T cells) activation restores
blood pressure (BP) and sympatho-activation and improves endothelial function in Tg26 mice. Conversely,
exposure of WT aortic rings to Tg26 T cells in a novel “T cells-vessel” co-culture system impairs endothelial
function and incubation with an anti-IL-1α antibody abrogates Tg26 T cell-mediated endothelial dysfunction. We
also show that endothelial dysfunction involves increased expression of the NADPH oxidase homologue Nox1
and that deficiency in Nox1 protects against Tg26-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. Strikingly,
we provide very preliminary evidence of higher IL-1α transcriptional levels in CD4+ T cells from PWH and show
that aorta specimens discarded from PWH exhibit higher Nox1 expression than that from HIV- individuals. In
addition, exposure of human aorta specimen to Tg26 T cells media elevates Nox1 expression. Finally, we report
that infusion of the viral protein Tat in mice impairs endothelial function via Nox1-dependent mechanism.
Together, these exciting and novel findings inform the core hypothesis of this proposal: HIV Tat protein derived
from CD4+ T cells induces hypertension via IL-1α and Nox1 dependent mechanisms. We will test this hypothesis
in three aims. In aim 1, we will test whether HIV-associated hypertension involves CD4+ T cell-mediated, IL-1α-induced endothelial dysfunction and sympatho-activation. In aim 2 we will investigate whether IL-1α accelerates
vascular aging and promotes hypertension through Nox1 and senescence-mediated endothelial dysfunction,
while aim 3 will test the hypothesis that HIV-derived Tat protein promotes IL-1α-production from T cells and
hypertension. We anticipate that this proposal will lead to the identification of the new therapeutic targets to
prevent the accelerated development of CVD exhibited by people with HIV."
10947362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYACSs) face multiple disparities, including impaired
psychosocial health, isolation, limited access to psychological services, and unmet needs for psychosocial
support. Despite these disparities, there is a lack of interventions to mitigate these disparities and improve the
quality of life (QOL) of AYACSs. Furthermore, previous studies among AYACSs have often overlooked their
diverse developmental stages and preferences concerning psychosocial care. While expressive writing
interventions have demonstrated positive effects on various health outcomes among older adult cancer
survivors and healthy young adults, they have primarily been implemented as individual-based approaches.
One innovative idea to adapt such interventions for AYACSs is to combine individual-based writing with social
support from a group of peers experiencing similar challenges. Thus, this proposed study aims to develop and
evaluate a virtual, group-based expressive writing intervention, grounded in a conceptual framework tailored to
the unique developmental needs of AYACSs and incorporating their communication preferences. The
overarching goal is to enhance the QOL and reduce stress of AYACSs. Aim 1(K99) is to develop a virtual,
group-based expressive writing intervention and assess the feasibility and acceptability. To promote group
cohesion, group composition preferences (i.e., age-similar or general groups) will be assessed before the
intervention. Aim 2 (K99) is to refine and optimize the intervention based on quantitative and qualitative data
obtained from Aim 1, in collaboration with stakeholders such as the MD Anderson Young Adult Advisory
Council, AYA clinic providers, and AYA organizations, as well as the PI’s mentorship team. Finally, Aim 3
(R00) is to assess the effects of the intervention on QOL, perceived stress, and stress biomarkers compared to
a control group. If successful, this intervention will be ready for widespread expansion, including to
underserved communities with limited resources and support. The PI’s long-term career and research goal is
to become an independent oncology nurse scientist in the areas of cancer prevention and control, developing
and evaluating novel psychosocial interventions to improve QOL and eliminate health disparities among
AYACSs. To achieve this goal, the PI seeks specialized training in various areas, such as psychosocial and
behavioral interventions, understanding the diverse developmental needs of AYACSs, proficiency in
quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods research, and stress biomarkers, and professional development. The
proposed training areas will be obtained through hands-on training with mentors, taking formal courses, and
active participation in conferences and institutional trainings. In summary, the proposed research plan and
training will enable the PI to transition to independence by providing the necessary skills and preliminary data
to successfully compete for future R01-level grants."
10949103,"Project Summary
Breast cancer is responsible for the deaths of more than 600,000 women each year. Thus, there is an over-
riding need to better understand the mechanisms that promote breast cancer, as this information can potentially
lead to new strategies to treat the disease. Recently, the Cerione lab discovered a mechanism through which
highly aggressive forms of breast cancer cells produce a secretome containing factors that promote cancer cell
survival and metastatic spread. Specifically, the researchers showed that the decreased expression of the NAD+-
dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) increases the formation and release of exosomes, a specific class of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are derived from multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) within the endocytic/lysosomal
trafficking pathway. This effect was due to the increased acetylation of the RNA binding protein, IGF2BP2, that
binds to the 3' untranslated region of the transcript encoding ATP6V1A, a major catalytic subunit of the vacuolar
ATPase (v-ATPase) that maintains the proper pH and activity of lysosomes. Acetylated IGF2BP2 recruits an
exonuclease, XRN2, which degrades the ATP6V1A transcript, resulting in impaired lysosomal activity. Thus,
MVBs that would otherwise be targeted and degraded in lysosomes are instead directed to the cell surface where
they fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents, i.e., exosomes enriched in unique cargo and
soluble hydrolases, into the extracellular space. These components of the secretome were shown to work
together to strongly promote the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Whether there were additional transcripts
that were regulated similarly to the ATP6V1A transcripts by SIRT1 and IGF2BP2 were then determined. Based
on a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis performed, fourteen transcripts were identified; four of which
encode proteins that potentially play important roles in breast cancer progression and/or exosome biogenesis.
For the F99 phase of this application, I plan to establish that the stability of these transcripts is indeed regulated
by SIRT1 and IGF2BP2, and to investigate how changes in their levels impact breast cancer progression (Aim
1). In addition to the tumor suppressor role played by SIRT1 in breast cancer, reductions in its expression have
also been heavily implicated in aging, a major risk factor for developing cancer, as well as other diseases. In the
K00 phase of this proposal, I would like to investigate the interplay between aging and cancer. It has been
recently shown that the accumulation of aged/senescent cells results in the production of a secretome that can
increase the growth of cancer cells. My plan as a Post-doctoral trainee will be to determine whether the EVs
from aged/senescent cells contribute to this effect. Furthermore, I am also interested in exploring whether the
EVs secreted from cancer cells enable cells to evade undergoing senescence (Aim 2). Ultimately, the goal of
this study is to understand the relationship between aging and cancer to help identify potential therapeutic
treatment for patients."
10952923,"Project Summary
The mammalian cochlea is endowed with a robust efferent innervation called the olivocochlear system, that
begins in the ventral brainstem as two distinct neuronal clusters containing hundreds of cells. Axons from medial
olivocochlear (MOC) and lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons travel out cranial nerve VIII where they profusely
collateralize in the cochlea to end as thousands of synaptic terminals on outer hair cells (OHC) and primary
auditory afferents innervating inner hair cells, respectively. By nature of their connectivity, MOC and LOC
neurons are strategically poised to modulate how the cochlea functions at some of the earliest stages of detecting
and encoding sound. As reflected in a number of audiometric measures, activation of MOC neurons can give
rise to both a suppression and an enhancement of cochlear function by modulating the OHC’s contributions to
sound amplification. The release of acetylcholine (ACh) and the activation of nicotinic ACh receptors on OHCs
accounts for the MOC-mediated suppression in multiple mammalian species, but the synaptic mechanisms
underlying MOC-mediated enhancement have not been identified. This is further complicated by observations
that indicate MOC neurons may express a dozen or more different neurotransmitters beyond ACh. As a result,
there is a clear gap in our knowledge regarding how one critical signaling arm of the MOC system operates. To
facilitate a more complete understanding of MOC function in mammalian auditory physiology, two specific aims
will be pursued in the peripheral auditory system of mice. The first specific aim will isolate the MOC-mediated
enhancement phenomenon after pharmacological blockade and genetic ablation of MOC-mediated suppression.
This will allow for a systematic evaluation of MOC-mediated enhancement over a range of varying auditory and
MOC stimulation conditions. The second specific aim will specify and characterize the MOC transmitter and
postsynaptic mechanisms required for MOC-mediated enhancement. To complete these specific aims, we will
leverage recordings of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in the anesthetized mouse before,
during, and after electrical stimulation of MOC neurons in the brainstem. Selective pharmacological agents will
be administered directly to the perilymphatic compartment to isolate MOC-mediated enhancement as well as
identify its underlying signaling components. Immunohistochemical studies will be performed in several strains
of mice to localize receptor proteins, integral to the synaptic mechanisms implicated by our pharmacological
observations. These studies are significant as they will provide much needed insights into the diverse synaptic
mechanisms that the MOC neurons recruit to modulate auditory function in mammals. The data captured by this
proposal is critical for probing the functional roles of the MOC system in auditory physiology as well as identifying
novel synaptic processes that can be targeted pharmacologically for combating hearing dysfunction."
10952840,"Low-income, racial/ethnic minoritized individuals, especially people of color living in impoverished communities,
have limited access to evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for mental health yet also experience greater psy-
chiatric and medical comorbidities and poorer treatment outcomes compared to higher-income, White counter-
parts. Alarmingly, rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorder (SUD) have risen sig-
nificantly for Black adults over the past two decades, particularly individuals living in poverty, resulting in dispro-
portionately worsening clinical and functional outcomes. There is a pressing need to disseminate EBIs for MDD-
SUD that are acceptable, scalable and sustainable in traditionally underserved settings, including Certified Com-
munity Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) which seek to expand access to services in socioeconomically dis-
advantaged areas. Peer recovery specialists (PRSs), individuals in recovery from SUD, have promise for in-
creasing access to EBIs and are widely employed in CCBHCs; yet, few studies have evaluated the clinical ef-
fectiveness, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of PRS-delivered EBIs, even as PRS models are rapidly
scaling in the US. Preliminary data: PIs Felton and Magidson have led two open-label trials demonstrating the
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a PRS-delivered model (Peer Activate) to improve MDD
and SUD outcomes among low-income, predominantly Black individuals in traditionally underserved areas. The
team has shown that behavioral activation (BA), an EBI based on reinforcement theory and focused on sched-
uling of valued, adaptive behaviors is particularly suitable for PRS delivery and promising to address gaps in EBI
access. Preliminary studies established the feasibility and acceptability of this approach; next steps are to con-
duct a large-scale randomized trial to evaluate clinical and cost effectiveness, test potential modifiable mecha-
nisms of treatment effectiveness, and evaluate longer-term implementation. Methods: We propose to evaluate
Peer Activate in a fully-powered randomized hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial (n=200) in a his-
torically underserved setting in Detroit, MI. Leveraging a well-established partnership with a community-based,
PRS-led CCBHC, we will compare Peer Activate to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU; non-specific, PRS-
delivered supportive care) on depressive symptoms (primary) and substance use (Aim 1), and evaluate potential
mechanisms of this approach (environmental reward; Aim 2). Guided by the EPIS framework and Proctor’s
model, we will evaluate longer-term implementation outcomes (Aim 3), including cost effectiveness. A community
advisory board will guide all aspects of the trial to promote the potential for sustainability. Impact: Our proposal
is consistent with the goals of PAR-21-130, NIMH strategic objectives to develop innovative service delivery
models for low-income, Black individuals with mental health and SUD comorbidity, and NOT-MH-22-170 promo-
tion of partnerships between academic institutions and CCBHCs. Findings have the potential to increase avail-
ability of sustainable EBIs for mental health and SUD comorbidity in underserved communities."
10940082,"ABSTRACT
Mitochondria are essential organelles that serve as the cellular hub for metabolism, ATP production, and redox
signaling. We identified a novel mechanism of signaling in the mitochondria mediated by a post translational
modification known as AMPylation, the covalent addition of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to protein
substrates. Our previous studies revealed that Selenoprotein O catalyzes AMPylation of multiple mitochondrial
proteins involved in redox homeostasis and cellular metabolism. There are several critical gaps in our current
knowledge of AMPylation including the functional importance of AMPylation, as well as the enzymes that reverse
AMPylation. To gain a mechanistic understanding of AMPylation, we developed an enrichment strategy for
AMPylated proteins and identified RNase Z as a deAMPylase that catalyzes the removal of AMP from AMPylated
substrates. RNase Z was previously shown to be a conserved endoribonuclease that cleaves the 3’ trailer of
precursor tRNAs to generate mature tRNAs.
Our studies establish RNase Z as a multifunctional protein with previously unrecognized functional roles beyond
tRNA processing. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to determine the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of
RNase Z-mediated deAMPylation. Mutations in RNase Z result in severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
increased prostate cancer susceptibility. We hypothesize that the deAMPylation activity, in addition to the
endoribonuclease activity, contributes to the functional importance of RNase Z in the mitochondria. However,
our understanding of mitochondrial AMPylation is in its infancy due to the lack of tools to study the AMPylated
proteins. Thus, we developed a novel enrichment strategy for the identification and functional characterization
of AMPylated proteins. We anticipate these studies will reveal previously undocumented roles for AMPylation in
cellular signaling and the molecular mechanisms of RNase Z-associated diseases."

 Levels of adolescent anxiety, depression, and suicidality have been steadily rising over the last decade
and have reached record levels in the wake of the COVID pandemic, prompting declarations of a national
emergency in youth mental health. These alarming trends are especially dramatic for youth living in poverty,
and low-income youth who are members of minoritized racial or ethnic groups and those living in isolated rural
areas, who experienced some of the most severe impacts from the pandemic. The COVID pandemic and its
mitigation efforts exacerbated these disparities by increasing potent stressors such as social isolation, loss,
and family disruptions. Mental health risks evident for diverse low-income adolescents are further compounded
by limited access to culturally affirming services made even scarcer in the pandemic. Waitlists at many youth-
serving clinics approach 12 months, and access to affordable services is even more limited. Equally important
is the dearth of interventions designed specifically to meet the needs of low-income adolescents that are
trauma-informed, and based on inclusive empowerment principles, contextual strength-based frameworks, and
firm empirical evidence. The Building a Strong Identity and Coping Skills (BaSICS) program is a trauma-
informed coping and empowerment intervention for early adolescents exposed to chronic stress that (1)
teaches individual and collaborative skills for coping with stress and trauma, (2) develops positive social
identity, and (3) culminates in group-based community action. By building supportive relationships with peers,
improving active engagement coping, fostering identity development, and empowering youth to action, BaSICS
gives adolescents tools with which to address the myriad stressors to which they are exposed.
 The proposed work aims to replicate and extend the findings from a smaller-scale trial of BaSICS
where, relative to control group, youth randomized to BaSICS acquired targeted coping and self-regulation
skills and demonstrated improved cortisol reactivity and reduced internalizing problems. The proposed study
will examine treatment effects on depression, anxiety and suicidality in clinically referred youth from four sites
across central Pennsylvania. The proposed project will also extend prior findings by integrating data across
multiple biological stress response systems to further evaluate the potential for BaSICS to re-calibrate
dysregulated stress physiology. Enrolling low-income youth from various racial and ethnic groups and from
urban and rural areas, the trial will enable examination of potential moderators of BaSICS that can inform
future dissemination efforts. The proposed study promises to further NIMH’s Strategic Framework on Youth
Mental Health Disparities by improving our understanding of interventions with potential to reduce mental
health disparities. Adding to our mental health arsenal a biologically potent, targeted intervention that
balances the need for fundamental self-regulation and coping skills with the need for a culturally affirmative
strength and resource building approach, could help move the needle on socioeconomic health disparities."

As the global burden of ischemic stroke (IS) continues to rise due to population demographic shifts, new
treatment approaches for stroke prevention are needed to address its public health burden. Survivors of a prior
IS and individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) are populations at highest risk for future stroke. Current medical
therapies, such as aspirin and lipid lowering treatments, have limited benefit for secondary stroke prevention.
While oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of IS in the setting of AF, the risk of major bleeding and
nonadherence to therapy limits its effectiveness. Multiplexed proteomic profiling technologies have enabled the
measurement of circulating proteins from large populations, and the integration of proteomics with genomic
methods, have the potential to identify proteins that are etiologic factors of IS risk, and therefore potential
targets for prevention. We propose to leverage previously collected plasma samples, genomic data, and
longitudinal electronic medical record data from participants in the Heart and Vascular Health (HVH) Study. By
measuring ~5,300 proteins in 659 IS cases and 972 AF cases using the Olink proteomics platform, we will
evaluate the relationship between individual protein levels with the risk of future IS from up to 25 years of
follow-up. For proteins significantly associated with IS risk, we will use genomic data from the study population
and external cohorts to conduct Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to evaluate for evidence
supporting potential causal relationships. Findings will then be replicated in participants of the UK biobank that
have undergone Olink proteomic profiling. For key proteins associated with IS risk, we will develop targeted
immunoassays to facilitate the translation of study findings to clinical settings. The rigorous and efficient
approach described will accelerate the discovery of new etiologic factors and potential treatment targets for IS
prevention."

Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."

 Proteins and nucleic acids within cells assemble into membraneless compartments referred to as
biomolecular condensates. Condensates display a range of material properties, which have implications for
health and disease. To better understand the origins of condensate properties, it is necessary to first elucidate
the molecular structures and interactions that sustain them. Experimental advances are enhancing the detail
with which we can characterize molecules within condensates. However, many of these approaches require
significant time and resources, impeding the systematic evaluation of condensates. The aim of this research is
to address this technical challenge and push the limits of our ability to resolve molecules inside condensates.
Biomolecules that form condensates have complex structures that feature both disordered and well-folded
regions. While extensive research has clarified the roles of disordered regions in shaping condensate properties,
our understanding of how well-folded regions influence condensates lags considerably. In previous work, we
demonstrated how data integration can create computer models that achieve quantitative agreement with
experimental results for disordered proteins in condensates. Here, we propose three synergistic research themes
that will develop accurate and efficient simulation models to characterize molecules within condensates.
 We will focus on stress granules, which are cytoplasmic condensates that are primarily composed of
RNA-binding proteins and mRNA. Importantly, stress granules have been implicated in neurodegenerative
diseases, infectious diseases, and cancers, making them potential drug targets. Yet, the biophysical rules
governing their properties and malfunctions are unclear, complicating therapeutic design. To gain mechanistic
insight into stress granule biophysics, we will develop state-of-the-art computational models to: (1) map the
structures of RNA-binding proteins to stress granule properties; (2) elucidate the role of mRNA sequences in
regulating stress granule dynamics; (3) investigate interactions between small molecules (drugs, metabolites)
and stress granules. All approaches developed in this work will be validated against experimental data supplied
by our collaborators. By examining the intricate molecular interactions within stress granules, this research will
offer mechanistic insights into their functions and disease implications. Furthermore, the findings from this
research will aid in the design of drugs targeting dysfunctional stress granules."

The immune system is an amazingly complex biological system characterized by rapid and precise cell-cell
communication, danger signaling, migration, deployment of effector functions and resolution of inflammation to
avoid self-harm. Yet despite its essentiality, the human immune system also displays remarkable inter-individual
variability. Understanding what accounts for these inter-individual differences will set the stage for personalized
therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, which constitute a major medical and public health burden. Although
it is clear many chronic inflammatory diseases have a strong genetic component, we still lack a precise
understanding of how specific gene variants specify aberrant immune responses on an individual patient-by-
patient basis. As a result, many patients receive broadly immunosuppressive treatments that do not address the
root causes of their disease, may be ineffective or toxic, or lead to treatment-refractoriness. Most research on
the genetic basis of inflammatory diseases has been performed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
or single-gene knockout mouse models. However, both of these approaches are subject to important caveats:
GWAS are predicated on an assumption of genetic homogeneity (e.g. disease is caused by common variants,
shared by those affected); while human and murine orthologs of the same gene often control vastly different
immunological phenotypes. To partially address this gap, my work combines unique capabilities in the analysis
of large EHR-linked biobanks and rare cases of Mendelian disease, together with wet-lab approaches to discern
the functional impact of novel variants on immune signaling pathways and cellular phenotypes. With these tools,
my lab will identify genes and immune pathways that have large effects on inflammatory disease pathogenesis,
and thus are strong candidates for therapeutic targeting. We identify genes and variants with strong impacts on
disease through the in-depth study of rare patients with monogenic (Mendelian) inflammatory diseases. I have
built a unique patient cohort along with a robust mutation discovery pipeline and used this tool to identify
novel genetic variants in patients with severe pediatric inflammatory diseases. I have also developed wet lab
capabilities to perform diverse molecular and cellular experiments to determine how each mutated protein
causes immune dysregulation including the use of cutting-edge single cell assays in patient-derived samples.
To determine how more common and non-coding variants in the same genes impact diverse inflammatory
disease processes, I will use Vanderbilt's unique biobank of DNA from discarded clinical samples linked to de-
identified electronic health records (EHR) to find new genotype-phenotype associations. Findings will be
validated in two other independent large biobanks. The use of human genetic data, and especially insights
gleaned from Mendelian genetic studies such as this, has a proven track record as an unbiased method to
identify targets for intelligent drug design. Overall, this research program will clarify the basic mechanisms of
chronic inflammatory diseases and point to therapeutically tractable targets."

Women known to be at high risk for breast cancer have opportunities to reduce their risk
through primary and secondary breast cancer prevention, including risk-reducing medications
and supplemental screening beyond mammography. However, breast cancer risk models used
to identify women eligible for risk reduction have only modest accuracy for predicting individual-
level breast cancer risk and perform even less well in Black and Hispanic women compared to
White women. Mammography-based AI algorithms have the potential to improve breast cancer
risk prediction, with early studies suggesting image-based AI technologies outperform traditional
clinical risk factor-based models commonly used in current practice. Multiple commercial
mammography-based AI breast cancer risk algorithms will soon obtain U.S. Food and & Drug
Administration approval for clinical use. Although promising, these models have limited
performance data in real-world screening settings and there is a critical need for rigorous,
independent evaluation prior to their adoption in clinical practice. The goal of this proposal is to
use a large, diverse screening population to examine whether mammography-based AI breast
cancer risk models can improve clinical risk prediction and reduce the inequities associated with
currently used models. The accuracy and performance of four commercial mammography-
based AI breast cancer risk algorithms will be evaluated using mammograms and cancer
outcomes for women undergoing routine screening mammography at seven facilities across the
Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Model performance will be evaluated across race and
ethnicity groups and compared to currently used clinical risk-factor based models. Finally, an
established and externally validated breast cancer simulation model will be used to estimate the
population-level health impact of adoption of AI-based breast cancer risk models for targeted
risk reduction approaches. Overall, this work will provide robust performance and patient
outcomes data that will guide physicians and policymakers for more precise applications of AI to
identify women most likely to benefit from risk reduction measures beyond mammography and
ultimately improve population-level breast cancer outcomes."
10941609,"Project Abstract:
The human gastrointestinal tract houses a diverse community of commensal gut bacteria that
actively participate in maintaining host health. Among the intricate and dynamic relationships
within this ecosystem, the interaction of bacteria with mucus, a crucial protective barrier lining the
gut, emerges as a vital and multifaceted process. Mucus, primarily composed of mucin
glycoproteins, acts as a nutrient source and signaling platform, playing pivotal roles in microbe-
host interactions. While it is well known that gut bacteria can degrade mucus and cross-feed non-
mucus degrading microbes, the intricacies of this interaction remain largely unknown. Additionally,
the ability of intestinal mucus to regulate bacterial communication is not clear and the reciprocal
interaction of how bacteria regulate mucus production is not well understood. In many ways, we
are only just beginning to understand how mucus influences bacterial ecology and bacterial-host
interactions. This proposal addresses these challenges using the expertise of the Engevik lab,
resources and reagents we have generated to study bacterial-host interactions, and the expertise
of our collaborators. The overall goal of the research program is to unravel the intricate
mechanisms by which commensal gut microbiota respond to mucus and stimulate mucus
production by the host. The Engevik Lab opened at MUSC during the beginning of the pandemic.
The Engevik lab pursues key questions: What bacterial compounds are a direct result of mucus
degradation? How do bacteria grow in communities in the setting of intestinal mucus? What
aspect of bacterial signaling does mucus regulate? What metabolites do bacteria produce to
increase mucus production? Our multidisciplinary approach encompasses cutting-edge
techniques in microbiology, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and host-microbe interaction studies
to comprehensively address these questions and delve deeper into the bacterial ecology in the
gut. Insights gleaned from this research have the potential to pave the way for innovative
approaches to enhance gut health and mitigate diseases linked to disruptions in the gut
microbiome. Ultimately, this investigation aligns with the NIH's mission to foster groundbreaking
discoveries that promote human health and well-being."
10945577,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The advances in cancer survival rates greatly enhance the awareness of side effects of cancer therapy and long-
term life quality after cancer. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and infertility are major side effects in young
female cancer patients. As the female gonad, the ovary contains various stages of follicles as its functional unit.
Each follicle consists of a central germ cell oocyte and surrounding somatic cells. Primordial follicles are at the
earliest stage and remain quiescent for months or decades to establish ovarian reserve, a marker of female
reproductive life span. Our research teams have demonstrated that commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs,
including doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CDDP), and cyclophosphamide (CPA), primarily induce DNA damage
and apoptosis of the oocytes in primordial follicles, resulting in the entire primordial follicle death, POI, infertility,
and endocrine disorders. Mechanistically, the gonadotoxic anti-cancer agents activate DNA damage response
(DDR)-TAp63-related signaling to trigger oocyte apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism remains
largely unknown. Using wild type (WT) mice and a genetically modified mouse model with oocyte-specific
deletion of all three c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) genes (Jnk1/2/3), our preliminary studies demonstrated
that: (1) JNK was selectively activated in primordial follicle oocytes following DOX treatment; (2) a selective JNK
inhibitor, SP600125, blocked DOX-induced activation of TAp63 and follicle atresia; (3) oogenic deletion of JNK
didn’t affect normal ovarian functions but prevented the induction of apoptotic genes and primordial follicle atresia
following DOX treatment; and (4) pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of JNK blocked TAp63
activation induced by CDDP and CPA, the other two gonadotoxic anti-cancer agents. Based on these preliminary
data and the fact that JNK has been found to pro-oncogenic in certain types of cancer such as leukemia, our
central hypothesis is that JNK critically regulates DDR-TAp63-related apoptotic signaling in primordial
follicle oocytes following treatment with gonadotoxic anti-cancer agents; and pharmacological inhibition
of JNK prevents chemotherapy-induced POI and infertility without compromising anti-cancer efficacy of
chemotherapy. We will use DOX as a representative gonadotoxic anti-cancer agent to test our hypothesis. In
Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanism by which JNK regulates DDR-related apoptotic signaling in primordial
follicle oocyte following DOX treatment. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of
JNK against DOX treatment on protecting ovarian reserve in a young leukemic female mouse model. Completion
of these two Specific Aims will allow us to (1) elucidate the molecular mechanisms of oogenic JNK in contributing
to DDR-TAp63-related apoptotic signaling in primordial follicle oocytes following treatment with gonadotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents, and (2) capitalize on the cell type-dependent pro- or anti-apoptotic effects of JNK to
identify selective JNK inhibitors that preserve ovarian reserve, fertility, and ovarian endocrine functions in young
female cancer survivors without interfering with the efficacy of chemotherapy."
10944153,"Project Summary: Tumor cells are exposed to a wide array of stressors ranging from hyperactive protein
synthesis and metabolism to nutrient and oxygen starvation in the tumor microenvironment; these stimuli require
tumor cells to activate protective transcriptional programs that promote tumor cell survival and growth. X-box
binding protein 1 (XBP1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) are two of the most important stress-
induced transcription factors (TFs), activate oncogenic and metastatic gene expression programs by assembling
into complexes at unfolded protein response (UPRE) and hypoxia-induced response (HRE) elements,
respectively. These target DNA sequence ‘motifs’ overlap in many target genes. Triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC), the most aggressive and metastatic subtype of breast cancer, is heavily dependent on strong
upregulation of XBP1s (the spliced, active form of XBP1), HIF1a and their downstream stress-responsive gene
expression networks. Despite the profound need for targeted therapies against these and other oncogenic TFs,
they remain largely untapped as drug targets due to the challenges of targeting protein-protein and protein-DNA
interactions. Therefore, our team recently developed a modular strategy to create fully synthetic transcriptional
repressors (STRs) to directly inhibit the oncogenic activity of TFs by blocking their ability to bind and regulate
specific DNA sequences. Using this synthetic platform, we have designed potent (low nM), highly specific, cell
permeable, and in vivo active inhibitors of HRE/UPRE-driven transcription. Our lead STRs directly antagonize
XBP1/HIF1a for DNA binding in vitro and in cells, resulting in potent, global inhibition of hypoxia-induced gene
expression programs, blockade of hypoxia-induced aggressive phenotypes, such as cell invasion, and anti-
proliferative effects only under conditions of hypoxia. In animal studies, administration of lead STRs significantly
inhibits tumor growth and hypoxia-induced gene expression, validating on-target activity in animals. The
proposed project will test the hypothesis that XBP1/HIF1a transcriptional responses can be tightly controlled by
optimized STRs that directly target their shared DNA binding sites. This will be accomplished through three
complementary Aims: 1) Develop ultra-potent, pharmacologically stable STRs for cell based and animal
studies; 2) Map STR-based reprogramming of hypoxia-induced, XBP1/HIF-dependent gene expression and
oncogenic phenotypes in TNBC; 3) Test efficacy of optimized STRs in inhibiting TNBC growth, metastasis and
chemoresistance using in vitro and in vivo models. These studies will provide fresh insight into the molecular
underpinnings and pathogenesis of adaptive stress responses in TNBC, determine the effects of blocking
XBP1/HIF1a -DNA binding at the level of chromatin and transcriptional dynamics and establish the efficacy of
targeting hypoxia-dependent gene expression on TNBC tumor growth, metastasis and chemotherapeutic
sensitivity."
10949113,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to identify novel coinhibitory checkpoint molecules operating orthogonally
to currently targeted checkpoints in cancer patients, such as PD-1. Despite the unprecedented success
of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy as a therapeutic approach against multiple types of cancer,
significant inter-individual variability remains, ranging from no response to complete remission of
systemically metastasized lesions. Various tumor-intrinsic parameters, such as tumor mutational
burden, neoantigen burden, and mismatch repair pathway deficiencies, only show limited predictive
power for favorable clinical outcomes. Therefore, complementary to such tumor-intrinsic factors, it is
plausible to hypothesize that humans have hitherto unknown coinhibitory mechanisms orthogonal to
currently known immune checkpoints and that a minor fraction of humans with germline or somatic
mutations in such pathways could benefit from exceptionally potent antitumor immunity triggered by
checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Identification of such orthogonal pathways would significantly
enhance the health of patients with multiple types of cancer; for instance, the 15 types of cancer for
which pembrolizumab has been indicated. The current project aims at dissecting the human genetic
and immunological basis of coinhibitory crosstalk between human T cells and cancer cells by tackling
the two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to delineate the molecular mechanisms of PD-L1/L2-mediated
inhibition of T cell activation independent from PD-1. This aim is supported by preliminary observations
that both primary and immortalized T cells from a patient with inherited complete PD-1 deficiency, as
well as PD-1-negative human T cell lines Jurkat and HuT78, all responded to co-inhibition by bead-
immobilized PD-L1/L2. CD83 was identified as a candidate for PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression.
The proposed work includes searching for additional candidates through RNA sequencing and surface
receptor profiling and functionally validating the candidates via RNA silencing and CRISPR-guided
knockout. Specific Aim 2 is to characterize the immunoregulatory function of CD83 in human T cells.
Previous studies suggest that CD83 can serve as both an immunosuppressive receptor and ligand for
human T cells, although its counterreceptor(s), downstream signaling, and relevance to antitumor
immunity remain mostly elusive. The proposed work includes biochemical characterization of CD83
signaling in human T cells with or without cancer cell coculture utilizing genetic knockout and lentiviral
rescue of CD83 gene. The proposed project will help untangle the biochemical and immunological basis
of human T cell coinhibitory circuits in the crosstalk between cancer cells and also substantially bolster
the applicant's scientific portfolio and expedite the growth toward an independent investigator
pioneering human genetics of cancer immunology and immunotherapy."
10946865,"Abstract. Prematurity remains the leading cause of infant mortality, responsible for well over 1 million deaths
each year. Another 1.9 million babies are estimated to die in utero from stillbirth. We do not have effective
cures because our understanding of how pregnancy works remains rudimentary. Important clues come from
human epidemiological studies highlighting protective benefits of prior pregnancy against complications in
future pregnancy, and the partner specificity of these effects. For example, the risk of preeclampsia is sharply
reduced in women with prior healthy pregnancy, but rebounds with a change in paternity in subsequent
pregnancy. Partner-specific resiliency against pregnancy complications is reproduced in mice using inbred
strains expressing defined MHC haplotype or other model antigens for siring first and subsequent pregnancies.
These parallels establish our scientific premise that investigating how fetal-expressed antigens are recognized
and remembered by mothers will efficiently unveil essential new knowledge on how pregnancy works, and
urgently needed strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy in humans and mice each stimulate
expansion of immune suppressive maternal CD4 T cells that express the FOXP3 transcriptional regulator,
called regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tracking maternal CD4 cells using antigen-specific tools show selective Treg
expansion among cells with fetal-specificity. In turn, resiliency against pregnancy complications is associated
with postpartum persistence fetal-specific “memory” Tregs, establishing an instructive framework for
investigating how mothers immunologically remember their children. Our recent studies tracking maternal CD4
cells using FOXP3 lineage fate tracking reporter mice further show a large proportion (40-70%) of fetal-specific
Tregs loose FOXP3 expression after parturition. These FOXP3-negative “exTregs” are essential for enhanced
resiliency against complications in future pregnancy, because their depletion overrides the protective benefits
of adoptively transferred postpartum donor splenocytes. At the same time, these findings also highlight exciting
new gaps in knowledge regarding the interplay between FOXP3 expression plasticity, fetal tolerance and
pregnancy outcomes. These knowledge gaps, directly aligned with the goals of RFA-AI-23-027, Immune
mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface, will be addressed through the following specific aims designed to
further investigate our overall hypothesis that mothers remember not only through fetal-specific FOXP3+ Treg
memory, but also via exTregs with distinct phenotypic and functional features: Establish the suppressive
molecules utilized by exTregs and FOXP3+ Tregs for enhanced resiliency against pregnancy complications
(Aim 1), Investigate maternal CD4 cell differentiation after fractured fetal tolerance induced pregnancy
complications (Aim 2), and Determine whether pregnancy primed exTregs are committed for FOXP3 re-
expression or liable to proinflammatory differentiation with fetal antigen re-stimulation in the physiologically
relevant non-tolerogenic context of solid organ transplantation (Aim 3)."

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of bacterial infections in the United States (US), including skin and
soft tissue infections and invasive infections (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia and necrotizing fasciitis). Carriage of S.
aureus is an established risk factor for infection. Despite observed carriage prevalence similar to that in the
general United States population, Indigenous populations experience a disproportionate burden of S. aureus
disease, largely due to disparities in the social determinants of health. Decolonization can be achieved using a
variety of regimens, each of which has requirements that could be challenging in under-resourced settings. In
addition, people are often re-colonized after one-time decolonization and recurrent infections are common.
Existing strategies have not been sufficient to control disease and a better understanding of the epidemiology
of S. aureus carriage is needed so that effective and feasible approaches to decolonization can be developed.
This proposal builds on a long-standing partnership between the Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health,
the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the Indian Health Service to produce infectious disease and behavior
change interventions that have been scaled across Indigenous populations and the world. We are currently
evaluating a community-informed and novel approach to achieve long-term carriage suppression using a
combined education and sustained biomedical intervention in the W hite Mountain Apache community in work
funded through the Native American Research Centers for Health Program. In this proposal, we will expand
this work to answer key outstanding questions about S. aureus epidemiology. Within the context of the trial, we
will: 1) evaluate S. aureus genomic diversity within households at the baseline visit by characterizing stored
samples collected from individuals, indoor pets, and surfaces within households; 2) evaluate S. aureus
transmission dynamics and reservoirs of carriage within households by recruiting and following a subset of
households in the trial for four months and testing samples collected from individuals, indoor pets, and
surfaces at each visit; and 3) assess reacquisition of S. aureus among individuals receiving a carriage
suppression regimen in the trial by characterizing stored samples from each visit. This work will generate
critical preliminary data that will inform the design and evaluation of decolonization interventions to be
implemented in similarly under-resourced and burdened communities."

Birth defects occur in 1 in 33 individuals and result in yearly healthcare costs in the United States of America of
>$23 billion. Understanding genetic causes of birth defects can provide insights into molecular pathways and
ultimately provide a path towards therapeutics. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program with
its short name of “Kids First” is a program that was created to investigate cancer and birth defects in children. In
this program, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been generated in combination with collection of
phenotype(s). The R03 PAR-23-075 on “Small Research Grants for Analyses of Gabriella Miller Kids First
Pediatric Research Data” encourages submission of applications focused on analyzing Kids First. In this
proposal, we specifically focus on detection and analyses of de novo variants (DNVs) in the cohorts with birth
defects. DNVs are important in human diseases and have been shown to contribute to birth defects. We have
developed several tools to detect, quality check, and statistically assess DNVs in both the nuclear and
mitochondrial genome. The Kids First Data Portal does not currently have DNV callsets from either the nuclear
or mitochondrial genomes. DNVs are likely contributors to the birth defects represented in Kids First and it is
critical to generate a comprehensive high quality DNV callset for this dataset. Through this R03 mechanism, we
will generate nuclear and mitochondrial DNV callsets for all 6,080 families with birth defects in Kids First for use
by others and ourselves. Once we have the DNV callsets we will test for enrichment of protein-coding DNVs in
relation to birth defects. Protein-coding DNVs are the most straightforward to interpret and we are well prepared
to perform these analyses as evidenced by our previous work. The two aims we will pursue in this grant include
comprehensive DNV calling and assessment of protein-coding DNVs in the nuclear genome (Aim 1) and the
mitochondrial genome (Aim 2). There are three expected outcomes of our study including 1) identification of new
genes involved in birth defects, 2) comprehensive DNV callsets for use by others with interest in birth defects,
and 3) integration of our DNV tools (HAT, EGP) in the Kids First Data Portal for use as additional families are
added to the portal. Overall, our work will make substantial progress in understanding genetic aspects of birth
defects."
10952944,"Project Summary/Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) reduces the voluntary movements, emotional expressions, and life expectancy of
about one million Americans. Early identification and treatment of PD reduces costs and is associated with
better therapeutic outcomes. There are putative signs of PD (i.e., prodromal PD) more than 20 years before
clinical diagnosis (i.e., clinical PD). Given the 60,000 to 95,000 North Americans diagnosed with PD every year
and the $52 billion annual cost of treating PD, new methods for early identification of PD are urgently needed.
Color vision deficiencies (CVDs) may be a valuable biomarker of prodromal PD. PD-related changes in color
vision (CV) remain unexplored, however, because present CV assessments are not sensitive/specific enough,
or are unsuitable for people with PD-related cognitive impairments and/or motor deficits (CIs/MDs).
We recently developed a brain-computer interface (BCI)-based CV assessment that has significant advantages
over present behavior-based approaches. As a first step towards BCI-based CV assessment for the identification
of prodromal PD, we propose to test whether BCI-based CV assessment can identify CVDs related to clinical PD.
It is our hypothesis that the new BCI-based method has sufficient sensitivity/specificity and test-retest reliability
to detect PD-related CVDs. To test this hypothesis, we have two specific aims:
1. Demonstrate the ability of the BCI-based CV assessment to more accurately identify CVDs related
 to PD than present behavior-based CV assessments. People with PD and controls will be recruited
 to complete BCI- and behavior-based CV assessments. We expect that BCI-based CV assessment will
 more accurately classify individuals with PD as having CVDs (i.e., have enhanced sensitivity) and individuals
 without PD as not having CVDs (i.e., have enhanced specificity) than behavior-based CV assessments.
2. Show that the test-retest reliability of BCI-based CV assessment is higher than the “gold-standard”
 behavior-based CV assessment in people with PD. People with PD and controls will be recruited to com-
 plete BCI- and “gold-standard” behavior-based CV assessments three times each; participants with PD will
 undergo a neurological evaluation. We will analyze the test-retest reliability of the CV assessments and cor-
 relations between test-retest reliability and PD stage, CIs, and MDs. We predict that the test-retest reliability
 of the BCI-based CV assessment will be higher in people with PD-related CIs/MDs.
In summary, the purpose of this research is to identify PD-related changes in CV using a new BCI-based
approach; it is hypothesized that this method will have enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability
compared to present behavior-based CV assessments. A sensitive/specific CV assessment for detecting PD-
related CVDs would enable earlier detection and diagnosis of PD and improved monitoring of PD progression.
In addition, a sensitive/specific CV assessment could enable detection of CVDs caused by other neurological
disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)."
10953165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Due to underrepresentation in genetic studies and reference panels, the promise of precision medicine for early
detection, targeted treatment, and improved outcomes has not been achieved universally across racial and
ethnic groups, especially in the Pacific Islander population. Moreover, the Pacific Islander community’s beliefs
and attitudes about genetic testing, including culturally appropriate ways of receiving and sharing genetic testing
results, have not been fully explored. While genetic research involving Pacific Islanders is still in its early stages,
establishing trust is crucial to ensuring that current and future genetic research offers tangible benefits to this
community. Forming partnerships between the Pacific Islander community and academic researchers, promoting
open dialogues, and providing community-supported guidelines are key to building trust and enriching future
genetic research. The Moana Project is dedicated to fostering community engagement and dialogue about
genetic research within the Pacific Islander community (which includes Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans,
Other Polynesians, Micronesians, and Melanesians). Our objective is to facilitate the formation of community-
led best-practice guidelines and restrictions for future genetic research projects in this community. To accomplish
this, we will first establish a partnership between the Pacific Islander community and academic researchers
through engagement, dialogue, and consultation around genetic research. This will be done by creating
partnerships with the Utah Pacific Islander Health Coalition and other Pacific Islander community leaders. These
leaders will be interviewed to obtain their insights into the project and perspectives on genetic research in their
communities. This partnership will help establish connections for engagement sessions of Pacific Islander
community members to determine their thoughts, feelings, and concerns about genetic research. The Pacific
Islander community represents an amalgamation of different ancestry and cultures and we will seek to capture
this wider range of voices by doing sessions in different groups. Simultaneously, we will conduct an engagement
session with academic genetic researchers to ensure their perspectives are included. Based on these interviews
and sessions, we will conduct community dialogue events involving both the Pacific Islander community and
academic researchers. These events will endeavor to promote mutual learning, answer questions, and build
relationships based on trust. The Moana Project investigational team, in partnership with the Utah Pacific Islander
Health Coalition, will meet regularly to discuss the resulting themes from the interviews and engagement
sessions. We will do literature reviews of these themes to determine best practices. These will be used to develop
guidelines and restrictions for genetic studies involving Pacific Islander communities. This document will be
presented at a community consultation meeting and revised based on feedback. The outcome of this project will
establish guidelines for ethical genetic research in the Pacific Islander community that will serve as a foundation
for future genetic research, with the ultimate goal of bettering the health of this community."

Myofascial pain remains an underdiagnosed contributor to a range of musculoskeletal pain conditions. The 
lack of validated biomarkers limits the ability to objectively detect myofascial pain, probe underlying pain 
mechanisms, and guide targeted treatments. This proposal will address this gap by quantifying the 
biochemical, biomechanical, and structural properties of myofascial pain using advanced, quantitative imaging 
techniques. As a model of myofascial pain, we have chosen plantar fasciitis, which affects 1 out of every 10 
adults. Our long-term goal is to enhance musculoskeletal pain management by creating better tools for 
detecting abnormal myofascial tissue that enable more individualized treatment. 
The objective of the R61 phase is to use novel imaging techniques to develop a diagnostic biosignature to 
objectively and accurately determine the location and severity of abnormal myofascial tissue. Our approach will 
use a cross-sectional study design with 3 groups: plantar fasciitis (n=50), Achilles tendinopathy (n=25), and 
pain-free controls (n=25) to test Specific Aim 1: Develop a diagnostic imaging biosignature of myofascial 
tissue to differentiate individuals with plantar fasciitis from other foot pain without a myofascial 
component (Achilles tendinopathy) and from matched pain-free controls.
The objective of the R33 phase is to use novel imaging techniques to develop a predictive biosignature to 
identify individuals most likely to respond to DN, and a response biosignature to guide dosing or continued use 
of DN for myofascial pain for individuals with plantar foot pain. Our approach will use a parallel-group, doubleblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with imaging measured before, during (1 m.), and after 
treatment (3 & 6 m.). Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) DN + standard care, or 2) Sham 
DN + standard care to test Specific Aim 2: Determine 2A) predictive (Independent variable: imaging 
biosignature; Primary outcome: Pain Intensity) and 2B) response (Independent variable: DN vs. Sham DN; 
Primary outcome: Imaging biosignature/biomarkers) imaging biosignatures in an RCT. 
Exploratory Aim 3: Will develop composite biosignatures, that combine multiple imaging biomarkers 
developed in Aims 1 or 2 with psychosocial factors, to enhance the diagnostic, predictive, or response 
capability for myofascial pain. 
Transition criteria. 1) Adequate recruitment with >90% of participants in each group enrolled; 2) Adequate 
representation with neither sex exceeding 60% of the sample; 3) Minimal missing data (<5%) for collected 
outcomes; 4) At least 2 diagnostic imaging biomarkers with an ROC AUC > 0.7 and FDRs < 0.1; 5-8) Submit 
DSMP, Study Accrual and Retention Plan, Final sample size and statistical analysis informed by mock 
recruitment, and R33 transition application, including implementation of an effective sham DN."

Thiyl radicals lie at a perilous nexus between essential biological function as cofactors in enzyme
catalysis and toxic products of oxidative stress. As a cofactor, cysteine thiyl radicals facilitate a wide
range of C‐X (X= H, C, N, O, S, P) bond cleavage and formation reactions with high fidelity, requiring
selective thiyl radical generation, active site chemistry, and reduction. Their reactivity, particularly
within an active site with many weak C‐H bonds and oxidizable amino acid sidechains presents several
alternative fates, clearly manifest in thiyl radicals generated as the product of oxidative stress “off‐
pathway,” where they can form new S−S and S−C bonds, or catalyze other chemical modiﬁcations that
are deleterious to biological function. Understanding the structure/function relationship that dictates
thiyl radical fate holds promise in developing better therapeutics and antibiotics that target thiyl radical
enzymes, informing biomimetic or biocatalytic synthetic biology, and mitigating their role in oxidative
stress.
Understanding the mechanistic and contextual aspects of how thiyl radicals are generated and what
dictates their fate in proteins are essential to addressing their impact on human health. Our research
group is seeking to define how thiyl radicals that enable catalysis are selectively generated and
maintained, how this might inform therapeutic developments, and what determines the fates of
orphaned thiyl radicals. To these ends, we are employing genetic, chemical, and spectroscopic tools to
understand thiyl radical chemistry within proteins, from generation to termination, with kinetic and
thermodynamic resolution. As our proof‐of‐concept, we are applying these tools to the development
of mechanism‐based inhibitors for prominent thiyl radical enzymes in the gut, targeting Clostridioides
difficile, with precision. More broadly, however, by advancing our understanding of thiyl radical
chemistry in diverse protein milieu the resulting discoveries will provide new opportunities to
improve or target thiyl radical catalysis and rationalize oxidative stress pathways. Through
developments in each area, we will form the foundation of a holistic understanding of thiyl radical
chemistry in biology that we anticipate will have wide ranging implications, both in basic and applied
life and physical sciences."

Iron (Fe) is a redox-reactive metal that is essential for several critical physiological functions in the human body.
It plays an integral role in oxygen transport, DNA repair and synthesis, mitochondrial energy production, the
formation of myelin, the generation and metabolism of neurotransmitters, and the regulation of immune response
and defense mechanisms. The body needs to strictly maintain Fe levels as both deficiencies and excess can
result in severe health complications. A notable illustration of the consequences of Fe imbalance is ferroptosis,
an Fe-dependent form of programmed cell death that has become a focal point in cancer therapy. Furthermore,
Fe is acknowledged as a pivotal element in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Its accumulation
has been consistently observed in the parietal cortex, motor cortex, and hippocampus of brains impacted by
such disorders. Significant strides have been made in understanding the overall procedure of human Fe
homeostasis, and the principal components involved are relatively well-understood. However, the specific
molecular mechanisms governing Fe homeostasis remain obscure. This project will employ a multidisciplinary
approach to unravel the structures and mechanisms of metalloproteins integral to human Fe homeostasis from
the following perspectives: 1) Deciphering Fe transport through the membrane - Key components of the cellular
Fe-regulation system include the only known Fe exporter ferroportin (Fpn) and an extracellular ferroxidase
ceruloplasmin (Cp). Perturbation of the regulation is likely the direct cause of Fe accumulation in cells. This work
will study the synergistic effects between Fpn and Cp structurally and spectroscopically and clarify the
perturbation process; 2) Probing the interactome and transcriptome of iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) via
proximity labelling – IRPs are intracellular proteins that detect Fe concentrations and modulate the
expression/translation of Fe homeostasis-associated genes post-transcriptionally to maintain cellular iron
balance. This project will leverage proximity labeling to discern the interactome and transcriptome of IRP; 3)
Exploring the function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) - Amyloid plaques, aggregates of Aβ peptides, are
pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, originating from APP through secretase cleavage. However, the
biological role of APP remains enigmatic. Notably, APP mRNA contains an iron response element (IRE) in the
5'-UTR, hinting at a potential role in iron homeostasis as a ferroxidase, though definitive experimental evidence
is still pending. This portion of the project will investigate the biological functions of APP in relation to iron
homeostasis. In summary, the envisaged research is set to yield insights at the molecular level into Fe
homeostasis. This is foundational not just for acquiring an understanding of pivotal physiological functions, but it
also paves the way for pioneering therapeutic strategies. Such innovations have the potential to address a myriad
of diseases, ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative conditions."

The long-term goal of my lab is to develop durable cell-based therapies for treating various chronic diseases.
Engineered cells secreting therapeutic proteins are grafted into the body to act as biological drug-factories and
provide an attractive strategy for long-term cure of diseases such as hemophilia, diabetes, and liver disorders.
‘Off-the-shelf’ therapeutic cells are immunogenic to the host and must be protected from the host immune
system. Cell-encapsulation systems physically isolates the graft from components of the host immune system
and provide a safe and effective way to transplant allogenic cells without systemic immunosuppression.
Unfortunately, despite decades of intense research, the goal of developing an encapsulated cell-based therapy
that remains functional in humans long-term has yet to be realized. Two core challenges to the proper function
of encapsulated cells in vivo are 1) Activation of the host immune system (innate and adaptive) resulting in
foreign-body reactions (FBR) to the implant leading to fibrosis and cell death, and 2) cellular dysfunction and
death due to hypoxic and pro-inflammatory environments. Research efforts to combat these challenges have
primarily focused on material innovation, while very little attention has been given to engineering cells and system
that function synchronously. The changes in cellular processes within the graft in vivo and how the graft interacts
with the host immune system remain a black box. Over the next five years, my lab’s research will aim to fill this
knowledge gap in our understanding of cellular behavior in vivo and engineer cells and systems that are designed
to survive and function within the body for long periods. We hypothesize that by systematically engineering the
cellular hosts and the encapsulation system, we will be able to improve efficacy, extend the lifetime, and expand
the range of applications of cell-based therapies. To do this, we will pursue three independent research
directions, which can be synergistically combined to derive superior cell therapy products. First, we will uncover
pathways responsible for the death and dysfunction of transplanted cells allowing us to engineer resilient cells
suitable for long-term survival in vivo. Next, we will engineer stealth by reducing the immunogenicity of the
implant and presenting tolerogenic cues to the host immune system. Finally, we aim to build function into these
implants by incorporating advanced features to allow the retention of these devices on soft organs such as the
liver and heart. Given the broad challenges presented by encapsulated cell systems in vivo, these future efforts
are well-suited to the research program, as they utilize a widely applicable multiscale and multi-disciplinary
experimental framework."
10941502,"Project Summary
The highly conserved Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is essential for cells to communicate directional
information between neighboring cells to drive collective cell movements and oriented cell behaviors during
embryonic development. Disruptions in PCP signaling lead to severe developmental disorders including
congenital heart defects, neural tube closure defects, and shortened body axes. The core PCP proteins are
transmembrane proteins that asymmetrically polarize to opposite sides of the cell. Extracellularly, the proteins
form an asymmetric bridge that directly couples the polarity of one cell to its adjacent neighbors. In this way, the
PCP proteins self-organize to coordinate cell polarity at the local level. A hallmark of PCP polarity, however, is
its tissue-wide coordination, spanning hundreds or thousands of cells across great distances. The self-organizing
properties of the core pathway alone cannot account for this long-range coordination as self-organization could
occur spontaneously in any direction. Further, modeling has shown that self-organization can only propagate
locally, resulting in a swirling pattern of PCP polarity rather than tissue-level coordination. For this reason, the
PCP field has come to a consensus that ‘directional cues’ are key missing factors that must link the PCP axis to
the tissue axis. Directional cues are thought to act in a gradient across a tissue where they bias the distribution
of the PCP proteins along the same axis by regulating their trafficking, stability, or turnover. Despite a general
consensus on how directional cues could pattern PCP organization, the identities of these cues remain elusive.
As such, the mechanism of their action cannot be interrogated. A major challenge in identifying directional cues
is that they are also required for tissue growth and differentiation. Thus, the tissue of interest becomes
compromised in the absence of the cue, making it difficult to investigate the cue’s role in organizing PCP in
isolation. Epidermal tissues provide a striking readout of planar polarity in their uniform alignment of bristles,
scales, fur, and feathers across an animal’s body. Remarkably, spontaneous mutations in small mammals and
birds have produced animals with region-specific misorientation of epidermal polarity. From these phenotypes,
we hypothesize that the skin is compartmentalized into region-specific domains that require multiple directional
cues to coordinate polarity across the tissue. Further, the fact that the skin is morphologically normal under these
conditions despite the polarity defects demonstrates that the skin can be leveraged as a model system to
interrogate directional cues. Our long-term goal is to identify and study the directional cues that pattern PCP
across the mouse epidermis to reveal mechanisms that coordinate long-range polarity. By using natural variants
and taking a candidate approach, we will identify and characterize directional cues and will reveal how they alter
the dynamics of PCP asymmetry along a tissue axis. This approach addresses critical and long-standing
questions in the PCP field and will shed light on fundamental mechanisms that pattern embryonic tissues."

Codons and tRNAs are key components of the central dogma, and changes in the abundance of either can lead
to significant cellular changes. While perturbations of the balance between codon usage and tRNA have been
explored, little is known about how natural systems harness this potential regulatory system. This is a gap in
our understanding of basic cellular biology, and there is the potential for erroneous evolutionary conclusions
based on methods that assume neutrality in synonymous changes. The work proposed here will advance our
understanding of the extrinsic factors shaping this phenomenon and the dynamics occurring within the cell.
The budding yeast subphylum (Saccharomycotina) is an ideal model for studying tRNA and codon dynamics.
Our recent collaboration has produced draft genomes, annotations, and a phylogeny for 1,154 budding yeasts
representing >400 million years of evolutionary history. We also have phenotypic growth curves for over 800
species. Additionally, the budding yeasts have long been a model system for cellular biology and there are many
genomic tools available for experimentation. This biological treasure trove has plentiful data for modern
machine-learning methods and is genetically tractable for extensive experimentation.
The first aim will unravel the association between evolutionary rate, growth rate, and expression level through
the lens of codon usage. The current paradigm is that an increased growth rate is accompanied by increased
amino acid and potentially synonymous mutation rates. These traits, however, both impact gene expression
levels. The budding yeast subphylum provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously examine the evolution
of these three traits as they vary widely across the group. The computational models will be accompanied by
experimental work that modulates growth rate by altering transcriptional codon usage and the tRNA pool.
The second aim will explore how the codon bias of transcribed genes is tuned to or by the tRNA pool. First, we
will test the hypothesis that co-regulated genes have coordinated codon usage profiles using machine learning
methods. Novel co-regulatory hypotheses generated will be experimentally verified. This work will be
complemented by a large sequencing endeavor to produce tRNA, mRNA, and ribosomal sequencing data to
capture transcriptional codon usage bias fully. This unique dataset will allow us to address the hypothesis that
the transcriptional codon usage landscape is dynamic during regulatory changes.
The LaBella lab group is ideally poised to address these critical hypotheses about the dynamics and impact of
tRNA and codon biases. Our expertise in the fields of codon usage analysis and tRNA biology complements our
skills in machine learning and fungal experimentation. These proficiencies will allow us to test diverse
hypotheses on codon usage and tRNA dynamics. This research will impact many other fields that leverage
evolutionary rates, require heterologous protein expression, or try to identify regulatory schemes."
10945715,"All organ tissues contain fibroblasts and macrophages. Emerging evidence indicates that direct interaction
between fibroblasts and macrophages occur to maintain homeostasis as well as determining disease outcomes,
such as asbestos-induced toxicity. The interaction, or communication, between these cells have a role in
changing the phenotype of each cell. Activated fibroblasts express sonic hedgehog, and macrophages express
proteins in the Hedgehog pathway, including patched, smoothened, and glioma-associated oncogene. Our
preliminary data show that macrophages from human subjects have increased expression of Gli1, Smo, and
Ptch. Subjects with asbestos-induced toxicity also express significantly more PGC-1a and CPT1A in lung
macrophages than normal subjects. Mice harboring a conditional deletion of Shh in fibroblasts blocked Gli1
expression in macrophages, whereas asbestos-exposed WT mice had increased expression of Gli1, PGC-1a,
Cpt1a, and increased OXPHOS in macrophages. Recombinant Shh induced expression of acyl carnitines
necessary for FAO. These data strongly suggest that fibroblast-macrophage interaction has an important role in
asbestos-induced toxicity. We hypothesize that fibroblast-macrophage interactions via Hh signaling mediate
macrophage metabolic reprogramming and progressive asbestos-induced toxicity. In Aim 1, we will co-culture
human lung fibroblasts (HLF) with resident alveolar macrophages (RAMs) or monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDMs) from human subjects to determine which cell subset has Hh signaling. We will also determine
mitochondrial bioenergetics to confirm FAO in lung macrophages from subjects with asbestos-induced toxicity
with and without silencing Smo. Aim 2 we will determine the fibroblast cell type that is responsible for production
of Shh utilizing Cthrc1creER mice. We will also determine the mechanism(s) by which Hh signaling in macrophages
mediates metabolic reprogramming to FAO utilizing mice harboring a conditional deletion of Smo in
macrophages. In Aim 3, we will determine if constitutive activation of hedgehog signaling in macrophages
mediates progression of established asbestos-induced toxicity. We will also determine if disruption of fibroblast-
macrophage communication will abrogate this progression. By using innovative techniques, transgenic mice,
and human tissue, the studies in this proposal will provide: (a) new insights into fibroblast-macrophage interaction
via Hh signaling; (b) an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which fibroblast-macrophage
interaction mediate metabolic reprogramming; and (c) proof-of-concept by targeting the Hh pathway genetically
and pharmacologically to disrupt fibroblast-macrophage interaction and halt or reverse asbestos-induced toxicity."

Pathogenic variants in ACTA2, which encodes smooth muscle α-actin (SMA), are a major cause
of heritable thoracic aortic disease, and missense variants affecting two specific amino acids of
ACTA2 (arginines 179 and 258; R179 and R258) also predispose to moyamoya disease (MMD).
MMD is characterized by narrowing and occlusion of the distal internal carotid arteries, and is a
common cause of pediatric-onset strokes. Multiple genetic factors predisposing to MMD have
been found, but there is no identified common mechanism of pathogenesis. However, pathology
from affected vessels suggests that smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration may
drive the disease. We found a common molecular defect between R179 and R258 ACTA2
variants not shared by other ACTA2 variants: a loss of nuclear SMA function. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that nuclear SMA is critical for differentiation of cerebrovascular
SMCs from neuro-ectodermal progenitor cells, and that incomplete differentiation of SMCs primes
the cells for the excessive proliferation and migration that causes MMD. We are focusing on
ACTA2 p.R179 variants because these patients have the most severe and earliest-onset disease.
We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Using our conditional smooth
muscle-specific knock-in Acta2SMC-R179C/+ mouse, we will assess cell fate trajectories of wild-type
and heterozygous Acta2 p.R179C mutant SMCs over developmental time using single cell RNA-
sequencing. 2) We will use Crispr/Cas9 to correct the pathogenic variant in induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) from ACTA2 p.R179 patients (n=3) and assess whether gene editing restores
the SMC differentiation potential of these cells; we will also generate sequencing and integrated
bioinformatics analyses to interrogate chromatin remodeling changes during differentiation that
are reliant on nuclear SMA. 3) We will investigate the role of chromatin remodeling protein EZH2
in the incomplete differentiation phenotype of Acta2 p.R179 cells, including testing an FDA-
approved inhibitor of EZH2 as a potential therapeutic in our mouse model. Successful completion
of these aims will provide clear data on epigenetic remodeling required for SMC development and
how that development is perturbed by ACTA2 p.R179 variants. These data will also establish the
potential efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors as a treatment for patients with ACTA2 p.R179 variants, and
future studies will explore applicability of this treatment for patients with other pediatric MMD-
associated pathogenic variants. Finally, these data should identify molecular regulators of SMC
cell fate specification, which could lead to promising avenues for future research on the
maintenance of SMC identity across multiple vascular diseases."

Health inequities in older adults along racial and sociodemographic lines are persistent and pervasive in the
United States. These inequities are particularly profound among older adults living with Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One way to improve outcomes and equity in Medicare is by moving
beneficiaries into accountable care organizations (ACOs), in which groups of clinicians assume responsibility
for quality and costs of care for patient populations on an annual basis. In 2023, the ACO Realizing Equity,
Access, and Community Health (ACO REACH) program was launched. This new program differs from
Medicare’s current ACO program (the Medicare Shared Savings program, or MSSP) in that it includes features
and considerations specifically aimed at reducing health inequities among Medicare beneficiaries, including
people from minoritized racial and ethnic groups and those living in poverty. Quantifying the impact of ACO
REACH is critically important as Medicare and other payers increasingly shift towards ACO programs.
Our overarching goal in this proposal is to determine if REACH improves equity and outcomes, overall and
among beneficiaries with AD/ADRD, compared to Medicare’s current ACO program (the Medicare Shared
Savings program, or MSSP) or to beneficiaries not enrolled in an ACO program. We also hope to understand
the specific care redesign strategies ACOs undertake that might have particularly beneficial effects for health
equity, using an implementation science lens to explore these in detail. Our specific aims are as follows:
• Aim 1: Compare REACH ACOs to MSSP ACOs and non-participants on beneficiary, practice, and
 organization-level characteristics over time to determine whether REACH is achieving its goal of enrolling
 practice groups that care for high-risk beneficiaries.
• Aim 2: Use innovative within-beneficiary analyses to determine if REACH is associated with improvements
 in quality, outcomes, and equity, overall and among beneficiaries with AD/ADRD.
• Aim 3: Use an implementation science framework and a series of longitudinal interviews to characterize
 REACH leaders’ decision-making around program participation, practice engagement, quality
 improvement, and health equity, overall and for beneficiaries with AD/ADRD.
This work will provide timely information to inform ongoing updates to ACO REACH, and ways in which its
implementation could be further optimized for patients with AD/ADRD. This could help to maximize the
likelihood that ACO REACH and future programs will have meaningful positive impact on equity for
underserved populations."

Tumor-specific immunotherapy is a promising modality capable of improving clinical outcomes for
children affected with high-grade glioma (HGG). We have pioneered a ‘first-generation’ adoptive
cellular therapy (ACT) platform utilizing total tumor RNA-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) to expand
polyclonal tumor-specific T cells for the treatment of invasive and refractory brain cancers. We
have demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and promising pre-clinical and early clinical efficacy of
this approach, including prolonged disease-free remission in some treated subjects (>2 to 5 years)
and radiographic and clinical response in first-in-human phase I/II clinical trials treating patients
with medulloblastoma (MB), HGG, and brain stem glioma (FDA INDs 14058 and 17298).
 In this proposal, we will develop a ‘next-generation’ precision ACT approach using a
combination of patient-specific antigen profiling using a novel cancer immunogenomics-based
algorithm developed in our lab, a novel gene enrichment strategy that allows us to target hundreds
of tumor-specific antigens in a single pool of RNA (tsRNA), and the SELEX-CTL (Selective
Expansion of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) platform for the stimulation and selective enrichment of
polyclonal tumor-reactive T cells from precursor frequency of 1-3% after stimulation with tsRNA-
pulsed DCs. This powerful approach to generating enriched T cell populations recognizing a
plurality of tumor antigens uniquely addresses the challenge of dealing with tumor antigenic
heterogeneity and confronting the reality of patient-to-patient variation in antigen expression in
the development of antigen targeting strategies. We hypothesize that given the preclinical and
clinical data we have generated demonstrating the capacity to engender a polyclonal T cell
response against HGGs and MB antigens using DCs pulsed with unrestricted total tumor RNA,
the approach studied within this proposal of selectively identifying and amplifying patient-specific
tsRNA and uniquely identifying, sorting, and expanding responding tumor-specific T cells for use
in ACT will constitute a highly significant and highly effective precision immunotherapy approach
for the treatment of pediatric patients with invasive HGG. Our SPECIFIC AIMS will be to:
1. Evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immunologic effects of ACT targeting neoantigens and
 uniquely expressed tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in preclinical models of pediatric HGG;
2. Determine the capacity to selectively isolate and expand antigen-specific memory T cells in
 vitro from pediatric patients with HGG who have received ACT at our center;
3. Conduct a phase 1 clinical trial of precision ACT targeting tumor-specific antigens in children,
 adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with invasive HGG."

Thyroid hormone is among the most common prescriptions in the United States.
Up to 20% of those on therapy are on doses which suppress the normal pituitary
feedback system and result in a low thyrotropin (TSH) level, a sign of excess
hormone. We have recently found that a low TSH is associated with an increased
risk of a later diagnosis of cognitive disorder. This proposal aims to understand
whether excess thyroid hormone is a preventable risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias. We will look at the relationship over time
between thyroid hormone therapy, hormone levels, and dementia in several
different large groups of patients. Our goals include identifying those who may be
particularly vulnerable to excess thyroid hormone. This work is important
because thyroid hormone is frequently prescribed to those with dementia and,
with millions of older adults at risk, even simple changes to appropriately
prescribe thyroid hormone could have important public health benefits."

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a significant public health issue and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the
U.S. PC is associated with significant neurologic and psychiatric morbidities, which are associated with reduced
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Supportive care medications (SCM) are the foundation to managing PC-
related neurologic and psychiatric symptoms and thus improving HRQoL. Multiple PC studies have
demonstrated worsened HRQoL in racial/ethnic minorities. Prior research evaluating the impact of race/ethnicity
on SCM use in cancer indicated that racial/ethnic minorities were less likely to be prescribed several types of
SCM. However, the studies did not assess the contextual-level social determinants of health (SDoH), the quality
of SCM used, nor the impact of social or cultural factors on SCM use. Thus, to our knowledge, no research has
examined causal paths of racial disparities in SCM use in PC, or assessed their impact on HRQoL, leaving
significant knowledge gaps. The long-term goal of our research is to optimize medication use and improve
HRQoL in patients with cancer. The overall objectives of this application are to (i) elucidate the relationship
between race/ethnicity and other sociodemographic factors and the use of SCM, (ii) evaluate if there are
differences in the quality of SCM between racial/ethnic groups, and (iii) describe the sociocultural and
psychosocial factors that influence SCM use in racial/ethnic minorities. The central hypothesis motivating this
research is that racial/ethnic disparities in SCM use exist in PC, and contribute to HRQoL racial disparities in
patients with PC. The rationale for this project is that there is a critical need to understand SCM use disparities
across racial/ethnic minorities, and identify potential drivers. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: (1) Derive a sociobehavioral phenotype that explains SCM use disparities in racial and ethnic
minorities with PC; (2) Determine how SCM sociobehavioral phenotype, SCM use, and race influence HRQoL
and (3) Identify facilitators of and barriers to SCM use in patients with PC. For aims 1-2, we will use quantitative
methods to determine population-level racial/ethnic health care disparities from analysis of the NCI SEER-
Medicare, and SEER-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey linked databases and a contextual-level SDoH
database from the social and built environment. Aim 3 uses key informant interviews of PC patients, and
providers to evaluate the influence of SDoH, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on SCM use. This project is
highly innovative because it will be the first to derive a sociobehavioral phenotype of SCM use disparities in PC
using a novel integrated external exposome database that captures multiple dimensions of SDoH. It is also highly
impactful because it will provide new insights into the explanatory causes of SCM disparities, their consequences
on HRQoL, and the facilitators and barriers to SCM use from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, such knowledge
can lead to new discoveries, including SCM prescribing patterns and influences on utilization, and may be applied
to other cancer types with high morbidity, mortality, and disproportionate impact on racial minorities."

Pediatric cardiac arrest occurs in over 20,000 children annually in the United States, with mortality rates as
high as 50%. In children who survive their arrest, post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) manifests as
secondary organ injury with the return of circulation, including brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion, and
myocardial dysfunction. Pediatric PCAS is relatively understudied, specifically in the domains of post-cardiac
arrest myocardial dysfunction and systemic and cardiac inflammation. Preliminary data, though in small
cohorts and retrospective in nature, have demonstrated associations between myocardial dysfunction and
elevated markers of inflammation and injury with post-cardiac arrest mortality. This K23 proposal leverages the
robust research infrastructure within the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of
Pennsylvania (UPENN) to conduct a larger, single-center prospective observational study in a total of 200
critically ill children after cardiac arrest. Advanced echocardiographic imaging after arrest will include global
longitudinal strain (GLS), a more sensitive measure of myocardial dysfunction compared to standard measures
of ejection and shortening fraction. Systemic and myocardial inflammation will be assessed early after cardiac
arrest by circulating biomarkers in a customized panel of proteins associated with outcomes in other disease
processes. These measures will be individually examined for their association with hospital mortality, and
survival to hospital discharge with unfavorable neurologic outcome. Together, with clinical data, these
measures will be assessed with latent cluster analysis to create pediatric PCAS phenotypes which will be
distinctly associated with outcomes. This phenotyping will allow for better understanding of pediatric PCAS to
allow for trial enrichment in future interventional studies. The principal investigator of this study, Dr. Monique
Gardner, is uniquely positioned to complete this study with her training in pediatrics, pediatric cardiology, and
pediatric critical care, as well as her experience to date with research in critically ill children with cardiac
disease. Supported by her mentorship team and research environment, she will leverage the opportunity to
study advanced biostatistical techniques, echocardiography, and biomarker assessment to mature into an
independent patient-oriented clinician-scientist to improve outcomes for critically ill children."

consumers. Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs) are a rapidly growing new smokeless tobacco product category
introduced to the US market in 2019 by several tobacco companies. ONP’s contain a white powder, claimed
to be tobacco-free, consisting of filler, nicotine and a wide variety of flavors. More recently, “non-menthol”
cigarettes were introduced in California and Massachusetts, two states that banned menthol cigarettes,
targeting former menthol smokers. Currently, only limited data are available about the chemical composition
of these products, and their behavioral and addictive effects, especially in adolescents initiating product use.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that: (i) product design and formulation of these novel products enables
efficient and fast release of nicotine and flavors; (ii) flavors released from nicotine pouches are especially
attractive to adolescents and promote nicotine intake; and (iii) additives released from “non-menthol”
cigarettes facilitate smoke inhalation and increase nicotine inhalation. These hypotheses are based on our
published work and preliminary data demonstrating that ONPs contain significant amounts of synthetic high-
intensity sweeteners, that some ONPs contain a less irritating form of nicotine, and that “non-menthol”
cigarettes contain synthetic cooling agents replacing menthol. The following Specific Aims will be pursued:
Aim 1: Analyze the chemical composition of nicotine pouch products and “non-menthol” cigarettes for flavors,
sweeteners and tobacco-derived or tobacco-free racemic nicotine.
Aim 2: Examine the behavioral effects of sweeteners and nicotine forms on initiation of consumption of oral
nicotine pouch extracts in mice.
Aim 3: Quantify the effects of synthetic cooling agents in “non-menthol” cigarettes on the sensory respiratory
irritation response in mice."

 The genetic mechanisms contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders are highly variable across children
and families. This is especially true for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which affects
approximately 7% of school aged children. In the last decade, databases containing genomic information about
individuals and families with ADHD have been developed. However, the individuals within these databases are
highly heterogeneous, due to varying recruitment methods, ADHD diagnosis, and variable inclusion/exclusion
criteria. For example, some individuals with ADHD may have comorbid autism (ASD) or intellectual disability
(ID), and many individuals self-report their ADHD status, without a standardized approach to confirming the
diagnosis. As a result, much of the underlying genetic etiology of well-defined primary ADHD (i.e., ADHD without
comorbid ID or ASD) remains unknown. Common variants account for a minority of variance in ADHD, and our
pilot data suggests that up to 50% of individuals with primary ADHD have a rare pathogenic variant accounting
for their diagnosis.
 We aim to improve the understanding of the genetic underpinning of primary ADHD through the following
major goals: 1) Developing the largest family-based repository of children with primary ADHD and their family
members using consistent, precise, and comprehensive diagnostic criteria, as well as standardized evaluations
of parental and sibling ADHD status. 2) Identify novel candidate genes for ADHD and expand on previous studies
that have focused on de novo (spontaneous) genetic mutations, by also examining co-segregation of ADHD and
inherited genetic variants, thereby providing the most comprehensive analysis of the genomic architecture of
ADHD to date. 3) Validate our gene discovery by assessing genome-wide significance in an existing sample of
5,595 cases and 62,739 healthy controls. 4) Develop a more robust clinical variant classification approach
through integrated family histories and functional studies that will increase understanding of the impact of
variants of unknown significance and will provide a valuable resource for future genomic and
neurobiological functional studies.
 To do this, we will analyze genomic data from 1,400 children and their families who have been diagnosed
with ADHD (without autism or intellectual disability) using comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation from
two sources: 402 from our own Developmental Medicine Center (DMC) at Boston Children's Hospital, including
187 already recruited; and 998 from the IMAGE Study, for which data is available through the NIH RGR. We will
validate our findings in a sample of 5,595 cases and 62,739 controls from the NIH All of Us Research Program.
We will conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) on all participants, perform mRNA-sequencing from hiPSC-
derived neural cells to clarify the impact of a subset of variants of unknown significance, and perform patient-
and CRISPR-derived iPSC analyses on a subset of 5 damaging variants of interest."

 Psychedelics are increasingly studied as a potential treatment for mental illnesses. For example, recent
clinical trials showed positive outcomes after psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for patients with major
depressive disorder. The results are notable because of the durability of the beneficial effects after one or two
dosing sessions, in which significant reduction of symptoms was detectable for at least several weeks and
potentially up to several months. Although the neurobiology responsible for the potential therapeutic effect
remains unclear, it has been suggested that neural plasticity in cortical pyramidal cells may be a contributing
factor. However, pyramidal cells are embedded in cortical microcircuits and interact closely with GABAergic
interneurons. The extent to which major interneuron subtypes may contribute to the psilocybin-induced
changes in neural plasticity and behavior is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of
psilocybin on the three major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex. In Aim 1,
we will use cell type-specific electrophysiology to measure how each cell type respond in spiking activity to the
administration of psilocybin. In Aim 2, we will determine whether serotonin receptors that are expressed in the
interneurons may be mediating psilocybin’s plasticity-promoting actions. In Aim 3 we will test if manipulating
interneuron activity may alter psilocybin’s effect on stress-related behaviors. These experiments are designed
to provide insights into how the excitatory-inhibitory microcircuit may shape the action of psilocybin in the
neocortex and to identify cell types that are essential for the effects of psilocybin on neural plasticity and
behavior."
10946529,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ongoing evaluation of environmental cues that predict aversive outcomes enable animals to avoid threats.
However, learned avoidance can easily become maladaptive. Excessive or inappropriate avoidance is a core
feature of numerous psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD and OCD). Although pathological
behavior in these conditions is linked to dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex, we lack the detailed neurobiological
understanding necessary to design precisely targeted therapeutic interventions. The medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) is required for learning associations that drive approach or avoidance behaviors, but the circuit
mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood. Prefrontal dopamine (DA), in contrast with
subcortical DA, most strongly encodes aversive stimuli. DA has a well-established role in plasticity and shapes
activity in projection-specific mPFC neuronal populations expressing either D1 or D2 receptors (D1R or D2R).
However, the role of prefrontal DA, and D1R+ vs. D2R+ populations, in avoidance learning remains largely
mysterious. We will address these deficits using innovative tools that allow us to measure and/or manipulate DA
and mPFC neuron populations while mice learn to avoid threats. We will test the specific hypothesis that DA
generates an mPFC activity state required for flexibly learning to associate cues with actions that preempt
aversive outcomes. In Aim 1, we will use temporally precise measurement and manipulation of prefrontal DA to
thoroughly interrogate the timing and causality of DA dynamics during threat avoidance learning. In Aim 2, we
will use miniaturized head-mounted microscopes and simultaneous optogenetic silencing of mPFC-projecting
DA neurons to determine the causal role of DA in modifying emergent neural activity patterns required for
avoidance learning. Finally, in Aim 3, we will focus on D1R+ and D2R+ cell-type specific circuits by recording
their activity and electrically silencing them during threat avoidance learning. This proposal directly addresses a
pressing need to understand the cell-type and circuit-specific mechanisms that mediate avoidance learning. Our
research can inform pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and brain stimulation interventions for a variety of
psychiatric conditions characterized by maladaptive avoidance."

 2 Sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp; the pneumococcus) causes significant morbidity and
 3 mortality, despite vaccines, antimicrobials, and supportive care. Sepsis is defined as “life-threatening organ
 4 damage due to a pathogen-driven, dysregulated immune response.” The immune-centric model posits that
 5 imbalances between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune mediators create a perfect septic storm of hyper-
 6 inflammation, tissue damage, and immuno-suppression. However, no immunomodulatory therapies have yet
 7 shown efficacy in improving mortality of sepsis. Our novel model of Sp sepsis prompts us to reconsider this
 8 immunocentric model. We found a novel single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the gene encoding co-enzyme Q6
 9 (COQ6) to be associated with susceptibility to Sp disease in an at-risk human population. The variant converts
10 an aspartate (D) to a tyrosine (Y) residue, and so we call the variant “DY” (COQ6-DY). We created the “DY
11 mouse” line, homozygous for the homologous Coq6-DY variant, which suffer increased mortality after Sp lung
12 infection. We then made chimeric mice to separate immune from non-immune cell dysfunction. Surprisingly,
13 recipient DY mice were more susceptible to Sp sepsis, despite reconstitution with wild-type (WT) immune cells.
14 Reconstitution of WT mice with DY immune cells improved survival after Sp infection. Our data reveal that non-
15 immune factors drive mortality during Sp sepsis, prompting re-evaluation of the immunocentric model of sepsis.
16 To explore why Coq6-DY increases Sp susceptibility, we tested how Coq6-DY disrupts COQ6 function.
17 Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, COQ6 biosynthesizes the lipid ubiquinone (Q). Q serves as an
18 electron acceptor in the electron transport chain (ETC) during oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In health,
19 most tissues rely on OXPHOS for ATP generation. Infection induces metabolic remodeling and OXPHOS
20 downregulation, necessary to generate and sustain an anti-pathogen, pro-inflammatory response. Abnormal
21 metabolic remodeling may drive sepsis. In DY tissues, Q biosynthesis was intact, but OXPHOS downregulation
22 was accelerated in DY heart muscle after Sp challenge. Our proposal tests the hypothesis that aberrant
23 metabolic remodeling in DY mice causes hyperinflammation and increases organ damage in Sp sepsis through
24 three aims. First, we define the inflammatory and physiological derangements in Sp-infected DY recipients.
25 Second, we analyze metabolomic and single cell RNASeq profiles of infected DY recipients for predicted
26 correlations between metabolic abnormalities and pro-inflammatory transcriptional profiles. Finally, we test if
27 therapies chosen to counteract metabolic abnormalities in DY recipients improve survival in Sp sepsis. As an
28 Infectious Disease physician-scientist with expertise in cellular immunology, I am uniquely qualified to lead this
29 research. Our validated mouse model and compelling preliminary data assure that proposal completion will fill
30 key knowledge gaps in current sepsis models, and will accelerate discovery of therapies for unmet clinical needs."

Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning."

Early childhood is a formative period for establishing healthy dietary habits and weight trajectories, as such
habits and weight predict later health outcomes, and rural children from socio-economically disadvantaged
families are 26% more likely to be obese than their urban counterparts, underscoring the need to promote
foundational healthy eating habits in rural children to prevent obesity and chronic disease. Given the majority of
rural children are enrolled in family childcare homes (FCCHs), these childcare settings are ideal for reaching
rural, low-income children and fostering healthy eating habits. FCCH providers can serve as role models,
provide repeated exposure and positive reinforcement to choose healthy foods, teach children the knowledge
and skills to pay attention to their hunger and fullness signals, and foster healthy food acceptance. National
efforts to address childhood obesity call upon childcare programs to implement these responsive feeding
evidence-based practices (RF-EBPs); however, their effectiveness is not known, especially in rural FCCHs.
The team's EAT for Prevention multilevel feedback engagement model builds rural FCCH capacity to use RF-
EBPs and improve rural children's dietary intake. Preliminary studies have shown the feasibility and
acceptability of this model, paving the way for the proposed study objective to test EAT for Prevention's
effectiveness by conducting a properly powered cluster-randomized trial with 3-5-year-old children (n=200)
attending rural FCCHs (n=100). The central hypothesis is that EAT for Prevention will improve dietary and
health outcomes among children and improve feeding practices among FCCH providers. The specific aims
are to determine the impact of EAT for Prevention on 3-5-year-old children's dietary intake and health
outcomes (Aim 1) and on FCCH providers' feeding practices and mealtime emotional climate (Aim 2) and to
determine mediators of EAT for Prevention effectiveness (Aim 3). Nebraska rural FCCHs participating in
federal food assistance programs will be recruited to reach rural children from low-income families. EAT for
Prevention is delivered through Cooperative Extension, and Nebraska's FCCH and Extension systems have
characteristics consistent with other rural states, improving the likelihood of rapid and effective dissemination.
Extension agents will serve as coaches to provide personalized and targeted feedback to FCCH providers
based on their mealtime video observations while addressing FCCH provider challenges and children's eating
behaviors. For evaluating the effectiveness of EAT for Prevention with its dissemination in mind, outcomes will
be aligned with the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to
assess rural FCCH's implementation of RF-EBPs, changes in children's dietary intake, skin carotenoid and
BMI z-scores, and drivers influencing effectiveness. The long-term objective is to improve public health by
building rural childcare capacity for addressing the growing problem of childhood obesity in rural America."

Young adulthood is a developmental period during which health risk behaviors (HRBs) (e.g., substance use)
peak, but the factors that lead to sustained addiction are not well understood. Current neurobiological models of
risk taking focus on a developmental imbalance between the brain’s control and reward systems to explain the
typical heightened risk taking seen in adolescence. We have shown that the two systems involved in value-
based decision making—i.e., the valuation system (risk and reward processing) and the control system (cognitive
control)—predict HRBs in adolescence. However, patterns of brain development during adolescence that predict
continuity vs. discontinuity in HRBs in young adulthood are unknown. To fill these significant gaps, we will
conduct longitudinal analyses to prospectively measure developmental trajectories of neurobehavioral
mechanisms underlying HRBs throughout adolescence and young adulthood, and to characterize psychosocial
risk and resilience factors that influence these developmental trajectories. We propose that poverty, abuse, and
neglect are risk factors that are linked to HRBs through their impact on neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying
HRBs, and that social integration is a resilience factor that deters HRB progression during young adulthood. We
address the following aims: (1) we will assess longitudinal and bidirectional associations between valuation and
control systems and HRBs from adolescence to young adulthood; (2) we will examine whether poverty, abuse,
and neglect (experienced in childhood and adolescence) are associated with young adult HRBs through altered
developmental trajectories of valuation and control systems in adolescence (i.e., neurocognitive vulnerability);
and (3) we will examine whether social integration mediates the link between valuation and control decision-
making systems and HRBs, and moderates the effects of psychosocial stress on HRBs. This application
addresses these aims by extending a prospective longitudinal study to follow up 167 adolescents through young
adulthood (23-27 yrs) who were previously assessed during adolescence (13-22 yrs). Our sample is from
underserved, understudied communities with elevated substance use rates, and thus is well-poised to provide
critical insights about HRBs in at-risk populations. Our intensive longitudinal multiple-level data (11 prospective
measurement occasions over 15 years) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand both individual
differences and within-person developmental changes in neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying HRBs from
adolescence to young adulthood. The proposed study will (i) advance developmental theory regarding dynamic
processes of brain-HRB associations; (ii) generate new knowledge regarding how psychosocial risk factors alter
developmental trajectories of neural mechanisms underlying HRBs; and (iii) uncover neurocognitive and social
resilience factors that can be targeted for strategic intervention to prevent HRB progression and addiction."

 Whereas the contribution of tumor microenvironment to the profound immune suppression of
glioblastoma (GBM) is clear, tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate resistance to CD8 T cell mediated
killing are less studied. We performed an in vivo CRISPR screen to identify glioma intrinsic kinases that
contribute to evasion of tumor cells from CD8 T cell recognition. The screen revealed checkpoint kinase 2
(Chek2) to be the most important kinase contributing to escape from CD8 T-cell recognition. Genetic depletion
or pharmacological inhibition of Chek2 with blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that are in the clinical trials, in
combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, led to survival benefit in preclinical glioma models. Furthermore, our
experiment using ex vivo gliomas showed that glioma tumor cell intrinsic Chek2 interacts with Y-Box Binding
Protein 1 and 3 (YBX1&3). The YBX1&3 are DNA/RNA binding proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation
of immune-modulatory genes. However, the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive function of Chek2
in gliomas is unknown. Therefore, in this proposal, we propose to determine the Chek2-YBX1&3 interaction
mediated transcriptional changes that modulate CD8 T cell response using chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing and CD8 T cell -mediated tumor cell killing assay (Aim 1). As an independent mechanism, we will
investigate the contribution of Chek2 inhibition/depletion dependent STING pathway activation in enhancing
CD8 T cell response by inhibiting STING pathway and studying its impact on CD8 T cell proliferation using OT-
1 CD8 T cell assay (Aim 2). As a potential novel therapeutic approach, we will test if targeting YBX1 enhances
response to PD-1 blockade by determining the effect of this treatment strategy on the survival of preclinical
glioma models (Aim 3). Together, this project will elucidate the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive
function of Chek2 and will provide a novel therapeutic strategy combining YBX1 inhibition, Chek2 inhibition and
PD-1 blockade for testing in GBM patients."
10944984,"Binding to host receptors is a fundamental step in the mechanisms of action for many bacterial
toxins, particularly toxins produced by Clostridioides difficile. Blocking or otherwise abrogating
toxin binding to receptors not only protects against cytotoxicity but can also in many cases totally
prevents disease. In this work, we are investigating a new approach for preventing toxins from
engaging cell surface receptors by targeting host signaling pathways that regulate the expression
of toxin receptors. Targeting signaling pathways is central to the design of various cancer
therapeutics but has not been as readily explored as a treatment strategy for bacterial pathogens.
In these studies, we are pursuing this idea by identifying and investigating a host signaling
pathway that regulates the C. difficile toxin receptor chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4).
As a key receptor for C. difficile toxins, CSPG4 is required for the manifestation of C. difficile
disease and eliminating the expression prevents C. difficile disease. In our preliminary work,
signaling networks regulating the expression of CSPG4 were identified utilizing a toxin-resistance
system that discovered the Hippo pathway controls the expression of CSPG4. Our preliminary
studies have demonstrated small molecule inhibitors of Hippo signaling down regulate CSPG4 in
vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we were able to protect mice from C. difficile disease by inhibiting
Hippo signaling during the primary phase of disease. Building directly from our initial work, Aim
1 will further explore the underlying mechanisms utilized by Hippo signaling to regulate CSPG4
in the presence of C. difficile toxins. Aim 2 will provide fundamental information about how CSPG4
expression patterns in the colon are connected to C. difficile pathogenesis. Aim 3 will assess the
therapeutic effectiveness of targeting the Hippo-CSPG4 axis during various clinical
manifestations of C. difficile disease. Collectively, these proposed studies will address a critical
unmet need by targeting the Hippo-CSPG4 axis as a treatment for C. difficile and by advancing
the paradigm of developing therapeutics based on signaling pathways regulating toxin receptors."

The goal of this application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-23-275, “Using Secondary Data Analysis to
Determine Whether Preventive Interventions Implemented Earlier in Life Reduce Suicide Risk,” is to conduct
research that will integrate and harmonize existing large prevention trial datasets. The included randomized
clinical trials (RCT) were delivered before adulthood (prior to age 18) and did not explicitly target suicidal
thoughts and behaviors (STB). Each RCT consists of well-characterized participant-level prospective data with
consent that allows for the harmonized data to be submitted to the NIMH Data Archive and allows for National
Death Index searches. This study will examine ‘cross-over effects’ (e.g., unanticipated beneficial effects) of the
RCTs in reducing risk for later fatal and nonfatal STB, and related outcomes such as overdose, Substance Use
Disorders (SUD), Opioid Use Disorders (OUD), accidents, and all-cause mortality. This U01 proposal has
obtained 29 existing prevention trial data sets with collaboration of the principal investigators and data
custodians who have rights to the original data. We will de-identify, aggregate, and harmonize the prevention
trial datasets and utilize advanced computational/analytic strategies to examine whether intervening early
reduces the risk for STB and related outcomes. We will identify the most potent aspects by examining the
various components of each intervention as well as the proximal and distal targets, format, setting,
dose/duration, developmental timing, and quality of implementation. Potential mediators and mechanisms of
action (e.g., aspects of parenting, social factors, emotional and behavioral regulation) will also be studied and
identified. This effort will examine moderators of the effects of preventive interventions, including specific
subpopulations (e.g., individuals from historically minoritized and socioeconomically disadvantaged
backgrounds), and those individuals experiencing initial elevated levels of risk (e.g., systems-involved youth,
youth who had experienced early trauma/adverse childhood events). Data will be utilized from 29 trials
involving 14 programs and 42,509 individuals. With over 40,000 participants across all studies, harmonizing
data will allow for more complex, multifactorial, multi-level analyses to explore intervention impacts on fatal and
nonfatal STB and related outcomes as well as potential mediators, mechanisms, and moderators of impact.
The U01 team will oversee the preparation of a final harmonized prevention trial dataset to be deposited to
the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) with data dictionaries and associated documentation from the original studies.
This project has the potential to inform the refinement and development of future preventive intervention
strategies delivered early and scaled to address suicide and overdose in the US."

 The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the functional impact of cognitive impairment and improve
quality-of-life in women treated for breast cancer with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). The
prevalence of CRCI following breast cancer is high and can persist chronically after treatment has ended.
Breast cancer survivors often self-report cognitive deficits, primarily in executive functioning (planning, problem
solving, multitasking), memory, and processing speed. These cognitive impairments can have substantial
impacts on everyday life including work, community involvement, driving, and financial management.
Neuroimaging studies suggest this may be due to altered activity in frontoparietal cognitive circuits.
Metacognitive strategy training (MCST), in which participants are taught a general cognitive strategy that can
be applied in known and novel contexts to devise task specific strategies to successfully engage in an activity,
may provide a solution. Our overall research hypothesis is that MCST (1) will be feasible and (2) will improve
behavioral indices of cognitive performance in women with CRCI which are associated with improved neural
activation and functional connectivity in frontoparietal neural circuitry. This project aims to examine the
feasibility of MCST and its impact in women treated for breast cancer on (1) cognitive performance, (2)
frontoparietal resting-state functional connectivity, and (3) task-based BOLD activation and task-state
functional connectivity in cognitive control circuitry. Participants (n=50) will be randomized to a MCST group
(ten, 45-minute sessions over 10 weeks) or an inactive control group. Outcomes will be assessed at pre- and
post-intervention. Feasibility outcomes will be analyzed using descriptive statistics reported with 95%
confidence intervals. Treatment outcomes will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to
compare post-intervention outcomes between groups controlling for pre-test values. Cohen's d effect size with
95% confidence intervals will be reported. Neural outcomes will be examined as mediators of the treatment
group effect on cognitive outcomes with a series of path analyses. Completion of this study is likely to result in
a clinically feasible intervention to improve cognition and activity performance in individuals with CRCI that is
prepared for efficacy testing. The proposed study is consistent with the research priorities of NCI's Division of
Cancer Prevention, the Cancer MoonshotSM program, and PAR-22-216 which are to support research related
to (1) chronic symptom management for improved quality of life and reduced cancer burden and (2) fostering
greater collaboration between disciplines necessary to improve complex behavioral symptoms."

Individuals with type 2 diabetes and obesity are at greater risk for developing gastrointestinal diseases including
Crohn’s disease, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, various gastrointestinal cancers, as well as diverticulosis. In
order to develop treatments to reverse pathogenesis, it is necessary to determine how cellular changes to the
tissues of the gastrointestinal tract contribute to disease. Interestingly, the expression of genes in the stomach
are more strongly altered compared to regions of the small and large intestine during obesity. And while the
abundance of many gastric cells, particularly hormone-secreting endocrine cells, are increased with disease,
there is evidence to support that these cells are dysfunctional. The mechanisms initiating these changes remain
unclear. Endocrine cells are repopulated from stem and progenitor cells. In preliminary evidence presented in
this proposal, the candidate has found that there are more gastric Neurog3+ endocrine progenitor cells, but
minimal change in Lgr5+ stem cells, with disease, the latter of which is different from what is found in the intestine.
Furthermore, the candidate has found a cell-specific increase in Notch components in the stomach of mice after
high fat diet feeding. Using two specific aims, the goal of this proposal is to determine how obesity alters
the function and distribution of gastric endocrine progenitor cells. The hypothesis is that lipotoxicity
disrupts stem and progenitor cell homeostasis through altered Notch signaling. In Aim1, through gain-of-
function studies in mice, the candidate will directly test whether activation of Notch signaling contributes to the
metabolic dysregulation and altered function of gastric endocrine cells that occurs during obesity. In Aim2, using
fluorescent reporter mice to mark progenitor and lineage-committed endocrine populations, the candidate will
perform single cell RNA-Seq to isolate unique populations of dysfunctional gastric endocrine cells. In addition,
using a targeted approach, the candidate will also directly test, using knockout mice, the role of the Notch ligand
Jag1 in promoting the expansion of endocrine cells with obesity. Upon completion, the applicant will have created
a detailed picture on how unique populations of gastric endocrine cells are altered by obesity. The applicant will
also elucidate how specific signaling mechanisms, such as altered Notch signaling, are connected to disease
pathogenesis. Together, these studies will form the basis of an R01 grant, are necessary to permit a more
complete analysis of regional specific differences in endocrine cell lineage, and will shed light on new
therapeutics for diabetes and obesity."

Facial paralysis from stroke or other neurological disorders often causes loss of the eye-blink reflex, leading to
pain and visual disability. Eyelid dysfunction leaves the eye chronically exposed, which is not only painful, but is
fundamentally incompatible with functional vision. Further, because eyelid movement plays a critical role in facial
expression and human communication, loss of natural eyelid motion can also have negative social and cultural
implications. Unfortunately, current surgical management strategies have major limitations in both functionality
and appearance. In theory, dynamic natural blink restoration via a facial neuroprosthesis would be an ideal
solution; unfortunately, this ideal has proven elusive, due in large part to a lack of knowledge regarding the
neurophysiological mechanisms that enable eyelid function. There is a critical need for neuroprostheses that
reproduce functionally complete and aesthetically natural eye closure, blink, and other behaviors. In response to
this need, our long-term goal is to advance a novel class of neuroprostheses that are informed by a deep
understanding of the fundamental neuromechanics of the muscle that controls the eyelid. To achieve our long-
term goal, we will first carry out fundamental neuroscientific studies to establish the currently-unknown
mechanisms that link segmental muscle activation to eyelid motion and function. The innovation of this work lies
in our ability to measure intramuscular activation and three-dimensional eyelid kinematics with unprecedented
precision and resolution. This sets our work apart from all other prior research into eyelid function, and will allow
us to develop the first predictive dynamic neuromuscular model of the eyelid. In the present work, our objective
is to study the neurophysiology of how activation sequences and intensities produce blink and other eyelid
behaviors under both healthy and pathological activation. We will accomplish this by first studying eyelid function
in persons without paralysis during a range of eyelid behaviors, including spontaneous blink, reflexive blink, and
forced closure. As the participants perform these behaviors, we will record high-resolution intramuscular EMG
from multiple points within and around the eyelid, while simultaneously tracking the three-dimensional motion of
several points along the eyelid margin in high definition. We will use these data to implement a mechanistic
neuromuscular model of the eyelid musculature, which can then inform where and when stimulation from future
neuroprostheses should be delivered. We will then repeat these experiments in a group of persons with partial
facial paralysis, to study the mechanisms by which eyelid function can be compromised. Upon completion of this
work, we expect to have established the mechanistic basis for model-informed facial neuroprostheses that
restore natural blink. These results are expected to provide the foundation for development and evaluation of
neuroprostheses with the potential to improve eye health, vision, and confidence for patients with facial paralysis."

Vaccination against infectious disease saves an estimated 4 million lives each year and is one of the most effective and
cost-effective medical advances in human history. Nevertheless, infectious disease remains a leading cause of mortality
worldwide due to (1) the lack of vaccines formulations that confer long-lived immunity and (2) vaccine accessibility
challenges. Adjuvants are capable of enhancing the immune response to antigens; however, there are limits to their
efficacy. For example, alum, the most common clinical adjuvant, is known to enhance humoral immunity but have
relatively little effect on cellular immunity. In addition to exploring new adjuvants, recent studies have begun exploring
the impact of antigen release kinetics on the immune response. Using infusion pumps or sequential injections to
administer antigen over days to weeks, researchers have demonstrated that exponentially increasing antigen release
kinetics over a period of days to weeks can significantly enhance the immune response compared to one bolus injection
despite using the same cumulative antigen dose. These kinetics better mimic a native infection, in which the pathogen
replicates, exposing immune cells to increasing quantities of antigen over time until the infection is cleared, thereby
aligning with the kinetics our immune system has evolved to respond to. Unfortunately, replacing each injection of
soluble antigen currently administered in the clinic with a series of injections spread over days or the continuous use of
an infusion pump for days to weeks is not clinically viable due to cost, invasiveness, and accessibility issues.
In this proposal, we will develop vaccine formulations that exhibit exponential release to mimic the antigen kinetics of
native infections, thereby enhancing vaccine potency without alterations in clinical practice. We have developed a
unique fabrication method, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drug (PULSED), that
produces biodegradable microparticles that exhibit pulsatile release after a material-dependent delay. Importantly, this
system is fully modular, so we can combine different particle populations to construct the desired release profile,
overcoming the constraints of other passive vaccine delivery systems whose rates of antigen release inherently
decrease over time. We will first identify microparticle compositions that release diphtheria toxoid (DT) at discrete time
points within two weeks in vitro and in vivo. Next, we will optimize microparticle processing conditions and incorporate
stabilizing excipients to ensure DT is released in its immunity-conferring conformation. Lastly, we will evaluate the
humoral and cellular immune responses to combinations of PULSED particles that, together, exhibit exponential antigen
release and compare those responses to responses elicited by a soluble dose of vaccine as well as microparticle
populations constructed to achieve other antigen release kinetics. Ultimately, this approach could be used to address
the two key issues in vaccination—vaccine potency and access. Poorly immunogenic vaccines could be enhanced by
antigen delivery kinetics while accessibility could be improved by using increased per-dose potency to decrease the
number of doses needed to achieve immunity, potentially saving millions of lives worldwide."

 Vaping of aerosolized tobacco and cannabis products using electronic nicotine delivery devices (ENDS) is
increasingly popular among adolescents and young adults. The associated emerging health crisis has significant
systemic and oral health implications as nicotine (N) consumption is highly correlated with caries, the most
prevalent oral disease in adolescents (57%) and young adults (82%), with cannabis use seemingly having a
similar effect. Studies have shown that pure N enhances the growth and biofilm formation of the major cariogenic
species Streptococcus mutans (Sm) and Candida albicans (Ca), which entertain a synergistic interkingdom
relationship that is considered an important etiological factor in caries development. Limited recent studies on
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabis product favored by younger age groups, indicated that THC-
containing cannabis smoke condensates stimulate the growth and biofilm formation of Ca.
 Despite emerging evidence supporting the pathogenicity-enhancing consequences of tobacco and cannabis
product use, most research has used pure N instead of the more relevant vape aerosol (VA) containing N (N-
VA) produced by ENDS. In addition, studies examining the effects of THC or VA containing THC (THC-VA) on
Sm and Ca are very limited. Our published research and preliminary data show that the responses of Ca and
Sm to pure N are distinct from responses to N-VA at the same N content (as determined by high-performance
liquid chromatography). Therefore, we hypothesize that the enhancing effects of VAs containing N and THC
result in different synergistic Sm–Ca cariogenic activities than the same concentrations of pure N and THC.
 In Aim 1, we will investigate the impact of N-VA and THC-VA on the Sm–Ca relationship compared with pure
N, pure THC, and control VA (lacking N or THC) using well-characterized lab strains to evaluate co-adhesion,
biofilm formation, extracellular polymeric substance production, acid production, and transcriptional responses.
In Aim 2, we will validate selected findings from Aim 1 in clinically relevant Sm and Ca strains isolated from
adolescent and young adult N and THC vapers as well as non-users with dental caries. We will characterize
biofilm formation, acid production, and the highly differentially expressed genes identified in Aim 1.
 We expect to find that N-VA and THC-VA have distinct effects on the Sm–Ca relationship compared to their
respective pure compounds or control VA. Evaluation of transcriptional responses in conjunction with cariogenic
behaviors may provide physiological explanations for some of these differences. The results obtained from
clinical strains isolated from different vaping environments will (1) validate findings obtained with Sm and Ca lab
strains and (2) elucidate whether strains isolated from individuals who vape exhibit distinct responses to N-VA
and THC-VA compared to strains isolated from non-users. The knowledge generated by this study will elucidate
the effect of ENDS use on cariogenic activities and Sm–Ca interactions using clinically relevant parameters,
contributing to meaningful public health communications regarding the impact of ENDS use on dental health."

The human genome preserves a strict regulation of gene expression to maintain physiological integrity. RNA
processing plays a key central role in this regulation and has drawn significant attention in recent times due to
its implications for a wide breadth of diseases. Alternative splicing (AS) can encode different protein isoforms
from the same gene to support rapidly changing biological processes. AS often generates erroneous mRNAs
with a premature translation termination codon, which are selectively degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD) to safeguard the generation of defective proteins. This coordinated action is termed as AS-NMD.
In humans, ~95% of genes undergo AS, among which ~33% are targets of AS-NMD, suggesting that it is not
merely noise. Substantial evidence demonstrated that AS-NMD evolved as a powerful mechanism to regulate
gene expression in normal physiology and is often fine-tuned in a developmental stage-specific or tissue-specific
manner. Growing evidence suggests that AS-NMD is frequently dysregulated (induced or suppressed) and is
the root of many human maladies. Why certain genes in certain tissues or diseases are susceptible to differential
or aberrant AS-NMD regulation remains an unresolved mystery. Therefore, elucidating the regulation of AS-
NMD is crucial to understanding this vital mechanism in normal physiology and diseases, which will redefine
therapeutic strategy and significantly impact clinical outcomes. We recently showed that AS-NMD is induced in
splicing factor mutated hematopoietic defects. In contrast, AS-NMD is suppressed in splicing factor
overexpressed diseases (such as cardiac and liver dysfunction, brain and developmental abnormalities,
diabetes, lupus, and neoplasia). These provide excellent model systems to systematically identify positive and
negative effectors and underlying mechanisms of differential AS-NMD regulation. We will characterize the AS-
NMD regulation in normal cells and its misregulation (induction and suppression) in disease-specific model cells.
We will define cis-acting RNA codes that regulate AS-NMD, characterize trans-acting protein networks and their
dynamic interactions with RNA in the AS-NMD pathway, and delineate tissue-specific or disease-specific
mechanisms. Finally, we will develop tools to manipulate AS-NMD errors using oligonucleotide-based
pharmacology as a therapeutic approach. Completion of these studies will connect the missing puzzles in the
AS-NMD regulation, answer how an evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism can be exploited to turn
on pathological maladies, and develop a commonly approached innovative molecular technology to correct AS-
NMD errors applicable to a range of human diseases."
10941568,"Research on solitude often highlights the risks of spending time alone with a focus on negative outcomes, such
as mortality and depression. When positive outcomes are associated with solitude, such as increased
calmness and lower rates of depression, they are often found most strongly among midlife and older adults.
Research on gerotranscendence, which focuses on a sense of psychological connectedness beyond oneself in
aging, emphasizes healthy aging and positive outcomes such as enhanced psychological well-being. These
areas of research have clear overlap in the context of midlife and older adulthood, but there is at present a gap
between the respective literatures. This is partially because even within each ﬁeld, constructs related to
solitude or gerotranscendence are described ambiguously, making it challenging to discern when researchers
are in fact using the same construct across studies. Additionally, explaining overlap among constructs in these
literatures is non-trivial, requiring evaluation of a range of factors from personal choices to health-related
factors to external circumstances. Yet by integrating these areas of study, we will deepen our understanding of
the role of solitude in promoting healthy aging and inspire innovative research directions.
 Our project, titled ""Promoting Health Aging through Semantic Enrichment of Solitude Research
(PHASES),"" aims to bridge the gap between these literatures and thus spur novel research into healthy aging.
In pursuit of that aim, we will develop the Solitude Ontology and the Gerotranscendence Ontology, each
extending from the upper-level Behavior Change Intervention Ontology. It is of course not enough to simply
create ontologies representing core content in these literatures. To make this knowledge useful to
stakeholders, we will create a web portal to provide automated literature recommendations and an interface for
posing natural language questions about articles in and across these respective literatures. We intend this
platform to serve as a hub for researchers, educators, and other professionals to explore and delve into these
interconnected concepts, in the interest of identifying, developing, and reﬁning interventions for promoting
healthy aging. It is of course not enough to simply create ontologies and an interface to access them. We will,
accordingly, pursue an extensive dissemination campaign, involving conference and workshop presentations,
consensus-building exercises with other subject-matter experts, peer-reviewed publication, as well as graduate
and undergraduate training in the uses of our ontologies and the portal.
 Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to complete this project, with experts in solitude,
gerotranscendence, ontology engineering, and semantic web technologies. PHASES is a mission to foster
new, groundbreaking research by merging historically separate yet interconnected ﬁelds. Through this
synthesis, we aim to enhance our collective understanding of how solitude can be a positive force, contributing
to ﬂourishing and well-being in mid- and old age."
10941213,"Project Summary
 Biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites, must first colocalize in order for biochemical
reactions to take place. As a result, spatially organizing biomolecules inside of living cells is a crucial require-
ment for a wide variety of biological processes. Whereas traditional organelles utilize membranes to accomplish
this task, more recently discovered biomolecular condensates instead achieve spatial organization via phase
separation—a thermodynamically driven process that causes immiscible fluids to demix spontaneously. Over the
past decade, an increasingly large number of biomolecular condensates have been discovered and implicated
in essential biological functions including gene transcription, protein synthesis, and cell signaling. Biomolecular
condensates are also believed to play roles in numerous pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative
diseases and viral replication. Understanding the biophysical mechanisms that control the stability, molecular
compositions, and assembly pathways of intracellular biomolecular condensates is therefore of critical impor-
tance. However, fundamental questions regarding the regulation of these structures—particularly in the hetero-
geneous intracellular environment—remain unanswered.
 My research program uses theoretical and computational methods to uncover the molecular determinants of
biomolecular condensate compositional control and assembly mechanisms. Our approach to these fundamen-
tal biophysical problems leverages our unique expertise in combining molecular simulation, optimization theory,
and machine-learning strategies, and builds on our recent successes developing predictive theories of multi-
component phase separation and self-assembly kinetics. Over the next five years, we will focus our efforts on
answering two key biophysical questions underlying intracellular condensate assembly. First, to understand how
protein/RNA condensates can perform distinct biological functions in heterogeneous environments, we are de-
veloping computational models to map mixtures of protein/RNA sequences to distinct condensate compositions.
Our innovative approach combines data-driven machine-learning models with optimization techniques, which
will ultimately allow us to design protein and RNA sequences to rationally manipulate condensate-based spatial
organization in vivo. Second, to understand the mechanisms by which certain nuclear condensates assemble
at specific locations on chromatin, we are developing simulation models to predict the nucleation pathways of
chromatin-associated condensates. Our simulation strategy will provide essential insights and quantitative pre-
dictions of how histone modifications and transcription factors regulate the assembly of chromatin-associated
condensates. Our approaches to these questions emphasize experimentally testable predictions, and we are
working closely with experimental collaborators to validate the results of our models. In this way, our theoretical
and computational studies will advance the state-of-the-art in biomolecular condensate research, and also pave
with way for therapeutic applications based on manipulating this form of intracellular spatial organization."
10946430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The sense of smell mainly plays a priming role in eating behavior. Recently, we observed that relatively long
time food (chow)-derived odor exposure suppresses both chow and high fat diet intake in mice. Further, we
found that a subset of neurons in the ventral subiculum (vSub) are activated by food odor and send monosynaptic
projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Additionally, we found that inhibition of these neurons
attenuated the hypophagic response induced by food-derived odor exposure. Based on this, the first objective
of this proposal is to determine the physiological relevance of food odor-responsive vSub neurons in regulation
of food intake. Noteworthy, we will determine the transcriptomic features of food odor-activated vSub neurons,
which could potentially identify a novel neuron population that govern olfactory sensation-regulated feeding
behavior. Using chronic activation and inhibition model, the second objective is to explore the long-term
implications of vSub → VMH circuit in body weight regulation. We also discovered that VMH-projecting vSub
neurons receive strong synaptic inputs from OB neurons. Furthermore, we observed that activation of vSub-
projecting OB neurons suppresses food intake and body weight gain. Building on this observation, the third
objective is to elucidate the functional sufficiency and necessity of the OB→ vSub→ VMH circuit in the regulation
of systemic energy homeostasis.
The current proposal aims to determine how the olfactory bulb (OB)-originated neural circuits mediate food-
derived odor-induced satiety. Our studies will advance our current understanding about the sensory inputs in
regulating feeding behavior. This may facilitate development of novel therapies for related human diseases, such
as obesity and eating disorders. Therefore, this proposed research is directly relevant to public health and the
NIH’s mission."
10940962,"ABSTRACT
The overall goals of this proposal are to develop an understanding of the factors driving the efficacy of potential
clinical combinations of a new class of fast acting antimalarial, the ATP4 inhibitors (ATP4i), including
pharmacology enforcing speed of action and total cidality and the selection of new ATP4i resistant strains of P.
falciparum that are competent to propagate in vivo and thus would provide clinically relevant ATP4i resistance.
The key goal is to understand how specific drug partners could potentially prevent development of ATP4i
resistant parasites. The project centers on the ATP4i SJ733, which has recently successfully completed Phase
2a trials and provides rapid pharmacodynamics in humans for both P. falciparum and P. vivax malarias. The
basic approach will be examining patterns of efficacy and resistance acquisition in both in vitro and in vivo
models. This approach allows understanding how ATP4i inhibitor’s unique host-mediated clearance mechanism
– the removal of infected, treated erythrocytes by macrophages and the spleen – leads to disparities between
predicting resistance risk using in vitro methods and the actual clinical risk. Drug combinations to be examined
include: pyronaridine, lumefantrine, piperaquine, artesunate, tafenoquine and the triple combination artemether-
lumefantrine. The health relatedness of this project is the potential to develop new ATP4i based combination
antimalarial drugs that possess intrinsically low risk for resistance development and could replace the ACTs. We
have previously developed and carried out all the required in vitro and in vivo pharmacological modeling,
genomics, and genetic methods for testing candidate resistance-conferring mutations. In Aim 1, we will carry
out in vitro experiments using combination drug exposure patterns matched to what would be seen in patients
to both examine total cidality of the combinations and the frequency and nature of resistance-conferring
mutations selected in cultured parasites. In Aim 2, we will carry out in vivo experiments using combination drugs
dosed so to match blood drug exposure patterns seen in patients to both examine total cidality of the
combinations and the frequency and nature of resistance-conferring mutations selected during infections in
humanized mice. In Aim 3, we will characterize genomic changes in parasites selected by both approaches,
identify candidate resistance-conferring changes, and generate knock-in strains of P. falciparum to test the
function of candidate changes. Overall, this innovative project will teach us how ATP4i drug combinations
reinforce the fast-acting pharmacodynamics of the class, how resistance develops to ATP4i, and how the
genomic changes in the parasite interact with the host-driven clearance mechanism to define which mutants are
competent for growth in vivo. Ultimately this should allow designing the optimal drug combination to best protect
the ATP4i from resistance acquisition and allow development of a drug to replace the ACTs."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Currently, about 6.5 million
Americans are living with AD. Alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to cost the US $321 billion per
year and this number is expected to 1 trillion by 2050, yet no small molecule therapeutic agent on the horizon
that clearly alters the disease progression and inevitable cognitive decline. The small molecule drugs and
anti-bodies that have been developed based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis showed a limited (if any)
disease modifying benefit so far. Thus, it would be very important to validate novel drug targets and small
molecules that work through a novel mechanism of action for future AD therapy. Neuroinflammation is
recognized as a key phenotype in the AD brain that is associated with the development of dementia.
Prostaglandin-E2 receptor EP2, which acts downstream of complex signaling by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
appears as a key driver of neuroinflammation. Activation of this receptor further induces COX-2 creating a
vicious reactive cycle in the brain. We have recently developed a suite of small-molecule antagonists for this
receptor and derived a proof-of-concept in 5xFAD mouse models demonstrating antagonism of EP2
attenuates neuroinflammation and the amyloid load in the brain. Moreover, we have validated that EP2
receptor antagonism is associated with cognition sparing benefits in acute brain injury models of status
epilepticus and a peripheral inflammatory sepsis model. We have identified several preclinical lead
candidates for development into a clinical lead and candidate drug to mitigate neuroinflammation and
cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s patients. We now propose to define PK/PD relations of the lead EP2
antagonists on Alzheimer’s pathology markers in the brain and determine PK/PD relation on the AD relevant
biomarkers in the blood (plasma), CSF and the brain tissue in two different mouse (5xFAD and APPSAA)
models that that display features of early-onset of AD (EOAD) and late-onset of AD (LOAD) in human.
Furthermore, we proposed to conduct drug development studies to determine therapeutic index and NOAEL
for the lead EP2 antagonist and complete all other IND-enabling studies required by the FDA. Our overall
goal is to achieve a disease modifying efficacy by the EP2 drug that delays the progression of Alzheimer’s
dementia at least by 5 years. We envision that targeting EP2, a specific prostanoid receptor downstream of
COX-2, rather than a generic block of the entire COX-2 signaling is a superior therapeutic strategy for AD
that will bypass the adverse cardiovascular events found with chronic dosing of COX-2 drugs."
10946931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the deadliest form of ovarian cancer accounting for 70% of all
ovarian cases and the fifth leading cause of death in women. Only in the last six years have frontline therapy
changed for ovarian cancer patients with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation by the addition of PARP inhibitors.
Natural products account for 50% of FDA approved drugs used in the clinic today. With the prevalence of drug
resistance leading to relapse and death of ovarian cancer patients, new drug treatment and therapeutic
strategies are needed. The focus of this proposal is to study the efficacy and mechanism of the novel natural
products didesmethylrocaglamide and phyllanthusmin34 isolated and purified by our collaborative team.
Didesmethylrocaglamide (DDR) is a naturally occurring derivative of rocaglamide with potent anti-tumor activity
isolated from the Aglaia plant species, whereas phyllanthusmin34 (PHY34) is a synthetic derivative of
phyllanthusmin D, a natural compound isolated from Phyllanthus species. Recently, we confirmed that these
compounds are cytotoxic and apoptotic in HGSOC from different mechanisms of action. DDR inhibits mRNA
translation by stabilizing RNA binding of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A whereas PHY34 inhibits autophagy
by blocking the ATPase subunit (ATPV0A2) and inhibiting lysosomal acidification. DDR like other rocaglates
inhibits mRNA translation which leads to cell death; however, a survival mechanism to generate proteins could
occur through autophagy. Protein recycling can be halted by blocking autophagy with an inhibitor like PHY34.
We hypothesize that DDR combinatorial treatment with the autophagy inhibitor, PHY34, are a rationale
combination for HGSOC and will test their efficacy in models that no longer respond to frontline therapy of
platinum and taxanes. We therefore aim to study combinatorial effects on tumor burden in a xenograft and
syngeneic model. In addition, we will explore interferon response from natural killer (NK) cells in a syngeneic
model because phyllanthusmin compounds have been shown to activate NK cells in addition to blocking
autophagy. Secondly, we will also determine the mechanism of action for the combinatorial treatment effects of
DDR and PHY34 in sensitive and resistant HGSOC cell lines through proteomic analysis prioritized by pathway
analysis, fold change, and validated by western blot and qPCR. Overall, we will gain valuable insight into the
role of natural products as new strategies to combat HGSOC. Implementing this research program will foster the
development of the candidate as an independent researcher and the career goals to establish a research
laboratory and tenured faculty position to further enhance diversity in the biomedical field."
10951703,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: Mental disorders are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite this
immense burden, there are significant mental health care access disparities globally. It is necessary to
demonstrate acceptance, feasibility, and efficacy of mental health care systems interventions prior to larger
scale-up, as well as ongoing measurement to ensure evidence-based, effective, equitable, and economically
efficient care delivery. Existing mental health care services access measures are limited in their ability to guide
allocation of resources and to demonstrate improvements that translate to improved patient- and population-
outcomes and reduction in mental health disparities. Mental health services evaluation in LMICs necessitates
culturally responsive and feasibly implemented measures that match local resource limitations, in addition to
having the capacity to guide both individual- and population-level changes to address care access gaps. These
measures are essential for future scale-up of mental health care service models at a national level with a focus
on systems-level resource management and allocation. Study Objective: We propose to develop and pilot a
mental health services access measurement system using existing data that is culturally responsive,
appropriate to local resources, and can guide resource distribution within integrated mental health care
systems in Peru. Aim 1: Conduct a Community Based Participatory Research focused mixed methods
needs assessment to inform access measurement adaptation for integrated mental health care
services. Overall project implementation will be systematically guided using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approaches. A mixed methods needs
assessment will be completed with patients and health care providers, administrators, and staff. Aim 2: Adapt
existing care access measurement frameworks to an integrated mental health care service model. Aim
1 needs assessment data will be utilized to systematically adapt and integrate two care access frameworks:
the HIV Care Cascade and the Collaborative Care Model Population Registry. The adapted measurement
system will generate mental health care access score reports for regional administrators to evaluate and guide
systems changes and resource allocation. Aim 3: Conduct a pilot feasibility trial to assess the feasibility
and acceptability of the adapted access measurement system. Regional health networks will be purposely
selected for pilot implementation. Following implementation, a mixed methods needs assessment will be
completed with health care providers, administrators, and staff to assess feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and
utility. Relevance to NIMH Mission and public health impact: Meet Goal 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan
through the development of a scalable access measurement system using existing data that can systematically
evaluate mental health services impacts and guide resource allocation to reduce care access gaps and
disparities in integrated mental health care systems in global settings."

Infertility is one of the most common reproductive health disorders affecting 16% of couples in the U.S. Infertility
has been historically treated as a female problem; however, one-half of infertility cases can be attributed partially
or completely to male factors. Phthalates, a class of endocrine disrupting compounds used in plastics and
personal care products, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants resulting in widespread human exposure. In
humans, male phthalate exposure is associated with low sperm quality, poor embryo development and longer
time to pregnancy. Despite major advances in understanding the molecular characteristics of semen,
conventional semen parameter analyses remain the most prevalent diagnostic tool to assess male fertility. Thus,
developing novel biomarkers of male reproductive health and determining how these biomarkers are impacted
by environmental exposures is vital to improve clinical care and reproductive health. Seminal plasma, which
comprises ~90% of semen, contains a diverse composition of metabolites that protects and nourishes sperm
during transit in the male reproductive tract and, subsequently, in the female reproductive tract. These
components have been shown to play important roles in sperm development and function, suggesting that the
seminal plasma is not just a medium for sperm transfer and protection but can also be utilized as a biospecimen
matrix to study spermatogenesis and male infertility. As such, we propose that seminal plasma metabolomics
are key to understanding how male phthalate exposure impacts reproductive health. Our objective is to identify
seminal plasma metabolomic signatures that are associated with paternal phthalate exposure and reproductive
health outcomes, such as fertilization, embryo quality, time-to-pregnancy, and probability of live birth. This
application capitalizes on extant sample and data collection from the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics and
Development Study (SEEDS), an epidemiologic study investigating the link between paternal phthalate exposure
and adverse reproductive health among couples seeking fertility treatment. We also propose a replication aim to
analyze seminal plasma metabolomics from samples collected from the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and
the Environment (LIFE) study, a prospective preconception cohort of couples from the general population. We
will conduct the following aims: 1) determine the associations of preconception urinary phthalate metabolite
concentrations with seminal plasma metabolomics in SEEDS; 2) determine the relationships of seminal plasma
metabolites and reproductive outcomes in SEEDS and 3) replicate and further characterize seminal plasma
metabolomic findings in an independent set of participants from the LIFE Study. These results will constitute
major advances in the fields of environmental and reproductive health by improving clinical assessments of male
fertility, and thus, is a critical step toward developing interventions for male infertility."

Inconsistencies between observed effects on biological versus clinical endpoints of recent disease-modifying
therapies for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) highlight existing gaps in our understanding
of biological processes of ADRD. Better characterization of the interplay between biology and the social
environment may help explain these discrepancies. To address this critical gap, the proposed research takes a
novel approach to understanding ADRD mechanisms by leveraging cross-national comparisons between the
US and India to evaluate biological underpinnings of ADRD, focusing on biomarkers of neurodegeneration,
vascular, nutritional, and inflammatory systems, and their interface with social and economic factors. With over
1.4 billion people India is the world's most populous country with a rapidly growing older population and has
very different social, economic, and demographic patterns of risk for ADRD compared to the US. Given this
novel opportunity for cross-national comparisons of the interface between biological markers of disease and
clinical outcomes, we will be able to identify common biological pathways observed in very different social and
economic contexts. Our overarching goals are to leverage data collected via Harmonized Cognitive
Assessment Protocols (HCAPs) in the US and India to assess the interplay between country, social factors,
and ADRD biology using recently collected and rigorously cross-nationally harmonized data on
neurodegenerative biomarkers, cognitive outcomes, and other markers of vascular, nutritional, and
inflammatory systems. Aim 1 uses neurodegenerative biomarkers to classify people into pathological subtypes,
then evaluates associations of other vascular, nutritional, inflammatory, and demographic factors with these
subtypes. Aim 2 associates each plasma biomarker with cognitive outcomes, while Aim 3 tests for effect
modification by socioeconomic factors. Aim 4 will evaluate the relative contribution of variance in plasma
biomarkers alongside other factors in predicting cognitive outcomes. Key innovations include cross-national
cohort integration, translational potential to interventions, biomarker research equity, and a research framework
centered on the biological and social determinants of ADRD. This proposed research is pivotal in leveraging
biology to understand social differences in cognition because cross-national comparisons between the US and
India, particularly regarding relationships of biomarkers to cognition and effect modification by social and
economic factors, will provide evidence as to the generalizability of findings on ADRD mechanisms in different
contexts. Our results will set the stage for high-quality cross-national research to identify intervention targets
for ADRD, with the ultimate objective of preventing and/or delaying the onset of ADRD from a global
perspective."
10941567,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human metabolome remains mostly unknown, presenting a major bottleneck in the discovery of new
biological mechanisms because structures are needed to predict function. There is a critical need for
high-throughput, experimental strategies to characterize these unknowns. The overall goal of this project is to
characterize unknown small molecules in humans using a combination of organic synthesis, mass
spectrometry and public data mining. This proposal focuses on the synthesis and detection of two classes of
small molecules critical to human physiology – neurotransmitter derivatives and sphingolipids.
For the proposed projects, a strategy called reverse metabolomics will be used. Typically, in an untargeted
metabolomics experiment, compounds are detected first, prioritized based on biological significance, then
structurally identified. In the proposed reverse metabolomics experiments, however, the process is flipped.
Compound classes of interest are first identified and synthesized, then their spectra are searched for in public
metabolomics data to see if they are found in humans and if so, where.
The proposed work will generate large MS/MS libraries of previously unidentified metabolites and all data will
be made public. Additionally, a novel catalytic method for the one-step divergent synthesis of sphingolipids will
be developed. While the proposed studies focus on two specific types of molecules, this strategy can be
readily adapted to study other classes of biological molecules. Ultimately, this research enables the
identification of new potential biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and pathogenic mechanisms."
10941264,"Project Summary / Abstract
The ability to visualize specific gene expression, exemplified by methods like green fluorescent protein (GFP)
reporters, has been pivotal in scientific research over the past few decades. However, most of these techniques
rely on optics, and are therefore limited by the ~1 mm penetration depth of light into biological tissues. It is in this
context that a class of air-filled protein nanostructures named gas vesicles (GVs) were developed as the first
acoustic reporter genes, which enabled the use of ultrasound to image gene expression in cells located in
centimeter-deep tissues. Since then, biomolecular engineering of GVs has rapidly expanded the use of these
unique air-filled protein nanostructures into directions such as spatially cellular control, drug delivery, pressure
sensing, gas delivery, neuromodulation, and multimodal imaging. Despite the rapid progress in the biomedical
applications of GVs, the understanding of the genetics and biophysics underlying GV formation lags behind, and
it has been recognized that the assembly of GVs in non-native host organisms is far from optimal compared to
that in the native host cells. This gap poses a significant, universal obstacle in almost all GV-based technologies,
strongly hindering their adaptability and application. Our research program aims to address this challenge by
pursuing two parallel directions. In the first, we delve into the fundamental science to unravel the molecular
mechanism of GV assembly. In the second, we focus on engineering control, using synthetic biology strategies
to design genetic constructs that achieve optimal GV assembly. If successful, the discoveries from these projects
will not only enhance our fundamental understanding of this intriguing class of protein organelles, but also
revolutionize the biomolecular engineering of GVs, which will generate a major impact for all the biomedical
applications of this class of nanostructures in molecular imaging, cellular control, theranostic nano-agents, and
biosensing."

Complementary medicine (CM) approaches are increasingly used by health care consumers, accepted by the
medical community, and viewed as a cornerstone of whole person health. However, much about the
effectiveness and safety of CM approaches, as well as the mechanisms through which they affect human health
and well-being, remain poorly understood. Published literature is a growing source of evidence on CM
approaches, their effect on human health, and their biological mechanisms. However, much of this evidence
remains in unstructured text and specialty journals. Furthermore, the quality of this evidence is often questioned.
The size, growth, and the quality of the literature makes it difficult for researchers and clinicians to access reliable
evidence on these topics. Concurrently, the number of curated databases on CM is growing, but they remain
limited to relatively narrow subtopics. Comprehensive resources and tools focusing on CM approaches are
currently lacking. For systematic use of the high-quality evidence on these topics for medical discovery and
patient care and effective integration of CM approaches with conventional medicine, scalable methods to distill,
standardize, and aggregate knowledge from disparate research literatures (e.g., CM, human metabolism,
microbiome, immunology) and curated databases are needed. We hypothesize that informatics approaches, in
particular natural language processing (NLP) combined with ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs), can
underpin such consolidation and integration. In this project, we aim to develop and validate comprehensive
knowledge resources and NLP methods for mining the literature on CM approaches including their mechanisms
of biological action (which we dub COMB literature). We will integrate the mined information with knowledge from
curated databases in a KG to support knowledge management and hypothesis generation applications.
Specifically, we aim to: (1) construct informatics resources to support COMB-related knowledge
integration and extraction; (2) develop NLP methods to mine COMB knowledge from biomedical
literature; (3) construct a COMB knowledge graph from literature and curated databases and
demonstrate its utility for question answering and hypothesis generation. The successful completion of
this project will deliver a comprehensive ontology of CM interventions and their biological mechanisms, the first
annotated corpus broadly focusing on CM approaches, novel NLP models, and an integrative KG on CM
approaches and their effects on human health. Furthermore, validation of these resources and tools on real-
world CM questions by domain experts will demonstrate their potential for patient care and scientific discovery.
We anticipate that the KG can be integrated with other biomedical knowledge bases and with evidence generated
in omics studies (e.g., metagenomics, metabolomics) as well as clinical data (e.g., electronic health records),
bringing us closer to a more complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in whole person health and
improving human health and well-being."

subunit EZH2 catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me1/2/3). Acting immediately downstream,
canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) specifically recognizes H3K27me3 via its specific Chromobox (CBX) domain subunits
and enforces repression of PRC2 target genes by chromatin compaction and 3D looping. Notably, non-canonical
PRC1 (ncPRC1) which lacks CBX proteins and some cPRC1 complexes can be recruited and mediate
repression independently of H3K27me3, but the mechanisms are poorly understood.
EZH2 is overexpressed or hyperactive in 1-2% of all cancers and catalytic inhibitors such as Tazemetostat, aimed
at blocking cPRC1-dependent gene repression, were recently FDA-approved for treatment of EZH2-mutant B-
cell lymphomas and SMARCB1/INI1-mutant sarcomas. However, there is mounting evidence that some EZH2-
dependent cancers are only partially dependent on its catalytic activity for cPRC1-dependent repression, which
explains why inhibitors like Tazemetostat can have limited efficacy. Moreover, since EZH2 has well-known tumor
suppressive roles in some tissues, there are concerns that its inhibition could cause secondary cancers. Thus,
new approaches and therapeutic targets are urgently needed for treatment of EZH2-dependent cancers.
We seek to directly target cPRC1 complexes, a therapeutic strategy that has been mostly unexplored. We
hypothesize that small molecules targeting cPRC1 subunits that act downstream or independent of EZH2’s
H3K27 methyltransferase activity will facilitate mechanistic insights intractable with conventional genetic tools
and reveal new intervention points for therapy, potentially providing a means to overcome current limitations of
catalytic inhibition. The overarching objective of this program is to identify diverse small molecules with activity
against cPRC1 and to determine their mechanisms of action. To achieve this, we have developed a sensitive,
HTS-compatible cPRC1/PRC2 luminescent reporter assay, complemented by published secondary and tertiary
orthogonal assays which already yielded a confirmed hit compound with activity against cPRC1/PRC2
downstream or independent of H3K27me3. Successful identification of small molecules can catalyze mechanistic
exploration and enable assessment of preclinical target validity, therefore advancing innovative basic chromatin
research and leading to impactful translational studies, highly relevant for EZH2-dependent cancers.

Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan."

The bacterium Treponema denticola (Td) is an important and yet understudied oral pathobiont that is highly
associated with periodontitis, necrotic root canals, and endodontic infections. Growing evidence also shows that
Td is implicated in several systemic illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and oral squamous cell carcinoma.
As a keystone pathogen, Td shows various pathogenic traits, e.g., cell adherence and invasion, stimulation of
proinflammation, modulation of host immune responses, and inducing osteoclastogenesis (OCG) and alveolar
bone loss. However, bacterial virulence determinants associated with these pathogenic traits remain
largely unknown. For instance, there is a longstanding conundrum as to whether or not Td produces
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), an endotoxin that is of paramount importance to most Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens. Early studies indicate that Td produces LPS; however, later reports from different groups uncover
that Td produces lipooligosaccharide (LOS), lipoteichoic acids or membrane associated lipids. These
inconsistent reports have been a longstanding obstacle to understanding the role of Td in the pathogenesis of
periodontitis and other diseases. During the past five years, we have been striving to address this longstanding
conundrum by using a multidisciplinary approach combining bioinformatics, genetics, glycomics, immunology,
and structural biology along with several cutting-edge techniques and have made significant progress to
understanding the chemical structure, biosynthesis, regulation, and pathogenic role of LPS-like fractions purified
from Td. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that, instead of LPS/LOS, Td produces a new
class of sulfated glycolipids (SGLs) with a distinct chemical composition and structure, its biosynthesis
is regulated in response to biofilm formation, and that this new type of glycolipids plays a critical role in
the pathophysiology of Td. To test this hypothesis, the following three aims are proposed: (1) Delineating the
chemical composition, glycosidic linkage, and key genetic determinants required for the biosynthesis of SGLs;
(2) Elucidating the regulatory mechanism of SGLs and their role in Td cell structure, motility, and biofilm
formation; and (3) Investigating the role of SGLs in Td-induced OCS and alveolar bone loss. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first project to mechanistically investigate the chemical composition, glycosidic linkages,
biosynthesis, regulation, and roles of SGLs in the pathophysiology of Td. Completion of this project will provide
new insights into understanding the glycome of Td and its role in the pathogenesis of oral infections and systemic
diseases. In addition, this application will open new avenues to investigate SGLs in other oral pathogens."

There is an incredible need to find new biomarkers to improve our ability to personalize cancer therapy, to identify
those that will have toxicity from treatment. This growing need has led to the request for proposals focusing on
these problems and searching for solutions, entitled PAR-19-325 “Clinical Characterization of Cancer Therapy-
Induced Adverse Sequelae and Mechanism-based Interventional Strategies.”
Unfortunately, there are few biomarkers that have been identified that can predict toxicity radiation therapy (RT).
RT is a cornerstone of cancer treatment and used to treat over 2/3 of cancer patients. This is particularly notable
in the context of localized prostate cancer, which is an exceedingly common cancer for which RT is a standard
of care treatment. Because survival is so high, late toxicity after RT and its impact on quality of life (QOL) is
critical. In fact, prostate cancer patients have the highest cancer treatment–related years lived with disability
worldwide, likely reflecting the high incidence and the high cure rates of modern therapy.
RT-related adverse sequelae are related to the complex local host-specific response to therapy, indicating that
germ-line biomarkers, that are present in all of a patient’s cells, will be the most likely place to find biomarkers
predicting toxicity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA, termed miR-SNPs, have been to be functional
biomarkers that can identify patients with altered stress responses to therapy. However, most previous efforts
studying germline DNA have largely ignored miR-SNPs, as these are not captured in most DNA evaluation
platforms.
Our prior work has identified a panel of these biomarkers predicting significant late genitourinary (GU) toxicity to
RT for prostate cancer patients. The PROSTOX biomarker specifically predicts for late GU toxicity after
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), an advanced form of RT that uses advanced technology to deliver high
doses of radiation per treatment session, condensing the RT course to just 5 sessions. Our group has also
shown, in a randomized trial, that increasing the physical precision of SBRT delivery reduces post-SBRT GU
toxicity as well.
In this proposal, the goal is to further validate the predictive power of PROSTOX in additional cohorts, to expand
these biomarkers to predict those at risk of acute toxicity that can also lead to chronic toxicity in prostate cancer
patients, to investigate the biological differences in the response to radiation for those that have these signatures,
and finally, to evaluate whether cutting-edge adaptive radiotherapy can help reduce toxicity in patients by further
increasing the precision of SBRT delivery. Results from this proposal will significantly advance our ability to
prevent significant late adverse sequelae from radiation for prostate cancer patients, who are a large group of
patients who currently suffer greatly from chronic toxicity from treatment."

million reported cases, resulting in over 619,000 deaths. The disease is caused by repetitive growth of the
protozoan parasites known as Plasmodium spp. inside red blood cells (RBCs), leading to RBC lysis. Among
the five malaria species infecting humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal, responsible for more than
80% of the disease’s morbidity and mortality. This parasite undergoes asexual reproduction within RBCs over
its 48-hour lifecycle, which consists of three major stages: the ring stage (~ 20 hours), the trophozoite stage (~
16 hours) and the schizont stage (~12 hours). During the ring stage, infected RBCs (iRBCs) have a smooth
surface like uninfected RBCs, enabling them to evade clearance by the spleen and circulate in the peripheral
bloodstream. This stage is metabolically quiescent and challenging to target with available antimalarials, as
most of these drugs are not highly effective against the slow-growing parasite. Furthermore, the ring stage can
enter a dormant state after drug treatment, contributing to drug resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need
for a better understanding of the fundamental biology of ring stage malaria parasites. Our laboratory has made
a significant discovery by revealing that the metabolically inactive ring stage parasite employs an ancient
pyrophosphate-driven proton pump to survive for 20 hours inside the RBC following the time of invasion. This
ATP-independent proton pump is known as PfVP1 (Plasmodium falciparum vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1), and
it derives energy from the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi), a metabolic by-product generated during
synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the ring-stage P.
falciparum relies on an ATP-independent mechanism for proton exporting and establishing plasma
membrane potential, identifying a distinctive vulnerability in this challenging stage of the asexual
lifecycle. To test this hypothesis, we outline two specific aims. Aim I. Investigate the impact of PfVP1’s loop
sequences on its proton pumping functionality. Aim II. Examine polyphosphate metabolism and PPi
metabolism to understand the energy source for PfVP1. The outcomes of this research proposal will provide
insights into how the metabolically quiescent ring stage parasite survives within the RBC for nearly a day
following invasion. Given the essential nature of PfVP1 and its absence in humans, PfVP1 emerges as an ideal
target for combating the ring stage parasites. Inhibiting this less active stage is of utmost importance to
advance malaria control and eradication efforts."

There are 26 million limited English proficient (LEP) people in the U.S. population (those who speak English
less than “very well”); the two most frequently spoken languages are Spanish (63%) and Chinese (7%). The
LEP population faces disparities in cancer outcomes, in part due to communication barriers and lack of access
to language interpretation services. Technology holds great promise for efficient, scalable remote interpreting
solutions to bridge the language barrier. However, there is still no evidence-based gold standard for
technology-based interpreting. Currently, there are 3 technology-based, people-rendered methods employed
for remote interpreting: 1) Remote Consecutive Medical Interpreting (RCMI; “audio consecutive”), the most
commonly utilized, 2) Remote Consecutive Video Medical Interpreting (RCVI; “video consecutive”), a growing
resource, and 3) Remote Simultaneous Medical Interpreting (RSMI), “UN-style” simultaneous interpreting
applied to the medical encounter, which holds tremendous promise for closely approximating a same language
encounter, decreasing interpreting errors, and improving outcomes. Further, with the rapid advance of artificial
intelligence (AI) solutions, there is AI potential for less expensive, more scalable interpreting services delivery.
RSMI HEALS will use a Hybrid Type 2 design, combining a randomized controlled trial (RCT), conducted
across 3 diverse cancer clinics, with a Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) process
evaluation, to gather both clinical efficacy and real-world implementation evidence on the optimal technology-
enabled medical interpretation modality. The RCT will enroll 576 Spanish- and Mandarin-speaking LEP
patients with Stages II and III breast cancer to compare RSMI (UN-style) with RCMI (audio consecutive) and
with RCVI (video consecutive) interpreting. Specific Aim 1 is to compare across arms (A) the proportion of
interpreting errors of clinical significance (primary outcome), and B) i) appointment adherence, ii) patient
knowledge of treatment/instructions, iii) the patient-provider relationship (using the PEPPI), and iv) efficiency
by interpreted medical fact. Specific Aim 2 is to utilize the CFIR process analysis to gather data on a)
integrating host institution and systems factors/policies into the intervention, and b) implementation potential,
through the exploration of the following: i) facilitators of and barriers to a) intervention delivery, and b)
intervention sustainability after study completion; and ii) how the interventions and their delivery could be
refined to improve future adoption and sustainability. Specific Aim 3 is to utilize evidence from the RCT and the
CFIR process evaluation to outline policy and funding implications. Our exploratory aim is to conduct error and
efficiency analyses of RSMI vs AI-RSMI, and to gauge the potential acceptability of AI-RSMI with patient and
facility surveys. These findings will inform future multisite large-scale R01 and/or PCORI-like studies to further
address equitable cancer care for LEP populations across a variety of languages, settings, and diseases."
10941034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Natural processes, such as protein expression, cell differentiation, and gene transcription, depend
on biomolecules to adopt specific assembly states and secondary structures, primarily
shepherded by noncovalent interactions. These noncovalent interactions also scaffold the
formation of multicomponent and three-dimensional supramolecular complexes that provide
access to architectures with (1) length scales much larger than their individual components and
(2) dynamic, reconfigurable structures enabled by the finite lifetime of the noncovalent bond.
However, traditional therapeutic and diagnostic interventions favor the use of small molecules
with fixed structures to attempt to interrupt or direct these natural processes. We hypothesize that,
to fully understand, interrogate, and modulate natural processes, synthetic constructs with specific
noncovalent interactions that operate at length scales and with dynamics commensurate with their
natural targets are needed. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to exploit the
synthetic potential of supramolecular chemistry to develop new noncovalent motifs and reactions
to interface with and intervene in biological processes. In pursuit of this goal, one research
direction is developing supramolecular mimics of natural chaperones. Protein folding is a chaotic
process that relies on natural chaperones to marshal proteins towards their functional structures.
We recently discovered a series of amphiphilic molecules that assemble into supramolecular
capsules and inhibit the fibrillation of an amyloid beta protein fragment. Future work in this area
seeks to capitalize on this discovery to establish structure-function relationships that relate
molecular structure, assembly properties, and chaperone-like function, and establish dynamic
photoswitches to modulate the hydrophobicity of our supramolecular chaperones in situ and
induce protein refolding. Our second research direction will establish new recognition motifs for
canonical (Watson-Crick-Franklin, WCF) and non-canonical base pairs in nucleic acids. Though
most base-base interactions in DNA and RNA consist of WCF interactions, non-WCF interactions
and mismatched base pairs are important structural features, implicated in DNA cytotoxicity and
RNA function. Typical approaches to target such structures rely on small molecule intercalators
that require identifiable binding pockets. To circumvent this limitation, we are developing bifacial
nucleobases that harness inherent base-pairing to target specific nucleic acid sequences and
structural folds. In sum, the proposed research program will advance fundamental understanding
about the molecular recognition of biomolecular primary and secondary structures and establish
new recognition motifs that will underpin the development of future diagnostics and therapeutics."

In recent years, endovascular stroke therapy (EVT) has emerged as a highly effective treatment for large vessel
occlusions (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, while our ability to achieve recanalization in these
patients is exceeding 90%, still over 50% of these patients are left with moderate to severe disability. In this
project we propose a novel classification for this under-studied population, which categorizes these patients
based on etiology of persistent dysfunction. We hope to generate an improved understanding of this gap between
successful recanalization and good clinical outcomes, to identify the cohort of patients in whom additional
measures may be necessary, and to create a machine-learning (ML) tool that will implement this improved
understanding as clinical decision support tool. To do this, we propose the following Aims:
Aim 1: We will create a longitudinal clinical and imaging dataset and evaluate more completely the role of final
infarct volume (FIV) on outcome. We will create a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from
3 large hospital systems across the US, with pre-procedure and follow up imaging at 24-48 hour and 5-14 day
time points in patients with LVO AIS treated with EVT. We will then use infarct volume and location information
from early and late follow up MRIs to predict likelihood of good outcome from FIV data.
Aim 2: We propose, derive, and validate a novel classification system for patients with disability despite
reperfusion and generate machine learning models to identify them based on data obtained prior to EVT. The
model will be trained using clinical and imaging data and tested in independent cohorts, which will be drawn from
multiple hospitals to better represent a diverse population.
Aim 3: We will create deep learning models using raw patient-level cross-sectional and angiographic imaging
data to identify patients with persistent disability despite reperfusion, and their subtypes. We will leverage our
longitudinal-sensitive deep learning models to learn from the change between pre- and immediate post-EVT with
imaging and clinical variables to predict clinical outcomes in patients treated with EVT.
Completion of these aims will provide a means to characterize and identify patients with poor clinical outcomes
despite successful recanalization. These results will establish the foundation for future clinical trials by
discovering which clinical and/or imaging features are key drivers of clinical outcomes. We will provide a positive
impact by creating a simple, universally accessible method to identify the most vulnerable patients who may
need additional treatments beyond EVT for LVO AIS."

The obesity epidemic continues to afflict populations globally. The literature is replete with observational
studies purporting a role of the gut microbiome in body weight regulation. The main gap in the development of
microbiome-targeted therapeutics to treat obesity is a deep understanding of the causal mechanisms by which
microbes impact energy balance in humans. In a first of its kind study, we implemented a quantitative
bioenergetics paradigm in which human energy balance was deeply and precisely phenotyped (energy intake,
expenditure and fecal energy loss) during an inpatient randomized controlled crossover feeding study. We
used diets that delivered minimal (Western Diet; WD) versus high (Microbiome Enhancer Diet; MBD) amounts
of microbiota fermentable dietary substrates to the colon to reprogram the gut microbiome within individuals.
We uncovered diet-host-microbe interactions that impacted human energy balance via increased fecal energy
loss and thus, lower metabolizable energy (ME) that was due in part to an increase in microbial biomass on the
MBD as compared to the WD. To advance this work, we need to understand the quantitative and functional
mechanisms by which the gut microbiome impacts ME when exposed to different diets. We propose two aims
to accomplish this. In Aim 1A, we will determine the amount of fecal energy loss that is due to shunting of
energy from the human diet towards biomass expansion (and thus away from the host) to test the hypothesis
that the dietary energy diverted from host towards biomass expansion is large enough to promote lower ME
(net negative energy balance) on the MBD vs. the WD. In Aim 1B, we will perform absolute quantification of
microbial species to determine which ones are the dominant players in biomass expansion and their
proportional contribution to fecal biomass energy. In Aim 2A, we will implement a novel integrated multi-omics
workflow aimed at determining microbial functions and substrate preferences in vivo. These data will tell us
what the microbes “eat”, which specific species compete for the same dietary substrates, and the associated
functions of the microbial community when specific dietary substrates are available. These data will be
validated in Aim 2B by performing ex vivo experiments to change the absolute abundance of specific microbes
that contribute most to biomass by addition of the preferred substrates of those microbes. The overall outcome
of this project is that we will have an unprecedented understanding of the quantitative microbial mechanisms
that drive human energy balance."

Successful management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires daily self-care behaviors which largely occur within
the context of patients’ social relationships. Chronic diseases, like T2D, have high levels of heterogeneity in
response to self-care support interventions, suggesting a sequential, individualized approach may maximize
benefits for the largest proportion of patients. Adaptive interventions mirror clinical care by applying a series of
“if-then” decision rules that dictate which intervention components are delivered over time, according to how
individuals respond. They are especially well suited to the management of chronic conditions. To date, all
adaptive interventions for chronic disease management are delivered individually; none have involved social
support. Adaptive interventions leveraging social relationships could reduce heterogeneity in response to self-
care support interventions and better meet the needs of adults with T2D. During this K23 award, the principal
investigator (PI) will address these gaps in the extant literature while participating in a mentored training
experience that will prepare her for success as an independent investigator who develops and tests adaptive
interventions to improve the health and well-being of adults with T2D by leveraging the power of social support.
Specific training goals include: (1) deepen knowledge in behavioral diabetes research, (2) develop skills in
qualitative and mixed methods, (3) apply Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to develop and
optimize adaptive interventions, and (4) lead a clinical trial and strengthen responsible conduct of research
skills. The proposed research includes two specific aims. Aim 1: The PI will adapt components of an evidence-
based family-focused self-care support intervention to target peer-support rather than family-support. Adults
with T2D (n=30) will be recruited to participate in focus groups and iterative rounds of testing to refine the peer-
support components prior to evaluation. A community engagement studio will advise protocols and recruitment.
Aim 2: The PI will recruit and randomize 60 adults with T2D to a pilot sequential multiple assignment
randomized trial (SMART) to test the acceptability and feasibility of random assignment to multiple social-
support focused interventions. The PI will report on the feasibility and acceptability of this innovative approach
to adaptive interventions as well as conduct interviews with participants to further improve the interventions
through a robust mixed-methods evaluation. Improvements, if needed, will be made prior to proposing a fully
powered SMART to optimize the adaptive interventions. At the conclusion of this work, the PI will have robust
preliminary data on the feasibility and acceptability of optimization methodology in adults with T2D, namely
multiple randomizations to social support-focused interventions, to inform a R01-funded SMART. This unique
expertise will accelerate the PI’s independent research career as an expert in adaptive interventions for adults
with T2D. Moreover, it will help the PI reach her ultimate goal of developing and testing adaptive interventions
to improve health and well-being of adults with T2D leveraging their social relationships."

Integrating digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) into aging services agencies offers a scalable and
potentially cost-effective approach to mitigating the mental health disparities experienced by homebound older
adults. This process involves using aging service providers to deploy DMHIs and assist older adults in initiating
and consistently using these digital tools. The long-term goal of the proposed study is to identify the features
that define effective DMHIs for homebound older adults and to cultivate sustainable strategies for implementing
DMHIs within community-based aging services. The specific aims are to (a) determine the clinical effects of
Empower@Home—a novel DMHI explicitly designed for homebound older adults and supported by lay
providers within aging service agencies—against enhanced usual care; (b) examine the intervention change
mechanisms; and (c) evaluate implementation process by identifying barriers, and facilitators from multi-
stakeholder perspectives. Empower@Home applies the established principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) to address depressive symptoms prevalent in homebound older adults, enriched with engaging,
character-driven storytelling conveyed through short videos. Preliminary research indicates that
Empower@Home outperforms similar programs in usability and shows remarkable adherence (90%
completion rate) and clinical efficacy when supported by trained research staff. The current project proposes a
randomized Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation intervention trial with 256 low-income homebound
older adults served by three aging service agencies in Michigan. Participants will be allocated to receive either
Empower@Home supported by agency staff or enhanced usual care. This intervention comprises nine self-
help online sessions presented via short videos and text narrations on a dedicated web platform, accompanied
by a physical workbook summarizing sessions and featuring worksheets for home exercises, plus weekly
coaching calls conducted by trained agency staff. Enhanced usual care encompasses aging services such as
case management and home support, augmented with a handout that includes psychoeducation, local
resource guides, and bi-weekly depression assessments. Depression symptoms will be primarily measured
using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks post-baseline, complemented by
five in-app assessments during sessions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. A combination of methods will examine and explore
CBT-associated, engagement-related, and supporter-related change mechanisms. Furthermore, a qualitative
assessment of the implementation process will be undertaken, with data being analyzed through traditional
qualitative data analysis and natural language processing techniques. It is hypothesized that the treatment will
prove superior to the enhanced usual care."

Why do some children at high risk for depression develop a disorder, while others remain psychopathology-
free? My ultimate goal is to elucidate the neurobiological, genetic and environmental factors that determine
vulnerability or resilience in children at risk for mood disorders, so that children at highest risk can be identified
and new interventions against depression can be developed. This goal will be enabled by the training and
mentorship obtained through this K99/R00 Award. Preliminary results show that findings from rodent models
of intergenerational distress replicate in humans. Specifically, offspring of parents with depression and distress
have decreased hippocampal structure, cognitive difficulties and a higher risk for depressive symptoms. The
research in this proposal will examine if recent findings from these rodent models, that hippocampal activity
determines susceptibility versus resilience to adverse events, translate to humans at risk for psychopathology
in a multigenerational family study of individuals at high and low risk for depression. Next, I will investigate
whether measures of cumulative genetic risk predict individual differences in hippocampal structure and
function and depressive symptoms. I will investigate genome wide association studies-based polygenic risk
scores and also derive a translational expression-based genetic risk score that is specific to altered dentate
gyrus gene expression in susceptible versus resilient mice and apply it to humans. Lastly, to determine
whether hippocampal measures predict onset of depression, investigate interactions with the childhood
environment, as well as extend findings to a large diverse population sample, I will examine these questions in
children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. To carry out this research I will receive
training during the K99 phase at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute from an
interdisciplinary team of mentors and advisors. My training will include: resting-state fMRI analysis; using
pipelines to analyze large samples of MRI data; calculating and incorporating polygenic risk scores into
neuroimaging and clinical datasets; and professional skills. The data obtained in this project will lead to future
R01 applications during the R00 phase that will determine when in childhood aberrant hippocampal
mechanisms emerge, examine the effects of altered hippocampal processing on connected brain regions and
use the genetic findings to develop a theory of the molecular changes underlying aberrant hippocampal
function. This project will elucidate biological mechanisms of susceptibility to depression in high-risk children
and give me the expertise to become a leader in integrating genetic, neural and environmental data across
species to study intergenerational transmission of psychopathology."

Approximately 1/3 of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) display inflammation that is believed to
play a causal role in the disorder, but the precise mechanisms are not understood. Experimental endotoxemia
studies in healthy individuals have shown behavioral, immunological, and physiological changes leading to a
transient depressive-like state that resolves 4-5 hours after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). While
informative, these studies cannot reveal putative, aberrant inflammatory and regulatory mechanisms in MDD.
Hence, a mechanistic approach is required to pinpoint which immunoregulatory mechanisms are defective in
MDD. This proposal will leverage an experimental medicine study involving acute administration of LPS or
saline to individuals with MDD and healthy controls (HC) to identify depression-relevant changes in the TLR4
pathway and its regulation by microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) in both the blood and the brain. The central
hypothesis is that TLR4 signaling is sensitized in MDD by a history of exposure to exogenous (e.g. pathogens,
LPS from leaky gut) and/or endogenous (e.g. chronic stress) ligands, and thus, TLR4-mediated inflammatory
and regulatory mechanisms are impaired in MDD subjects compared to HC. TLR4 detects pathogen- and
damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) for production of inflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are elevated in some individuals with MDD. Whilst
PAMPs, like LPS play a role in the pathogenesis of MDD, stress-associated production of DAMPs may also
activate TLR4. Despite the theoretical importance of the TLR4 pathway, the evidence base is currently small,
the extant clinical data are cross-sectionally derived, and TLR4 downstream signaling has not been assessed
despite aberrant expression of TLR4-responsive miRNAs in MDD. These miRNAs can be isolated from
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that cross the blood brain barrier, thus, isolating EVs of glial origin will provide a
readout of CNS-associated TLR4 regulation in MDD. Our preliminary data suggest that the inflammatory
cytokines, IL-6 and TNF, as well as TLR4 are increased in MDD compared to HC in response to LPS. The K99
phase will identify peripheral and central TLR4-mediated immune signaling mechanisms in MDD with the use
of high-sensitivity, immunoassay detection to identify changes in cytokine expression and TLR4 pathway
proteins and support the PI’s training in flow cytometry, miRNA extraction, astrocyte-enriched EV (AEEV)
isolation, and RNA-seq. The R00 phase will identify peripheral and central TLR4-mediated regulatory
mechanisms in MDD with the use of Next Generation Sequencing to identify miRNAs dysregulated in MDD
and will provide support for transition to an independent investigator specializing in CNS-dependent TLR4-
inflammatory mechanisms in depression. The ability to delineate TLR4-mediated peripheral and CNS
immunoregulatory responses with cutting edge techniques, still novel to the field of psychiatry, will move us
one step closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying inflammation-associated depression."

 Neurological diseases comprise an extraordinary burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare
system; the cumulative direct costs are $993 billion/year. Progress in treatment of neurological diseases
requires clinical research, but research may be limited by a lack of supply of capable physician-scientists.
 The previous generations of the Clinical Trial Methodology Course (CTMC) were effective in training early
investigators. Cumulatively, 62% of CTMC graduates submitted a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant
proposal, of which 62% were funded. Many others found success in funding from foundations, other federal
agencies, and local sources.
 We propose a training program with the goal of supplying the healthcare system with effective clinical
researchers and clinical biostatisticians who can implement well-designed clinical trials and biomarker studies
in neuroscience. The innovations of the current proposal are to provide a new focus in developing workable,
“fundable” grants that can directly and efficiently supply established NIH research networks (Advanced Track)
while continuing our established, valuable work with early-stage investigators (Foundation Track), as well as
developing clinical biostatisticians (Biostatistics Track). New endeavors in study design will include practices to
increase diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and community engagement. Our proposal draws upon the
deep, institutional knowledge of previous CTMCs and provides new leadership, new ideas, and new metrics.
 Specific aims are to identify motivated, diverse, and less experienced investigators and provide them with
the guidance and tools from a team of peer mentors, clinical faculty mentors, and biostatisticians to develop
proposals, based in best practices, that can efficiently translate to competitive research applications and, in the
Advanced Track, coordinate with networks to prepare proposals that are “submission-ready.” We will further
forge efficiencies and strengths of infrastructure, education, and expertise among the CTMC and research
networks. Finally, we will support career development of diverse, prepared clinical research investigators by
providing them with means to further their careers in neurological investigations.
 In summary, the development of well-trained, clinical researchers will foster better trials design and hasten
the development of new therapies. We will track participant progress (both past and future) to aid in program
adjustments and assess overall program performance. The CTMC in its new iteration will build upon proven
successes while bringing new and specific focus on neuroscience translational and clinical research. We bring
rigor, new energy, and new highlights to a valuable program in the mentoring of tomorrow’s academic leaders,
with a focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility for recruitment of faculty and participants."

Pulmonary surfactant is comprised of phospholipids and protein components and helps prevent
lung collapse by lowering surface tension in alveolar lining fluid. ATP-binding cassette A3
(ABCA3) is a cyclic AMP-activated phospholipid transporter that localizes to the limiting
membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AEC2s). Genetic variants in
ABCA3 can cause severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or later onset
pulmonary fibrosis and are the most common genetic causes of childhood interstitial lung
diseases (chILD). Other than lung transplant, there are no specific treatments for severe cases
of ABCA3 deficiency. Since ABCA3 deficiency is autosomal recessive, it should be amenable to
gene addition strategies. Complementing the loss of function with a full length ABCA3 cDNA
reverses surfactant deficiency phenotypes in vitro. Our overall goals are to 1) understand the
biological effects of ABCA3 mutations in human AEC2s and 2) actualize a gene therapy
strategy to modify the disease course by efficiently and persistently expressing ABCA3 at
physiological levels in AEC2s."
10941574,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This is a submission for a National Institutes of Health R01 award called The BLAAST Project, which aims to
conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo, non-inferiority trial of pediatric care enhanced by a novel
automated digital stethoscope, compared to standard care, in Bangladesh (Aim 1) with an integrated
implementation assessment (Aim 2) and economic evaluation (Aim 3) over three years among young, low-risk
children with non-severe clinical pneumonia. Antibiotics are a mainstay of the treatment of acute lower
respiratory infections in young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Bangladesh even
though most episodes are caused by self-limiting viruses. Innovative child friendly tools that improve the
diagnosis of respiratory illnesses, safely reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, and are suitable for
implementation in LMICs are urgently required to safely improve antibiotic stewardship and stem the rising
rates of antibiotic resistance globally.
In this project (Bangladesh Lung Auscultation Artificial Intelligence for Antibiotic Stewardship or BLAAST) we
aim to utilize a novel FDA-approved digital stethoscope with automated lung sound analytics developed and
validated over a period of ten years from evidence across seven LMICs. In Aim 1, we will determine whether
treatment failure frequency among children in rural Bangladesh managed by clinical guidelines enhanced by a
novel automated digital stethoscope is non-inferior to guidelines alone. We hypothesize treatment failure
frequency among `enhanced IMCI' participants will be no worse than standard care by a +/-2% margin, safely
reducing antibiotic use by 50-60%. In Aim 2 we will assess digital auscultation implementation and antibiotic
use during pediatric respiratory care in rural Bangladesh to inform strategies of antibiotic stewardship. Lastly, in
Aim 3 we will evaluate if a diagnostic strategy enhanced by an automated digital stethoscope is a sustainable
alternative to standard care for children in rural Bangladesh. We hypothesize that care augmented by a digital
stethoscope will have additional benefits via reduced antibiotic use that will outweigh digital auscultation costs
resulting in cost-effectiveness compared to current practice.
BLAAST affords a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of clinical guidelines enhanced by an automated
digital stethoscope on child pneumonia outcomes in Bangladesh, if digital auscultation may be instrumental in
the wider antibiotic stewardship strategy, and whether a digital stethoscope diagnostic tool is cost-effective in
the care of children with respiratory illnesses."

This grant application seeks to renew our status as a Core Clinical Center (CCC) and member of the Steering
Committee of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN). The City of Hope (COH)
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) Program has focused its efforts over the last 50 years on the
development of Phase I, II and III clinical trials leading to improvements in HCT for the treatment of hematologic
malignancy and non-malignant disorders. In addition to developing laboratory-based translational research trials,
our program has conducted prospective clinical trials in areas such as reduction of relapse, graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD), and CMV infection. During our 20 years as a member of the BMT CTN, we have participated
in the development of clinical trials focused on important questions confronting HCT patients, several of which
were derived from early phase studies conducted in our program. This proposal summarizes COH CCC
capabilities for BMT CTN, our operational and scientific approaches, and our work in clinical trials both in our
own institution and in collaborations with the BMT CTN. As part of this application, we also propose a concept
for “a Phase 2, platform clinical trial of post-HCT maintenance therapeutics in patients undergoing allogeneic
HCT for treatment of TP53-mutated AML or MDS”. The outcomes of AML/MDS with TP53 mutation is dismal,
and development of effective therapeutic approach is a true unmet need. HCT is the only potentially curative
therapy for high-risk AML/MDS, including those with TP53-mutated diseases, but only a small fraction of patients
receives HCT, primarily due to advanced age, poor performance status, and uncontrolled disease. Even after
HCT, TP53-mutated MDS/AML are associated with low survival rates primarily due to a very high incidence of
relapse. The primary objective of our platform trial is to evaluate the efficacy of different maintenance therapies
for TP53-mutated AML/MDS as measured by 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). The first arm to be tested
will be magrolimab (MAGRO) and azacitidine (AZA). To further improve HCT outcomes in these high-risk
patients, we propose to capture a subset of patients before HCT and incorporate a multidisciplinary team
intervention aimed at detoxifying HCT by recording valid measures of functional recovery and creating a
paradigm for safer application of allogeneic HCT and proceeding to post-HCT maintenance. This trial is based
on the unmet need in the field as recognized at the BMT CTN SOSS 2021 and based on the experience and
expertise at COH investigating MAGRO/AZA as post-HCT maintenance therapy (NCT05823480, PI. Al Malki)
and assessment of frailty/resiliency in HCT candidates with a multidisciplinary approach to optimize care of these
patients at older age or inform clinical condition (NCT04914338, PI. Artz). Moreover, broad collaborations on
correlative science will significantly advance our understanding of this highly challenging disorder and interplay
between multiple immunologic factors involved with the HCT outcomes."

 The ability for transcription factors to achieve specificity in the nucleus is critical for proper gene regulation.
Mis-targeting of protein binding can disrupt an organism's ability to maintain homeostasis and result in disease
states. While sequence-specific transcription factors ostensibly derive their specificity for binding based on
preference to specific DNA patterns (motifs), multiple confounding variables such as epigenetic state, co-factor
binding partners, and chromatin accessibility make the reality far more complicated. This research program
applies a high-throughput (robotic) biochemical genomic approach with machine learning algorithms to identify
the rules and mechanisms that govern the binding of proteins to the genome.
 We have previously developed multiple high-resolution genomic assays (e.g., ChIP-exo, PB-exo, WhIP-exo)
that quantify genome-wide binding of proteins to DNA with varying levels of regulatory features present. We
demonstrated the utility of these assays to understand the native binding preferences of general regulatory
factors in the yeast model organism. The next stage of this research will be to apply these assays on human
transcription factors in ultra-high throughput using a liquid handling robotic system to identify the mechanisms
underlying transcription factor sequence specificity. The first major direction will be to determine the ability of
purified transcription factors to bind naked DNA genome-wide (PB-exo) and to examine how the epigenetic
status of the DNA can change the detected binding of a protein. By using genomic DNA sourced from different
cell states, we will be able to precisely characterize the effect of cell state-specific DNA methylation on protein
binding at base-pair resolution. We will also apply AI/ML algorithms that we have developed to cross-validate
biological discoveries and make new testable hypotheses.
 An orthogonal and complementary approach will apply the WhIP-exo assay to examine transcription factor
binding specificity again on naked DNA, but this time in the context of various cellular extracts. In addition to
uncovering the effects of cell-state specific co-factors on protein binding specificity, we will also incorporate
ChIP-mass spectrometry to identify the co-factors complexing with transcription factors of interest when they
are bound to DNA. These assays will provide downstream testable hypotheses with regards to which protein co-
factors are responsible for modulating binding specificity. The goals of this research program will result in a
detailed understanding of the features responsible for regulating binding in hundreds of transcription factors
along with identities of the protein co-factors that modulate binding."

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndromes (IC/BPS) are a debilitating painful condition with unknown etiology.
The cells and the circuits in the spinal cord that process non-noxious (bladder function) and noxious (intense
bladder pressure or discomfort) sensory information from the bladder is not well established. What specific
roles different spinal anatomical substrates play in processing pathological bladder sensations and voiding
dysfunction is unclear. In this proposal, we will test how distinct spinal cord cells that are activated by cystitis
are necessary for maladaptive micturition and bladder nociception. We will use chemogenetics and
optogenetics approaches to determine the precise roles the cystitis activated spinal cord cells play micturition
and bladder nociception. Furthermore, we will determine how this information is streamed to the distinct brain
regions. Finally, we propose to perform molecular description of genetically classified spinal cell populations
using transcriptomics and fluorescent in situ hybridization. These studies will lead to a cellular and functional
characterization of cystitis activated spinal cord cells and to a better understanding of how different symptoms
of cystitis are regulated in the spinal cord. These efforts will advance our understanding of spinal circuits in
cystitis and may enable development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of IC/BPS."

Virtually fatal 60 years ago, pediatric cancers are now curable for 85% of children who have access to
contemporary treatments and robust supportive care. However, for the 80% of children born in low and middle-
income countries (LMIC), the picture is less promising. When viewed from a global perspective, only 30% of
children in LMIC will survive their diagnosis of cancer, highlighting the stark contrast between high-income
countries (HIC) and LMIC and representing one of the largest disparities in global health.
While curable, cancers in children are not preventable. With no opportunities for prevention, but cost-effective
malignancy-specific treatments increasingly available, an accurate diagnosis often represents the difference
between potential survival and certain death. Modern methods to ascertain a correct diagnosis, such as flow-
cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular genomics, are standard of care in HIC, but unavailable for many LMIC
treatment centers. Transformative diagnostic approaches utilizing cost-effective, scalable technology are
urgently needed.
As genomic sequencing platforms become more accessible and analytical capabilities expand, integrating
sequencing into childhood cancer diagnostics represents an opportunity to overcome the global “pathology gap.”
Classification of pediatric cancers using short-read RNA sequencing is established in research settings, but the
capital and maintenance expenses of this approach are prohibitive for most LMIC. However, nanopore
sequencing platforms require minimal capital investment and limited lab infrastructure, providing an opportunity
for cost-effective, scalable molecular diagnostic technology in pediatric cancer treatment centers.
We propose to establish and validate robust classification models for pediatric leukemias, extracranial solid
tumors, and lymphomas using nanopore sequencing. We will leverage the close partnership between
investigators at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Indus
Hospital and Healthcare Network in Pakistan to optimize technical and analytics methodologies for nanopore
sequencing of challenging samples, specifically formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. We will harden
existing protocols for deployment in LMIC and incorporate our analytic pipeline into integrated nanopore
sequencing and base-calling hardware as a step toward affordable point-of-care cancer diagnostics for end
users. Our objective is to develop and validate a cost-effective, sustainable, adaptable solution for the clinically
relevant diagnosis and core genomic classification for childhood cancers in LMIC using a globally accessible
platform."

There is considerable evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them
across brain regions and modalities to apply operations of the same form, but we lack a theoretical framework
for how such canonical neural circuit computations can support a wide variety of cognitive processes and brain
functions. Through the proposed research, we aim to provide one. Preliminary results demonstrate that a
family of circuit models, called Oscillatory Recurrent Gated Neural Integrator Circuits (ORGaNICs), simulates
many key neurophysiological and cognitive/perceptual phenomena. We propose to develop models of the
dynamics of attention, and working memory, and to test those models with previously published datasets
acquired with a wide range of methodologies: human behavioral data, neurophysiological data from primate
and rodent prefrontal cortex (PFC), electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging data from rodent prefrontal cortex,
and electrophysiology data from rodent medial entorhinal cortex.
In Aim 1, we hypothesize that normalization is critical for the stability and robustness of the recurrent circuits
that underlie working memory. We will test this hypothesis by developing an analytical theory, based on
ORGaNICs, of delay-period activity, and fitting published measurements of response dynamics in PFC.
In Aim 2, we hypothesize that behavioral performance during working memory tasks is limited by trial-to-trial
variability in delay-period activity, and also that top-down signals from working memory circuits provide the
attention-control signals that modulate sensory activity in visual cortex. We will test these hypotheses by
developing an analytical theory of attention and working memory, combining a visual cortex model and a PFC
model, and using it to fit previously published measurements of behavioral performance from a variety of
attention and working-memory experiments.
In Aim 3, we propose to develop and test a theory of manipulation in working memory, with application to
navigation, specifically using ORGaNICs to model the responses of populations of head-direction cells while
animals are performing the active place avoidance task. We hypothesize that head-direction cells in MEC
operate like a working memory representation, by encoding a “landmark” (a sensory feature) relative to the
animal's current head direction, and then updating/manipulating the representation of that landmark as the
animal's orientation changes. We will test key predictions of the theory with new experiments.
The proposed research has the potential to be transformative by: providing a new set of analytical results and
computational (software) tools for characterizing and simulating a broad range of neural circuit models, which
will impact experimental design and data analysis; making new experimentally-testable predictions for both
ORGaNICs and alternative models; and testing some of those predictions with new experiments."
10944437,"Recent data suggest that skin and soft tissue infections may lead to the onset of lymphedema, a debilitating and
incurable disease of lymphatic vessel insufficiency that annually affects 10 million Americans. However,
mechanisms underlying infection-driven impairment of lymphatic vessel function are not completely understood.
The overall goal of the project is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the sustained impairment of
lymphatic vessel contractility and lymph flow. By identifying and understanding these mechanisms, we aim to
develop targeted interventions that can restore fluid balance and boost immune function to aid in the clearance
of primary and recurrent bacterial infections.
Lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) facilitate autonomous lymphatic vessel contraction, but our recent studies and
work from others demonstrate pathological impairment of LMC function. In Aim 1, we will use lineage tracing to
evaluate the regulation of LMCs following bacterial infection. Further, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing to
investigate whether bacteria alter the transcriptional and functional signatures of LMCs. We will also perform
calcium imaging studies to test whether LMCs exposed to bacteria or bacterial virulence factors exhibit impaired
contractility, and whether their function can be improved by existing pharmacological agents. In Aim 2, we will
test whether pharmacological inhibitors of bacterial virulence preserve lymphatic contractility, causing the
expansion of bacteria-specific T cells that protect against subsequent infections.
Through the Boston University Education, Advising and Mentoring in STEM-Medicine (BEAMS) program, we
propose to continue and expand a summer program for historically underrepresented minorities from a Boston
public high school. This program will leverage the resources, infrastructure, and expertise of Boston University
faculty members (Dr. Kelley and Dr. Dominguez) who currently lead initiatives for underrepresented high school
and college students. During their first summer in the program, participants will receive a didactic experience
focused on enhancing their understanding of scientific concepts through comprehensive lectures, problem-
based learning, and laboratory practicums. During their second summer, students will engage in immersive
research projects within Boston University laboratories, under the guidance of investigators who have shown a
strong dedication to mentoring. These experiences are designed to foster scientific literacy and readiness for
college-level science courses. Furthermore, a structured mentoring program is intended to increase the students’
likelihood of attending college and pursuing careers in biomedical research."
10945076,"The heavy burden of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria drove international efforts
to coordinate and integrate tools and programs for mosquito vector control, rapid diagnosis, and drug treatment.
Success has been significant but may be approaching a limiting boundary. The effort to develop a vaccine to
further enhance malaria control has faced many challenges. The advancement of the pre-erythrocytic-stage
RTS,S vaccine is a major accomplishment, providing the foundation for an effort that must continue to improve
efficacy and durability of vaccine-induced protection to further reduce the disease burden. In this regard, the
development of a multivalent vaccine that concurrently targets pre-erythrocytic-stage, blood-stage and sexual
stage parasites is attractive but adds complexity. The immunogenicity of each component must be maintained
while effectively driving both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. We have utilized a recombinant
antigen plus adjuvant approach to systematically formulate an immunogenic, multi-stage, multivalent malaria
vaccine made feasible through the use of an optimized malaria-specific carrier protein, P. falciparum merozoite
surface protein 8. While successful, there are still challenges and limits to this approach considering the breadth
and nature of immune responses that are needed. Several features of the emerging mRNA vaccine technology
are extremely attractive for malaria vaccine development and may overcome challenges inherent to producing
multiantigen, multistage formulations. At the same time, the technology must be evaluated and optimized to
address issues unique to Plasmodium and malaria. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that an
mRNA-based vaccine can be optimized to concurrently drive durable, antibody-mediated and cell-mediated
protective immune responses to pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates. We will optimize
mRNA vaccine-induced, antibody-mediated, and cell-mediated protection to pre-erythrocytic stage parasites
using a novel P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) vaccine candidate. We will design, produce, and
evaluate an mRNA-based vaccine targeting P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRh5) to
drive high titer antibodies that block merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. We will apply data on a highly protective,
Plasmodium yoelii mRNA blood-stage vaccine to the design and testing of a vaccine targeting the 19 kDa C-
terminal domain of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP119). We will evaluate a multivalent mRNA-
based vaccine that concurrently targets sporozoites and liver-stage parasites (PfCSP) as well as blood-stage
merozoites (PfRh5 and PfMSP119). Success in the effort will determine the potential and the limitations of mRNA-
based technology for delivery of a multicomponent malaria vaccine and provide a foundation to integrate
additional targets and/or modifications to advance development of a true multi-stage malaria vaccine."

 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) stands as a formidable neurodegenerative affliction impacting millions globally.
While substantial headway has been made in deciphering the genetic and molecular underpinnings of AD, critical
questions persist regarding transcriptomic responses to hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and TAR DNA-binding
protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, two established features of the disease. Aberrant gene expression
has been linked to both HS and TDP-43 proteinopathy. Different TDP-43 species have been found to have
distinct binding abilities to specific RNA regions and thus selectively influence its RNA-regulatory network. HS is
accompanied by the disruption of the gene regulatory network involved in neuronal apoptosis. However, the
transcriptomic impact of their interplay remains unexplored. Recently, we have characterized a unique
phosphorylation-independent anti-TDP-43 monoclonal antibody specific for a new TDP-43 species in
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-TDP type A and type B. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the
regional and transcriptomic bases of the contribution of the new TDP-43 species and HS to AD. Our central
hypothesis is that the interplay between TDP-43 proteinopathy and HS influences hippocampal transcriptomic
abnormalities. In this study, we propose to combine the strengths of the unique anti-TDP-43 antibody and the
state-of-the-art spatial sequencing developed to investigate the transcriptomic aspects of how novel TDP-43
species contribute to HS in AD. Aim 1 will quantitatively analyze the distributions of TDP-43 proteinopathy (new
TDP-43 species) and neuronal loss in the hippocampi of AD brains. Aim 2 will determine hippocampal gene
expression profiles associated with the new TDP-43 species using spatial sequencing technologies. The
successful execution of this project will significantly advance our understanding of TDP-43 research, particularly
in terms of our limited knowledge concerning pathologic TDP-43 species and its intricate association with HS in
AD."

The overall goal of this project, titled “De Confianza: Creating Medical Trust with Latinx
Communities,” is to increase Medical Trust to lessen HIV prevention and treatment inequities
experienced by Hispanic/Latino Gay, Bisexual and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men

Aim 1. Identify main drivers of medical mistrust and trust among HLMSM.
Aim 2. Adapt or develop an intervention plan by uncovering existing, effective, San Francisco
Bay Area interventions aimed at building trust to improve access to, utilization of, and retention
in HIV prevention and care services.
Aim 3. Implement and evaluate a multilevel intervention to increase medical trust and improve
access to, utilization of, and retention in HIV prevention and care services.
The project will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area, in two priority jurisdictions of Phase I
of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative: San Francisco and Alameda Counties. The San
Francisco Bay Area has a substantial percentage of Hispanic/Latino population and the highest
proportion of gender and sexual minority people in the country.
Our team, including our community partner (AGUILAS), is fully bilingual (Spanish and English)
and bi-cultural, with strong roots in the Bay Area and a solid record of HIV prevention work with
HLMSM communities.
While addressing medical mistrust in the context of HIV prevention and care is a multifactor and
multisectoral effort, this project could have a significant impact given depth of the expertise in
our team and the diversity of the population studied. The findings would inform multi-level
interventions in settings with a significant proportion of Latinx and MSM population."

treatment of Bipolar disorder (BP) and co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs), with prevalence of SUDs
in patients with BP up to 60%. This comorbidity is associated with increased symptom severity, poorer treatment
outcomes, and greater use of costly health services such as psychiatric hospitalization. Significance/Impact:
Veterans who transition from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care are at heightened risk for treatment
nonadherence, mood/substance relapse, deaths due to opioid overdose, and suicide. Nonadherence to
treatment is a significant problem among patients with BP, which is further magnified among those with SUDs.
Nonadherence leads to increased need for psychiatric readmission, with BP patients recently discharged from
inpatient care particularly likely to discontinue pharmacotherapy, relapse to substances, and attempt suicide. Of
particular concern are disproportionately greater rates of suicide in Veterans with BP relative to those with other
mental health conditions. Veterans with BP who use substances, particularly alcohol and opioids, have the
highest suicidality and mortality rates. To date, there is little research on effective and feasible behavioral
aftercare interventions designed to improve treatment adherence in this high-risk, comorbid population at the
critical period following hospital discharge. Innovation: Empirical work suggests that the “Integrated Treatment
Adherence Program” (ITAP) may be an ideal therapeutic approach to improve treatment adherence and clinical
outcomes in Veterans at the critical period of transition to outpatient care following hospitalization. ITAP is an
innovative psychosocial intervention developed by our team designed to improve treatment adherence and
reduce suicidality, bipolar symptoms, and substance abuse among high-risk patients, addressing HSR&D major
research priorities. ITAP combines in-person engagement sessions with follow-up phone contacts and significant
other involvement as an adjunct to treatment as usual over 6 months post-hospitalization. Methodology: The
proposed Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Trial will evaluate the effectiveness of ITAP in a sample
of 140 Veterans with BP-SUD, randomized to receive either the ITAP intervention or a Safety Assessment and
Follow-up Evaluation (SAFE) comparison condition, both delivered as adjuncts to VHA treatment as usual.
Veterans will be recruited from the Providence VAMC inpatient psychiatric unit and assessed at baseline and at
3 (mid-treatment), 6 (post-treatment), and 9-month follow-up. The Primary Aim is to test the hypotheses that
participants randomized to receive ITAP, relative to SAFE, will evidence improved treatment outcomes at post-
treatment, maintained through follow-up. Primary outcomes are: 1) greater treatment adherence defined by (a)
percent missed medications doses/month (based on electronic monitoring) and (b) percent missed VHA mental
health appointments/month. Secondary outcomes are: (2) reduced suicidality and number of psychiatric
hospitalizations/ER visits; and (3) lower depressive and manic symptoms, lower percentage of alcohol and drug
use days, and improved overall psychosocial functioning. The Secondary Aims are to identify the mechanisms
of action targeted by ITAP, moderators of treatment effects, and perceptions of key stakeholders and contextual
factors that may reduce barriers and increase organizational readiness for implementation of ITAP in the VHA.
Next Steps/Implementation: If shown effective and in cooperation with our operational partners, the next steps
for ITAP would be to conduct a Hybrid Type 3 Implementation Trial to test specific implementation strategies
within a multi-site study and to develop an implementation blueprint for ITAP-based standard of care within the
VHA. Determining whether ITAP is an effective adjunctive treatment directly addresses the need for improved
adherence to evidence-based mental health and substance use treatments and the need for effective suicide
prevention interventions in Veterans. Should ITAP prove effective, we will work with our operational partners to
prioritize ITAP’s ultimate dissemination and implementation within VHA."

Myeloid cells are amongst the first responders to pathogenic insults, but there remains a substantial knowledge
gap concerning mechanisms that control their development in the bone marrow (BM). We have found that the
transcription factor ThPOK (T-helper-inducing POZ-Kruppel factor) plays a critical unexpected role in myeloid
lineage differentiation, as ThPOK null mice show expansion of neutrophil progenitors and precursors in the BM,
leading to neutrophilia and protection against sepsis. Loss of ThPOK expression causes widespread
transcriptional reprogramming throughout myelopoiesis. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that ThPOK
serves as a transcriptional checkpoint for neutrophil commitment and granulocyte lineage output in 3
specific aims. Aim 1 will define how growth factor (GF)/cytokine receptor signaling regulates ThPOK
expression in myeloid progenitors. The upstream factors that control ThPOK induction during myelopoiesis
are not known but are likely to include BM-derived GF / cytokine(s), which are known to direct myeloid lineage
choice. Here we will define the signaling cascade/s from GF/cytokine receptor to ThPOK transcriptional cis
element that control ThPOK induction at each specification step. We will use in vitro hematopoietic progenitor
cultures, an existing panel of knock-in mouse models harboring mutations in the ThPOK cis elements to delineate
the upstream pathways that drive ThPOK expression during myelopoiesis. Aim 2 will elucidate the modus
operandi by which ThPOK regulates gene expression during myelopoiesis. The mechanism by which
ThPOK regulates myelopoiesis remain largely unclear. We propose that ThPOK acts in part by recruiting co-
factors to modulate chromatin accessibility, including the NuRD complex. We have generated 3 different ThPOK
and 2 GFI1 mutant mouse models that alter their ability to interact with cofactors or with DNA binding sites. Using
myeloid and granulocyte progenitors from these mutant mice, chromatin accessibility assay, ChIP seq, and
RNAseq we will determine the functional outcomes of ThPOK and GFI1 interaction on myelopoiesis. Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that ThPOK is a critical regulator of infection-induced emergency myelopoiesis.
Emergency myelopoiesis is critical for enhanced release of neutrophils and monocytes from the BM during
infection, but the underlying regulation remains poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest a role for
ThPOK. Using our established ThPOK loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we will examine the functional
consequences of ThPOK-mediated gene regulation on LPS and GCSF-mediated emergency myelopoiesis. This
proposal represents the first study to dissect the role of ThPOK in myeloid development and function, and if
successful will represent an important advance in the field. The proposed studies will ultimately allow
development of novel treatment strategies to reprogram myelopoiesis under different pathological conditions
such as neutropenia, sepsis, and Myeloproliferative Disorder through targeting of ThPOK and its associated
pathways."

Many medications for diverse indications are modified by intestinal bacteria, positioning them as an emerging
and significant driver of overall drug response (efficacy and toxicity) beyond host factors e.g. ethnicity,
genetics, sex, and age. Considering the importance of bacterial drug metabolism during preclinical
development will uncover drug-induced toxicities in relevant tissues, prompting lead retooling, and precluding
adverse events in human trials. My career goal is to develop pharmacomicrobiomics, the emerging study of
drug-microbiota interactions that drive variable drug responses. My research goal is to develop a mechanistic
understanding of how bacterial enzymes mediate toxicity and adverse effects of various drugs in ethnically
diverse populations, and to devise strategies to mitigate, prevent, or treat microbe-mediated drug toxicities in
organs involved in drug disposition. Over the next five years, the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award for
Early Stage Investigators will support my efforts to utilize the bacterial enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a tool
to elucidate mechanisms by which bacterial drug metabolism alters host physiology. GUSs hydrolyze and
reactivate glucuronide-conjugated drugs formed by Phase II metabolism of host UGT enzymes. Deconjugated
aglycones are active and can be toxic to tissues involved in drug disposition, e.g. the intestines. Molecular and
structural features driving GUS' substrate preferences are elucidated, genetic manipulation of many GUS-
encoding bacteria is feasible, and selective GUS inhibitors are in preclinical development. Combining this
foundational postdoctoral work with high-throughput primary cell culture platforms, I propose two interrelated
research programs: Program 1 will test the hypothesis that inclusion of microbiota from diverse populations
will reveal the range of interindividual variability in bacteria reactivation of various drug-glucuronide conjugates.
Program 2 will test the hypothesis that drug disposition-associated tissues derived from diverse ethnic
populations vary in their susceptibility to bacterial drug metabolism. This proposal is the first systematic
analysis of bacterial metabolism of host Phase II conjugates, and their contribution to drug-induced injury in
diverse ethnic populations. This foundational work will facilitate addition of bacterial drug into future physiology-
based pharmacokinetic modeling that can aid in the accurate accurate prediction of drug side effects and
efficacy. The proposed research is significant as it will systematically interrogate the contribution of bacterial
drug metabolism to interindividual variability in drug responses. It will develop phenotypic biomarkers of
bacterial drug reactivation and resultant drug-induced injury, and serve as a primer for future
pharmacomicrobiomic studies. Importantly, this MIRA program will utilize samples from historically under- or
unstudied populations into this emerging and exciting new realm of biomedical research with the goal to
improve precision medicine for all."

The oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model has been a valuable preclinical model for understanding the
pathophysiology of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and ischemic retinopathies in general. Through ex vivo
histologic evaluation of the nonperfusion area (NPA) and neovascularization area (NVA), OIR provides a
quantitative model for evaluating therapeutic interventions that modulate tissue response to ischemic injury and
neovascularization, both of which are common to multiple retinal vascular diseases. Advances in visible-light
OCT (vis-OCT) have recently demonstrated the potential to provide not only in vivo quantitative OCT
angiography (OCTA), but also measurement of total retinal blood flow (TRBF) and oxygen saturation (sO2)
oximetry in preclinical rat models. In this proposal, we will develop a new wide-field (WF) vis-OCT device
optimized for the rat eye to evaluate the relationship between the traditional OIR biomarkers (NPA and NVA) ex
vivo and WF-vis-OCT measured TRBF, arterial and venous sO2, and NPA and NVA. We will accomplish this
through three specific aims. 1) Develop WF-vis-OCT. We will build a new vis-OCT system that can provide 5-
µm transverse resolution over a 130-degree field of view, by integrating a wide-field imaging probe that includes
a custom contact objective lens. 2) Develop deep-learning-aided quantitative OCT angiography and
oximetry. We will develop an end-to-end network for segmenting 2D and 3D capillary vasculature on vis-OCTA,
which will enable the quantification of NPA and NVA in the rat OIR model. The retinal vascular sO2 and TRBF
obtained from the new device will be further validated with an oxygen challenge study on normal rat retinas in
vivo andamicrofluidicchipinvitro.3)EvaluationofratOIRmodelusingWF-vis-OCTbiomarkers.Inacross-
sectional study design, we will first compare vis-OCT biomarkers (TRBF, sO2, NPA, and NVA) with traditional
histological markers in the OIR model (NPA and NVA). We will then longitudinally evaluate two therapeutic
interventions in vivo using the newly established vis-OCT rat OIR model. First, based on the hypothesis that
hypoxia is the driving pathologic mechanism for NV development in phase II of the disease, we will evaluate the
effect of maintaining the rat in a high oxygen environment on TRBF, sO2, NPA, and NVA. Second, based on the
known therapeutic benefit of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) in phase I OIR, we will evaluate
the effect of intravitreal anti-VEGF delivery on vis-OCT biomarkers. If successful, this work will lead to improving
our understanding not only of ROP pathophysiology, but will provide a novel scientific methodology for in vivo
assessment of therapeutic interventions for ischemic retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy, which often use
the OIR model for preclinical investigation."
10944923,"Dementia is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with the most significant impact on those with
young-onset dementia. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common cause of dementia in patients
under 60, and the behavioral variant (bvFTD) is the predominant presenting syndrome. Neuropsychiatric
symptoms (NPS) are core features of bvFTD, and patients with bvFTD require family caregivers to dedicate
significant time and resources to managing NPS. In contrast to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in which the negative
impact of NPS is well understood, prior research has not focused on the nature of NPS and its association with
functional decline in bvFTD. The applicant has identified a discrete affective symptom (AS) cluster
characterized by depression, anxiety, irritability, and agitation that occur in at least 50% of patients and
accelerate functional decline in bvFTD. The treatments developed for the major psychiatric disorders are often
ineffective in bvFTD. Given the high prevalence and disability resulting from AS in bvFTD, there is an urgent
need for more effective and safe treatments to improve both AS and cognition. The long-term goals of this
application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) from a geriatric
psychiatrist are to enhance understanding of the neurobiology of NPS in bvFTD to inform the development of
novel, precision-targeted therapies to slow functional decline, alleviate patient suffering, and ease caregiver
burden. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study to measure glucose metabolism is proposed to
measure changes in neural circuitry with multi-modal antidepressant (Vortioxetine) treatment that targets both
serotonin receptors and serotonin transporters in bvFTD. PET measures of cerebral glucose metabolism to
evaluate neural circuitry is a method that is sensitive to neurodegeneration and AS and cognitive impairment.
The following aims are proposed: I. To identify the neural circuitry associated with AS and cognitive deficits in
bvFTD and II. To identify the changes in neural circuitry following vortioxetine treatment in patients with bvFTD
and AS. The overarching hypothesis is that Vortioxetine will improve AS and executive functioning in bvFTD
and increase cerebral glucose metabolism in the salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN),
respectively. The research plan is complemented by a career development plan to advance skills in 1) clinical
research methodology; 2) the design, application, image and statistical analysis, and interpretation of PET
neuroimaging studies; 3) clinical and research applications of neuropsychological assessments and 4) grant
writing and overall career development. The mentoring team, collaborators and consultants represent senior
faculty with considerable expertise in these areas. Completion of the research and training objectives will
advance the career of a junior investigator toward developing an independent research program focused on
developing PET biomarkers of neuropsychiatric dysfunction in FTD and related dementias including AD to
guide management and treatment selection as the focus of a future RO1 application."

Antiviral systems are critical to the survival of their host. They protect from virally induced morbidity and mortality
across all known domains of life and play an essential role in controlling the endogenized viral elements
contained in genomes, the unchecked expression of which can lead to debilitating autoimmune diseases in
humans and developmental problems in multicellular organisms. Many antiviral systems encode the exquisite
ability to detect and modify or destroy specific nucleic acids, and this has made those components transformative
tools for biotechnology and medicine. The directed discovery of antiviral systems in prokaryotes has exploded
the number of antiviral systems that were known and reshaped how we think about the evolution of antiviral
immune strategies. In eukaryotes, far less discovery research has been done even though there is significant
lack of conservation between the well-studied antiviral systems of humans, plants, and insects with those of
microbial eukaryotes such as amoeba. Not only are microbial eukaryotes the most abundant eukaryote, but they
are also often hosts of the most enigmatic viruses discovered to date, the Megavirales family; giant viruses
whose physical and genome size can rival that of bacteria. The machinery these microbial hosts use to control
viral infection, and how these viruses subvert these responses remains almost entirely unknown. This proposal
aims to address this unanswered question through first understanding how Acanthamoeba spp. defend
themselves against members of the Megavirales family before expanding that understanding (and the tools used
to arrive at it) to other microbial eukaryotes. We will combine principles of the virus-host arms race with cutting-
edge AI-driven protein structure prediction and homology detection to uncover viral proteins that are involved in
antagonizing currently known pathways of viral restriction in Acanthamoeba. We will further use environmental
sampling to establish a collection of viruses and wild amoeba isolates that display a range of susceptibilities to
our giant viruses to identify new systems of restriction within the Acanthamoeba genus. Finally, we will combine
our environmental sampling with discovery-based functional metatranscriptomics to realize the hidden antiviral
capacity of the abundant microbial eukaryotes. Ultimately, these discoveries will lead to the first comprehensive
assessment of non-metazoan antiviral systems that are present in eukaryotes. This will not only dramatically
expand our knowledge and challenge ideas of how eukaryotic antiviral systems evolved, but the results of this
proposal will provide new molecules that can be used to better human life and life quality through their
technological and direct biomedical applications, as have so many antiviral systems before."
10949098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus is a complex disease associated with hyperglycemia. A growing body of epidemiological
evidence supports that patients with comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and breast cancer are at a greater risk of
poor prognosis and death compared with non-diabetic patients. However, the interplay between tumor
progression and diabetes is still mechanistically unclear. Hyperglycemia results in glycation within the tumor
extracellular matrix (ECM), where sugars crosslink collagen through a non-enzymatic reaction resulting in
increased matrix stiffness. Notably, ECM stiffness is correlated with metastatic and promotes malignancy of
tumors through multiple aspects, such as promoting proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
ECM stiffness also regulates endothelial cells, as our lab has shown previously that ECM stiffness promotes
tumor angiogenesis and damages vascular integrity. Malformed and hyper-permeable vasculature is a hallmark
of breast tumors and is known to lead to more metastasis and a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Noting the
carcinogenic effect of glycation and the association between diabetes and tumor progression, my study aims to
understand the mechanism by which diabetic hyperglycemia promotes breast tumor progression via glycation-
mediated matrix stiffening. I have recently established a murine model where hyperglycemia was induced prior
to tumorigenesis. With this model, I find that hyperglycemia increases tumor growth, tumor stiffness, advanced
glycation end-product (AGEs) concentration, and EMT of tumor cells. Upon treating diabetic mice with glycation
inhibitors, I observed a reduction of the previously tested metrics in diabetic tumors to levels comparable with
non-diabetic tumors. These findings describe a novel mechanism by which diabetic hyperglycemia promotes
breast tumor progression and provide evidence that glycation inhibition is a potential adjuvant therapy for diabetic
cancer patients due to its key role of matrix stiffening in both diseases. In the F99 phase of this application, these
findings will be extended by determining the mechanisms by which glycation-mediated ECM stiffening activates
tumor angiogenesis (Aim 1). Noting that glycation stiffens ECM and produces AGEs which initiate cell signaling
through RAGE receptors. AGE-RAGE signaling has been implicated in angiogenic behavior. A particular
emphasis will thus be to tease apart the effect of AGE-RAGE signaling and matrix stiffening on tumor
angiogenesis. Macrophage-involved chronic inflammation is emerging as a link between diabetes and breast
cancer. My preliminary data show that there are more M2 macrophages within stiffer tumors. Thus, in the K00
phase (Aim 2), a research/training environment will be sought to examine the mechanism by how glycation-
mediated ECM stiffening promotes tumor progression via increasing tumor immune cell infiltration and
influencing immune cell behaviors. The ultimate goal of my studies will be to provide a more holistic
understanding of how diabetic hyperglycemia influences tumor progression and to serve as a basis for future
therapeutic intervention."
10949100,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Malignant gliomas are a group of high-grade brain neoplasms that represent the most common form of
malignant brain tumors. Current treatment regimens include an amalgamation of surgical, chemotherapeutic
and radiation treatments yet 5-year survival rates following diagnosis of the most lethal glioma variant,
glioblastoma (GBM) remains stagnant at less than 6%. While new scientific inquiries continue to yield novel
disease-driving mechanisms, survival rates have remained unchanged over the past 30 years, highlighting a
need for new therapeutic approaches for these uniformly fatal diseases.
 Recent scientific investigations have revealed that malignant gliomas form direct synaptic electrochemical
connections with extratumoral neurons to sustain continued proliferation and migration. The study of this
complex interplay between glioma cells and non-tumor neural cells has launched a new line of scientific inquiry
known as cancer neuroscience. Given the existence of these neuroscientific precedents, my predoctoral
research proposes to define how programs responsible for synaptogenesis and synaptic maintenance are
utilized and sustained in malignant glioma. I have identified a novel protein, immunoglobulin superfamily
member 3 (IGSF3), with high expression levels in both in utero neurodevelopment and malignant glioma. My
preliminary data using an in utero electroporation mouse model of glioma have revealed that IGSF3
overexpression drives tumor progression by increasing proliferation and decreasing survival. Furthermore,
overexpression of IGSF3 promotes early-onset seizures in tumor mice and selectively increases excitatory
postsynaptic components at the tumor margin. Based on my initial studies, I hypothesize that increased IGSF3
drives glioma progression by increasing potassium-mediated hyperexcitability that leads secondarily to
synaptic alterations in the surrounding neuronal circuitry. This hyperexcitability then feeds back to the tumor to
promote tumor progression through increased mitogenic and promigratory signaling pathways.
 The results of my predoctoral studies have led me to hypothesize that there is aberrant electrophysiological
activity within tumor cells and that this contributes to disease progression as well. Thus, my postdoctoral
studies will focus on defining and modeling tumor-intrinsic electrophysiological activity in human GBM to
achieve a better understanding of how these networks contribute to disease progression. This research
proposal seeks to summarize previously reported research findings and my preliminary experimental results
that support my hypotheses and rationale, and aims to explain the significance and innovation of my study as
well as the scientific methodologies and techniques I will utilize in order to execute my lines of scientific inquiry."
10947173,"Pregnancy is a maternal balancing act. To guarantee optimal lifetime reproductive success, the
mother must partition her resources between current and future pregnancies. Too little investment
in the current pregnancy compromises fetal survival, while too much investment lowers lifetime
reproductive success by compromising future pregnancies. We hypothesize here that immune
system genes that encode activating and inhibitory allorecognition receptors on myeloid cells set
the optimum by balancing the maternal alloimmune response at the maternal-fetal interface.
Activating receptors limit trophoblast invasion and reduce maternal cost while inhibitory receptors
exert an opposite effect, resulting in an optimal balance. We also hypothesize that disrupting the
balance in either direction (in favor of the mother or in favor of the fetus) increases the risk of
gestational disorders such as preeclampsia. We will focus on allorecognition receptors expressed
on monocytes and macrophages that regulate the alloimmune response to transplanted organs
but have not been previously studied in gestation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypotheses in mice
by investigating the effect of deleting these receptors on the decidual immune landscape,
trophoblast invasion, placental function, and reproductive success, and assess if this results in
preeclampsia-like features. In Aim 2, we will test the hypotheses in humans by investigating the
association between preeclampsia and a maternal-fetal mismatch in the polymorphic gene
encoding one of these receptors that favors maternal myeloid cell activation. Particular attention
will be paid to the likely divergence of the immunopathogenesis of early and late preeclampsia,
which differ dramatically in placental pathology and effects on fetal growth. This grant proposal
brings together transplant immunologists, reproductive biologists, and preeclampsia experts to
execute the proposed aims."
10953423,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adverse birth outcomes, including prematurity and low birthweight, are a persistent public health problem in
the United States. They affect nearly half a million newborns each year and contribute to long-term health
challenges like cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. Risk for adverse birth outcomes is unequally
distributed across the population and disproportionately high in low-income households. Past research suggests
this disparity at birth is at least partially attributable to unequal social and environmental exposures during the
prenatal period, including inequalities in housing stability and affordability.
 Housing insecurity, or limited access to safe, affordable housing, is a common material hardship in low-
income households, forcing many into unstable housing conditions and making health-related needs, like food
and healthcare, more difficult to access and afford.
Pregnancy is an especially vulnerable time for households to
experience housing insecurity given the sensitivity of the mother and the developing fetus to environmental
stress. A growing body of evidence links prenatal experiences of housing insecurity to adverse birth outcomes
 For decades, the flagship policy solution to housing insecurity in the U.S. has been federal housing
assistance. Administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), housing
assistance programs provide stable, affordable housing to nearly 10 million individuals each year, including 5
million families. By reducing exposure to housing insecurity, housing assistance may play a critical role in
reducing risk of adverse birth outcomes. Few studies, however, have investigated the impact of housing
assistance on neonatal health and current estimates of an association with children's health are mixed, with
roughly half of the analyses indicating no association and a quarter indicating negative health impacts.
Many
scholars attribute this inconclusive evidence base to a persistent set of methodological and empirical limitations,
including selection bias, measurement error, effect heterogeneity, and mechanism ambiguity.
To address these research gaps, our proposed study seeks to evaluate the impact of prenatal housing
assistance on risk for adverse birth outcomes using a novel linkage of HUD administrative records for 2002-
2021 with California birth certificate data for 2004-2019. Our specific aims are the following: (1) To estimate the
effect of prenatal housing assistance on birth outcomes, using quasi-experimental methods; (2) To determine if
the effect of housing assistance on birth outcomes varies according to (a) category of assistance or (b) prenatal
timing of assistance; and (3) To explore the role of neighborhood quality and maternal health behavior in
mediating the relationship between prenatal housing assistance and birth outcomes. As government and health
systems increasingly invest in the ""promise"" of affordable housing as preventive care, this project will generate a
unique set of data and insights into the effects of housing assistance on neonatal health in one of the most
demographically diverse and notoriously housing insecure states in the country."

Wildfire activity is increasing resulting in greater numbers of firefighters conducting suppression and prescribed
fire activities each year to protect lives and property. In conducting these activities, individuals are exposed to
occupational factors that increase the risk of acute and chronic illness, including prolonged and elevated
exposure to smoke particulate. Fine smoke particulate is known to penetrate the lung and has recently been
associated with impacts outside the lung including in the reproductive system. In fact, our lab has
demonstrated that laboratory generated wildfire smoke exposure at occupationally relevant levels alters sperm
epigenetic patterns in a mouse model. The National Fire Service Research Agenda Report recently highlighted
the potential for reproductive risk and stated that infertility issues that result from being a firefighter should be a
priority research objective. In response, we have designed three aims to determine the extent to which wildland
firefighter activities, particularly wildfire smoke inhalation, impacts fertility among male wildland firefighters. For
Aim 1, among 100 wildland firefighters, we will assess cross-season paired samples for concentrations of
motile sperm as a marker of fertility and in Aim 2 we will quantify epigenetic modifications in a subset of 50
wildland firefighters as a predictor of quality and offspring health. The outcome of Aims 1 and 2 will be the first
characterization of adverse sperm parameters and molecular changes that occur in wildland firefighters
following occupational exposure to smoke, which will inform early detection and intervention strategies for
occupation-related infertility issues. For Aim 3, we will combine the findings from our study with other current
literature to craft messaging material informing firefighter personnel about the potential adverse exposure
impacts, as well as precautionary measures which may protect their reproductive health. We will seek
feedback via wildland firefighter focus groups (n=20) on how to craft the message as well as what they view as
trusted channels for dissemination. The outcome to Aim 3 will be a strategic communication plan that can be
adopted and modified by the fire service to enhance the reproductive health and wellbeing of male wildland
firefighters."

The goal of this project is to engineer a g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) oxidase suitable for the creation of a high-
performance, implantable, electroenzymatic GABA microsensor. GABA is the most important inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain, yet technology to monitor GABA transients at the cellular level and at the near-
real-time, millisecond time-scale has been slow to emerge, especially for the deep brain. The need is acute,
as glutamate and GABA dominate the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio in the brain, dysregulation of which has
been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, seizures, autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which affect
nearly 25M people in the US. Since GABA itself is not electroactive, a proven approach to creation of a high-
performance sensor entails the immobilization on an electrode of a H2O2-producing oxidase selective for the
analyte of interest. The H2O2 produced by the enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of the analyte is electrooxidized at
the underlying electrode thereby giving rise to a current that may be correlated to the analyte concentration.
However, a GABA oxidase is not commercially available, and other biosensing strategies have significant
drawbacks. Since GABA is ubiquitous in the environment, there is evidence for enzyme activity closely related
to that necessary for sensor development. In fact, an enzyme with native oxidase activity for closely related
methyl-GABA that shows modest activity with GABA has been identified. Our team has cloned and expressed
this enzyme, demonstrated its activity with GABA and constructed a biosensor showing modest ability to sense
the target. Our aims are to employ directed protein evolution to create a highly active and selective GABA
oxidase using advanced ultrahigh throughput techniques and to demonstrate its utility for the construction of a
high-performance GABA microbiosensor. Promising prototype biosensors will be tested as they are created in
the striatum of anesthetized rats. This project will leverage the proven expertise of the team in the areas of
protein engineering; of neuroscience; and of implantable, electroenzymatic microsensor construction to create
technology that will help further illuminate the function of exceedingly important neural circuitry."
10954369,"The United States incarcerates more people per capita than any other developed democracy. Persons behind
bars retain a fundamental, Constitutionally-protected right to receive community-standard healthcare. A multitude
of factors prior to confinement, such as low educational attainment, exposure to violence, housing insecurity,
and history of childhood trauma, likely contribute to the poor health status of the U.S. prison population. As a
consequence of harsh sentencing practices of the 1980s and 90s, 1 in 7 adults in prison is serving a life sentence.
This means our prison population is aging at an unprecedented rate. Incarcerated people face earlier disease
onset and faster progression than community-dwelling, age-matched peers. This translates to an increasingly
frail and medically complex prison population, with high rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia.
When an incarcerated person’s needs exceed the prison’s healthcare capabilities, they transfer to a hospital in
a neighboring community. Yet vanishingly little is known about these encounters. Multimorbidity, high prevalence
of familial estrangement, poor advance directive completion, shackling, correctional officer presence, stigma,
and heterogeneous correctional policies all contribute to these ethically fraught hospitalizations.
The proposed work will address key knowledge gaps about the clinical, geriatric, ethical dimensions of need for
hospitalized incarcerated older adults. Aim 1 will leverage a unique dataset from a 5-state hospital network,
spanning 25 years and thousands of hospital admissions to define prevalence and temporal trends in factors
such as age, delirium and advance directive completion. Aim 2 will apply state-of-the-art qualitative methods to
characterize the experience of hospitalization for an incarcerated older adult from multiple vantage points:
patient, family, correctional officer and bedside nurse. Aim 3 will apply a sophisticated analytic lens to evaluate
prevalence and contents of state and federal policies pertinent to the hospital care of older adults.

10953982,"Neonatal asphyxia is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental morbidities. Hypothermia, the only therapeutic
option indicated for infants with moderate-to-severe asphyxia/hypoxia, does not provide full neurological
recovery. Clearly, seeking new therapeutic interventions to prevent asphyxia-induced complications is crucial.
This proposal is focused on cerebral vascular component of asphyxia in neonates. Cerebral vascular dysfunction
and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption are important components of neonatal brain injury. Endothelial cells and
astrocytes, the intrinsic components of the neurovascular unit, are adversely affected by prolonged asphyxia.
Brain oxidative stress due to glutamate excitotoxicity and inflammation is the major factor in the pathophysiology
of neonatal encephalopathy. This project searches for novel mechanisms that preserve the functional integrity
of the neurovascular unit during prolonged asphyxia in neonates. Preliminary data show that Nox4 NADPH
oxidase is the major source of reactive oxygen species in cerebral endothelium during neonatal asphyxia.
Alternatively, H2S is a gasotransmitter with antioxidant properties enzymatically produced by astrocytes. We
propose the central hypothesis that novel neurovascular cell-directed therapy that combines selectively
blocking Nox4 NADPH oxidase activation with enhancing H2S-based antioxidant defense mechanism
prevents cerebrovascular disease caused by neonatal asphyxia. We will use live newborn pigs, brain tissue,
freshly isolated cortical cerebral vessels and astrocytes, and primary cultures of cerebral endothelial cells and
cortical astrocytes to test three specific hypotheses: 1. Blocking Nox4 NADPH oxidase activity prevents
endothelial dysfunction caused by asphyxia. 2. Enhancing H2S-based endogenous antioxidant mechanism
prevents astrocyte dysfunctions caused by asphyxia. 3. Combination neurovascular-targeted therapy using
Nox4-targeting antioxidants and H2S-elevating agents supplemented by therapeutic hypothermia as a standard
care prevents cerebrovascular disease caused by prolonged neonatal asphyxia.
We will use an exceptional combination of complementary techniques in a translational large animal model of
neonatal cerebrovascular physiology and disease. Our research is unique, as it combines functional and
mechanistic studies in intact cerebral circulation with investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
involved in pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease.
Preventing neonatal cerebral vascular disease translates into prevention of neonatal encephalopathy and
improving health of a new generation. This project may lead to the development of novel translationally relevant
neurovascular-targeting treatments to fully protect the neonatal brain during asphyxia. Importantly, we collected
sufficient preliminary data to support our hypothesis on neurovascular cell-directed combination therapy for
neonatal cerebral vascular disease."
10941388,"ABSTRACT
 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Autism
symptoms in FXS patients typically manifest during early infancy when children actively interact with their
environment and form sensory-cognitive associations. During this stage, the neocortex undergoes extensive
experience-dependent synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning to either maintain or eliminate, so-called transient,
neuronal circuits. Several studies suggest that both sensory and neuromodulatory inputs to the cortex can
establish transient connections with specific cell-types, and subsequently contribute to the maturation of proper
adult cortical circuits. Given that early behavioral therapy is widely considered to be the most effective treatment
for children with autism, pharmacological manipulations of sensory and neuromodulatory transient connectivity
at the early onset of the disorders could potentially mimic or synergize with the effects of such beneficial
behavioral therapies. However, to date, the role and mechanisms of transient connectivity in normal and FXS-
associated cortical maturation remain largely unknown.
 To address this knowledge gap, we propose to investigate the mechanisms of transient connectivity
underlying sensory- and neuromodulatory-dependent cortical maturation in control mice and in a mouse model
of FXS. Sensory experiences are encoded in the cortex by thalamocortical (TC) neurons forming transient
connections with a subset of inhibitory neurons, the somatostatin (SST) cells. These transient connections are
believed to control maturation of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the cortex, which is altered in the mature
brain of FXS mice or patients. Our mouse data indicate that, in parallel to sensory TC inputs, SST neurons
receive cholinergic modulatory inputs associated with the early development of TC pathways. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the synergy between TC and cholinergic transient connectivity to SST neurons is an instructive
mechanism that triggers cortical maturation and that this mechanism is impaired in FXS. Our previous research
using combinatorial mouse genetics and viral chemogenetic approaches showed that metabotropic signaling
controls the formation of transient TC inputs to SST neurons. Based on this data, we propose that cortical E/I
maturation results from metabotropic signaling that transiently transduces sensory cues and neuromodulation
onto SST neurons. To test this hypothesis, we will employ multidisciplinary approaches to investigate whether
transient TC connectivity governs healthy and FXS cortical maturation (Aim 1), elucidate the role of cholinergic
inputs in the maturation of healthy and FXS cortical circuits (Aim 2), and characterize metabotropic molecular
pathways underlying transient connectivity (Aim 3).
 Overall, our work will provide novel insights into the role of transient connectivity on sensory and cognitive
experience-dependent cortical maturation and lay the foundations for exploring approaches targeting the onset
of circuit dysfunctions in FXS."

The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 2050 Agenda for Future Systems envisions that telehealth tools could
make prehospital care safer and more effective, but few EMS systems use video technology. Teleconsultation
with pediatric experts reduces in-hospital errors in children, but whether it prevents prehospital harm—a national
priority—is unknown. To guide EMS systems, we need prehospital trials demonstrating patient safety benefits
for critically ill infants and children, a high risk group for prehospital error. Video use could also help EMS systems
track and measure intervention effects as the most common method, chart review, underestimates safety event
(care could/did cause harm) prevalence and may lack sensitivity to measure changes in care safety and quality
with real-world use. The R01 objective is to test the efficacy of teleconsultation to reduce harm in a controlled
prehospital setting using in situ simulation, an innovative technique to test early stage intervention effects on
clinical processes with real multidisciplinary teams in actual prehospital environments. In prior KL2/K23 awards,
we designed a prototype platform using scalable low-cost technology, validated a simulation model and tool-kit
to study safety events in critical pediatric transports, and demonstrated intervention acceptability and feasibility
in a pilot simulation randomized controlled trial (RCT). Now, we will test intervention efficacy (Aim 1) and compare
safety surveillance methods (Aim 2) to target two critical gaps. In Aim 1, we will test the efficacy of teleconsultation
with pediatric emergency physicians using video (intervention) versus usual care physicians using audio (control)
communication with EMS teams to reduce serious safety events (cause moderate-severe harm/death, primary
outcome) in the simulation model. In Aim 2, we will compare the frequency, type, and reasons for differences in
serious safety event detection (primary outcome) when using video review versus chart review methods. We will
conduct a multicenter, single-blind, parallel-arm, simulation RCT in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied
Research Network (PECARN) and its EMS affiliates to enroll a diverse cohort and leverage EMS collaborations
and research infrastructure for high-quality generalizable results. We will randomize real-world EMS-physician
teams to teleconsultation or control arms. Each team will complete 4 standardized, video-recorded, simulated
transports in real ambulances. EMS providers will document care in a simulated EMS medical record to create
a unique dataset of paired video and chart records. In Aim 1, we will measure between group differences after
blinded raters use video review to score serious safety events on the simulation tool-kit checklist. In Aim 2, raters
will use an EMS chart review tool to identify serious safety events in paired video and chart records using both
review methods in a randomized crossover design. This R01 will generate the first efficacy evidence for
teleconsultation as an innovative prehospital intervention for children by demonstrating reduced harm in high-
risk prehospital settings and illuminating patient safety blind spots in surveillance methods. We will advance the
field by providing the scientific basis for EMS systems to adopt new models of care to achieve EMS 2050 goals."

 Synthetic hydrogel biomaterials hold great potential as cell culture scaffolds, but their complexity falls
short of mimicking the intricacies of biological systems, limiting their clinical efficacy. To overcome this, the goal
of this MIRA application is to develop a versatile, DNA-based synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) mimic that
can be precisely controlled, manipulated, and degraded. This research seeks to not only enhance regenerative
medicine applications but also provide deeper insights into cell biology and ECM interactions. Our hypothesis is
that by harnessing DNA's unique tertiary and quaternary structural properties, we can emulate complex
mechanical features of the ECM in a controllable and orthogonal manner. DNA's distinct role in biology and its
absence in native ECM make it biocompatible and well-suited as a synthetic cell matrix. However, cost and
scalability have limited the use of DNA-based ECM mimics. Fortunately, recent advancements in large-scale
production of cGMP-grade dsDNA for vaccines have made it dramatically more accessible and provide a starting
material ripe for rapid clinical translation. We have already made significant progress in producing high-purity
dsDNA and developing DNA-based hydrogels with ECM-like properties, including non-linear elasticity and
tunable viscoelasticity. These hydrogels exhibit promise in encapsulating cells without cytotoxicity and offer the
potential for controlling tissue-mimetic properties. Our future research program is divided into three thrusts. In
Thrust 1, we aim to develop DNA hydrogels with tunable ECM-mimetic properties and study their interactions
with embedded cells. We will independently explore tuning non-linear elasticity and viscoelasticity, providing
valuable insights into cell behavior under hard to emulate mechanical conditions. Thrust 2 focuses on dynamic
modulation of DNA hydrogel properties, allowing for the controllable actuation of changes in elasticity and
viscoelasticity over time. This approach mimics the dynamic manipulation of ECM during biological processes
such as disease onset or healing and aims to provide a deeper understanding of cell responses to changing
mechanical properties. In Thrust 3, we investigate the expression and release of small proteins and growth
factors directly from the DNA matrix, enhancing nutrient transport and enabling final release from the synthetic
matrix. Overall, this research program aims to demonstrate the broad utility of DNA-based hydrogels as ECM
mimics applications in regenerative medicine and fundamental studies of biophysics. These hydrogels have the
potential to revolutionize other fields, from tissue engineering to drug delivery, biosensing, and beyond."

Protein synthesis is primarily regulated at the initiation stage, allowing rapid and reversible control of gene
expression. Whereas cellular mRNAs require a 5′ cap to initiate translation, many viral mRNAs require an internal
ribosome entry site (IRES). IRESs fold into three-dimensional structures and initiate translation through non-
canonical interactions with cellular translation initiation machinery. Despite decades of research, many important
questions remain unanswered about how IRESs initiate translation, particularly for the structurally complex Type
I and Type II IRESs. Using biochemical studies, we have observed previously unknown IRES RNA structural
changes during translation initiation. We have also leveraged powerful cryo-EM techniques to obtain high-
resolution Type II IRES structures at the final stage of initiation. In the first theme of this proposal, we will build
upon these results and integrate biochemical, chemical, molecular, and structural techniques to determine how
IRES structural dynamics regulate translation initiation of Type I and Type II IRESs. Our long-term goal is to
combine these mechanistic insights with high-throughput RNA structural probing and translation complex
profiling to understand how natural IRES mutations affect structural dynamics, translation efficiency, and
virulence.
 Type I and Type II IRESs are crucial for circular mRNA (circRNA) technology, which has gained interest
as a new mRNA therapeutic platform. Current circRNA design will benefit from incorporating modified
nucleosides, such as pseudouridine (ψ) or N1-methylpseudouridine (m1ψ), that are critical for reducing the
immunogenicity of linear mRNAs. However, ψ/m1ψ modification inactivates Group I introns and Type I/II IRESs—
key RNA elements for circularizing and translating circRNAs, respectively. This result is paradoxical given that
uridine, ψ, and m1ψ are virtually interchangeable in transcription and translation due to their structural similarities.
Our overall hypothesis is that while these modifications maintain and stabilize the Watson-Crick base pairing,
they disrupt certain non-canonical base pairing or tertiary interactions critical for folding large non-coding RNAs.
The goal of the second theme of our research is to solve this paradox and determine how ψ and m1ψ affect RNA
structures and translation. Using the Group I intron and Type II IRES as our model molecular systems, we will
use RNA structural probing, biochemical, and molecular techniques to elucidate how these modified nucleotides
affect RNA tertiary interactions and folding beyond canonical Watson-Crick base pairing. Our results will provide
fundamental knowledge of how base modifications affect RNA folding and function, informing the development
of potent mRNA therapeutics."

 The introduction of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) was portrayed by the tobacco industry, and expected by the public,
to result in an alternative to smoking cigarettes that attenuated or even eliminated their harmful effects.
However, while this may be the case in some circumstances, an increasing body of literature indicates that e-
cig use can cause some of the same (and some additional) adverse cardiovascular toxicity and health effects
as those caused by smoking. This is apparent for both liquid-based e-cigs and heated tobacco products, and in
some cases, involves adverse effects that are not dependent on nicotine itself. Over the past decade, this
research group has conducted a considerable amount of research in humans and animals to determine what
properties of smoking and other inhalational nicotine products accounted for these adverse effects to inform
the FDA about their toxicity. The results from those studies clearly indicate that no single constituent is
responsible for the adverse vascular effects, and that both adverse vascular and cardiac effects result from
exposure to a wide range of these products individually. Conversely, smoking and e-cig use result in distinct
profiles of circulating inflammatory mediators, suggesting that they have overlapping effects via non-
overlapping causes, with e-cig use causing some endothelial problems not caused by smoking. This suggests
that using both cigarettes and e-cigs could result in synergistic adverse effects; i.e., dual use is worse than
exclusive use of either product. This stands in contrast to the common assumption by the general public, and
by the FDA in recent Marketing Granted Orders for e-cigs and heated tobacco products, that dual use would
confer health benefits to smokers. The similarity of physiological effects, despite disparate underlying
mechanisms, supports the need to better understand interacting cardiovascular effects of dual use, such as
cigarettes + e-cigs. The overarching hypothesis is that at least some adverse cardiovascular effects of smoking
and e-cig use stem from distinct underlying causes of harm; therefore, dual use may be worse than exclusive
smoking. In the current landscape of multiple products, dual/poly-use is relatively common; therefore, the
health effects of a tobacco product should be understood in the context of other prevalent inhalational product
use patterns. This project will investigate the cardiovascular effects of dual use on the human, rat, and cellular
levels, focusing on whether dual use increases, decreases, or has the same adverse cardiovascular effects as
exclusive use of either product. These goals will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: (1)
Understand cardiovascular health effects of dual use of a wide range of nicotine delivery products on vascular
and cardiac function in rats. (2) Understand cardiovascular health effects of smoking and e-cig dual use in
humans. (3) Identify patterns of circulating biomarkers specific to exclusive or dual use. This project addresses
the Health Effects and Toxicity FDA Scientific Domains of interest."

Fasting improves organismal health and tissue homeostasis in part by enhancing stem cell activity. In addition,
stem cells serve as a cell-of-origin in multiple cancer types; however, how fasting influences tissue stem cells
remains poorly understood. Here we propose to dissect the role of lysosomes, a dynamic signaling organelle that
orchestrates and executes key aspects of the intestinal stem cell fasting response and tumorigenesis. Lysosomes
control metabolism in response to nutrient availability, and they contribute to protein and cellular homeostasis
through clearance of aggregation in part through its function called autophagy; a critical need in the field is to
uncover the relevant autophagic cargos and metabolites to understand their regulatory roles in cellular and
organismal physiology. Using the mammalian intestine as a paradigm, we aim to understand how lysosomes
maintain intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and contribute to tumorigenesis, as insights into this biological process can
help develop therapies benefiting human health. Here we focus on two largely redundant transcription factors that
are important for lysosomal biogenesis, called TFE3 and TFEB: Our central hypothesis is that TFE3 and TFEB
orchestrate the lysosome fasting response, and they play a central role in coordinating inter-organellar
communication to maintain ISCs under the fasted state by engaging the PPAR driven, mitochondrial fatty acid
oxidation (FAO) pathway. In Aim 1, we will characterize the intestine-specific deletion phenotypes of Tfe3 Tfeb
double mutants in both fed and fasted conditions and further test the necessity and sufficiency of these transcription
factors in driving the ISC fasting response. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism by which lysosomes support
ISCs by employing multiple molecular approaches. First, we will define the transcription network orchestrated by
TFE3 and TFEB. Next, we will isolate lysosomes from ad libitum or fasted ISCs to discover metabolomic and
protein contents. The advance of our approach is the use of a rapid lysosomal purification method (LysoIP) that
we recently adopted to enable cell-type specific metabolomic and proteomic profiling from in vivo tissues in a cell-
type specific manner. Further, we will interrogate the regulatory relationship between TFE3, TFEB and
mitochondrial FAO, a pathway that we previously identified as essential for ISCs maintenance in fasted conditions.
In Aim 3, we will focus on understanding the role of lysosomes in early intestinal tumorigenesis. To this end, the
well-established Apc model of intestinal tumorigenesis and orthotopic transplantation models will be used to ask if
TFE3 and TFEB can impact intestinal tumor initiation or progression. In addition, we will perform LysoIP from
primary tumors to uncover their lysosomal contents. Finally, to investigate whether the lysosomal fasting response
can be synergistically utilized with conventional chemotherapy, we will perform intermittent fasting (IF) on intestinal
adenomas and ask whether established tumors subjected to IF regimen are more sensitized to autophagy
inhibition. Broadly, the proposed research will shed insights into stem cell function, tumorigenesis, and mechanisms
of lysosomal regulation in the physiological context."

Evidence-based approaches to surveillance mammography for older breast cancer survivors do not exist. Data
suggest a life expectancy of ~10 years is necessary for early detection to translate into a small survival benefit.
Conversely, the harms of mammography persist and are immediate, including false positives, overdiagnosis,
and related over-treatment. Currently, mammography use in survivors is high, even when life expectancy is
limited. As part of a National Cancer Institute (NCI) R21, the “Are Mammograms Still Right for Me?” shared
decision making (SDM) toolkit was developed to support SDM between clinicians and older women around
when to discontinue surveillance mammography. The SDM toolkit is designed for any survivorship setting and
contains clinician-facing expert-consensus guidelines, talking points, and a companion patient guide on the
benefits and harms of surveillance mammography. What remains lacking and critically needed is evidence as
to the effectiveness of the SDM toolkit in decreasing mammography use in those who are more likely to experi-
ence harm than benefit. The long-term goal is to accelerate the development and implementation of breast
cancer survivorship guidelines tailored to individuals. The overall objective for this application is to determine
the effects of the SDM toolkit on mammography use, decision quality, and mammography knowledge in breast
cancer survivors aged ≥80, an age where median life expectancy is <10 years. The central hypothesis is that
the toolkit will lead to more appropriate utilization of testing while improving knowledge and the decisional pro-
cess. The following three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the effect of the SDM toolkit on mammogra-
phy use and clinical outcomes; 2) Determine the toolkit’s effects on mammography knowledge and on SDM
between patients and clinicians; and 3) Evaluate the facilitators and barriers to implementation of the SDM
toolkit and discontinuation of mammography in this setting using the Consolidated Framework for Implementa-
tion Research (CFIR). To evaluate the efficacy of the SDM toolkit, a randomized controlled trial will be con-
ducted that randomizes 52 clinicians and 312 older breast cancer survivors from 6 U.S. cancer centers to the
(a) SDM toolkit intervention or (b) Usual Care over three years. The proposed research is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on determining the effectiveness and po-
tential broad implementation of a novel, promising state-of-the-art SDM toolkit. The proposed research is sig-
nificant because the results of this pragmatic trial are expected to provide strong justification for broad clinical
deployment of an effective evidence-based SDM toolkit for proper use of surveillance mammography for older
breast cancer survivors. Ultimately, the results of this research continuum are expected to have a positive im-
pact on the quality of follow-up care for the >50,000 women age ≥80 diagnosed with breast cancer annually in
the U.S. and the growing population of older breast cancer survivors."

This Career Development Award (K08) establishes health state utilities across several established and evolving
therapies for low-risk, sub-centimeter thyroid cancer (papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, PTMC). While survival
for PTMC is favorable, its treatment can incur substantial morbidity and societal costs. Acceptable treatments
include active surveillance, partial or total thyroidectomy, and radiofrequency ablation. Due to the disease's
excellent prognosis, it is unlikely that these treatments would yield meaningful differences in survival, however
post-treatment experiences are different. Thus, treatment value is largely driven by patients' perceptions and
preferences regarding the treatment experience. This value may be estimated through stated-preference
instruments that define the utility of pre-defined health states. Thus far, there is little data on health state utilities
in PTMC, and it is unclear whether patients, clinicians, or the general population are the most suitable participants
for studies that estimate utility. The candidate will address these knowledge gaps by estimating the utilities of a
series of PTMC clinical vignettes using a time trade-off preference-based instrument. These utilities will then be
incorporated into a Markov cost-effectiveness model comparing surgical and non-surgical options. Specifically,
the candidate will test the following hypotheses: 1) average utility for the active surveillance health state is non-
inferior to that of partial thyroidectomy, 2) treatment complications significantly reduce utility, 3) general
population respondents significantly underestimate thyroid cancer utilities relative to experienced patients and
healthcare workers, and 4) active surveillance is more cost-effective for the management of PTMC than surgery
or radiofrequency ablation. The long-term objective of this research is to establish preference-based health state
utilities that can be used in health economics research to optimize resource allocation in thyroid cancer. Following
a clinical fellowship in surgical oncology, the candidate was appointed Assistant Professor of surgery at the
University of Maryland Baltimore. He has since partnered with scientific mentor C. Daniel Mullins, PhD, to engage
with patient and physician stakeholders in health services research. This K08 is designed to transition to research
independence through graduate level training in survey design, patient-centered outcomes, biostatistics, and
health policy. Additional professional courses will address research career development and health technology
assessment. The application draws upon resources through the school of medicine's department of surgery and
the school of pharmacy. With the advanced training afforded by the K08, the candidate will be positioned to
submit a competitive R01 application."

The long-term goal of the proposed research is gain fundamental insights into the process of tooth generation
and loss using the innovative leopard gecko model. The gecko is the first biomedical research model where there
is direct access to the replacing dentition in an adult animal. Our first theme is tooth eruption. There are very few
animals in which we can study tooth eruption which is key for creating a functioning dentition. There is a poor
understanding of what drives teeth to move upwards to the oral cavity. We propose pioneering experiments
based in part on dental techniques and innovative developmental biology methods. Our experiments will test
whether teeth gain traction from attaching to dental epithelium, whether softening of the matrix above the teeth
helps to move teeth upwards. This work is fundamental to our understanding of human defects in tooth eruption,
particularly teeth that become buried in the jaw and are difficult to treat. The second theme is tooth resorption.
The gecko repeatedly loses teeth but not randomly. Instead there is timed tooth shedding that involves
odontoclasts, a cell type that is rarely studied. The unwanted activity of odontoclasts in humans causes roots to
resorb ultimately leading to premature tooth loss. The rationale for choosing the leopard gecko is as follows: 1)
the gecko discoveries are likely to be applicable to human tooth replacement due to shared evolutionary history,
2) adult geckos have large numbers of teeth that are replaced throughout life, 3) gecko teeth are only attached
to bone on the cheek side, leaving the other side accessible to experimental manipulation, 4) the tooth
replacement cycle is much shorter than other adult reptiles so a change is visible sooner, 5) gecko teeth are
regularly invaded by odontoclasts providing us with an opportunity to study odontoclast behaviour during a
normal, physiological process 6) the Richman lab initiated studies on gecko tooth replacement. We have proven
that after tooth removal that the teeth will regrow. The gecko offers unique access to the developing adult
dentition compared to mouse, fish and shark models. The ability to continually monitor the effects of dental
surgery on tooth regeneration or to odontoclast recruitment in living animals is not possible in other models. We
have included advanced mathematical analysis and modelling to determine the most important locations of cells
and signals needed to start and slow down tooth shedding. The synergistic research environment consists of the
PI who is a pediatric dentist and a developmental biologist, a mathematician specializing in mathematical biology,
an experienced technician who supports all molecular work, a bioinformatition who has worked on the gecko
genome with our lab and a new postdoc. The team is poised to make significant discoveries that can be
translated to treatments for failure of eruption and tooth loss in humans as well as other diseases such as
osteoporosis and osteoarthritis."

My research group strives to gain detailed information about cellular nanoscale structures, dynamics, and
molecular mechanisms by designing and applying innovative and versatile single-molecule imaging tools,
labeling schemes, and analysis algorithms. The goal of our research is to improve our understanding of cellular
function and pathogenesis by answering biophysical questions related to normal function, laminopathies,
ciliopathies, cancers, and other diseases. One of our primary research interests and long-term goals is
understanding the mammalian cell nucleus, including its related and anchored proteins, its chromatin
organization and dynamics, and how they relate to gene regulation in healthy cells and during disease
progression. In this proposal, we will build upon our expertise in fluorescence single-molecule tracking and super-
resolution imaging, engineered point spread functions (PSFs) for 3D detection of single molecules with tens of
nanometer precision, light sheet illumination for reduced out-of-focus background fluorescence, photobleaching,
and photodamage during whole live-cell imaging, our recently developed dCas9-based nanobody array labeling
approaches for long-term tracking of chromatin dynamics with excellent spatiotemporal resolution, and our
recently developed light sheet-compatible microfluidic system for precise control of the extracellular environment.
We will implement and expand these innovations to address a range of biophysical questions related to molecular
mechanisms behind cellular function in healthy cells and during disease progression, including how the dynamics
of chromatin organization affect gene expression and what the molecular mechanisms are that underlie the
premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). To achieve our goals, we will pursue
the following main thrusts: (1) develop and implement approaches for labeling and live-cell 3D tracking of specific
chromosomal loci pairs, such as enhancer-promoter (EP) pairs, and gene expression during adjustable
extracellular conditions. These measurements will yield novel data with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution
on enhancer and promoter dynamics, EP separation, contact frequency, and contact duration, and establish how
these parameters relate to transcriptional output. This will enable us to uncover fundamental physical
mechanisms of gene regulation and will set the stage for future research on interaction kinetics of various
regulatory elements implicated in chromatin reorganization and gene regulation. (2) Define the molecular
interactions of the mutated protein progerin in HGPS and map how its nanoscale spatial distribution and
interactions with other proteins and with chromatin are affected by treatment with available and novel therapies.
This thrust will be of great significance for human health by evaluating the molecular mechanisms of
pathogenesis and treatment strategies for HGPS and the results may have wide-ranging medical implications
also for other laminopathies. Our versatile methods are generalizable and enable future research on molecular
mechanisms in a wide range of biological systems and diseases, including other laminopathies."
10939550,"Type IV pili (TFP) are captivating bacterial nanomachines that are broadly conserved and exhibit a diverse array
of physiological functions. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) for example, TFP are
implied in numerous virulence associated factors such as biofilm formation, mechanosensing, and motility. The
physiological function of TFP relies on repetitive cycles of extending and retracting of a short polymeric fiber into
the extracellular space, for example to adhere to a substrate and pull the cell forward. These dynamic cycles are
facilitated by a complex molecular machinery consisting of dozens of different proteins that work together in a
concerted manner. Although the constituents of TFP are known, the intricate molecular processes governing
their interaction and how these interactions enable the physiological function of TFP remain largely elusive.
Current limitations of observing the molecular interactions that drive the functions of TFP are intrinsic to the
experimental techniques that have been used to far: these techniques cannot resolve individual proteins or TFP
complexes. Single molecule techniques have the potential to fill this gap and to gain invaluable insight into the
interactions among the proteins of the TFP system and how they function together as multi-molecular complexes.
The power of single molecule studies is to resolve and observe individual TFP complexes, their constituents,
and to probe the rapid interactions between TFP and their effector molecules, which happens on the ten to
hundreds of milliseconds timescale. The long-term vision of my research program is to leverage the potential
that single molecule light-microscopy based techniques offer to understand TFP and their physiological function
at the molecular level: we will reveal how TFP machines are assembled molecule-by-molecule, how individual
molecular motors and regulatory proteins interact with the static components of TFP, and how these interaction
kinetics are changed and trigger downstream signaling pathways during the physiological function of TFP.
Specifically, firstly, we will use super-resolution microscopy to resolve individual TFP complexes and their
components and map their precise locations and assembly states molecule-by-molecule. Combined with
timelapse fluorescence microscopy to track the formation of new TFP components through the cell cycle, this
will reveal the first step to the physiological function of TFP: when, where, and how the different components of
new TFP are assembled and controlled. Secondly, we will use single-molecule Forster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) to investigate the dynamic interactions between specific pairs of proteins of the TFP system.
This will reveal how molecular effectors enable and tune TFP dynamics to regulate the physiological functions
of TFP. Long term, we will couple these experiments with single-molecule force microscopy techniques to reveal
how the physiological functions of TFP feed back to the molecular dynamics of its constituents.
The impact of this program extends beyond Pseudomonas' TFP and encompasses the broader TFP superfamily,
including secretion, adhesion, and flagellar systems in gram-positive and -negative prokaryotes, and archaea."

 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, in collaboration with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, collects data annually on women who have
recently given birth through the Colorado Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(PRAMS). Data collected in PRAMS include maternal characteristics and behaviors, pregnancy
risk factors, and birth outcomes. These data are generalizable to all live births in Colorado
because they are based on a probability sample and statistically weighted. PRAMS is an
ongoing, population-based surveillance system designed to supplement birth certificate data
and to generate state-specific perinatal health data. Each month, a stratified random sample
comprised of approximately 2.5 percent of Colorado women who recently had a baby are
selected from eligible birth certificates. The sample is stratified by region of residence (Denver
Metro, Other Metro, Rural) to ensure an adequate sample in the rural areas of the state.
Selected women are asked to complete the PRAMS questionnaire by mail or over the
telephone. The questionnaire addresses a variety of health and psychosocial issues such as
prenatal and postpartum care, maternal use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana, breastfeeding,
stress, mental health, infant health, and more. Respondents who complete the questionnaire
receive a $20 gift card for participating and are protected under a human subjects research
designation.
 PRAMS has gained importance and visibility over the years because it is a key source for
Colorado-specific, population-based data on the prevalence of many health indicators such as
unintended pregnancy, receipt of prenatal and postpartum care, breastfeeding initiation and
duration, contraceptive use, perinatal substance use, and infant health among women delivering
a live birth. These data can be used to identify groups of women and infants at high risk for
health problems, to monitor changes in the health status of pregnant and postpartum women,
and to measure progress towards goals in improving the health of mothers and infants. PRAMS
data are used by state and local Maternal and Child Health programs to plan and evaluate
programs and policies aimed at improving the health of mothers and infants."

Decades of research have strongly linked disruptions in the serotonin (5HT) system to mental health disorders
such as depression, and social and communication difficulties. Despite this link a gap remains in understanding
the etiologies of many of these disorders. Beyond its role in neurotransmission, 5HT is a critical morphogenic
signal during neurodevelopment, with known roles in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, and in
programmed cell death. We have recently determined that a maternal high saturated-fat diet (mHFD) throughout
pregnancy in mice causes bacterial endotoxin accumulation in fetal placenta and brain, driving a central immune
response and leading to sex-specific behavioral abnormalities in offspring. Measurement of 5HT levels in mHFD
offspring revealed a male-specific decrease in fetal brain that persisted into adulthood. Maternal dietary
intervention with tryptophan (the precursor to 5HT) rescued normal brain 5HT levels and behavior only in mHFD
males. Microglia colonize the developing dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) where 5HT cell bodies are localized
starting as early as embryonic day (E)10 and thus are likely to shape this brain region as it develops. Strikingly,
in male offspring only, we found that mHFD increased microglial phagocytosis of 5HT neurons in the E14.5 DRN,
whereas either restoring normal 5HT levels via tryptophan supplementation of the dam's diet or conditional
knockout (cKO) of the innate immune receptor toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) in microglia prevents this overeating
response in male microglia and restores normal behavior. These data point to microglia as a critical effector cell
between maternal inflammatory signals and subsequent neural development. Our goal is to determine the
mechanisms by which microglia target 5HT cells for removal in males but not females in mHFD conditions, and
to determine if maternal diet alters specific DRN circuits in males vs females underlying the different behavioral
abnormalities."

PRMT5 is an essential enzyme and the cell’s primary enzyme capable of symmetric dimethylation of arginine
residues. PRMT5 is a therapeutic target in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. PRMT5 methylation of
multiple protein substrates regulates a host of important cellular pathways and processes including transcription,
chromatin dynamics, mRNA splicing, and translation. While PRMT5 activity is required for cell and tissue survival,
which function(s) or substrate(s) of PRMT5 are required for general cell maintenance or involved in cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases has not been elucidated. Further, while PRMT5 substrate proteins are strongly
enriched for RNA binding and RNA regulatory pathways, the biochemical effects of arginine dimethylation have
not been resolved. Specifically, methyl-Arg increases the size, hydrophobicity, and charge distribution, and
decreases the H-bonding potential of substrate arginines but the mechanics of how the Arg-methyl groups affect
PRMT5 substrates’ structure/function and subsequent cell survival are not known. In this project, I will explore
how PRMT5 methylation of substrate proteins affect their ability to (1) bind to mRNA, (2) bind to other
proteins/form higher order protein complexes and (3) affect substrate-dependent processes such as mRNA
splicing. We will identify how substrates are recruited for methylation by PRMTs and what the downstream
biochemical function is in order to better understand PRMT5 essential functions in normal cells and disease.
Achieving a therapeutic window where select PRMT5 activities can be blocked without disrupting normal cell
function is critical for targeting this essential enzyme. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of PRMT5 biology
has the potential to inform our understanding of an important posttranslational modification on multiple
intracellular targets and to guide future efforts in developing modulators of PRMT activity in disease settings.
The discovery of novel sites on PRMT5 or on substrates may provide new therapeutic targets that would allow
for targeting select PRMT5 function in disease while preserving the normal healthy cells and overcoming issues
of toxicity observed with broad, catalytic PRMT5 inhibitors. We have previously defined the first mechanism of
substrate recruitment to PRMT5 through the conserved, colinear PRMT5 binding motif using a computational
tool to discover enriched protein motifs. We have predicted a new binding site for several additional PRMT5
substrates including ZNF326 – a substrate that is consistently methylated in all cells tested and that regulates
mRNA splicing. We will determine how substrates get recruited to PRMT5 (and other PRMT family enzymes) for
methylation and their cellular and biochemical outcomes as we establish a comprehensive research program
devoted to understanding how enzymes select their substrates and performing early validation of their
therapeutic potential. Overall, this project will dissect the cellular consequence of substrate arginine methylation
by PRMT5 and from this we can uncover how therapeutic PRMT5 inhibitors will affect disease and normal tissue."

With a fast pace of population aging, the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer’s
disease is expected to rise exponentially, placing an enormous social and economic burden worldwide.
Epidemiologic and pathological studies have indicated an association between vascular diseases and cognitive
dysfunction, implicating vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, the
driving pathologic mechanisms of VCID remain unclear, preventing the development of effective prevention and
treatments. In response to the NIH Notice of Special Interest (NOT-HL-23-002): Promoting research to
understand VCID, this proposal aims to identify the mechanisms of cognitive impairment caused by
atherosclerosis and red blood cell (RBC) released ATP using both animal models and human samples.
Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of vascular disease worldwide, yet the role of atherosclerosis in cognitive
impairment and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Our study using high fat diet (HFD)-fed
ApoE-/- mice showed that atherosclerotic plaques extensively blocked carotid and intracranial arteries, resulting
in brain hypoperfusion, cerebrovascular remodeling and neuroinflammation. Importantly, cognitive behavior tests
detected significant memory deficits in ApoE-/- mice as early as 12 weeks with HFD, but not in age matched mice
with normal diet, demonstrating a causal relationship between atherosclerosis and cognitive impairment. Our
study also showed that disturbed blood flow-triggered ATP release from RBCs via pannexin 1 channel (Panx1)
contributes significantly to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis as well as cognitive impairment.
Specifically, Panx1 deletion from RBCs led to reductions of plaque formation and alleviations of the cognitive
deficit in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice. Additionally, we showed that hypercholesterolemia enhances vascular
endothelial cell (EC) [Ca2+]i responses to ATP, a key signaling for EC barrier dysfunction. These findings led to
our central hypothesis that atherosclerosis-induced brain hypoperfusion and vascular inflammation via
hypercholesterolemia along with RBC-released ATP are the key risk factors of atherosclerosis-driven cognitive
impairment. Three specific hypotheses will be tested experimentally in vivo, in vitro, and computationally in silico
under three specific aims. Aim 1: The atherosclerotic blockage of carotid and intracranial arteries causes brain
hypoperfusion and cerebrovascular remodeling, resulting in cognitive impairment. Aim 2: RBC-released ATP
contributes significantly to atherosclerosis-induced cerebrovascular pathology as well as the onset and
progression of cognitive impairment. Aim 3: Hypercholesterolemia and hemodynamic alteration-induced RBC
released ATP are the key risk factors synergistically contribute to atherosclerosis induced cerebrovascular
inflammation and EC barrier dysfunction in mice and humans. The new knowledge gained from this study will
advance our understanding of the risk factors and mechanistic insight into atherosclerosis-induced VCID and
hence promote early treatment and lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive decline."

Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) for CNS cancers leads to debilitating cognitive decline that is particularly concerning
for pediatric and grade II/III brain cancer survivors. CRT triggers inflammation and astrogliosis, leading to
cognitive dysfunction. Astrocytes control the availability of adenosine (ADO), a neuroprotectant and modulator
of cognition, via adenosine kinase (ADK), which gets elevated post-CRT. ADO exerts neuroprotection by
activation of adenosine receptors (A1R) that play important roles in synaptic plasticity and cognition. ADK, by
controlling synaptic ADO levels and A1R activation, fine-tunes the sleep-wake cycle which is dysregulated
following CRT. Sleep-wake disruption and cognitive impairments are among the most common symptoms in
brain cancer patients undergoing CRT, but mechanisms underlying its occurrence are not fully understood. The
circadian clock is centrally mediated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and functions at the cellular level
via an intricate transcription-translation feedback loop consisting of the transcription factors, Aryl
ReceptorNuclear Translocator Like (ARNTL, also known asBMAL1) and Circadian

Locomotor Output Cycles
Kaput (CLOCK) proteins. Though the role of these proteins in cancer is complex, we have shown that BMAL1
suppresses the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via interacting with tumor suppressor genes. Using the
mouse model of CRT and astrocytoma, our preliminary observations indicate that: i) BMAL1 binds to target sites
in the Adk gene in a circadian manner and, ii) CRT reduces BMAL1 in the normal and cancer-bearing mouse
SCN. We hypothesize that CRT disrupts BMAL1-mediated sleep regulation in both normal and cancerous tissue,
in a cell type-specific (astrocytes) and ADK-dependent manner. Using a genetic approach, astrocyte selective,
double knockout of Clock and Bmal1 in vitro and in vivo, this application will determine the impact of BMAL1 and
CLOCK on the Adk gene and brain region-specific expression of circadian proteins in mice brains with or without
astrocytoma receiving cranial radiotherapy. This study will reveal key mechanistic information regarding
sleep/wake (dys)regulation following CRT for brain cancers."
10952309,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Postoperative opioid prescription is an important contributor to the opioid epidemic,
affecting ~4% of >50 million Americans undergoing surgery each year. The dose and duration of treatment with
opioids in surgical patients is an established risk factor of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths.
Although legislation and guidelines are developed to limit opioids prescribed following surgery in the US, in
2020, opioid overdose deaths increased by 39% with worsening mental health. Mood disorders, including
anxiety and depression, are risk factors for increased postoperative opioid use. Thus, innovative and effective
techniques to minimize the perioperative opioid use are critical in the fight of the opioid epidemic.
Cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) has been proven to decrease acute and chronic pain as well as opioid
use among surgical patients. Recently, digital applications of CBI, the dCBI, is getting traction among
practitioners and patients due to ease of access via smartphones and 24/7 availability. The dCBI along with
telemedicine-based therapy coaches to treat anxiety among patients with inflammatory bowel disease proved
success. The availability of telemedicine-delivered digital CBI is a potential groundbreaking non-
pharmacological approach to limit opioid use among surgical patients. Our proposed work is also responsive
to NOT-DA-20-058 “Utilizing Telemedicine or Other Remote-Based Platforms to Develop and Support
Treatments for Substance Use Disorders.” Our pilot data using dCBI in conjunction with telemedicine among
moderately anxious and depressed patients scheduled for total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) is
supportive that dCBI was effective in reducing preoperative anxiety with a trend of decreased opioid use
postoperatively. Our central hypothesis is that the preoperative telemedicine-delivered dCBI will decrease
perioperative anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing in THA/TKA patients. Preoperative dCBI will
reduce severe postoperative pain, overall reduce opioid use, opioid-related complications, chronic persistent
surgical pain, and persistent opioid use at 3 months after surgery. Anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing
increase postoperative pain and opioid requirement by up to 50% and since dCBI reduces mood disorder
symptoms, we also hypothesized that using dCBI will also reduce anxiety, depression, catastrophizing and that
could represent a mechanism for decreased postoperative opioid requirements. Our team is well positioned to
perform this project and will 1) quantify opioid sparing properties of dCBI i n T H A / T K A u s i n g a
randomized, blinded clinical trial, 2) evaluate effects of reducing preoperative depression, anxiety and
catastrophizing, and 3) determine the effects of dose/time relationship of the preoperative dCBI on opioid
consumption. This research will improve surgical pain relief, safety of postoperative opioids while minimizing
opioid use, dependence, and risk of OUD in millions of Americans who have painful surgeries each year,
while increasing broad reach and dissemination potential via telemedicine technologies."

Human experience is shaped by our senses, which receive diverse inputs from our
environment. These varied inputs, however, all contribute to a single integrated
representation in our minds of the outside world. Neuroscientists have studied sensory
perception, and the integration different sensory modalities like vision, hearing, and
touch, for decades, but there are still important unanswered questions about how
sensory cells in the brain work, and how the circuits that they form control the flow of
information through the brain. Understanding these networks in detail would expand our
knowledge of the brain in general, and would serve as a starting point for addressing
disorders like autism spectrum disorder, in which sensory systems function abnormally.
In a large part, these functioning sensory circuits have remained mysterious for technical
reasons. Traditional techniques either sample from the whole brain without seeing the
individual neurons or record from a few neurons at a time without seeing the larger
networks. This project addresses this gap using the zebrafish model system by imaging
activity across the entire brain, including the activity of each neuron individually. The first
aim contains a plan to map such brain-wide activity while the brain perceives and
processes visual or auditory information, using a set of novel approaches for sensory
stimulation. Experiments in the second aim will present various visual and auditory
stimuli simultaneously, looking for the ways in which the brain's functioning networks
integrate this information. These data will be used to build mathematical network models
of how the brain processes and integrates vision and hearing. The third aim will shed
light on functional and structural aspects of these sensory neurons, revealing biological
realities that we will use to adjust the purely mathematical models from the prior aims.
The resulting biologically grounded models will set the stage for concrete functional
experiments in the fourth aim, where we will optogenetically activate or silence specific
circuit elements to test the models' predictions.
The overall goal is to describe, for the first time, all of the auditory and visual neurons in
the brain, and to develop and test models for how they receive, process, and integrate
information across sensory modalities."
10952148,"Over five million persons in the United States are living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(referred to as “persons with dementia” or PWD). Most patients with early to moderate disease reside in the
community and require significant help from family caregivers. Community dwelling PWD and their family
caregivers represent a burgeoning and vulnerable population with significant unmet medical and psychosocial
needs, one of which is pain management. Pain in PWD is common and compounds the impact of dementia,
causing distress, discomfort, increased disability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Treatment for pain often
focuses primarily on pharmacotherapy which has significant limitations for older adults. Pain in PWD also
causes increased stress for family caregivers who are themselves at risk for adverse mental and physical
health outcomes. To date, the overwhelming majority of literature on pain management in PWD focuses on
patients with advanced disease living in long term care facilities. Given the prevalence of pain in community
dwelling PWD and the impact of pain on patients and caregivers, it is important to target pain management
efforts to both patients and caregivers together. Pain coping skills training (PCST), a non-pharmacological pain
management approach based on cognitive behavioral principles, has been found to be efficacious among older
adults without dementia. A caregiver-assisted PCST protocol adapted to meet the needs of PWD and their
caregivers represents a novel approach to pain management in this population that holds the promise of
decreasing patient pain, disability, and psychological distress, and caregiver burden. This NIH Stage 1A study
aims to refine a caregiver-assisted PCST intervention and develop study procedures in preparation for a well-
powered Stage 2 randomized clinical trial. Aims of the proposed study are: (1) To refine the caregiver-assisted
PCST intervention specifically for patients with mild-moderate dementia and determine the optimal duration
(e.g., number of sessions, session length) and mode of treatment delivery (e.g., in-person vs. remote) with
input from Community and Professional Advisory Boards and through conducting a single-arm pilot study with
30 patient-caregiver dyads. (2) To identify optimal recruitment and retention strategies with input from our
Community and Professional Advisory Boards. We will pilot and refine these strategies in the process of
piloting the intervention. Ultimately, this program of research has the potential to meaningfully advance the
clinical care of PWD and pain and enhance their quality of life and that of their family caregivers."
10951778,"Project Summary
Numerous observations both in humans and in experimental animals support the notion that acetylcholine (ACh)
is important for learning and memory. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms through which ACh’s
biochemical control over the excitability of cortical cells reorganizes cortical dynamics and mediate learning and
learning related plasticity, or other cognitive functions, remain poorly understood. This application takes
advantage of technological advances in the last decade that facilitate exploring how cortical neurons are
modulated under physiological circumstances of ACh release, as well as determine the contribution of these
modulations to the physiology of cortical neurons and networks during behavior. We have implemented a simple
associative learning task that has been shown to depend on changes in cortical circuitry in the whisker
representation area of the primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) and is well suited to investigating the cellular
and circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes associative learning. We have obtained preliminary evidence
that acquisition of the association of the conditioned stimulus and a reward requires ACh release in wS1. The
goal of this exploratory R21 grant is to demonstrate feasibility of several experimental strategies to study the
cellular and circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes learning in the task we have implemented and to begin
testing hypotheses about cholinergic mechanisms responsible for the behavior. For these goals, we propose two
Aims. In Aim 1, we investigate the requirement of ACh during different phases of the associative learning task.
In Aim 1A, we use 2-photon microscopy with a genetically-encoded fluorescent ACh sensor to investigate the
magnitude and time course of ACh release in wS1 during the acquisition and consolidation of the associative
learning and during performance of the task after the association has been learned. In Aim 1B we develop a
chemogenetics strategy for the transient suppression of cholinergic activity in wS1 during specific phases of the
associative learning. In Aim 2 we begin to develop a pharmaco-genetic strategy using cell-specific genetic
ablation of specific cholinergic receptors in different types of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons to
begin to discover cholinergic actions that are important for associative learning in our task. These experiments
will help develop a framework for understanding how dysfunction in ACh signaling results in neurocognitive
disorders associated with the cholinergic system, and provide insights into potential cell-type specific
interventions."
10954082,"SUMMARY
 RAS signaling has been implicated in a wide spectrum of processes central to normal development and
disease. Human mutations in RASA1 (a GAP negative regulator of RAS) are associated with capillary
malformation-arteriovenous malformations (CM-AVM). These comprise a group of non-cancerous vascular
lesions characterized by hyperproliferative endothelial cells that form abnormal and fragile blood vessels. CM-
AVMs are underdiagnosed, but when identified in the clinic are often responsible for seizures, internal
hemorrhage, and/or stroke.
 Germline mutations affecting one RASA1 allele alone are insufficient to give rise to vascular anomalies. For
pathologic malformations to arise, additional somatic mutations are necessary. Open questions in the field
include: 1) What are the secondary hits that trigger malformations in the context of RASA1 haploinsufficiency
and, 2) How do the additional altered genes collaborate with RASA1 mutations to facilitate the emergence of
abnormal vessels? Answers to these questions are needed to develop pharmacological interventions and to
develop strategies to restore vascular homeostasis. Here we will use novel mouse models that reproduce AVMs
in several organs to study the biological consequences of RASA1 loss. Preliminary experiments revealed that
RASA1 is a critical regulator of endothelial cell-cell junctions and vascular integrity. In addition, we found that
RASA1-haploinsufficiency in mice provides a sensitized genetic platform that can be used to interrogate the
effect of potential second-hit targets. Genetic combinatorial effects can be tested, followed, and studied in a
highly tractable murine ear assay. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RASA1
haploinsufficiency alters junctional complexes, and sensitizes endothelial cells to the emergence of vascular
malformations. Two aims were developed to test this hypothesis: (1) To identify partners that synergize with
RASA1 haploinsufficiency to promote the emergence of vascular malformations and, (2) To elucidate molecular
targets that act downstream of RASA1 to promote junctional complex integrity and resist emergence of vascular
anomalies. Mechanistic experiments will be performed with human cells and several mouse models. In addition,
we will extend validation to human lesions through retrospective analysis of donor tissue. Clarifying the
contribution of RASA1 to vascular homeostasis could offer an unprecedented opportunity for intervention by
identifying the key players in this debilitating condition. In addition, understanding cooperating genes will
improve screening protocols and benefit patients harboring RASA1 mutations who live with an elevated lifetime
risk of complications from AVMs. The proposed studies will be directly applicable to the clinical setting of RAS-
related malformations, as they will broaden our understanding of the disease and potentially aid in stratifying
patients toward specific management paradigms."
10954086,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of combustible cigarette tobacco use remains high among socioeconomically disadvantaged
Americans despite declines in the broader population. Socioeconomic inequities in tobacco use rates and
tobacco cessation success have grown over recent decades. Disadvantaged adults who use tobacco are
therefore a high-priority population, but we have made too little progress in engaging this population in
evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment. Community agencies that provide support services to
disadvantaged individuals have the potential to reach people who use tobacco and engage them in high-quality
cessation treatment to prevent cancer. The Salvation Army is a community agency with national and
international reach and a commitment to discouraging tobacco use and promoting the health and wellbeing of
the diverse communities they serve. The Salvation Army will partner in the proposed project to refine and
evaluate implementation strategies designed to help their staff connect their clients with free evidence-based
tobacco treatment from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line. Salvation Army social service leaders, staff, and
clients will help to refine and adapt quitline referral implementation strategies with promising preliminary data to
enhance their fit and sustainability in the usual context of Salvation Army services. Pragmatic research
methods will be used to evaluate two promising implementation strategies designed to promote quitline
referrals: 1) a low-intensity, sustained collaborative approach to implementation support for Salvation Army
staff (vs. a usual care approach offering initial training with minimal technical support), and 2) modest,
immediate incentives for clients to connect with the quitline (vs. no incentive). Both the collaborative sustained
implementation support for staff and client incentives will be refined in the 2-year UG3 phase, along with
pragmatic study measures and procedures. In the UH3 phase, the target implementation strategies refined in
the pilot phase will then be evaluated in a pragmatic randomized rollout trial in which 8 sites are randomized to
sustained collaborative implementation support for staff and 8 sites are randomized to usual implementation
training for staff, and all 16 sites will start without client incentives for immediate quitline connections, and will
then introduce incentives at randomly assigned timepoints, as in a stepped-wedge design. Inclusion criteria for
sites, staff, and clients will be minimal to enhance external validity, and data on the primary outcome (whether
or not a referral occurred) will be gathered from Salvation Army service records and quitline records in the
course of usual care. This will be supplemented by mixed method assessments conducted by researchers that
will not affect the context of intervention implementation. This pragmatic program of research has the potential
to identify staff- and client-focused strategies that can enhance Salvation Army efforts to support tobacco
cessation among their clients. Leaders at the Salvation Army are committed to helping their clients quit
tobacco, and to applying the lessons learned in the proposed project more broadly in the region and nation."

Rigidity is an important property of molecules that increases the likelihood of their success as drugs. Our goal
with support of this MIRA grant is to develop reactions that enable molecular rigidification. We describe a
research program that enables access to rigid small and medium sized-strained rings. Our innovative approach
to obtaining rigid molecules is to use sulfone anions as carbene surrogates. We will also develop new methods
to stabilize highly reactive alkylidene units using palladium catalysis. The knowledge gained from these studies
using reactive carbenes will also be used to enable skeletal editing of heterocycles. We will apply the reactions
developed in this proposal to synthesize complex natural products and their derivatives with tubulin binding
properties and antifungal properties."
10941620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Soluble and bound factors play a pivotal role in cell signaling, adhesion, and function to promote
wound angiogenesis and healing. Depending on the content of how these ligands are presented,
they will elicit differential signaling effects. While soluble pro-angiogenic factors initiate angiogenic
responses, bound ligands modulate the duration, intensity, and specificity of these effects.
Together, they coordinate vascular formation and maturation, ensuring efficient wound healing
while avoiding abnormal blood vessel growth and tissue fibrosis. However, developing an
integrated bioengineering system that recapitulates the complex physiological microenvironment
of wound healing with intricate balance and dynamic interactions between soluble and bound
factors, remains challenging. This proposal seeks to establish an integrated bioengineering
framework, harnessing the potential of advanced biomaterials design, innovative chemical
processes, and state-of-art fabrication techniques to present the combination of both soluble and
bound factors to better understand how these synergized dynamic physiochemical properties
govern cell signaling and modulate cell function, with a focus on chronic wound angiogenesis and
healing. To achieve this goal, we aim to apply chemical routes to delineate negative charge
attributes in synthetic heparin-mimetic hydrogels, and subsequently employ liquid-liquid phase
separation techniques to introduce microspheres into these pro-angiogenic materials, culminating
an in vitro microfluidic wound-on-a-chip model and diabetic mouse model to investigate the
cooperative effects of soluble and bound factors in cell signaling. The working hypothesis points
that combining the pro-angiogenic growth factor signaling (soluble gradient) and integrin-
mediated mechanotransduction (bound factors) in phase separated 3D synthetic matrices -
characterized with tunable charge densities and increased microstructures - will enhance cell-cell
and cell-ECM interactions that promote cell migration, infiltration, connection, ECM deposition,
and vascular network formation to induce wound angiogenesis and healing. The integration of
tunable biomaterials with a novel in vitro 3D wound injury and closure model builds a bottom-up
biomimetic system to explore the synergistic effects between soluble biochemical signals and
bound biophysical cues with the minimum components required for enhanced wound
angiogenesis and healing. This comprehensive in vitro platform of a 3D multicellular culturing
system will identify the key matrix properties for wound healing and such insights are paramount
in leading the therapeutic advancements for wound angiogenesis and chronic healing."
10941623,"Abstract:
Wound healing after injury is accomplished by the coordinated action of several cell types that migrate to the
injury region and participate in tissue repair. Interactions between invading cells and the surrounding microen-
vironment are critical for the healing outcome. Current in vitro studies focus on comparing cell behavior in con-
ditions mimicking healthy tissue or fully fibrosed scar and mostly ignore the complex and dynamic properties of
the provisional matrix that plays a critical role in instructing cell processes during wound healing. The goal of
my research program is to develop cell-instructive biomaterials to support endogenous tissue repair after criti-
cal injury. My lab is at the forefront of designing injectable and microporous granular hydrogels with tunable
properties to support endogenous cell infiltration and tissue repair. While this approach presents intriguing pos-
sibilities for clinical translation, progress is severely hindered by a lack of knowledge on how endogenous cells
process the complex biophysical and biochemical properties of the provisional wound matrix and the implanted
hydrogels. A major aspect of our lab’s approach is the creation of in vitro platforms to model cellular interac-
tions, which serve the dual purpose of improving fundamental understanding of cell behavior in wound-mimick-
ing environments and rationalizing biomaterials design to elicit specific cellular behaviors. Over the next five
years, our lab will develop or advance in vitro models of endothelial sprouting, mesenchymal stromal cell para-
crine signaling, and fibroblast-driven matrix deposition, using synthetically designed modular hydrogels with
tunable porosity, ligand density, mechanics, and degradability. These hydrogel platforms will enable us to ad-
dress questions not easily answerable with traditional 2D coatings on plastic substrates or naturally derived
materials such as Matrigel that cannot be modified to recapitulate wound properties. Outcomes of projects in
these thematic areas will ultimately serve our overarching goal of leveraging the fundamental understanding of
cellular processes to design therapeutic biomaterials for effective wound healing in diverse tissue and organ
systems. Projects across all three themes have the potential to present several intriguing questions that can be
addressed with new hypotheses, experimental designs, and increasingly sophisticated biomaterial platforms
over the course of this funding period and beyond, making this proposal a perfect fit for the Maximizing Investi-
gators Research Award mechanism."

Annual mass azithromycin distribution dramatically reduces the prevalence strains of Chlamydia trachomatis
that lead to blindness. Current World Health Organization guidelines indicate that annual mass azithromycin
distribution should be continued until district-level prevalence of the clinical sign of trachoma, trachomatous
inflammation-follicular (TF), drops below 5%. However, TF doesn’t correlate well with true prevalence and there
is no gold standard to detect this. Here, we propose that a Hidden Markov Model 1) will identify the true
prevalence in hypo-endemic areas that can be used as a signal that the mass azithromycin protocol was
successful and an indicator to stop antibiotics and 2) identify hyperendemic areas that the protocol has not been
successful to change the treatment regimen. We anticipate that results will provide evidence to support altering
the modification of current interventions for trachoma."
10945667,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 70% of preterm births are preceded by preterm labor, which is primarily associated with non-
infectious etiologies. However, little is known about the non-acute-inflammatory causes of preterm birth. This
project builds on extensive published and preliminary data indicating that T cells and the cytokine IL-9 at the
maternal-fetal interface play an important role in preterm labor and birth. The overall goals of this project are to
define the mechanisms by which the cytokine IL-9 at the maternal-fetal interface promotes preterm birth and
negative consequences for offspring, to determine the mechanisms by which vitamin D can prevent these
outcomes, and to identify new T cell subtypes that contribute to preterm labor in humans. Aim 1 is to elucidate
the mechanisms by which IL-9 promotes preterm labor and birth. This aim tests the hypothesis that IL-9 targets
both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells at the maternal-fetal interface in mice. Aim 1 will also explore
whether IL-9 signaling is required within the maternal or fetal tissues to promote preterm birth. Additionally, the
mechanisms whereby vitamin D prevents IL-9-induced preterm birth in mice will be determined. Aim 2 is to
define the impact on offspring of IL-9 at the maternal-fetal interface. This aim tests the hypothesis that maternal
IL-9 that enters the amniotic cavity causes adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Specifically, this aim will
examine the fetal lung, intestine, and placenta and neonatal airway and gut immunity. Additionally, the extent
to which prenatal vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the impact of in utero IL-9 exposure will be
investigated. A hypothesis-generating Aim 3 will identify T-cell subsets at the maternal-fetal interface in women
with preterm labor and birth. This project will make use of an advanced mouse model of IL-9-induced preterm
birth, imaging mass cytometry, spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing of human placenta samples
from term and preterm pregnancies, and functional testing on T cells isolated from patients with term or
preterm birth. The innovative fusion of immunology and omics approaches used here will unveil non-infectious
causes of preterm labor and birth and may lead to development of a treatment – such as vitamin D, which is
FDA-approved during pregnancy – to reduce the risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the new immune targets
identified could lead to development of novel strategies to reduce preterm birth and its sequelae. This project is
directly relevant to the call for research “exploring the contribution of immune dysregulation to gestational
disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes” to improve reproductive health."
10946927,"During chemotherapy, 34% of breast cancer survivors (BCS) experience cancer treatment-related cognitive
impairment (CRCI). CRCI degrades memory and executive function as well as quality of life. As the number of
BCS is expected to increase by one million by 2030, there will also be an increase in the prevalence of CRCI.
One understudied risk factor is diet, with an underlying mechanism being the gut microbiota. Post-treatment,
increased fruit, vegetable, and fat consumption protects against CRCI in BCS. However, neither this relationship
nor the underlying mechanisms, such as the gut microbiome, has been investigated during treatment, when
CRCI begins. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (Med Diet) has been shown to improve memory and to increase
levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a gut bacterium associated with better cognitive scores in non-cancer
populations. In BCS undergoing chemotherapy, this bacterium is linked with neurological toxicity. A Med Diet
during treatment may therefore reduce CRCI incidence or severity via the gut microbiome. The objective of this
study is to determine if diet is related to CRCI in BCS and if the gut microbiome is a mechanistic link. My central
hypothesis is that higher adherence to components of a Med Diet, e.g., fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated fats,
and fiber, will be related to higher scores on neuropsychological tests administered during chemotherapy, and
that the gut microbiome will mediate this relationship. The aims of this study are as follows. Aim 1: Determine
the relationship between components of a Med Diet, gut microbiome, and cognitive function in 30 BCS before,
during, and after adjuvant chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. Aim 2: Develop a Med Diet intervention for
BCS by conducting semi-structured interviews among BCS who have recently completed treatment to
understand their views and attitudes toward a Med Diet. Aim 3: Conduct a 12-week Med Diet pilot feeding study
among 30 BCS undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. To complete these aims, I need an interdisciplinary
mentoring team to train me in 1) conducting research in cancer patients, 2) designing a controlled feeding trial,
3) qualitative data collection and analysis, and 4) advanced analysis of complex dietary, neuropsychological,
and gut microbial datasets. Through training with this mentoring team and through the coursework and stellar
facilities offered by my institution, I will complete the K99 phase of this proposal and thus (1) understand the
relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and cognition during breast cancer treatment, (2) understand
BCS tastes and preferences of a Med Diet during treatment, (3) provide preliminary data for the submission of
two R01 grant submissions; and (4) prepare me to lead a feeding trial during the R00 phase of the award to
understand how the gut microbiome can be manipulated through a Med Diet to reduce CRCI. This K99/R00 will
allow me to become an independent investigator leading gut microbiome-focused, patient-informed dietary trials
to reduce CRCI’s negative impact."
10947106,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Suicide accounted for >48,000 deaths in the United States (US) in 2021. The annual rate has increased by
>34% in the last 20 years. Suicide prevention is a top NIMH research priority. Evidence suggests that suicide
attempts (fatal and non-fatal) are preventable, and health systems are an optimal location to implement
prevention approaches. Research conducted by the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) and others
demonstrates that there are effective tools for suicide risk screening, risk assessment, safety planning and
follow-up care and the workflows and resources needed for implementation are feasible. In the US, these
approaches have been introduced in healthcare systems as part of a suicide prevention care pathway called
the Zero Suicide (ZS) Model. Now an international movement, the ZS Model has been introduced in >20
countries worldwide and 100s of health systems in the US. As health systems continue to implement the ZS
Model, it is necessary to develop adequate quality measures to facilitate rapid cycle quality improvement and
benchmarking with the goal to improve suicide prevention care and reduce suicide. While initial quality
measures have been developed by national accreditation and quality organizations, there remain opportunities
for significant improvement. This study fills these major gaps through a series of three Specific Aims, including
1) To develop and test a set of suicide ideation and attempt (fatal and non-fatal) outcome measures, 2) To
develop and test suicide care process measures to determine their impact on outcomes, including measures
for suicide risk screening, risk assessment, safety planning, and specialty follow up care, and 3) To
disseminate and optimize these measures via consensus meetings with the National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA), The Joint Commission (TJC), other professional organizations, and patient and health
system stakeholders. This study leverages electronic health record and insurance claims data from 3 large
geographically and demographically diverse health systems affiliated with the MHRN located in Washington,
Colorado, and Michigan. It also builds upon initial metrics developed through completed work evaluating ZS
Model Implementation across these participating health systems. In total, these systems serve more than 2
million unique patients per year aged 10 years and older across clinical settings. Available data include suicide
attempt and death records, patient reported suicide screening, clinical suicide risk assessment, safety plans,
diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and encounter types from 2016 through 2023. These data will be used to
develop and test a range of quality measures aligned with the aims in partnership with stakeholders from
NCQA and TJC to support rapid dissemination and adoption."
10972754,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This is a new submission for an R61/R33 award for Dr. Aparna Sundaram (Assistant Professor,
Department of Medicine) and Dr. Hyunil Jo (Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry) at
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The long-term objectives of this proposal are to develop
novel small molecule inhibitors of integrin α2β1 to disrupt force transmission in airway smooth muscle in
chronic airways diseases such as asthma.
 Recent data published by Drs. Sundaram and Jo have shown that targeting proteins involved in smooth
muscle tethering can impair force transmission in asthma models. Inhibition of these proteins result in
protection against the exaggerated contraction induced by asthmagenic cytokines such as IL-13 ex vivo, or
airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic airways disease models in vivo. Drs. Sundaram and Jo have shown
that these protective effects occur independently of changes in intracellular actin-myosin crossbridging by
directly modulating the tethering of smooth muscle to the surrounding matrix, suggesting that they can be
combined with currently available bronchodilators acting on smooth muscle to further enhance relaxation.
 In this proposal Drs. Sundaram and Jo present preliminary data underscoring the importance of the
smooth muscle tethering protein, integrin α2β1; ligation of this integrin results in protection against IL-13
enhanced contraction ex vivo and airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. They have further shown proof of
principle with the parent compound c15, and have made significant improvements in potency with A2-85, and
even further optimization for oral delivery with compounds identified in this proposal. The R61 phase of this
proposal seeks to synthesize and screen potent and specific small molecule inhibitors of integrin α2β1 with a
structure-based-drug-design approach (Aim 1). Compounds will be further narrowed with in vitro optimization
and ex vivo validation (Aim 2). Finally, hit compounds will be selected based on
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to optimize oral delivery and in vivo testing in relevant disease
models (Aim 3). The R33 phase of this proposal will further focus on lead series optimization. This proposal
combines the efforts of two scientists with expertise in smooth muscle biology and de novo drug design who
have already successfully collaborated together on the design and development of novel integrin inhibitors,
along with a seasoned team of collaborators and consultants with experience in pre-clinical drug development.
Accordingly, the R61 phase of this proposal aims to provide a lead series and the subsequent R33 phase will
further focus on selection of a developmental candidate for therapeutic use in poorly controlled asthma."
10972812,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The dynamic regulation of chromatin is critical for proper gene expression, and dysregulation leads to diseases
including cancer and metabolic disorders. The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is formed by
a histone protein core around which DNA wraps. The unstructured histone termini, referred to as histone tails,
protrude from this core and are key players in chromatin regulation. Incorporation of histone post-translational
modifications (PTMs, chemical or protein modification of histone residues) and histone variants (histones with
distinct sequences that substitute for canonical histones) are two major mechanisms of chromatin regulation,
and they act in part through the histone tails. Despite great strides being made in understanding the chromatin
landscape, large gaps remain in our knowledge of chromatin structure, gene regulation, and the histone
language. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to define the chromatin landscape (the complex molecular
interactions within and between nucleosomes along with their genetic and epigenetic factors) that underlies gene
expression so that dysregulation that causes human disease can be corrected. The objective is to develop a
molecular-level understanding of the conformation and dynamics of the histone tails within the nucleosome along
with their bridging interactions (altogether, the histone tail landscape) and how these translate to the level of
chromatin structure and accessibility. This includes determining how histone tail landscapes are perturbed by
histone post-translational modifications and histone variants and how these landscapes are interconnected with
each other and those of other nucleosome components. In this five-year MIRA proposal, the focus will be on: 1)
determining how lysine acylations differentially regulate the histone tail landscape to contribute to metabolically-
linked differential gene regulation, and 2) the variant-specific role of the centromeric H3 variant in regulating
chromatin structure during mitosis and chromosome stability. A pairing of solution NMR spectroscopy with other
biophysical approaches and phase separation studies, as proposed here, is essential to decipher this highly
dynamic and heterogeneous system. Understanding the structural and dynamic effects of histone PTMs and
variants on regulatory control of gene expression and chromatin structure will lead to a significant enhancement
in our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and epigenetically-linked diseases."
10811715,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART). Proof of HIV latency in human CNS is currently lacking, despite continued high prevalence of HIV-
associated neurologic disease and increasing recognition of CNS viral escape in people stably suppressed
with cART. One of the major issues regarding CNS HIV in need for study is HIV integration. With other words,
whether CNS HIV integration has biologically significant impact, contributing to pathogenesis? Issues of CNS
functional deficit are further complicated by the co-registered epidemic of opiate and other substance use
disorders (SUD) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), as SUD also have profound impact on CNS function,
and potentially on HIV latency. Nowhere in the CNS is this more evident than in the neuroanatomic overlap of
HIV and SUD in striatonigral dopaminergic circuitry and frontostriatal projections, sites of predilection for
functional and neurobiologic disease as well as for increased burden of HIV infection. Accordingly, directly
utilizing brain tissues in these regions, from neurologically well-characterized HIV-infected individuals with and
without SUD, the goal of this application will be: (i) to replicate for brain some of the emerging genomic
mechanisms recently discovered in peripheral cells, linking HIV host genome integration and virus latency to
nuclear topography and open chromatin; (ii) to explore whether HIV signatures in transcriptomes and
epigenomes in dopaminergic circuitry is associated with prospectively monitored neurological status in the
years before death and exposure to drug of abuse; (iii) explore HIV expression and integration in potential
reservoir cells of the brain, including microglia and astrocytes derived from HIV+ brain at autopsy and (iv)
explore the impact of substance history on HIV integration and activity in primary microglial cultures derived
from HIV- brains at autopsy and (vi) expose primary microglia in culture to drugs of abuse and HIV. The
innovative experiments proposed here are expected to offer novel insights into epigenomic landscapes in
specific brain cells and explore potential links between neurogenomic status of the infected brain and
neurological and cognitive symptoms and substance abuse. While recognizing the high-risk aspects, these
analyses will nevertheless have predictable, high gain benefits in understanding the complex neurobiology
underlying HIV-associated CNS disease in PLWHA and SUD."
10875364,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dental fear affects over 53 million American adults. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, it leads to
“needless pain and suffering, causing devastating complications to an individual's wellbeing, with financial and
social costs that significantly diminish quality of life and burden American society.” Standard treatment —
compassionate but ultimately counterproductive — includes anti-anxiety medication or more substantial anes-
thesia, which (a) does nothing to reduce subsequent anxiety or avoidance, (b) leads to continued dental prob-
lems, and (c) perpetuates the cycle of fear—>avoidance—>dental problems. Alternatively, cognitive-behavioral
treatments (CBT) for dental fear have been developed, subjected to dozens of high-quality trials, and found to
be efficacious. However, CBT has, almost exclusively, been offered only in a few specialty clinics worldwide as-
sociated with universities and there is no disseminable model for integrating CBT into the workflow of dental
practices. To fill this gap, we have created a stepped-care approach to dental fear treatment that can be
implemented in private practice dental offices throughout the U.S. and is eminently scalable. Stepped-care in-
volves starting with the least intensive option and progressing to more intensive options only when necessary.
At the low end is a self-administered intervention: (a) a smartphone “app” that can be used privately in waiting
rooms by an unlimited number of patients combined with (b) a paper-and-pencil “Pre-Game Plan” in which the
patient records — to be reviewed with the dental staff prior to dental services — (1) pre-treatment fear levels,
(2) the factor generating the most anxiety, (3) a stop-signal the patient will use to alert the dentist,(4) things
the dental team can do to maximize this patient's comfort, and (5) a self-generated anxiety management plan.
If patients are not in the “low fear” zone following their dental procedures, they may receive 1-hour (if still in
moderate zone) or 2-hours (if still in severe zone) of dental fear CBT in their dentists' offices conducted by a
collaborating mental health provider. In the first phase of this study, we will pilot test the approach with fearful
patients (N»35,700) at two University dental centers. In the second phase, we will test the it in private dental
practices (n = 100 volunteers from a pool of 10,000 practicing dentists in the metropolitan areas of Philadel-
phia and New York [and the corridor between them] who graduated from dental school from either New York
University or the University of Pennsylvania). The aims are to study factors influencing patients' and dentists'
willingness to try stepped-care, to test the efficacy of the approach, to test the dosing of CBT interventions de-
pending on patients' fear levels, and to test whether the way in which we believe CBT works (i.e., by helping
patients disconfirm their beliefs regarding feared outcomes) is truly the active ingredient. Finally, we
will develop dissemination materials for dentists and mental health providers on “How to Effectively Treat
Dental Fear with a Stepped-Care Approach.”"

This project's primary endpoint focus will be efficiently rescuing toxic cyanide exposure using three distinct animal
models. None of the current countermeasure options meet the requirements for the risk scenarios and objectives
in PAR 22-209. There are continual threats of chemical exposure to human populations. Health and safety
measures in the workplace cannot fully mitigate the chances of unexpected or malicious use of chemical
toxicants. Safe and effective countermeasures to a cyanide chemical exposures that can deploy in a variety of
challenging emergency settings represent a continual unmet medical need. In addition to survival, mitigating the
sequel morbidities of toxic chemical exposures means another challenge for next-generation countermeasures.
For metabolic poisons that reach high levels of exposure like cyanide, approaches to reverse the insult's effects
are warranted to mitigate more prolonged-term effects. A team of investigators with experience in discovering
and developing countermeasures and therapeutic agents and expertise in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology,
toxicology, discovery pharmaceutics, in vivo phenotypic screens, and complimentary animal models will pursue
milestones established from 3 specific aims. Aim 1: To improve and down-select next-generation platinum (II)-
based countermeasure agents hydrogen cyanide scavengers with properties that meet the criteria for
developability. Aim 2: To evaluate combinations of the metabolite glyoxylate with platinum (II)-based scavenger
agents. Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy and safety in a porcine model for cyanide intoxication of lead candidate
platinum (II)-based agents alone and in combinations with the metabolite glyoxylate."

Children with obesity are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature death.
Black and Latinx children are more likely than their white peers to experience overweight or obesity, in large
part due to exposure to stressors and adverse experiences resulting from poverty, racism, and other social
determinants concentrated in historically disinvested neighborhoods. Predictable and nurturing parenting helps
buffer children from the damaging impact of early life stress and supports self-regulation and healthy behaviors
which contribute to healthy development. The onslaught of daily stressors in historically disinvested
neighborhoods, however, inevitably affects parents’ well-being and capacity to provide predictable and
nurturing care. Parenting-focused interventions which provide meaningful social connection and support in the
context of the tremendous challenges that families face, can effectively promote predictable and nurturing
parenting as well as child self-regulation, mental health, and academic outcomes in the context of adversity.
Rigorous studies of several parenting programs find additional benefits for children’s physical health,
suggesting that universal access to parenting-focused interventions may be key to achieving population-level
obesity prevention among Black and Latinx children living in stressful environments. Despite the potential of
early childhood parenting-focused interventions to prevent obesity among Black and Latinx children from
historically disinvested neighborhoods, the population-level impact remains unknown. We propose to study the
population-level impact on obesity in pre-adolescence from an evidence-based parenting-focused intervention
offered to all families of pre-Kindergarten (pre-K) students in high-poverty schools. The current proposal
leverages a large cRCT with 3,300 children (~75% Black and Latinx) to study intervention impact on BMI
trajectories from age 7 – 10 years. Using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, this study considers
pre-intervention child characteristics and neighborhood environment as potential moderators to identify factors
that may support or hinder prevention effectiveness at the level of the population. Aim 1 is to evaluate
preventive intervention impact on obesity (BMI) trajectories in pre-adolescence (at four time points at ages 7, 8,
9 and 10) and examine moderation by pre-intervention child self-regulation, race/ethnicity, and gender. Aim 2
is to identify neighborhood-level variation in intervention impact on BMI trajectories based on multiple
indicators of residential neighborhood context. Aim 3 is to understand how neighborhood context supports or
hinders obesity prevention by learning from parents’ lived experiences through focus groups. In collaboration
with a Community Advisory Board, we will integrate quantitative and qualitative findings from all aims and
provide recommendations to optimize prevention effectiveness. This project has the potential to exert a
sustained, powerful influence on the field of obesity prevention and health equity."

 Biomolecular condensates are dynamic, membrane-less organelles formed within cells, and both host
cells and viruses encode proteins that can assemble into these structures, facilitating essential cellular processes
and viral replication. My laboratory uses model plant viruses like Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) and Turnip
crinkle virus (TCV) to understand better virus-host interactions that take place in biomolecular condensates. Over
the next five years, our objectives encompass several key aspects. Initially, we will investigate the specific
mechanisms through which viral condensates, particularly focusing on p26 from PEMV2, disrupt cellular
translation. Additionally, we will utilize nanopore sequencing to explore their potential role in interfering with
fibrillarin-mediated 2'-O-methylation of ribosomal RNAs. We will use transcriptome-wide methodologies (e.g.,
TRAP-seq) to comprehensively investigate the impact of viral condensates on the translatome during infection
and test the hypothesis that viral condensates promote translational repression of antiviral transcripts while
enhancing translation of pro-viral transcripts. Using a similar approach, we will investigate whether viral
condensates function as a molecular switch, repressing the translation of viral transcripts to favor late stages of
the virus replication cycle, such as packaging and release.
 Next, we will shift our efforts to understanding how nuclear condensates formed by the coat protein (CP)
of TCV inhibit RNA interference (RNAi), potentially via the sequestration of siRNA precursors. We will also
investigate whether CP condensates interfere with the epigenetic regulation of siRNAs to alter their stability and
host gene expression. Our research program's overarching vision is to employ model systems to understand
better how viral biomolecular condensates disrupt cellular homeostasis, ultimately promoting virus fitness. This
research addresses a critical knowledge gap by investigating the impact of viral condensates on host cell
function, an area that has received limited attention compared to the extensive research on their effects on virus
replication. Our research will also yield novel virus-host interactions with potential applicability across diverse
RNA virus families, potentially serving as a foundation for developing innovative therapeutics. Finally, my
research program will develop undergraduate and Ph.D. students from diverse backgrounds. These students
can assume lead authorship roles in future manuscripts and engage in career development initiatives, including
international conferences."

The PENN Medicine Cell Therapy and Transplant Program (PENN CTT) is among the largest and oldest
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) programs in the nation. This active program sees patients of all genders,
races, ethnicities, socioeconomic status and individuals with disabilities and disadvantaged backgrounds. PENN
CTT conducts all forms of HCT including autologous and allogeneic (myeloablative and reduced intensity) from
all sources including cord blood, matched and mismatched related and unrelated donors and has been a pioneer
in gene modified T cell therapies for a myriad of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Dr. Edward Stadtmauer
has been the PI of this BMT CTN CCC since its founding in 2001, currently the Chair of the Steering Committee,
and has a number of leadership positions at PENN Medicine including Hematology-Oncology Division,
Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) and the Cancer Service Line so access to institutional resources and patients
for BMT CTN clinical trials is straightforward and this has been reflected in the strong accrual from our center.
Dr. David Porter, the Director of the CTT Program and President-elect of the ASTCT is a co-investigator of this
CCC for over 20 years. Additionally, two new co-investigators, Drs Elizabeth Hexner, Medical Director for our
Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (CCI), and Noelle Frey, Director of Cellular Therapy have been very active
in the Network activities and are well positioned for leadership succession. 587 patients have been accrued from
PENN CTT to BMT CTN; among the top 10 of >140 centers participating. PENN CTT has demonstrated
substantial intellectual leadership in the Network. PENN CTT investigators have served as members on 18
protocol teams (study chairs for 6) and members of 8 administrative and technical committees (chair of 3). PENN
CTT remains consistently very active with 2175 HCTs conducted in 2018-2022; 1446 autologous, 628 allogeneic
and 599 cellular therapies. The PENN CTT is supported by numerous world-class HCT patient care and research
resources including the ACC which was ranked ‘Exceptional’ as a NCI CCC in 2020; the CCI led by our pioneer
cellular immunobiologist Dr. Carl June; and the PENN-CHOP Blood Center focused on non-malignant blood
disorders run by Charles Abrams a renowned hematologist and past President ASH. Our research proposal, “A
phase 2 trial for patients with B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who achieve a measurable
residual disease (MRD) negative remission after brexu-cel randomized to a second infusion of brexu-cel
versus allogeneic HSCT or observation” was chosen among many alternatives from Penn to demonstrate an
area of our expertise, based on our own pilot study work, fill a major clinical need and can be completed in a
timely fashion. These attributes of strong clinical research, patient care, thought leaders in the field and
a documented enthusiasm for and success in BMT CTN trials uniquely position PENN CTT to lead
development and evaluation of novel cell therapies and rapidly disseminate results to benefit patients
in need of this life-saving therapy."
10940080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Commercial cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor implicated in one-third of all cancer deaths. Nicotine is
the chief addictive agent causing sustained smoking, but diverse tobacco products (e.g., e-cigarettes, FDA-
approved nicotine replacement) allow nicotine self-administration on a continuum of harm. Public health gains
could be substantial if people who use the most harmful products (i.e., combusted cigarettes) switch to a less
harmful nicotine product. Nicotine pouches – microfiber sachets containing powered nicotine but no tobacco
leaf – are a new class of oral tobacco products rapidly growing in popularity. Switching from cigarettes to
nicotine pouches is likely to be health-promoting because pouches are not combusted and contain fewer
harmful and potentially harmful chemicals than other tobacco products. However, we currently know very little
about how readily people who smoke will adopt nicotine pouches, how effectively pouches can substitute for
cigarettes when smokers are trying to avoid smoking, the importance of nicotine dose in effective cigarette
substitution, and the mechanisms that may promote or hinder product transition. To address these key gaps,
we will enroll 284 adults who smoke daily and are not planning to quit in the next 30 days in a randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive: 1) 3-mg nicotine pouches; 2) 6-mg
nicotine pouches; 3) nicotine mini-lozenges (2- or 4-mg); or 4) no study product. Participants receiving a study
product (nicotine pouches or nicotine mini lozenges) will be asked to use them for 4 weeks, an initial
experimentation week, and then for a 3-week switching trial where they will be asked not to smoke their usual
cigarettes and instructed instead to use their study product (if assigned one). Before and after the switching
trial, participants will come to the clinic following overnight abstinence and will use their assigned product (if
any) during a 30-minute sampling test to assess the duration of product use, subjective evaluations of study
products, and suppression of craving and withdrawal symptoms under controlled conditions. During the 4
weeks of the study, participants will use a smartphone app to record, in real-time, each time they use
cigarettes (primary outcome) or a study product. For a random daily subset of use events, participants will
answer additional questions about the context of their use (e.g., affect, any restrictions on smoking) and
potential mechanisms driving use (e.g., withdrawal alleviation, satisfaction). Participants will also complete 3
daily prompted random assessments to characterize non-use contexts. This innovative, rigorous, and timely
research will provide critical information regarding: (a) the potential impact of providing nicotine pouches on
smokers’ use of combusted cigarettes, (b) whether nicotine dose influences the ability of pouches to replace
cigarette use, (c) whether pouches substitute for cigarettes more effectively than FDA-approved nicotine mini
lozenges, and (d) product usage patterns and effects that may promote or hinder cigarette substitution These
data could inform regulatory policy decisions regarding the potential public health impact of nicotine pouches."

 Exploring cellular mechanics represents a groundbreaking frontier to unravel the complexities of life and
disease. Far from being static entities, cells are dynamic, active materials that generate and sustain mechanical
forces, serving as critical indicators for various pathologies. Despite remarkable strides in cell mechanics, we
stand in a new era that beckons us to surmount many challenges that have long stymied progress. These
challenges span from technological obstacles to limited versatile methodologies, each representing a unique
puzzle and challenge in biomechanics.
 Our MIRA program embarks on an unprecedented journey to address biomechanics challenges by
leveraging an interdisciplinary approach that melds the strengths of chemistry and mechanical engineering. The
PI's expertise in mechanochemistry, mechanical sensing, and fluorescent microscopy has positioned him as a
suitable researcher to use mechanochemical protocols to visualize biomechanical mapping into subcellular and
molecular levels. We will address the following challenges: First, the cell mechanics field lacks a versatile
technique for quantifying multiscale cell mechanics. Existing methods like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and
Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) offer partial solutions but come with their own sets of
limitations, such as intricate setups, specialized expertise, and low throughput. Second, high-precision, real-time
force measurements at the nanoscale are missing. While AFM provides nanoscale resolution, its limitations for
in vivo applications and the viscoelastic nature of cells add layers of complexity that further complicate data
interpretation. Third, the obstacle of accurately measuring in vivo dynamic biomechanical regulations is a
significant hurdle in cell mechanics. Existing techniques, although precise, are generally unsuitable for in vivo
applications due to their invasive nature and complex setups. The dynamic milieu of living systems further
complicates the issue, demanding rapid and continuous measurements. These challenges are not mere
obstacles; they are opportunities, beckoning us to innovate, explore, and revolutionize biomechanics. As we
embark on this exhilarating journey, we are not just solving puzzles but pushing the boundaries of what is
possible, opening new avenues for research and clinical applications.
This MIRA program will establish a pioneering analytical platform for biomechanics, from building a
comprehensive library of Molecular Force Gauges (MFGs), integrating these force gauges into various biological
targets for precise biomechanical measurements, to developing a state-of-the-art super-resolution
biomechanical microscopy BM-STORM to visualize and quantify cellular and subcellular biomechanics with
unprecedented detail. Our research agenda will be based on a three-fold approach. First, we will pioneer a
comprehensive library of Molecular Force Gauges (MFGs) designed to offer unprecedented insights into cellular
and subcellular mechanics. These MFGs are ingeniously engineered to undergo optical or luminescent
transformations in response to mechanical forces, serving as real-time, nanoscale force sensors. Our approach
addresses the limitations of existing technologies like flipper probes and FRET, offering a more direct and
versatile method for force quantification. Second, we will utilize these MFGs to sense both compressive and
tensile forces across various biological targets. This dual-mode operation enriches our understanding of
membrane mechanics and offers a robust and reliable metric for tension measurements. Third, we will develop
an innovative super-resolution biomechanical microscopy, BM-STORM, to visualize and quantify cellular and
subcellular biomechanics with unprecedented detail. This system leverages mechanical force to control the
switching between bright and dark states of MFGs, offering a biomechanical counterpart to Stochastic Optical
Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM). Our multidimensional approach will address the most pressing challenges
in biomechanics, from multiscale force quantification to real-time, in vivo imaging. Through these innovations,
we will elevate the field of biomechanics to an unprecedented level.
Our approach is inherently flexible, allowing for the seamless incorporation of other possible MFGs and the
adoption of other new super-resolution microscopy techniques. Our long-term vision, spanning 5 to 20 years, is
to evolve this biomechanical measurement platform into a robust, reliable, and versatile set of protocols. This
will pave the way for groundbreaking advancements, including in vivo biomechanical testing, three-dimensional
biomechanical mapping, and deep-tissue biomechanical monitoring."
10946273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pre-eclampsia is an obstetric condition that affects 5–8% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal
mortality worldwide. Pre-eclampsia is characterized by the onset of maternal hypertension after 20 weeks of
gestation, stemming from insufficient remodeling of the uterine spiral arteries that supply blood flow to the
placenta and fetus. Clinical treatments for pre-eclampsia, such as antihypertensive drugs to manage blood
pressure and anticonvulsants to prevent seizures, address the associated symptoms, yet no drug or therapeutic
has been developed to slow the progression of pre-eclampsia. The only curative treatment option for pre-
eclampsia is the early delivery of the placenta and fetus, which often resolves maternal hypertension within a
few days, but can cause fetal morbidity and mortality, especially in cases where fetal growth restriction occurs
concurrently with pre-eclampsia. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for novel therapeutic strategies that
can facilitate vasodilation in the placenta during pre-eclampsia to resolve maternal hypertension and improve
fetal health. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
for extrahepatic mRNA delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic platform to treat pre-eclampsia. The
goal of the proposed work is to develop a targeted, placenta-tropic LNP platform for the delivery of mRNA cargo
to the placenta to treat pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. First, high-throughput in vivo screening will be utilized
to evaluate a large library of LNPs with novel ionizable lipid structures and excipient compositions for extrahepatic
tropism to the placenta. Lead candidates from this high-throughput screen will be functionalized with active
targeting motifs, namely placenta-specific antibodies, for selective delivery to trophoblasts and endothelial cells
in vivo. Following enrichment analysis using next generation sequencing, LNPs demonstrating placental tropism
will be functionalized with placental-specific antibodies to promote active targeting to key cell types in the
placenta — trophoblasts and endothelial cells. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo expression of therapeutic mRNA
cargos (VEGF, PlGF, and eNOS) encapsulated in LNPs will then be evaluated in primary human and mouse
placentas. The lead mRNA LNP candidates will then be utilized to rescue maternal hypertension, fetal health,
and immunophenotype in an induced model of severe, early onset pre-eclampsia in mice. The work proposed
here is the first to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pro-angiogenic mRNA LNPs for treating pre-eclampsia,
a placental disorder during pregnancy for which currently no curative treatment options exist. Due to the modular
nature of LNPs and the ability to readily swap mRNA cargoes, the platform developed through the completion of
these studies can be used for treating not only pre-eclampsia, but also a wide range of placental disorders
occurring during pregnancy."

physician investigators into academic research-focused careers in Otolaryngology. Therefore the goal of
this new R25 application is to provide exceptional research training in otolaryngology-related research to
carefully selected medical students and Otolaryngology residents. Trainees will receive research training and
career development to set them up with the skills required to become outstanding clinician scientists
able to perform high impact research. Resident trainees will undergo 18 months of research integrated
into their 6 year residency training program. Research training for medical students will occur in the third
year of medical school with a dedicated 9 month research block.
One resident and one medical student with exceptional research promise and dedication to an
academic career in Otolaryngology will be selected from diverse applicant pools and admitted each
year into the research training program. The Department of Otolaryngology has a balanced, well-funded
and expanding research portfolio and an excellent track record of producing physician scientists through
our existing NIDCD T32 training grant. Funded faculty with active research programs will serve as research
mentors and clinically-focused faculty will serve as career mentors. The wider community at The University
of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus has major strengths in all areas related to Otolaryngology including
hearing, balance, smell, taste, speech, language and disorders of communication and head and neck
cancer. The research training faculty has existing extensive research collaborations which will continue to
grow and foster an outstanding team-based training environment and unique training experience for
each of our trainees. The intensive research and mentoring program for each trainee will involve
individualized development plans, training in innovative research methods, structured didactics and rigorous
ethics education."

One of the areas of emphasis on the National Eye Institute's (NEI) strategic plan is to bridge the gap between
genomics and mechanisms of disease. Vast clinically relevant information on diseases, demographics,
exposures, and traits is captured in electronic health records (EHRs). This phenome data can be overlayed on
biospecimen-derived data (such as genetic variants) and interrogated to uncover and clarify disease
associations. These associations can in turn help us infer mechanisms of disease, contextualize clinical
observations, develop risk prediction models for clinical management, and identify new research directions.
Phecodes quickly capture a coded representation of the entire phenome in EHRs without accessing identifiable
information, thus allowing an unrestricted exploration of any disease or phenotype as a potential cause or
consequence of all others. Phecodes were last revised in 2013, when we published a replication study of known
genetic associations from published GWAS. The current version of our phecodes (v1.2) has proven useful for
numerous research applications and, as such, has been incorporated into novel phenome-based research
pipelines to accelerate the study of both rare and complex diseases. However, our preliminary work shows that
phecode v1.2's hierarchical structure lacks the resolution required to accurately identify many sigh-threatening
conditions. This limits the scope of eye-related knowledge that can be gleaned from phenome-dependent
association studies using biobanks. Our goal is to support new and evolving use-cases for phecodes to study
eye-related diseases and health disparities in diverse biobanks. To fill this gap, we recently created a new
version of phecodes (PheX) with enhanced granularity to resolve and capture many more clinical diagnoses than
v1.2. We propose to: (1) Compare the resolution and reliability of PheX (vs. v1.2) to capture common and rare
eye phenotypes; (2) Develop linkages between eye related-PheXs and numerous controlled vocabularies and
ontologies for research; (3) Test the scalability of PheX in external biobanks through replication of eye disease
GWAS results to enhance generalizability of association studies to diverse populations; (4) Incorporate PheX
into novel phecode-based research pipelines; (5) Use PheX for PheWAS to study comorbid associations and to
develop a catalog of morbidity and comorbidity maps with a focus on population disparities; (6) Incorporate post-
coordination methods for phecode terms to enhance phenome capture; and (7) Share the new eye-specific PheX
(iPheX) along with quality assessment methods in easily accessible and deployable packages to facilitate
ophthalmic research in diverse biobanks. This project meets several strategic goals of the NIH and NEI,
including: (1) enriching our awareness of ocular epidemiology in groups under-represented in vision science and
identifying risk factors for ocular disease in underserved populations (we will use All of Us, a biobank with
intentional population diversity); (2) using science to integrate cross-modality data to understand diseases
(genomics, phenomics); and (3) understanding how genomic variants affect disease."
10944269,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 60% of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) respond to the psychotherapy of
choice, exposure and response prevention (ERP). Unfortunately, troubling symptoms persist for most patients,
even treatment responders. ERP is believed to depend on safety learning and engagement of related brain
circuitry. OCD patients have repeatedly demonstrated deficits in safety learning and memory processes, but
important gaps exist in this literature. In particular, there are limited data on neural functions related to safety
learning and memory deficits in OCD. This is important as multiple studies have shown that OCD is associated
with dysconnectivity in large-scale networks that are implicated in fear signaling and to safety learning, namely,
the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Preliminary research by the PI suggests that that
anodal (excitatory) frontopolar (over the anterior medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) multifocal transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) reduced resting functional connectivity between these networks and accelerates
safety learning in community volunteers. Preliminary research by the PI also suggests that frontopolar tDCS
accelerates safety learning during a single session of in vivo ERP with patients diagnosed with OCD. The
proposed R01 project would be the first to examine if OCD is associated with deficits in inhibitory safety
learning – fear extinction learning that is acquired after original fear conditioning has been consolidated into
long-term memory – and would be among the first to probe neural functions associated with extinction deficits
in OCD. The proposed R01 project would also replicate and extend the PI’s exciting preliminary findings to test
if frontopolar tDCS can normalize dysconnectivity and functional activity within and between the DMN and SN
and recover safety learning deficits in patients with OCD. Results from this project would pave the way for
additional experimental therapeutics target engagement research; research that examine the effects of
frontopolar tDCS on neural abnormalities and safety learning deficits in other anxious psychopathology (e.g.,
posttraumatic stress disorder) and clinical trials examining the interactive effects of frontopolar tDCS and ERP
on brain dysconnectivity and symptoms of OCD."
10947236,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer and 3rd leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States. Poor dietary quality and the gut microbiome are related modifiable factors implicated
in the burden of this disease. However, the mechanisms through which they interact to impact CRC development
and progression are poorly understood. Our team previously developed the novel Empirical Dietary Inflammatory
Pattern (EDIP) score based on plasma inflammatory markers. A higher EDIP score is linked with higher levels
of inflammation and a higher risk of developing CRC and dying from the disease. Though diet has been shown
to modulate the gut microbiome, the dietary effects that trigger inflammation and dysbiosis in CRC are largely
unknown. We have shown that a pro-inflammatory dietary pattern (higher EDIP) is associated with a higher risk
of developing CRC in which the tumor is depleted in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and that among CRC
survivors, higher post-diagnosis EDIP also predisposed patients to die from tumors with depleted TILs, but not
tumors with high levels of TILs. We further demonstrated that higher EDIP was associated with greater risk of
colorectal tumors enriched with a bacterium called Fusobacterium nucleatum but not with tumors negative for F.
nucleatum. These findings shed light on a potential mechanism for how diet-related inflammation may influence
CRC tumor development and progression. However, our studies were limited to a single bacterium in colon
tissue, and we now have the ability and expertise to use more robust methods to identify diverse microbes
(bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc) and a wider range of host immune cells within tumors. Based on our preliminary
data, we will test the overarching hypothesis that a pro-inflammatory dietary pattern reduces concentrations of
important cancer-fighting immune cells in the colon and alters the overall balance of microbes in colon tissue,
thereby increasing the risk of developing aggressive CRC that will lead to death. We will leverage data among
291 men and women in the Colocare cohort with diet and stool samples to identify gut microbes associated with
EDIP and assess their impact on survival among CRC patients. In addition, we will utilize RNAseq data from the
Oncology Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) among 2500 CRC patients to identify microbes and immune
cell in CRC tumor tissue linked to EDIP and determine their impact on tumor clinical characteristics (e.g., CRC
stage), host factors (e.g., sex, body mass index), and survival outcomes (recurrence, all-cause mortality, CRC
mortality). At the completion of our study, we expect to have a) identified the microbes associated with the
inflammatory dietary pattern in the gut and within CRC tumor tissue and b) determined how these EDIP-related
microbes are linked to survival outcomes among CRC patients for the first time. These results will inform the
design of larger studies of dietary strategies for mitigating dysbiosis in the gut and tumor tissue associated with
proinflammatory (high-EDIP) dietary patterns and CRC progression. These novel strategies may also serve as
adjunct therapies to improve anti-cancer treatment responses while reducing side effects."

use is known to be harmful to adolescent health, resulting in nicotine-related symptoms of addiction and
various other health issues (e.g., depressive symptoms), and is associated with use of other addictive
substances. In spite of the urgent need to address this issue, there is a lack of effective interventions for
adolescent e-cigarette cessation. Thus, effective and sustainable interventions to address adolescent e-
cigarette use are urgently needed. This study is aimed at creating a scalable e-cigarette use cessation
intervention using a smartphone application (app), which can be delivered to a large pool of adolescents. This
study will test and launch a scalable smartphone AI-enhanced app-based intervention delivery that can be
feasibly implemented in schools, primary care clinics, and community settings for adolescent e-cigarette
cessation. An artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced smartphone app-based intervention is a cost-effective
strategy that facilitates personalized messages for behavioral problems. Using AI-assisted user profiling
techniques based on participants’ e-cigarette use status, patterns, other substance use status, readiness to
quit e-cigarettes, and beliefs about e-cigarettes, this intervention will send personalized content with
mindfulness-based training modules. Timely messages will be sent in response to users’ urges to use e-
cigarettes based on self-report in real time through the smartphone app. In addition, AI will be able to answer
app users’ questions via an automated chatbot. We will pilot test the intervention for summative evaluation
using a quasi-randomized controlled study using a delayed intervention design. In Phase 1, we will refine a
smartphone app-based intervention based on feedback obtained from participant interviews on usability
(functions, interface, and content), a usability survey, and a task performance test. In Phase 2, we will pilot test
the intervention using a quasi-randomized controlled study design. We will examine the usability via a usability
survey, and participants’ engagement on the app use via frequency of AI-app use (each feature), data entered
in the app, and minutes of app use per day. In addition, we will examine the e-cigarette cessation related
outcome changes of the app-based intervention by evaluating e-cigarette use frequencies compared to the
control group (3 month delayed intervention) in terms of quit rates at post-intervention, 30-days and 3-months
post-intervention; number of days e-cigarette used in the past 30 days; number of quit attempts; intention to
quit; readiness to quit; nicotine addiction; and beliefs and perceptions about e-cigarettes. We will examine the
feasibility of the intervention based on user experiences of functions, interface, content. Over the long term,
findings from this study will contribute useful information for those testing the effectiveness of smartphone app-
based interventions for adolescent e-cigarette use cessation on a large scale."

Laser scanning microscopy (LSM) – including optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal and multiphoton
microscopy (MPM) – allows imaging thick, living tissue at depth, and thus has been widely adopted for many
biological contexts. To facilitate further research and discovery, increase in the total information capacity with
larger fields-of-view, faster imaging, or deeper penetration is desired, but is ultimately limited by tissue heating.
This project will employ distributed amplification in optical fibers – a technique pioneered and honed for
telecommunications – in order to bypass this limitation. Two fiber-based amplifier and detection systems (F-
BADS) will be constructed leveraging both the sensitivity of optical amplification, and the bandwidth and dynamic
range of photodiode detectors in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition speed of LSM
by ~100-fold relative to conventional detection modalities. The first F-BADS will employ Raman amplification in
multi-mode fibers to provide gain in the visible spectrum. The module will be installed into an existing two-photon
microscope and characterize the benefits in SNR and speed afforded by this technique relative to photo-
multiplier-tube-based detection. The second F-BADS will use four-wave mixing in single-mode fiber (SMF) to
provide gain in the 13XX tissue transparency window. The SMF-based design of this amplifier will facilitate
alignment-free integration into a fiber-based reflectance microscope. SNR, speed, and penetration depth
achievable with this method will be characterized for both confocal microscopy and OCT. Both proposed F-BADS
are drop-in compatible as add-on modules for any microscope, and can amplify spatially coherent or incoherent
light across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, including broadband fluorescent signals. Therefore, these
proof-of-principle demonstrations of the utility of nonlinear fiber optical amplification will encourage wide adoption
for a broad range of optical imaging applications, as well as facilitate further scaling of LSM information capacity."

Most mental health (MH) disorders develop in early childhood but are not clinically identified or treated until
later—delaying treatment services that could prevent the enduring effects of long-term MH problems.
Moreover, low income, ethno-racial minoritized children who exhibit higher rates of persistent MH disorders,
are at greater risk for lags in identification and treatment. Head Start (HStart) has shown early school success
for low-income children, aged 3-5 years, who are disproportionately Black or Latinx. HStart monitors for early
childhood MH symptoms, yet studies have found that when detected, only those most impaired are referred for
treatment. In our research, we learned that systemic and individual level barriers preclude early treatment
among HStart preschoolers with developmental concern. We showed that caregivers encountered system
barriers of HStart teachers and primary care providers (PCPs) falling behind in referrals for intervention, and
caregiver beliefs about stigma, their limited knowledge and distrust of healthcare hindered early engagement in
services. Studies on MH treatment obstacles for low-income, ethno-racial minoritized people illustrate similar
barriers to those found among HStart preschoolers with developmental concern. Our team developed and
tested an ethno-racially matched, peer-based family navigator program for HStart preschoolers with
developmental concern. Navigators used trust and empowerment to increase caregiver advocacy thereby
leading to improved professional alliances and treatment. A navigator program for those with primary MH
concern has not been trialed. In this R34 pilot effectiveness trial, we propose to take this next critical step by
tailoring and preliminary testing in a case series the Navigate-Train-Referral-Intervention Mental Health (NTRI-
MH) intervention to promote access, engagement, coordination, and optimization of services for preschoolers
with MH symptoms. In Aim 1, we will use focus group feedback from caregiver, navigator, HStart teacher, and
PCP stakeholders (n=30) to adapt NTRI-MH and create a web-based dashboard to monitor outcomes. Then,
conduct a feasibility study for caregivers of HStart preschoolers with MH symptoms, guided by ethno-racially
matched family navigators and referrals by HStart teachers and PCPs (n=20). In Aim 2, we will pilot test NTRI-
MH for caregivers of preschoolers with MH symptoms compared to an active control group of caregivers who
receive child behavior training (n=86). We will trial the effectiveness of the NTRI-MH mechanisms of caregiver
beliefs on MH, empowerment, and professional alliances on family functioning and child emotion regulation. If
the aims of the project are achieved, this study would have a large impact on early MH service use for low
income ethno-racial minoritized young children with the potential to improve child MH outcomes."

Behavioral and social science research (BSSR) is instrumental in comprehending Alzheimer's Disease and
related dementia (ADRD) and its far-reaching implications for individuals, families, and communities. BSSR
investigates how behavioral and social determinants, encompassing factors like physical activity, cognitive
engagement, diet, and social interactions, influence the risk of developing AD. This exploration aims to uncover
non-pharmacological interventions that can manage symptoms and enhance the well-being of individuals with
AD/ADRD, including cognitive stimulation programs, behavioral therapies, social engagement initiatives, and
caregiver training. Moreover, BSSR delves into the social, cultural, and environmental elements contributing to
health disparities, informing tailored interventions and policies for various populations, especially underserved
and minority communities. Collectively, this research enriches our understanding of ADRD and guides the
development of interventions, support systems, and policies to enhance the lives of those affected by the
disease. Yet, there are challenges impeding the integration of ADRD-related BSSR data. A critical issue is the
absence of formal representations for BSSR data and limited tools to link comprehensive BSSR information from
diverse sources. This hampers the holistic consideration of BSSR factors in AD-related research, undermining
evidence-based care and support. In response to PAR-23-182, we propose pioneering ontology-based
approaches to formally represent ADRD-related BSSR factors in a standardized manner. We will develop natural
language processing (NLP) methods to extract and normalize BSSR data from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) and literature. Our project aims to integrate structured and unstructured data across various research
silos, culminating in a comprehensive and normalized knowledge graph incorporating BSSR factors for ADRD
cohorts. More specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop the Behavioral Social Data and Knowledge Ontology for
ADRD (BSO-AD) to standardize BSSR factors. We will also assess the BSO-AD for correctness and suitability,
refining it based on evaluation scores. Aim 2 employs NLP technologies, including state-of-the-art large language
models, to extract and normalize BSSR-related information from clinical notes and literature. This NLP system
will ensure semantic interoperability and consistency in entity recognition and normalization. In Aim 3, we will
create a knowledge graph (KG) to integrate annotated BSSR factors from structured and unstructured sources,
supporting ADRD-related research and applications. We will evaluate the ontology and KG through
demonstration studies and disseminate these resources to the research community, promoting collaborative
research efforts. In summary, our project aims to bridge the gap in ADRD-related BSSR data integration by
standardizing representation, enabling efficient extraction, and fostering collaboration within the research
community. This endeavor will advance our understanding of ADRD and contribute to evidence-based care and
support for affected individuals and their communities."
10945242,"This project seeks to generate new insights – of clinical and public/health/relevance – regarding 
the early identification and prevention of adult coronary heart disease (CHD). It is well known 
that 10% of infants born small for gestational age (SGA), compared to average for gestational 
infants (AGA), are at increased risk for later life CHD and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
mortality. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in these findings and it is not clear: a) 
which SGA infants are at elevated risk; and b) which underlying pathobiologic mechanisms are 
implicated. Based upon our published work and those of others, we hypothesize that fetal 
programming related to placental dysfunction, chronic fetal hypoxia, nutrient deprivation and 
cardiac remodeling in some SGA infants results in cardiovascular and metabolic alterations and 
subsequent increased CHD risk. Understanding which SGA infants are at elevated risk, and by 
what mechanisms are critical steps to advance prevention efforts through targeted screening 
and early intervention practices.
The New England Family Study (NEFS) is a prenatal cohort of 16,000 individuals now aged 57-
64 years, offspring of pregnant women enrolled in the Providence, RI and Boston, MA sites of 
the NIH Collaborative Perinatal Project. Participants were recruited between 1959 and 1966, 
prenatal and infant umbilical cord serum samples collected, and offspring assessed through the 
first 7 years of life, providing a unique cohort to address these topics. Our multidisciplinary team 
with an established collaborative track record proposes to complete comprehensive clinical 
assessments of approximately 800 SGA infants from this cohort. We will be able to conduct this 
60-year prospective project - with state-of-the-art adult cardiovascular assessments - based 
upon 35 years fieldwork with this cohort and prior experience of clinical assessments with large 
samples of community participants. Using banked maternal and infant sera, we will evaluate 
prenatal (mother’s 3rd trimester) serum for markers of: a) placental dysfunction and impaired 
vasculogenesis (placental growth factor (PIGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 
(SFLT-1) / PGIF ratio and b) metabolomics as evidence of maternal metabolic programming – in 
relation to adult offspring CHD risk. Using cord serum samples, we will investigate evidence of 
chronic fetal hypoxia (erythropoietin levels), lipids, and metabolomics as measures of metabolic 
programming and fetal NT-pro-BNP and hs-TcNT-T as reflective of cardiac programming in 
SGA infants – in relation to adult offspring CVD risk. Plans and implications detailed herein.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic, multi-organ process characterized by inspissated secretions that adversely
impact the upper and lower airway, gastrointestinal tract, and other organ systems. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)
is a prevalent and clinically impactful disease complication in individuals with CF. CRS is detrimental to quality
of life, impairs pulmonary status and worsens overall disease state. Olfactory dysfunction is a key feature of
CRS, further worsens quality of life, and is associated with depression and nutritional alterations. These
comorbidities are significantly understudied in young children with CF (YCwCF). Highly effective CF
transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy (HEMT) improves pulmonary health and certain extra-
pulmonary domains for adults with CF. Previous research showed that adults with CF have substantial
improvement in CRS after HEMT initiation. However, prior work demonstrated that adults treated with HEMT did
not have improvements in olfactory dysfunction or have complete resolution of sinus disease. Given that airway
inflammation and infection are present for a short time in young children (before starting HEMT), we anticipate
that initiating therapy at an early age will lead to substantial improvement in CRS and olfactory dysfunction. The
goals of this study are to characterize CRS and olfactory dysfunction in YCwCF and test the hypothesis that
these comorbidities improve with HEMT. This prospective, observational, multi-center study will pair with a
prospective, observational, multi-center study of outcomes in YCwCF that will investigate changes in other
domains (pulmonary, microbiological, endocrine, and gastrointestinal) following initiation of HEMT. In this study,
CRS and olfactory dysfunction will be evaluated using validated, age-appropriate, objective and subjective, non-
invasive outcome measures. A treatment group will be comprised of YCwCF who initiate HEMT. A control group
will be comprised of YCwCF who do not initiate HEMT. Both groups will be followed for two years and the groups
will be age-matched. Analysis will use mixed-effect models for longitudinal data to compare outcomes between
groups and incorporate propensity scoring. Specific Aim 1 will characterize CRS and olfactory dysfunction in
YCwCF. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HEMT improves CRS in YCwCF utilizing sinus magnetic
resonance imaging opacification and sinonasal symptom burden. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
HEMT improves olfactory dysfunction in YCwCF using olfactory bulb volume, quantitative olfactory function,
olfactory cleft opacification, and olfactory-specific quality of life. Findings from this research will inform strategies
that will lead to greater overall health status and improved quality of life. Results will highlight the importance of
complication evaluation and management early in life."

Protecting children through the primary prevention of child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a major priority given that
an estimated 1 in 7 children are affected each year in the U.S. and the societal cost of CAN is of over $400
billion. Even though there are many evidence-based programs to prevent abuse, reduce harm, and treat trauma,
there remain numerous barriers for policymakers to craft scientifically-informed policies to protect children.
Accordingly, we propose an experimental study of a formal, theory-based approach for supporting policymakers’
use of scientific evidence that does not involve lobbying—the Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) Model.
The RPC fosters productive engagement between the policy and research communities by implementing
systematic capacity building and outreach strategies. Previous experimental work on the RPC demonstrated the
ability of this model to increase engagement between researchers and policymakers, increase policymakers’
value for research evidence, and improve their use of scientific evidence in their policymaking. We propose a
state-level randomized controlled trial of the RPC (N = 30 state legislatures) that will evaluate the model’s ability
to improve engagement between state policymakers and the science community, build policymakers’ awareness
and value of CAN research, and subsequently increase their use of research evidence throughout the
policymaking process. To accomplish this, we will test three specific research aims. Aim 1 will assess historical
and current use of research evidence in state legislation pertaining to policies to protect children and provide
equitable service delivery. This will involve qualitative coding of bills introduced by state legislatures over the last
five years. Aim 2 will compare the frequency and quality of engagement with CAN researchers between the
intervention and control conditions. Additionally, we will assess how the RPC model influences policymakers’
value and awareness of CAN research and evidence-based programs over time using a validated survey across
three time points. Aim 3 will evaluate the effectiveness of the RPC on legislators’ actual use of research in
legislation by observing and quantifying changes in legislator behavior related to research use. Improving the
use of scientific information in policymaking can reduce population-level CAN and protect children by increasing
the availability of evidence-based prevention programs and policies."
10943949,"The initiators and/or drivers of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) remain elusive. Current knowledge
suggests that interventions in late disease stages may not be as effective as earlier in the disease due to a
“domino effect”, wherein there are many inflammatory factors acting later in the disease. We posit that there is
value in doing proof of mechanism studies to identify biological effects at the early stage of disease. The major
genetic risk factors include CFH on chromosome1 and ARMS2/HTRA1 on chromosome 10. Despite genetic
heterogeneity, most subjects with AMD show common early pathology that include drusen formation and
complement activation. Based on these common features, the core structures affected in AMD that require
further investigation are the RPE, Bruch’s membrane (BrM) and the choroid. The recent discovery of induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) tissue models to study disease mechanisms and the ability to assemble 3D tissues
permit the study of cell-cell interactions. We have designed a 3D tissue chip which includes an RPE monolayer
sitting on a choroid containing endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes which eventually form a BrM to
complete the structure. Since the endothelial cells undergo anastomosis the final choroidal vasculature can be
perfused to more closely mimic the in vivo environment. Our current goal is to utilize this model to characterize
the responses of the RPE-choroid to various environmental stressors under the influence of the CFH and
ARMS2/HTRA1 risk genotypes. Please note, not only can we assemble the 3D oBRB from different donors,
but we can subsequently analyze four different parts; the supernatant in the top compartment (i.e., sub-retinal
space), the flowthrough in the bottom compartment (i.,e, blood supply of the choroid), as well as the two tissue
compartments, RPE/BrM and CC. Aim 1 will characterize the perfused 3D RPE/choroid chip and provide
baseline data for our readouts (gene expression patterns based on scRNA-Seq; extracellular and intracellular
complement activation; BrM formation over time; and extracellular vesicle analysis). In Aim 2, we ask how
these parameters are affected genetic risk factors, assembling the RPE/choroid complex from iPSC cells using
a combination of RPE-risk with choroid-non-risk or vice versa. And finally, in Aim 3, we characterize the
response of the perfused 3D RPE/choroid chip to AMD relevant stressors, smoke, fatty acid exposure and
alteration in flow rate. Overall, our data will provide unique knowledge about the influence of genetic variation
on complement secretion, expression and synthesis of intracellular and extracellular complement from pre-
drusen to post-drusen development, and the proposal’s outcomes will fill a critical gap in our understanding of
genetic variants on RPE complement activity and identify new potential therapeutic targets directed at the RPE
in the early stages of AMD."
10944711,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lack of oxygenation and nutrients that result from narrowed arteries and reduced blood flow debilitates the
normal function of the heart, leading to severe morbidity and early mortality worldwide. This devastating acute
medical episode is often seen in patients with obstructive plaques in their arteries. As a result, coronary artery
disease is the root cause of ischemic cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction. Despite that a
healthy lifestyle and standard care may deter development of these diseases, risk factors such as obesity,
dyslipidemia, diabetes, and high blood pressure elevate the odds of recurrent myocardial infarction, leading to
heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, or even death as well as a major financial burden to the society.
Reperfusion after acute myocardial infarction introduced by coronary angioplasty and direct stenting can cause
further damage to the injured heart. Unfortunately, the scarcity of novel molecular targets that stimulate natural
new blood vessel growth to restore blood flow and augment heart repair and regeneration creates a daunting
fight against this deleterious condition, for which there is currently no cure. The long-term goal of our research
is to discern molecular insight into endothelial regulation and heart regeneration in health and disease. In this
application, we aim to decipher molecular mechanisms behind the action of cardiac endothelial epsins in
regulating in myocardial ischemia. Epsins are a family of prominent endocytic adaptor proteins that were
originally discovered by the PI. We recently reported that targeting epsins in macrophages in atherosclerotic
plaques by nanoparticle-mediated delivery of epsin siRNAs prevents atheroma progression and promotes
atheroma regression, suggesting epsins as an emerging target for treating coronary artery disease in
preclinical models. Harnessing newly developed snRNA sequencing technologies, we made a potentially
groundbreaking discovery where the loss of cardiac endothelial epsins potentiates endothelial cell expansion
and precursor cell transition to fuel vascularization in neonatal hearts. We see heightened neovascularization,
bolstered cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal hearts of inducible endothelial-specific epsin 1 and 2 double
knockout (EC-iDKO) mice. Consistently, elevated revascularization, enhanced cardiac function and improved
heart repair and recovery from myocardial infarction in adult EC-iDKO mice. We posit that inhibition of cardiac
endothelial epsins fortifies angiocrine signals such as CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling, enable creation of a vast
endothelial cell reservoir to build vascular networks in the heart. Our central hypotheses are that epsins in the
cardiac endothelium suppress endothelial expansion, in part, by repressing CXCR4 signaling and hindering
heart regeneration and repair following myocardial ischemia. If successful, our proposed work will explore
uncharted territory, uncover original regulatory mechanisms, identify novel modulators, and inaugurate new
classes of restorative and regenerative therapies to treat deadly ischemic heart diseases and heart failure."
10952676,"Modeling human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases has been historically difficult, with current
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models often showing mild phenotypes. While iPSC systems capture
disease-associated genetic variants, generating these cells erases cellular age – a critical component of many
neurodegenerative diseases. An alternative approach is the direct conversion of fibroblasts into neurons, which
preserves the epigenetic age of the starting cells. As such, this approach has been highly successful in modeling
pathologies of various neurodegenerative diseases including tauopathies, Huntington’s disease, and Alzheimer’s
disease.
 In the proposed research project, we will employ direct neuronal conversion as a new tool to investigate
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and associated frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We will initially study familial
ALS cells that have been converted into induced motor neurons and subsequently probe for neurodegenerative
phenotypes. We have already observed stress-induced degeneration in the context of multiple ALS-associated
mutations. Removal of epigenetic age via iPSC conversion and antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of mutant
proteins will establish the specificity of this system. We will further expand our studies to sporadic ALS lines,
investigating neurodegeneration-associated features including nuclear pore deficits. Finally, cells from ALS/FTD
patients will be converted into a cortical identity to provide a novel model for FTD. With these models, we can
interrogate disease mechanisms in ALS/FTD. Further, the development of a tractable, patient-derived in vitro
model of familial and sporadic ALS would represent a considerable breakthrough for the ALS research
community, facilitating the eventual development of novel therapeutic agents."

 Children's community violence exposure (CVE) is a public health crisis, and racial and ethnic disparities
are well-documented. As a source of toxic stress, CVE can lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes,
disproportionately affects children in racially and economically segregated communities, and perpetuates
health disparities. Concentrated neighborhood disadvantage and limited access to youth services (in
combination with family and individual factors) influence and exacerbate disparities in CVE11-12. Over the past 7
years we have developed a novel, interdisciplinary, pediatric healthcare model that provides psychological and
psychiatric trauma-informed assessment, social work-focused case management, and treatment planning
across a short period (3-sessions) within a general medical center. Our target population are pediatric patients
and their families who are affected by community violence, whether or not they have been injured. The
University of Chicago Medicine REACT (Recovery & Empowerment After Community Trauma) Clinic4 is
a trauma-informed intervention focused on healing, rather than risk, to empower minoritized and systematically
oppressed CVE urban families. The REACT Clinic is located on Chicago’s South Side in one of the most
racially and economically segregated cities in the US.5-7 The REACT Clinic is innovative because it is the only
SAMHSA funded clinic in the US that provides Black youth, within the Chicago metropolitan area, with free,
accessible, high-quality, anti-racist, structurally and culturally responsive, strengths-based, interdisciplinary
care to specifically address effects of community violence and trauma. To date, the impact of the REACT
program has not been systematically evaluated.
 Both pilot data from REACT families and a robust prior literature8-10 suggest that the mechanisms most
associated with mental healthcare utilization (MHCU) are mental health stigma, healthcare distrust, and mental
health literacy. Thus, the objective of this two-year proposal is to systematically test whether the REACT Clinic
model is related to changes in the these three mechanisms after completion of services and at 3-month follow-
up. The study proposes a longitudinal, within-person, mixed-method approach to collect and analyze data from
a sample of 48 Black youth aged 12 -18 and their primary caregivers who have received REACT service
following CVE. The study has three goals: (1) employ a mixed methods design to examine acceptability,
feasibility, and adherence to the REACT Clinic model; (2) examine the impact of the REACT Clinic on proximal
outcomes (MHS, MHL, HCD) as reported by caregivers (n=48), at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 month
follow-up; and 3) establish initial estimates of MHCU (distal outcome) and explore whether metrics of
acceptability and adherence and/or changes in proximal outcomes are associated with MHCU at 3-month
follow-up."

 Early detection and sensitive tracking of cognitive changes related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
pathology (amyloid-Aβ and tau), particularly those that are scaleable to the large at-risk population of older
adults, are urgently needed. Promising digital tools to measure cognitive changes must be validated in
demographically diverse groups to ensure that research advancements are generalizable to those most at-risk
for cognitive decline. Our recent work suggests that diminished learning over repeated evaluations (i.e., testing
memory for the same content for 12min/day for 7 days) reveals subtle Aβ-related memory failures that are
otherwise undetectable using single timepoint measures. More specifically, 29 Aβ+ clinically unimpaired (CU)
older adults failed to improve at the same rate as their 97 Aβ- CU peers when asked to learn and recall
identical content daily with this group difference emerging after ~3 days. We now seek to determine whether
this Personal Learning Curve (PLC) paradigm can be used to detect early memory failures related to AD
biomarkers in a larger and more diverse and representative sample and whether PLCs can sensitively track
longitudinal cognitive decline when repeated bi-annually. We have the unique opportunity to recruit an
extremely well-characterized and representative at-risk sample (i.e., 32% from URG, family history of cognitive
decline, hypertension, geographic diversity, English and Spanish speaking) with AD biomarkers (global Aβ,
temporal tau quantified via Positron Emission Tomography-PET) and annual cognitive testing. Recruited
participants (n=300) will have completed the active phase of U.S. POINTER, a two-year clinical trial of two
different multi-domain lifestyle interventions to protect brain health. We will explore whether a PLC, collected
12min/day for 7 days on personal devices, is a valid and sensitive marker of memory decline in this
representative population and whether repeating a PLC every 6 months for 12 months will reveal AD-relevant
longitudinal cognitive decline. In exploratory analyses, we will examine PLCs in relation to cardiovascular risk
factors (e.g., systolic blood pressure, white matter hyperintensities via Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging) and
non-specific markers of neurodegeneration (e.g., entorhinal tau, hippocampal atrophy). If successful, this
proposal will provide a rapidly obtainable, repeatable, high-resolution snapshot of clinically relevant memory
failures to facilitate early detection of cognitive decline as well as provide a novel method to assess treatment
response more rapidly. Doing so in a representative population will ensure that the most promising novel and
accessible digital cognitive tools are generalizable to the broader at-risk population."

The goal of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Network (BMT CTN) is to generate efficacy and
safety data from multicenter Phase II and III trials, and advance the science and technology of immune and

leadership, expertise in research conduct, and robust clinical volumes to support the mission of the BMT CTN.
We also submit a project to specifically address major knowledge gaps in the domain of CAR-T therapy,
namely the optimal lymphodepleting chemotherapy approach. We propose a national randomized phase II trial
to identify an alternative lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LD-chemo) approach that optimizes efficacy and
safety in the setting of CD19 CAR-T therapy for large B cell lymphoma (utilizing two approved, commercially
available products, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel). The study arms
include 1) fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy) with fludarabine dosing optimized using mathematical
modeling of fludarabine exposure, 2) Bendamustine (Benda), and 3) Cladribine/Cy (Clad/Cy). Each of these
approaches has been studied in single center series and have evidence in support of improved outcomes. Our
proposed trial will for the first time prospectively test these regimens to determine which outperforms traditional
Flu/Cy for efficacy (12 month progression-free survival) and toxicity (composite severe toxicity endpoint
inclusive of grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune cell therapy associated
neurologic toxicity (ICANS), day 30 severe cytopenias, and severe infection). In parallel, we will interrogate the
biologic differences in immune cells and homeostatic cytokines in each study arm and correlate these findings
with clinical outcomes. This highly innovative trial has major potential to determine which of these LD-chemo
approaches optimizes outcomes, and will inform selection of an approach to be tested in a subsequent
randomized phase III trial against conventional standard of care Flu/Cy. The findings will have major impact on
clinical practice, the current state of the science, and potential to directly improve patient outcomes."
10954688,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), with a
case fatality rate of 30-50%. CAA is characterized by aggregation of likely misfolded deposits of amyloid β (Aβ)
in the cerebral vasculature, leading to vascular weakening and repeated, unprovoked ICH. Over the past decade
evidence has been accumulating that Aβ exhibits prion-like properties, being overtly transmissible in
experimental settings through a range of different parenteral routes. More pressingly, still, parenteral iatrogenic
Aβ transmissibility, leading to CAA development, has also been demonstrated in humans, following neurosurgery
and in patients treated with cadaveric human growth hormone. Given that prions are readily transfusion
transmissible, this raises the disconcerting possibility that CAA and its related Aβ-associated conditions, are
potentially transfusion transmissible. A large, bi-national, retrospective cohort study using the Swedish-Danish
SCANDAT transfusion database found that 0.1% of transfused patients in Sweden and Denmark received red-
cell units from blood donors who later suffered repeated, unprovoked ICH, and that these patients were at a
near-3-fold increased risk of themselves suffering an unprovoked ICH, as compared to patients who did not
receive red-cell units from affected blood donors. Under the hypothesis that the observed association was driven
by Aβ transmission and CAA development in affected donors and recipients, the clinical implications could be
very large, especially considering that Aβ aggregation is also strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
However, external replication of these preliminary findings, ideally with biochemical and mechanistic
corroboration, is urgently needed. We therefore propose to utilize the existing NHLBI REDS Allogeneic Donor
and Recipient (RADAR) repository, with samples from both blood donors and pre- and post- transfusion samples
of transfused, to (a) investigate the prevalence of Amyloid β pathology through measures of the associated
pTau217 protein among blood donors, and (b) investigate the possibility that amyloid β is transfusion-
transmissible from affected donors to their transfused patients."
10940242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play important roles in gene expression regulation and are associated
with numerous human diseases. Translated uORFs serve two major inhibitory functions: one is reducing
mRNA stability, presumably through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), and the other is repressing the
translation of the downstream main ORFs (mORFs), both leading to decreased protein levels. Despite their
significance, our understanding of uORF regulation remains limited. To understand the mechanisms of uORF
regulation, we will combine high-throughput sequencing, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and machine-
learning models to identify and characterize uORF features and regulation using the tractable model
Arabidopsis, which enables in vivo and whole-organism level studies. In the next five years, we will address
three important questions about uORFs: (1) Does NMD control uORF-containing mRNAs? Through systematic
profiling of translated uORFs, we have made surprising discoveries: NMD appears not to regulate most
Arabidopsis uORF mRNAs, even though Arabidopsis uORFs repress mORF translation and reduce protein
levels like in other eukaryotes. This unexpected finding raises the possibility that plant uORFs either
systematically escape NMD, or trigger NMD but are compensated through alternative mechanisms. Addressing
this question is important because aberrant mRNAs in various human diseases evade NMD via unknown
mechanisms. (2) How do certain mRNAs overcome uORF repression through 'reinitiation' after uORF
translation? Reinitiation is poorly understood due to the lack of a robust in vivo system. A key regulator of
reinitiation in Arabidopsis is TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR), a conserved master regulator of translation and
growth. In Arabidopsis, activated TOR leads to the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF3h,
promoting the reinitiation of several uORF-containing mRNAs crucial for development and metabolism. We will
leverage this TOR-mediated eIF3h phosphorylation system to study genome-wide reinitiation in vivo at the
whole-organism level and connect it to potential cis- and trans-regulation. (3) What uORF features control its
regulation in mRNA decay, translational repression, and reinitiation? We will integrate the genome-scale
datasets generated in this study with machine-learning models to quantify uORF characteristics influencing
protein production at multiple levels. Collectively, this research will enable us to 1) determine the relationship
between uORF translation and NMD, 2) investigate genome-wide reinitiation regulated by TOR-mediated
eIF3h phosphorylation, and 3) identify which uORF features impact mRNA stability and translation. This work
will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dual regulation of uORFs. Our long-term vision is to develop
Arabidopsis as a model system to identify both the divergent and conserved principles governing gene
regulation through uORFs and provide insights into potential innovative therapies for human health."

Designer small molecules and nucleic acid polymers are essential to the advancement of biotechnology and
precision medicine. However, efforts to develop such molecules with therapeutic potential face significant
challenges with regard to target selectivity, efficacy, and biostability. These challenges present critical barriers
to progress in clinical applications. Our long-term goal is to address these challenges by combining synthetic
organic chemistry and nucleic acid engineering toward sophisticated molecular designs as modulators of
disease-related targets or pathways. To achieve our goal, we propose the following research programs in this
MIRA application: 1) We will develop novel ligand-heterocycle conjugates as high-performing targeted RNA
degraders. These conjugates will exhibit rapid RNA degradation kinetics along with excellent selectivity for
G-quadruplexes found in RNAs associated with cancer; 2) We will engineer nucleic acid polymers with
(thio)phosphoramidate backbones that can serve as biostable mimics of RNA-cleaving ribozymes. In addition,
we will develop cyclic (thio)phosphoramidate dinucleotides as biostable agonists of the cGAS–STING
pathway, a critical mediator of inflammation; and 3) We will enhance the therapeutic potentials of nucleic acid
catalysts (NAzymes) by introducing programmable RNA cleavage functionality. Trans-acting NAzymes that
cleave RNA targets will be selectively activated by biochemical agents prevalent in disease conditions,
reducing damage to healthy cells. Realization of the proposed design principles will help advance the field of
nucleic acid therapy and drug development efforts geared toward precision medicine. The proposed research
projects will establish a foundation for promoting diversity and inclusivity, with opportunities for cross-
institutional collaborations and professional development."

Morphogenesis of biological tissue is a rich and complex process in which coordinated interplay between molecular and
mechanical stimuli progressively shapes an organism. Successful orchestration of this process enables an organism to
develop from a single cell into complex arrangements of tissues and organs comprising up to trillions of cells. Optical
imaging has emerged as a tool of fundamental importance in studying morphogenesis. Compared to other imaging
techniques used to study morphogenesis, such as X-ray or magnetic-resonance imaging, optical imaging enables non-
ionized live imaging of biological samples with sub-micron resolutions, morphological and molecular-specific contrast, and
high-speed data capture. Unfortunately, optical imaging within biological tissue is limited by optical scattering. Classical
microscopes form images by focusing unscattered light, and achieve imaging depths up to hundreds of microns in tissue.
Confocal and multiphoton microscopes achieve longer imaging depths by selectively illuminating and/or detecting only
with the unscattered component of the total light, which is detectable up to ~1 mm within biological tissue.
 Unfortunately, light from longer depths is dominated by scattering, which scrambles sample-specific information
and is generally considered unusable. This is a major obstacle for imaging tissue morphogenesis within developing
organisms, many of which reach sizes up to multiple millimeters during their developmental cycle. Recent optical imaging
technologies such as adaptive optics have demonstrated promising results in correcting for tissue scattering to achieve
enhanced imaging depths – however, they are still limited to small fields-of-view and are generally not suitable for imaging
3D morphogenesis across whole organisms composed with dense heterogenous tissue.
 We aim to establish a research program that develops computational microscopy technologies that overcome the
challenge of tissue scattering, to achieve large-scale 3D imaging of tissue morphogenesis. To accomplish this, our major
research thrusts will be to (1) develop computational scattering models that describes how light travels through scattering
tissue. These models will be used with gradient-based inverse-solvers to reconstruct the scattering sample’s 3D refractive-
index and fluorescent distributions, enabling joint morphological and molecular imaging, respectively; (2) design
multimodal optical hardware systems that combine refractive-index tomography with wavefront-shaped fluorescent
scattering tomography, to enable 3D co-registered morphological and molecular imaging. These systems will be designed
to achieve millimeter-scale fields-of-view with micron-scale resolution, to enable visualization of entire embryos with
subcellular resolution; and (3) apply our computational imaging developments to study in-vivo deep-tissue morphogenetic
processes. Specifically, we will quantitatively and at whole-organism scales study the interplay between collective cell
movements and the planar cell polarity signaling pathway in early-stage Zebrafish and Xenopus embryos, which is
recognized to be significant, but remains poorly understood."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and biochemical functioning of
neuronal tissues. Within the retina, a specific ECM known as the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) interfaces
photoreceptors with the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), implying a significant role in key processes such as
nutrient transport, the visual cycle, and phagocytosis of outer segments. Mutations affecting the IPM lead to
blinding diseases; however, the specific role of the IPM in retina homeostasis and blinding diseases remains
elusive. This project explores the function of two functionally interdependent proteoglycans, IMPG1 and IMPG2,
within the IPM and how mutations in these molecules are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Specifically,
we propose three comprehensive aims: AIM 1. Investigate IMPG1/2 role in the retina-RPE nutrient exchange.
Using an IMPG1/2-double knockout mouse model, this aim will test how IMPG1/2 facilitates the nutrient
interchange between the retina and RPE and its link to adult-onset RP. Fluorescent and 13C6-glucose probes will
be used to assess the nutrient flux between RPE and photoreceptors. AIM 2. Determine the mechanisms that
lead to childhood-onset RP linked to IMPG2 mutations. Employing newly developed mouse models based on
human disease, the study will elucidate the role of truncated IMPG2 proteins in accelerating the onset of RP and
test gene therapy strategies. AIM 3. Identify the cause of RP linked to IMPG1 mutations. This aim proposes that
mutations affecting the standard proteolysis of IMPG1 lead to intracellular protein accumulation and rod
degeneration. A new mouse model, IMPG1-L583P, will be employed to test this hypothesis and treatment
strategies. This research project seeks to delineate the role of IPM in retina homeostasis and unravel the
mechanisms of RP disease linked to IMPG1 and IMPG2 mutations. Furthermore, this project uses new mouse
models based on human diseases to test therapeutic approaches. Understanding the role of ECMs on the
neuron-glia interaction holds significant potential to comprehend a broad spectrum of neuronal and retinal
diseases and identify novel therapeutic avenues."

Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma (tRCC) represents a rare subtype of kidney cancer associated with
aggressive behavior and poor clinical outcome. The prevalence of this disease is high in pediatric kidney
cancer, representing 20-40% of total cases of RCC. Noteworthy, the true incidence of this disease in adults
is likely underestimated, as a significant number of patients undergoes histological misclassification. TRCC is
characterized by gene fusions resulting from chromosomal rearrangement involving TFE3 (Xp11.2) locus or
TFEB (6p21 locus), with various partner genes. Despite the identification of multiple TFE3 gene fusions in
tRCC (i.e. SFPQ-TFE3, NONO-TFE3, and PRCC-TFE3) there are no effective targeted therapies for patients
with tRCC. In preliminary results supported by the DOD (W81XWH1810586), our group has generated SFPQ-
TFE3, NONO-TFE3, and PRCC-TFE3 TFE3-Os and established their oncogenic potential. Knocking down
TFE3-wild type or full length (TFE3-wt) inhibited the proliferation of tRCC. By using Fluorescence Resonance
Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy imaging our data suggest that TFE3-Os dimerize TFE3-wt and screened
compounds have anti-proliferative effect by inhibiting this protein-protein interaction. Thus, this proposal aims
to identify small molecules that selectively bind the leucine zipper domain and disrupt the TFE3-Os/TFE3
interaction. Our central hypothesis is that TFE3 chimeric proteins (TFE3-Os) play a key biological role in
translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) and represent a rational target for therapeutic interventions. Our
hypothesis is that inhibiting the protein-protein homo and/or hetero dimerization of TFE3-Os/TFE3-wt may
offer a novel therapeutic opportunity. Our central hypothesis aims to accomplish the objectives of this
application by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To optimize tool compounds and to identify new
small molecule inhibitors targeting TFE3-O dimerization. Aim 2: To test the biological and antitumor effects
of new small molecule inhibitors targeting TFE3-O dimerization. Aim 1 proposes to optimize lead
compound recently identified in our lab, terfernadine and its metabolite fexofenadine. It will also screen for
novel compounds targeting TFE3 dimers with a customized cell-based antiproliferation assay that
simultaneously monitors TFE3 dimerization status through FRET. Validated hit molecules comprising
synthetically tractable scaffolds will be subject to medicinal chemistry optimization for structure-activity
relationship, lipophilicity, oral bioavailability and other essential properties. To accelerate the generation of
compounds for biological testing, our aim is to employ computer-aided docking of lead compounds with
relevant human TFE3 homology models for focused rational drug design. Aim 2 will utilize our established in
vitro models to determine the antitumor effect of the optimized tool compounds identified in Aim 1 which
disrupt TFE3-Os protein-protein interaction. This aim will then determine the antitumor effect of the leading
compounds, as single agents and in rational combinations."

Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMVD), defined as disease of the coronary pre-arterioles, arterioles, and
capillaries, accounts for 30-50% of the burden of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD). However, little is known about
the pathogenesis and there are no targeted therapies. Friend of Gata 2 (FOG2) is a cardiomyocyte
transcriptional co-regulator which is crucial for both the development and maintenance of the coronary
microvasculature. FOG2 promotes expression of angiogenic genes and inhibits expression of anti-angiogenic
genes, however, there are two predominant isoforms of FOG2, and the mechanism by which FOG2 promotes
an angiogenic program is not known. Our central hypothesis that cardiomyocyte FOG2S is the isoform which
regulates a pro-angiogenic gene program to support coronary microvasculature, via interactions with HIF1a.
Our objectives in this proposal are to define the structure-function relationship of FOG2 isoforms and HIF1a
and establish the paracrine effects of cardiomyocyte FOG2 and FOG2S on heterotypic vascular cells
phenotypes, as outlined in the following two aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the structure-function
relationship between FOG2 and HIF1a using co-immunoprecipitations studies and luciferase constructs for
angiogenic gene promoters. We will also establish the genome-wide cistrome of FOG2 isoforms. In Aim 2, we
will determine the paracrine effects of cardiomyocyte FOG2S on vascular cells in vivo and in vitro. First we use
a new isoform-specific inducible knockdown model we have developed to define the role of FOG2S in
maintaining the coronary microcirculation in vivo. We then establish the ability of cardiomyocyte FOG2S, as
opposed to FOG2, to regulate endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenic
potential. Our studies will provide novel insight into mechanisms of coronary microvascular homeostasis. The
proposal's outcomes will fill a critical gap in understanding the molecular factors maintaining the coronary
microvasculature and shed light on mechanisms relevant to a significant portion of IHD."

 The broad objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanism of homologous
recombination (HR) in humans, and to understand how the consequences of defects in recombinational DNA
repair result in chromosomal instability that underlie the predisposition to cancers. The proteins involved in a
central step of HR, DNA pairing, include RAD51, BRCA2, and the RAD51 paralogs, RAD51B, RAD51C,
RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. Mutations in these proteins are known to predispose individuals to cancer. The
objective is to understand the functions of these proteins in genome maintenance via recombinational DNA
repair, and how these proteins mediate and potentiate homologous DNA pairing by RAD51. We propose to
understand their mechanisms of action through biochemical analyses of reconstituted reactions using purified
proteins; characterization of defective mutant proteins identified in the patient population, and by visualizing the
individual behavior of these proteins acting on single molecules of DNA. The Specific Aims are to understand
the molecular functions of BRCA2 protein and to determine the functions of the RAD51 paralogs in RAD51
filament formation and RAD51-dependent DNA pairing."

The long-term objective of this research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling
in neurons intimately linked to neural health and function. In this project, our particular emphasis is on uncovering
the structural and molecular foundations underlying Ca2+ signaling at specialized membrane contact sites
between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. These ER-mitochondria contacts (ERMCs) are
hotspots for Ca2+-transport from the ER, the cell’s major Ca2+ storage organelle, to mitochondria. Inositol 1,4 5-
trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are the most widely expressed Ca2+ release channels residing in the ER
membranes and are essential components of ERMCs, participating in both membrane tethering and as a Ca2+
transport system that is activated by IP3 to liberate Ca2+ sequestered in ER stores. IP3Rs serve as scaffolds at
these ERMCs, where they interact with other proteins and form multiprotein complexes, responsible for the
precise regulation of Ca2+ signaling in response to various extracellular and intracellular signals. This regulation
is crucial for many cellular processes, including cell signaling, metabolism, and apoptosis. Emerging evidence
suggests that functional IP3Rs cluster within ER membranes, and this spatial organization ensures that Ca2+
release is appropriately coordinated and tailored to specific cellular needs. Dysregulation of IP3Rs or loss of
IP3Rs by knockout have been reported to reduce the ERMCs that leads to pathological conditions by either an
exaggerated cell death, as in neurodegenerative diseases, or escape from cell death as in some types of cancer.
Despite the rapid progress carried out in recent years, the structural basis and molecular mechanisms underlying
protein-protein interactions at ER-mitochondrial membrane contacts remain largely obscure. The lack of any
satisfactory explanation for how IP3Rs are assembled into clusters and communicate with other organelles
highlights the urgent need to structurally characterize the subcellular geography of IP3Rs and their interactions
with mitochondria. In this project to address this long-standing conundrum, we will utilize cutting-edge cryogenic
electron tomography (cryoET) to study frozen-hydrated IP3R complexes within ER-mitochondrial membrane
junctions isolated from mouse brain (aim 1) and in situ within mammalian cells expressing recombinant IP3Rs as
well as in native neurons cultured on EM grids (aim 2). To accomplish these studies, we endeavor to develop an
experimental workflow for in situ cryoET analysis that will have broad applicability to studies of other subcellular
macromolecular complexes. The proposed work is highly important as it will shed light on the complex network
of IP3R molecular interactions within neurons, with implications for a wide range of biological processes and
diseases. Anticipated structural and molecular insights will serve as a platform for the development of potential
therapeutic approaches to restore normal organelle membrane contacts to improve neuronal functions."

Psychotic disorders are serious and debilitating mental illnesses that incur substantial suffering for patients
and present major challenges to our health care system. Difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., the ability to
control the emotion response using strategies) significantly predict the development and maintenance of
psychotic symptoms and poor community-based functional outcomes. Recent neuroimaging research indicates
that hypofrontality may underlie these deficits. Unfortunately, there is no accepted technique for remediating
these emotion regulation abnormalities in psychotic disorders. Recent advances from the field of cognitive
neuroscience provide hope for a resolution to this critical unmet need in psychotic disorder therapeutics,
demonstrating that brief computerized cognitive training interventions are capable of improving emotion
regulation ability by targeting neural activation in the prefrontal cortex. The goal of the proposed project is to
determine whether an emotional working memory (eWM) cognitive training program is effective for
remediating emotion regulation abnormalities and associated clinical outcomes in people with psychotic
disorders. In the R61 phase, outpatients with psychotic disorders will be randomly assigned to either an eWM
(n = 20) or placebo (P: n = 20) cognitive training control intervention delivered via an app on a smartphone for
20 days. The primary aim of the R61 phase is to determine whether the eWM intervention successfully engages
the target mechanism and enhances prefrontal activation on a non-trained emotion regulation transfer task
beyond a pre-specified effect size criterion. Results of the R61 will also be used to determine the treatment
modality (i.e., audio-only, visual-only, or combined audio-visual) and duration (10 vs. 20 days) that most
effectively and efficiently improves the target. The goal of the R33 is to conduct an initial randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of the optimal treatment identified in the R61. The R33 specific aims are to: 1) replicate
and extend the R61 results supporting prefrontal target engagement in an adequately powered RCT (n = 80, 40
eWM, 40 P training); 2) determine if target engagement is associated with a proximal outcome of improved
real-world emotion regulation ability (indexed via computational modeling of ecological momentary
assessment data) and distal clinical outcomes of improved positive symptoms, negative symptoms, functional
outcome, and neurocognition. If the R33 hypotheses are confirmed, results will inform the design of a later
RCT for the early stages of psychosis, and to move toward a precision medicine approach that identifies which
individuals are most likely to benefit from the intervention."

Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) extensively self-renew to maintain the pool of HSCs for a lifelong
blood production and differentiate to generate all mature blood cells. Self-renewing LT-HSCs regenerate the
adult blood systems after transplantation, which is a curative therapy for many diseases, including
immunodeficiencies and leukemias. In addition, gene therapies with engineered HSCs are adopted as curative
therapies for an increasing number of diseases, such as sickle cell disease, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmunity,
and inheritable genetic disorders. Enhancing the efficiency of HSC ex vivo expansion and preserving HSC
reconstitution capacity after ex vivo expansion has broad therapeutic implications. However, in vitro culture of
LT-HSC has been limited by a loss of functional stem cells over time. This functional decline is at least partially
due to the dysregulation of proteostasis in cultured HSCs. There is growing evidence that dysregulated protein
homeostasis is associated with HSC exhaustion in ex vivo culture. Endoplasmic reticulum associated
degradation (ERAD) is a critical component of protein homeostasis, to ensure protein quality control by degrading
inappropriately folded or assembled proteins in ER. ERAD complexes recognize misfolded secretory and
membrane proteins in ER and dislocate them to cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Our recent studies show
that ERAD genes are enriched in quiescent and metabolically inactive HSCs as compared to proliferative and
activated HSCs. Furthermore, ERAD deficiency via knockout of Sel1L, an important component of the
Sel1L/Hrd1 ERAD complex, leads to hyperproliferation of HSCs that results in loss of HSC reconstituting capacity
and depletion of HSCs. Importantly, we observed decreased Se1L expression and accumulation of the ERAD
substrate after HSC culture, suggesting ERAD activity is decreased in cultured HSC. ERAD deficiency via Sel1L
knockout leads to a decrease of the number of HSCs after in vitro culturing and enhancing ERAD via
overexpression of Sel1L increased HSC expansion after ex vivo culture, supporting the hypothesis that ERAD
promotes HSC ex vivo expansion. To identify small molecular compounds that activate ERAD activity, we have
designed and optimized high throughput cell-based screening system using an ERAD activity reporter and
preliminary screening of the FDA repurposing library resulted in 4 chemicals that increase ERAD activity. All 4
compounds are HSP90 inhibitors, some of which have been previously shown to enhance HSC ex vivo
expansion, providing evidence that enhancing ERAD may promote HSC ex vivo expansion. Here we propose
studies to identify modulators of ERAD activity via a novel small molecular compound library and test the
hypothesis that loss of ERAD activity is associated with the loss of functional HSC in ex vivo culture systems
and that restoring ERAD function will improve HSC maintenance in culture and function following transplantation.
Our long-term goal is to improve culture methods for the clinical utilization of HSC in cellular and targeted gene
therapies."

A total of 11.8 million children live in rural areas of the United States, and one-quarter of these children have
chronic health conditions. This population is more likely to have disabilities, less likely to receive preventative
care, and more likely to report unmet healthcare needs than children who live in urban areas. As such, they
represent an underserved group at high risk for disparities in health outcomes. Children with complex or
disabling health conditions may be at particular risk of adverse outcomes when they live in rural areas due to
their chronic and multifaceted healthcare needs. However, at a population level we know extremely little about
how urban-rural disparities in health care access impact this vulnerable population. The overall objective of this
proposal is to comprehensively evaluate urban-rural disparities in health care utilization and quality for children
with complex or disabling health conditions using five years of all-payer claims data from three states:
Colorado, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. These states represent diverse populations with respect to
geography, rurality, and race/ethnicity, making them ideally suited to the proposed analyses. We will conduct a
retrospective cohort study of approximately 140,000 children to: (i) identify urban-rural disparities in
ambulatory, emergency and inpatient healthcare utilization, (ii) characterize urban-rural disparities in
healthcare quality, (iii) identify community and health-system factors associated with urban-rural disparities in
healthcare quality, and (iv) construct patient-sharing networks among physicians who care for these children to
determine how patient-sharing networks differ between rural- and urban-residing children, and whether these
differences are associated with disparities in quality of care. Construction of physician patient-sharing networks
– that is, structural representations of relationships between physicians developed on the basis of shared
patients -– provides a systematic approach to identify relationships between physicians that exist outside of
formal organizational structures, which may be particularly relevant to children living in rural areas. In adult
populations, network characteristics have been associated with resource utilization, practice patterns, and
healthcare outcomes. However, this study will be the first to explore how physician networks differ between
urban- and rural-residing children, characterizing a modifiable health system factor that may be leveraged in
future work to reduce urban-rural disparities in their quality of care. This project will be conducted by a
multidisciplinary team with clinical expertise providing care for children with medical complexity, as well as
research expertise using all-payer claims data to evaluate healthcare quality and construct social networks.
This research will generate essential data to inform the subsequent implementation and evaluation of
interventions to reduce health disparities for rural-residing children with complex or disabling health conditions."

Reducing stigma to ensure viral load (VL) suppression for women with serious mental illness (SMI) and HIV is a
global priority, including in Botswana, where the intersectional stigma of SMI, HIV and womanhood is
marginalizing in ways that impede adherence to both psychiatric medications and antiretroviral therapy (ART),
which can threaten VL suppression. We apply our novel ‘what matters most’ (WMM) approach to target
intersectional stigma faced by women with SMI and HIV in Botswana via a stigma-reduction intervention in the
high-risk transition period after discharge from an initial psychiatric hospitalization. WMM conceptualizes how
stigma is felt most acutely when people are unable to achieve ‘full personhood’ by participating in the activities
that ‘matter most’ in their local context. In prior research, we found the core value for ‘full womanhood’ in
Botswana is achieved by being the ‘foundation of the household’ and is threatened by perceived: 1)
incompetence in fulfilling the duties of a family caregiver associated with SMI and 2) promiscuity associated with
having HIV. In Botswana, family acceptance as a viable ‘family caregiver’ is also key to achieving ‘full status’ as
a woman. As such, the risks of being identified as having SMI and HIV (e.g., partner/family abandonment) can
deter psychiatric and ART treatment adherence. Promoting capabilities that ‘matter most’ for achieving ‘full
womanhood’ could enable longer-term stigma reduction after psychiatric discharge, when women are
reintegrating into their communities, and improve ART adherence and promote sustained VL suppression. Our
group-based WMM stigma intervention is co-led by a peer woman who has coped effectively with SMI and HIV
stigma. The WMM stigma intervention model was piloted among pregnant women with HIV in Botswana with
promising reductions in stigma and depressive symptoms up to 4-months postpartum. We now test whether a
WMM intervention tailored for women with SMI and HIV will reduce intersectional stigma and facilitate VL
suppression. We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=180) with a 4-month follow-up to
compare the effectiveness of 1) WMM-based intersectional stigma intervention delivered as clients transition
from psychiatric hospitalization to outpatient care (‘WMM Stigma Intervention;’ n=90); and 2) attention control
following a similar format to isolate the effects of the intervention (n=90). Because family are commonly involved
in the care of people with SMI and face severe stigma, we propose a parallel, group stigma intervention among
family members, as addressing familial stigma could facilitate treatment adherence. Finally, because
intersectional stigma is reinforced at systemic levels, we seek to empower women with SMI and HIV to influence
structural change by coleading policymaker workshops to reduce stigma among policymakers and spur
policymakers to address the unique needs of women with SMI and HIV via future policies."
10945565,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Significance: To date, no targeted therapies exist that prevent or improve the outcomes of patients with
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Despite an increasing awareness of hyperoxia (HO)-induced lung
injury and low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (MVL) strategies, mortality rates have plateaued at 35-45%
causing 75,000 deaths/year, and suggesting that we may have maximized the therapeutic potential of these
standard interventions. Additionally, progress in this field is hindered by the technical difficulties in experimentally
replicating the inflammatory environment at the alveolar-capillary interface with current ARDS models. Therefore,
the identification of molecular targets, and the development of new therapeutic strategies and improved ARDS
models represents a high priority topic with substantial impact in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
 In search for new therapeutic approaches, the Schwingshackl laboratory discovered epithelial TREK-1 K+
channels as key regulators of alveolar inflammation using simple, one-hit HO- and Influenza-A virus (IAV)-
induced lung injury models. However, the importance and protective potential of TREK-1 K+ channels in clinically
more relevant triple hit (IAV+HO+MVL) ARDS models remains unknown.
 To bridge these knowledge gaps and advance the field in a new direction, based on strong and exciting new
preliminary data the authors now hypothesize that (i) ARDS decreases epithelial and endothelial TREK-1 levels,
which causes cell membrane depolarization and subsequently promotes Ca2+-dependent alveolar inflammation,
and (ii) this injurious cascade can be counteracted by activation of the subset of residual TREK-1 channels.
 Using IAV as the most common ARDS trigger worldwide (besides SARS-CoV-2), and clinically-relevant HO
and MVL strategies, Aim 1 will investigate whether IAV, alone and combined with HO/MVL, decreases epithelial
and endothelial TREK-1 levels, and thus accelerates further lung injury. Aim 2 will determine whether activation
of the subset of residual TREK-1 channels can protect against IAV-induced ARDS. Aim 3 will establish the
molecular signaling mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks underlying TREK-1-mediated
protection, by using high-throughput electrophysiological approaches and precision medicine Functional
Enrichment Analysis tools, to ultimately facilitate rational drug design. For these studies, the authors will utilize
novel and complementary pharmacological and genetic loss- and gain-of-function approaches, including newly-
developed TREK-1 activating compounds (ML335, ML6733, BL1249), targeted cell type-specific TREK-1
overexpressing and TREK-1 KO mouse models, primary human alveolar epithelial/endothelial cells and lung
tissue, and two next-generation experimental ARDS models (Bioreactor; modified microfluidic SynVivo platform).
 Potential for high Impact: (i) Establish aberrant TREK-1 signaling as an unrecognized pathway in ARDS;
(ii) highlight TREK-1 activation as a novel therapeutic target for rational drug design; (iii) introduce two novel
experimental ARDS models to study injurious events at the notoriously challenging alveolar-capillary interface."

rates 65% higher than Caucasian (CA) women. The mechanisms underlying the heightened aggressiveness
and metastasis in AA TNBC remain elusive. This study investigates the immune suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) as a driving factor in AA TNBC progression. Specifically, it delves into the novel role
of the S100A7 and its interplay with intrinsic IFNγ signaling, elucidating their impact on TNBC aggressiveness
and metastasis in AA women. Our recent findings reveal elevated S100A7 expression in AA TNBC patient
samples and cell lines relative to CA counterparts. Moreover, higher S100A7 expression correlates with
increased tumor burden in various pre-clinical models, including AA TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX).
We also noted that S100A7 knockout (KO) mouse models (generated in our lab) exhibit reduced tumor burden,
while treatment with a novel S100A7-neutralizing antibody (nAb) shows promising efficacy in inhibiting TNBC
growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, S100A7 is demonstrated to enhance cPLA2/PGE2/IFNGR1 signaling
in AA TNBC cells, modulating intrinsic IFNγ signaling. This process generates an immune suppressive TME by
upregulating PD-L1 and downregulating Fas on tumor cells. Additionally, AA TNBC tumor tissues manifest
heightened immunosuppression, characterized by increased PD-L1 expression and infiltration of FoxP3+ Treg
cells. Our proposed research aims to meticulously uncover how S100A7 orchestrates IFNγ responsive genes
(PD-L1 and Fas) to generate an immunosuppressive TME in AA TNBC. This investigation leverages diverse
AA TNBC cell lines, humanized PDX models, and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
overexpressing mS100a7, mS100a7 KO, and the S100A7 nAb. The study's overarching hypothesis posits
that S100A7 contributes to AA TNBC aggressiveness by fostering an immunosuppressive and immune evasive
TME via regulating intrinsic IFNγ signaling, resulting in PD-L1 upregulation and Fas downregulation. The
research strategy encompasses three key aims: Aim 1 will elucidate how S100A7 signaling regulates IFNγ
responsive genes in AA TNBC using AA TNBC cells and mS100a7 GEMMs. Aim 2 will determine the novel
role of S100A7 in regulating macrophage plasticity, T cell function, and Fas-mediated immune evasion in AA
TNBC. Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of S100A7 nAb in combination with chemo or
immunotherapy using AA TNBC PDOs and PDX mouse models. This aim will also determine the prognostic
significance of S100A7 and its downstream signaling molecules in AA TNBC. In addition, this aim will establish
the association of S100A7 and various immune cells in TNBC racial disparity. The insights gained are poised
to identify novel S100A7-mediated downstream signaling pathways and determine the clinical relevance of
S100A7 in AA TNBC. This study holds the immense potential to inform the design of innovative therapeutic

with >800,000 people suffering from myocardial infarction each year. Human pluripotent stem cell derived
cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) hold remarkable promise for treating infarcted hearts. To accelerate clinical
translation of hPSC-CMs, our lab developed nanowired human cardiac organoids composed of hPSC-CMs,
human cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, stromal cells, and electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-
SiNWs). Our in vivo data showed that the organoids with/without e-SiNWs (1E6: 1x106 cells/rat) robustly
engrafted in Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) injured athymic rat hearts, with an engraftment rate of ~30% 1-week
post-implantation. The unwired organoids showed comparable functional recovery (~39% Fractional
Shortening (FS) recovery) to previous studies that injected 10-fold greater dissociated hPSC-CMs/rat (1E7
cells/rat). Further, the nanowired organoids illustrated superior functional recovery (~69% FS recovery).
Despite the progress, current cardiac organoids are prepared through spontaneous assembly of hPSC-CMs and
primary cells, leading to undefined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expressions and immune rejection after
implantation. To alleviate allogenic rejection, key genes involved in immune activation/suppression (e.g., B2M
necessary for HLA-A/B/C expression, HLA-E/CD47) have been knocked-out/in to hPSCs to derive
hypoimmunogenic hPSCs. Notably, islets derived from hypoimmunogenic hPSCs have been shown to effectively
evade host immune surveillance post-implantation and functionally recover diabetes in a humanized mouse
model. Unlike hypoimmunogenic hPSC islets, there have been few studies on the derivation and validation of
hypoimmunogenic hPSC cardiac cells to date. Further, effects of hypoimmunogenic gene editing on therapeutic
efficacies of hPSC cardiac cells have not been assessed. In addition, the effects of e-SiNWs on the
hypoimmunogenic cardiac cells has yet to be explored. The goal of the proposal is to test if hypoimmunogenic
gene editing of hPSCs will affect therapeutic efficacies of nanowired hPSC isogenic cardiac organoids. The
central hypotheses of the proposal are hypoimmunogenic gene editing does not significantly affect
therapeutic efficacy of nanowired cardiac organoids. The innovations of the proposal include, for the first
time, we will 1) determine the effects of hypoimmunogenic gene editing on structures/functions of hPSC cardiac
organoids, and 2) illustrate the synergy between biomaterials and hypoimmune on regenerative medicine.
Accordingly, we will pursue 3 Aims: 1) Determine the effects of hypoimmunogenic gene editing on hPSC cardiac
cells, 2) Determine the effects of e-SiNWs on hypoimmunogenic hPSC isogenic cardiac organoids, and 3)
Determine therapeutic efficacy and hypoimmunogenicity of the nanowired hPSC cardiac organoids optimized in
Aim 2 in vivo. The proposed studies will lay down the foundation to develop readily available, “off-the-shelf”
hPSC cardiac organoids to treat infarcted patients."

Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is pathogenic in autoimmune diseases such as
Inflammatory Arthritis (IA). IA affects more than 1% of the worldwide population and remains incurable to date1.
Ectopic IL17A expression in mice induces IA phenotype and provides a model to study mechanisms2. Activation
of IL-17A receptor (IL-17R) recruits a signaling complex consisting of Act1 and TRAFs (Tumor Necrosis Factor
Receptor Associated Factors). Activation of TRAF6 or TRAF2/5 results in transcriptional (IL6) and post-
transcriptional (CXCL1) outcomes of IL-17A cytokine. TRAFs often interact with each other and influence
signaling outcomes. The crosstalk between the TRAF6 and TRAF2/5 branches in IL-17A signaling remains
unknown. Our recent PNAS publications showed that 14-3-3z is a novel component of IL-17R signaling and
suppresses IA. In IL-17A signaling, 14-3-3z connects the two TRAF branches, inhibits TRAF5 but promotes
TRAF6. There are two motifs on 14-3-3z that interact and show specificity to TRAF5 and TRAF6 binding. We
also showed that TRAF5 inhibits TRAF6-dependent IL-17A signaling. Our new preliminary data show that 14-
3-3z modifies TRAFs and their interactions with other cellular proteins, thus providing clues to its mechanism.
Our long-term goal is to understand how 14-3-3z bridges TRAFs in IL-17R signaling and diseases. We
hypothesize that “14-3-3z has a dual role in IL-17 signaling by executing the opposing functions of TRAFs,
leading to the prevention of IA.” We propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms and physiological
relevance of the 14-3-3z-TRAF axis in regulating IL-17R signaling and inflammatory arthritis with three specific
aims. The first two aims will examine how 14-3-3z regulates TRAF5 and TRAF6 activity, connects two branches,
and gain an in-depth understanding of 14-3-3z’s function in IL-17R signaling. In the third aim, we will examine
the physiological relevance of the 14-3-3z-TRAF axis using an innovative IL-17A gene transfer model to study
14-3-3z role in chronic IL-17A and IA pathogenesis using 14-3-3z knockout animals. Successful completion of
this proposal will provide mechanistic insight into how 14-3-3z modifies TRAF proteins and their activity,
regulates IL-17R signaling, and suppresses IA. This study is innovative because by studying 14-3-3z’s role in
TRAF biology, we examine the molecular basis of a novel fundamental immune regulatory axis in IL-17R
signaling and IA. Our study is significant because understanding 14-3-3z action on TRAFs advances our
fundamental knowledge of protein biochemistry, immunology, IL-17R signaling, IA pathogenesis, and other
autoimmune diseases. IA is a challenging disease with limited therapeutic options; therefore, a deeper
understanding of IA pathogenesis is desired. And, as TRAFs play a critical role in many receptor signaling, the
implications of 14-3-3z functions go beyond IL-17R signaling to many other autoimmune and infectious
diseases."

The purpose of this proposal is to build on the foundation of the Fragile X Online Registry With
Accessible Research Database (FORWARD) and obtain more detailed longitudinal data
describing the phenotype of children and young adults with fragile X syndrome (FXS) in order to
better characterize the natural history of fragile X syndrome (FXS). A product of the study will be
to understand the longitudinal trajectory of meaningful outcomes that impact the lives of children
and adolescents with FXS with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and from different
racial/ethnic groups and geographic locations across the United States. The research will
characterize cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive skills, and other indicators of functioning of
individuals with FXS, and determine how these outcomes relate to diagnostic history, early
intervention, and access to services. Finally, this study will collect data to explore the practical,
financial, and psychological impact that caring for a family member with FXS has on caregivers
and siblings of those with FXS. Post-award, outcomes to be measured will be chosen in
coordination with CDC's Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) Follow-up Study (RFA-
DD-21-001) and will include standardized in-person behavioral and functional assessments and
follow-up computer-assisted telephone survey questionnaires. Data from this project and the
SEED project will be collected and housed in a secure electronic data system maintained at a
CDC-contracted organization. Outcomes chosen for study will facilitate comparison of health
and functional outcomes for the FXS population with those for other related and frequently co -
occurring conditions, such as ASD and developmental delay. Outcome data will assist with
identifying public health gaps affecting those with FXS, inform service delivery
recommendations and inform design of interventional studies, all with the goal of improving the
lives of those with FXS and their families."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the self-renewing, tissue-specific stem cells in vertebrates that regenerate definitive hematopoietic lineages over the life of the individual. HSC transplant is a major treatment modality for leukemia and some non-malignant hematologic diseases including sickle cell disease, as well as a platform for delivery of gene therapy. Understanding the complete set of normal signals involved in embryonic specification of HSCs remains elusive. To identify missing inputs, we have been investigating the endogenous hematopoietic “specification niche” at the cellular, genetic, molecular, and architectural levels. HSCs emerge from specialized arterial “hemogenic endothelium” found in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region of the developing embryo. Transcriptional profiling has identified ECM genes as among the most highly expressed in hematopoietic niches at all stages of HSC ontogeny including during specification, but no studies have examined the normal organization of the ECM in the specification niche or addressed whether normal ECM organization and maturation is required for HSC specification. ECM comprises a complex and dynamic macromolecular network of proteins and proteoglycans that provides structure and can regulate cellular survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Collagen is the major structural component of ECM. Our transcriptional profiling and network analysis of in vitro hematopoietic differentiation identified a collagen-modifying enzyme, procollagen-lysine, 2oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2), as a likely pivotal player in definitive hematopoietic emergence. We confirmed expression of Plod2 in the HSC specification niche of zebrafish and mouse and took advantage of antisense and genetic approaches to assess the effects of knockdown and loss-of-function during development. Our studies indicate Plod2 is required for HSC emergence in zebrafish and point to a conserved requirement in mammals. In the absence of Plod2, we observe diminished activity of Yap/Taz signaling, which is a mechanosensitive pathway responsive to ECM stiffness via integrin receptors. Our hypothesis is that ECM maturation/stiffening is an unrecognized input required for HSC specification. To test this hypothesis, we will interrogate ECM organization in the HSC specification niche, examine how PLOD2 contributes to niche architecture, and investigate a functional role for this enzyme in vertebrate HSC specification. Our studies are the first to examine a potential role for ECM in HSC specification in vivo."
10619109,"Understanding the process by which animals learn to perform specific actions from rewarding experiences is
important for identifying the neural and behavioral patterns that indicate system dysregulation; such knowledge
can help lead to the development of diagnostics and therapy for conditions where action learning is impaired.
Dopaminergic neurons and their targets have been implicated as major contributors to action learning. Though
it is well known that stimulation of dopaminergic neurons can reinforce behavior, it is less clear how stimulated
dopaminergic activities guide the animal to behaviorally search the world for the action that produces reward.
The goal of this proposal is to characterize the role of dopaminergic activity in shaping behavior that hones in
on a specific action or action sequences for reward. A key to this proposal is the combination of optogenetics
and objective, unsupervised behavioral clustering to develop a closed loop reinforcement system in which
reward in the form of dopaminergic stimulation is delivered to the VTA of animals as they learn to perform
specific actions or action sequences. The K99 phase of the application will involve characterization of the
behavioral patterns underlying single action and action sequence learning, followed by imaging of the
dorsolateral striatum (known to represent the action space) in freely moving mice to understand the neural
correlates of the action learning process. Functional circuit dissection will also be performed to elucidate which
specific VTA projection pathways mediate action learning. Following mastering of these techniques, the
applicant will enter the R00 phase and continue studying the role of specific VTA projection pathways on the
action learning process. Chemogenetics in combination with closed loop reinforcement will be performed to
dissect the pathways necessary for action learning. Neuronal activity imaging will then be performed on
dopaminergic targets found to be important for action learning. The training plan, under the joint mentorship of
Dr. Rui Costa and Dr. Stefano Fusi at Columbia University, will provide a complete set of neuroscience tools
and the necessary career development resources for the applicant to obtain a faculty position and start an
independent research program to explore the role of VTA dopaminergic neurons on the action learning
process."
10733028,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notoriously resistant to therapy and has a dismal 5-year survival
rate. Development of PDAC is accompanied by changes in stromal responses and immune surveillance
programs, which are now recognized as major drivers of PDAC tumor evolution and contribute to therapeutic
resistance. We have recently demonstrated that B cells expressing the immunomodulatory cytokine IL35 are
necessary to support the growth of PDAC in murine models. The overarching goals of this proposal are to
elucidate mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting effect of IL35 expression in B cells, and to investigate the
translational potential of targeting the IL35 pathway as a novel means to augment immunotherapy for this
disease. In Aim 1, we will define essential role for IL35 expressing B cells in establishing an immunosuppressive
microenvironment in PDAC using B cell specific knockout of IL35 and chimeric bone marrow reconstitution. In
Aim 2, we will clarify how B cell receptor (BCR) and CD40 signaling contribute to induction of IL35 expression in
tumor-reactive B cells. To accomplish this task, we will analyze mouse models expressing a fixed BCR with or
without antigen exposure, as well as mouse models lacking CD40 signaling in B cells. We will also perform
signaling pathway analysis in primary B cells and B cell lines. In Aim 3, we will assess the translational potential
of targeting pathogenic B cells in PDAC. Specifically, we will quantify, functionally characterize and study gene
expression signature of IL35+ B cell subset in blood and surgically resected tissues from patients with PDAC.
Additionally, we will evaluate anti-IL35 therapy in combination with immune checkpoint blockade as a novel
therapeutic strategy in syngeneic murine PDAC models. Our proposed research will provide an understanding
of a previously uncharacterized facet of B cell-mediated function in PDAC, use state-of-the-art PDAC murine
models to test strategies that block immune suppressive pathways in TME to enhance the impact of T cell-
reinvigorating therapies, and provide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of IL35+ B cells in human PDAC.
This project will expand our understanding of how IL35 shapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
and may inform the optimal design of B cell-directed immunotherapy strategies against pancreatic cancer."

Disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis (OA) remain a significant clinical challenge. Though numerous
promising drug candidates are discovered, they suffer from persistent delivery challenges. The timing and dosing
of multiple therapeutics targeting different disease mechanisms must be considered for effective management
of OA. Due to issues with joint bioavailability and systemic toxicity, most OA therapies are studied by direct
injections into affected joints. Intra-articular injections, however, require image-guidance and specialized
personnel, and carry a risk of mis-injection and tissue injury. As such, this approach is limited, especially for
repeat and/or timed treatments. Further, in patients with multi-joint disease, these intra-articular injections may
not be feasible or tolerable. In contrast, intravenous injections are relatively easier and cheaper to administer,
and are less painful and risky. However, to be successful, the drug must cross numerous physiological barriers
to localize to diseased OA joints and with minimal off-target or systemic effects. Towards this goal, this proposal
will identify peptides that preferentially localize to OA joints after intravenous injection, and leverage these
peptides in for the development of targeted OA drug carriers. Aim 1 will use an in vivo phage display to select
peptides that home to OA joints from the systemic circulation in an animal model of post-traumatic (PT) OA. In
Aim 2, we will attach the selected peptide(s) to nanoparticle drug carriers and evaluate their ability to target to
OA joints after intravenous injection. Nanoparticle tracking will be accomplished using conventional optical
imaging techniques, and an emerging imaging modality, Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) to enable robust and
quantitative assessment of nanoparticle biodistribution. Overall, this work will make important advances in
systemic delivery systems for OA, which are needed to expand clinical options for comprehensive, long-term
therapeutic strategies for OA."

The goal of the proposed research is to develop a bacterial vector to deliver oncolytic viruses (OVs). As
immunotherapies, OVs regress many cancers and have had clinical success treating externally accessible
tumors. Despite the promise of this approach, poor delivery limits the efficacy of OVs for treating internal solid
tumors. To address this issue, we developed virus-delivering Salmonella (VDS) to carry oncolytic viruses into
cancer cells in tumors. By specifically colonizing tumors, VDS protects the viral genome from clearance in the
blood and circumvents the difficulty of using OVs as immunotherapy for solid tumors.
We propose to deliver H-1 parvovirus (H-1PV) with VDS to prevent sequestration of viral particles in non-tumor
organs and increase delivery to tumors. We hypothesize that immunogenic cell death (ICD) caused by H-1PV
induces the production of cytokines, triggers immune cell infiltration, and generates memory CD8 T cells. This
newly formed antitumor immunity will eliminate cancer cells regardless of their location in the body. We have
established the foundation for this research by showing that (1) deletion of homologous recombination genes
(RecB, SbcB, SbcCD and RecF) from Salmonella preserves essential hairpins in the viral genome that are
required for formation and replication; (2) delivery of H-1PV to cancer cells with VDS produces functional viral
particles, and (3) the produced virus particles are infective and kill cancer cells.
The proposed research plan has two Aims that will (Aim 1) measure bacterial virus delivery to tumors in mice
and quantify tumor specificity, safety, and tissue amplification, and (Aim 2) quantify the induction of cytotoxic cell
death by VDS-H1PV and its generation of antitumor immune responses. We hypothesize that when administered
to mice, VDS-H1PV produces functional virions that spread throughout tumors by re-infecting neighboring cancer
cells. We will test this hypothesis by delivering VDS-H1PV to mice with murine hepatocellular carcinoma tumors
and measuring viral titers in tumors and healthy organs. We will also measure infiltration and activation of T cells,
dendritic cells, macrophages and NK cells. We anticipate that VDS-H1PV induces cancer cell death, reduces
tumor volume, generates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity, and prevents tumor re-implantation.
VDS has several distinct advantages over other therapeutic strategies. Compared to other cellular carriers, VDS
has a significantly higher therapeutic index and tumor accumulation is not rate limiting. VDS-H1PV also has
several advantages over other microbial therapies. It directs the immune induction of OV therapy specifically to
tumors and it is not dependent on the extent of bacterial colonization in tumors. Only a small number of bacteria
are required to initiate a tumor-localized infection that amplifies the therapeutic response. The combination of
targeted intracellular delivery with Salmonella and immune induction with H-1PV couples the advantages of both
systems."

The United States struggles to cultivate a biomedical research workforce that reflects the diversity of its
population. This challenge is particularly striking in the field of diabetes and metabolic disorders, which
disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Workforce
diversity is an important goal for social justice and contributes to organizational effectiveness through increased
creativity, broader foundations for decision-making, and a sense of inclusion and belonging in the workplace. In
the field of diabetes and metabolism, a diverse workforce is also critical for broadening participation in clinical

Post-bac Program in Diabetes and Metabolism to attract talented individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue
further training and ultimately, careers in biomedical research in metabolic diseases. This program will leverage
Joslin and BIDMC’s broad and deep expertise in diabetes and metabolism and a highly experienced cadre of
mentors who will provide participants with dedicated research experiences, mentoring, coursework, and
professional development activities. The overall goal of our program is to provide participants with the scientific,
technical, and professional skills they will need to pursue doctoral degrees and the inspiration to dedicate their
talents to prevention, treatment, and cure of diabetes and related metabolic disorders. To effectively identify
participants from diverse backgrounds, our program will partner with the Biomedical Sciences Career Program,
a Boston-based non-profit organization dedicated to providing mentorship and career development programs to
individuals from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds to promote their success in

Atherosclerosis is the major etiological process responsible for 25% of global deaths. Numerous reports
indicate both the adaptive and innate immune systems are involved in atherogenesis. In addition to well-
established risk factors such as age, hypertension, high circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and type 2 diabetes, the quality and quantity of sleep are now recognized as important factors for
atherogenesis. Sleep is vital for life. In the USA, ~70 million people report insufficient sleep and/or fragmented
sleep due to work responsibilities, sleep apnea, caregiving, and lifestyle choices. Changes in sleep are a part
of the normal aging process, leading to increased sleep fragmentation (SF), nighttime awakenings, and a
greater tendency for daytime sleep. Dysregulation of normal sleep negatively affects homeostatic functions and
is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis. Long-term SF may lead to
endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and altered vessel wall structure. SF has a negative impact on
atherogenesis through the regulation of myelopoiesis, highlighting the complex relationship between sleep, the
vascular system, and the immune system. One of the remaining outstanding questions in the field is the extent
to which SF affects the vulnerability of plaques. Another important question that remains to be investigated is
whether the restoration of sleep quality might reduce atherosclerosis development and improve the phenotype
of the plaques.
Our results indicate that SF supports neutrophil functions such as ROS and NET production. We detect
increased circulating levels of LPS that might serve as a neutrophil activator during SF. Competitive homing
experiments clearly demonstrated that SF directs neutrophil recruitment into the aorta. Importantly, neutrophil
depletion improves plaque phenotype of SF mice. One of the strongest phenotypes observed in the circulation
and the gut was a significant degree of oxidative stress, cell death, and neutrophil activation. Gut inflammation
was also supported by alterations in the intestinal immune composition. In this application, we propose the
hypothesis that disturbed sleep negatively influences gut-associated inflammation, triggering LPS-induced
oxidative stress, and activating neutrophils, which, in turn, plays a key role in the formation of accelerated
vulnerable plaques. Here, we propose to investigate the role of NADPH-dependent oxidative stress in
vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque formation in response to SF in HFD-fed via neutrophil or intestinal epithelial
cell-specific NADPH-deficient Apoe-/- mice (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will test to what extent restoring sleep quality
would improve the phenotype of atherosclerotic plaques and reduce atherogenesis. The findings from this
proposal could lead to the development of new treatments aimed at preventing gut-associated and neutrophil-
induced oxidative stress and suppressing accelerated atherogenesis induced by SF."

studies have shown that TLT-1 presents itself as a potential target to control thrombosis without
the introduction of bleeding. However, to pursue the therapeutic aspects of TLT-1, we must first
understand the mechanisms of TLT-1 function. This project is focused on identifying the critical
signaling motifs of TLT-1 function. To accomplish this goal, we have outlined two specific AIMs:
Aim 1: Characterize TLT-1 phosphorylation sites, Aim 2: Decipher the intracellular cues

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling continues to play a dominant role in all stages of prostate cancer
(PC), including castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs) that have developed resistance to
second generation of AR-antagonists e.g. enzalutamide. We identified a long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA), NXTAR (LOC105373241), located convergently to the AR gene that is repressed in human
prostate tumors and cell lines, and discovered that its reinstatement promotes binding upstream of
the AR promoter, causing significant loss of expression of AR and its splice variant AR-V7.
Paradoxically, AR binds to NXTAR promoter, and inhibition of AR by ACK1/TNK2 small molecule
inhibitor, (R)-9b, excluded AR from binding to NXTAR promoter. Consequently, histone
acetyltransferase GCN5 bound and deposited H3K14 acetylation marks enhancing NXTAR
expression. Translational relevance of the negative regulation of AR became apparent when an
oligonucleotide derived from NXTAR exon 5 (NXTAR-N5) suppressed AR/AR-V7 expression and
prostate cancer cells proliferation. In addition, pharmacological restoration of NXTAR using (R)-9b
abrogated enzalutamide-resistant prostate xenograft tumor growth. Overall, our study uncovers a
negative feed forward loop, wherein NXTAR acts as a novel prostate tumor-suppressing lncRNA by
inhibiting AR/AR-V7 expression, which in turn upregulates NXTAR levels, compromising
enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. The restoration of NXTAR could be a new therapeutic
modality for patients who have acquired resistance to second-generation AR-antagonists.
Based on these data we hypothesize that (i) the therapeutic oligonucleotide NXTAR-N5, or (ii) its
combination with the ACK1 inhibitor (R)-9b, or (iii) WEE1 inhibitor, AZD-1775 that restores NXTAR
levels could be new therapeutic modalities for patients who have acquired resistance to second-
generation AR-antagonists. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of NXTAR suppression in CRPCs.
Aim 2. Synthesis of PSMA targeted `Bivalent and Trivalent’ nanoparticles with NXTAR-N5 oligo, (R)-
9b or/and AZD-1775 inhibitor payloads.
Aim 3. In vivo characterization of Bi/Trivalent nanoparticles to overcome Enz-resistance in prostate
cancer models, and patient derived xenografts (PDXs)."
10974883,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to significant
breakthroughs in molecular structure modeling, particularly in accurately predicting protein structures.
However, the prediction of RNA tertiary structures faces challenges due to limited experimentally determined
RNA 3D structures and the absence of AI/ML-ready data for training advanced algorithms. The recent Critical
Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15) competition revealed that traditional motif-based
approaches outperform deep-learning-driven methods in RNA 3D structure modeling. Nevertheless, traditional
methods struggle when applied to RNA molecules not well-represented in their template libraries. To overcome
this limitation, there is a need to advance ML-driven RNA structure prediction methods that can effectively
capture the relationship between nucleotides and structural motifs using extensive RNA sequence data. The
integration of RNA motif-based features with advanced AI/ML algorithms shows promise in enhancing RNA
structural analysis and prediction accuracy. To facilitate this advancement, this proposal aims to develop an
automated RNA motif structure parsing pipeline that generates motif-based feature datasets, supporting AI and
ML-driven RNA structural analysis. This dataset will facilitate the training of cutting-edge ML algorithms and
enable diverse RNA structure analysis applications.
Specific objectives are:
Aim 1: To develop an automated motif-based feature generation framework for improved RNA structure
prediction with machine learning.
Aim 2: To develop open-source computational workflows for RNA structure analysis using the AI/ML-ready
features.
Aim 3: To enhance the sequence-structure relationships in full-length RNA folding using RNA motif features
with open-source AI/ML algorithms.
The proposed AI/ML-ready features will facilitate various computational workflows for RNA structural analysis,
including RNA motif clustering, the identification of RNA motif 3D interactions, and cryo-EM modeling for 3D
structure prediction. Additionally, this proposal will provide preprocessed datasets and ML pipelines on
platforms to encourage community engagement and collaborative research efforts. These initiatives will
strengthen the research and education environment at Saint Louis University, promoting interdisciplinary
collaboration and preparing students from diverse backgrounds to tackle future challenges in intelligent RNA
structure analysis. This research aligns with the mission of the NIH NIGMS and the objectives of the AREA
grant program by addressing the need for improved RNA structure prediction methods through AI and ML-
driven approaches, thereby offering valuable resources for research and education in this field."
10974947,"First line platinum-based chemotherapies kill cancer cells through formation of bulky DNA adducts, however,
these adducts also form in healthy tissues leading to side effects that significantly impact patients’ quality of life.
Post-therapy bone loss has been linked to chemotherapy-induced stem cell senescence, while neurotoxicity and
secondary tumors are linked to increased mutagenesis in stem cell DNA, ultimately forcing clinicians to use lower
doses that are less effective. Consequently, there is a need to improve DNA repair capacity in healthy cells
without compromising drug effectiveness on cancer cells. We propose to selectively increase nucleotide excision
repair (NER) of platinum-DNA adducts in healthy cells, while maintaining cancer cell killing efficacy, through the
application of passive mechanical stress via low intensity vibration (LIV). Not addressing this problem will
continue to decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy regimens and the quality of life for cancer survivors.
Our objective for this proposal is to determine whether LIV preferentially enhances NER capacity of platinum-
based DNA adducts in healthy cells, thus mitigating chemotherapeutic side-effects. The central hypothesis is
that LIV will upregulate NER in a LINC-dependent manner reducing platinum-based chemotherapy toxicity and
senescence in healthy stem cells. Further, cancer-associated downregulation and depletion of LINC complex
elements will reduce the effectiveness of LIV on NER. This hypothesis was formulated based on our preliminary
findings that cancer cells with reduced LINC complex expression fail to initiate LIV-induced mechanosignaling
and that LIV enhances NER of bulky UV-induced DNA adducts in healthy stem cells and loss of LINC complex
disrupts NER.
The aims of this study are to determine 1) LIV-induced changes in platinum toxicity in healthy, LINC-disabled
and cancer cells. 2) LINC-mediated alterations in chromatin dynamics and initiation of the DNA damage
response.
If successful, results from our R15 AREA proposal will yield a novel understanding of how external mechanical
force in the form of LIV is involved in DNA repair in a LINC complex dependent manner, potentially opening up
non-pharmacologic and targeted therapeutic interventions to decrease side effects and long-term sequelae
following chemotherapeutic treatment modalities. This research will improve undergraduate retention in the
biomedical workforce and give students an opportunity to continue their education in our department at Boise
State University, which offers the only Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. program in Idaho."

 GPR39 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by zinc (Zn2+) and implicated in several
neurodegenerative symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress,
microtubule destabilization, and tau phosphorylation. In AD brains, Zn2+ binding to amyloid beta (Aβ) disrupts
the zincergic GPR39 signaling cascade, leading to down regulation of critical neuroprotective pathways and
poor cognitive function. Targeting GPR39 agonists could inform development of novel drugs to ameliorate AD
symptoms, but we have no reliable, noninvasive methods to quantify GPR39 levels. This project will evaluate
the first positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to accurately measure GPR39 in vivo in rodent and
human brain tissues of AD. This PET imaging strategy will significantly advance our understanding of Zn2+
GPR39-mediated dyshomeostasis pathways in AD brains beyond, currently available through terminal ex vivo
studies. PET imaging of GPR39 will provide a valuable tool to assess the real-time distribution, target
engagement, and dose occupancy of novel GPR39 agonist drugs.
 Our group has developed [11C]TM-N1324, the first brain-penetrant, PET radiotracer for imaging GPR39
and tested it in rodents. The proposed proof-of-concept R21 project is designed to establish the efficacy of two
exciting approaches. First, we will investigate the imaging utility of [11C]TM-N1324 in two rodent models and
compare the results in (a) mice that overexpress or do not express GPR39 along age-matched healthy controls
(n=8/sex/group); and (b) Aβ-overexpressing APP/PS1 transgenic and age-matched wildtype littermates
(n=8/sex/group). We will correlate the PET outcome with associated GPR39 levels via western blot and Aβ
levels via immunohistochemical analyses. Second, we will characterize and evaluate binding and
pharmacokinetic parameters of [11C]TM-N1324 in the Aβ-overexpressing APP/PS1 transgenic and age-
matched wildtype mice and postmortem human AD and age-matched cognitively normal brain tissues
(n=8/sex/group) using biodistribution, autoradiography, and metabolite studies.
 The proposed project will be the first to systematically examine in vivo imaging of GPR39 in rodent

examining GPR39 modulations in AD pathogenesis and advance the therapeutic potential of GPR39 agonists
to ameliorate AD symptoms."
10974088,"An increasing body of data show the brain is a target of diabetes complications. We and others have investigated
the impact of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the developing brain in children as young as 4-years old. Using structural
and functional brain MRI, neurocognitive assessments, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) we observed
quantifiable differences in gray and white matter volume (and microstructure) in children with T1D compared to
age-matched nondiabetic controls, and meaningful differences in working memory, executive function scores,
and performance IQ. These differences widened when children were followed at 4-time points over nearly 8-
years, findings strongly correlated to hyperglycemia. This Funding Opportunity seeks to further investigate
neurocognitive and psychosocial function now in children with new onset diabetes, including those of diverse
racial and socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. This is timely given our preliminary data raise important questions
as to the impact of better normalization of blood glucose using advanced insulin delivery (AID)/closed-loop
systems. We propose an observational, longitudinal study in a large cohort of 4-10-year old prepubertal children
with new onset T1D (n=525) presenting with or without diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), studied within 4-6 weeks of
diagnosis, compared to age-matched nondiabetic controls (preferably siblings and classmates) (n=175).
Primary Aims: (1) To determine their neurocognitive function (principal); (2) To correlate neurocognitive
function scores with metrics of dysglycemia, and severity of diabetes and DKA at presentation; (3) To assess
patient/family reported perceptions of quality of life, including diabetes distress and psychosocial aspects, in
children, and mood in parents; (4) To correlate above AIMS with use of AID closed-loop technologies; (5) To
assess structural gray and white matter volume and white matter microstructure and functional (f)MRI during
cognitive tasks (baseline & 24-months). Pertinent social determinants of health (SDOH) will be collected, and all
outcomes adjusted by sex and SES and level of glycemia. To accomplish this, we will perform standardized
neurocognitive testing using NIH toolbox, psychosocial assessments, structural and functional MRI using
multimodal imaging, CGM downloads and HbA1c, SDOH data collected using NIH toolbox PhenX. Children will
be recruited across 10 centers selected along a Biostatistical Research Core, in a new network. Children with
T1D will be followed quarterly, CGM and pump (if applicable) data downloaded, principal assessments done at
baseline, 12 and 24-months. This principal investigator, and the experienced team assembled, would bring
considerable expertise and strength to the new network, with an outstanding record of accomplishments studying
T1D and the brain in children and well-established clinical and research infrastructure. This innovative proposal
is a prototype of the observational study we can perform. Results will offer critical insight on developmental and
cognitive trajectories in young children with new onset T1D, racially and socioeconomically diverse, and whether
better glycemic control, including early use of AID technology can prevent or improve cognitive outcomes."
10974782,"Abstract:
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a leading neurodegenerative disorder attributed to the abnormal folding and
aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in dopaminergic neurons. The exact causative mechanism, however,
remains unclear. Leveraging advanced techniques like scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and
surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM), our previous work elucidated how α-synuclein oligomers might
compromise neuronal membranes, while pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) primarily influence membrane roughness
without inducing significant cytotoxicity. This new phase aims to deepen our understanding by exploring the role
of phosphorylated α-syn (P-syn), a pathological variant of α-syn. The objectives include synthesizing and
characterizing P-syn, assessing its impact on neuronal membranes, and evaluating its influence on iron-driven
dopamine oxidation. Furthermore, we will investigate the role of environmental toxins, specifically nanoplastics,
in α-syn aggregation and its subsequent interactions with membranes. The outcomes from this research are
anticipated to shed light on the molecular intricacies of PD and potentially pave the way for targeted therapeutic
strategies."
10973811,"Background and Rationale: Asthma is a substantial public health problem with adolescents having substantial
asthma-related morbidity. Adolescence is a critical phase of transition to adulthood, marked by the
development of cognitive and autonomous skills required to assume greater responsibility for asthma care.
Asthma self-management, which plays a pivotal role in achieving asthma control, is suboptimal among
adolescents. Investigating asthma self-management behavior during this period is particularly crucial, to help
them manage their asthma. Despite this, there is a dearth of validated measures assessing asthma self-
management skills tailored specifically for adolescents. Objective: This study aims to fill this gap by developing
and a reliable and valid asthma self-management questionnaire specifically designed for adolescents with
asthma aged 12-21. Method: The asthma self-management behavior framework will underpin the development
of a novel adolescent self-management questionnaire. We will follow the seven-step approach outlined in
published guidelines to compose and validate questionnaire items. To compose questionnaire items, we will
draw on our team’s prior clinical and research experiences with adolescents, asthma, self-management, and
questionnaire development, including our qualitative study and recently published systematic review. We will
integrate TWU student researchers into all phases of our study throughout the three-year grant period. We will
employ a participatory research approach through active involvement of adolescents with asthma in item
writing. The items face and content validity will be established by having experts (n= 8) assess the clarity and
relevance of questionnaire items with respect to the construct of interest. Cognitive interviews will be conducted
with adolescents with asthma (n=10) to ensure the respondents interpret items in the manner that researchers
intended. We will establish the questionnaire’s psychometric properties by evaluating the questionnaire's
factorial validity using a sample of 300 adolescents (12-21 years old) living with asthma (n=150 each in
exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis) recruited from schools, clinics, and national asthma organizations
using purposive and snowballing techniques. Construct validity will be established by examining its
relationships with relevant variables, such as quality of life and self-efficacy, while questionnaire reliability will
be assessed through internal consistency and test-retest reliability tests. Significance: Adolescents are at a
vulnerable yet opportune stage to learn asthma self-management. The newly developed and validated
questionnaire will have the potential to facilitate assessment and feedback in multidisciplinary clinical settings
and offer a research tool to more accurately understand adolescent asthma self-management."

encountered immediately prior to, during, and shortly after their pregnancy.
 Goal 1: Implement population-based surveillance within Mississippi on selected maternal behaviors and
 experiences that occur prior to, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women with a recent live birth,
 including emerging issues and post-disaster surveillance needs, as they arise.
 Goal 2: Ensure surveillance data is of high scientific quality, timely, and comparable to other jurisdictions
 by following the methodology documented in the CDC PRAMS protocol.
Aim 2: Working with CDC, the Mississippi PRAMS Steering Committee and other Mississippi stakeholders,
provide analysis of Mississippi PRAMS data that is informative and supports relevant public health practices,
research, and programs.
 Goal 3: Conduct comprehensive analyses of Mississippi PRAMS data based on a written analysis plan
 designed to inform programmatic activities, research, and public health practice.
 Goal 4: Translate and disseminate analytic results into useable information for public health action that
 can guide program development and evaluation, in collaboration with the Mississippi PRAMS Steering
Committee.
Aim 3: Collaborating with public health officials, legislators, and researchers both within Mississippi and
throughout the nation, address strategies to improve health equity and health outcomes among pregnant
women and their newborn infants.
 Goal 5: Advance public health efforts that focus on preventable causes of infant mortality and maternal
 mortality with a health equity focus utilizing collaborative research and strategic partnerships."

young people and adults for various research projects, and have developed robust strategies for
deep collaboration, participant engagement, and effective data analysis and dissemination. Our
team proposes to conduct direct consultation with and support for T/NASOs in identifying
relevant research topics for their communities, developing research questions and methods,
collecting data, and documenting and disseminating findings. We will also offer both remote and
in-person training focused on research design, survey development, data collection, and

biomedical approaches with Indigenous ways of understanding and addressing behavioral health,
while maintaining respect for data sovereignty and cultural sensitivity. Our team includes
researchers from multiple disciplines, and has extensive experience in community participatory
research, designing and implementing interventions, managing projects, and disseminating
results in engaging and accessible formats. Our approach emphasizes advancement of community priorities, with advisory boards of young people, Elders, practitioners, parents, and other community members to help guide projects at all stages. Our interventions are developed in
partnership with AI/AN communities to ensure sustainability beyond the funding period. We
have also been innovative in disseminating findings and intervention curricula through online
platforms and videos. In summary, this grant proposal aims to leverage our collective expertise to
help T/NASOs build capacity to conduct NIH-funded research focused on overdose, substance

This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and acute and chronic pain."
10974441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have small but significant deficits in neurocognitive functioning compared
to their peers without diabetes, especially in the areas of memory, learning, and executive function skills.
Further, neuroimaging studies consistently observe differences in brain structures and brain development in
children with T1D, particularly brain white matter microstructure. These deficits in cognitive function negatively
affect children’s ability to manage diabetes effectively, increasing risk for poor glycemic outcomes and further
brain insults. Evidence suggests that factors such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at time of T1D onset and
exposure to chronic hyperglycemia or severe hypoglycemia may increase risk or severity of these deficits, but
findings are mixed, and many studies were limited by the inclusion of older adolescents or adults with T1D,
small, homogenous samples, or cross-sectional designs. Thus, a large prospective study of a diverse sample
of school-aged children newly diagnosed with T1D and a matched group of children without diabetes is needed
to identify modifiable risk and protective factors for neurocognitive complications in this population. We will
over-enroll children from minoritized racial and ethnic groups to understand factors that may contribute to
disparities in outcomes. As a Clinical Center, we will work with the Biostatistics Research Core, the NIDDK
Project Scientist, and the other centers to finalize the study protocol, including collection of neuroimaging,
neurocognitive, and glucose data, and development of neuroimaging harmonization plans. Our
multidisciplinary team includes a pediatric psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and
a pediatric neuroradiologist, as well as experts in imaging science and harmonization of imaging data. The
Children’s Diabetes Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center serves a large, diverse population of
children with T1D and has a strong history of multicenter collaborations with other pediatric diabetes centers.
Further, as recipients of a related U34 award, we engaged with community members, including caregivers of
children with T1D, to inform the study aims and protocol. The proposed project will assess hypothesized risk
factors (DKA at presentation, glycemic variability, adverse childhood experience, socioeconomic status), as
well as potentially modifiable protective factors (child sleep quality, caregiver distress, and use of diabetes
devices). In addition, we will optimize neuroimaging protocols and processing tools to allow for harmonization
of high-resolution neuroimaging data across sites and scanners for the most robust analysis. Reductions of
neuronal density and white matter integrity may be measured non-invasively via advanced MRI of the brain
methods. This project has the potential to influence standards of clinical care for children with T1D and to
pinpoint critical periods for prevention and intervention to improve brain health and function."
10974714,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Multiple organ failure is associated with a persistent systemic inflammatory response.
Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in blood, are important effectors of this response. Our preliminary
data identified gene expression changes in human neutrophils common to patients with 1) septic shock due to
an intraparenchymal infectious source (such as pneumonia and abdominal abscess); and 2) sterile vasoplegic
shock after major surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. This included increased levels of genes important
for leukocyte extravasation and migration through tissues. Importantly, these changes were not seen in
neutrophils from patients with sepsis from primary bloodstream and urinary tract infections, that is, from
patients without parenchymal injury. Similar changes have been reported in patients after traumatic injury.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that neutrophils responding to diverse inflammatory insults causing parenchymal
damage display a common, pro-invasive gene expression program.
Methods: In Aim 1, we will use existing whole-transcriptome RNA-seq human neutrophil data from our
laboratory to define the gene expression signature common to septic shock with intraparenchymal source;
multiple organ failure after major surgery; and traumatic injury. Upstream regulators of key gene modules will
be investigated as well as relevant biological pathways. In Aim 2, we will validate the gene expression
signature in secondary analysis of 11 published human neutrophil and leukocyte transcriptome datasets.
These datasets include microarray, bulk RNAseq, and single cell RNAseq data from septic patients with
intraparenchymal versus non-intraparenchymal source, surgical patients, and patients with traumatic injury. In
both Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will compare differences in dynamic expression between patients who developed
multiple organ failure, versus those who recovered without complications.
Expected Results: We expect to identify and validate a targeted neutrophil gene expression program specific
to parenchymal damage; to define the dynamic expression of this program in the development of multiple
organ failure versus good recovery; and to identify candidate upstream regulators for future investigation.
Impact and Long-Term Goals: This study will address current gaps in understanding of the specificity of the
systemic inflammatory response and its relationship to multiple organ failure."

Program Objectives and Goals: This R25 proposal, Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in
Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases (PRIDE), aims to provide recent URM college graduates with
an intensive two-year mentored research experience in diabetes, endocrinology, and metabolism (DEM), and
tailored professional development coursework to successfully guide scholars through the graduate school
application process and ensure their success in completing a research-focused biomedical degree program
(Ph.D. or MD/PhD). Through our proposed recruitment efforts and multi-layered mentoring approach, this
proposal will build and enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce in NIDDK mission areas.
Program Design: PRIDE will be geared towards URM college graduates who have graduated no more than 36
months prior to the start of the program and are not currently enrolled in a degree program. Eight scholars in
total will participate in the WashU PRIDE program. In year 1, PRIDE will recruit four scholars for two years of
intensive training in biomedical DEM research and professional development by leveraging the robust physical,
administrative, and educational infrastructure and DEM resources available at WashU. In year 3, an additional
four scholars will be recruited to participate in the program. Our Program Directors (PDs) have an extensive
collaboration record in designing, organizing, and recruiting for DEM-related trainee programs. They lead highly
successful summer and year-round programs for undergraduate and graduate URM scholars at WashU to
support long-term research pathways into DEM. We will use evidence-based recruitment strategies and leverage
our strong relationships with institutions primarily serving URM students to recruit scholars into the program.
The Research Training Plan will include: 1) State-of the-art, structured, yet individualized research training by
performing DEM-related scientific projects; 2) Personalized selection of seminars, workshops and coursework
for scholars to develop skills necessary for acceptance and completion of top-tier doctoral degree programs and
expertise in DEM research and 3) Engagement with other WashU post-bac and graduate-level scholars.
To achieve these program goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Integrate and augment current training
programs to fit the unique needs of PRIDE trainees. Aim 2. Recruit URM postgraduate scholars and provide
individualized mentorship for their successful entry and completion of a doctoral degree program. Aim 3. Provide
rigorous DEM-focused research, coursework, and networking opportunities for scholars using a competency
(rather than deficit) model. Aim 4. Evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of NIDDK-PRIDE. These
objectives will encourage and facilitate undergraduate students from URM groups to stay engaged in scientific
research and support their entry into graduate programs performing research related to NIDDK."
10973856,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) represent the most common forms of
neurodegenerative disease in patients above 65 years of age. Growing evidence has suggested that the
potential causes of AD/ADRD in the aging population are multi-faceted and are likely mediated through an
interaction of lifestyle, genetic, and environmental risk factors. As an example of environmental factors, air
pollution caused by car exhaust and power plant emissions, contains hazardous airborne substances, such as
fine particulate matter (PM) with nitric oxide-related species (NOx), and is associated with increased risk of
cognitive impairment in AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay of genetic risk
factors (such as ApoE4) and environmental air pollution exposures (termed GxE) in AD/ADRD pathogenesis
remain largely unknown. In this application, we propose to study the targets of aberrant protein S-nitrosylation
after exposure to PM/NOx as found in air pollution in order to better characterize this exposome and to find
new potential targets of therapy for AD. In fact, we were the first group to show that increased levels of
NO/NOx contribute to synaptic damage, a major correlate to cognitive decline in sporadic AD/ADRD, via
aberrant protein S-nitrosylation forming SNO-proteins. For example, our recent findings in human postmortem
brains from AD patients vs. age-matched controls of both sexes and diverse backgrounds has produced
evidence for aberrantly S-nitrosylated proteins (SNO-proteins) in AD human brain that cause metabolic
energetic compromise and resulting synaptic loss in AD, the major neuropathological correlate to cognitive
decline. For our proposed work, we will use human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 2D cultures
and 3D cerebral organoids as well as in vivo xenotransplantation models. In Specific Aims 1 and 2, we will
determine the effect of the exposome, represented by PM/NOx present in air pollution, by assessing the S-
nitrosoproteome in hiPSC-derived 2D cultures and 3D cerebral organoids as well as in mouse AD models
carrying AD-related genetic variants vs. isogenic WT controls after exposure to PM/NOx. In Aim 3, we will
identify and validate aberrantly S-nitrosylated proteins formed in response to the PM/NOx exposome as
potential therapeutic targets in AD brain using hiPSC-derived 2D cultures and 3D cerebral organoids as well as
in vivo mouse xenotransplantation models. We can determine causality of the aberrantly S-nitrosylated
proteins by testing non-nitrosylatable mutant forms of the proteins, as we have previously described. Thus, the
significance of these S-nitrosoproteomic changes is that they will be linked to cognitive decline in AD, and
therefore S-nitrosylated protein changes arising from the exposome may represent potential new therapeutic
targets."
10973924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Structural variation alters approximately 3.4 times more base pairs than point mutations within the human
genome. Structural variations, such as amplification, deletion, inversions, or translocations, alter genes and
non-genic regions in several different diseases, such as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, Charcot-Marie-Tooth,
cancer, chromoplexia, and undiagnosed genetic diseases. Long molecule read lengths are beneficial for
studying complex disease genetics. Many diseases involve multiple genetic variants and regulatory elements,
and longer reads provide a more comprehensive view of the genomic regions associated with disease
susceptibility, enabling the identification of variants and potential disease mechanisms. A significant obstacle in
the field is DNA length prior to sequencing and physical mapping. Longer molecules are necessary to span
large variations, with enough unique information on each side to determine the size and genetic information
within the variation. Our long-term goal is to develop a system to protect and concentrate huge DNA molecules
for physical mapping or sequencing systems to analyze genomes for structural variations. The overall objective
of this application is to protect and concentrate whole S. cerevisiae and E. coli chromosomes. Once the system
is tested with S. cerevisiae and E. coli, this system will be used for more complex samples. Our central
hypothesis is that sizeable DNA molecules can be protected in an inverted insert and concentrated in a 3D-
printed device with an acrylamide roadblock. The rationale for this project is to create a method to protect and
concentrate huge DNA molecules since no available system currently exists. To accomplish this, we put forth
the following specific aims: 1) Develop an inverted insert to protect DNA during cell lysis. 2) Develop a
roadblock to concentrate chromosomal DNA. This project is innovative as it a) utilizes 3D printing to create a
device and allows rapid modifications to the device, b) uses a roadblock to slow down the progression of DNA
so DNA can be concentrated in the solution, c) protects DNA inside the inverted insert during cell lysis, so the
DNA remains full length, and d) develops a system to protect and concentrate large DNA molecules (200 kb -
5 Mb). The significance of this project is devising a system to concentrate large DNA molecules that can span
large variations within a genome with enough unique information on either side of the variation to discern
variations associated with different diseases, enhance sequencing efficiency, improve genome assembly, and
aid in phasing and haplotype reconstruction."
10974858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in prepubertal children with Type 1 Diabetes
Mellitus (T1DM) is not understood. It is likely that hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, vascular
disease, insulin resistance, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) play important roles. However, the
absence of longitudinal studies in T1DM children and our lack of understanding of the
pathogenesis of neuronal defects limit our ability to prevent cognitive disability and identify and
treat those at highest risk. Despite preliminary evidence that T1DM is associated with alterations
in brain structure and function, major gaps remain in our knowledge about how T1DM impacts
the developing brain.
The overall premise of this project is that T1DM in children is associated with significant
neurocognitive and brain alterations and the risk of developing neurocognitive deficits
increases with both biological and psychosocial stress that ultimately delay/impede the
normal maturation of associative brain systems supporting attention, learning and
memory, executive and social cognition. Our hypothesis is that children with greater net
exposure to biological and psychosocial stress will have greater deficits in trajectory of brain
development underlying complex cognition.
Our multidisciplinary team of neuroimaging experts and endocrinologists will examine brain and
cognitive alterations in children with T1DM across three aims: Aim 1 will measure the
differential impact of age of T1DM diagnosis on brain structure, micro-organization, metabolism
and function and mental health. Aim 2 will Identify biological and psychosocial moderators and
Risk and Resilience factors. We will evaluate the impact of both biological stressors and social
determinants of health (e.g., SES, Education, Adversity exposure, rurality, access to healthcare
services, race, etc.) on neurocognitive function and maturation in children with T1DM. In Aim 3
we will develop a recruitment, retention and dissemination strategy to prepare for future clinical
trials that build a precision risk- and resilience-prediction model.
The findings from this observational study will bridge gaps in our understanding of the
development of neurocognitive dysfunction in T1DM. It will further inform key clinical targets to
address to ensure the optimal care of children with T1DM. The power of a larger network will
further allow the exploration of complex 2-way or even 3-way interactions between biological
and social determinants of health and neurofunctional outcomes in children with T1DM."
10974795,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many cancer survivors experience challenges in performing daily activities and loss of work productivity due to
the adverse effects of cancer and its treatments, resulting in financial burdens for both individuals and society.
These effects are more pronounced in vulnerable groups of cancer survivors, including racial and ethnic
minorities, individuals living in rural areas, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Exercise is effective
for improving physical function and reducing treatment-related side effects, but many cancer survivors are
insufficiently active after diagnosis. Given the profound implications of cancer on individual and societal health,
it is crucial to address these challenges through the development of scalable, effective exercise interventions
accessible to all, including vulnerable populations. Additionally, identifying patients at risk of functional loss as a
result of cancer treatment will be essential to ensuring that exercise is directed to the individuals most likely to
benefit and that programs are developed for successful implementation in these populations.
The overall goals of this U34 Clinical Trials Planning Grant are to further define the population of patients most
likely to derive benefit from the incorporation of exercise during cancer treatment, establish the feasibility of
enrolling and retaining a diverse patient population to an exercise oncology intervention trial during
chemotherapy, successfully implement a technology-enabled exercise program across academic and community
oncology practices, and identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of an exercise intervention trial in
key stakeholders. The planning grant will include an assessment of factors associated with a decline in function
in individuals enrolled in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-3 cohort and single-arm exercise
intervention pilot study conducted through the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology NCORP research base.
The pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a virtual aerobic and resistance-training exercise
intervention trial in 80 patients at risk of functional decline undergoing chemotherapy in community and academic
sites. Feasibility will be defined based on rates of enrollment, diversity of the patient population, retention, and
adherence to the exercise program. The exercise intervention program will be delivered centrally by exercise
trainers based at DFCI via telehealth sessions accessed through a study-provided cellular-enabled tablet. Key
stakeholders, including patients, patient advocates, caregivers, and clinical staff involved in the pilot study will
undergo semi-structured interviews focused on facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the exercise
intervention. Results of this planning grant will be used to inform the development of a Phase III trial to assess
the efficacy of an efficient technology-enabled exercise oncology intervention to prevent the decline in physical
function often observed in patients receiving chemotherapy, toward the goal of reducing the number of cancer
survivors requiring SSA Disability designation and increasing the capacity for full employment."
10974937,"Project Summary/Abstract
Interest in organosilane chemistry has increased rapidly in recent years for biomedical research. Because
organosilanes are stable, abundant, and virtually nontoxic, they serve as extremely important synthetic
building blocks for preparation of a wide range of biomedically important molecules. Despite the advances in
organosilane chemistry, the development of broadly applicable, highly selective silylation of unactivated C–C
and C–H bonds remains a significant challenge. The long-term goal of this research is to develop highly
efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of high-value synthetic building blocks and bioactive molecules.
The objective of this proposal is to expand the scope of organosilicon chemistry directed towards organic
synthesis by developing new synthetic tools. This entails a new bond activation catalysis that involves C–H
and C–C silylation using a traceless N,O-acetal directing group, as well as controlled catalytic hydrosilylation
of dicarboxylic acids. The rationale is that the proposed research will significantly improve our knowledge
concerning such catalytic strategies, and it will also offer original approaches to structural motifs including
readily functionalizable silicon-containing heterocycles. To accomplish the objective, this research program
introduces three innovative synthetic strategies. Specific Aim I: develop catalytic C–H silylation of anilines
with a traceless N,O-acetal directing group. The hypothesis for Aim I is that an N,O-acetal directs C–H
silylation of anilines. The resulting N,O-acetal directing group can be spontaneously removed upon treatment
of nucleophilic addition reactions. Specific Aim II: develop catalytic chemo- and stereoselective hydrosilylation
of dicarboxylic acid anhydrides and imides. The hypothesis for Aim II is that iridium catalyst with
dihydrosilanes to form a binuclear silylene-bridged iridium dimer enables controlled carbonyl hydrosilylation,
differentiating between two carbonyls holding different sterics and electronics within 1,3-dicarboxylic acids.
Specific Aim III: develop catalytic C–C silylation of cyclopropanols and cyclopropyl amines. The hypothesis
for Aim III is that chiral esters and amides can direct silyl acetal to a hindered carbon of cyclopropanols and
and cyclopropyl amines regio-, enantio-, and diastereoselectively, leading to a silicon-bearing tetrasubstituted
carbon center. The expected outcome of this work is to establish traceless acetal directed silylation strategies
for challenging synthetic problems delineated in Aim I–3 that will overcome current limitations and provide
high-value synthetic building blocks, substructural units of biomedically relevant targets, and silicon-
containing bioactive molecules. The results will have a significant positive impact because the proposed
research will be imminently useful to synthetic community and medicinal chemistry areas, specifically in the
discovery and production of new therapeutic agents. Finally, we believe that this research program offers
exceptional training for young chemists of the future."
10974667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 AA amyloidosis is a severe complication of chronic inflammatory disorders and is potentially fatal. The
amyloid fibrils involved in AA amyloidosis are derived from serum amyloid A (SAA), which is an acute phase
reactant protein. In AA amyloidosis, circulating amyloid fibrils are deposited in organs, ultimately leading to their
failure. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is the major protein component of amyloid fibrils associated with AA amyloidosis.
There is accruing evidence that overexpression of SAA is correlated with the severity of inflammation caused by
COVID-19. These highlight the need to unravel the mechanism of SAA misfolding that could in turn facilitate the
design of potential inhibitors. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have yielded an in silico model for SAA
misfolding where the N-terminal helical (helix-1) region plays a pivotal role. Helix-1 is believed to transition from
a -helix to -hairpin. Once formed, the -hairpin units are postulated to associate and stack upon themselves
to yield fibrils. We propose to investigate the veracity of the in silico model of SAA misfolding by synthesizing
and characterizing peptide mutants derived from the helix-1 region of SAA and the longer fragment, SAA1-76. The
roles of specific amino acids will be probed along with the trajectory each takes during SAA misfolding. Using
standard spectroscopic methods, we will determine changes in amyloidogenic propensity, conformation, key
molecular interaction, and amyloid morphology of each peptide during or after SAA fibrillization. Experimental
data will be correlated with the findings of the in silico results to yield information on the mechanism. The data
obtained from helix-1 fragments SAA1-13 and SAA1-27 will be extended to the truncated peptide, SAA1-76, found in
amyloid deposits of SAA. We intend to emply in silico and in vitro study to help yield important mechanistic clues.
 One of the major goals of this project is to provide students, >50% of whom are underrepresented minorities,
with the opportunity to conduct research and gain experience working in a modern biomedical laboratory.
Undergraduate researchers involved in the project will be expected to synthesize and spectroscopically
characterize peptides, verify spectroscopic data using MD simulation, and characterize amyloid morphology.
Each student will focus on aspects of the project that best interest them and fit their background. Regular
research group meetings will ensure that students participate in the planning of experiments and analysis of
data. Students will have the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to real world biochemical
investigation. Research experiences that are based on current technology allow students to solidify and fortify
their knowledge. Hands-on experiential learning is one of the most effective approaches to develop students’
critical thinking, perseverance, and confidence that could translate to a fulfilling career. Their experience will help
them enter graduate programs and/or find employment in biomedical careers. The educational impact of this
project also extends to local high school and community college students working in the PI’s laboratory. The
research experiences of these students will help ensure the vibrancy of the scientific infrastructure in the US."

such as primary microcephaly and cancer. Hence, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms
that regulate centrosome biology. Previous studies have revealed that a centrosome-associated
membrane structure called the centriculum plays a critical role in regulating centrosome function.
However, the mechanism by which membranes and membrane-associated proteins regulate
centrosomes is unknown. Prior studies have suggested roles for the membrane-associated endocytic
proteins clathrin and dynamin in regulating centrosome number and PCM assembly, respectively.
However, our understanding of the mechanism by this occurs is unclear. This proposal uses C. elegans
as a model system to elucidate how the vesicular trafficking proteins clathrin (clathrin heavy chain is
CHC-1 in C. elegans) and dynamin (DYN-1 in C. elegans) regulate centrosomes. Our long-term goal is to
understand how membranes and membrane-associated proteins regulate centrosome biology. The
overall objectives in this application are to understand how the membrane-associated endocytic proteins
CHC-1 and DYN-1 collaborate with the core centrosome proteins ZYG-1 and SPD-2, respectively to
regulate centrosome number and PCM assembly. Our central hypothesis is that CHC-1 and DYN-1
regulate ZYG-1 and SPD-2 protein localizations respectively, either in an endocytosis-dependent or in an
endocytosis-independent manner to ensure a properly built and functioning centrosome. Our hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which CHC-1 and ZYG-1
interact and elucidate the effect of perturbing this interaction on centrosome duplication and ZYG-1
localization. 2) Test the hypothesis that DYN-1 plays a critical role in PCM assembly by controlling the
amount of SDP-2 recruitment via vesicular trafficking. We will utilize cell and molecular biology
techniques and C. elegans genetics to test our specific aims. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because we are the first to investigate the contribution of the membrane-associated vesicular
trafficking proteins CHC-1 and DYN-1 to centrosome biology in an in vivo model system. Developing
therapeutic interventions for any disease begins with understanding the fundamental mechanisms
underlying disease-associated processes at the level of basic science. The proposed research is
significant because the dysregulation of centrosome number and function is associated with a host of
diseases, making a more comprehensive understanding of how centrosome processes are regulated at
the mechanistic level imperative."
10974534,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Development of multicellular biofilm communities is vital to the lifecycle of many bacterial species. Biofilm
formation begins with the attachment of a motile bacterium to a surface, though the underling mechanisms that
regulate surface attachment in most biofilm-forming bacterial species remain to be elucidated. For the pandemic
cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae, proper regulation of the type IV mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA), is
a key factor for mediating the transition from environmental colonization to host infection and pathogenesis.
MSHA pilus production is essential for V. cholerae environmental surface attachment and biofilm formation, but
cell-surface exposure of MSHA pili in the host results in bacterial clearance, preventing host infection and
pathogenesis. In V. cholerae, MSHA pilus components are projected to be encoded within three distinct genetic
operons; an assembly operon (msh-I), a structural operon (msh-II), and a retraction operon (pilTU). However,
little is known about how these msh operons are expressed or regulated. Given that proper regulation of MSHA
pilus expression/production is vital for not only environmental survival, but for host colonization and infection, the
goal of my research group is to define mechanisms and regulatory pathways that mediated MSHA pilus
production to facilitate these vital niche transitions during the V. cholerae lifecycle. An initial screen for regulators
of MSHA production, identified the fatty acid metabolism regulator protein FadR as a putative positive regulator
(enhancer) of msh-I operon expression under environmental conditions. Enhancer activity of FadR is negatively-
controlled by exogenously-derived long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), which are a large component of the
mammalian diet, and can readily be taken up from the environment by V. cholerae. Our preliminary data
demonstrates that both deletion of fadR and supplementation of known FadR LCFA ligands, significantly
diminishes msh-I operon expression. Our working hypothesis is that FadR promotes expression of the msh-I
operon to facilitate MSHA pilus production and surface colonization under environmental conditions, and that
host-derived LCFAs suppress FadR enhancer activity to down-regulate MSHA production and promote V.
cholerae host colonization and infection. This proposal seeks to address this hypothesis, through two specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the promoter regions of the msh operons, and evaluate FadR-mediated
regulation of msh-I operon expression and MSHA pilus production. We will then seek to assess the role of FadR
LCFA ligands on the regulation of FadR enhancer activity of msh-I expression, MSHA pilus production, and V.
cholerae surface colonization and biofilm formation as a part of Aim 2. The outcome of this work will elucidate a
novel host-responsive regulatory mechanism that facilitates transitions in niche colonization during the V.
cholerae lifecycle, and could lead to the development of strategies for attenuation of V. cholerae environmental
persistence and/or host infectivity."

The NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing protein, also known as NOD-like receptor)
family is a diverse group of proteins that functions to regulate host immunity. Many of the NLRs have been shown
to regulate inflammasome formation and control caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 secretion and inflammatory
cell death. In contrast a subset of NLR proteins negatively regulates different inflammatory pathways, typically
via inhibitory interactions with key signaling molecules. Nonetheless the molecular mechanisms that control the
negative regulation of inflammation are poorly understood. NLRC3 in particular has been shown to negatively
regulate several key inflammatory pathways. For example, NLRC3 has been shown to inhibit NF-κB and PI3K
pathways in response to TLR (or IGF-1R) signaling and proinflammatory cytokine secretion; alternatively, NLRC3
inhibits type I interferon production in response to cytosolic nucleic acid stimulation by regulating STING
trafficking. The molecular mechanisms to allow for NLRC3 to function in diverse pathways are poorly understood.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of negative regulation of inflammation will be necessary for the
generation of new strategies to improve health. Aim 1 of my proposal uses classic biochemical and cell biological
techniques to examine the molecular determinants of novel protein-protein interactors with NLRC3. Our studies
suggest that one of these interactors negatively regulates type I interferon production. In aim 1 of our proposal
we will generate recombinant cell lines via CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA and overexpression to probe the specific role
of each PPI. In aim 2 we will investigate the molecular mechanism of innate immune signaling pathways that
are associated with NLRC3"

Traditional training in kidney, urologic or hematologic (KUH) research equips the basic, translational 
and clinical investigator with specific knowledge and technical skills that are particular to each of these 
individual disciplines. During their careers, however, investigators can find it challenging to cross boundaries 
between their specific areas of expertise to address important questions in overlapping KUH disciplines. These 
“leaps” have to be encouraged and taught, as it is through these interdisciplinary interactions and 
collaborations that we will advance KUH research and achieve the scientific discoveries needed to improve the 
care and quality of life of people with KUH diseases. 
The training program that we propose in this U2C/TL1 application aims to prepare the next generation 
of KUH investigators with the interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mindset that will allow them to naturally 
engage and seek interdisciplinary collaborations. To achieve this goal, we will harness the experience and 
excellence in research and training of four of the leading medical schools in the New York City (NYC) 
metropolitan region, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the 
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, 
to establish the “New York Consortium for Interdisciplinary Training in Kidney, Urological and Hematological 
Research” (NYC Train KUHR)” (pronounced “NYC Train cure”). The Training Core will be developed around 
the strong supporting system provided by the other NYC Train KUHR Cores: the Networking Core, the 
Professional Development Core and the Administrative Core. 
The Training Core will promote interdisciplinary thinking and support development of technical skills to 
facilitate engagement in collaborations and team science. The proposed program builds on our experience 
from three existing, successful nephrology T32 grants, an R25 grant, a T35 grant and an NIH O’Brien Center in 
Urology. It also builds on the combined research and training strengths of over 100 preceptors from across the 
four institutions that bring to the program their expertise in KUH research and complementary areas, including 
genomics, developmental biology, epidemiology, neuroscience, bioengineering and clinical trials across the 
lifespan. At its full capacity, the program will train 9 pre-doctoral and 16 post-doctoral fellows across the four 
institutions. The training program will use independent development plans and thesis and scholarship oversight 
committees to individualize trainee experiences. Emphasis will be placed on experiential mentored research 
experiences as well as professional development activities to prepare the trainees for a research career in 
academic medicine. The knowledge and skills learned from this training program and the other educational and 
professional development activities promoted by the NYC Train KUHR will allow this new cadre of investigators 
to work across different disciplines to develop novel concepts to advance KUH research."
10975149,"Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) is the most common inherited recessive ataxia, for which there is no FDA-approved
therapy. FA's pathophysiological mechanism is caused by the reduction of just one mitochondrial protein, frataxin (FXN),
that functions in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 5 and 15 years and
worsen over time. Although sensory and balance deficits put FA patients in wheelchairs, nearly all FA patients die of
cardiomyopathy. Currently, there are no drug therapies that ameliorate FA cardiomyopathy and most with FA die of the
cardiomyopathy in their 30s.
 We identified redox deficiency in FA human fibroblasts, and used this to screen a library of 1600 drugs already
safely used in humans, to test for their ability to prevent cell death in FA. We identified dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a
prodrug precursor of monomethyl fumarate (MMF), as the most protective among all tested drugs. DMF (also known as
Tecfidera and Skilarence) is the FDA approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. In the most
physiological mouse model of FA (the FXNKD), we found that 1) DMF dose-dependently rescued FXN levels and the
mitochondrial Fe-S cluster enzymes aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase activity in the heart; 2) DMF significantly
rescued three critical cardiac deficits in mice that resemble human FA cardiac defects: a) left ventricular hypertrophy; b)
decreased stroke volume; and c) decreased cardiac output. Preliminary data support the claim that DMF is providing
mitochondrial->frataxin-> Fe-S cluster support via Nrf2-dependent mechanism.
 Additionally, we recently synthesized an alternative MMF prodrug called IMF, with improved pharmacokinetics
that may be even more potent than DMF. Therefore, we hypothesize that fumarates DMF/IMF represent a novel
therapeutic strategy that can potentially be repurposed for the lethal cardiomyopathy in FA. The aim of the current work
is to determine the effects of DMF/IMF on the function of most affected tissues in FA (heart and skeletal muscles), and to
determine the mechanism of protective action. DMF has already passed through FDA's safety, toxicology and DMPK
hurdles, and thus could enter clinical trials much more quickly than a new compound that must pass through extensive
safety and toxicology testing before it could be used in clinical trials. However, before attempting to use the drug in
humans with FA, completion of the 'pre-clinical package' for DMF/IMF and their role for cardiac/skeletal muscle
protection in FA are important, and can be addressed in the three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is designed to determine optimal
dosing of DMF & IMF that rescue cardiac and skeletal muscles deficits. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism
responsible for functional recovery in the FXNKD mouse. Aim 3 is designed to determine whether optimal dosing of
DMF/IMF extends the life span of mouse with cardiac-specific FXN KO (MCK-Cre). Cumulatively these aims will
generate pre-clinical data for the potential use of DMF and IMF for lethal cardiomyopathy in FA. Because DMF is
already approved for use in humans with safety/DMPK/toxicology and Phase I studies already completed, it has a greater
opportunity to be 'fast-tracked' for treatment of cardiac myopathy in FA."
10973752,"Project Summary
With age, dividing cells acquire DNA mutations. A small number of these somatic mutations confer a selective
advantage leading to clonal outgrowth. In blood, this process is termed ‘clonal hematopoiesis’ (CH) which
includes both point mutations in cancer driver genes (eg. clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential
‘CHIP’) and megabase-scale deletions, duplications and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (eg, mosaic
chromosomal alterations, ‘mCAs’). CH is associated with mortality, infection, cardiovascular disease, cancer
and other aging diseases with differential mutations conferring different risk. CH is commonly found in
extremely aged individuals implying that a set of individuals have resiliency to CH. Here we seek to identify
Clonal Hematopoiesis Aging Resilience Mechanisms (CHARMs). CH clones that expand to make up a larger
proportion of the blood confer worse health outcomes. However, we do not know what factors predict the rate
of clonal expansion, how rate expansion associates with disease outcomes and whether CH confers
differential disease risk across the lifespan. Overall, we hypothesize that CH with higher rates of clonal
expansion confer a greater impact on health and that the propensity to expand has genetic and environmental
underpinnings. A barrier to addressing this gap is a paucity of large-scale collections of longitudinally-sampled
blood. Our team has two recent accomplishments that enable us to address this gap: 1) a survey of CH in
>800,000 genomes and 2) development of a novel computational method to estimate the rate of CH expansion
from a single timepoint rather than requiring serial samples. The project comprises three key aims: In Aim 1,
we will apply a computational method called PACER, which estimates CH expansion rates from a single
genome sequenced blood sample to >1.6 Million individuals. This approach allows for the identification of
inherited genetic factors that confer resilience to CH expansion. In Aim 2, we will focus on the role of circulating
proteins, metabolites, and medications in modulating CH expansion. In vitro and in vivo models will be used to
elucidate the mechanisms underlying these CHARMs. In Aim 3, we seek to comprehensively assess the
impact of CH on health and disease across the entire human lifespan. By studying two large and diverse
cohorts, NIH All of Us (N~750,000) and Vanderbilt BioVU (N~250,000), encompassing individuals that span
the entire lifespan from birth to centenarians, the project will analyze the relationship between CH and aging
diseases. Our multidisciplinary team with deep expertise in CH, human genomics, experimental hematology,
and genetic epidemiology is uniquely poised to accomplish this scientific program. Successful execution of
these aims has the potential to improve risk models to stratify individuals with CH for personalized prevention
interventions. Additionally, each CHARM we identify would be a potential target for therapeutic development."
10973930,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to improve our understanding of the factors that drive clonal hematopoiesis
(CH) evolution to prevent CH-related adverse outcomes and promote healthy aging. CH is common with
aging. Most mutations are present in a small proportion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Yet in some
individuals, the proportion of mutated HSCs will expand resulting in dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune
cell function. CH is associated with several age-related diseases, including two leading causes of death and
disability among the elderly: cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanisms
driving CH evolution are largely undefined. This is due, in part, to a lack of longitudinal studies of CH alongside
comprehensive risk factor assessment. CH alters the balance of immune cell pro- and anti-inflammatory
signaling. This is thought to underlie many CH-disease associations. Pre-clinical models suggest that chronic
inflammation promotes CH fitness, but this has yet to be established in human studies. Chronic inflammation, as
driven by an unhealthy lifestyle, has also been shown to increase the risk of many age-related diseases.
Unhealthy lifestyle is prevalent throughout the United States and contributes to up to 60% of premature deaths.
There are conflicting results regarding the association between CH and an unhealthy lifestyle. This may be due
to measurement error driven by imprecise, one-time assessments of lifestyle risk factors. Longitudinal studies of
both CH and lifestyle risk factors over the life-course of an individual are needed. Here we seek to characterize
how inherited and lifestyle risk factors influence CH fitness and to identify the central pathways that determine
long-term CH evolutionary trajectories and disease progression. Through our preliminary work, we jointly
characterized CH and plasma proteomic profiles of 46,237 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKBB). We identified
79 proteins significantly associated with CH, the majority of which are known immune regulators. A subset of
these proteins also predicts risk of CVD and AD development. Our central hypothesis is that inherited, and
lifestyle risk factors impact CH evolution through immune dysregulation and that this in turn determines
the development of age-related outcomes. We will leverage existing data from large-scale biobanks alongside
comprehensive CH profiling in unique cohorts with repeated risk factor and biologic measurements. This includes
two prospective cohorts with >30 years of follow-up: 1) The Health Professionals Follow-up Study, with rich
assessment of lifestyle risk factors alongside centrally adjudicated CVD outcomes and 2) The Knight Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center studies with centrally adjudicated cognition and AD outcomes alongside serial CSF
sampling. The specific aims are: (1) determine the impact of lifestyle and inherited risk factors on CH
evolution, (2) determine the pathways that mediate CH evolution and (3) determine the pathways that
mediate the association between CH with CVD and AD."

Cyanopeptides are not easily identifiable and quantified in water during harmful cyanobacterial blooms
(cHABs) because they are present as multiple congeners and a few of them are available as pure standards.
This prevents their identification and purification as well determination of their toxicities and potential to
cause diseases. The goal of this proposal is to apply modern fluorescence and MS methodologies and enable
discovery and purification of novel microcystins (MCs), anabaenopeptins (APs), and cyanopeptolins (CPs)
for toxicological studies in liver and kidney cell cultures. To accomplish this goal, we will combine methods
for sample preparation of toxic cyanopeptides with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to fluorescence
and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MSn) detection. The rationale is that the LC separation and
sequential detection of cyanotoxins by native fluorescence detector and a high-resolution mass spectrometer
will provide structural characterization of numerous novel MCs, APs, and CPs in samples collected during
cHABs in western Lake Erie. The specific aims are: 1. To optimize HPLC native fluorescence detection
with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer for structural analyses of MCs, APs, and CPs, 2. To perform structural
analyses, of these cyanopepides in cHAB samples using unique fragments and novel neutral losses during
MS/MS, and 3. To purify novel congeners using preparative LC and size exclusion chromatography and
study their toxicities in cell culture. Two important scientific questions will be answered: 1) is it possible
to isolate novel MCs, APs and CPs that will serve as cyanotoxin standards for toxicological studies, and 2)
what is the relationship between structure of novel congeners and their ability to intoxicate liver and kidney
cells? The results of this proposal will also be useful for the expending the databases containing structures
and toxicities of cyanotoxin congeners."

In some cancers, intriguingly, the same mutation results in drastically different disease phenotypes in different
patients. An example is a type of blood cancer, known as myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), where a single
nucleotide change in the JAK2 gene, may result in either an increase in the number of red blood cells, an increase
in the number of platelets, or scarring of bone marrow tissue, in different patients. The disease outcome is just
as unpredictable. Some patients show no symptoms for decades whereas others rapidly progress to acute
leukemias. This disconnect between genotype and phenotype may be due to the identity of the hematopoietic
stem cell (HSC) in which the mutation first occurs. Not all HSCs are equivalent and some may preferentially give
rise to certain types of blood cells. Additionally, the subsequent expansion of the population of mutated stem
cells may be different in different patients. Therefore, to understand the heterogeneity in disease presentation,
we would like to know when and in which cell the cancer mutation first occurred in each patient, how the
population of mutated HSCs expanded, and to what extent the differentiation trajectory of the cancer cells
deviates from that of the healthy cells. Here, we propose a comprehensive research program to make these
measurements in individual MPN patients. To understand the difference between the cancer cells and the
healthy cells in each patient, we will profile each cell individually. Bulk measurements average over the cancer
cells and healthy cells, and obscure different cell states along the differentiation trajectory. We have recently
developed a technology platform to simultaneously read out the full transcriptome and the cancer mutation in
single cells. We will apply this platform to cells obtained from bone marrow biopsies of MPN patients. To obtain
the history of the expansion of the cancer stem cells in each patient, we will reconstruct the lineage tree of the
HSCs by sequencing the somatic mutations in the whole genomes of individual HSCs. Somatic mutations occur
randomly at each cell division and are passed on to a cell’s descendants. Critically, we will also trace the
differentiation trajectories of the progenies of each HSC by identifying the somatic mutations that uniquely mark
each HSC in our single-cell transcriptomic data. Taken together, these measurements will provide the most
detailed molecular picture of MPN at a single-cell resolution and the most comprehensive molecular history of
cancer progression in individual patients. Finally, to identify and test potential therapies for MPN, we will engineer
animal models whereby lineage histories of individual cells can be obtained without whole genome sequencing.
We will engineer a mouse model of MPN in which individual cells record their lineage histories in their own DNA
by using Cas9 to induce heritable mutations in synthetic target arrays that are transcribed and read out using
sequencing. Our proposal will answer some of the most outstanding and fundamental questions about MPNs
and blood development. Ultimately, our measurements should reveal patient-specific targeted therapies that
preferentially eradicate the cancer stem cells or hinder their differentiation."
10975585,"ABSTRACT
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of immature
myeloblasts in the bone marrow and blood. Classically, AML is thought to arise due to a combination of signaling
mutations that increase proliferation and transcription factor mutations that impair differentiation. A prototypical
example of signaling activation in AML results from mutations in the growth factor receptor, Colony Stimulating
Factor 3 Receptor (CSF3R). Mutations in CSF3R, such as CSF3RT618I, cause constitutive activation of the
receptor in the absence of ligand and robust signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. This causes activation
of downstream transcription factors—STAT3 and STAT5, to promote the proliferation of progenitor cells and their
differentiation down the myeloid lineage. In patients with AML, mutations in CSF3R are associated with high
rates of relapse and poor overall survival, but the advent of effective therapies for these patients has remained
elusive. CSF3R mutations alone are insufficient to cause AML and require a second mutation that impairs
myeloid differentiation. The most common co-occurring mutations are loss-of-function mutations in critical
myeloid transcription factors, such as CCAAT binding protein alpha (CEBPA). In AML, CEBPA mutations block
CSF3R-driven differentiation, leading to the accumulation of immature myeloid blasts. This differentiation arrest
is a fundamental feature of the aggressive phenotype associated with CSF3R-driven AML. The objective of this
project is to understand the mechanism by which CEBPA mutations impair CSF3R-driven differentiation. The
aims of this project are to (1) determine the effect of CEBPA mutations on localization of STAT3 to regulatory
elements of differentiation-associated genes and (2) to understand the effect of mutant CEBPA on cellular
signaling pathways. A novel mouse cell line model of myeloid differentiation with biallelic Cebpa mutations
analogous to those found in patients with AML will facilitate the successful completion of these aims. A
combination of transcription factor profiling, gene expression, chromatin architecture and phospho-proteomics
will be used to nominate mechanistic targets. Follow up studies will perturb these targets to determine their role
in mutant-CEBPA driven differentiation block. AML is a devastating disease with poor outcomes despite
chemotherapeutic treatments. Understanding how mutant CEBPA impairs differentiation will help create a
mechanistic foundation for the development of more efficacious therapies to treat patients this disease."

Health-Related Research (Admin Supp - Clinical Trial Not Allowed). The parent grant is ‘Leptin signaling in the
carotid body: mechanisms and consequences’, R01HL133100-7, 04/01/2023 – 03/31/2025 with contact PI
Vsevolod Y Polotsky, MD, PhD. Obesity is a major health problem leading to high cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality Main complications of obesity are hypertension and sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which greatly
contribute to obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Our parent grant is focused on mechanisms by which
obesity acts on the carotid body (CB), a key sensor of hypoxia and multiple metabolic parameters, to cause
hypertension and SDB. In our parent grant we have shown that an adipocyte produced hormone leptin acts on
the long isoform of leptin receptor (LEPRb) in the CB glomus (Type I) cells to increase carotid sinus nerve (CSN)
activity leading to hypertension. LEPRb signaling in the CB causes transcriptional and post-transcriptional
activation of TRPM7, which is responsible for both respiratory and cardiovascular effects of leptin in CB.
However, leptin may act on the CB via alternative pathways. Leptin upregulates pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC),
which is a pre-hormone post-transcriptionally processed into several peptides, including α-melanocyte
stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a ligand for the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). MC4R deficiency prevents the
development of hypertension in obesity. MC4R has been implicated in the developing of hypertension in SDB
Our Preliminary Data show that CIH leads to a striking increase in Mc4r expression in CB. Of note, Trpm7
knockdown in the CB appeared to attenuate the effect of IH on Mc4r expression, which suggests that MC4R is
downstream of leptin-TRPM7 signaling. However, the role of CB MC4R in obesity and SDB related hypertension
is unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that, DIO and SDB act via MC4R in the CB to
increase carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity and hypoxic chemoreflex leading to hypertension and SDB,
all of which can be attenuated by Mc4r shRNA administered to the CB. Specific Aim 1 will examine the
role of MC4R in CB in DIO- and CIH- induced hypertension and potential implications for therapy. We propose
that DIO and CIH increase MC4R expression in CB, carotid sinus nerve (CSN) and sympathetic nerve (SNS)
activity and blood pressure, which will be attenuated by Mc4r shRNA applied to CB. Specific Aim 2 will examine
the role of MC4R in CB in DIO-induced SDB and potential implications for therapy. We propose that DIO
increases MC4R signaling in CB, which augments chemoreflex, destabilizes breathing and exacerbates SDB,
and that Mc4r shRNA applied to CB will decrease hypoxic chemoreflex and attenuate SDB. The Candidate, Dr.
Mateus Amorim will work on this proposal paving a way to his future career as an independent investigator."
10974535,"This proposal uses innovative approaches to uncover underlying molecular mechanisms and develop a novel
treatment strategy for frontal temporal dementia (FTD), the second most common form of young-onset dementia
and an Alzheimer-disease related dementia. Unfortunately, there are no treatment options that prevent or slow
FTD. A mutation in C9ORF72 (C9) is the most common cause of FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
collectively referred to as C9 ALS/FTD. This mutation leads to an abnormal excess of DNA and RNA structures,
termed G-quadruplexes. Increased G-quadruplex burden contributes to accumulation of toxic RNAs and proteins
leading to neuron degeneration and disease onset. As such, C9 ALS/FTD is fundamentally a ‘G-quadruplex
disease’. Within the cell reside helicase enzymes that unwind G-quadruplexes. DHX36 is a major G-quadruplex
helicase, accounting for the majority of G-quadruplex helicase activity in human cells. In the previous funding
period, it was shown that DHX36 enhances production of toxic C9 proteins via repeat-associated non-AUG
(RAN) translation. It was also shown that RAN translation of toxic C9 proteins during cellular stress requires
DHX36, linking DHX36, stress, and RAN translation for the first time. DHX36 localizes to stress granules
following stress, however it is unknown if the presence of DHX36 in stress granules is directly connected to
DHX36 effects on C9 RAN translation. For Aim 1, it is hypothesized that loss of DHX36 reduces C9 protein
translation through reduction of stress granule abundance. This hypothesis will be tested using C9 patient-
derived cells, mouse primary brain neurons, and in vivo transgenic mouse models. In addition to a cytoplasmic
effect of DHX36 on RAN translation, preliminary data suggest that DHX36 may protect C9 ALS/FTD cells from
increased DNA damage in the nucleus. These observations suggest that nuclear DHX36 may be protective while
cytoplasmic DHX36 may exacerbate C9 ALS/FTD. For Aim 2, it is hypothesized that specifically targeting
cytoplasmic DHX36 is a viable therapeutic strategy that reduces toxic C9 protein production while preserving
protective effects of nuclear DHX36. This hypothesis will be tested using human C9 ALS/FTD patient-derived
neuronal progenitor cells. This research builds on a long-standing collaboration between three research groups
led by Dr. Philip Smaldino (Ball State U.), Dr. Yuh-Hwa Wang (U. of Virginia), and Dr. Peter Todd (U. of Michigan),
with additional support from Dr. Lindsey Hayes (Johns Hopkins U.) and Dr. Ashley Kalinski (Ball State U.). The
proposed studies will be the first to determine the role of DHX36 in stress responses and genomic integrity in C9
ALS/FTD and is poised to identify DHX36 as a novel therapeutic target. Undergraduate and graduate students
will be integrated at every stage of the project allowing them to gain authentic experience with innovative cell
and mouse technologies applied to a deadly human disease. Completion of this work will include the training of
~24 research lab students and over 150 students in Course Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE)
taught by the PI, giving this proposal high potential to inspire future dementia-disease researchers."
10974591,"Recent emergent interest and progress in studying polyamines (PAs) demonstrate that PAs are key players in
Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson diseases and several syndromes as well as in aging and HIV
associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). PAs are released in whole brain from internal sources during
neuronal activity and trauma. Since PA content declines with aging, the neuroprotection afforded by PAs can
decline as well. This substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Intriguingly, PA content is
increasing in pathology and we hypothesize that it may be a kind of protective response. Indeed, dietary
spermidine (SD) is neuroprotective against aging, neurotoxicity, cognitive decline, brain injury and increases
lifespan.
During the previous R15 supported study, we showed that different glial cells, but not neurons, preferentially
accumulate PAs in healthy adult brain1 and retina2 and PAs are released by glial specific treatments3. We further
found that acetylated spermine (aSP) preliminary data and SP4 open connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junctions (GJs) in
astrocytes, however it is unknown if Cx43 hemichannels (HCs) are also opened by PAs. Therefore, PAs as novel
“gliomediators” open Cx43 GJs and keep glial syncytium integrity, isopotentiality and may help to hold healthy
brain status. Astrocytes convert PAs partially to GABA that is released to regulate synaptic activity5. In addition,
we showed that biotinylated SP is taken up by astrocytes via transporters and released via large Cx43 HCs
pores6, but it does not permeate from blood to brain7 suggesting uniquely internal PA exchange in the CNS.
Using a variety of novel sensors, we observed uptake and release of PAs in astrocytes. We measured both tonic
and vesicular SP release from astrocytes and showed that extracellular [SP]o reaches over 100 μM in response
to brain ischemia; a concentration sufficient to affect many receptors and channels in both neurons and glia. Our
overall hypothesis is that PAs: (1) are taken up by and (2) stored in astrocytes where PAs (3) promote opening
of GJs and (4) facilitate transfer of selective molecules4 through GJ channels between astrocytes in the astrocytic
syncytium. During glial activation, (5) PAs are liberated and (6) modulate neuronal receptors and channels
preliminary data. Such intercellular exchange of PAs has critical effects controlling glial and consequently neuronal
networks.
Despite its public health importance, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of PA fluxes in glial cells
which accumulate PAs. Remaining questions include: (i) Is PA accumulation in glia due to synthesis or Is there
a high affinity PA transport in glial cells as an alternative to low affinity pathways? (AIM-1), (ii) What are
the mechanisms of glial PA influx and efflux? and (iii) What are the consequences of PA release on
interneuron function? (AIM-2). The studies will lead to new scientific knowledge and research opportunities for
graduate students to further understand neurodegenerative and neuroprotection processes."
10974097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual concerns are among the most common, distressing, and persistent aspects of life after cancer. For at
least half of breast and gynecological cancer survivors, cancer treatment adversely affects physical, social, or
psychological aspects of sexual health. Examples include vaginal pain, loss of sensation, poor body image,
disrupted intimate relationships, and loss of sexual interest. Despite this, sexual concerns are often
unaddressed, with one major reason being lack of access to evidence-based interventions. In short, to improve
sexual health in cancer survivorship, there is an urgent need to test and implement accessible, evidence-based
interventions that can effectively reach cancer survivors in need. Mindfulness-based interventions have
demonstrated efficacy in addressing a range of sexual concerns and improving psychosexual health outcomes.
Our preliminary research demonstrated support for the acceptability of a virtually delivered mindfulness-based
intervention adapted specifically for breast and gynecological cancer survivors experiencing sexual concerns.
However, a more rigorous evaluation of this promising intervention, called Mindful After Cancer (MAC), is
needed to support wide implementation and dissemination. A pragmatic trial would be ideal because it would
facilitate the evaluation of MAC in the context of routine practice, which leads to more generalizable results and
shortens the gap from research to implementation outside of the trial setting, thus more quickly increasing
access for cancer survivors in need. The Specific Aims of the proposed R34 are 1) To conduct a pilot trial in
preparation for a future multisite pragmatic trial of the virtual MAC intervention and 2) To identify contextual
factors that may shape equitable reach and future implementation of the intervention. Our feasibility objectives
are to develop protocols for 1) recruitment, 2) retention, and 3) training and supervision for adequate
intervention fidelity for the planned future trial. Results of the proposed pilot trial will provide a robust scientific
foundation and preparation for a rigorously designed multisite pragmatic trial. Evaluation of intervention access
barriers and strategies to improve equitable recruitment and reach in both academic- and community-based
care settings will inform future implementation and dissemination of mindfulness-based interventions such as
MAC. Overall, results of the proposed project will readily translate to the protocol for rigorous, well-designed
multisite pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual MAC intervention in real world conditions
where we expect to implement and disseminate the intervention."
10974797,"Problematic alcohol use (PAU) is a common, yet serious, health issue among college students that can lead to
negative outcomes such as assault, alcohol use disorders and even death. Although PAU often occurs in group
settings, bystanders frequently choose to do nothing when witnessing their peers engaging in PAU. Little is
known about why, when, and where this lack of response occurs because there are no measures for assessing
and understanding bystander behavior in the context of PAU. This information is critically needed before
effective interventions for bystanders can be developed and evaluated. As part of our existing NIAAA funded
R15 (1R15AA028910-01), our team has developed the Bystander Intervention for Problematic Alcohol Use
Model (BIPAUM). We have also developed and tested a battery of scales to assess some constructs across
this model. However, additional constructs were identified in our qualitative work and corresponding scales
need to be developed and tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Develop measures of Notice and
Interpret, Identify Intervention Strategy, Assess Support, and Assess Outcomes, 2) establish the psychometric
properties and validate the remaining scales, and 3) establish measurement invariance of the scales. To
achieve Aim 1, the team will utilize existing data from our n=20 focus groups and n=9 interviews (n=79 diverse
college students) to create items to include in the additional scales. Scales will then be vetted by obtaining
feedback from students (n=80) and content experts (n=10). To achieve Aim 2, a sample of n=800 students will
be recruited via Prime Panels to complete a 20-minute survey containing these scales. These data will be used
to conduct item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and reliability analysis. Another sample of n=800 students
will be utilized to conduct confirmatory factor analyses, convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity checks.
Finally, to achieve Aim 3, we will use a multiple-group CFA framework to test validity and measurement
invariance of the BIPAUM. The same sample as Aim 2 will be used to accomplish Aim 3. Our research team
has expertise in measurement development, bystander behaviors, and PAU and is well suited to carry out this
work. Once all measures that correspond with the BIPAUM have been developed and validated and the model
can be tested, MPIs will seek R01 funding to conduct a longitudinal analysis of the BIPAUM, in addition to
designing and evaluating a novel bystander intervention program for PAU. An intervention that taps into the
social nature of bystander intervention and drinking and is theoretically informed has the potential to reduce
PAU and its detrimental consequences among college students."

Structural factors of health inequities are the systemic and societal conditions that contribute to disparities in
health among different populations. These disparities often stem from racial and socioeconomic discrimination
that are deeply intertwined in historical, social, economic, and political processes, and overtime have limited
access to quality education, job opportunities and wealth accumulation for minoritized communities. Therefore,
these communities are more likely to experience disinvestment in their neighborhoods leading to reduced
access to health care and healthy foods, and lower educational and employment opportunities. The Partners
Engaged in Equity Research Hub (PEER Hub), based at the University of Michigan School of Public Health,
leverages our institutional and national networks and training and technical assistance (TTA) expertise to
support community-led interventions to advance health equity, especially in the areas of neighborhood and
built environment, social and cultural context, access and quality of community health care services, economic
development, and nutrition and food environment. We bring together an interdisciplinary team of researchers,
practitioners and community-based organizations with expertise and experience in addressing structural
factors contributing to health inequities. Our overall goal is to support localized solutions tailored to the unique
needs of the population while fostering a sense of ownership and empowerment, all crucial for sustainable
change. Working in close collaboration with the NIH ComPASS Network, Coordinating Center and a
multidisciplinary panel of experts (MEP), the UM PEER Hub will: 1) provide centralized administrative,
operational, and logistical infrastructure to support the network of community-led (CHESI) research studies; 2)
provide locally relevant proactive technical assistance to assigned CHESI projects to support high quality
implementation and future sustainability of the community-led research initiatives, and to establish data
infrastructure to support and facilitate cross-site research coordination; 3) build capacity to conduct high quality
community-led health equity research through tailored training and technical assistance; and 4) support and
enhance effective community-academic partnerships and mentor the next generation of community engaged
scholars. In keeping with our community-focused approach, our Research Hub will be guided by a Community
Steering Committee to help ensure equitable practices within our own work and across our team, partners, and
community sites."
10974160,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for obesity and cardiovascular disease across age groups. Numerous
studies across the lifespan have found cross-sectional associations indicating neighborhood environment
features (e.g., walkability) are favorably related to both physical activity and BMI/weight status. Though there
was evidence from prospective studies supporting what has been found in cross-sectional studies, important
gaps remain. Many prospective studies did not allow for interpretation of the magnitude of changes in
outcomes, have focused on a single age group, and included short durations of follow-up, precluding
examination of long-term impact of neighborhood environments on development of regular PA habits and
weight status across the lifespan. This proposed study addresses these limitations by efficiently leveraging
existing data from 5 existing NIH-funded studies to investigate prospective associations between neighborhood
environment features and physical activity in 4 age groups (children, adolescents, adults, and older adults). A
key innovation is the ability to examine similarities and differences in environment—health associations across
the lifespan. Each existing study involves cross-sectional data but the shared participants and measures
across studies allows for the investigation of long-term prospective associations over two assessment time
points 5-15 years apart. We will investigate in 1083 participants whether and how baseline neighborhood
environment features (using GIS-based and reported measures) and changes in reported neighborhood
environment features over time relate to changes in participants’ accelerometer-derived total physical activity,
self-reported physical activity for transport and leisure, and weight status. The GIS-based measures are based
on best practices in neighborhood walkability research and include residential density, land use mix, street
connectivity, retail floor area ration, and a walkability index, as well as park density (playability) and transit
density (transitability). The self-report measures capture additional widely used constructs such as pedestrian
facilities, crime safety, traffic safety, and aesthetics. The age groups captured involve critical transition time
points (e.g., into adolescence, young adulthood, and retirement) when understanding predictors of changes in
physical activity are particularly important. The analytic approaches used will identify whether associations
differ across age groups, sex, race/ethnicity, and education status. The findings will be critical in strengthening
the evidence base on neighborhood environment impacts on health to better guide policy and practice around
cardiovascular disease prevention and control. Results will be widely communicated to researchers as well as
practice and policy audiences."

The purpose of this renewal application is for funding of the existing University of Pennsylvania
(UPENN) Occupational & Environmental Medicine (OEM) Residency. The program, in existence
since 1997, designed to train up-to eight first-year trainees (OM-1) and six second-year trainees
(OM-2) annually. Trainees are practicing physicians making a mid-career change to the
specialty of OEM and admitted to the External Track (ET) as well as recent medical school
graduates who are eligible for admittance to the Internal Track (IT). The ET, train-in-place track,
helps overcome barriers that deter otherwise motivated physicians from specialist training. ET
residents work full-time as OEM physicians at an approved clinical training site (CTS)
supervised by an American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM) certified physician. IT
residents, more recent medical school graduates, rotate at the UPENN and affiliated
organizations such as the Philadelphia Veterans’ Administration Hospital, as well as
governmental agencies and industry. The overall purpose is to graduate 30 trainees over the 5-
year grant period, including 10 NIOSH supported. The specific measurable objectives are to
help increase the nation’s primary care workforce, increase diversity in health professions
programs and the health workforce across the country, develop our residents to be teachers of
prevention and equip them to work with medically underserved populations. We work towards
continuous improvement of the training curricula to iteratively meet the needs of our residents
and of the workforce. Qualified applicants have completed at least 1 clinical year and have a
Master of Public Health or equivalent degree, or a plan for completing the degree before
graduation, in keeping with American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)
requirements. The program provides 2 interrelated components: the applied clinical component
at the CTS and a didactic component that requires monthly 3-day sessions at UPENN: 12
didactic sessions during the first year and 5 during the second year. Both components work in
tandem to allow acquisition of the ACGME and allows trainees eligibility for the ABPM-
Occupational Medicine examination. As the largest civilian OEM residency in the US, with an
average of 7 residents each academic year, we currently have 8 residents in training. As of
June 2023, we have 165 alumni/graduates. Graduates pursue careers in the advanced clinical
and administrative practice of OEM. Generally, over 90% of our trainees remain in the field of
OEM."

national public health goals."
10974965,"Project Summary/Abstract
A major form of communication between cells, including the nervous system, is the release of small, chemical
factors, like neuropeptides (NPs) and hormones. These molecules are used for communication both on a local
level and at a systemic level, where they regulate and mediate developmental, physiological, and behavioral
events. Molecules like neuropeptides are packaged in specialized cellular compartments called Dense Core
Vesicles (DCVs). Despite decades of research, little is known about the in vivo biology of DCVs, from the
mechanism governing their sorting into appropriate cargo, to how they are properly processed into mature
bioactive peptides, to how they undergo release from cells. There are hundreds of different NPs in the human
brain, most with completely unique cellular and physiological impacts. Some of society’s most severe and
debilitating diseases and conditions including neurodegenerative and neurological disorders result from
abnormalities in the packaging or release of these molecules. The long-term objective of this research seeks to
understand the molecular machinery regulating the synthesis, sorting, trafficking, and release of NPs from DCVs.
To initially investigate this process, we created 14 different transgenically tagged NP Drosophila fly lines to
directly visualize the intracellular localization, sorting, trafficking, and release of neuropeptides from neurons in
an in vivo system. We initially uncovered evidence that individual NPs are sorted on an mRNA level to regulate
the identity of each DCV. In Aim 1 we propose to solidify this result by creating several new transgenic fly lines
using the most novel and modern cloning approaches like tissue specific CRISPR and newly created fluorescent
tags like mScarlett3. This approach will tag endogenous NPs within the genome and facilitate a real-time
examination of their sorting, trafficking, and release mechanisms when combined with out high-resolution-ultra
fast fluorescence microscopy. Aims 1 and 2 use genetic, biomolecular, cloning, electrophysiological and
pharmacological approaches combined with confocal and live imaging in an in vivo system to define the proteins
and processes involved in NP sorting in the trans-Golgi network. We predict that the complex of proteins found
on each DCV is unique to the NP within, and this NP-dependent protein complex defines the machinery used for
downstream trafficking and release. We have identified a subset of proteins known to regulate trafficking and
release (e.x. synaptotagmin) and will genetically alter the structure of these proteins to identify their roles.
Mutations in synaptotagmins in humans lead to severe neurodegenerative and neurological disorders like
Alzheimer’s. These studies will greatly advance our comprehension of NP sorting and illuminate the proteins and
pathways controlling their trafficking and release from neurons."
10974916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), chronic stress, and isolation increase the odds of misusing opioids. In
treatment-seeking people with opioid use disorder, exposure to more types of childhood trauma was inversely
correlated with age at opioid initiation. Thus, people with ACEs begin misusing opioids earlier than people without
ACEs. Current medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs) significantly reduce overdose and instances of
relapse. However, MOUDs are not sufficient. The number of synthetic opioid overdose deaths continues to rise
and instances of OUD are climbing, illustrating the serious public health burden. Alternative medications that
have unique non-opioid mechanisms of action could increase recovery and mitigate the abuse potential of
prescription opioids. The serotonin (5-HT) system is richly expressed in many areas that modulate opioid reward
and is dynamically altered by stress and adverse experiences. The 5-HT system and the receptors that transduce
the signal are densely expressed in the mesocorticolimbic regions in human and rodent brains and modulate
reinforcement learning. Specifically, the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR) seem to have
opposing effects within the mesocorticolimbic pathway and areas of the mPFC. However, new preliminary data
from our research group identifies that a preferential 5-HT2AR partial agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine
(DOI) reduces the reinforcing value of oxycodone in a novel, translationally relevant model of fentanyl self-
administration. The ongoing opioid crisis calls for novel treatment strategies and innovative approaches to
address the opioid epidemic. Furthermore, there is a critical need to determine how ACEs and chronic stress
alter the rewarding aspects of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms that
are altered during development and have downstream effects on opioid reinforcement helps to predict or identify
at-risk groups who are more vulnerable to OUD. This application seeks support to investigate these mechanisms
to ultimately reveal a novel and innovative neuropharmacological mechanism and identify a non-opioid receptor
target to control opioid reinforcement. This project has the potential to strengthen the research environment at
the University of Nebraska at Omaha by recruiting and exposing undergraduate students to translationally
relevant models of OUD. In addition, the undergraduate students will be incorporated into all aspects of the
proposed research projects to deliver a truly experiential training opportunity that fosters independent growth
and professional development. Students engaged in this project will communicate their research projects through
conference presentations and publications. At the end of this project, our primarily undergraduate research team
will have determined the therapeutic utility of the 5-HT2AR in fentanyl reinforcement, characterized the expression
of 5-HT2AR expression in the rodent brain, and determined the extent to which the medial prefrontal cortex
encodes fentanyl value and each student will have acquired necessary neuroscience-related skills that will surely
be attractive to graduate programs to which they will apply."
10974778,"Leishmania parasites alternate between extracellular promastigotes in sandfly midgut and intracellular
amastigotes in mammals. These protozoan parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality due to the lack
of a vaccine, limitations of vector control, and inadequacy of drugs. The long-term goal of this project is to
elucidate the roles of lipid metabolism in Leishmania survival and infection. Understanding how parasites
acquire essential lipids from the mammalian host will shed new light into Leishmania-host interaction and the
findings may lead to novel drug targets and drug candidates. The previous funding period focused on how
Leishmania parasites generate phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) including plasmalogen PE and diacyl PE. A key
finding is that the enzyme ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EPCT) is essential for both the
promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania major. EPCT is required for the de novo synthesis of PE via the
Kennedy pathway. The essentiality of EPCT in the pathogenic amastigote stage is likely due to the high
demand of plasmalogen PE in amastigotes, and the lack of plasmalogen PE scavenging from the mammalian
host. Another important finding from the previous funding period is that intracellular amastigotes contain an
unusually high level of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso PC) which has only one fatty acyl chain on the glycerol
backbone. In most eukaryotes, lyso PC is a minor lipid component with signaling roles in several processes
including intracellular calcium homeostasis, cell migration, inflammation, and apoptosis. Lyso PC also
possesses membrane permeabilization activity and promotes positive membrane curvature due to its inverted
cone shape. The objective of the next funding period is to determine how Leishmania amastigotes
acquire lyso PC and elucidate its functions. Based on our understanding of Leishmania lipid metabolism,
we hypothesize that amastigotes acquire lyso PC by hydrolyzing host PC with a parasite-derived
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and efficient lyso PC production is required for their intracellular proliferation. Two
specific aims will be pursued concurrently to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will characterize the molecular
machinery involved in lyso PC metabolism in L. major amastigote using molecular biology approaches. Aim 2
will explore the origin and impact of amastigote lyso PC on Leishmania-macrophage interactions. These
proposed studies are designed based on published and unpublished work from the previous funding period
and are well within the research team’s area of expertise. Successful completion of these aims will lead to new
insight into the interaction between Leishmania amastigotes and mammalian host. The findings will also help
identify novel drug targets on lyso PC metabolism and understand the mechanism of action for miltefosine, a
non-hydrolysable lyso PC analog and the only oral drug to treat leishmaniasis. Finally, the renewal application
will allow us to continue expanding the research capacity at Texas Tech University driven by undergraduate
and graduate students."

The transformative breakthrough of Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 on the reliability of sequence to protein
structure prediction, demonstrated the power of machine learning approaches in advancing the study and
engineering of proteins. Currently a number of inverse protein folding neural network models employ different
objective functions in the design of proteins which come with trade-offs and can lead to adversarial sequence
predictions. This project seeks to apply a different objective function to overcome limitations of current inverse
protein folding models with the specific goal of predicting mutations that will increase the stability of therapeutic
and diagnostic proteins. Additionally, AI- and Physics-based Simulation filters are integrated to enable the
prediction of sequences that increase stability and retain function. It is hypothesized that by combining these AI
tools with the experimental cell-free protein synthesis and stability/activity assays, rapid design-build-test-learn
cycles can be performed to create AI models tuned specifically for the target protein. This technology is directly
applied to the highly sensitive diagnostic reporter protein NanoLuc and the promising cancer therapeutic
Onconase to expand their utility through enhanced stability."
10973862,"ABSTRACT
Cancer has been characterized as a chronic, poorly healing wound where inflammatory and proliferative
processes continue unchecked without normal healing and resolution of inflammation. In one sense, cancer
represents an imbalance of pro-inflammatory over pro-resolving processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), we
propose this pro-inflammatory imbalance may be driven by arachidonic acid (AA)-rich Western diets and
associated downstream lipid metabolism. The role of AA in cancer development and progression, however, is
still controversial when in vitro, in vivo, and human data are considered. Our preliminary LC-MS/MS data
suggest a disordered lipoxygenase pathway CRC lipid metabolism, where AA, its derivatives (e.g, LTB4, 5-
HETE), and principal genes (e.g., ALOX5, ALOX5AP) are largely over-expressed in tumor vs. normal samples.
Recent in vivo murine data suggest dead cancer cell membranes (apoptotic debris), commonly generated from
rapidly growing or treated tumors, may be the main source of AA that promotes tumor growth. Surprisingly,
single cell RNASEQ data suggest the majority of AA lipid modulating genes are expressed in the immune cells
of the tumor microenvironment (TME) rather than in the tumor cells themselves, suggesting a role for AA in
regulating the immune TME. Moreover, our preliminary analysis of > 2000 CRCs suggest the immune activity
of the TME is a strong predictor of long-term CRC survival. The recent proliferation of checkpoint inhibitors has
fully demonstrated the potential to modulate the TME to enable cancer cures. Understanding precisely how
disordered AA lipid metabolism impacts the immunity of the CRC TME is thus a critical unmet need that could
lead to novel therapeutic approaches for CRC based on lipid metabolism and signaling. Here we propose to:
1) add a novel feature of quantified AA pathway lipid mediators to a large “reference” set of human highly
clinically- and molecularly curated CRCs. We will determine their ability to distinguish, and possibly refine,
subclasses defined by: a) consensus molecular subtyping (CMS) with enriched vs. diminished immune TMEs;
b) TME immune activation scores; c) CRC genotypes; 2) assess the effect of AA-based pro-inflammatory vs.
pro-resolution mediators on paired, isogeneic patient derived organoids (PDOs), with and without intact
immune TMEs, to clarify mechanisms of action; 3) define the role of AA and ALOX5 in tumor growth and
metastatic progression in a murine, syngeneic CRC orthotopic model. We will anchor the experimental plan on
AA supplementation resembling the Western diet in order to demonstrate its inflammatory effects on CRC.
These aims will decipher the potential of regulating AA and its lipid derivatives as a novel therapeutic approach
to enhance the immune activity of the TME."
10973890,"ABSTRACT
The efficacy of cell-based immunotherapies in treating solid tumors is hampered due to challenges
pertaining to infiltration, function, and persistence of CD8+ effector T cells. The tumor microenvironment
(TME) is designed to favor tumor survival and depletes key nutrients from the extracellular space, creating
a hostile environment unamenable to CD8+ effector function. Regulatory T (Tregs) cells can thrive in the
glucose-low TME due to their adaptable metabolic re- wiring which promotes survival of Tregs and
facilitates their suppression of effector immune cells. High frequency of Tregs in the TME is associated
with reduced response to immunotherapies, increased malignancy and poor clinical outcome.
Metabolic dysfunction in the tumor not only supports the survival of immunosuppressive cells but drives
an accumulation of metabolic byproducts that are secreted into the interstitial fluid of the TME where they
can act as signaling molecules communicating with neighboring cells, driving suppressive phenotypes.
Succinate is a critical mitochondrial metabolite that is secreted from the tumor due to an intracellular
buildup in the hypoxic conditions of the TME. We have identified that extracellular succinate promotes
the induction of Tregs from CD4+ T cells and further enhances the Th1-suppressing phenotype of Tregs.
We propose that by inhibiting the effects of succinate on Treg induction and phenotype, targeting
succinate signaling - specifically the succinate receptor (SUCNR1) - in CD4+ T cells and Tregs, we can
increase the number of tumor-specific TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells that infiltrate the solid tumor thereby
enhancing the anti-tumor response and reducing tumor burden. We will test this using tumors that have
modified succinate levels (using CRISPR/Cas9), small molecule antagonists for the SUCNR1 on CD4+
T cells and WT and SUCNR1-/- CD4+ T cells, and comprehensively assess the effects of tumor-derived
succinate on Treg induction in the TME. Utilizing our in-house high avidity TCRs that recognize the tumor
antigens MAGE-A1 and PRAME, will subsequently develop a therapeutic strategy targeting succinate
signaling to attenuate the suppressive effects of Tregs on tumor-specific CD8+ effector T cell anti-tumor
responses, using SUCNR1-/- T cells and a small molecule inhibitor targeting succinate. We will examine
this in vivo using advanced humanized mouse models (MISTRG) that support myeloid cells thus creating
an immune diverse TME. We will simultaneously use a murine melanoma immune competent model
(B16OVA OT-1) to interrogate the effects of succinate on immunosuppression on the TME. These studies
will provide a novel and innovative therapeutic strategy for combating the resident and infiltrating
suppressive Tregs in the TME and increase the efficacy of TCR immunotherapy outcomes in the solid
tumor."

Project Summary/Abstract
The Industrial Hygiene Program from the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, is submitting an
application for renewal of the NIOSH Training Grant “University of Puerto Rico – Caribbean Center for
Professional Industrial Hygiene Training.”
The Training Program Grant (TPG) requested proposes, as a main goal, to train approximately 50 students
enrolled in the UPR Master of Science in Industrial Hygiene Program, in the period starting in July of 2024 and
ending in June of 2029. Each appointment will have a duration of 24 months. The UPR Industrial Hygiene
Program curriculum was reviewed and revised in the recent past, to include emergency management,
occupational toxicology, and three 1-credit laboratory courses on occupational sampling, physical risks
evaluation and control, and chemical risks evaluation and control, respectively, resulting in a stronger curriculum
in industrial hygiene, with a total of 51 credits in industrial hygiene courses, combined with 15 credits in core
public health courses. The curriculum proposed culminates with 480 hours of internship, in an occupational
environment, to allow the students to sediment the knowledge acquired during their studies in industrial hygiene.
Recruiting efforts for the IH program have been reviewed, and now are conducted by direct contact with specific
candidates from biology and chemistry, as well as industrial and environmental engineering programs in Puerto
Rico, with the collaboration of students (trainees) who visit the academic institutions where they graduated in
undergraduate programs, to promote an increase in applications to the UPR IH Program, at the same time
promoting inclusion. The response has been very good, although applications for enrollment in higher education
institutions, both public and private, have decreased in the past three years in Puerto Rico. For the current
academic period of 2023/2024, seven students were admitted, short of the program goal of ten admissions per
year. However, the graduation rate is high, usually above 80%. In addition to continuing and enhancing the
efforts reported in this paragraph, the IH program has officially established a part-time curricular sequence that
can be completed in three years, and is attractive to candidates that work full-time, increasing the reach of the
program.
The overall objective of this requested grant is to continue providing Puerto Rico and the continental United
States with highly trained industrial hygienists, proficient in both the Spanish and the English languages. The
graduates of the UPR Industrial Hygiene program are in high demand. As an example, out of nine students who
graduated in June of 2023, eight have reported that are employed as industrial hygienists, one in the United
Staes, and seven in Puerto Rico; one did not respond to our request for information.
The graduate degree in industrial hygiene at UPR does not require a thesis. However, program faculty are almost
continuously developing projects, both funded and not, which provide opportunities for students to engage in
research. Students also participate in academic activities. For example, we currently have a second year student
working as a TA to provide mentoring in biostatistics, a five-credit core course required for newly admitted
students.
The UPR IH Program has an advisory Committee, with five components from the industrial hygiene sector, and

10974893,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a major form of dementia, starts with synaptic dysfunction and progresses to massive
neurodegeneration. Mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) that increase amyloid plaque (one of the two
AD hallmarks) are found in the very rare familial AD (fAD, a.k.a. early-onset AD or EOAD). The discoveries of
mutations in PSEN1/2 that make amyloid peptides from APP reinforce the amyloid hypothesis, positing that A
(-amyloid peptide) aggregation causes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. There are many other risk
factors have been discovered through genomic screen of thousands of patients with sporadic AD (sAD),
highlighting that the cause of AD is likely multifactorial. Early studies about APP led to various theories about its
functions, ranging from neurodevelopment to apoptosis. But the link between APP and AD remains elusive other
than A. Very recently, our work in mouse neurons led to an intriguing discovery – APP and cholesterol (Chol)
are inversely correlated in the plasmalemma of presynaptic terminals. Moreover, point mutations within APP’s
Chol-interactive motif (CIM) causes APP increase and Chol decrease at the plasmalemma of axon terminals.
Chronically, those mutations led to abnormality in synaptic vesicles (SVs), swollen synapses, disintegrated axons
and tau hyperphosphorylation. Hence, we postulate that APP regulates presynaptic Chol and that APP mutations
triggers neurodegeneration by disrupting neuronal Chol homeostasis. In fact, a lot of evidence supports a close
tie between Chol and AD: (1) ApoE4, the highest genetic risk factor for sAD is an isoform of Apolipoprotein E
and it often accompany with abnormal lipid metabolism in the brain; (2) brain Chol metabolism declines during
aging, the primary risk factor for AD; (3) mutations found in Niemann-Pick Type C1 disease interferes with Chol
supply to plasmalemma and cause “juvenile AD” phenotype in the mouse model; (4) APP intracellular domain
cleaved off by -secretase serves as a suppressor for the expression of lipoprotein receptor; (5) both APP and
Chol are concentrated at axon terminals and crucial for synaptic plasticity, the biological basis for learning and
memory. Here, we will test the hypothesis that mutations affecting APP distribution, trafficking, and interaction
with Chol triggers synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration via disrupted presynaptic Chol homeostasis. To
do so, we will use human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent cells (hiNs) for better clinical relevance.
Methodologically, we will employ new imaging tools and electrophysiological recording] to systematically
investigate APP, Chol, synaptic transmission, plasticity and cell pathology. If successful, this project will provide
new insights about APP’s intrinsic function, the importance of presynaptic Chol, and, more importantly, the cause
of AD, which will lend a hand to new therapeutic strategies for AD."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy. Treatment usually involves a proteasome inhibitor,
dexamethasone, and an immunomodulatory or chemotherapeutic treatment, with or without autologous stem
cell transplantation. Because of intrinsic or acquired medication resistance, all myeloma patients eventually
relapse. The expression of the prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family, particularly Mcl-1, is a key process in
the survival of myeloma cells. Because Mcl-1 is a critical mediator of disease progression and an important
mechanism in the acquisition of resistance to therapy it is reasonable to ask if MM patients, particularly those
at relapse, would benefit from an Mcl-1-targeted therapy? A few selective Mcl-1 inhibitors are currently being
developed or are being tested in clinical trials, but unfortunately, most of the previous studies were terminated
because of undesirable side effects, especially cardiac toxicity. To address this need, we developed a novel
Mcl-1 inhibitor, KS18, to investigate the mechanistic underpinning of Mcl-1 role in MM, and to determine
feasibility of Mcl-1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the rationale for this research is to determine
whether our novel Mcl-1 inhibitor can be used along with the existing chemotherapeutic agents to effectively kill
resistant myeloma cells, thus, inhibit or prevent MM relapse. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that unlike
chemotherapy, KS18 kills resistant cells, suggesting that it could be combined with traditional chemotherapy to
treat MM while minimizing the possibility of resistance development more effectively. To evaluate the efficacy
and the likely mechanism of action of KS18 in combination with existing MM treatments, we propose the
following Specific Aims: First, is inhibiting Mcl-1 via KS18 sufficient to reverse the acquired chemotherapeutic
resistance in MM in vitro? We will test KS18 alone and in combination with therapeutic agents used in
treatment of MM, including with bortezomib, venetoclax or as a third agent in combination with bortezomib and
dexamethasone, which is part of clinical standard of care for MM patients. Second, can Mcl-1 inhibition
reverse bortezomib resistance in MM in vivo? We will determine how Mcl-1 inhibition modulates the acquired
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and third, what is the efficacy of Mcl-1 inhibitor and bortezomib
combination in refractory and relapsed patient samples? We will investigate the efficacy of the KS18 and
bortezomib combination in patient samples. These significant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of
targeting anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in MM as well as other cancers for modulating relapse, providing needed
preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation. This contribution will be significant because it is
expected to have broad translational importance in the treatment of MM. Furthermore, this proposal will
enhance the infrastructure of research and education at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University
(CMSRU), offering biochemical and biomedical research experiences to underserved minority students, who
would otherwise lack such opportunities."
10974336,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The coordinated and regulated remodeling of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is required for cell migration
for developmental processes and homeostatic maintenance, as well as during the body’s response to external insults and
disease states including heart disease and tumor metastasis. During cell migration, actin filaments assemble and become
linked to focal adhesion (FA) complexes, while MTs undergo dynamic instability that is locally controlled by MT-
associated proteins (MAPs). These two processes enable cells to establish a leading-edge and a trailing-edge, and to
migrate with directional persistence. Despite many advances in our understanding of the functional implications of MAPs
on MTs and MT-FA interactions, it remains unknown how exactly MT organization is spatially and temporally
coordinated with FAs to promote directional cell movement. A critical discovery, that non-centrosomal MTs are both
sufficient and required to drive polarized cell migration, suggests that non-centrosomal MTs are primed to function in a
way that is distinct from MTs nucleated by the centrosome. This finding underscores the need to determine how
cytoskeletal proteins identify and regulate non-centrosomal versus centrosomal MT dynamics and effects on polarity and
migration. This gap in knowledge impacts our understanding of fundamental processes, including how signaling
molecules simultaneously regulate families of proteins to achieve complex tasks, such as guiding persistent cell migration.
The small GTPase, Rac1, is a key signaling protein that is spatially controlled to promote FA formation, MT growth, and
actin filament assembly, resulting in leading edge advance. Rac1 signaling is complemented by the molecular motor
protein, myosin-II, which organizes actin stress fibers, promotes FA maturation, and generates forces that pull the trailing-
edge of the cell forward. Thus, Rac1 and myosin-II are spatially and temporally controlled to drive directional cell
movement. We recently discovered that another family or MAPs, termed septins, respond to Rac1activity by relocating
adjacent to FAs, where septins reorient non-centrosomal MT polymerization into FAs and drive FA disassembly and
directed migration. Collectively, these findings point to functionally and spatially distinct roles for centrosomal and non-
centrosomal MT-mediated regulation of FA dynamics and directed cell motility. Here, we will test the hypothesis that
Rac1 and myosin-II promote FA-localized membrane curvature to recruit septin, that polyglutamylation of non-
centrosomal MTs promotes septin-MT interactions and FA disassembly, and that FA-tethered centrosomal MTs function
to deliver matrix remodeling cargo to FAs. Our approach will incorporate a team of undergraduate researchers using
fluorescence microscopy of live endothelial cells to determine: (1) how Rac1 signaling and actin-myosin contractility
regulate septin localization adjacent to FAs, (2) how septins functionally distinguish centrosomal MTs from non-
centrosomal MTs, and (3) whether/how centrosomal and non-centrosomal MTs work together to promote FA disassembly
and directed cell migration. These investigations will provide critical advances to the field of cell migration by
functionally linking Rac1 and myosin-II with cytoskeletal effector proteins that regulate centrosomal and non-centrosomal
MT behaviors to control FA dynamics and cell migration in health and disease."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease triggered by genetics and environmental factors. In particular, the gut microbiota has been implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Bacterial colonization modifies islet autoimmunity in mice. Changes in microbial composition and diversity have also been reported in children who developed T1D. Microbes have been proposed to drive autoimmunity via molecular mimicry, where microbial exposure triggers an inappropriate response from self-reactive T cells recognizing a similar appearing microbial antigen. However, autoreactive T cells and cross-reactive recognition are not limited to disease; they are also present in a healthy immune repertoire. How autoimmune pathology arises from these physiologic interactions remains unknown. In collaboration with the NIDDK Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) at the University of Pennsylvania, we examined CD4+ T cells isolated from the duodenum and pancreatic islets of recent onset T1D and healthy organ transplant donors. CD4+ lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) in T1D patients, including those recognizing commensal bacteria, exhibited altered responses to stimulation. Concurrent TCR sequence analyses on commensal-reactive T cells further showed a broader pattern of antigen-recognition in T1D patients. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that T cells in autoimmune patients are more cross-reactive, potentially enabling inappropriate commensal responses to target self-antigens. Because T1D-associated gene signatures can be detected before clinical diagnosis and are present in circulating T cells, we further propose that tissue pathology can be detected in peripheral blood to offer new opportunities for early detection and intervention. In Aim 1, we will define cross-reactivity between microbial and self-antigens and test the hypothesis that T1D and at-risk individuals have a broader breadth of T cell recognition. In Aim 2, we will build on our findings in the LPL to identify key properties of gut-associated T cell responses in the blood. Our goal is to identify novel cellular biomarkers for T1D. PBMCs from TrialNet, collected at various stages of islet autoimmunity before disease onset, will be used to identify key immune signatures that can predict disease onset and progression. Data generated from this study will provide fundamental knowledge on the underlying immune pathology in T1D and may uncover new biomarkers for islet autoimmunity. The proposed research will therefore have a broad impact on T1D research."
10974352,"Project Summary
Sexual dimorphisms associated with immunity and autoimmunity are well described. In some instances, these
differences have been attributed in part to estradiol or androgen hormone production and signaling; however,
while mechanistic data relating steroids to immune function are emerging, there are still significant gaps in our
knowledge. Our lab became interested in estrogen effects on the immune system as a result of our work on an
unusual disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). LAM is a rare cystic lung disease found almost
exclusively in women. The cystic lung changes are caused by small multifocal smooth muscle cell clusters in
the lungs that contain mutations in one of the two tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes. In patients, LAM is highly
estrogen sensitive, as it worsens with puberty, pregnancy, and oral contraception, and stabilizes after
menopause. To explain the remarkable female predominance of LAM, as well as its estrogen sensitivity, we
proposed that LAM smooth muscle cells in the lungs may originate from the myometrium of the uterus. In fact,
when we knocked out TSC2 expression in the uterus, all mice developed aggressive myometrial growth that
resembled LAM, with 50% developing lung myometrial nodules from the uterus later in life. Mouse TSC2-null
uteri were highly sensitive to estradiol, as growth was eliminated with oophorectomy or aromatase inhibitor
treatment. In contrast, isolated LAM cells from these mouse uteri, as well as other TSC2-null cells, had little
estradiol sensitivity in vitro, suggesting that, in vivo, estradiol promotes LAM progression indirectly.
Accordingly, we find that estradiol via ERα stimulates innate immunity in mice by promoting neutrophil
production in the bone marrow. We have further shown that neutrophils stimulate TSC2-null myometrial cell
growth in large part through the release of neutrophil elastase (NE). Finally, we find that estradiol stimulates
expression of a melanocytic marker, GPNMB, and define it as a novel LAM serum biomarker that also serves
as a potential therapeutic target. Here we propose to examine the mechanisms by which estradiol enhances
neutrophil production in the bone marrow, as well as how estradiol and neutrophils act locally within the TSC2-
null myometrium to promote LAM progression. We will also examine how estradiol-induced GPNMB modulates
TSC2-null tumor cell growth, focusing on its possible actions as a T-cell suppressor. This work will uncover
novel mechanisms of estradiol-mediated changes in immunity that will apply to all aspects of biology, from
tumor physiology to infectious diseases to autoimmunity."
10974353,"This research will define and validate guidelines for interpretation of commonly used patient-reported
outcome measures (PROMs) for pain and physical function domains among patients with advanced knee
osteoarthritis (OA) receiving medical, rehabilitation, or surgical treatment. The Framingham OA study
found that 33% of men and 42% of women have radiographic changes consistent with knee OA. While x-ray
changes do not correlate with symptom severity, validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can
quantify knee OA pain severity, longitudinal symptom changes, and OA-associated functional limitations in
groups of patients. Thus, professional societies endorse PROM use in knee OA and CMS will mandate PROM
capture and reporting for all knee OA patients electing total knee replacement (TKR) by 2027. Today’s electronic
health records can capture knee-OA PROMs for use in clinical care, yet sparse evidence exists to guide PROM
interpretation in individual patients. This research will generate guidelines tailored to the common comorbidities
of knee OA patients who are likely to be older, obese, and have multiple physical and emotional comorbidities
that influence pain and physical function. Study feasibility and efficiency is supported by the use of two existing
cohorts: (1) the NIAMS-funded Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort (n=4700) and (2) a 12-site cohort of patients
evaluated for TKR (n=4000; PCORI). Both cohorts include identical OA-specific and universal PROMs captured
at initial evaluation and 12 months with varied treatments; demographic and social factors; and medical,
emotional, and musculoskeletal comorbidities. An interdisciplinary team of knee OA experts and stakeholders
will review the clinical utility of statistical PROM interpretation guidelines to generate dissemination tools for use
in clinical care. The Specific Aims include: Aim 1. Define PROM interpretation guidelines specific to patient
attributes and comorbidities, as needed, for both knee OA pain and physical function domains to inform non-
operative and TKR interpretation of symptom changes. Analyses will use existing data with the commonly used
OA-specific (KOOS, WOMAC) and universal PROMs (SF36, VR12, PROMIS), and self-evaluated transitions
(pre-to-one-year post TKR). Patients with key comorbidities (e.g., widespread pain, poor emotional health,
cardiopulmonary conditions) and diverse attributes (sex, age, race and ethnicity) will be examined. Aim 2.
Validate pain and physical function PROM interpretation guidelines in a prospective sample of knee OA
patients (n=800) and assess PROMs bi-monthly for 12 months to define improvement trajectories. Aim 3.
Evaluate use and adoption of knee OA PROM interpretation guidelines through the prospective sample of
orthopedic clinicians and their patients to serve future implementation. As PROMs are adopted widely, these
guidelines will support consistent PROM interpretation and will inform future knee OA clinical care and research."
10974233,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration via the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS).
They are also centers of cellular redox chemistry because respiration is made up of a series of electron transfer
reactions. Even though the mitochondrial DNA encodes essential OXPHOS components, the vast majority of the
structural subunits and additional bioenergetics factors are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytoplasm
and utilize sophisticated import machineries (aka translocons) to reach their final destinations. An important and
large pool of proteins within the mitochondrial proteome are thiols; cysteine (Cys) containing proteins that perform
key functions of protein import and OXPHOS biogenesis and highly relevant in the pathology of a spectrum of
diseases. Redox (reduction-oxidation) regulation of these Cys proteins is thus relevant to their protein activity and
highly significant for overall mitochondrial function. Thioredoxins are well known to play a role in redox regulation
by reducing disulfide bonds in oxidized proteins in order to restore function. Our central hypothesis is that Aim32,
a thioredoxin-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin mitochondrial protein that belongs to the thioredoxin-superfamily and
localizes to the matrix and Inter membrane space (IMS), has an underlying role in the redox regulation of Cys
proteins with consequential impacts on OXPHOS biogenesis and protein import, specifically the TIM22 import
machinery. However, how these potential substrates of Aim32 are regulated represents a critical barrier to
advancing our understanding of how thiol redox modifications allow for rapid adjustment of mitochondrial protein
function and overall biogenesis. Furthermore, the identification of pathological variants in subunits of the TIM22
complex and OXPHOS that are implicated in several diseases causing mitochondrial myopathy, makes it
imperative to understand mechanisms that regulate OXPHOS and TIM22 biogenesis.
 Using the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, the goal of this undergraduate-
driven proposal is to evaluate our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Delineate Aim32-mediated
mechanisms underlying TIM22 translocon assembly/stability; 2) Identify role of Aim32 in OXPHOS biogenesis;
and 3) Determine functional relevance of Aim32 in the IMS and matrix. The proposed work is innovative because
we seek to investigate how Aim32 mechanistically regulates TIM22 complex assembly (biogenesis) and
bioenergetics (OXPHOS); two fundamental mitochondrial processes that span the mitochondrial IMS and matrix.
Additionally, allocating specific functions to Aim32 within these sub-compartments, is equally important. The
contribution of this work will be significant in that physiological ramifications of these new-founded roles for Aim32
to mitochondrial and cellular function have not been explored and will be clarified. This research will have a broad
impact on public health because these mechanistic studies will provide key insights into how defects in
mitochondrial biogenesis lead to disease."

Abstract
 The goal of the proposed research is to define the mechanisms of ribosome assembly within
mitochondria. While remarkable progress has recently been made towards understanding the structure of
mitoribosomes, the unique pathways and factors that facilitate their biogenesis remains largely unknown.
Dysfunctional mitoribosome assembly abolishes the synthesis of several essential components of the
respiratory chain, which can compromise cellular energy production and generate reactive oxygen species
that promote degenerative disease, aging, and cancer. Thus, a clearer understanding of how these
highly complex macromolecular structures are assembled is necessary to better understand mitochondrial
disease. To gain insight into this process, this proposal will examine how an evolutionarily conserved yeast
protein called Mam33 effectively chaperones a subset of newly imported mitoribosomal proteins and
facilitates their incorporation into the assembling large subunit. This mitoribosomal chaperone contrasts
with those in bacterial and eukaryotic assembly pathways because it binds multiple mitochondrial
ribosomal proteins (MRPs), rather than a single ribosomal protein. This and emerging data suggest that
mitochondria might minimize the complexity of ribosome biogenesis by forming small RNA-free
preassembly blocs complexed with Mam33, rather than the individual addition of MRPs observed for
bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes. The first aim will determine the composition and binding
characteristics of Mam33-MRP preassembly complexes. These experiments will determine 1) the number
and composition of the preassembly complexes, 2) their binding domains and 3) whether they can form
without Mam33. This information will advance our understanding of Mam33 function and mitochondrial
ribosome assembly chaperones in general. The second aim will assess the binding properties of Mam33-
MRP preassembly complexes. These experiments will 1) establish whether Mam33 targets the N-terminal
regions of its mtLSU client proteins, 2) delineate the docking sites for its 5 known mtLSU cargo proteins, 3)
identify potential new interactants and 4) examine Mam33-client protein incorporation at a specific mtLSU
assembly step. Since Mam33 is conserved in eukaryotic organisms, information gained in yeast will be
applicable to human disorders. In human patients, bi-allelic mutations in its ortholog p32/HABP1/gC1qR
cause severe multisystemic defects in mitochondrial energy metabolism, which directly result from
oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies and mitochondrial instability. Furthermore, p32 overexpression
has been detected in nearly all tissue specific forms of cancer and associated with poor prognosis. For
these reasons, understanding the physiological role of this protein in the mitochondrion is timely."

 One of the best methods for identifying novel genes and mutations affecting embryonic development is
forward genetic screening. However, these screens require a large number of animals to be screened to
identify a single novel mutant due to the inefficiency of chemical mutagenesis. Our current R15 finalized a
method for enzymatic generation of CRISPR libraries and used the method to generate sgRNAs targeting all
of, and only, the genes expressed in the developing zebrafish heart. The sgRNA templates were then divided
into eight groups of ten, transcribed, and injected into single-cell zebrafish embryos. Amazingly, all eight pools
showed clear morphological heart phenotypes. Thus, we are applying for this renewal grant to continue work
on the screen. We have identified a gene from the first round of the screen, sytl5. We will describe this gene’s
role in heart development, identify other mutated genes in our screen, and characterize their phenotypes in
detail. We also propose to optimize screen parameters to maximize our efficiency and to apply our CRISPR
library to a tissue-specific gene editing screen. In addition to the novel mutants identified in the screen, this
method will be able to be adapted to any tissue in any species, reducing the resources needed to conduct
forward genetic screens and increase the speed of gene discovery in a number of species and developmental
processes."
10974957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become a widely used method in chemical
synthesis. A recent milestone in Ni catalysis was the advancement of C-N and C-O couplings via
strategic activation of Ni amide and Ni alkoxide intermediates to promote reductive elimination as
the bond-formation step in catalysis. With remarkable success of this strategy in cross couplings of
aryl halides with amines and alcohols, it is desirable to leverage the reactivity of Ni amides and
alkoxides for broad catalytic applications including alkyne additions with amines (hydroamination)
and alcohols (hydroetherification). Such reactions of alkyne hydro(hetero)functionalization create
valuable carbon-heteroatom bonds via atom-efficient combination of abundant building blocks (i.e.
alkynes and amine/alcohols), although their demonstrations in Ni catalysis have been scarce.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to develop nickel-based catalysts for alkyne
hydrofunctionalization reactions assisted by directing groups. The long-term goal of our proposed
research is to advance the general strategy of alkyne hydrofunctionalization for selective and
atom-efficient construction of carbon-heteroatom bonds using abundant building blocks. Our study
is based on the central hypothesis that alkyne-tethered directing groups such as 2-pyridyl moiety
can enhance reaction efficiency, regio- and stereo-selectivity for Ni-catalyzed alkyne
hydroamination and hydroetherification reactions via reactivity modulation of relevant Ni amide and
alkoxide intermediates. We aim to test this hypothesis by conducting experimental and
computational studies on structure-reactivity correlations of proposed organonickel intermediates
guided by Machine Learning. The obtained mechanistic insights will guide the rational design of Ni
catalysts and ancillary ligands for broad-scope alkyne hydrofunctionalization reactions. The
feasibility of this research is demonstrated by our published and unpublished results on several Ni-
catalyzed alkyne hydroamination and hydroetherification reactions.
 This proposal includes Three Specific Aims: (1) To improve the reaction scope and efficiency
of Ni-catalyzed hydroetherification of 2-pyridylalkynes. (2) To advance relevant mechanism
understanding and rational catalyst design guided by Machine Learning. (3) To develop Ni-
catalyzed broad-scope alkyne hydrofunctionalization reactions with directing-group assistance.
 Our proposed research is innovative because it advances alkyne hydrofunctionalization as a
general strategy for Ni-catalyzed carbon-heteroatom bond construction. Results from these studies
are significant because they provide efficient catalytic methods that utilize simple and abundant
building blocks to synthesize nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds of biomedical relevance."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Binge eating (BE) is a transdiagnostic symptom of multiple eating disorders, including binge eating
disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN), that involves the overconsumption of food accompanied by a
sense of having lost control over one’s eating. Individuals who exhibit recurrent binge eating are at
elevated risk for early death, increased psychosocial impairment, and a range of additional psychiatric
and medical problems, including obesity. However, treatments for BED and BN have demonstrated
limited effectiveness, and the pathophysiological bases of these debilitating conditions remains poorly
understood. Given this, there is a critical need to clarify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to
binge eating maintenance. The proposed project will contribute to this endeavor by using ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) and electroencephalography (EEG) to study the relationship between
food cue exposure, food craving, and binge eating, and how these relationships are influenced by
alterations in attention and memory processes. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that
exposure to food cues promotes binge eating episodes via increased food craving. In addition, we will
test the further hypothesis that food cue exposure interacts with food-specific attention and memory
biases to increase food craving and the likelihood of binge eating. Results from this study would provide
critically needed guidance regarding biobehavioral mechanisms of binge-eating behavior, and
illuminate possible treatment targets to help improve the efficacy of interventions for eating disorders."
10974530,"Project Summary
The broad long-term objective of the project concerns the development of novel machine
learning methods and computational tools for modeling genomic data, driven by significant
biological questions and experiments. Analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and
spatial genomic data poses substantial computational and bioinformatics challenges. The
specific aim of the project is to develop novel model-based deep learning methods that
incorporate prior biological information to model scRNA-seq data and spatial genomic data.
These challenges are motivated by the PI’s close collaborations with biomedical investigators.
The proposed approaches are designed to integrate biological information to enhance both
analytical performance and biological interpretability. These methods rely on a novel integration
of biological insights and statistical techniques with deep learning to analyze the noisy, sparse,
and over-dispersed scRNA-seq and spatial genomic data. This integration includes a zero-
inflated negative binomial model, autoencoder, variational autoencoder, and deep embedding.
The new methods can be applied to various essential analytical tasks for the analysis of scRNA-
seq and spatial genomic data, leading to improved interpretability. They will facilitate effective
analyses of the increasingly important scRNA-seq datasets and contribute to the ongoing
studies with which the PI is currently collaborating, such as Paneth cell regulation, regeneration
of human hair follicles, and melanoma. The project will develop practical and feasible computer
programs to implement the proposed methods and evaluate their performance through real
applications. The work outlined in this proposal will provide deep learning methods for modeling
scRNA-seq data and studying complex phenotypes and biological systems, offering insights into
each of the biological areas represented by the various datasets. All programs developed under
this grant, along with detailed documentation, will be made available free of charge to interested
researchers. Undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds will be recruited as an
integral part of the project to implement the most critical aspects of the proposed aims. This
research project aims to stimulate the interests of students, encouraging them to consider a
career in the biomedical sciences."
10975649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide disproportionately affects American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, with the
greatest burden experienced by AI/AN children and adolescents. A paucity of mental health
care resources in AI/AN settings points to a critical need to deliver suicide prevention
interventions outside conventional mental health clinical settings. Past research has shown
cultural protective factor approaches will be more effective than risk- focused interventions to
reduce AI/AN youth suicide. Culturally grounded (or “ground up”) prevention interventions—
which place local culture and values at the forefront of intervention design, implementation, and
evaluation—hold strong promise to prevent AI/AN youth suicide. However, we know little about
core components, mechanisms, and constructs through which culturally grounded interventions
can prevent suicide. The Elders’ Resilience Curriculum (ERC) is a school-based, culturally
grounded, suicide prevention intervention currently delivered by White Mountain Apache Tribe
(WMAT) Elders through monthly lessons about tribal cultural values, beliefs, ways of life, and
Apache language to youth ages 9-14, a nascent stage prior to the highest risk period for suicide
(15-24 years old) in this community. The proposed research builds upon the Johns Hopkins
Center for American Indian Health and WMAT’s 35+ year research and public health
partnership that continues to innovate and scale prevention interventions through community-
based participatory research. The candidate will engage with the tribal-university partners to
conduct an Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods study to identify key suicide protective
factors and ERC core components that target these factors, refine a theoretical model
specifying causal mechanisms and outcomes, develop a culturally adapted assessment battery,
and pilot a rigorous evaluation to test the theoretical model and culturally adapted measures to
prepare for a larger R01 effectiveness study. If successful, new understanding of the
mechanisms and constructs through which ERC operates to prevent AI/AN youth suicide will
support replication and scaling of this intervention to other AI/AN communities suffering youth
suicide disparities. The proposed K01 will provide the candidate, who is from the
Cherokee/Seminole Nations, with critical training in qualitative and mixed methods research,
culturally grounded intervention design and evaluation, and child/adolescent development as it
relates to resiliency, cultural identity, and suicide prevention. The candidate will receive
guidance and targeted training from a mentorship team of national experts at the forefront of
Indigenous mental health prevention science. This K01 award will support her to become an
Indigenous NIMH independent investigator focused on culturally-informed, strengths-based
mental health promotion research. The proposed research and candidate’s career goals align
with NIMH Strategic Objective 4 to “strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported
research” and “identify, validate, and scale-up innovative programs currently in use that improve
mental health services for underserved populations” (4.1)."

resulting in the production of infectious virus for transmission to a new host. Reactivation can result in lesions
at the body surface and encephalitis. In addition, HSV-1 infection in North American is shifting to become more
associated with genital infection, which results in painful lesions, sexual transmission and an enhanced risk of
transmission to neonates. There are currently no therapies that target the latent or reactivation stage of HSV-1
infection. In addition, there is increased viral resistance to current therapeutics along with toxicity associated
with their use. Therefore, new therapies are required that can prevent HSV reactivation. However, to develop
new therapies we need a better understanding of the molecular basis of HSV latency and reactivation.
Because HSV establishes latency in neurons, developing model systems has been a challenge. Current
models largely rely on murine primary neurons, which, while informative, have limitations; they are not easily
scalable and are not of the same host species. Our lab has considerable expertise in creating and
characterizing in vitro models of HSV latency, including the development of a recombinant Stayput-GFP virus
model that allows latency to be established in murine in vitro neurons without requiring anti-viral drugs. We
have also characterized the nature of the chromatin on viral genomes during latency and investigated a
biphasic wave of viral gene expression that is unique to reactivation. Therefore, the goals of this project are to
use our expertise to develop and characterize a model of HSV-1 latency in human sensory neurons
differentiated from a cell line derived from the dorsal root ganglion. Notably, genital HSV-1 infection results in
latency in dorsal root ganglia neurons. The aims are based on our preliminary data indicating that we can
establish latency in this system using Stayput-GFP and induce reactivation using a combination of triggers. In
the first aim, we will comprehensively characterize the system, focusing on viral gene expression, the
epigenetic composition of the viral genome, and the role of a known cell stress pathway in inducing a
reactivation-specific biphasic wave of viral gene expression. In the second aim, we will fully determine the type
of sensory neurons produced and use the system to investigate the epigenetic structures of HSV genomes and
differing abilities to reactivate from different neuronal subtypes. In conclusion, this proposal will result in the
creation of an easily scalable model in human sensory neurons that does not require antiviral drugs to promote
latency establishment. We will also, for the first time, define the epigenetic structure of the viral genome in
human neurons. Finally, we will use clinically relevant inhibitors to determine the contribution of a neuronal cell
stress pathway in exit of HSV from latency in human neurons. Therefore, the work outlined in this proposal will
fill major gaps in the field of Alphaherpesvirus latency by fully characterizing a model system and also identify a
potential therapeutic strategy to prevent reactivation from occurring."
10973768,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since 2017, six CAR-T cell therapies and four hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) therapies have been approved in
the U.S. and E.U. to treat cancers, hemophilia, ALD, MLD, and ADA-SCID. These therapies use a lentivirus (LV)
to efficiently deliver and integrate a therapeutic gene into the host cell genome, but LVs are expensive to produce
and their semi-random genomic integration patterns have been shown to induce cancer in some patients (e.g.,
3/67 patients treated with SkysonaTM). Therefore, while LV is a highly efficient gene delivery vehicle, its
disadvantages have motivated the search for alternative non-viral gene delivery (NVGD) methods.
The goal of this collaborative multi-PI proposal is to develop NVGD methods that are less expensive and safer
than LV, while achieving comparably high levels of transgene expression. In Aim 1, the Bracaglia lab will develop
novel polymeric gene delivery vehicles that maximize the delivery of siRNAs (or other cargoes) to T cells and
HSCs. In Aim 2, Drs. Elmer and Huang will collaborate to discover and test novel drugs that temporarily inhibit
host cell proteins that repress foreign genes. Finally, the Elmer lab will optimize the non-viral integration of
transgenes in Aim 3 by identifying the safest and most effective sites for transgene integration in the T cell and
HSC genomes.
Altogether, these efforts will result in the development of novel NVGD methods that significantly improve a wide
range of current and future gene therapies and provide a holistic research experience in cellular engineering for
at least 18 undergraduate students that will work on this project as part of our Senior Project Studio (SPS), in
which students will work with the PIs on the proposed projects in Aims 1-3 for course credit. In addition, the PIs
will also involve dozens of additional students in the project by designing relevant hands-on research projects
that will be incorporated into six lab and lecture courses that are taught by the PIs."

Our long-term goal is to decrease the weight-related breast cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality among
African American breast cancer survivors. In the R01 application, our overall objective is to determine the real-
world effectiveness of the materials developed during the R34 – Take off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) for African
American Breast Cancer Survivors – on weight. Our central hypothesis is that TOPS for African American Breast
Cancer Survivors will help participants achieve significant weight loss. This hypothesis is based on the following:
1) our preliminary data show that TOPS can help women achieve and maintain significant weight loss; 2) the
materials from the Moving Forward and Lifestyle, Exercise and Nutrition (LEAN) studies, which we are adapting
to add to the TOPS program to create TOPS for African American Breast Cancer Survivors, have been shown
to help breast cancer survivors achieve significant weight loss; and 3) the additional materials will be approved
by African American breast cancer survivors who have already participated in the TOPS program. To plan to test
the central hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims in the R34: 1) Adapt materials from Moving
Forward and LEAN with the input of African American breast cancer survivors; 2) Conduct a pilot test of the new
materials and study processes where we a) recruit participants through the electronic health record; b) convert
from a peer-led to a dietitian-led intervention for the initiation phase; c) transition participants to TOPS chapters
in the community for the maintenance phase; and d) collect data in a virtual setting and in the community. The
proposed research is innovative because for the following reasons: 1) it combines efficacious weight
management programs developed at academic institutions with a low-cost community-based program with
national infrastructure; 2) it transitions participants to a maintenance phase in their communities where they can
receive ongoing support indefinitely; 3) it collects data via Bluetooth scales and at LabCorp sites in their
communities; and 4) to our knowledge, this is the first study to test a sustainable weight management intervention
for African American breast cancer survivors. The proposed research is significant because it will develop the
evidence base for a scalable weight loss intervention among African American breast cancer survivors – a
population with poor breast cancer and cardiovascular disease outcomes. The rationale for this project is that
the successful completion is expected to provide evidence that a community-based, weight loss program with a
national infrastructure can help African American breast cancer survivors manage their weight, which may
decrease their breast cancer recurrence and mortality; reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; and improve their
quality of life."
10973829,"Project Summary/Abstract
 New pharmaceuticals that contain chirality are typically marketed as single enantiomers.
Limitations in enantioselective methods for the synthesis of organic, nitrogen-containing small molecules
can hinder drug development. Ring opening of aziridines and epoxides by nucleophiles are efficient
processes for producing chiral, nitrogen-containing small molecules. Chiral Lewis acid catalysis has
continued to advance for carbon–carbon bond forming reactions. What is not known are stereoselective
methods for aziridine desymmetrization with ester enolate equivalents and enantioselective, palladium-
catalyzed epoxide opening with indoles. The long-term goal is to discover novel stereoselective methods
for biologically-active small molecule synthesis. The overall objective of the proposed research, which is
the next step toward attainment of the long-term goal, is to develop enantioselective alkylation and
arylation reactions by ring opening of strained heterocycles with carbon–carbon bond formation. This is
driven by a central hypothesis that electron-rich carbon nucleophiles possess sufficient reactivity to
produce diverse nitrogen-containing small molecules by stereoselective functionalization of strained
heterocycles. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that completion of this project will
advance new aziridine and epoxide methods for enantioselective small molecule synthesis. Directed by
strong preliminary data, the research plan includes objectively testing the central hypothesis and,
thereby, attaining the objective of this application by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Produce
single enantiomer amine derivatives by aziridine opening with enolate equivalents, and 2) Develop
catalytic, enantioselective epoxide openings for the synthesis of chiral nitrogen synthons. The aims will
operate with the working hypotheses that 1) enantioselective and diastereoselective aziridine opening
with enolate equivalents will generate single enantiomer nitrogen-containing small molecules and 2)
diphosphine–palladium (II) complexes possess novel reactivity for enantioselective carbon–carbon bond
formation through epoxide ring opening with nitrogen heterocycles to enable a stereospecific oxidative
1,2-alkyl shift, making this approach innovative. The expected outcomes of our specific aims are as
follows: first, synthesis of enantioenriched -amino carbonyls and indoline derivatives for testing by the
NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program; second, provide advanced, individual research
opportunities for undergraduate students with applications in the biomedical field; third, developing new
catalytic, enantioselective reactions utilizing strained heterocycles. These outcomes will have a
significant positive impact as unique single enantiomer small molecules will become available for
pharmaceutical synthesis. Original chemical processes will be developed to generate valuable new
disease treatments to enhance human health."
10973830,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Several genetic variants within immune system genes like APOE, TREM2, BIN1, CR1, etc have been
associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is also evidence showing heavy metals such as cadmium
(Cd) toxicity being associated with AD. Studies have shown that circulatory levels of Cd are significantly
increased in AD patients and Cd levels in urine are associated with AD associated mortality. Next,
neuroinflammatory dysregulation due to viral infection has also been implicated in AD. Evidence for this
includes, discoveries linking a higher load of herpes-viral signatures of post-mortem brain tissues of AD
patients and accelerated beta-amyloid deposition in in-vitro and in-vivo models infected with herpes viruses.
Since then, our team has been studying the role of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in AD using human in-vitro
cerebral organoid (cOrgs) models differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our work led to
the discovery of an AD-specific transcriptomic perturbations signature by HSV-1. We also discovered that
HSV-1 infection of cOrgs upregulated AD markers such as Aβ and phosphorylated Tau. As such, we propose
to use these phenotypes to test the if we can similarly measure such AD-specific phenotypes when cOrgs are
exposed to Cd alone or exposed to Cd in conjunction with HSV-1 infection and test if genetic variation affect
these phenotypes. We plan to select donor lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) carrying various immune related
AD associated genetic variants from the 1000 genomes project as well as the Personal Genome Project for
reprogramming into iPSCs and differentiating into cOrgs. We plan to test similar conditions for all our aims. We
will perform the tests on a single-donor differentiated cOrgs as well as on multiple cOrgs carrying different AD-
genetic variants. We will test and compare between Cd exposed cOrg and unexposed cOrgs. We will test
HSV-1 infected, Cd exposed cOrgs and compare that with just unexposed HSV-1 infected cOrgs. For aim 1,
we plan to perform RNA-sequencing of the cOrgs and test for the AD-specific transcriptomic perturbation
signature upon Cd exposure, with or without HSV-1 infection, and the effect of the genetic variants. For aim 2,
we plan to perform intracellular staining of Aβ, phosphorylated Tau and several cell type specific markers using
flow cytometry and determine if Cd exposure or HSV-1 infection causes significant changes and whether
cOrgs carrying various variants will show differential effects. For aim 3, we plan to interrogate the media for
pro-inflammatory cytokines using multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). By doing so, we
can test if any are released upon Cd exposure or HSV-1 infection and if their effects are different for the
various AD-associated genetic variants. These aims are independent measurements for determining the
relationship between Cd exposure, HSV-1 infection, genetic variation, and AD pathology. Knowing these things
will allow us to understand better the pathology of AD and reveal insights into its genetic and environmental
effects which can lead to novel ways of treating this debilitating neurodegenerative disease."
10974541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The intent of this proposed research is to contribute to the basic understanding of the structure
and function of RNA that is expressed from tandemly repeated regions of the human genome.
Due to recent advances in sequencing of a complete human genome, the tandemly repeated
DNA sequences residing within the centromere and the adjacent regions (the pericentromere)
have only recently been fully characterized. It is known that these abundant tandem repeat
sequences, which constitute 6.2% of the human genome, typically remain silent or are only
expressed at low levels in normal cells. However, in cancer cells, HSATII, a tandemly repeated
pericentric satellite sequence, is aberrantly transcribed into RNA. In these cells, HSATII RNA
accumulates in the nucleus, adjacent to its site of transcription, where it recruits, and potentially
sequesters, nuclear regulatory proteins. While HSATII DNA is found on many different human
chromosomes, only a few of these locations transcribe HSATII RNA, suggesting that the
regulation and sequence composition may vary from one chromosome to another. With the new
resource of a complete sequence map of these pericentric regions, we can now characterize the
chromosomal locations from which HSATII RNA is transcribed in cancer cells for the first time.
In order to study expressed HSATII sequences, long-read sequencing of nuclear expressed
RNA will be mapped to chromosome-specific HSATII variants. It is hypothesized that
expressed HSATII loci will harbor unique sequence motifs. The hypothesis will be tested by
mapping and characterizing expressed chromosome-specific HSATII variants (Aim 1) and by
functional analysis of individual expressed sequence variants in normal cells (Aim 2). The
phenotypic effect of HSATII nuclear accumulation will be accomplished by characterizing the
structure of HSATII RNA and its capacity to bind nuclear regulatory proteins (Aim 3). All of the
proposed research will be conducted by undergraduate students under the close supervision of
the PI, in collaboration with other leaders in genomic and RNA structural analyses. Thus, the
proposed project promises to engage and train undergraduate researchers in innovative
genomics, cytological, and RNA structural probing techniques, which will propel future careers
in genomics and biomedical research."

The use of cobalt-based nanomaterials has increased recently since they have many of the same
attractive properties as other metallic nanoparticles, but appear to be more inert when exposed to cell
cultures. However, as many studies have shown, the use of single cell culture systems for the
assessment of toxicology needs to be advanced because cells do communicate and effect on each
other in living organisms. This proposal focuses on determining the fate, translocation, and toxicology
of cobalt and cobalt oxide nanomaterials using several advanced three-dimensional lung models.
Respiratory exposure is believed to be one of the most likely exposure scenarios during both use and
development of these nanomaterials, so it is important to determine how they interact with respiratory
epithelial and immune cells, as well as the endothelial cells of the gas exchange barrier. In addition,
since studies have suggested that these materials may lead to fibrosis, a pulmonary fibroblast culture
has also been included in this assessment. The goal is to expose these cells for 4-6 weeks
(depending on the stability of the cell culture) using a microfluidics-based artificial lung culture to
ascertain potential long-term effects of chronic cobalt-based nanomaterial respiratory exposure using
standard toxicology testing, microscopy, and RNA-Seq transcriptomics. The goal of this proposal is
two-fold: 1) determining if long-term exposure, or repeated exposures, to cobalt-based nanoparticles
will cause respiratory damage, and 2) exposing undergraduate students from a rural University
comprised heavily of first-generation students, to advanced technologies in the biomedical sciences.
Completion of these goals will allow for a greater understanding to the overall safety concerns for the
use and fabrication of these materials, since inhalation of nanoparticles is the most likely portal of
entry."

In response to the NIH’s (RFA-AG-24-029) interest in understanding the role of immigration on life course
health and aging, the proposed study aims to examine how older immigrants’ cognitive health is shaped by
cognitive reserves and social interactions in the context of senior housing. Foreign-born older immigrants are
at higher cognitive health risks than community-dwelling counterparts due to low cognitive reserves and
immigration-related challenges. Additionally, many older immigrants who reside in ethnically concentrated
senior housing experience both positive and negative social interactions, which may directly impact cognitive
health and also modify the impact of cognitive reserves on cognitive health. Using the compensatory reserve
hypothesis and resource substitution theory as the theoretical framework of the study, we will examine the
independent and interactive effects of cognitive reserves (e.g., education and acculturation) and social
interactions (e.g., bonding, bridging, and bullying) on cognitive health. Three specific aims of the study include:
(1) to examine the effect of cognitive reserves on cognitive health, (2) to examine the effect of social
interactions (bonding, bridging, and bullying) on cognitive health, and (3) to examine whether the impact of
cognitive reserves on cognitive health will be modified by social interactions. Given the distinct but related
nature of the constructs in each domain, we will consider the interactions within each domain (e.g., education X
acculturation, bonding X bullying) and across the domains (e.g., education X bridging, acculturation X bullying).
To pursue the proposed aims, this study will focus on older Korean immigrants living in subsidized senior
housing in Los Angeles. In partnership with Front Porch, a community service organization that manages
affordable housing in the greater Los Angeles area, we will recruit approximately 300 Korean American
residents from four subsidized senior housing facilities with a high proportion of Korean American residents (60
to 80 participants at each site). Data will be collected by using both conventional survey instruments and the
social network analysis (SNA) name-generator approach to measure unique indicators of social interactions
(e.g., in-degree centrality, effective size, structural hole, and outdegree density) and more in-depth patterns of
social interactions. Survey, cognitive assessment, and sociometric data will be used to pursue the proposed
aims. Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, a series of focus groups with residents,
family members, and housing staff will be followed to discuss strategies to translate study findings into
practice. By enhancing the knowledge of the role of cognitive reserves and social interactions in shaping older
immigrants’ cognitive health, this R21 study will respond to the social and cognitive health needs of older
ethnic immigrants in underserved communities and build a ground for network-based interventions for health
promotion."

Exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a common consequence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
where patients experience repeated apneas and hypopneas throughout the night. Accumulating evidence
indicates that CIH can lead to structural and functional changes in the brainstem neurons that control breathing.
Normally, activity of the tongue, innervated by hypoglossal motoneurons, stiffens the airway to keep it open, but
this activity drops dramatically during sleep and contributes causally to OSA in susceptible individuals. During
sleep, reduced hypoglossal motoneuron activity likely results from activation of sleep-specific muscarinic (i.e.
activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) modulation at hypoglossal motoneurons. The specific effects
of muscarinic modulation will depend on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors present, where M1, M3, and M5
muscarinic receptors have canonically excitatory effects whereas the M2 muscarinic receptor subtype has a
canonically inhibitory effect, as well as the compliment of ion channels that are modulated by muscarinic
receptors. This project will explore the hypothesis that CIH leads to significant changes in cholinergic synaptic
inputs to, and cellular properties of, hypoglossal motoneurons resulting in an increased excitatory effect of
muscarinic modulation at hypoglossal motoneurons. This project uses powerful immunofluorescence methods
in combination with in vitro electrophysiology to evaluate neuroanatomical as well as functional changes in
cholinergic signaling at hypoglossal motoneurons in two specific aims. In Aim 1, the project will determine the
expression pattern of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in neonatal and adult mice exposed to chronic
intermittent hypoxia compared to mice naïve to chronic intermittent hypoxia. This aim will also explore changes
in the cholinergic inputs to hypoglossal motoneurons in response to chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure. In
Aim 2, the project will use electrophysiology techniques to test in neonatal and adult mice the functional changes
of muscarinic modulation at hypoglossal motoneurons in response to chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure. This
aim will evaluate these effects both at the network level using the rhythmic slice preparation and also in individual
hypoglossal motoneurons using whole cell electrophysiology methods. These studies will contribute excellent
training opportunities for graduate and professional students, thus providing scientific training to the next
generation of clinicians. Furthermore, the expected outcomes will advance understanding of cellular and
synaptic cholinergic mechanisms that change in response to exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia. This
fundamental information will be essential to develop strategies to explore in vivo the cholinergic mechanisms
that contribute to state-dependent reductions in airway tone and how those mechanisms change in response to
chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure. These data will contribute to the mission of the National Heart Lung, and
Blood Institute of improving the health and quality of Americans suffering from sleep disordered breathing."

 G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways are central to cell-cell
communication and cellular detection of the external environment. Conserved signaling
pathways are used to mediate such diverse processes as hormone signaling, immune function,
and cancer progression in humans and mating in yeast. Negative regulation of these pathways
by Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGS) proteins is critical to maintaining cellular function in
the presence of continuous extracellular signal. The yeast RGS, Sst2, is cytosolic during
vegetative growth when the pheromone pathway is not active. Upon activation of the GPCR,
Ste2, the RGS binds to receptors at the center of polarized growth, but not the edges, and also
to septin structures that form at the base of the mating projection. The mechanisms that
regulate these interactions are not understood. We hypothesize that dynamic control of RGS
subcellular localization serves A) to enhance initial response to pheromone while maintaining
strong desensitization of the pathway later in the response, and B) to provide spatial regulation
of the pathway to enhance yeast mating. We will use live cell imaging, biochemistry, and yeast
genetics approaches to test this hypothesis. In aim 1, we will examine the effect of dynamic
RGS association with the receptor and septins and how these interaction impact sensitivity of
the pathway over time, morphogenesis, polarization, and mating. In aim 2, we will identify the
mechanism by which Sst2 interaction with the receptor and with septins are regulated. Dynamic
control of RGS-Receptor interactions is common in humans, and yeast provides an excellent
system to uncover the impacts this type of signaling motif has on cell physiology."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal, highly heterogeneous malignancy of the blood and bone marrow with
poor prognosis. Along with genetic mutations within the leukemic cells themselves, alterations in the BM
microenvironment (BMM) also play an important role in leukemia transformation, therapy resistance, and
relapse. Thus, to develop effective AML therapies, it is critical to understand how intrinsic genetic alterations in
the leukemic blasts cooperate with the BMM to facilitate leukemogenesis. We identified that the secreted protein
Epithelial Growth Factor Like 7 (EGFL7) is highly expressed in a large cohort of AML patients and is associated
with poor prognosis. We further demonstrate that: 1) EGFL7 protein increases blast cell growth and impacts on
leukemic stem cell (LSC) function; 2) leukemic bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) express and
secrete EGFL7 at increased levels compared to normal MSCs ; 3) normal MSCs exhibit increased growth and
survival in response to a recombinant EGFL7 protein and 4) Egfl7 is increased in AML blasts, but not in pre-
leukemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from a primary Mll PTD; Flt3 ITD murine AML model.
Based on our work, we hypothesize that aberrant EGFL7 expression by leukemic cells and BM niche cells
contribute to leukemogenesis and is a relevant target for treatment for AML patients. The goal of our proposal is
to fully characterize the phenotypic contributions of EGFL7 to myeloid leukemogenesis, dissect its molecular
mechanism(s), and determine the therapeutic benefit of targeting EGFL7 in AML. We are planning to achieve
these goals through the following specific aims (SA): SA#1: To demonstrate the importance of EGFL7 in
leukemic cells to alter the BM microenvironment to promote leukemogenesis. Here, we hypothesize that EGFL7
promotes a positive feedback loop between leukemic cells and the BM microenvironment contributing to disease
initiation and progression. We will test this hypothesis with a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments organized
in three tasks. In Task 1 we will examine the contribution of EGFL7 in the BMM towards the initiation of AML
using our Mll PTD; Flt3 ITD and Egfl7fl/fl conditional knock-out mouse models. For Task 2 we will determine how
alterations in the expression of EGFL7 effects MSCs in leukemogenesis. Task 3 we will characterize the
molecular mechanisms of Egfl7-dependent signaling pathways in MSCs; SA#2: To investigate anti-leukemic
activity of a monoclonal EGFL7 blocking antibody (Parsatuzumab) in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor
(Gilteritinib), using patient derived xenograft (PDX) murine models and primary genetic murine models of AML.
Here, we propose to conduct in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies using AML cell lines, primary AML samples
and two murine models of FLT3 mutated AML to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the autocrine and paracrine
action of EGFL7 in AML. Overall, this proposal seeks to define the role of EGFL7 in the cross-talk between the
BMM and leukemic cells and to generate preclinical data to support clinical development of anti-EGFL7
monoclonal antibodies in combination with FLT3 inhibitors for FLT3 mutated AML."
10974631,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Protein aggregation is associated with both neurodegenerative and systemic diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, and Transthyretin amyloidosis. Highly ordered aggregates known as amyloids
underlie these disease pathologies. Proteins can also undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form
amorphous aggregates that assemble into biomolecular condensates. Proteins within condensates are
dynamic and reversible. However, with age and stress, persistence of proteins within these condensates can
lead to solidification and formation of irreversible aggregates associated with disease. Our LONG-TERM GOAL is
to understand how cells manage protein aggregates. It is well established that molecular chaperones play a
critical role in the disassembly of both condensates and amyloids. However, the field is beginning to unlock the
mechanisms in which chaperones mediate this disassembly. Two different chaperone systems have been
identified to have “disaggregase” activity. Hsp110 is a highly conserved nucleotide exchange factor that binds
with members of the Hsp70 family for disaggregation. The Hsp104 system also binds with the Hsp70 family
chaperones to disassemble and fragment protein aggregates. It has been suggested that these two systems
may work together to increase disaggregation efficiency. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie this
synergy will provide significant leverage into developing therapeutic directions for treating neurodegenerative
and systemic protein aggregation diseases. The OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT is to define how Hsp110 and
Hsp104 systems work together, whether in parallel or in concert, to manage different types of protein
aggregates. Due to strong conservation of chaperone systems across eukaryotic systems, a yeast-based
model provides a tractable system for undergraduate researchers to study molecular mechanisms that underlie
protein disaggregation. The goal of this proposal is to understand how Hsp104 and Hsp110 chaperone
systems manage protein disaggregation using three different protein aggregation systems: A) the study of
biomolecular condensates: stress granules, B) the study of human amyloid: Transthyretin protein, and C) the
study of a yeast-specific amyloid: [PSI+]. This multi-pronged approach provides the ability for controlled
exploration of how these two chaperone systems coordinate their efforts to manage different protein aggregate
substrates. This approach will provide important understanding of how chaperone systems efficiently and
quickly manage protein aggregates, and how they may be exploited for the treatment of protein aggregation
diseases."
10974635,"Project Summary:
The confinement, localization, and nanoscale organization of biomolecules can dramatically alter their
biochemical and physiological properties creating opportunities for in vivo sensing and enhancing
their use as therapeutics. While these principles are relatively well-studied for oligonucleotides, which
are frequently used as vaccines, antisense therapeutics, and theranostics, they are less well-studied
for short biological peptides of similar lengths (10-100s of amino acids). One particularly relevant
class of peptides are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are highly reconfigurable in
response to environmental stimuli, including temperature, pH, ionic strength, and mechanical force.
While fundamental studies have revealed some of these effects on solution peptides, understanding
these properties for IDPs that are confined or organized at the nanoscale is less well understood.
This represents a significant knowledge gap because understanding and controlling the dynamic
properties of IDPs at the nanoscale could enable the creation of stimuli-responsive in vivo pH sensors
while providing insights into the impact of confinement on clinically relevant IDPs regions. The long-
term goal of our work is to develop a comprehensive and forward-looking framework for
understanding, and ultimately designing, the biophysical properties of IDP-nanoparticle architecture.
The objective of this project is to reveal the sequence-, density-, and stimuli-dependence of IDPs
bound to small (~10 nm) spherical nanoparticles, and its ability to influence and control the physical
properties of nanoparticle core. The central hypothesis of this work, based upon previous work on
DNA-nanoparticle conjugates (Ross) and IDP pH sensitivity (Gage), is that localization and
confinement of IDPs onto nanoparticle constructs will influence their structural plasticity to pH,
temperature, and ionic strength. Consequently, IDP-nanoparticle conjugates can generated with
tunable responsivity to their environment, leveraging the biophysical properties of the IDPs and the
physical properties of the inorganic nanoparticle core. The approach for testing our central hypothesis
comprises two specific aims: 1) Reveal the distinct biophysical properties of nanoparticle-bound IDPs
compared to free-in-solution IDPs; and 2) Determine how IDP sequence and density influences
nanoscale optical readouts for sensing ionic strength, temperature, and pH changes. This study is
innovative as it represents one of the first approaches to coupling IDPs to nanoparticles and the
insights gained from this study are necessary to develop a system that is tunable for specific
environmental changes. These studies are a critical first step towards developing new IDP-
nanoparticle sensors that will have a range of biomedical applications."

This work provides fundamental knowledge for the development of wideband acoustic immittance (WAI)
measures as a noninvasive auditory diagnostic tool, where WAI refers to the collection of measurements that
include absorbance, power reflectance, impedance, and related quantities. Potential uses of these measures
include (1) detection of fluid in newborn and young infant ears where tympanometry is less successful and
early diagnosis can be critical to supporting normal speech and language development, (2) identification of the
cause of a conductive hearing loss (e.g., fluid, disarticulated ossicle, fixed ossicle), and (3) monitoring changes
in middle-ear stiffness that result from intracranial pressure changes. The proposed work continues to expand
and update the world’s only online WAI database and corresponding website, which was developed during
the first two cycles of this grant; the database now includes more than 4.9 million rows of WAI data from 9903
subjects and 41 publications that collectively include both normal and diseased ears from subjects of all ages.
This database has provided and will continue to provide additional measurements that the hearing community
can utilize to (1) define features of normative measures for clinical application of WAI measurements, (2)
determine how specific pathologies affect WAI, and (3) train systems that apply machine learning for the
interpretation of WAI measurements. The proposed work expands upon the work in previous grant cycles
to include (1) controlled laboratory-based WAI measurements that will inform criteria for the development of
WAI measurement validity criteria by systematically studying acoustic leaks and probe placements along the
canal and (2) the development of machine-learning models to classify WAI measurements made on normal
and abnormal ears and to ultimately classify specific types of pathologies. A second emphasis of the proposed
work is the research-based education of undergraduate students at Smith College, an all-women’s liberal arts
college. Undergraduate engineering, computer science, statistics, data science, and mathematics students will
be actively involved in all areas of the proposed work, with the goal of encouraging them to continue their
education at the graduate level where they can contribute to health-related research."
10973868,"Cell type specific neural circuits are the foundation of adaptive behaviors and cognitive functions, including
learning, memory, and decision making. Therefore, identifying cell type specific neurocomputational principles
is a primary goal of the BRAIN Initiative and of our research program. A crucial tool in nearly all studies of cell
type specific neural circuits is adeno associated viral (AAV) vectors. To diversify research into neural circuits,
and to expand access to underrepresented groups and more neuroscience labs, we propose to establish the
BRAIN-STORRM (Scientific and Technical Operations for Resource/Reagent Manufacturing) Center at the
HBCU University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES). The BRAIN-STORRM Center at UMES will be a vector
core and validation site that is closely integrated with a major effort at the University of Pittsburgh (UF1MH130881)
to develop cell type specific AAVs. The resulting BRAIN-STORRM Network has three principal goals: (1)
Complement and expand the UF1 work, which is focused on creating and validating enhancer-driven AAVs that
are cell type specific in nonhuman primates, by validating AAV cell type specificity in wild type mice; (2) Test and
validate the effectiveness of cell type specific enhancers in different AAV capsids with various delivery routes,
and thereby build a catalog of ready-to-ship vectors, each with multiple payload options, including GFP,
optogenetic, chemogenetic, and calcium sensor transgenes; and (3) Train a new generation of scientists from
underserved populations in cutting edge molecular biology techniques, with expertise in AAV technology, and
prepare them for academic and biotechnology careers. A web-based inventory will catalog availability and enable
easy ordering, and constructs will be distributed under a modest cost-recovery structure. The BRAIN-STORRM
Center will scale up production, availability, and distribution of cell type specific AAV-enhancer vectors and
provide a vital resource for these high-demand biologicals. Its work validating enhancers in multiple serotypes is
critical science that will expand resource access to labs working in rodents and provide UMES students with the
opportunity to publish high impact papers and launch their careers. These capacity-building efforts will enhance
the impact of BRAIN Initiative funded research and tool development, diversify participation, and increase the
pace, scope, and quality of neuroscientific discovery."
10974596,"ABSTRACT
Autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases affect 10% of the world population, and most conditions have no
cure. Existing treatment options are often broadly acting and have numerous side effects. Autoimmune diseases
often have a preclinical phase where a subset of symptoms occur, but they usually do not yet meet the diagnostic
criteria for the disease stage. Many conditions may also have an early stage where the symptoms are milder.
Early diagnosis at the preclinical phase or early disease stage is challenging as the symptoms are usually non-
speciﬁc. Moreover, only a fraction of individuals will progress to disease stages, which poses challenges for
clinical interventions. Understanding the genetic basis for preclinical immune-mediated diseases and dissecting
risk factors that underlie the progression from preclinical to disease stage is critical. In this application, we
propose to develop a series of methods and software tools to better detect genetic associations with preclinical
to disease stage progressions, perform integrative genomic analysis to identify genetic signatures underlie the
progression, and dissect genetic contribution to sex differences in autoimmune diseases. The methods and tools
will be broadly applicable to a myriad of diseases. The proposed development received enthusiastic support
from researchers studying psoriasis, Sjogren's disease, lupus, vitiligo, etc. The proposed new tools can
profoundly impact the understanding the genetic basis for preclinical diseases."
10974304,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss often have impaired ability to localize audible sound sources, but the
physiological reason for this impairment is unknown. This project involves experiments to test whether rabbits—
a species with a frequency hearing range similar to that of humans—also exhibit hearing-loss-related deficits in
sound localization, and whether hearing loss degrades the transmission of information about sound source
location by neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus—the first brain area along the mammalian
central auditory pathway where information about sound source location converges. Hearing loss will be induced
in anesthetized rabbits via noise overexposure and quantified via changes in auditory brainstem response (ABR)
thresholds and binaural interaction component amplitudes. Rabbits will be trained to perform a behavioral sound
localization task using operant conditioning techniques. Behavioral localization performance will be compared
before and after noise overexposure to determine whether rabbits exhibit a hearing-loss-related deficit similar to
humans. Single-unit data will be collected from the inferior colliculi of a separate cohort of rabbits in response to
acoustic stimuli to measure neuronal sensitivity to sound source location or specific sound localization cues,
including interaural time difference and interaural level difference cues. Neuronal sensitivity to sound source
location or sound localization cues will be compared between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired rabbits to
determine whether noise-induced hearing loss degrades the transmission of information related to sound
localization in the inferior colliculus. Neuronal and behavioral data will be compared to each other using a neural
population decoder of sound-source location to determine whether potential hearing-loss-related deficits in
behavior are consistent with deficits in neural function at the level of the inferior colliculus. Behavioral and neural
experiments in Aim 1 will be performed on rabbits with a mild degree of hearing loss (~25-dB ABR threshold
shifts) that leaves most cochlear hair cells alive, whereas behavioral and neural experiments in Aim 2 will be
performed on rabbits with a moderate degree of hearing loss (~60-dB ABR threshold shifts) that preferentially
kills outer hair cells while leaving most inner hair cells intact. Hair cell counts and counts of synapses between
inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers will be verified at the end of behavioral or neural data collection via
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Together, the two aims will determine whether noise overexposure
alters localization behavior and/or binaural coding in the inferior colliculus of rabbits, and whether such changes
depend upon the survival of outer hair cells."

Kidney failure impacts many, with 750,000 cases annually in the US and 2 million globally. Treatment options include kidney transplant or dialysis. Hemodialysis requires vascular access, often through arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) for improved long-term survival and reduced infection risk when compared to grafts and catheters.
Nevertheless, AVFs frequently mature inadequately, exceeding 50% within 6 months, leading to interventions and complications due to neointimal hyperplasia (NH) and inadequate outward remodeling. Vascular injury results in the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), pathognomonic of NH. Oxidative stress emerges as a pivotal contributor to these downstream processes. Consequently, interventions aimed at mitigating oxidative stress through antioxidant therapies have the potential to enhance AVF maturation, especially since patients with kidney failure have elevated levels of oxidative stress.
Our hypothesis posits that Nrf-2 activation in VSMCs and in an in vivo mouse AVF stenosis model, particularly in uremia, can inhibit VSMC phenotypic changes, and reduce NH while promoting outward remodeling, thus improving AVF maturation. We will investigate this through:
Studying the effect of Nrf2 activation on the phenotype of VSMC 
Assessing a new local therapeutic approach that activates Nrf2 in a mouse AVF stenosis model.
Successful completion of this proposal holds the potential to alleviate clinical morbidity associated with AVF failure, which remains our foremost objective, driven by the pressing needs of our patients."
10974732,"Project Abstract
Significance: It is estimated that ~15% of all cancers are caused by oncogenic virus infections.
Two of the top seven human oncogenic viruses are members of the gammaherpesvirus family:
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). Murine Herpesvirus 68
(MHV-68), a mouse gammaherpesvirus which shares significant homology with KSHV and EBV,
is a model system to study oncogenic gammaherpesvirus infections. This proposal will focus on
the alteration of host cell metabolism by MHV-68 during lytic infection, an often-overlooked aspect
of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle. We will elucidate which host cell metabolism genes are
induced during oncogenic gammaherpesvirus lytic infection and identify clinically relevant anti-
metabolism drugs that can block gammaherpesvirus production. Induction of the lytic cycle allows
the establishment of a lifelong persistent infection by continuously spreading virus within the same
host or to new hosts. The lytic cycle also has implications in seeding new tumors. Understanding
the lytic cycle’s role in altering host cell metabolism can provide us with new therapeutic
mechanisms to block lytic replication and virus spread. Hypothesis: MHV-68 alteration of host
cell metabolism is necessary for lytic replication and blocking these pathways with clinically
relevant anti-metabolism drugs can therapeutically treat gammaherpesvirus infections. Methods:
First, undergraduate researchers will perform RNA-seq analysis of mock vs MHV-68 infected cells
and determine which host cell metabolism genes are induced during infection. Second, students
will identify clinically relevant metabolic inhibitors that can block MHV-68 production in vitro.
Common experimental methods will include drug toxicity assays, which measure cell death and
proliferation, and viral production (titer) assessment using traditional plaque assays. Third,
students will identify which step(s) of the viral life cycle is blocked by these metabolic inhibitors
by using Real-Time RT-PCR to detect perturbations in viral gene transcription throughout the viral
replication cycle. Teaching Aims: The experiments in this proposal will be performed by
undergraduates and have the potential to spark scientific curiosity. This proposal will expose
students to genuine research experiences, help prepare them for graduate school, generate
excitement about the scientific process, and increase our nation’s biomedical workforce.
Implications: This research is transformative by focusing on how alteration of host cell
metabolism during lytic replication of gammaherpesviruses contributes to virion production and
therefore cancer formation. Additionally, inhibition of metabolic pathways with clinically relevant
metabolic inhibitors can potentially be used chemotherapeutically to treat viral induced tumors."
10974733,"Summary
During blood development, most stem cells are quiescent, enter the cell cycle infrequently to amplify as short-term
hematopoietic stem cells and lineage-restricted progenitors and then exit the cell cycle in order to permanently
differentiate into mature and functional cell types. Cell cycle exit is relevant to cancer since leukemic stem cells
(LSCs) undergo a similar process of expansion and exit during tumorigenesis. This project seeks to uncover
the mechanisms by which cell cycle exit is achieved during terminal myeloid differentiation. While transcription
factors (TFs) that specify myeloid cell identity, PU.1 and C/EBPα/β/δ, are known to inhibit the cell cycle, whether
they directly regulate the expression of canonical cell cycle genes acting at the G1/S transition is not known.
This project will investigate the hypothesis that PU.1 and C/EBP-family TFs bind to distal enhancers of cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CDKIs) and Cyclin D2 to upregulate or downregulate them respectively in a
cell-identity speciﬁc manner. Aim 1 will test whether the identiﬁed CDKIs and Ccnd2 cause cell cycle exit in an
in vitro model of myeloid differentiation. Gain of function experiments for the CDKIs Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, Cdkn2c,
and Cdkn2d and loss of function experiments for Ccnd2 will be performed and the proportion of cells exiting the
cell cycle will be measured. How genome-wide gene expression and DNA accessibility changes with cell cycle
will be determined by synchronizing cells and performing RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq time course experiments.
Cells that have exited during differentiation will be isolated using dye dilution techniques and their transcriptome
and DNA accessibility will be compared to those of cycling cells to uncover new candidates for mediating cell
cycle exit. Aim 2 is to determine how cell cycle genes are regulated by PU.1- and C/EBP-bound enhancers
at the resolution of TF binding sites. A set of enhancers of the CDKIs and Ccnd2 has been identiﬁed using
high-resolution DNA accessibility proﬁling (ATAC-Seq). The occupancy of PU.1 and C/EBP-family TFs at their
binding-sites in these enhancers will be conﬁrmed using CUT&RUN. Putative enhancers will be tested using
reporter genes integrated in a site-speciﬁc manner with CRISPR/Cas9 into the ROSA26 locus. Predicted binding
sites will be validated using site-directed mutagenesis of the reporter locus. Whether PU.1 and/or C/EBP-family
TFs binding to the candidate enhancers regulate their endogenous targets and cell cycle exit will be checked by
mutating the validated binding sites in the endogenous locus with CRISPR/Cas9 homology directed repair (HDR)."
10974658,"An important theme in system neuroscience is to understand the fundamental principle by which brain cells
work together to give rise to behaviors. Neuroscience experiments often require in vivo neural recordings at
optimized speed, as neural computations occur on short timescales and are distributed over large tissue
volumes. Optical imaging in awake animals, expressing genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or chemical
indicators, has become an essential tool in neuroscience. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest to
develop imaging tools that can record large-scale volumetric neural activity in behaving animals. Of particular
interest is to investigate the functional dynamics of astrocytes. Accumulating evidence has shown that
astrocytes, the most numerous glial cells, have active roles in many neurological diseases and
neuropsychiatric disorders. The patterns of astrocytic activity and their relationships with behaviors in health
and disease conditions remain largely unclear. In particular, astrocyte imaging in the brain of freely behaving
animals has not yet been explored, due to the lack of miniaturized high-speed volumetric imaging system.
Recent progress in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has shed light on this topic. At present,
however, LSFMs are not suitable for high-speed volumetric imaging in freely behaving animals due to several
key limitations, including physical constraints of LSFM instruments, and light scattering and absorption in deep
tissue. The goal of this proposal is to address these technical barriers and transform LSFM into a novel
imaging tool for astrocyte imaging in freely behaving animals. To achieve our research goal, our vision sets
forth a transformative machine learning-augmented miniature adaptive optics light-sheet microscopy platform,
named as miniature Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy with following underlying ideas. First, we will
leverage a fiber bundle-coupled system design to address the physical constraints of LSFM in order to image
in freely behaving mice. We will engineer a miniature planar illumination scan head and use a coherent fiber
bundle to couple the scan head to the main optical system, which will be integrated into a compact form so that
it can be carried by a motorized rotatory stage to accommodate animal’s movement. Second, we will develop a
hybrid adaptive optics (AO) - deep learning approach to enhance the imaging performance in the deep tissue.
The AO module will be built on recent progress on direct wavefront sensing using an extended-source
wavefront sensor, while Monte Carlo based tissue optics model will be built with detailed neuroanatomy
information in order to generate realistic simulated image dataset for deep learning-based image processing.
Finally, we will consider widely-used experiments in neuroscience field to validate our system performance to
ensure that our system will be easily adopted by the neuroscience community."

The practical contribution of computational mathematics to ultrasound-based biomedical applications hinges on
the efficiency and accuracy of algorithms to simulate the propagation of waves in models of biological media.
Such algorithms lie at two extremes: oversimplified closed-form methods and overdone full-waveform
computational simulations based on differential equations. The former methods (such as constant-speed wave
migration) are very fast, but their stringent assumptions are inaccurate for realistic biological media. The latter
methods (such as finite differences/elements) are accurate but unnecessarily complex, requiring super-
computing resources to run. We propose a novel implementation of pseudo-differential algorithms to bridge these
two extremes. This approach strikes a valuable balance between accuracy and complexity, thus resolving the
bottleneck caused by the inefficiency of full-waveform simulations.
Upon implementation of the proposed methods, the optimization of the insonation profile and/or inversion of
measurements could be fully automated, be deployed in real-time, and fit into the clinical/surgical workflow. Such
a development would drastically expand the use of ultrasound in the clinical arena where there is a great need
to monitor perfusion of organs to avoid ischemic injury and real-time assessment of therapeutic procedures.
Overall, our goal is to implement a novel, unexploited set of mathematical and computational tools to improve
the speed and automation of ultrasound simulations to enhance ultrasound-based technologies in clinical
environments with limited computational resources.
Under the mentorship of the PIs, teams of undergraduate students at University of Texas at Tyler will participate
in the research study. This project provides an effective training ground for them to apply their education, and to
experience what it is like to be a professional engineer working in an interdisciplinary team. The students will be
exposed to state-of-the-art research on computational mathematics for biomedical imaging (integral geometry,
differential equations, signal processing, and computer programming). In addition to part-time employment
during 21 weeks of school semesters at University of Texas at Tyler, the students will work as summer interns
at the Predictive Analytics Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. This
internship program offers nine paid weeks focused on the proposed research project, attendance in research
and professional development seminars designed for undergraduates, career development workshops, and
designated housing near the workplace. These integrated practical activities will empower the students and offer
them opportunities to understand the impact of engineering on healthcare technologies."
10974747,"Project Summary/Abstract
Children diagnosed with speech sound disorder (SSD) demonstrate atypical speech patterns that impact speech
intelligibility, creating obstacles to their engagement in both social and academic environments [1]. Delayed
speech development typically resolves by the age of 8-9; however, approximately 2-5% of individuals exhibit
residual speech sound disorder (RSSD), which can persist into adolescence or adulthood despite years of
intervention. RSSD primarily affects late-developing sounds such as the American English rhotic /ɹ/ and sibilants
/s/. Previous research, including our work in the past funding cycle, indicates that children with RSSD typically
exhibit reduced auditory-perceptual acuity for the sounds they produce in error. This implies that interventions
designed to enhance auditory targets and provide feedback on error sounds could improve treatment outcomes
for RSSD. One such intervention is biofeedback, in which learners view a real-time display of the acoustic signal
of their speech compared to a target representing the desired output. Biofeedback has shown promising results
in individuals with RSSD who have not responded to previous treatments [2, 3]. Another well-studied approach
seeks to enhance the auditory target for error sounds by presenting a wide range of productions and training the
child to classify them as correct or incorrect [4-6]. The present proposal is centered on exploring the relationship
between these two auditory-enhanced treatment methods for American English /ɹ/ while also extending the use
of biofeedback to another frequently misarticulated sound category, the sibilants.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to expand our basic understanding of perception-production relations
in child speech while evaluating whether tasks involving perceptual training and visual-acoustic biofeedback are
valid in the online modality. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the extent to which a period of perceptual training can
enhance response to biofeedback treatment via telepractice. Aim 2 will use a single-case experimental design
to test the hypothesis that biofeedback treatment via telepractice can be successfully expanded to include the
sibilant /s/, a common target for children with RSSD that presents novel technological challenges for remote
service delivery. Our central hypothesis is that gains associated with biofeedback treatment will be enhanced
when perception training precedes production training and that biofeedback intervention for sibilants will yield
statistically and clinically significant treatment effects in the telepractice context.
 This research will continue to advance the evidence base by contributing the first studies investigating the
efficacy of integrated auditory-perceptual training and biofeedback treatment in the telepractice context. This
research is also pioneering as it represents the first systematic effort to measure the efficacy of biofeedback
using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrum to display sibilant sounds. Overall, the proposed research is
optimally positioned to make a high-impact contribution as new technologies reshape the nature of scientific
research and treatment delivery in speech pathology."

Two rare types of thyroid cancer currently have extremely poor outcomes. Radioiodine-refractory (RAIR),
recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is incurable and has a 10-year survival of
~10%. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a highly aggressive, dedifferentiated thyroid cancer with a median
survival of <6 months from the time of diagnosis. Both tumors are driven by mutually exclusive genetic
alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Targeted therapies against BRAFV600E and
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) rearrangements (RET, NTRK, or ALK) have revolutionized outcomes for these
genomic subsets of RAIR DTC and ATC. However, developing therapies for RAS, NF1, and non-V600 BRAF
mutations, which activate MAPK signaling through RAF dimers (“dimer-driven”), has been significantly more
challenging. Avutometinib is a next-generation MEK 1/2 inhibitor that inhibits both MEK and RAF to overcome
the rebound pathway stimulation that limits the activity of other MEK inhibitors against dimer-driven disease.
This has translated to promising clinical activity with avutometinib against RAS-mutant tumors.
Nonetheless, on-treatment biopsies from patients have revealed that avutometinib treatment increases focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation/activation, which has been well established to mediate intrinsic
resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition in several tumor types. Subsequent randomized data has confirmed
avutometinib plus the FAK inhibitor defactinib produces superior clinical efficacy compared to avutometinib
alone in patients with low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, including RAS-mutant tumors.
These data, along with evidence from our studies of patient tumors and genetically engineered mouse models
of advanced thyroid cancer, serve as the clinical and biologic basis for our phase II trial of avutometinib plus
defactinib in dimer-driven thyroid cancers. To expeditiously identify promising clinical signals, we have
developed an innovative basket trial design which will allow us to evaluate in both dimer-driven RAIR DTCs
and ATCs the contribution of 3 putative, non-exclusive mechanisms to avutometinib + defactinib efficacy:
tumor cell-autonomous antitumor effects, redifferentiation of tumors to restore and/or enhance RAI sensitivity,
and modulation of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). In Aim 1, we will evaluate overall response
(primary) as well as progression-free survival and redifferentiation rates/efficacy (secondary). In Aim 2, we will
interrogate in pre- and on-treatment biopsies the impact of avutometinib + defactinib upon MAPK- and FAK-
regulated signaling and analyze how it relates to clinical response and redifferentiation. In Aim 3, we will
analyze how combined MAPK and FAK pathway inhibition modulates the immune TME, specifically testing the
hypothesis that inhibiting these signals will deplete immune-repressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
in dimer-driven ATCs. This trial will identify the optimal application(s) for this novel combination in patients with
advanced thyroid cancers to inform future drug development efforts."
10974359,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Advances in genetics and genomics have raised hopes for the development of gene-based treatments for
inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) which are single-gene defects that cause vision loss. Some of the greatest
successes for gene-based treatments has occurred in the most severe subset of IRDs that fall into the rubric of
Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) with vision loss often occurring congenitally. LCA success stories from
human clinical trials include those caused by deleterious variants in the genes RPE65, LRAT, CEP290,
GUCY2D, and AIPL1. Although these disorders present with severe vision loss in early childhood, the great
majority of trials have not included young pediatric patients, where efficacy measures are very challenging. Our
overarching long-term goal is to evaluate treatments for congenital blinding conditions in younger pediatric
patients who stand to gain the most before the window of cortical plasticity closes. Recently we initiated gene
augmentation therapy for adults with LCA5, which is a retinal ciliopathy resulting in particularly severe early
onset vision loss. Improving vision for the adult population with LCA5 would immensely impact quality of life.
Initial results in this adult trial using an AAV8 vector with a subretinal injection appear very promising with
evidence of safety and efficacy. We propose to perform a clinical trial of LCA5 gene augmentation therapy in
the older pediatric population (i.e. adolescents) and prepare for future clinical trials by developing novel
outcome measures in, and for, the very young pediatric population. We will leverage the existing IND,
regulatory support, and OPGx-001 clinical vector provided by our industry partner (Opus Genetics), to
accomplish two Aims. Aim 1: Perform a clinical trial of OPGx-001 for LCA5 in pediatric patients aged 13 to 18
years. Re-defined outcome measures (including the addition of innovative measures tested in a `seamless'
clinical trial design) will be used to determine the safety and efficacy of uniocular subretinal gene delivery of
OPGx-001 in a Phase I/II dose escalation (1.0x1010, 3.0x1010 and 1.0x1011 vg/eye) clinical trial. Three eligible
patients ages >13 to 18 will enter each dose group and will be followed for 3 years as an extension of the
current gene therapy trial in the adult population. Aim 2: Develop novel ocular outcome measures for pediatric
patients aged >1 to ≤13 years with LCA5 and other forms of LCA for future interventional trials. We will develop
subjective and objective measures of vision, and validate their performance in patients ages ≥8 before
deploying them in a younger (<8) group of patients with LCA that are the target population in this and future
trials. At completion, the project will provide safety and efficacy data for OPGx-001 in adolescent patients, and
a specific path for treating very young patients with vision loss due to LCA5 or other gene defects."
10818541,"Advancing age is tightly linked to the increasing global incidence of skeletal diseases. Osteoporosis poses a major public health threat for over 54 million Americans as it is interrelated with high fracture rates. Osteoporosis related hip fractures are invariably associated with significant morbidity and strikingly, a 58% mortality rate in the elderly within the first year of injury. This problem is compounded by a lack of efficient preventive and medical therapies for age-related bone disease free of major side effects. Recent studies have revealed adult stem cell populations within bone that could be potentially targeted as a regenerative source to maintain and restore skeletal health. However, breakthroughs in stem cell based-regenerative strategies have been hampered by the inability to isolate bona fide stem cell populations. Our group has helped delineate highly purified skeletal stem cell (SSC) lineages crucial for maintaining normal bone homeostasis and regeneration following injury. My latest results suggest that aging shifts lineage determination of stem cells triggering altered niche dynamics thereby contributing to a decline of regenerative capacity and providing a rationale that skeletal aging is caused by SSC dysfunction. The initial findings of this proposal provide evidence for the existence of multiple SSC subtypes (SSC diversity) present in limb long bones. Transcriptomic analysis at the single-cell level shows that SSCs undergo aging-induced molecular and compositional changes coinciding with functional heterogeneity. I have identified Wnt1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 2 (Wisp2) that is specifically upregulated in the aged SSC lineage. Wisp2 significantly impairs bone formation when applied to SSC in vitro or fractures of young mice in vivo. Aim1 has determined the role of age-related changes in SSC diversity including the relative proportion of SSC subtypes and their functional heterogeneity to skeletal integrity and will now be completed with spatiotemporal single cell analysis to define anatomical changes of SSCs and their niche cell interactions. In Aim2, I will examine the mechanism of stem cell-based skeletal aging through Wisp2, which I hypothesize, may regulate SSC diversity and heterogeneity. Proposed experiments will also address the age-dependent role of stem cell based epigenetic drift and a potential connection to new concepts of stem cell aging such as adverse clonal skeletogenesis. Importantly, I will determine the unexplored identity of the Wisp2 receptor in SSCs by highly sensitive proximity-dependent labeling to identify targetable pathways involved in SSC-mediated skeletal aging. The guidance and research environment provided by my new host institution for my independent research phase is cutting-edge and highly relevant to the purpose of this proposal allowing implementation of the latest transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic methods, including single-cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, RNAScope, NanoString single cell imaging and TurboID, to interrogate the proposed aims. These studies will establish a new paradigm for understanding skeletal disease from the perspective of SSC diversity and should facilitate the development of new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches to tackle skeletal disorders."

 Bacterial infections cause a tremendous burden to human health, and our first line of defense – amphiphilic
disinfectants and antiseptics – rely on century-old technology and are now susceptible to bacterial resistance.
This research program has worked for over a decade to develop novel disinfectants, broadly expanding
beyond the dogmatic reliance on single-cation amphiphiles like benzalkonium chloride. We aim to capitalize
on recent insights, and forge innovations as yet unseen by bacteria. Specifically, we will continue to explore
phosphorus-based analogues to traditional disinfectants (quaternary phosphonium compounds or QPCs);
work to improve atom economy and mitigate toxicity via innovative structure design; endeavor to better
understand how a cationic center (whatever the element) influences bioactivity; and finally broaden our
understanding of structure-activity relationships, anchored by specific knowledge of charge density and
solution behaviors.
 While our group has prepared roughly 840 novel disinfectant compounds to date, of first priority will be the
construction of an even wider variety of amphiphilic structures. This will take advantage of our recent
discoveries in multicationic QPC structure classes, which show the ability to eradicate bacterial strains that
have otherwise been deemed pan-resistant. Compounds with bushy-tails – species bearing multiple mid-
length alkyl chains – as well as chimeric phosphonium/ammonium hybrids and less-explored
bolaamphiphilic structures will be pursued to broaden out structure-activity relationship understanding.
 We also aim to better understand how the electronic nature of our cationic atom (P vs N) in our
amphiphiles can correlate to, and ultimately predict, bioactivity. Charge density analyses (aided by x-ray
structure analysis in the lab of Michael Zdilla at Temple University) and Hammett-style electron density-
vs-bioactivity plots will enhance our fundamental understanding of how cationic character influences
antimicrobial activity and resistance susceptibility. Dynamic surface tension behavior data will be correlated
to time-kill observations to further expand the utility of these disinfectants.
 At the forefront of this research program is the work of undergraduate collaborators, who have been
the drivers of our 36 publications in this field, and serve as first authors on 10 of our papers. We envision
continuing to employ straightforward chemical syntheses, based on hypothesis-driven rationales. The result is
twofold: we are able to learn a great deal about the antibacterial activity of QPC and QAC scaffolds with
evaluations of individual structural motifs in a very short period of time, and our students are able to
experience interdisciplinary science, as part of a collaborative, multidisciplinary team to advance our
knowledge."
10974663,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents one of the biggest global health problems of the 21st century. Defined by the
presence of hyperglycemia without another attributable cause, T2D is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion and
thus both clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Several efforts have been made to identify T2D subtypes
using a variety of clustering approaches based on either clinical or genetic factors.
Current T2D classification approaches have limitations, preventing their implementation into patient care. T2D
subtypes based on clinical variables currently rely on measuring these traits at the time of diagnosis, which is
not practical for standard clinical care, as these measures may change over time and in relationship to medication
use. Genetic-based subtyping approaches have the advantage that they do not change over time but also do
not capture the present metabolic state of the individual. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a universal
and standardized T2D subtype classification to improve understanding of disease and provide a path forward for
applying personalized medicine to people with T2D.
To develop new T2D subtypes and understand their clinical utility, we have assembled a large and diverse
collection of cohorts with phenotypic and multi-omic data, including some of the largest T2D clinical trials in the
United States. These studies include Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness
Study (GRADE), Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes), Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in
Adolescents and Youth (TODAY), and the Diabetes Prevention Program. Additionally, we have assembled
multiple large, diverse cohorts and biobanks with longitudinal data, including Search for Diabetes in Youth
(SEARCH), All of Us, Mass General Brigham, and Kaiser Permanente.
In Aim 1, we will use state of the art machine-learning clustering approaches to integrate multiple data types,
including clinical variables, genetics and metabolomics, to define new T2D subtypes and uncover disease
mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the clinical relevance of existing and newly developed T2D subtypes
using data from clinical trials involving glucose-lowering medications and lifestyle interventions, while considering
ancestry, environmental factors and social determinants of health. In Aim 3, we will develop simplified versions
of the diabetes subtypes to assess the clinical utility of these subtypes in a “real world” setting.
This proposal will provide a unified and standard classification of T2D and identify subgroups of patients more
likely to respond to particular T2D medications and/or develop disease complications, providing a path forward
for precision medicine for all."
10974305,"Project Summary
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder. However, we lack neurobiological models and
interventions to explain and treat the core characteristics of food restriction, feeling fat, and body size
overestimation. While research has made progress in understanding brain function involved in AN
pathophysiology, translating those results into biological therapies has been challenging. Studies have
suggested that metabolic factors contribute to developing and maintaining AN pathophysiology. Specifically,
brain glucose utilization and metabolism may be altered in AN, interfere with brain energy homeostasis, and
contribute to illness development and maintenance. A small study indicated that ketosis might be
therapeutic for AN core behaviors such as eating and shape concerns. In this application, we will study
individuals weight recovered from AN, establish biological targets as diet-related metabolic markers for AN
(R61 phase), and replicate and link those targets to AN-specific behaviors (R33 phase). The weight-
recovered AN group will also be compared with a healthy control sample. The R61 Phase Specific Aim of
the project is to establish target engagement for a therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) in AN after weight
recovery and establish safety and tolerability. We hypothesize that TKD will be associated with reduced
brain glucose metabolism using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and positron emission tomography
(PET) (target engagement). Higher blood ketosis levels will be associated with a more significant reduction
of the brain [18F]FDG glucose metabolism rate (dose dependency). We hypothesize that TKD will be well
tolerated, that participants will remain within the normal weight range (tolerability), and that study
participants will be able to adhere to TKD as indicated by regular blood ketosis measurements (treatment
fidelity). There will be an initial indication that TKD and associated biological measures correlate with
behavioral measures derived from eating disorder-specific assessments. The go/no-go criterion for the
transition from the R61 to the R33 phase is determined by a significant change in [18F]FDG metabolism rate
between before and after TKD in the frontal cortex (target engagement). The R33 Phase Specific Aim is to
replicate target engagement in a larger weight-recovered AN cohort and associate brain response with AN-
specific behaviors (functional outcome). Similarly to the R61 Specific Aims, we hypothesize that TKD will
decrease brain [18F]FDG metabolism in the larger cohort (target engagement replication). The level of
ketosis and magnitude of [18F]FDG uptake decrease will be associated with decreased eating restraint,
eating and weight concerns, and clinical impairment based on clinical assessments (functional outcome)."
10974448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the existence of guidelines from the World Health Organization and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommending an optimal interpregnancy interval (IPI) of at least 18 to 24
months, nearly one-third of non-first births in the US are conceived within 18 months of the end of a preceding
pregnancy. Short IPI is a significant problem due to the associated adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most
of which are concentrated in vulnerable populations, including immigrants. Specifically, African immigrants have
1.5 to 3 times higher risk of IPI of less than six months compared to US-born Black and US-born white people,
respectively. Despite the rapid growth in African immigration to the US in recent years, the population is
underrepresented in reproductive health research and programs. Hence, the risk factors for short IPI are not well
understood. Studies in sub-Saharan Africa suggest that social and cultural norms about reproductive health and
abortion, infant mortality, and social support influence fertility and contraceptive behaviors and practices.
However, it is unknown if these norms and practices persist through after immigration and integration, and
whether they play a role in short IPIs in the African immigrant population. The purpose of this R15 proposal is to
use an exploratory sequential mixed methods design to understand the social and cultural norms and
demographic factors related to short IPI in African immigrants living in the US. The specific aims are: 1) to
describe, using qualitative methods, social and cultural norms about optimal birth spacing, including how cultural
beliefs and practices related to fertility and family planning, intimate relationship factors, and stigma shape these
norms among African immigrant women and men; and 2) to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties
of a culturally-sensitive measure of underlying sociocultural constructs related to birth spacing and IPI, using
quantitative methods. We propose to conduct in-depth interviews with women aged 18-49 years and men aged
18-60 years, born in Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone, living in Greater Philadelphia, home to one of the
most distinct African immigrant communities in the US. A quantitative measure will be developed from a)
qualitative findings from in-depth interviews and b) a scoping review of existing sociocultural norms measures
with relevance to IPI that may be modified. This measure will be refined and validated with a sample of African-
born women of reproductive age. The research team for this project has a strong background and relevant
experience in conducting community-engaged research in reproductive health, interpregnancy intervals,
contraceptive use, immigrant research in development and humanitarian contexts, and measurement
development and validation. The long-term goals of this study are to 1) develop culturally acceptable and
clinically relevant interventions to optimize IPI in African immigrants; 2) enrich the research environment at
Arcadia University; and 3) enhance career development opportunities for students through mentoring in
research."

Cushing Disease (CD) a life-threatening “orphan disease” with an annual US incidence of ~8 cases per million.
It is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma, which drives excess
adrenal-derived cortisol production. The annual health care cost of CD patients is > 7 times higher than
average patients, and there is a large unmet medical need in treatment for this “orphan disease”. In a
systematic high throughput screen of 200,000 compounds, we identified the dual PI3K + HDAC inhibitor,
fimepinostat (CUDC-907) as an incredibly potent inhibitor of murine and human corticotroph tumor POMC
transcription and ACTH secretion in both in vitro and in vivo models of CD. Supported by our pre-clinical data,
we hypothesize that Fimepinostat suppresses pituitary corticotroph tumor growth and ACTH production to
normalize cortisol levels in patients with CD. We now propose a pilot, short-term (4 weeks) phase II single-
center study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Fimepinostat in the treatment of patients with de novo,
persistent, and/or recurrent CD recruited at the University of California, Los Angeles. This Phase 2 open-label
adaptive study has 2 specific aims: Aim 1 will assess the efficacy and Aim 2 the safety respectively of
Fimepinostat in 20 subjects with de novo, persistent, or recurrent CD from UCLA outpatient clinics. Subjects
will be randomized to either Fimepinostat 60mg (two 30mg capsules once a day, 10 subjects) or 30mg (single
30mg capsule daily in 10 subjects). Fimepinostat will be administered days 3-7 of each week and then 2 days
off for a total of 4 weeks. Drug efficacy in both treatment arms will be determined based on the response rate
of subjects exhibiting normalization and/or >50% reduction of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (24h UFC) levels
(mean of 3 consecutive samples) after treating 10 subjects in each treatment dose arm. As further efficacy
assessment, we will compare several secondary endpoints including normalization of 24h UFC (days 23-28
inclusive), plasma ACTH, serum and salivary cortisol levels (D29) to the subject’s baseline levels (Days -1 to -
5). Changes in clinical signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism, including reductions in body weight, body
mass index, and blood pressure along with changes in health-related QOL and depression scores from
baseline to 4 weeks will also be assessed although we acknowledge that some of these parameters may take
longer to change than our 4 week study. A DSMB will carefully monitor all aspects of safety and assess any
adverse and/or serious adverse events. This study will determine the most effective and least toxic dose
regimen of Fimepinostat in the treatment of CD and pave the way for larger longer-term clinical trials in
Cushing disease."

E-cadherin is the primary mediator of strong cell-cell adhesion between epithelial cells and plays an
essential role in the morphogenesis and maintenance of epithelial tissues. E-cadherin is also a known
mechanosensor that actively responds to the levels of inter-cellular forces and resides in a
microenvironment formed by adjoining epithelial cells. The long-term goal of the project is to understand
how the mechanical regulation of E-cadherin adhesion leads to a cohesive yet dynamic multi-cellular
architecture in epithelial tissues. The goal of the proposed project is to delineate the mechanism by which
forces are transmitted via E-cadherin adhesions and to uncover how epithelial cells sense cell-like stiffness
laterally via E-cadherin adhesions. The E-cadherin-β-catenin-α-catenin complex directly and indirectly
couples to actin to transmit cell-generated forces. Firstly, while the α-catenin-vinculin link, which plays a role
in force sensing is thought to be the primary force transmission pathway, we recently found that,
surprisingly, α-catenin is not essential for force transmission. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that the
less studied β-catenin-vinculin link is an alternate significant mechanism of force transmission at E-cadherin
adhesions. We will test this by using mutant versions of vinculin and α-catenin deficient in binding β-catenin
and vinculin, respectively, and corresponding knockout cell lines. We will use traction force microscopy with
E-cadherin-coated soft substrates to avoid the confounding factor of vinculin’s mechanical role in cell-matrix
contacts. We will also use magnetic pulling cytometry with E-cadherin-coated beads and biaxial stretching
of cell islands to assess the adhesion strength at multiple scales. Secondly, while E-cadherin has been
shown to sense the stiffness of E-cadherin-coated soft substrates, it is still unclear if epithelial cells sense
cell-like stiffness laterally via E-cadherin adhesions. To test this, we will devise a biomimetic model of E-
cadherin in a physiologically relevant geometry, in which cells interface laterally with an E-cadherin-coated,
stiffness tunable, soft surface. We will test the hypothesis that lateral sensing of cell-like stiffness modulates
E-cadherin density, cell dynamics, Rho and YAP levels. We will also test whether this lateral stiffness
sensing is dependent on the α-catenin-vinculin mechanotransduction axis. We will use biomimetic soft
substrate fabrication, mutant version of α-catenin deficient in binding vinculin in α-catenin knockout cells,
sensors/indicators of Rho and YAP, and perform live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence to accomplish
this. Knowledge gained on cell-to-cell force transmission and epithelial cell sensing of neighboring cell
mechanical properties will be crucial in understanding the context-dependent biophysical control of E-
cadherin adhesion. This will be essential to better understand the functional basis of the role of E-cadherin
in mediating epithelial tissue integrity, mechanical coherence and its dysregulation in disease states like
cancer."
10974132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Because this project addresses the mechanisms that contribute to Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), a
highly prevalent communication disorder in the United States, it is directly relevant to the mission of NIDCD.
Ultimately, the outcomes may offer solutions to three significant problems: how to identify DLD regardless of
language(s) spoken, how to identify DLD in adults, and how to distinguish DLD from other related conditions.
Our overarching hypothesis is that a deficit in short-term verbal memory (stVM) is endophenotypic of DLD. Our
current objectives are to 1) delineate the role of linguistic long-term memory, attention, and their interface in the
stVM deficit and 2) demonstrate the cascading effects of the stVM deficit on the integrity of the language system.
Aim 1: To determine the contribution of structure and meaning in linguistic long-term memory to the stVM deficit.
We will manipulate prosodic structure and word meaning during nonword repetition (NWR) (1a) and grammatical
structure during real phrase repetition (1b) and use linear mixed-effects models to test the hypothesis that
individuals with DLD can use linguistic long-term memory to support stVM, but they benefit more from meaning
than structure. 1b also offers a chance to explore the nature of stVM per se, specifically, to observe the children’s
rehearsal strategies.
Aim 2: To determine the contribution of attention to the stVM deficit. We will manipulate the burden on attention
during encoding by pairing a visual search task with the NWR of sequences with high or low phonotactic
probability and use linear mixed-effects models to test the hypothesis that the stVM deficit reflects difficulties in
attentional control during encoding. This experiment also offers an additional test of the contribution of linguistic
long-term memory to stVM function.
Aim 3: To determine the relationship between sustained attention, stVM, and linguistic long-term memory. We
will conduct two tests of each construct and use principal component analysis and multiple regression to test the
hypothesis that language moderates the relationship between sustained attention and stVM.
Aim 4: To simulate the cascading effect of the stVM deficits. To test the stVM deficit as an endophenotype, we
will provide higher and lower support for novel word form encoding in children with typical language development
and observe the subsequent influence on two aspects of the system, semantic category knowledge and sentence
comprehension. We will use linear mixed-effects models to test the hypothesis that the stVM deficit has
downstream consequences for the integrity of the overall language system."

This project will investigate spatio-temporal delivery of FLASH radiation using pencil beam scanning technology.
Modern Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) technology can deliver spatially non-uniform (Gaussian-like) pencil beam
in very high instantaneous dose rate to both shallow and deep-seated tumors; however, the low dose tail of a
pencil beam and the relatively slow volume scanning speed for large targets generate a variable dose rate at
selected target or normal tissue locations. The impact of this spatial-temporal variation is still unknown for
FLASH. Even at the same (averaged) dose rate, degeneracy exists that the FLASH treatment can be delivered
by different time-dose sequences. There is a need to study the timing structure of dose delivery in the context of
FLASH treatment, as well as measuring and documenting each FLASH treatment so that the outcome can be
better understood. Our central hypothesis is that proton PBS can be optimized to deliver FLASH enhanced
radiotherapy with existing accelerator technology. The aims of the proposal are:
Aim 1 - Investigation of spatio-temporal variations and SOBP versus shoot through PBS beams.
Aim 2 - Development of a spatial-temporal biological effective dose model for PBS-based FLASH
proton therapy.
Aim 3 - Development of fast dose recording instrumentation, image guided positional systems, quality
assurance procedures, and end-to-end validation.
Success of this project will demonstrate the ability to deliver FLASH to large treatment volumes using proton
PBS for the first time. Combined with the ability of proton therapy to accurately deliver dose to deep targets,
this will allow translation of PBS FLASH proton therapy to early stage clinical trial studies."

Objective: The proposed study explores mediators and moderators of discrimination’s damaging effects on
sleep. Background: Millions of Americans have sleep problems that undermine health, social and work
functioning, and ultimately cost billions annually. Hence, understanding factors that hinder sleep is critical for
personal and societal health. One factor hindering sleep is discrimination. Racial discrimination increases
arousal, which disrupts sleep and contributes to health disparities between Black and White Americans.
Significance: Although discrimination and sleep problems are consistently linked, little is known about the
processes underlying this relation. Risk factors that lead to greater discrimination and consequently poorer
sleep are also unclear. Innovation: Prior studies linking discrimination and sleep have not considered
socioemotional processes, moderating conditions, and typically use cross-sectional self-report methods. By
integrating daily, in vivo ecological momentary assessments of discrimination and emotion invalidation with
objective sleep measures (i.e., actigraphy), the current work identifies processes underlying the crisis in race-
based sleep disparities. Specific Aims: With a Black American sample, the proposal tests whether
discrimination triggers emotion invalidation, termed social pain minimization (SPM), which negatively affects
sleep and whether these effects are largest for individuals that strongly active Black racial stereotypes in others
(i.e., Black racial phenotypicality; BRP). Expected Results: Within-participant experiences with discrimination
are predicted to increase SPM and sleep problems. SPM is hypothesized to partially mediate the effect of
discrimination on sleep. Finally, participants higher in BRP are expected to experience more discrimination and
consequently worse sleep than those lower in BRP. SPM is predicted to more strongly mediate discrimination’s
effect on sleep for those high (v. low) in BRP. Future Directions: The proposed work identifies intervening
processes and risk factors for the discrimination—sleep relation, these relations can then be targeted by future
interventions geared at fostering emotion validation to mitigate SPM’s corrosive effect on sleep."
10974525,"Abstract:
Tularemia is a fatal human disease caused by the Gram-negative intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis
(Ft). Francisella species are prevalent in the northern hemisphere, and in the past decade, an increasing
incidence of tularemia has been reported in the mid-western states of the USA. Due to its potential to cause
severe illness and death, Ft has been used in the biological weapon programs of several countries and is now
classified by the CDC as a Tier 1 category A select agent. However, the factors responsible for the extreme
virulence of Francisella and the host immune responses required to combat Ft infection are not well understood.
From the host’s perspective, toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) outside the host cell, while Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are essential for detecting bacterial and
host products in the cytoplasm. The NLRs assemble into a multi-protein complex known as the inflammasome
in response to the recognition of pathogen and host-derived ligands. The inflammasome-dependent host-
defense mechanisms include the production of bioactive pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of cell death.
This proposal builds on our previous research to further investigate the mechanisms underlying repression of
the Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes during Ft infection. One question that remained unanswered is why both
Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes are repressed in Ft-infected macrophages. This indicates that a common
mechanism may be linked to the repression of both Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes. Our hypothesis is that Ft-
induced mitophagy, a process that removes stressed/dysfunctional mitochondria, may be involved in the
repression of both Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes in Ft-infected macrophages. In specific aim 1, we will
investigate the mechanism of induction of mitophagy in Ft-infected macrophages. In specific aim 2, we will
Investigate how repression of Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes in response to Ft infection is linked to mitophagy.
The results will continue to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of tularemia. These studies
will elucidate how repression of Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasomes are linked to a common pathway in Ft-infected
macrophages. This continuation proposal will provide additional opportunities for training undergraduate and
master’s students."

rapid, efficient access to novel chiral building blocks bearing the hydrazine/amine-

In 2020, an estimated 77,240 people in the US will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 19,940
will die from this cancer. NHL incidence rates increased over the last half of the 20th century and only recently
stabilized. In parallel, NHL survival rates began improving in the mid-1990s with the advent of improved treatment
strategies, leading to the current 5-year survival rate of 74%. These trends have led to a growth in the number
of NHL survivors, estimated at over 757,000 in 2019. To address the unmet health needs of this patient
population, we established the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study, which by June 2020
will have enrolled over 13,000 NHL patients and have <1% lost to follow-up. The LEO cohort supports multiple
grants and has generated novel and high impact findings on NHL prognosis and survivorship. To continue and
expand the key contributions of LEO, in this renewal we propose to: 1) Extend recruitment at all 8 LEO centers,
with a goal of recruiting 3400 newly diagnosed NHL patients focused on Hispanic (N=900), African American
(N=580), and Asian (N=200) participants (doubling the current sample size for these groups) and adolescent
and young adult (AYA) participants age 18-39 years (N=870; 87% increase), and non-metro and rural patients
of all ages and race/ethnicities (N=1,208, 72% increase), for a total cohort of 16,500 patients; 2) Review all
pathology diagnoses and maintain a NHL tumor bank that includes an H&E slide, formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue samples in a tissue microarray, and extracted tumor DNA and RNA; 3) Collect a peripheral
blood sample and maintain a central biorepository of DNA, serum, plasma and buffy coat; 4) Annotate and
harmonize all cases with clinical, epidemiologic, pathology and treatment data, including development of new
informatics enhancements to capture clinical data from electronic health records, digital pathology images and
linkage to public databases to enhance data on environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors; 5)
Prospectively follow patients in the cohort to ascertain disease progression/relapse, retreatment, transformation,
second cancers, survival (including cause of death), updated exposures, patient- reported outcomes
(PROs), and other long-term health outcomes; and 6) Facilitate research projects that use this infrastructure,
promote interactions with NCI-supported clinical trials networks, patient advocacy groups, and other
collaborators. The goal of this Research Supplement is to gain a better understanding of how Hispanic
patients with lymphoma perceive lymphoma clinical trials, the barriers and/or facilitators to clinical trial
enrollment and various factors that influence ability or desire to participate in a clinical trial. We will
achieve these aims through close coordination of the participating centers. The LEO cohort is an exceptional
resource that supports a broad research agenda aimed at identifying novel clinical, epidemiologic, germline
genetic, tumor, and treatment factors that influence NHL prognosis and survivorship focusing on NCI research
priorities in AYA, minority, and rural populations."
10974113,"Neural Mechanisms Underlying Central Induction of Skeletal Muscle Thermogenesis
Individual health and the US health-care system as a whole both suffer from the deleterious consequences of
obesity. Yet, weight loss and maintenance have proven difficult for the majority of people. Developing methods
to amplify energy expenditure would ease this process. We have found that exposing rats or mice to the odor
of their natural predator (ferret) provokes a rapid and robust rise in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius)
temperature, with a corresponding increase in caloric expenditure. We have found that, at the level of skeletal
muscle, uncoupling of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) Ca2+ cycling occurs in response to
predator threat in rats. Within the brain, activation of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons in the central and
dorsomedial ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) are sufficient to provoke muscle thermogenesis in mice. Here,
we investigate the ability of AMPK inactivation in the VMH to induce skeletal muscle thermogenesis,
specifically in response to predator threat. First, using Western blots to probe phospho-AMPK and total AMPK
from brain micropunches of the VMH, we will determine if AMPK is rapidly dephosphorylated and inactivated in
the VMH after exposure to predator (ferret) odor. Immunofluorescence will identify activation of potential cell
subpopulations in the VMH. We will probe the VMH active kinome using kinomics arrays and bioinformatics
analyses. We will also compare the ability of predator odor to alter AMPK activation in contrasting rat models of
leanness and obesity that show differential muscle thermogenesis and response to predator odor. Second, we
will assess the ability of inhibition and activation of VMH AMPK to modulate muscle thermogenesis.
Specifically, we will determine if inhibition of AMPK using microinjections of SBI-0206965 into the VMH induces
muscle thermogenesis and augments energy expenditure, and conversely if the AMPK activator AICAR will
block the ability of predator odor to trigger muscle thermogenesis. Altogether, these aims will demonstrate the
importance of an intracellular metabolic fuel sensor in the ability of a contextual stimulus to alter metabolic
outcomes. In the process, we will continue to engage undergraduate students in meaningful research
experience."
10975735,"Project Summary
Repeated episodes of binge alcohol drinking dysregulate serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) systems
throughout the brain, which may place an individual at greater risk of developing an alcohol use disorder
(AUD). The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is one site of 5-HT innervation that has been shown to undergo plastic
changes after heavy alcohol intake. Previous work has indicated that chronic alcohol exposure disrupts 5-HT
signaling in the OFC, leading to a loss of its inhibitory control in this region. Preliminary findings from the
parent R00 grant show that binge-like patterns of alcohol intake alter OFC activity across multiple species
and produce profound impairments in 5-HT1A receptor signaling in this region. However, this work from our
group and others has focused primarily on pyramidal neurons when evaluating alcohol’s impact on the OFC.
Of note, the OFC has a complex microcircuitry that contains interspersed GABA interneurons (INs) that fine-
tune the activity patterns of pyramidal cells and other IN populations. These cortical INs, which can be
broadly classified based on their expression of parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST), appear to serve
distinct roles in the coordination of OFC activity. Given the complex microcircuitry of the OFC and interplay
between its mixed neuronal populations, it will be informative to examine the broader cellular network in
which alcohol-induced adaptations may occur. At present, the impact of binge intake on OFC PV-INs and
SST-INs remains unknown. The project proposed by the supplement candidate will address this knowledge
gap through a series of experiments that evaluate plasticity induced by binge-like alcohol drinking in PV-INs
and SST-INs and its effect on 5-HT signaling in these cell populations. In Aim 1, the candidate will perform
whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings in the OFC of PV and SST reporter mice following
repeated cycles of binge alcohol intake. Specifically, the candidate will examine changes in excitability,

will use fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure the effect of binge alcohol on 5-HT receptor mRNA
expression levels in OFC PV and SST INs. In addition to yielding novel information, this supplement award
will add to the candidate’s existing scientific toolkit by allowing him to receive training in more advanced
cellular and molecular techniques, including ex vivo electrophysiology, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and
confocal microscopy. Beyond technical training, this diversity supplement will provide the candidate with
professional development opportunities and an individualized mentoring plan that will support his graduate

10975744,"Project Summary/Abstract: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) occurs up to 30% of COVID-19
infections and has emerged as a significant healthcare issue in the US. The mechanisms, optimal diagnostic
imaging tests, and therapies for persistent cardiac symptoms caused by PASC remain unknown. The CDC
describes PASC symptoms as difficult to explain and manage due to lack of knowledge and reliable test. This
study seeks to define the mechanism of persistent chest pain caused by PASC and establish an optimal cardiac
imaging test for guiding therapy. To minimize the influence of confounders, this project focuses on well-
characterized patients with persistent chest pain, which occurs in about 20% of PASC patients. Endothelial
inflammation and injury are important manifestations of acute COVID-19 infection, which may result in chronic
coronary microcirculatory dysfunction (CMD). Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the ideal
“one-stop-shop” imaging test for PASC patients with persistent chest pain, because it does not involve ionizing
radiation (i.e. safe for repetitive surveillance), is a proven modality for CMD, and uses standard clinical MRI
hardware and contrast agents; furthermore, it affords a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular
abnormalities, including: obstructive coronary artery disease (coronary magnetic resonance angiography),
pulmonary hemodynamics (4D flow), myocardial inflammation (T2, T1), scar (late gadolinium enhancement),
diffuse fibrosis (extracellular volume fraction [ECV]), and contractile dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction
[LVEF], RVEF, strain). A comprehensive CMR is necessary to adjusts for potential confounders. Our central
hypothesis is that CMD is the mechanism for chest pain in a substantial proportion of symptomatic PASC
patients, despite having normal lung function and no history of heart disease prior to COVID infection. To test
our hypothesis, we will conduct a matched case-control study comparing MPRs between well-characterized
PASC patients with persistent chest pain, asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors matched for sex, age,
race/ethnicity, CAD risk factors, vaccine status, and severity of acute COVID illness, and matched healthy
controls. The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine whether CMR-derived MPR quantification is accurate
and precise; to determine whether MPR quantification and coronary MRA adds incremental value for diagnosing
CMD; (2) to determine whether MPRs are reduced in PASC patients with chest pain due to symptom status
and/or prior COVID infection; to determine whether MPRs predict chest pain better than other CMR indices,
clinical profiles, and blood biomarkers; (3) to determine whether temporal changes in MPRs differ between
treated and untreated PASC patients; whether temporal changes in MPRs correlate with temporal changes in
angina status. This proposal has high potential impact on PASC patients suffering from chest pain by identifying
and quantifying the mechanism of persistent chest pain, informing future development and applications of
mechanism-directed therapies for CMD, and ultimately improving cardiovascular health."
10973848,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This grant will support the purchase of a next-generation Siemens 3 Tesla human MRI scanner for mental health
research in the integrated PET-MRI facility at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. The
proposed instrument will replace an existing, 16+-year-old obsolete 3 Tesla MRI scanner that is reaching end-
of-support status by the vendor and has seen diminishing usage over the last 5 years. We have recently secured
a replacement for the 15+-year-old Siemens BrainPET prototype that currently resides in this obsolete 3T
scanner. To make full use of the integrated capabilities of the PET-MRI system and expand our capacity for a
continually growing base of users, we now seek to upgrade the 3T MRI scanner to a next-generation 3T system
equipped with high-performance gradients up to 200 mT/m in strength and 200 T/m/s in slew rate. The proposed
system exceeds the capabilities of current commercially available 3T MRI systems and will represent the first
system of its kind to be integrated with a PET system, enabling investigations into the cellular-scale structure
and circuitry of the human brain with unprecedented detail and molecular specificity. The instrument offers a
substantial increase in performance for investigators at Mass General Brigham and the greater Boston area,
justified on a shared-use basis by over 25 users and 30 NIMH- and NIH-funded projects in PET-MR. The breadth
of supported mental health research spans translational neuroimaging, therapeutic neuromodulation, and
cognitive, psychiatric, and basic neuroscience studies in mental disorders such as major depressive disorder,
bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Alzheimer’s
disease. The system to be replaced uses outdated hardware and software and has required excessive servicing
with downtime of up to 30%, placing substantial pressure on our other 3T systems, which are highly utilized and
cannot accommodate our expanding user community. The next-generation 3T MRI features: higher performance
gradients; enhanced RF architecture; higher density specialized coils; the latest standardized hardware and
software for multi-site studies; faster computer enabling modern imaging techniques; integrated physiological
monitoring; new sequence and application packages for accelerated, multi-contrast exams; and an up-to-date
testbed for the unique technology development performed at the Martinos Center. The new instrument is
supported at a high level by MGB leadership, the Radiology Department, and the Martinos Center, covering the
allocation of space and costs for installation, operational support, and maintenance, including an exceptional
financial commitment to cover the gap between the NIH instrumentation award and purchase price of the
upgrade. By serving a highly productive interdisciplinary group of NIMH- and NIH-funded investigators, the
proposed upgrade will offer a cutting-edge research resource that will push the frontiers of investigating brain
structure-function relationships at finer scales and higher sensitivity and specificity, thereby providing our
investigators with the technological edge required for innovative research in mental health and mental disorders."

This goal of this K01 is to provide the mentorship and training for Dr. Sarah Gordon to become an independent
investigator studying access to mental health services among low-income populations. Nationally, 1 in 8
women experience symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD), and rates of PPD are twice as high among
women enrolled in Medicaid compared to commercially-insured women. This research examines the effects of
postpartum Medicaid eligibility and benefit policies on PPD care among low-income women using a two-phase
explanatory mixed-methods design. Aims 1 and 2 will analyze secondary data from a novel linked database of
all payer claims data, birth certificates, and individual-level income data, consistent with NIMH’s strategic
objective to combine data from multiple sources of information to identify underserved groups. Using a
regression discontinuity design, Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of retaining Medicaid eligibility beyond the
pregnancy-related Medicaid eligibility limit of 60 days postpartum on utilization rates across the PPD care
continuum: screening, diagnosis and treatment. Aim 2 will use a difference-in-differences approach to measure
the effects of Medicaid reimbursement for PPD screening during well-child visits on PPD screening, diagnosis,
and treatment rates in the postpartum year, comparing outcomes among women who maintain versus lose
Medicaid eligibility at 60 days postpartum. Aims 1 and 2 will implement multi-level modeling techniques to
examine county-level moderators of policy effects. In Aim 3, I will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews
with key policy informants, providers, and patient focus groups to explore how postpartum Medicaid policies
impact access to PPD services. Purposive qualitative sampling and will be guided by county-level moderators
of policy effects observed in Aims 1 and 2 and a geospatial cluster analysis of patterns of high and low rates of
PPD screening and treatment.
Dr. Sarah Gordon is an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. She has four key
training objectives: (1) acquire content expertise in the organization and delivery of mental health services, with
a focus on maternal mental health; (2) develop skills in mixed-methods research; (3) develop qualitative data
collection and analysis methods, and (4) acquire skills to measure and map area-level variation in policy
effects. Postpartum mental health conditions are a leading cause of preventable postpartum maternal morbidity
mortality. The goal of this proposal is to examine the effects of Medicaid policies in order to increase detection
and treatment of PPD, thereby improving postpartum mental health. This research is responsive to NIMH’s
high priority research area on women’s mental health during the perinatal period and consistent with priorities
outlined in the NIMH Strategic Plan, including to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH research."
10973774,"Project Summary
Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH) is characterized by somatic mutations originating from a few hematopoietic stem
cell clones. CH is well known to be an age associated phenomenon and is associated with an increased risk of
developing hematologic neoplasms, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality , but paradoxically is
associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The complex relationship between CH, aging and age-
related diseases requires a thorough investigation. Cohorts enriched for exceptional longevity and in particular
centenarians (age > 95 years), have been extensively studied to gain deep insights into human lifespan as well
as healthspan. They exhibit significant delays in mortality and in the incidence of age-related diseases, such as
cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and Alzheimers Disease (AD).
Our research proposal will investigate CH in a unique population that is enriched for exceptional longevity,
focusing on the trajectory of CH during healthy aging, its association with clinical outcomes and protection from
age-related diseases. The study will be conducted in two unique Ashkenazi Jewish longevity cohorts at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. They are well-characterized clinically and have comprehensive genetic,
proteomic, and methylomic data available for analysis.
Aim 1: Determine the prevalence and mutational spectrum of CH and its relationship with age-related
diseases in populations with exceptional longevity. In this aim, the prevalence and mutational spectrum of
CH in centenarians, their offspring, and in sex- and age-matched controls will be compared at baseline. We will
examine the associations between CH and clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that exceptional longevity is
associated with a lower age adjusted CH prevalence, distinct CH mutational patterns and reduced risk of age-
related diseases in the presence of CH.
Aim 2: Establish the evolution of CH in aging and longevity. We will analyze longitudinal DNA samples to
identify incident CH and study changes prospectively in clonal populations over a 5-year period. We
hypothesize that the incidence of CH and clonal profiles will differ between offspring and controls.
Aim 3: Identify the biological pathways that modify the risk of CH and CH-related diseases. We will
conduct targeted and untargeted multi-omic analyses to identify longevity-related genetic variants, proteins and
DNA methylation profiles related to CH and its clinical associations. We hypothesize that longevity-related
genotypes can afford protection against the emergence of harmful CH variants."
10973901,"Newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often undergo invasive procedures or surgeries that cause prolonged pain. Cumulative pain exposures during early brain development alter brain growth, decrease brain volume, and lead to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Therefore, monitoring and treating neonatal pain is a central goal of NICU care, and opioid-based pain regimens are regularly used to treat pain after surgery. However, prolonged opioid exposures can also lead to delayed feeding, prolonged mechanical ventilation, impaired brain growth, and neurodevelopmental sequelae. Optimally, neonatal pain should be managed to minimize pain, stress, and opioid exposures. If bedside nurses can detect the infant’s pain while it is still mild, then non-opioid drugs and non-pharmacologic therapies can be used to prevent it from becoming severe. Thus, optimized post-surgical analgesia will protect neonates from the trauma of either prolonged acute pain vs. prolonged opioid exposures, and the long-term effects of both these on the newborn brain. However, measuring neonatal pain accurately and consistently is difficult, as the current approaches are subjective and unreliable when practiced by different NICU nurses. Nursing workload in the NICU also does not allow for continuous pain assessment and monitoring.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop an automated pain monitoring system that objectively measures pain continuously based on several biomarkers. The proposed Neonatal Pain Monitoring System (NPMS) will prompt the nurse with pain alarms, coupled with a pain management protocol that minimizes pain, stress, and opioid dosing during post-operative neonatal care.  This project in the UG3 phase aims to: 1) develop and validate AI-driven neonatal pain biomarker signatures and an automated NPMS that can constantly assess neonatal pain to identify the onset and offset of postoperative pain, 2) create a pain management protocol that utilizes the information provided by NPMS to minimize postoperative pain and opioid use. The UH3 phase aims to complete a randomized controlled trial using postoperative pain scores, clinical outcomes, pain-related stress, acute pain events, pain trajectories, and provider surveys to compare the two randomized groups with and without AI-driven pain biomarker monitoring.  Expected outcomes include neonatal pain biomarker signature models, an automated NPMS that uses these models, and a pain management protocol that utilizes NPMS to minimize postoperative pain and opioid use. These novel tools will equip the bedside nurses to manage surgical newborn pain pre-emptively and more effectively, which will reduce central sensitization, thus reducing pain scores (primary outcome), the need for opioids or other analgesics/sedatives, and improving their post-surgical clinical outcomes (secondary outcomes). This collaborative, multi-disciplinary team has the track-records, advanced skills, and access to sufficient patient populations to successfully execute the proposed aims and significantly advance the field of post-surgical care."
10973906,"Project Summary
 Advances in organic synthesis have enabled the construction of increasingly complex peptide drugs and
natural products. However, access to many important peptides is still hindered or prevented by limitations in
current methods. Accordingly, the objective of this project is to discover new synthetic methods and apply them
to constructing bioactive peptide natural products. The hypothesis is that the proposed methods will enable
efficient construction of peptides that will be used to accelerate advances in medicinal chemistry and chemical
biology. The rationale for this idea is that pushing back the frontiers of peptide synthesis will unlock access to
unexplored areas of peptide chemical space, providing valuable new tools to medicinal chemists and chemical
biologists in the fight against disease. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims. Aim 1
involves devising a universal method of synthesizing ,-dehydroamino acids and streamlining their
incorporation into peptides. Eliminations of -nitroamino acids will be explored for this purpose. The process will
first be optimized in solution with model tripeptide substrates. Then, on-resin eliminations will be developed in
the context of a library of tunicyclin B analogs. Aim 2 entails determining the structure of the anticancer peptide
prethioviridamide through synthesis of the candidate diastereomers. A convergent approach involving late-stage
coupling of macrocycles and thioamide-rich hexapeptides will be pursued. The macrocycles will be synthesized
in solution, and the hexapeptides will be assembled on solid support. Aim 3 consists of developing a new serine
ligation protocol. The combination of carboxylate alkylation and O-to-N acyl transfer will be used to ligate peptide
segments and achieve macrocyclizations, with both processes occurring without epimerization. Various
electrophiles and N-methylated nucleophiles will be studied. Cyclic peptides ranging from four to eight residues
will be targeted by the macrocyclization investigation. The approach is innovative because it features the
development of novel synthetic methods such as eliminations of resin-bound -nitroamino acids, convergent
couplings of macrocyclic -thioenamides with linear polythioamides, and ligations that use the carboxylate as a
nucleophile instead of an electrophile. The significance of the proposed research lies in its ability to facilitate the
synthesis of peptides that can be used to solve important medicinal chemistry and chemical biology problems.
Such studies could include the use of ,-dehydroamino acids to impart rigidity and proteolytic stability to
bioactive peptides, the design and synthesis of potent and stable analogs of prethioviridamide as anticancer
agents, and the synthesis of medicinally relevant peptides via epimerization-free serine ligations. This project is
envisioned to create new synthetic methods that will facilitate exciting advances in medicinal chemistry and
chemical biology."

ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) couple a cell’s metabolic state to its electrical excitability. This
process is crucial in pancreatic β-cells where KATP couples glucose uptake to insulin secretion.
In the heart, KATP plays a protective role, opening during hypoxia. The role of these channels is
so vital that KATP dysfunction is associated with diseases of insulin secretion, with severe
mutations causing treatment-resistant syndromes with accompanying neurological deficits. To
study this critical channel, we developed spectroscopic tools that allow us to simultaneously
probe KATP structure and function. This is an ideal approach for understanding KATP’s
physiological role and probing long-standing questions of biochemistry. How is the input of
energy from ligand binding coupled to changes in protein function? How can one
mechanistically separate ligand binding from protein activation? How is long-range
communication achieved between subunits in a multi-protein complex?
KATP comprises four pore-forming inward-rectifier K+ channel subunits (Kir), each associated
with a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). The connection between KATP and metabolism is
established by ATP/ADP binding to three classes of nucleotide binding site (NBS). Binding to Kir
shuts KATP; binding to two sites on SUR opens KATP. Thus, channel activity is a function of the
occupancy of each NBS and their relative energetic contribution to gating. We have taken a
novel approach to understanding the role of each NBS in KATP gating: measuring site-specific
binding using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between fluorescent ATP derivatives
and channels tagged with fluorescent, non-canonical amino acids. Simultaneous recordings of
binding and ionic current allow us to model each NBS in terms of its nucleotide affinity and
energetic influence on gating. This experimental/analytical framework will be applied to examine
the difference between heart and pancreatic KATP subtypes and the consequences of KATP
mutations associated with diabetes. We will assess the enzymatic activity of SUR (an ATPase)
with mutations in putative catalytic amino acids and novel fluorescent non-hydrolyzable ATP
derivatives synthesized in house. Finally, we will probe the structural basis of coupling between
the Kir and SUR subunits using an enhanced FRET technique in which colored metal ions are
used as short-distance fluorescence quenchers. These combined approaches will yield a new
appreciation for the physiological role of KATP and its dysfunction in certain forms of diabetes.
Novel insights into the energetics and conformational dynamics of KATP will provide a template
for understanding the behavior of other protein complexes."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset neurological disease in which motor neurons
degenerate, thereby leading to paralysis and death due to respiratory failure. The incidence of ALS differs based
on ancestral origin, with ~5.5 cases per 100,000 persons in the United States. In addition to motor function
impairment, a subset of patients (~15%) suffers from frontotemporal dementia (FTD), leading to low quality of
life and extreme emotional strain on the patient’s caregivers. From a genetic perspective, ALS pathogenesis is
commonly driven by GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene, which cause a disease subtype
of ALS referred to as c9ALS/FTD. The repeat expansions lead to C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency, accumulation of
repeat RNA, and the production of aggregation-prone proteins composed of repeating dipeptides. While
antisense oligonucleotides and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches have been used to target the causal
mutations of ALS, these approaches are limited due to their transient effect, lack of specificity, and inability to
multiplex. Gene editing technologies have emerged as powerful approaches to target causal drivers of rare
diseases and engineer cell-based therapeutics. Therefore, there is a critical need for a gene editing-based
therapy that can safely and efficiently deplete the disease-causing mutant C9ORF72. The original CRISPR/Cas9
system that targets DNA is limited in this context since repeat expansions are at the kilobase scale and cannot
be efficiently deleted with current Cas9-based technologies. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a
gene therapy for ALS using the Acrobat Genomics proprietary enARGN gene editing system, which is more
compact than the CRISPR/Cas9 system and more deliverable. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the
activity of Acrobat Genomics ARGN gene editing system. In this Phase I SBIR project, Acrobat Genomics plans
to develop a high-throughput protein engineering platform (AcrobaTx) to enhance ARGN gene editing activity.
The protein engineering approach is enabled by advancements in high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis,
sequencing technologies, and protein language models. Notably, the approach utilizes pooled screening and is
highly parallel to enable the study of thousands of proteins in a single experiment (Specific Aim 1). With an
optimized ARGN protein, a novel editing strategy will be developed to deplete expression of mutant C9ORF72
and restore expression of the wild-type allele (Specific Aim 2). In summary, by protein engineering the ARGN
system, Acrobat Genomics will develop a new therapy for ALS, which is currently a devastating and incurable
disease with few treatment options. In addition to the proposed research investigations, this application will lay
the foundation for the entrepreneurial career development of the PI. The PI is the co-inventor of foundational
technologies used in this proposal and has co-founded Acrobat Genomics. The PI aims to transition from
academia to commercialize the enARGN system as a therapeutic for genetic diseases and has identified mentors
with significant business and scientific expertise to aid in this endeavor."

Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) is an effective but underused treatment for Opioid Use Disorder
(OUD), reducing drug use and mortality at rates far superior to any other treatment modality. Current approved
medications include methadone (a full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist), and naltrexone (an
opioid antagonist). Despite its efficacy, MOUD remains heavily stigmatized by decision makers, healthcare
personnel, and members of the general public (i.e., three stigma actor groups), with potential for differential
endorsement and experience of stigma based on lived experience of OUD and racial identity. Existing qualitative
research suggests this form of Intervention Stigma, manifesting both as negative attitudes (e.g., “it’s replacing
one addiction for another,” “it’s not ‘real recovery,’”) as well as actions (e.g., prohibitions on MOUD in residential
environments, poor reimbursement in medical settings) are driven by beliefs regarding the following domains: 1)
MOUD’s differing pharmacological properties (opioid agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists), 2) prioritization
of psychosocial interventions over medication, 3) regulatory and administrative burdens, 4) the value of
experiential knowledge and professional anecdote over scientific research or client experience, and 5) suspicion
of profit motives associated with MOUD. Evidence also suggests there is a sixth domain, risk of MOUD diversion
(selling and sharing medications), influencing Intervention Stigma. Though qualitative work helps illuminate the
sub-constructs of Intervention Stigma, there remains no comprehensive model or quantitative measure of
Intervention Stigma for use in academic or clinical settings which captures the nuance of stigmatizing attitudes
and actions across stigma actor groups, subpopulations, domains, routes of administration (injection vs. oral),
and the three medication types. The proposed study aims to develop a dimensional model of Intervention
Stigma by leveraging strong, statewide and national collaborations to engage with subject matter experts
through the validated delphi and cognitive interviewing techniques to test and refine domains of interest and
specific items. Following the establishment of the comprehensive model, the research team will develop and
test an Intervention Stigma measure tailored for the three target actor groups and apply modern,
multidimensional psychometric approaches to identify response patterns, scale structures, and establish
construct and convergent validity evidence for each actor group version, using both online and in-person formats
with large sample populations across diverse settings. Critically, the research team will consist of undergraduate
and graduate student scholars and will build strong substance use focused research and training
infrastructure within the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. The
long-term goal of this project is to inform effective, tailored, stigma-reducing interventions, thus decreasing
system- and individual-level barriers to this life-saving intervention while strengthening the research acumen of
future addiction scientists."

Epigenetic regulation is one of eukaryotic cells' most central and complex processes. Enzymatic
demethylation of N𝜀-methylated lysine residues in histone proteins is performed almost
exclusively by non-heme Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) - dependent histone demethylases
(KDMs). KDMs are divided into six classes (KDM2-8), which differ in their specificity towards the
methylation state of the lysine residues and the position of the lysine residue in the sequence of
the histone proteins. Importantly, KDMs from different classes are involved in diverse steps of
epigenetic regulation and are linked to various pathologic processes, including cancers and other
genetic disorders. The catalytic mechanisms of KDMs with standard histone substrates containing
methyl groups (HSCMGs), including the dioxygen (O2) binding, activation, and substrate
oxidation, have been comprehensively explored by us during the previous award period; however,
the diverse catalytic mechanisms of KDMs with histone substrates containing lysine residues
with large alkyl groups (HSCLAGs) are entirely unexplored. Experimental studies show that
human KDMs such as KDM2A, KDM4E, KDM6B, and KDM7B can catalyze diverse
transformations with a variety of HSCLAGs implementing different chemical mechanisms such
as hydroxylations, hydroxylations followed by dealkylations, and sequential hydroxylations,
however, the catalytic mechanisms of these transformations remain unknown.
Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal is to elucidate how KDMs perform catalysis of
HSCLAGs compared to HSCMGs regarding the primary substrate binding, dioxygen transport
and binding, and their diverse reaction mechanisms. Subjects of our study are four human
KDMs from four different classes (2, 4, 6, and 7), which differ in their structure and substrate
specificities, namely KDM2A, KDM4E, KDM6B, and KDM7B.
An exciting aspect of the research plan is that it will provide motivated undergraduate students
with a unique opportunity to engage in top class research using modern computational and
experimental methods in line with the mission of the Academic Research Enhancement Award."
10974389,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 70% of older adults experience medication discrepancy–inconsistencies in medication regimens when
they transition from acute hospital to skilled nursing facilities (SNF). Medication discrepancy in this period often
results from inadequate reconciliation processes and formulary or financial restrictions in hospitals or SNFs.
Medication discrepancy can take the various forms, including omission, addition, duplication, and substitution.
Among these types, substitution accounts for up to 20% and frequently involves cardiovascular medications.
Clinical observations suggest that newer, high-cost cardiometabolic medications (e.g., angiotensin receptor
neprilysin inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) are
often substituted with less expensive and less efficacious alternatives in SNFs. Such substitutions may impact
chronic disease outcomes if the modified regimen is continued after SNF stay. Despite the common occurrence
of medication substitution during SNF stays and its potential clinical significance, systematic investigation has
been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive database containing medication administration records from a
large number of SNFs. The objective of this study is to determine the epidemiology and clinical consequences
of cardiometabolic medication substitution in SNF. The investigators’ hypothesis is that persistent medication
substitution beyond SNF stay is associated with worse outcomes compared with no substitution or resolved
substitution during SNF stay. To test this hypothesis, they will use the Long-Term Care Data Cooperative platform,
which provides electronic health records data from nationwide SNFs linked with Medicare data. The specific
aims are: 1) to determine the frequency and factors associated with cardiometabolic medication substitution
during post-acute SNF stay among older adults after elective orthopedic surgery; and 2) to determine long-term
chronic disease outcomes associated with cardiometabolic medication substitution during post-acute SNF stay.
The project is innovative because it is the first national-scale study of medication substitution during the post-
acute SNF stay. The impact of this research is significant because the evidence generated from this research
can enable optimal medication management of cardiometabolic conditions in the transitional period. Moreover,
the GEMSSTAR award will provide mentorship, training, and experience for the Principal Investigator to emerge
as a leader in optimizing medication use for older adults."

Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer from subtle cognitive impairments and structural alterations in the
brain. These impairments progress with age and may eventually lead to increased difficulty managing the
disease, resulting in worsening glycemic control, potentially life-threatening complications, and reductions in
quality of life. Causes of cognitive decline in T1D are not well understood. Episodes of hypoglycemia, chronic
hyperglycemia, glycemic variability and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have all been suggested to play roles. Our
team at the University of Colorado proposes to join a multicenter NIH consortium to investigate the impact of
T1D on neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning in pre-pubertal children. We propose collaborative
development of the study protocol, enrollment of a representative study population, and prospective follow-up to
collect exposure and outcomes data for hypothesis testing. This study will further elucidate the role of DKA,
chronic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia and established or emerging treatment modalities on
neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning of pre-pubertal children followed for up to three years after T1D
diagnosis.
We propose to test the following hypotheses:
H1: DKA at diagnosis of T1D has a detrimental long-term effect on neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning
(including full scale IQ), independent of sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
H2: Chronic hyperglycemia exposure, assessed by repeatedly measured HbA1c or CGM time above range
(TAR >250), has a detrimental long-term effect on neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning, independently
of sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status of the child.
H3: Recurrent severe hypoglycemia or excessive time below range (TBR <70 mg/dl) has a detrimental long-term
effect on neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning, independently of sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and glycemic control assessed by HbA1c or time in range (TIR 70-180).
H4: Routine vs occasional use of CGM has a protective long-term effect on neurocognitive and psychosocial
functioning, independently of sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status of the child and average HbA1c.
The proposed studies will help to further understand the impact of DKA, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and
current diabetes management modalities on the developing brain, including neurocognitive and psychosocial
functioning."
10973722,"ABSTRACT
 Glucose is the most important source of energy for proper brain development and functioning; therefore,
any imbalance in glucose is associated with changes in neurodevelopment. Hypo- and hyperglycemia impact
brain structure and functioning and cognitive abilities across the lifespan and it is well-established that older
adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience cognitive impairment. Indeed, individuals with T1D have a 65%
increased risk for dementia later in life compared to 37% in those with type 2 diabetes. Increasing glucose
metabolism during childhood is related to growth of healthy brain structures and connections; but for
individuals with early childhood onset of T1D, decreases in brain structures and functions and lower
neurocognitive abilities and IQ occur. Brain imaging studies of individuals with T1D demonstrate reductions in
total brain volume and gray and white matter density in the cerebellum; and changes in the frontal, parietal,
and temporal lobes; hippocampus; thalamus; and various structures in the occipital lobe. Individuals with T1D
generally demonstrate challenges with mental flexibility, intelligence, memory, executive functioning, and
processing speed with earlier age of onset, longer T1D duration, suboptimal glycemia, hypo- and
hyperglycemia and extreme glycemic variability, and diabetic ketoacidosis serving as risk factors for worse
cognitive performance, lower IQ, and brain structural changes. Studies focused on neuroimaging and
neurocognition in the context of T1D biomarkers, social determinants of health, sleep and psychological,
social, and school functioning with children with new-onset T1D in the United States are extremely sparse.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these gaps in the extant literature to identify opportunities to
prevent or mitigate cognitive challenges across the lifespan. The overarching goals of the Diabetes Brain and
Cognitive Development – Type 1 Diabetes (DBCD-T1) study are to 1) understand the impact of T1D on brain
and neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning; 2) examine risk and protective factors associated with T1D-
related neurocognitive impact; and 3) assess associations of diabetes technologies and neurocognitive
functioning in children with T1D. We will recruit n=160 prepubescent children with new-onset T1D and their
caregivers from the Northwest, North Central, and Northeast districts of Florida, with sociodemographic
characteristics representative of the US population of children with T1D. Study tasks include brain imaging and
comprehensive neurocognitive and academic testing (e.g., IQ, memory, executive functioning, processing
speed, reading, mathematics, writing); questionnaire completion (e.g., anxiety, depression, quality of life,
resilience, fear of hypoglycemia, T1D family conflict, diabetes distress); and collection of biological (e.g.,
autoantibodies, C-peptide), sleep (actigraphy), and diabetes device and glycemic data (e.g., device downloads,
A1C). Throughout the study, we will continuously partner with and consult our Community Advisory Board
using principles of community engagement and science to maximize the success of our aims."

most prominent features of speech processing differences include challenges perceiving social and emotional
cues from speech signals, and perception of speech in noisy environments. Such difficulties have been theorized
to relate to differences in context-dependent auditory processing. That is, autistic individuals appear less
adept in using global acoustic and statistical contexts (e.g., the likelihood of one speech sound following a particular
sequence of speech sounds or words) to hone in on important aspects of speech signals and suppress irrelevant
auditory signals (e.g., noise) in everyday speech environments, with important clinical consequences. Critically,
the biological and mechanistic origins of this important functional difference in ASD remain unclear. Recent
studies have demonstrated that in typical development, context-dependent auditory processing is mechanistically
supported by an interaction between top-down modulation and local representations of speech that fine-tune
sensory signals based on expectations computed from auditory history. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis
that the homeostasis (i.e., balance) between top-down and local representations of speech signals is disrupted in
ASD, which manifests system-wise along the neural auditory pathway. We propose a set of multi-level, advanced
and innovative encephalography (EEG) approaches to study how autistic individuals incorporate contextual
information to support speech processing in both fundamental encoding of speech sounds and higher order
processing of continuous speech samples. To establish the clinical relevance of context-dependent auditory
processing, we further test a hypothesis that these brain signatures relate and contribute to key clinical-behavioral
speech and language phenotypes related to the social communication domain of ASD. Results of this study will
provide important mechanistic insight to help unpack the currently insufficiently understood etiology of functional
speech processing difficulties in ASD. As speech processing is crucial in our daily lives (e.g., from the development
of friendships through talking and listening, to workplace communication), understanding the causes and
underlying mechanisms of speech processing differences in ASD has broad clinical-behavioral implications,
essential for the development of effective, mechanistically targeted interventions to improve quality of life. Elicited
with innovative and mechanistically apt experimental paradigms that reflect real-world experiences and clinically-
translatable EEG techniques with clear biological bases, our hypothesized neural markers of context-dependent
auditory processing in ASD has great potential as an objective and robust tool to be implemented in translational
research to predict and measure clinical improvements in speech- and language-related interventions."

Common genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies have been reproducibly
associated with risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the function of many risk variants are unknown and likely
context-specific. At the same time, several environmental exposures have been implicated in AD and dementia,
including particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5), heavy metals (especially lead (Pb)), and infections. We posit
that the genetic architecture of AD includes gene-environment interactions (GxE) between common, non-coding
variants and environmental exposure. Here, we propose to identify these GxE using an in vitro model, ""GxE in
a dish"", using the inherent genetic diversity in a population of neural cells exposed to AD-relevant environmental
exposures. We will test the context-specific function of common genetic variation in 100 induced pluripotent stem
cell donors differentiated to cortical organoids. We will expose the organoids to PM2.5, Pb, infection mimics (LPS
+ IFNγ), or vehicle. We will collect scRNA-seq data from each exposed organoid, allowing inference of context-
specific single cell expression quantitative trait loci (QTL). To find genetic variants associated with neural cell
survival, we will additionally generate chimeric brain organoids composed of cells derived from multiple
independent donors. We will use the Census-seq approach to determine the proportion of each donor within the
chimeric organoids in response to the exposures described above. We will then conduct a genetic association
study to find common variants associated with differential survival response to these environmental exposures.
To complement our in vitro cell culture model, we will also identify GxE effects on brain structure in vivo using a
large population scale database. We will then colocalize context-specific eQTLs, survival QTLs, and in vivo brain
QTLs with each other and AD GWAS loci. In all, our results will reveal new mechanisms underlying AD GWAS
loci by exploring the context-specific nature of genetic variant function using both in vitro and in vivo systems."
10974823,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome initiated by infection. Most cases of septic shock are
caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), which remains one of the most common
pathogens leading to sepsis. Understanding the mechanisms by which the mammalian immune system
differentially responds to infection by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria will place us in a better
position to treat or prevent sepsis. Members of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin family
(Siglecs) are cell surface receptors that negatively regulate the response to infection by binding or taking up
sialylated pathogens; however, most pathogens are not sialylated. We previously published a study in which
we used nonsialylated bacteria to show that Siglec-E knockout (SiglecE-/-) mice exhibited higher mortality than
wild-type (WT) mice following infection by Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. Better survival in WT
mice depended on more efficient clearance of Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, infection
with Gram-negative E. coli strains 25922 and DH5α induced the expression of Siglec-E, which promoted
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, infection with Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus
aureus or Listeria monocytogenes reduced expression of Siglec-E, which inhibited production of ROS. Based
on these findings, we designed this project to: 1) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Siglec-E in bacterial
clearance; 2) Dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying differential regulation of innate immune response
during infection with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by controlling Siglec-E; 3) Evaluate Siglec-E
as a therapeutic target for the treatment of bacterial sepsis by using CLP. These studies will not only reveal the
molecular mechanisms of the novel role of Siglec-E in bacterial clearance but also provide novel approaches
toward treatment of bacterial induced-sepsis."
10974826,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candida albicans is the number one cause of life-threatening fungal infections in hospitals. A key virulence
attribute of C. albicans is the ability to switch between multiple distinct cellular forms that are adapted to unique
environmental niches. Heritable yet reversible differentiation between “white” and “opaque” cell types generates
two distinct pathogenic forms of C. albicans derived from a single genome, with differential expression of nearly
one in five genes in the organism. Most virulence studies in C. albicans have focused on the white cell type since
most strains were believed to be incapable of switching to the opaque state without first undergoing chromosomal
rearrangements; however, this assumption has recently been shown to be untrue. Although opaque cells have
long been known to be far more adept at infecting skin than white cells, very little is known about the unique
virulence attributes of the opaque cell type, or how stochastic switching between the white and opaque cell types
contributes to the progression of an infection. Instead, our understanding of the white-opaque switch has largely
focused on the transcriptional regulatory network that controls the heritable differentiation between these two
cell types. This network bears a striking resemblance to similar networks that control cellular differentiation in
higher eukaryotes; however, equivalent programs are not found in other model yeasts like Saccharomyces
cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe, making C. albicans an attractive “simple” eukaryotic organism to
study how complex transcriptional programs are established and inherited from one generation to the next. We
propose to use a recently developed planarian model of infection, which reveals similar opaque-specific virulence
characteristics as the mouse skin model, to identify opaque-specific virulence genes. Combined with our recently
developed fluorescent switch-reporter strains, we will also investigate the yet unexplored contribution of
stochastic white-opaque switching to C. albicans virulence. These approaches are tailored to enable
undergraduate researchers to easily gain hands-on experience with animal models of fungal pathogenesis and
contribute to our understanding of an understudied aspect of C. albicans virulence while simultaneously avoiding
the high cost and added complications of vertebrate animal models. We have also found that Wor1, the master
regulator of the opaque cell type, forms large macromolecular condensates in the nuclei of opaque cells, and we
propose to use ultra-high resolution fluorescence imaging combined with molecular genetics approaches to
characterize these protein condensates and determine their role in the establishment and heritable maintenance
of the opaque cell type. Together these approaches will provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory
control of stochastic white-opaque switching, identify opaque-specific virulence genes, and inform how switching
between these two differentiated cell types contributes to epithelial adhesion and damage, and progression to
invasive candidiasis."
10974848,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To reach their therapeutic targets within the body, most drugs need to have the ability to enter cells and
traverse epithelial barriers. Achieving this hinges on efficient transportation across the cellular plasma
membrane, which is especially crucial for drugs designed to act inside cells. For the many weak acid and weak
base drugs that can occupy both charged and uncharged states at physiological pH, it is generally assumed
that simple diffusion of the uncharged species directly across the phospholipid bilayer of biological membranes
is the major passive transport pathway. However, evidence has steadily accumulated supporting a larger role
of transport proteins, carriers, and channels, in aiding the passive movement of drugs, charged and
uncharged, into and through cells. This is significant on two counts. First, it may be that for some drugs the
expression and function of facilitated transport proteins may be as influential to the pharmacokinetics
governing absorption, distribution and elimination as the expression of active transporters such as P-
glycoprotein. Second, whereas lipoidal diffusion is not a process that can be easily and selectively modified by
administered agents, the activity of many membrane transporters, particularly channel proteins, can be readily
altered by pharmacological activators and inhibitors. Given that many such proteins exhibit preferential
expression in certain cell types and tissues, there is the possibility of exploiting such pharmacologically tunable
transport mechanisms for the purposes of influencing drug transfer and enhancing the potency and selectivity
of intracellularly active therapeutics. The current proposal is inspired by our recent discovery that activation of
the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa3.1) increases the permeability of cells to the
fluorescent nuclear stains, Hoechst 33258 and DAPI through a previously uncharacterized mechanism. KCa3.1
receptors are highly expressed in epithelial cells of the blood vessels and gut, where they could potentially
influence the absorption and distribution of small cationic drugs. Additionally, they are reportedly upregulated in
many cancers, where they might be exploited as a means of targeting tumor cells with small charged
chemotherapeutics. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanism underlying this KCa3.1-dependent,
pharmacologically tunable drug transport pathway and reveal the structural characteristics that permit small
organic cations to use it."

Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) are susceptible to a dramatic decline in their ability to communicate
as a result of cancer treatment. HNC survivors may develop debilitating hearing loss as a result of treatment
with cisplatin chemotherapy and radiation. Ototoxicity monitoring leads to early detection of hearing loss, but
barriers to compliance with monitoring programs represent a missed opportunity for rehabilitation. HNC
patients may also become unable to speak or swallow as a result of surgery or radiation to the larynx or
pharynx. Older patients may be particularly vulnerable to speech and swallowing declines after cancer
treatment, but chronologic age is a poor predictor of functional outcomes. Clinical predictors of poor swallowing
and speech function are needed to inform patient counseling and shared decision making in older patients.
Aim 1 of this proposal is a randomized, controlled trial comparing standard scheduling of ototoxicity monitoring
visits for HNC patients versus an intervention aimed at increasing participation by scheduling remote
audiograms. Patients living at considerable distance from our center or those with advanced disease will be
targeted for randomization. In Aim 2, we will assess whether frailty screening tools and/or sarcopenia can be
used to predict severe speech and swallowing decline in older adults treated for HNC. This K24 will also allow
me to improve and expand mentoring of trainees and junior faculty in patient-oriented, NIDCD-relevant
research, with a focus on mentoring of medical students interested in otolaryngology. Additional training
opportunities will also allow me to expand my own patient-oriented research and mentoring skillsets, including
qualitative research, health disparities, medical ethics, database analysis and advanced biostatistical analyses."
10974767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current soft tissue repair techniques have not been able to reverse the pathological changes that occur following
volumetric muscle loss (VML) injury. The key event in the etiology of VML injury is the bulk loss of regenerative
cues provided by the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM). Persistent inflammation is a hallmark of VML injury,
and it is well-established chronic inflammation impairs skeletal muscle regeneration. To reverse the pathology
of VML injury, our group and others are exploring the use of bioengineered scaffolds such as decellularized
muscle tissue (i.e., regenerative medicine strategies) as a means of restoring lost cellular and architectural cues
to trigger muscle recovery. However, the results across several groups appear to suggest that a regenerative
ceiling exists; typically restoring no more than 80% of the contractile force lost to VML injury. What has been
overlooked is the importance of rebuilding the force environment using rehabilitative medicine (i.e., exercise).
However, combined rehabilitative and regenerative strategies have only improved force recovery up to the
current regenerative ceiling. The premise of the proposed research is twofold. This project seeks to determine
the appropriate exercise prescription (intensity and duration) that will provide an optimal force recovery response.
In addition, this project postulates that delivery of a concurrent (hypertrophic and endurance) stimulus (via
rehabilitation) into the VML repair site will enhance the performance of regenerative medicine. The premise is
supported by a preponderance of evidence, including our own preliminary data, which suggests that endurance
and hypertrophic-inducing exercise can be used to decrease inflammation, increase cellular metabolism, and
enhance muscle fiber growth, each of which have known benefits for skeletal muscle regeneration. We will
examine the impact of endurance exercise and endurance exercise with an added resistance component on
VML recovery during Aim 1 and 2 experiments, respectively. Additionally, we will use pharmacological methods
(i.e., resolvin D1) to alter the initial inflammatory period to attenuate chronic inflammation.
We propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of treadmill-based endurance exercise on attenuating the inflammatory
response during muscle recovery following regenerative repair of VML injury.
Aim 2: Determine whether addition of a hypertrophic stimulus via PoWeR will enable improved
regeneration capabilities beyond current regenerative ceiling.
This study has the potential to deliver innovative new knowledge that will advance the search for an effective
VML treatment strategy."

 Engineering and Characterization of pH dependent Antibodies
Antibody-antigen interactions have served as a prototypical model for better understanding
protein-protein interactions and protein design, as well as serving a vital role in life science
applications. Such antibodies are indispensable to a wide range of fields including cell and
molecular biology, molecular imaging, diagnostics, nanotechnology, and next generation
antibody therapeutics. While the goal of antibody engineering is most often focused on
achieving high affinity or stability, over the last several years, the Horn lab has explored new
directions in the design of protein interactions, namely the introduction of linked equilibria that
may be used to control (or regulate) antibody/antigen interactions. These efforts successfully
produced antibody variants with gain-of-function pH switches, allowing the protein interaction to
be modulated over a range in pH. This proposal aims to explore a new direction on these efforts
by investigating methods control VHH and Fab antibody interactions through the introduction of
acidic residues in the interface. This research has the potential to open new opportunities in
how antibodies may be used in therapy. Given the wide-spread use of antibodies in applications
where pH-based control provides functional advantages, the outcomes of this work are likely to
be wide interest."
10973614,"Abstract
The treatment and care of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) place a huge burden on
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. The estimated lifetime cost of care for an individual living with
ADRD is nearly $400,000. Caring for a loved one with ADRD can put family members in untenable financial
positions, such as having to decide between providing appropriate medical care for a loved one or paying for
other essential living costs. These hardships are exponentially worse for lower-income and otherwise
marginalized families, who often have inadequate insurance or resources for their loved ones with dementia.
Thus, there is a need to investigate and quantify the financial hardship that is experienced with ADRD, using
the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Framework, with the ultimate goal of ameliorating this
financial hardship, particularly among families in socioeconomically diverse or disadvantaged groups.
Due to the lack of standardized, valid measurement tools, the true financial hardships from ADRD are
unknown, and continue to go unaddressed. Current measures of financial stress and strain are general and
grossly underestimate the burdens because they do not measure unique ADRD care-related challenges and
costs. The impact on spouses, partners, children, and even grandchildren are overlooked, leading to the
intergenerational costs of ADRD being ignored, with devastating impact. Therefore, we propose to develop and
validate novel item banks using best-in-the-field, psychometrically advanced, mixed-method approaches to
quantify financial hardship across families, including individuals living with ADRD and their families, partners,
and caregivers. These measures of financial hardship in ADRD will be publicly available to inform researchers
and policymakers about the extent of the burden and any disparities in who is most impacted. Ultimately, new
measurement tools of financial hardship are required to address these disparities and improve quality of life for
individuals living with ADRD, their families, partners, and caregivers, to provide early identification and proper
interventions. Four aims of this study include: 1) identify the experiences of financial hardship for individuals
living with ADRD and their family members, partners, and caregivers using qualitative methods, and develop
pools of items on financial hardship responsive to these experiences; 2) calibrate the item banks using Item
Response Theory and develop efficient, user-friendly measurement tools for use with individuals living with
ADRD, their families, partners, and caregivers; 3) establish reliability and evaluate construct validity of the
developed measures in individuals living with ADRD, their families, partners, and caregivers; and 4) devise an
efficient screening approach from the newly developed measures that identifies people most at risk of financial
hardship and validate it against a well-established set of demographic and socioeconomic variables."
10974892,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major opportunistic pathogen. Due to its metabolic diversity and virulence factor
arsenal, it can colonize almost every facet of the human body. The Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum
sensing system has been shown to be critical for promoting biofilm dispersal and significantly contributes to in
vivo virulence in animal infection models. In comparison, much less is mechanistically understood regarding how
environmental changes in parameters such as pH and oxygenation affect Agr quorum sensing. Unpublished
data from our lab suggests that the RNAIII P3 promoter, directly induced by Agr quorum sensing, is induced in
aerobic cultures containing glucose and remains uninduced during low-O2 growth. Blood hemolysis and
production of phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) were also completely repressed under low-O2 growth. Although
these data suggest that low-O2 growth represses Agr expression and function, the mechanism behind this
regulation is unclear. Furthermore, previously published studies have found that the expression of many
metabolic genes is altered by agr mutation. Based on these observations, our central hypothesis is that Agr
expression and activity have a reciprocal relationship to cellular metabolism, in which perturbation of
either will have a direct impact on the virulence potential of S. aureus. The overall goal of this proposal is
to interrogate the influence of metabolism on Agr function and virulence gene regulation in defined hypoxic and
altered pH environments, and in turn, fully assess the impact of Agr disruption on metabolism. This proposal
seeks to: 1) identify mechanisms by which low-O2 and pH regulate human blood hemolysis by validating and
characterizing mutants from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (NTML) with increased human blood
hemolysis during hypoxic growth and making clean deletion mutants to assess growth, acid production, and
gene expression of Agr under anaerobic and hypoxic conditions; 2) interrogate the influence of metabolism on
Agr function and virulence factor expression to determine how respiratory status affects Agr expression in S.
aureus in both pH adjusted and buffered media under defined O2 partial pressures; and 3) elucidate the
contribution of Agr and oxygenation to S. aureus metabolism using RNA-seq and targeted metabolomics to
monitor the impact of Agr on wildtype and isogenic agr mutants, under defined hypoxic conditions. These data
will allow us to resolve strain-dependent effects on Agr-mediated gene expression in response to hypoxic growth
under defined metabolic states and will address a current gap in our mechanistic understanding of how S. aureus
virulence factor production and its metabolic state cross-regulate through Agr. The data obtained in these studies
will generate further hypotheses for future undergraduate research projects and will serve as an important
springboard for continued undergraduate research opportunities in biomedical research."

The National Cancer Institute estimates ~40% of persons in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at
some point in their lives (https://www.cancer.gov). While 5-year survival rates continue to increase due to
improvements in clinical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports cancer is still the second
leading cause of death in the United States (www.cdc.gov). Innovative measures and larger datasets are
required to continue these improving trends in clinical care(Rahib et al. 2021). The last 15 years of cancer
research has benefited tremendously from the advent of next-generation sequence technologies. Ever present
in this genomics revolution is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For over a decade, TCGA led the way to
molecularly characterize over 10,000 tumors from 33 different cancer types(Ellrott et al. 2018; Ding et al. 2018;
Bailey et al. 2018). From these efforts arose a common theme that all tumors are unique, but many share
prognostic and diagnostic drivers of disease. Among these biomarkers are cancer predisposition or germline
mutations contributing to cancer development(K.-L. Huang et al. 2018). Despite this large effort, TCGA is a case
set heavily biased toward cancer type selection and post-cancer data collection, thus making it difficult to identify
predictive or preventive disease models.
To address this issue, and many others concerning human health, the National Institutes of Health has united to
produce the All of Us Research Program(Ramirez et al. 2022). This phenomenal program currently has over
400,000 participants who have agreed to share their electronic health records (EHR) and genetic
information(Doerr et al. 2021). This number is expected to grow to one million by its conclusion. Participant
selection is disease agnostic, and recruitment has focused on underrepresented minorities, with almost 50% of
participants reporting non-White. Preliminary analysis of the insurance billing codes suggests the All of Us
collection will be a fruitful dataset to study cancer. We found 35% (34,849 of 98,553, version 6 release) have (or
had) reported neoplasms. Furthermore, this 35% makes up ~80% of all billing code occurrences shared in the
electronic health record, again highlighting the All of Us dataset will be a rewarding environment to study cancer.
Here, we propose two ambitious aims run by two teams of undergraduate students that will achieve our overall
objective to characterize and quantify the impact of known predisposition cancer mutations and develop
models for cancer misdiagnosis in the All of Us Research Program. Separated by genotype and
environment, these aims seek to i) identify and assess the genetic intersection of cancer predisposition
databases with the All of Us genomics cohort and ii) discover computational algorithms and features that can
predict cancer misdiagnosis. Collectively, these aims encompass doable tasks for well-trained undergraduates
in bioinformatics. We look forward to advancing the cancer research community beyond tumor-specific
phenotypes by exploring the whole individual to find novel links to comorbidities and cancer triggers to help
elucidate the missing heritability in cancer."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in childhood may cause neurocognitive deficits which worsen over time. Declines in
cognitive function may lead to suboptimal T1D management, resulting in a vicious cycle that increases risk for
poor glycemic control and life-threatening complications. New devices for T1D management such as
automated insulin delivery systems reduce glycemic variability, but optimal use requires advanced
understanding and cognitive functioning. Therefore, understanding how to prevent neurocognitive decline is
critical. Despite the importance of this issue, the mechanisms underlying neural injury caused by T1D are not
well understood. Exposure to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at T1D onset and repeated DKA episodes, chronic
hyperglycemia, and severe hypoglycemia have all been hypothesized to play a role. In the proposed multi-
center study, we will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of children with T1D and a comparison group of
children without diabetes, both from diverse racial, ethnic, and income backgrounds, to characterize
associations between T1D-related factors and neurocognitive outcomes and to identify modifiable mechanisms
and actionable targets for ameliorating cognitive declines. We will enroll 800 children 6 to 11 years-old with
new onset of T1D (half with and half without DKA at onset) and 200 children without T1D. This cohort will be
comprehensively evaluated at enrollment and followed for a minimum of 1.5 years to determine the extent to
which DKA at onset predicts cognitive differences over time (Aim 1), how glycemic variables (mean HbA1c,
time in range, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, frequency of hypoglycemia) predict cognitive
differences over time (Aim 2), and to assess interactive effects of DKA exposure and glycemic variables. We
will also investigate whether DKA and hyperglycemia are associated with changes in serum inflammatory /
neuroinflammatory markers and brain structure via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Aim 3). Participants will
complete a detailed Baseline assessment (3-6 months after T1D diagnosis) and follow up assessments (yearly
after the baseline assessment). Comprehensive panels of inflammatory markers and measures of gene
expression will be used to characterize the inflammatory/neuroinflammatory state over time. MR diffusion
tensor imaging will be used to assess brain microstructure (fractional anisotropy) and MR spectroscopy will
evaluate brain metabolic alterations related to neuronal health and density. Together, these results will provide
information to develop a mechanistic model for T1D-associated brain injury on which to base future
interventional trials. In sum, this project will characterize the impact of DKA and glycemic variables on cognitive
functioning in children with T1D and will provide insights into how these factors may lead to neural injury and
cognitive decline. By identifying risk factors for cognitive deficits, determining optimal glycemic ranges to
prevent declines in cognition, and pinpointing avenues for prevention and intervention, we will gain the
foundation necessary to change clinical practice and improve cognitive function in people with T1D."

For several decades nanoparticle formulations of molecules used for diagnostics and/or therapy have been
intensively developed to improve and control their bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. This is particularly
important for the large number of new drugs developed that have poor solubility in water. A common form of
such formulations consists of small molecules of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) encapsulated in a
polymer nanoparticle carrier. Despite the advantages of this type of nanoparticle formulation for many
materials, there is a lack of predictive quantitative models for determining the optimum method, processing
conditions and excipients needed to effectively encapsulate a given API. Instead, much of the development
and optimization are based on qualitative and/or trial-and-error methods.
This proposal aims to address this by a systematic study of the encapsulation efficiency of small molecules into
polymer nanoparticles using the method of flash nanoprecipitation. This simple method, in which a solution is
rapidly mixed with a second, miscible solvent in which the API has poor solubility, yields nanoparticle
dispersions with sizes in the range of 10’s to 100’s of nanometers. It has several advantages, including ease of
scaleup, the possibility of incorporating multiple components into single particles, and the ability to use the
processing conditions to kinetically trap molecules that might otherwise not be encapsulated.
We propose to develop a general model for predicting the encapsulation efficiency of a given molecule into a
polymer nanoparticle based on the molecular properties of the API, polymer, and solvents and as a function of
the processing conditions such as concentration, mixing rates and temperature. Our model will be based on
both thermodynamics (partitioning of the molecules into the polymer phase due to non-specific van der Waals
interactions) and kinetics (trapping of molecules in the polymer due to the glass transition), as well as the
interplay between the two. The model will be tested using a range of molecules, polymers, and solvents by
measuring encapsulation efficiencies and effects of the small molecule on the particle size and morphology. A
second aim will be to apply this model to the development of various potentially useful systems. Finally, we will
use this project as an opportunity train undergraduate students in highly multidisciplinary research, exposing
students with backgrounds in physics to applications in biomedicine and giving biology or biochemistry
students experience in fundamental materials characterization."

 Over 6 million people in the United States are afflicted by chronic ulcers and this number is expected to
grow. Wound healing is impaired in these patients, who are often inflicted with other diseases (i.e., diabetes,
venous disease, or arterial disease), receiving anti-inflammatory steroid treatment, or receiving chemo- or
radiotherapy for cancer. Chronic ulcers can negatively affect patient quality of life and productivity and are a
substantial financial burden to the health care system. Patients typically require extended periods of
hospitalization and may require over 26 weeks for full recovery. Treatment of diabetic ulcers and related
amputations in the U.S. totaled over $10 billion in 2011. Current treatments of non-infected ulcers are costly
and have demonstrated mixed results. Most importantly, these treatments do not actively prevent infection,
which can often complicate healing and affect long-term stable wound resolution.
 In the current proposal, we seek to manipulate a unique bioinspired redox chemistry found in mussel
adhesive proteins to create a novel, multifunctional nanocomposite adhesive that can potentially promote
wound healing while minimizing infection. There are three main objectives to this proposal. Objective 1:
Prepare novel antimicrobial adhesive and evaluate its performance. Objective 2: Evaluate the adhesive’s
cytocombatibility and its ability to promote healing and prevent infection in culture. Objective 3: Verify
candidate adhesives’ ability to promote healing in an infected wound model in diabetic mice. Future work will
evaluate adhesive’s ability to promote healing in a larger animal model."

Neuroimmune signals regulate neuronal function and survival. We have obtained multiple pieces of evidence
indicating that activation of the heterodimeric interleukin-13 receptor alpha 1/interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-
13Rα1/IL-4Rα) affects the viability of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We found that in the brain, IL-
13Rα1/IL-4Rα is preferentially expressed on the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are lost
in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We also showed that interleukin 13 (IL-13), produced during neuroinflammation by
microglia and neurons, can modulate the activity of dopaminergic cells and increase their susceptibility to
oxidative damage. Thus, having established that activation of IL-13Rα1 signaling can affect the survival of
dopaminergic neurons during neuroinflammation, in the present application we wish to determine the molecular
and cellular mechanisms by which this occurs. Specifically, we wish to test the hypothesis that IL-13 and neuronal
IL-13Rα1 cause damage by stimulating a regulated cell death pathway called ferroptosis. We also wish to
determine to what extent IL-13 and IL-13Rα1 contribute to neurodegeneration in a mouse model of alpha-
synucleinopathy (α-Syn), a hallmark trait of PD that is associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative damage.
This will help us determine whether targeting IL-13Rα1 signaling might be a viable approach to slow
neurodegeneration in humans affected by an α-synucleinopathy such as PD. The ability of ruxolitinib, an FDA-
approved drug that inhibits IL-13Rα1 signaling, and that of the novel ferroptosis inhibitor CMS121 to reduce IL-
13-mediated damage in vivo will also be tested. Finally, we propose in vivo experiments to test the hypothesis
that a rare genetic variant of IL-13 found in individuals diagnosed with early-onset PD can contribute to more
rapid loss of dopaminergic neurons in a mouse with the homologue of this mutation. If successful, these
experiments will provide strong support for the hypothesis that IL-13 and IL-13Rα1 are novel targets for
preventing PD or slowing its progression, at least in a sub-set of PD patients."
10973662,"This project will investigate the neural mechanisms and clinical antecedents underlying listening difficulty (LiD)
in school-age children born very preterm using a prospective cohort design. The long-term goal is to enhance
auditory and language outcomes for at-risk children. The central hypothesis is that extended high-frequency
(EHF) hearing loss stemming from exposures like ototoxic medications disrupts the integration of spatial and
talker cues during competing speech processing, thereby being a mechanism underlying LiD in preterm
children. The project will leverage an existing cohort of over 300 very preterm infants with prospectively
collected perinatal and neonatal clinical data, including audiological, behavioral, and neuroimaging results.
Antecedent factors of LiD and EHF hearing loss will be determined by testing associations between neonatal
clinical variables (e.g., ototoxic medication exposure, abnormal MRI at term, social risk factors) and later
emergence of LiD and EHF hearing loss. Identifying early clinical antecedents will allow targeted monitoring of
high-risk infants and guide neuroprotective management in the NICU to mitigate exposures leading to
impairments. A subset of 115 preterm children and 35 controls aged 6-8 years will undergo questionnaires,
audiological testing (including EHF thresholds), and neuropsychological assessments. EHF hearing loss will be
defined as >20 dB HL from 10-16 kHz. Listening difficulty will be quantified using the Evaluation of Children’s
Listening and Processing Skills (ECLiPS) caregiver questionnaire. A subset of 35 preterm children and 35
controls will also undergo magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a competing speech paradigm manipulating
talker and spatial cues. Neural tracking of the speech envelope will be evaluated using inter-event phase
coherence. The specific aims are: 1) Evaluate neural mechanisms underlying LiD in preterm children and 2)
Determine clinical antecedents of LiD and EHF hearing loss in preterm children. The hypotheses are: 1a) EHF
hearing loss will be associated with greater listening difficulty, 1b) EHF hearing loss will disrupt the integration
of spatial and talker cues as evidenced by reduced synergistic effects on neural speech tracking, 2a)
Antecedents of LiD will include abnormal MRI at term and high social risk status, and 2b) Antecedents of EHF
hearing loss will include ototoxic medication exposure and otitis media history. Linear regression models will
evaluate associations between EHF hearing loss and ECLiPS scores. Mixed effects models will test for
interactions between EHF hearing loss, spatial cues, and talker cues on neural tracking. Clinical antecedents
of EHF hearing loss and LiD will also be determined using regression models. By clarifying the neural
mechanisms and clinical antecedents of LiD in preterm children, this project will lay the groundwork for
developing targeted therapeutic interventions and early identification of high-risk children."

Prior infection with tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly recognized as an important risk factor for chronic
respiratory disease and reduced quality of life. Patients with a history of TB have up to three times the risk of
developing chronic lung disease at a younger age than their counterparts. However, TB programs are focused
on screening and treatment of the acute infectious disease. Despite a good treatment success rate for drug-
susceptible TB, many survivors do not return to full health. It is not known if health workers are aware of the
post-TB morbidity since standard diagnostic criteria for post-TB lung disease applicable to low-income
settings is currently under development. I hypothesize that health workers in our setting are unable to make a
diagnosis of post-TB lung disease due to a non-existent diagnostic tool. The overarching goal for this K43
training grant is to develop and assess the feasibility of a post-TB lung disease diagnostic tool based on history
and physical exam that can be easily deployed in a primary health care setting without access to specialized
diagnostic procedures. The proposed studies and formal educational activities in this proposal will provide
critical research training in three main areas; (a) risk modelling to create and validate a clinical diagnostic
algorithm, (b) qualitative work to determine health workers’ knowledge and attitudes towards diagnosis of post-
TB lung disease, (c) development and feasibility testing of an intervention for post-TB lung disease diagnosis in
a setting with limited diagnostic resources. I will build on an existing cohort of adults who have been declared
cured of TB at a tertiary hospital in Uganda to design and validate a diagnostic algorithm for post-TB lung
disease (Aim 1). I will conduct a qualitative study to identify healthcare provider barriers and facilitators of
diagnosing post-TB lung disease (Aim 2). I will subsequently determine the feasibility and acceptability of using
the post-TB lung disease diagnostic algorithm at a primary health-care facilities in Uganda in a pilot
intervention study (Aim 3). The findings of this proposal will have significant public health impact by improving
the diagnosis of post-TB lung disease in a low-income TB endemic setting. Importantly, I will add to the
growing body of post-TB lung disease literature, with potential generalization to other low-income settings. A
collateral output of this training grant is that I will improve on post-TB lung disease knowledge among
gatekeeper health facilities in our setting. The proposed mixed methods training will be the basis for my
transition to an independent researcher and will provide important preliminary data for a competitive NIH-R01
grant proposal. In the fourth year of this award, I will develop an NIH-R01 protocol to conduct a larger
effectiveness trial, or incorporation into trials of therapeutics for post-TB lung disease and ultimately improve
person-centered post-TB lung disease care quality and outcomes in TB endemic areas."
10974955,"Dendrite regulation by the mitochondrial kinase PINK1: Implications for PD/LBD
PROJECT SUMMARY.
Synaptic loss is a major structural correlate of dementia, and reduced spine density is observed in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the Lewy body dementia (LBD) disease spectrum. Autosomal recessive
mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) and PD with
dementia (PDD), with heterozygous carriers exhibiting cognitive-executive dysfunction and cortical
degeneration in the absence of motor symptoms. Given that wild type PINK1 is reduced in the cortex of
patients with sporadic PDD and AD, we studied the role of endogenous PINK1 in regulating dendritic
branching, spine density and function in the previous project period. We elucidated a novel signaling
pathway by which PINK1 promotes dendritic arborization, discovered that Pink1-/- neurons exhibit reduced
dendritic spine density in vitro and in vivo, and identified a novel PINK1-regulated motor protein
phosphorylation site. In the current proposal, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in dendritic
mitochondrial transport in PINK1-deficient neurons result in defective mitochondrial support of
synaptic plasticity. We will employ molecular genetic manipulations, glutamate uncaging and
electrophysiology to study the impact of PINK1 loss-of-function on dendritic transport of mitochondria,
mitochondrial motor proteins, and perisynaptic mitochondrial positioning in Pink1-/- mouse neurons and
PINK1-mutated patient iPSC-derived cortical neurons. We will also study the impact of PINK1 deficiency on
spine dynamics and cognitive function in Pink1-/- mice in vivo. A better understanding of novel PINK1-
driven mechanisms that promote dendritic health and spine function may yield valuable insights relevant to
neuroprotection for these devastating neurodegenerative diseases."
10975557,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Targeted internal radionuclide therapy is a highly efficacious form of cancer treatment that employs
administered radiopharmaceutical agents to destroy malignant cells. Radiopharmaceutical agents of this type
require a biological targeting vector, which selectively recognizes and binds to receptors that are
overexpressed on cancer cells, and a bifunctional chelating agent, which stably binds to and attaches the
radionuclide to the targeting vector. The radionuclide can be chosen and altered to possess different nuclear
decay properties, potentially rendering it valuable for theranostic applications, as long as its coordination
chemistry is compatible with the bifunctional chelator. Conventionally, beta particle emitters have been
leveraged for therapeutic applications, but recent clinical studies have revealed the efficacious nature of alpha
particle emitters for this application. The use of alpha emitters is hindered, however, by a lack of gamma
photon or positron emissions that can be leveraged for theranostic applications and by their unconventional
coordination chemistries, making it challenging to find a suitable bifunctional chelator. This project will address
both of these challenges in alpha particle emitter targeted internal therapy by designing new bifunctional
chelators that can be simultaneously used with diagnostic gamma- or positron-emitting radionuclides. In
Specific Aim 1, new bifunctional chelators for the established highly promising alpha emitter actinium-225 will
be developed. These chelators will be designed so that they can also effectively accommodate the widely
available imaging radionuclide indium-111. With these new chelators, theranostic agents based on actinium-
225 can be easily accessed. Specific Aim 2 will focus on the short-lived alpha emitters lead-212 and bismuth-
213. To make theranostic agents from these radionuclides, bifunctional chelators that can be easily
functionalized with the versatile positron-imaging radionuclide fluorine-18 will be synthesized. Lastly, in Specific
Aim 3, chelators for the unconventional newly arising radionuclides uranium-230, and vanadium-48 will be
developed. Uranium-230 is a therapeutic alpha emitter and vanadium-48 is a diagnostic positron emitter. We
will explore chelating agents that are mutually compatible for these radiometals to enable their use as a
theranostic pair. Through these three aims, this work will increase the diversity of radionuclides with distinct
half-lives and decay chains that can be used for this application. Furthermore, it will give rise to diagnostic
partners for these therapeutic alpha emitters, which is critically important for predicting patient dosimetry,
disease staging, and response. Collectively, the successful execution of this project will give rise to theranostic
alpha-emitting therapeutic agents that can cure and diagnose human disease."

base of ELSI-interested communities to support the development of CERA resources. Building on over four
years of experience and relationship-building with ELSI-relevant communities, and the knowledge-to-action
(KTA) framework, we will develop innovative processes for content development and facilitate collaboration to
enhance the dissemination, uptake, and translation of ELSI research findings. CERA is a collaboration
between Stanford University, Columbia University and partners at The Hastings Center and Case Western
Reserve University. CERA | ELSIhub will be guided by the principles of responsiveness, inclusion, adaptability,
rigor, transparency, and open access. Our specific aims are to:
Aim 1: Develop and maintain the ELSIhub platform for researchers to share and search for ELSI
 research products
Aim 2: Curate and synthesize ELSI research
Aim 3: Facilitate new collaborations and increase uptake of ELSI research
Over the past four years, we have established a solid foundation for community-building and resource
development, focusing on the ELSI research community. We also conducted a comprehensive accessibility
assessment of ELSIhub and CERA events and implemented a plan to broaden accessibility and develop best
practices for accessibility for the ELSI research community. In the next award period, CERA will expand its
focus on ELSI researchers by establishing new collaborations with genome scientists, ELSI scholars and
trainees in The Hastings Center Sadler Fellows Program and Summer Bioethics Program for
Underrepresented Undergraduates, the Broad Institute, the SING Consortium, Black in Genetics, and other
groups to promote diversity in ELSI research and ELSI-adjacent communities. We will introduce the ELSI
Connect program, an online discussion board called ELSI Exchange, and ELSI Journal Clubs to encourage
collaboration and resource sharing among a wide range of ELSI-interested groups and to crowdsource
identification of high priority areas for CERA events and resources. We will explore innovative methods to
assess the feasibility of responsible and valid AI-assisted curation and synthesis of ELSI research, using large
language models trained on ELSI research products drawn from ELSIhub databases. We will also add an
independent Evaluation Team to design and conduct program evaluation and analyze platform use."
10974904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Epithelial cells form tightly packed sheets of uniformly polarized cells, with an apical membrane
contacting the environment, lateral membranes held together by specialized cell–cell junctions, and basal
membranes anchored to other cells or the extracellular matrix. The establishment of apicobasal polarity in
epithelial cells is coordinated by three highly conserved protein complexes: PAR, Crumbs, and Scribble. These
polarity complexes contain proteins that act as scaffolds to recruit other binding partners, including the Rho
GTPases, to build spatially distinct signaling complexes. A major barrier to understand the formation of the
epithelium is our poor understanding of the mechanisms that control the function of the Scribble complex. For
over two decades, the Scribble complex was known to function as a module from genetic studies, but it was
unclear how the members of the complex interacted with each other, and their link to the regulators of adhesion
and polarity. To close this gap, my lab is focused in defining the precise composition, mechanism of formation
and regulation of the Scribble complex. We have recently shown that SGEF, a RhoG-specific GEF, is a new
component of the Scribble complex that acts as a scaffold to form a ternary complex by interacting directly with
Scribble and Dlg1, and plays a role during junction formation, and E-cadherin stability. Based on these findings,
the objective of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate the function of the
Scribble/SGEF/Dlg1 complex during cell-cell junctions’ assembly, maintenance, and turnover. We will test the
central hypothesis that the Scribble complex targets SGEF to the basolateral membrane where it regulates the
E-cadherin stability and endocytosis in a catalytic dependent manner. We propose the following specific aims to
test this hypothesis. Aim 1. Characterize the spatiotemporal regulation of SGEF-mediated RhoG activation by
the Scribble complex. Here we will test our working hypothesis that binding to Scribble and Dlg1 targets and/or
activates SGEF to cell junctions, which promotes the localized activation of RhoG, which is essential for the
regulation of E-cadherin expression levels; Aim 2. Define the role of the SGEF complex in the regulation of E-
cadherin stability and endocytosis. Our working hypothesis is that SGEF is recruited to the basolateral membrane
through its interaction with Scribble and Dlg1, where it regulates the stability of E-cadherin at the plasma
membrane.
 This approach is innovative, as it provides mechanistic insight on a new function for the Scribble complex.
This contribution will be significant because it will shed light on the fundamental mechanisms controlling cell-cell
adhesion and its role in the establishment of polarity in epithelial cells and tissues. Understanding how cell
adhesion and polarity are established and maintained in normal cells is important for situations in which loss of
adhesion and polarity represent a problem, such as epithelial cancers, which comprise 85% of all human
cancers."

Millions of Americans are at risk of type 2 diabetes, but we lack a precise understanding of mechanisms
causing high blood glucose levels, life-altering complications, and premature death. Current criteria for type 2
diabetes use glucose and HbA1c diagnostic cutoffs based on a link to retinopathy and thus do not account for
risk of other microvascular and macrovascular complications. To improve approaches to defining prediabetes
and diabetes, risk stratification is critical. Recent studies from our group and others demonstrate the potential
to classify patients with early diabetes that may ultimately result in personalized treatment and better
outcomes. Despite the reproducibility within existing subtype definitions, including genetically determined
clusters and new-onset diabetes clusters, there is no unifying theory or strategy for type 2 diabetes
classification, which must integrate different data types. Type 2 diabetes needs to be re-defined so that precise
and accurate diagnosis can be provided to patients, and the appropriate mechanism-guided therapies applied,
to alleviate suffering and prevent complications. We plan to challenge the current paradigm that defines
diabetes and prediabetes based solely on glucose and HbA1c. Our overarching goal is to integrate clinical and
multi-omic data into prediabetes and type 2 diabetes classification and build prediction models of disease
trajectories over the lifespan. Our central hypothesis is that multi-omic data can refine definitions of type 2
diabetes, identify those patients most like to develop complications, and better identify people at risk for future
development of type 2 diabetes. The following three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: We will use multi-omic
data to refine existing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes definitions and define new distinct subtypes of these
conditions. Aim 2: We will describe the associations of diabetes subtypes with microvascular and
macrovascular complications and identify environmental contexts that modify disease trajectories. Aim 3: We
will determine whether subtypes based on high dimensional clinical and multi-omic data in MESA, ARIC,
HCHS/SOL, All of Us and other cohorts from the consortium can be recapitulated using clinical biomarkers.
Our expected outcomes are (1) characterization of more homogenous subgroups of diabetes patients among
US populations of multi-ethnic groups, (2) identification of lifestyle and/or medical interventions that reduce
type 2 diabetes risk or risk of future complications for any given subgroup, and (3) new diagnostic tools that
can be translated to a clinical setting to more accurately classify type 2 diabetes."
10974816,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammation is an essential component of vertebrate immunity against invading pathogens,
foreign insults, or abnormal physiologic conditions. Cellular death programs, meant to eliminate
infected, insulted, or abnormal cells, constitute frontline mechanisms in innate inflammation.
Release of immunogenic cellular materials from dying cells contributes to the initial stages of
inflammation (also called acute inflammation). Even though this process is meant to be
protective, the loss of vital cells from infected/affected organs often results in acute tissue injury.
As infection/insult is mitigated, acute inflammation is resolved with onset of tissue repair
processes. However, if insult/infection continues, acute inflammation is not resolved. The
persistent inflammation continues to injure tissues and subsequently leads to fatal organ
damage. This process manifests in systemic diseases such as sepsis. The challenge remains in
understanding how fundamental drivers of inflammation contribute to protective versus injurious
inflammation. This knowledge is essential to design targeted intervention strategies against
damaging inflammation without impeding protective inflammation. In this proposal, we will
characterize how cellular death programs contribute to both protective and injurious
inflammation in immune and non-immune cells during bacterial infections. We recently show
that cell death-associated proteins, apoptotic caspase (CASP)8, necroptotic receptor interacting
protein kinase (RIPK)3- and CASP8-RIPK3-associating partner RIPK1 dictate endotoxemia,
pulmonary inflammation and sepsis in mice. CASP8 and RIPK3 amplify injurious inflammation
while RIPK1 plays a protective role. These observations highlight that different components of
cell death signaling contribute differentially to pathogen-induced diseases. Based on this
evidence the central hypothesis of this proposal is: Members of cellular death signaling dictate
both beneficial and injurious inflammation during multi-organ injury and must be targeted
accordingly for therapy. In the specific aims of this proposal, we will utilize human cells, murine
genetics, knockdown/knockout strategies to characterize how cell death-associated proteins
contribute during bacteria-induced inflammation. We will also test chemical and new biological
suppressors of cell death as anti-inflammatory strategies in these settings. This proposal is
transformative in its potential to identify novel signaling steps of inflammation as well as future
therapy targets. This proposal also retains a primary focus on training undergraduate students
in research with the aim of preparing next generation of immunology researchers."
10867483,"Thalamocortical networks are critical for basic neural sensory processing and for foundational cognitive
functions such as attention, perception, and working memory. Dysfunction of these networks is thought to
affect symptomology of several neurological disorders and some psychiatric disorders; however, the
dynamics of thalamocortical networks during everyday tasks are poorly understood even in healthy
cognitive function. The thalamus is a complex aggregation of nuclei with distinct roles and connection
patterns. Fundamental questions remain regarding how these many distinct nuclei interact with the
various sensory, motor and association areas in cortex. In particular, the roles of higher-order thalamic
nuclei, each of which projects diffusely across several cortical regions, and the role of the thalamic
reticular nucleus, which inhibits most other thalamic nuclei, remain poorly understood.
In order to clarify the dynamic interactions within thalamocortical networks, this study will measure activity
in all dorsal regions of cortex and in many thalamic nuclei during a variety of sensory discrimination tasks,
similar to those tasks commonly used for studies of cognitive function in health and disease. We will
simulate impairment of several distinct thalamic regions through optogenetic inhibition to elucidate their
roles in comparisons. Next, we will investigate how these dynamic interactions between the thalamic
nuclei and cortical regions develop as animals begin to learn these tasks and as they acquire skilled
performance. A key aspect of our design is that we will carefully monitor spontaneous motions and our
analyses will control for activity in the thalamic nuclei related to these movements, which are often
correlated with cognitive tasks, and would otherwise confound the analyses.
This project will elucidate the roles of the different higher-order thalamic nuclei and of cortical feedback to
these nuclei in gating cognitive processes across several sensory modalities. We expect these findings to
yield many insights about thalamocortical network function during sensory processing, leading to greater
understanding of cognitive function in the animal models used to study neurological and psychiatric
disorders."

Aging is associated with outgrowths of mutated blood stem cells, termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
potential (CHIP). The most frequent lesions in CHIP include mutations in epigenetic factors (DNMT3A, TET2,
ASXL1) and loss of Y chromosome. CHIP associates with increased risk of blood cancers, like acute myeloid
leukemia, but also chronic inflammatory diseases of aging such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The
latter is thought to occur due to altered function of myeloid cells, such as macrophages, derived from the
mutant stem cells. As Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is another disease of aging where myeloid cells, called
microglia, are thought to play major role, it is reasonable to ask if CHIP associates with risk of AD. Surprisingly,
epidemiological surveys revealed that those with CHIP had reduced risk of AD and AD-related neuropathologic
changes in multiple well-characterized cohorts. Remarkably, ~30-90% of microglia in brain samples from
people with CHIP were derived from the mutant clone, indicating replacement of wild-type microglia and the
possibility of a direct effect on brain physiology by these mutant cells. While these studies robustly
demonstrate that CHIP has a protective association with AD, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The
objective of the current research proposal is to understand why those with CHIP are resilient to AD. Our central
hypothesis is that CHIP mutations, in at least some cases, lead to alterations of microglial gene expression
programs and functional activity in a manner that promotes resilience to AD pathophysiology. Our approach is
to execute three complementary aims to test the central hypothesis: 1) to identify driver gene-specific effects
and interaction of CHIP with germline variation on risk of AD in large human cohorts, 2) to assess quantitative
changes in mutant microglial fraction and microglial density in CHIP using archival samples from two brain
banks, and 3) to assess changes in microglial cell state and gene expression associated with CHIP by
performing highly-multiplexed imaging and single-cell genomic assays on human brain samples. The
contribution is significant because it will uncover novel genetic and molecular properties that are altered in
CHIP to prevent AD pathology. Our proposal is innovative because we will a) use data from >500,000 people,
including >20,000 with AD to study the epidemiological association between CHIP and AD, b) perform the first
survey of highly-multiplexed imaging of brain to understand the effect of CHIP on microglia density, regional
variation, and activity in situ, and c) assemble the largest single-cell genomic dataset of brain samples from
CHIP carriers to date to understand alterations in microglial cell state due to CHIP. The expected outcome of
this research is to delineate the genetic and cellular mechanisms that occur in CHIP and CHIP-associated
microglia to lead protection against AD. The long-term impact of this research will be to stimulate the
development of novel therapies for AD that seek to mimic the biological effects of CHIP."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (AD/ADRD) affect a large percentage of population in the US creating
a signficant health care burnden to society. A few environmental stressors have been identified as risk factors
for ADRD, including lead (Pb). Exposure to these chemicals particularly during vulnerable developmental periods
can result in adverse neurological outcomes later in life, including ADRD. However, less is known about the
genetic risk factors that act as confounding factors with Pb contributing to ADRD onset. Furthermore, Pb
exposure can affect aging hallmarks, while aging is a well-established risk factor for ADRD. Hence, it is crucial
to understand how developmental Pb exposure interacts with aging hallmarks, ultimately influencing the
biological “age” of the CNS and its repercussions. The goal of the proposed work is to identify and validate Pb-
interacting genetic risk factors contributing to the etiology of ADRD in “age”-matched human neuronal models.
Our preliminary studies verified the presence of ADRD pathogenic marks in 2D neuronal culture with
developmental Pb exposure; and demonstrated the feasibility of using human mouse chimeric brain to provide
the proper extracellular environment for neuron aging. Novel engineering platform to enable neuronal sorting
based on the formation of tau aggregation; and track changes in age-related epigenetic features were also
demonstrated which collectively form a strong technical foundation for our two research aims. In SA1, we will
idenitfy genetic risk factors coupled with developmental Pb exposure that contribute to ADRD etiology. To do
that, we will establish and validate reporter plamsids for ADRD pathogensis; screen for genentic risk factors in
2D culture models for Pb-coupling genetic risk factors; and validate select genetic targets in human neuronal
models (2D/chimera). In SA2, we will characterize changes in aging hallmakers after Pb exposure and
recaptiulate “aging” features in 2D culture. To do that, we will characterize the effects of Pb exposure on the
installation of aging hallmarks in human mouse chimeric model and 2D culture focusing on nucleus,
mitochondrion and mitochodnrial-nuclear signaling. The collective knowledge will guide the design of an “age”
accelerating mixture that can facilitate neuronal maturation and degeneration in 2D cultures. Upon completion,
we will develop an enabling platform for identification of GxE interactions intricated by developmental Pb
exposure in aging brains; and verify our central hypothesis that Pb influences the development of ADRD by
intertwining its effects with other genetic risk factors and the aging process."

The uterine circulation and placenta are specifically designed to regulate the flow of blood and transport of es-
sential nutrients to the fetus. Disruption of maternal hemodynamic regulation during pregnancy can adversely
impact fetal health, resulting in miscarriage and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current treatment op-
tions for IUGR patients are extremely limited, focusing primarily on early delivery; thus, putting the mother and
child at risk for complications associated with preterm birth. Epidemiological studies indicate that pregnant
women exposed to fine particulate matter (PM) have a heightened risk of fetal loss and development of IUGR.
We have reproduced this phenomenon in laboratory rodent models, wherein animals exposed to nanosized
titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) aerosols develop IUGR and suffer a greater number of ‘miscarriages’ (fetal
reabsorptions). We have demonstrated that acute and chronic exposures significantly impair uterine vascular
endothelium-dependent dilation, severely limiting maternal-to-fetal blood flow and impacting fetal growth. An
understanding of the mechanisms underlying dysregulation in uterine and placental blood flow is critical for
developing treatments and reducing IUGR. Based on previous findings, we hypothesize that maternal
inhalation of nano-TiO2 aerosols during pregnancy promotes the development of IUGR by disrupting
endothelium-dependent NO and AA signaling cascades, resulting in reduced uterine vasodilation and
blood flow. Moreover, folic acid (FA) supplementation will rescue this utero-placental hemodynamic
imbalance and prevent IUGR through its action in NO signaling. Using novel approaches and methodolo-
gies, these studies will: (1) evaluate uterine nitric oxide-driven vasodilation, (2) determine whether alterations in
arachidonic acid metabolism impair uterine vascular reactivity and impact placental perfusion, and (3) assess
the therapeutic benefit of dietary folic acid supplementation to improve utero-placental blood flow and attenuate
the development of IUGR after maternal exposure to nano-TiO2 aerosols. These studies are conceptually
innovative as we will utilize our unique resources to identify mechanistic targets within the utero-placental mi-
crocirculation and test directed nutritional interventions for IUGR. This work is technically innovative as we will
use novel methodologies developed for the evaluation of environmental toxicity in maternal-fetal medicine.
Overall, the successful completion of these studies will: (1) create the conceptual framework to identify
environmental exposure as a risk factor for the development of IUGR; (2) reveal new mechanistic insight into
the vascular pathogenesis resulting from nanomaterial exposure; (3) provide a molecular basis to identify how
nanomaterial exposure manifests as vascular disruptions; and (4) identify mechanistic targets for therapeutic
strategies to ameliorate microvascular dysfunction and improve utero-placental blood flow. These intervention-
al strategies are not only limited to PM, but are widely applicable to understanding the role of a spectrum of
environmental toxicants in the pathophysiological development of IUGR."

“Our Healing Journey: A Cultural and Traditional Response to the Opioid Epidemic”
Generally, there are greater negative consequences associated with substance misuse among American
Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, even when rates of substance use abstinence are higher across the
two groups (i.e., alcohol). Substance use rates among AI/AN adults compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW)
vary. Due to ongoing settler-colonialism, health inequities related to substance use on the applicant reservation
persist. Opioid poisoning on the reservation has increased by 159% from 68 (2019) to 176 and the reservation
has the highest naloxone administration rate in the state, 193.4 per 100,000 people compared with 84.7 per
100,000 people. Locally focused strategies have been identified and implemented to address and alleviate the
impact of the opioid and methamphetamine epidemic on the reservation. At the applicant outpatient treatment
facility, community-focused, culturally grounded, evidence-based, and innovative solutions rooted in the
teachings of the Medicine Wheel have been implemented. The Medicine Wheel is a holistic framework
representing the spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional domains necessary to living a balanced and healthy
life. It signifies the balance in the four directions, the four seasons, and the stages of life, along with
representing the relationship to self, family, community, the environment, and land, as well as the larger
societal context. Therefore, we propose to respond to the public health crisis by building up our research
infrastructure and skills and expanding our culturally centered response by employing community-driven
strategies. Together, our team has the culturally grounded program development, evaluation, and research
experience necessary to complete the activities outlined in the proposal. The proposed aims will follow the
Medicine Wheel teachings and incorporate emotional, physical, mental and spiritual focus areas. The specific
aims include: 1) Mental—Develop the infrastructure to track individual and community outcomes related to this
proposal, including poisonings, treatment seeking, treatment retention, and well-being. 2) Emotional, Physical,
Spiritual—Refine the proposed integration of the EHR, evidence-based practices, cultural, and CAM
evaluations, by assessing community interest in these interventions, identifying barriers to implementation, and
creating a comprehensive model and supporting documents for implementation, and determine outcomes for
analysis. 3) Emotional, Physical, Mental, Spiritual—Pilot our intervention and study the feasibility of our
approach and collect preliminary data for a larger study to examine and measure the menu of strategies and
solutions (e.g., traditional plant medicines, CAM, harm reduction strategies) to address outcomes including but
not limited to anxiety, depression, sleep, substance use and abstinence, fatal and non-fatal drug poisonings,
engagement and retention, pain management, overall feelings of well-being. No previous research has
investigated the combination of traditional Indigenous medicines, CAM, harm reduction, and Western
evidence-based strategies on substance use, pain management, and well-being among AI/AN communities.
Building our research infrastructure by partnering with the NRRN and other T/NASOs, along with the activities
described in the proposal, will allow us to develop a research portfolio and collect the pilot data for the
submission of future NIH research proposals that prioritizes culture, well-being and is strength-based. Our work
will make a national impact by adding to the research on the rapid response necessary to inform long-term
research and services for other rural Tribal communities, many of whom are bearing a disproportionate burden
of the opioid epidemic."
10907842,"With nearly 6 million cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosed in the United
States in 2019, the health and well-being of ADRD caregivers is of critical importance. Promoting the health
and well-being of ADRD caregivers is an effective way to support these unpaid staples of ADRD care.
Although interventions targeting ADRD caregivers continues to accelerate, little attention has been paid to
caregivers’ use of supportive services, which remains strikingly low. The objective of this K99/R00 application
is to enable Dr. Falzarano to develop the necessary expertise to design, implement, and evaluate studies
focused on leveraging technology to support and address ADRD caregivers’ multifarious needs. In the K99
phase, Dr. Falzarano will work toward achieving five training objectives that will prepare her to transition to
become an independent investigator who designs and evaluates evidence-based technologies to enhance
tailored caregiver support. First, she will extend her knowledge in substantive areas including dementia
caregiving and front-end and back-end software development. Second, she will learn how to develop,
implement, and test behavioral interventions with an emphasis on collaboration with community partners.
Third, she will receive training in statistical methods to examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
effectiveness in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Fourth, she will learn about measurement development
and psychometric validation of assessments for ADRD caregivers. Fifth, Dr. Falzarano will pursue professional
development activities, particularly in the areas of grant writing, leadership, and integration of research and
web development teams. The four proposed research aims were chosen to complement the areas identified for
career development. Aim 1a will provide the requisite training and experiences to provide Dr. Falzarano with
the critical skills needed to conduct the proposed study. Aim 1b will include interviews with ADRD caregivers to
identify needs, awareness of, barriers to, and willingness to use services. Aim 1c will leverage key stakeholder
(dementia-care experts) input to identify existing services corresponding to areas of need identified in Aim 1b.
Aim 2 will leverage data collected from caregivers and stakeholders to inform the iterative development and
design of the Caregiver Resource Room (CRR) website, which will include a digital self-assessment tool using
machine learning models to identify and categorize needs and provide an output of targeted service
recommendations. Aim 3 will include an analysis of the tool’s content, design, features, and services output,
which will be iteratively refined based on ADRD caregiver feedback. A randomized controlled trial will be
conducted in Aim 4 to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the CRR as a tool to
enhance awareness of and access to relevant services to address unmet needs and improve mental health.
The proposed research is well-aligned with the NIA’s strategic initiative to foster the development of research
scientists in aging and to develop and test promising interventions to improve ADRD caregiver outcomes."
10977461,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding the causes and mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm disruptions that are associated with
fatigue during cancer treatment remains unclear. This current deficiency means that successful cancer treat-
ment falls short of its potential and prior quality-of-life remains elusive for patients. Our long-term goal is to im-
prove debilitating behavioral sequelae in cancer patients, thus improving quality-of-life, other comorbidities,
and mortality. Thus, the overall objective here is to establish the potential role of circadian disruption as a fun-
damental pathway by which chemotherapy promotes cancer-associated fatigue. Indeed, robust circadian rhyth-
micity of virtually all physiology is extremely well-conserved; desynchrony of these rhythms leads to negative
health and behavioral consequences. The central hypothesis is that chemotherapy-induced inflammation inhib-
its SCN function leading to fatigue. The rationale for this work is that circadian circuitry disruption is an under-
studied, relevant pathway in psycho-oncology research that could elucidate mechanisms and new, rhythm-fo-
cused interventions. Three specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis using our novel breast
cancer “survivor” mouse model. Aim 1 will determine the ability of the master clock to entrain after chemother-
apy. Behavioral SCN rhythm adaptations to environmental challenges will be assessed. Aim 2 will identify the
role of central inflammation in master clock disruptions after chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy-induced
neuroinflammation on SCN molecular and behavioral rhythms will be quantified. The potential resolution of fa-
tigue will also be assessed. Aim 3 will determine the role of circadian disruption in chemotherapy-induced fa-
tigue. Genetic and pharmacological SCN timing manipulations will precede a battery of behavioral assess-
ments of the physical, motivation, and cognitive components of fatigue. In vivo and ex vivo circadian timing ap-
proaches combined with systems-, cellular-, and molecular-level analyses will pinpoint the effects of two regi-
mens of chemotherapy on master oscillator circadian circuitry relevant to cancer-related behavioral comorbidi-
ties. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because using circadian approaches is new to psycho-
oncology. It is also technically innovative by way of the superior translational model and the circadian genetic
and pharmacological techniques planned. This research will result in essential new knowledge about how com-
mon cancer treatments affect the pacemaker, which is crucial to extensive downstream physiology and behav-
ior (i.e., beyond fatigue). Results will provide much needed evidence to make circadian-based approaches
standard in clinical practice, as well as inform the design of novel circadian-directed pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions. This research is applicable to other cancers and in non-oncological populations
treated with chemotherapy (e.g., stem cell transplant, lupus)."
10975485,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Single-cell genomic studies have transformed our understanding of the cellular
organization and plasticity of the human lung, providing substantial insights into molecular pathways active in
end-stage lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis (PF), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and others. A
common theme emerging across these studies is that there is a profound loss of highly specialized cells and
cellular phenotypes in advanced lung diseases. The critical signals responsible for tissue organization and
cellular specialization during lung development occur in three-dimensional space, and spatial context is critical
to understand the intercellular communication mechanisms, and relationships among different cell types and
states that establish and maintain distal lung “niche specialization”. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that perturbations of cell-cell signaling in the alveolar niche lead to loss of cellular specialization,
and disease-specific programs of progressive pathologic remodeling in PF, BPD and other chronic lung
diseases. The goal of this LungMAP3.0 Research Center is to identify key molecular targets at the early stage
of disease most amenable to stabilization or reversal. Our specific aims are to: 1) Develop a spatially-resolved
molecular atlas of chronic parenchymal lung diseases, 2) Define mechanisms of niche dysregulation that result
in the progressive histopathologic patterns of chronic lung diseases across the lifespan and 3) Investigate the
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms through which niche-perturbations promote and prevent disease
progression. We have assembled a team of investigators with a strong history of productive collaboration who
offer expertise in chronic lung diseases that manifest across the lifetime and share a deep commitment to rapid
and transparent data sharing in support of the lung biology community. We are excited to partner with other
LungMAP Research Centers, the Data Coordinating Center and Human Tissue Core as we leverage state-of-
the-art single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches that enable interrogation of archival samples from
highly unique cohorts of early-stage lung disease as we investigate the molecular origins of alveolar niche
dysregulation in IPF, other forms of interstitial lung disease, and BPD."
10975588,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the United States (US) with an estimated prevalence of
5 million and is expected to increase to 12 million by 2030. AF poses a substantial public health burden in the
US with an estimated annual cost of $6 billion. AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure,
cardiovascular mortality, and significantly impairs quality of life in most patients.
 Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation remains the
cornerstone treatment in symptomatic AF patients. The long-term recurrence of AF with anti-arrhythmic agents
remains unacceptably high and moreover, their safety profile is suboptimal as they have a narrow therapeutic
window. While catheter ablation is more effective in restoring sinus rhythm, the recurrence rates following
ablation still ranges from 30% to 50% in persistent AF, often leading to a second procedure.
 AF is a progressive disease with many patients progressing from paroxysmal AF to persistent AF and
eventually longstanding persistent AF leading to permanent AF. Whilst this observation was initially considered
to be part of the arrhythmic process, recent data suggest that the likelihood of progression to more persistent
forms of AF, are determined by uncontrolled cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, diabetes mellitus
(DM), metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse and hypertension. Recently, several studies have reported positive
impact of cardiometabolic risk factor modification with incident AF (primary prevention), but fewer studies have
examined the relationship with the burden of AF in patients with pre-existing AF (secondary prevention).
 These findings suggest that a new paradigm for AF management (primary and secondary prevention) should
include a new pillar targeting lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factors. There have been significant recent
advances in the development of cardiometabolic drugs, which are FDA-approved to treat metabolic conditions
such as obesity and DM. There is a critical need to investigate the clinical effectiveness of management of
cardiometabolic risk factors with new cardiometabolic drugs including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor
Agonists (GLP1-RA) and Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i) in secondary prevention of AF.
 Accordingly, we aim to we perform comparative effectiveness research investigating the role of new
cardiometabolic agents including GLP-1RA, SGLT2i and repurposing potential of metformin alongside bariatric
surgery in reduction of AF burden. We will be using the Veteran Affairs nationwide electronic healthcare records
(VA-EHR) which provides a unique opportunity to perform CER of AF at the population level due to the availability
of long term follow data (> 600,000 AF patients with ~7 years of follow up) with minimal missingness in follow
up. The results from this R21 are likely to yield substantive new insights into the role of cardiometabolic agents
and bariatric surgery in the reducing the burden AF and provide hypothesis generating findings which may
eventually lead to the design of new pragmatic clinical trials in secondary prevention of AF."
10975731,"Project Summary/Abstract
 To treat wounds that won’t heal for patients with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa,
we have developed induced pluripotent cell (iPS)-cell derived cGMP compatible, scaleable induced skin
composite (iSC) differentiation system that requires multi-lineage interaction to generate graftable
surface ectoderm (SE), mesoderm/dermis and melanocytes. Work from ARO73170, now in its 5th year,
endeavors to fill gaps in knowledge about the chromatin dynamics and interactions between the
lineages to enhance manufacturing efficacy and reduce line-to-line variability. ARO73170 identified
transcription factors (TFs) TFAP2 and GRHL2 that pattern early SE differentiation. In addition GATA3
and the product of the Xia-Gibbs Syndrome locus Gibbin induce Gibbin-dependent mesoderm (GDM)
that matures the SE stratification program through cross-regulatory signaling. For SE differentiation,
GRHL2 activity is required for TFAP2A chromatin binding and in turn, TFAP2A restricts inappropriate
GRHL2 binding to ectodermal disease-associated loci, but the mechanism of interaction, and how
network signaling modifies its output, remains a gap in knowledge. For GDM differentiation, we found
that wild type GDM can rescue mutant ectoderm, reinforcing the need to identity the cross-regulatory
stratification factors that enhance the graftability of manufactured tissue. While GATA3 binding sites are
known, a gap in knowledge exists how Gibbin accumulates on key developmentally regulated promoters
to activate them. Overall our preliminary data supports the intriguing hypothesis that TFAP2-GRHL2
ectoderm signaling, with reciprocal GATA3-Gibbin-GDM induction and signaling, allows proper iPS-
derived graftable tissue manufacturing. We will focus on key gaps in knowledge as we dissect spatial
and temporal TFAP2/GRHL2-mediated surface ectodermal commitment by dissecting the ectoderm-
mesoderm lineage commitment trajectory, refining spatial constraints to optimize surface
ectoderm/mesoderm commitment, interrogating GRHL2-TFAP2 mutual regulatory interactions, and
modulating the GRHL2-TFAP2 target gene network to improve ectoderm commitment; and by
elucidating GDM functions during skin differentiation through elucidating how Gibbin localizes to
promoters of key developmental regulators, dissecting Gibbin-Dependent mesoderm signaling during
mouse ectodermal development, and validating GDM-dependent factors during iPS-derived skin
manufacturing. Successful completion of this proposal will provide deep mechanistic insights into the
chromatin dynamics of multi-lineage tissue differentiation, highlight candidate in-process biomarkers for
clinical manufacturing of skin, and establish a flexible manufacturing platform for novel cell therapy for a
previously untreatable diseases."
10977386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SRC Family Kinases (SFKs) are a group of 9 non-receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate the effects of many
extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. While these proteins have often been considered to be
functionally similar to SRC, the founding member of the family, it is now clear that they have non-redundant and
unique activities. In cancer, these proteins are differentially expressed and their roles can even be antagonistic.
This project launches from our discovery that one of these family members, YES1, is selectively overexpressed
in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), is associated with poor outcomes, and is necessary for sustained
growth of TNBC cells. TNBC is a collection of highly aggressive diseases with limited therapeutic options
primarily involving cytotoxic chemotherapy. While many patients initially respond to these treatments, resistance
is common, resulting in poor patient outcomes. Thus, identifying vulnerabilities in this group of diseases is
essential to yield approaches for improving survivorship. We propose that YES1 is one of these vulnerabilities.
In preliminary data, we show that YES1 is essential for maintaining expression of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) as well as ensuring mitotic fidelity. EGFR is a major driver of TNBC growth. When YES1 is
depleted, EGFR is degraded and its signaling is lost. In addition, we report that YES1 silencing causes several
nuclear defects including micro-, multi-, and dysmorphic nuclei indicating that YES1 is essential for accurate
completion of mitosis. We hypothesize that these two functions of YES1 are essential for cellular viability in
TNBC. Moreover, we propose that YES1 may be a useful therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of drugs
targeting EGFR and mitosis. In Aim 1, we will determine how YES1 controls EGFR degradation and assess
whether YES1 overexpression underlies resistance to EGFR inhibitors in TNBC. Aim 2 will focus on identifying
specific events in mitosis that are impacted by YES1 and the mechanisms involved. It will also discern whether
modulating YES1 can impact response to taxanes, mainstay chemotherapies for TNBC. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
determine if EGFR and YES1 participate in a feedforward loop that controls mitosis. This will involve interrogating
the role of EGFR in mediating the effects of YES1 on mitosis and determining if EGFR is also an upstream
regulator of YES1. Major innovations of this project include the identification of YES1 as a new oncogenic driver
of TNBC, the discovery that YES1 and EGFR may control the genomic complexity that is associated with this
disease, the therapeutic assessment of a novel inhibitor of YES1 in PDX models of TNBC, and the potential for
improving the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors and taxanes in a disease that requires new therapeutic approaches to
improve patient outcomes."
10977387,"ABSTRACT. Approximately 42% of the U.S. adult population is obese and data suggests that persons with
obesity are at a 30% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, efficacious approaches to
preventing and treating obesity will have significant effects on CRC incidence in the U.S. Although calorie
restriction through lifestyle intervention is the most common approach to treat obesity, clinically meaningful
weight loss is difficult to achieve via this method due to low adherence with calorie monitoring, indicating a need
for innovation. Time-restricted eating, a type of intermittent fasting, has been shown in animals to impart cancer
protective effects including lower body weight, decreased systemic inflammation, and improved glucose
metabolism. Time-restricted eating is where individuals are asked to consume all their food for the day within a
specified time frame, and water fast for the remaining hours of the day. We recently performed two short-term
(≤12-weeks) pilot studies of time-restricted eating to evaluate its safety and preliminary efficacy on body weight
and chronic disease risk markers in adults with obesity. Our results show the intervention is a safe and
acceptable approach to weight loss among obese adults. Moreover, time-restricted eating produced
approximately 3% weight loss from baseline and reductions in systolic blood pressure, oxidative stress and
insulin resistance. Although these pilot findings show promise for time-restricted eating as an effective tool for
CRC risk reduction among obese individuals, these data still require confirmation by a well powered longer-term
clinical trial. The present proposal aims to implement a 12-month (6-month active weight loss phase, 6-month
maintenance phase), controlled, parallel arm trial among 255 obese adults (45-65 years old) who are at elevated
CRC risk. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1) Time-restricted eating (weight loss phase: daily ad
libitum food intake from 11am – 7pm), 2) Calorie restriction (weight loss phase: daily 25% calorie restriction), or
3) Control (daily ad libitum food intake, no meal timing restrictions) to compare the effects on: (1) Body weight,
body composition, and intervention adherence; (2) Circulating metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress-
related biomarkers; (3) Colonic mucosal gene expression profiles and mucosal inflammation, DNA damage and
cellular growth; and (4) maintenance of benefits on body weight/composition and systemic/mucosal CRC risk
markers. This proposal will be led by a transdisciplinary team with expertise in nutrition science, time-restricted
eating, behavioral science, molecular markers of cancer, gastroenterology, and biostatistics. If the aims of this
proposal are achieved, it will show for the first time that time-restricted eating can be implemented as a novel
alternative to traditional dieting (i.e., daily calorie restriction) for weight control and CRC risk reduction in adults
with obesity. The proposed study will also be the first and most comprehensive examination of molecular
mechanisms that mediate the anticancer effects of time-restricted eating and calorie restriction."
10977388,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Cancer survivors have unique healthcare needs including risk for serious late effects,
ongoing surveillance, lifestyle modifications to reduce second cancer risk, and psychosocial support. Nearly
70% are considered “complex cancer survivors” because they have at least one comorbid chronic condition in
addition to cancer. Comorbidities pose significant challenges to the delivery of quality cancer care because they
adversely affect and are affected by cancer treatment. Medically underserved patients have the highest burden
of multiple chronic conditions and are at increased risk for poor outcomes during and after cancer treatment. As
medically underserved complex cancer patients may lack healthcare knowledge and access to supportive care,
their health outcomes and care transitions might be improved by enhancing communication and collaboration
between their oncologists and primary care providers (PCPs). This study tests and evaluates a novel shared
care model for complex cancer survivors called OPTIMISE (Oncology-Primary Care Partnership to Improve
Comprehensive Survivorship Care) in the largest safety-net healthcare system in Houston, TX. Three-hundred
newly diagnosed breast, GI, and hematological cancer patients who are being treated with curative intent and
who have comorbidities requiring ongoing management during cancer treatment will complete baseline surveys
and be randomized to either OPTIMISE or Usual Medical Care (UMC). Patients receiving UMC will receive their
cancer treatment, as directed by their oncologist, a survivorship care plan (SCP) at the end of active treatment,
and surveillance visits with their oncologist based on national guidelines. Patients in OPTIMISE will 1) have an
oncology nurse navigator assigned to their care team at diagnosis to facilitate oncologist-PCP communication
and continuity of care; 2) receive coordinated care between their oncologist and PCP throughout cancer
treatment and surveillance facilitated by a structured communication and referral process; 3) receive a
survivorship care plan (SCP) at the end of treatment that incorporates comorbidity management; and, 4) receive
a risk-stratified shared care model of post-treatment surveillance where one or more routine oncologist follow-
up visits is replaced by a PCP visit. AIM 1 evaluates the impact of OPTIMISE on patient chronic disease self-
management (primary outcome) and quality of life (secondary outcome). Aim 2 explores the effects of OPTIMISE
on healthcare use and patient unmet needs during and after active cancer treatment. Aim 3 examines the effects
of OPTIMISE on oncologist and PCP attitudes and coordination of care. Aim 4 seeks to elucidate patient- and
system-level factors that may influence implementation outcomes. OPTIMISE shifts the timing of thinking about
survivorship to point of diagnosis and seeks to develop a clinical infrastructure to support continuity of care from
cancer diagnosis through post-treatment survivorship. If found effective, OPTIMISE could be expanded to other
cancers, igniting a potentially rich area of research. It may also have significant downstream impact in other
medical settings by enhancing care transitions from specialty to primary care."
10974881,"Project Summary/Abstract
The broad, long-term goals of the proposed research are to better understand the neural
underpinnings of healthy motor function and motor dysfunction in Rett syndrome and to promote
undergraduate involvement in health-related research. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological
disorder, caused by disrupted function of the gene MeCP2, typically resulting in severe cognitive
and motor disability. What goes wrong in the motor signals sent from the brain to the body,
leading to motor dysfunction in RTT, remains largely unknown. Based on our recent work in
rodent models, together with the fact that seizures are prevalent in RTT, here we hypothesize
that excessive synchrony among neurons in the motor system may disrupt motor coding by
limiting the dimensionality of motor signals. The essential idea here is that extreme synchrony
entails many neurons doing the same thing, which precludes the complexity of signals required
for controlling complex body movements. A complete and quantitative understanding of this
idea is best approached using the framework of high-dimensional geometry. In this framework,
excessive synchrony causes a collapse of the motor coding subspace, which is likely to
entangle signals and collapse the complexity of body movements. The proposed work has
three promising potential outcomes. First, we leverage state-of-the-art ideas from high-
dimensional geometry of population motor coding to advance RTT etiology. Second, we
provide an important counter-example of what can go wrong when high-dimensional geometry
is disrupted, thus advancing basic knowledge of motor systems neuroscience. Third, we will
test new RTT treatment strategies with potential for future translation from lab to clinic. Our first
specific aim is to determine how MeCP2 dysfunction alters population coding in motor cortex
and striatum. We hypothesize that excessive synchrony will result in reduced dimensionality of
the population motor code, which manifests as motor dysfunction. Our second specific aim is to
test two promising treatment strategies, one pharmacological, and one based on physical
therapy. We hypothesize that these treatments will partially recover wild-type dimensionality of
motor coding. To test these hypotheses, the proposed research would use high-density multi-
electrode measurements to monitor the spiking activity of many single neurons in motor cortex
and striatum of head-fixed mice as the animal runs on a computer controlled wheel. The
research will be performed by a team of three undergraduate students and one postdoc. The
proposed work would build upon the success of another recent R15 grant which resulted in a
PNAS publication including an undergraduate author."
10974880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While approximately 85% of Black women report being screened for Cervical Cancer (CC) compared with
about 83% of White women, Black women have a higher incidence of cervical cancer, are more likely to
present with progressed stage CC, and have a higher rate of mortality from CC, in fact, Black women are 80%
more likely to die from CC than White women. Yet, only two evidence-based interventions in the Evidence-
Based Cancer Program Registry have been designed specifically for Black women. These interventions were
developed in the 1990s, and they do not address the diversity in ethnicity and culture among Black women,
including African American women (AAW) and Black African Immigrant women (BAIW). These populations
have differences in knowledge, awareness, and behaviors related to cervical cancer screening that are
important to consider in creating effecting interventions for these women. To create interventions that respond
to cultural diversity among Black women, and meet the specific needs of AAW and BAIW, we need to
understand the unique differences in multilevel determinants (beyond knowledge and behaviors) of cervical
cancer screening among BAIW and AAW. Our long-term goal is to develop a publicly available, evidence-
based CC intervention for BW with components targeted specifically for BAIW and AAW. In our previous work
with BW and CC screening, we focused on disaggregating differences in behavioral determinants, such as the
knowledge and attitudes of BAIW versus AAW. In this proposed study, we will expand this focus to examine
entrenched structural barriers and socioeconomic factors that influence routine CC screening and follow-up,
and perpetuate CC health disparities for both BAIW and AAW. Our specific aims include to (1) identify
multilevel determinants of routine CC screening and follow-up adherence (Colposcopy) among BAIW
and AAW, (2) Aim 2: Co-design components of a multi-level intervention to promote CC screening and
follow-up adherence (Colposcopy) among BAIW and AAW., and (3) evaluate intervention component
preferences among BAIW and AAW to refine the intervention. To accomplish these aims, we will use an
innovative, community-engaged, student- intensive approach through focus groups and survey. This proposed
project will uncover the multilevel factors that influence CC screening and follow-up among BAIW and AAW
and help to fill a significant gap in knowledge and clinical practice regarding various determinants of CC
screening and follow-up in these populations. This project will support the development of a multilevel
intervention plan that contains a core educational component that is relevant to BW and 2 subcomponents that
are specifically relevant to AAW and BAIW. This project will also inform a report that summarizes our
intervention design and describes best practices for public health professionals, which could be used by the
National Cancer Institute."
10975515,"American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) face some of the highest rates of substance use disorders and related mortality in the nation. AIAN may also face a host of mental health and substance use issues related to multigenerational exposure to historical trauma, personal trauma, poverty, and unemployment. Concomitantly, despite the effects of AIAN health disparities and social inequities, tribal communities have retained their language, culture, and community connectedness, which offer unique and important strengths that have yet to be fully integrated in tribal research efforts. The University of Washington Seven Directions (UW-7D) team proposes to partner with Drs. Melissa Walls (Professor, Johns Hopkins University Center of Indigenous Health (JHU-CIH) to provide a four-pronged approach to provide GATHER: Growing a Tribal Healing Effort through Research, designed to support N CREW funded research teams for the purpose of ensuring health equity within AIAN communities using a strengths-based, culturally grounded approach to grow tribal research in the areas of overdose, substance use, mental health, and pain research. 
The University of Washington Seven Directions (UW-7D) team will serve as the core support (Prong 1), supporting the documentation and monitoring of tribal research grants, along with building the initial relationships with tribal and other Native American Serving Organizations (NASO) research teams to develop trust, identify research capacity needs, readiness to engage in research and enhance research capacity of T/NSAO. In our technical assistance work, we recognize the importance of authentic relationship building, and this will inform our approach to working closely with T/NSAO research teams (Prong 2 – Technical Assistance Approach). JHU-CIH will provide the research support core (Prong 3), drawing from a wealth of experience and expertise to support the technical research capacity development and/or data enhancement capacity of T/NSAO grantees. They will provide training in grant writing, specific aims development, identification of study designs and measures, and data access and quality improvement. UW-7D and JHU-CIH will both serve as the translation and communication core (Prong 4), supporting the dissemination of opportunities, trainings on translating research findings to program content and other implementation materials, and supporting the annual convenings of T/NSAO research teams. 
GATHER’s purpose is to substantively contribute towards building research capacity among and provide instrumental research support to tribally led overdose, substance use, mental health, and pain research projects towards the improvement of the health and wellbeing of AIAN populations through fostering and growing Indigenized approaches to substance use research. The GATHER initiative aims to: 
1) Conduct, stimulate, coordinate, and support collaborative research on the etiology and prevention of harmful alcohol use and related risks in the transition to adulthood, within an overarching developmental 
framework emphasizing social, cognitive, contextual, personality/temperament, and affective influences. 
2) Provide the necessary administrative support and shared resources to facilitate the successful 
completion of component research projects contributing to the Central Theme. 
3) Provide an administrative infrastructure, intellectual environment, and access to resources and initial support for young investigators and those new to the field of alcohol etiology and prevention. 
4) Provide clinical and research training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in the areas of cognitive, motivational, and behavior therapies targeting prevention and treatment of alcohol use and related risks. 
5) Serve as a local, national, and international resource for dissemination of information and training to the public, trainees, and academic audiences, to foster the application of new knowledge to the reduction of harmful alcohol use and related risks in diverse EA populations. 
Benefits to AIAN Communities: This innovative multimethod approach will have important methodological, prevention, treatment, and environmental impact among AIAN communities, because it will a) offer key research supports for tribally-grounded substance use research; b) address research capacity needs at the individual, team, and community levels; c) provide groundwork to for a holistic, culturally informed research training and TA approach, and d) refine the methods of effective CBPR in tribal and NASO settings. Given the disproportionate effect of substance use, mental health issues, and lack of clinical capacity to effectively support pain management, and the far-reaching dissemination plan developed by the GATHER partnership, this innovative initiative has the potential for wide range impact among the funded and yet-to-be-funded N CREW research projects and across Indian Country in general.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the opioid crisis and overdose epidemic, including opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder.

10974071,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adult stem cells constitute a group of progenitor cells capable of tissue regeneration during life through the ability
to both self-renewal and produce specialized cells upon division. In tissues, stem cells reside in
microenvironments called “niches” that integrate systemic cues and provide signals for stem cell maintenance.
With age, a decline in both stem and niche cell maintenance has been observed. Over the years, the use of the
stem cell systems present in Drosophila melanogaster has revealed mechanisms behind the loss of stem cell
function in age. For instance, aged flies have a smaller number of male germline stem cells, as well as niche
(hub) cells. Recent evidence, however, points to a strong conserved correlation between age-related changes
in metabolism and stem cell dysfunction. Given the power of Drosophila genetics, the readily accessible
molecular tools, the well-characterized stem and niche cell populations and the relatively short lifespan, the fly
testis niche is an ideal model for the intersectional study of metabolism, aging and stem cell biology. Our long-
term goal is to understand how changes in lipid metabolism affect stem cell niche homeostasis. The PI’s
published works build a model where the ectopic accumulation of lipids in the fly testis niche is detrimental to
stem cell function. Excess lipid accumulation in stem cells led to their loss through differentiation. Accordingly,
lipid accumulation has been shown to be detrimental to stem cell maintenance across species. The overall
objective of this proposal is to understand mechanistically how the stem cell niche is affected by the age-related
ectopic accumulation of lipids. Preliminary data in this proposal shows that lipid droplets accumulate specifically
in niche (hub) cells of the fly testis. Moreover, we also describe the activation of pathways involved in lipid
accumulation (Target of Rapamycin, TOR and Sterol regulatory element binding protein, SREBP) in niche cells.
Of note, both environmental and genetic manipulations that result in the activation of SREBP led to niche cell
loss through the unexpected conversion into stem cells. Hence, our central hypothesis is that the age-related
ectopic activation of TOR and SREBP contribute to lipid accumulation and loss of niche cell maintenance and
function. We will test this hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) testing if suppressing the age-related ectopic
activation of TOR and SREBP in niche (hub) cells is sufficient to prevent the decay in niche cell maintenance
and function; 2) characterizing the mechanism of SREBP-mediated hub cell loss. The merit of this study relies
on its novelty – showing that changes in lipid metabolism can promote the conversion from a niche cell into a
stem cell – and on the generation of a useful paradigm for testing how age-related changes in metabolism yield
in loss of stem cell niches. The proposed studies will also strengthen the undergraduate student research
environment at the University of Louisville, as the experiments are designed to be conducted by undergraduate
research assistants in the laboratory."
10974201,"Metabolic syndrome and diabetes are pandemic in modern society. Humans with increased an
elevated body burden of certain lipophilic xenobiotics such as dioxins are at increased risk for
type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These anthropogenic substances exert their effects
through activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Results under the previous award
present a compelling argument that disruption of circadian rhythmicity, particularly
desynchronization of the central clock from those in metabolically important organs, occurs
subsequent to long-term AhR activation, in a sex-specific manner. Metabolic syndrome
develops in mice that have a disrupted circadian clock, and diabetic mice display marked
alterations in circadian rhythms. Chronic AhR activation causes a similar disruption in rhythms in
liver and adipose tissue. This proposal thus seeks to alleviate AhR-induced metabolic
dysfunction using a treatment that involves bolstering circadian clock function. Previous findings
also demonstrate that AhR regulation of adipose tissue is more important in females, and that
female adipose tissue has significant impact in regulating systemic glucose metabolism. We
hypothesize that restricted feeding can regulate can restore depleted rhythms in adipose
tissue function and rescue metabolism from the detrimental effects of chronic AhR
activation. Further we hypothesize that estrogen/AhR interactions underlie adipose
regulation of systemic metabolism in females. The proposal combines approaches that
examine systemic metabolic parameters and behavioral circadian rhythms and molecular
studies that focus on mechanisms of AhR/estrogen interactions. Specific aim I explores
restricted feeding as a mechanism to reset clock function after its ablation by chronic AhR
activation. Aim II explores molecular mechanisms of AhR interactions with estrogen signaling
specifically in female adipose tissue. The project provides a framework for training
undergraduate, graduate and medical students in preparation for careers in the biomedical
sciences. The proposal highlights a novel mechanism for xenobiotic action in the
development of metabolic syndrome, explores a biological basis for sex-specific
therapeutics, and provides insight into the potential for chronotherapy as a treatment for
diabetes and metabolic syndrome."
10974202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases worldwide and is a leading contributor to
comorbidities and early mortality. Current prevention and treatment strategies are not optimal for all individuals
due to heterogeneity in the etiology and pathophysiology of T2D. Indeed, substantial variation exists across
individuals in the relative contribution of insulin resistance vs. beta cell function to T2D development and
progression, as reflected by differences in glucose regulation among persons with comparable glycemia at
diagnosis. Recent research has applied clustering algorithms to identify subgroups of diabetic individuals with
varying clinical profiles, risk of diabetes complications, and responsiveness to treatment therapies based on
clinical variables measured at diagnosis (e.g., body mass index, age, fasting glucose and insulin, hemoglobin
A1c, diabetes autoantibodies). Most of these studies leveraged large registry-based European cohorts, which
boast large sample sizes but lack diversity and/or data on social determinants of health that are known to drive
chronic disease risk in the U.S. Moreover, most subtyping methods that have been applied require subjects to
be placed in fixed categories which may not reflect the racial/ethnic and sociodemographic diversity of U.S.
populations and may not be ideally suited to accommodate mixed data types (e.g., clinical, omics, behavioral,
environmental, social). Such multimodal data provide an untapped opportunity for subtyping based on realistic
multi-level drivers of heterogeneity in the clinical course of T2D, from prediabetes to complications and
comorbidities. In response to RFA-DK-23-020, we seek to establish the Subtyping Core for Research on the
Etiology of Type 2 Diabetes (SCORE-T2D) at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Partnering
with the Consortium, SCORE-T2D will lead innovative analytic activities and provide crucial resources for the
Consortium Cohort Sites through methodological expertise in subtyping algorithms, data harmonization across
large datasets, single and multi-omics analyses, lifecourse epidemiology, and integration of social factors;
content expertise in T2D etiology and pathophysiology; and programmatic experience in multi-site study
coordination and analyses. Our overarching objective is to work with the Cohort Sites and NIDDK to employ
multi-level, multi-dimensional approaches to characterizing heterogeneity in T2D in the Consortium. We will
accomplish this through 1) developing and implementing consensus protocols for data sharing, management,
harmonization, and analysis; 2) characterizing subtypes of T2D and identify underlying social and physiologic
drivers of the etiology and clinical course for each subtype; and 3) coordinating Consortium logistics on results
sharing, outreach, and dissemination. SCORE-T2D at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus will
bring a fresh perspective on multi-site coordination and biostatistical expertise by spearheading efforts to quantify
and understand heterogeneity in the risk factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, manifestations, and
consequences of T2D."
10915714,"Bullying is the most common form of youth abuse world-wide and is linked to profound, lasting, deleterious effects to psychological, social, academic and health functioning. The cascading effects of bullying costs the US billions of dollars annually, and current interventions produce only modest improvements. A recent bullying intervention targeting altered reward processes, specifically a preference for relative rewards (e.g. those earned at the expense of others) shows promise. However, how trajectories of bullying relate to altered reward processing, and how perpetrators process relative rewards in comparison to absolute rewards (e.g. money or points earned) is currently unknown. Explicating the biobehavioral reward mechanisms contributing to bully perpetration may allow for the design and implementation of more biologically-informed, empirically-supported interventions that can provide greater reductions in bullying. The goal of this R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to explore how bullying relates to altered reward processes, with a specific focus on how bully perpetration relates to preferences for absolute versus relative rewards. A primary focus of the R00 award will be focused on conducting bullying research translatable to intervention programming, by working with students, local schools, and community partners involved in youth violence and maltreatment services. During the K99, I received mentorship in hierarchical modelling youth behaviors, designing fMRI tasks for youth that assay specific mechanisms, and leveraging findings from research into feasible interventions with broad crosslevel (youth, parent, school, agency) buy-in. The K99 clarified the role of specific risk factors for bully perpetration, how bully perpetration related to absolute reward responses, and included the successful piloting of both a behavioral and neuroimaging task which differentiated the preference and processing of absolute versus relative rewards. The training and results from the K99 now allow for the successful completion of the R00 proposal, which tests how bullying behaviors during childhood and adolescence relate to the preference for relative vs. absolute rewards in a larger, well-phenotyped sample. I will test whether bullying predicts increased behavioral preference and neural response to relative vs. absolute rewards, while assessing for specificity. Results will clarify reward processing alterations related to bullying, examine the specificity of these associations compared to other phenotypes, and examine relative reward preference as an explanatory factor of bullying in relation to other theoretical risk factors. The data collected during the R00 proposal will clarify reward mechanisms underlying bully perpetration and set the stage for a future R01 focused on the neurodevelopment of relative reward preferences, the stability of different reward preferences, and their malleability to intervention. This proposal addresses important concerns about bullying, a mission core to the NICHD mission, and provides foundational data needed to continue advancing the applicant’s academic career and apply for future grants."
10975064,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Despite decades of traditional interventions targeting diet and physical activity, childhood obesity remains a
pervasive and intractable public health problem. It is therefore imperative to prioritize discovery of novel,
modifiable risk factors to prevent obesity beginning in early life. Environmental exposures during critical
developmental windows, especially the prenatal period, may contribute to obesity development by altering
infant physiology and metabolism. Among these potential environmental obesogens, phthalates are one class
of endocrine-disrupting chemicals with ubiquitous exposure in the population. Phthalates may promote obesity
through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, alteration of adipocyte formation and function, and interference
with metabolic pathways. Prenatal exposure to phthalates has been associated with greater childhood body
mass index (BMI) in some studies, but others have reported null or inverse associations. Importantly,
methodological limitations, small sample sizes, and homogenous study populations of these prior
investigations make it difficult to reconcile apparent discrepancies, limit our capacity to determine the most
potent metabolites, and preclude identification of critical windows of vulnerability. Furthermore, no strategies
have been identified to mitigate potential obesogenic effects of prenatal phthalate exposure. Oxidative stress
and associated inflammation are proposed pathways linking phthalates to obesity. Therefore, dietary patterns
that reduce oxidative stress, such as those rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, may be an impactful
intervention target during pregnancy. The proposed research will utilize the rich longitudinal data from the
Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program, a consortium of 69 pediatric cohorts
from across the United States. The proposed project aims to examine the association between prenatal
phthalate exposure and BMI z-score and overweight/obesity risk in children 2-5 years of age (Aim 1a) and
explore prenatal critical windows of phthalate exposure on childhood BMI z-score (Aim 1b). As a solution-
oriented approach, we will also evaluate how diets closely matching the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Aim
2a) and those rich in fish consumption (Aim 2b) may modify the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with
early childhood overweight/obesity. Our team's combined expertise extends across multiple domains critical to
the success of this project. Dissertation committee members serving as key personnel bring substantial
expertise in statistical methods, ECHO structure and organization, nutrition, childhood growth, and the effects
of phthalate exposure on childhood health. Successful completion of this research will help set the stage for
the development of strategies to mitigate the potential obesogenic effects of phthalate exposure in vulnerable
populations. Given that childhood obesity tracks into adulthood, utilizing ECHO to address these aims will
enhance the health of children for generations to come."

 Chemical synapses are composed of paired pre- and post-synaptic terminals. Most of the excitatory
synapses reside on dendritic spines, a type of dendritic protrusion that hosts neurotransmitter receptors and
other postsynaptic specializations. Synapses are plastic and undergo short- and long-term modifications
during developmental refinement of neuronal circuitry, as well as during learning and memory. Synaptic
modifications involve both pre- and post-synaptic changes. At the postsynaptic site, directed trafficking of
neurotransmitter receptors to and from the membrane surface is believed to be a key event underlying long-
term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), respectively. In addition, dendritic spines undergo rapid
changes in their morphology during plasticity. The underlying cellular mechanisms that control and regulate
these rapid changes in postsynaptic receptors and spine structures remain to be fully elucidated. The
cytoskeleton controls many, if not all, aspects of the motility of cellular structures. How the cytoskeleton
regulates postsynaptic structure, function, and modifications during plasticity, however, remains poorly
understood. This proposed study aims to investigate novel actin mechanisms that enable the development of
postsynaptic structure and specialization required for a functional synapse. Specifically, we will investigate
how actin crosslinking, (+) capping, and dynamic G-actin regulation work in concert to enable the elaboration
and maturation of dendritic spines as well as to regulate their remodeling during synaptic plasticity.
Furthermore, the study will a novel interaction between (+) end capping protein CP and Shank scaffolding
protein in coupling the actin-based structural changes and the development of the postsynaptic specialization.
Given that many neural disorders are associated with alterations in synaptic connections and plasticity, we
hope to gain a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity,
which is of importance to our understanding of brain development and functions under both physiological and
pathological conditions."
10980498,"Adaptation to hypoxia is crucial for human pathogens like Candida glabrata, since the condition 
mimics the infection environment inside the host. Hence, our long-term goal is to identify 
essential factors that are required for C. glabrata hypoxic growth, and to exploit them for novel 
Candida drug development. However, the transcriptional responses of C. glabrata shifting from 
normoxic respiratory to hypoxic metabolism is unexplored. My recent work has indicated that 
the transcription factor Upc2A is activated hypoxically, and its function is essential for C. 
glabrata hypoxic growth. Although Upc2A roles in C. glabrata drug resistance mechanism is well 
characterized, its intrinsic function in C. glabrata biology remains under-studied. This application 
takes an interdisciplinary approach combining cutting-edge next generation sequencing, 
proteomics, and molecular genetic techniques to determine the fundamental function of Upc2A 
in C. glabrata hypoxic physiology. Our overall objectives are (i) to decode the comprehensive 
interaction networks of Upc2A target genes as well as genes that are required for C. glabrata 
hypoxic adaptation, and (ii) to identify Upc2A-associated proteins required for the activity of this 
transcription factor and the organism’s hypoxic growth. This knowledge will provide more 
understanding about C. glabrata physiology under hypoxic growth conditions which could 
ultimately be translated into the pathogenesis of this organism inside the host."
10975231,"The overall aim of this application is to better understand the pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and its
contribution to the development of type 2 diabetes. Insulin and glucagon are the most important
glucoregulatory hormones. There is evidence that both α-cells and β-cells (which secrete glucagon and insulin,
respectively) can directly regulate (stimulate or inhibit) each other. In addition, both hormone systems alter
glucose concentrations through effects on endogenous glucose production (EGP). Through these actions,
insulin can indirectly affect glucagon secretion and vice versa. Dysfunction of these regulatory networks leads
to prediabetes and, subsequently, to type 2 diabetes. However, the relative importance of these abnormalities,
and how they interact to differentially affect fasting vs. postprandial glucose tolerance remains unknown.
There is also controversy as to whether minute to minute variation in insulin secretion can control glucagon
secretion and whether these pulse characteristics can serve as biomarkers of islet function. In this series of
experiments, we will examine how glucagon directly, and indirectly through insulin, affects glucose metabolism.
Conversely, we will examine how insulin directly, and indirectly through glucagon, alters glucose metabolism.
Subsequently, we will use our novel methodology to measure islet hormone pulse characteristics to identify
early defects in islet cell function. The proposed experiments will help elucidate the mechanisms by which
fasting hyperglycemia develops in different subtypes of prediabetes thereby providing opportunities to
individualize intervention. In addition, we will develop new methods to quantify fasting islet function and identify
new biomarkers allowing early prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes."

 Urinary incontinence (UI) and symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) become more prevalent with age.
The impact on elderly and their caregivers makes it difficult to continue at-home care, and UI is a top reason
for institutionalizing the elderly. More than half of nursing home residents have UI and over ¾ of those with
dementia have UI. The current application proposes to develop new formulations of drugs that are instilled into
the bladder and produce long-term relief of symptoms (> 3 months) in patients who are refractory to current
therapies.
 This project dovetails nicely with the PI’s basic science doctoral and post-doctoral studies of “somatic
nociception” and pain. Our drugs block nociceptor terminals in bladder that are responsible for causing UI and
OAB symptoms, i.e. “visceral nociception”. Thus, Dignify and the PI provide valuable complementary
perspectives and insight into control of nociceptors. As described in the Research Approach, the scientific
rationale for our drugs’ ability to block nociceptors, and for the formulation proposed to deliver drugs directly to
the drug target inside the bladder (i.e. intravesical), are strongly supported by both basic science and clinical
literature. Intravesical delivery should maximize efficacy at the target and minimize plasma concentrations of
the drugs, keeping side-effects, metabolism issues, and drug-drug interactions to a minimum.
 Aim 1 creates novel formulations for the drugs tested in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 provides rapid screening of
new formulations of the drugs in acute, in vivo, proof-of-concept, dose-ranging studies in anesthetized rats.
Drug formulations that produce positive results in Aim 2 are then studied across 4 weeks in Aim 3 to determine
duration of therapeutic effects after a single pre-treatment with drug formulations. Protocols for determining
blockade of visceral nociceptors in the bladder are standard cystometrogram methods used in Dignify’s
laboratory for decades, and the results are straight-forward changes in bladder pressures that are induced by
nociceptive stimuli, and the blockade of those changes by our novel therapy. Rigorous analyses, inclusion of
positive and negative internal controls, and other techniques are part of Dignify’s routine for ensuring
reproducible results and confident conclusions. Mastering these in vivo methods and analyses of bladder
nociception will allow the PI to expand into various other bladder, bowel, and sexual conditions that present
symptoms of visceral nociception, as well as an opportunity to become an expert in general CNS and
peripheral neuronal control of sacral pelvic viscera in the elderly under supervision of Dignify mentors.
 Assuming positive results, an SBIR Phase 2 application will be submitted to select a lead candidate and
refine the formulation to maximize efficacy and minimize systemic absorption (if any). Subsequently, IND-
enabling studies will begin with the lead candidate to allow clinical study, in which the PI will play a major role.
In addition, the PI is expected to be involved in Dignify’s 2 other IND-enabling projects that are currently funded
by the NIH and DoD."

Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder in the United States, and ~40% of affected
individuals do not respond to existing treatments. A limited knowledge of the neural circuits modulating anxiety
impedes innovation for new therapeutic strategies. Recent sequencing data highlight the diversity of neuronal
cell types in the brain, but a key challenge is determining how different cell types function in behaviorally
relevant contexts. The answer to this question is important because many genetically defined cell types are
evolutionarily conserved across humans, primates, and rodents. One way to link cell types to behavior is with
activity-dependent tagging. The first methods (TRAP, tetTag) used the expression of immediate early genes to
label neurons that are active in specific behavioral contexts. These systems were revolutionary, but the
temporal resolution of these methods is limited (hours) while behavior can occur over minutes. The Fast Light
and Calcium-Regulated Expression (FLiCRE) system combines light- and calcium-dependent tagging methods
to label cells that are activated during a discrete timepoint (~10 min), when a behavior of interest is expressed.
We will use the FLiCRE system to tag cells in brain regions that modulate social approach (nucleus
accumbens, NAc) and avoidance behaviors (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, BNST). We will genetically
define these cells using single cell RNAseq and then functionally define them using optogenetic manipulations.
We will use FLiCRE to tag cells in the BNST of mice exhibiting social avoidance and use single nucleus RNA
sequencing (snRNAseq) to genetically define these cells to test the hypothesis that a subset of Oxtr cell types
are active in stressful social contexts. Pharmacological activation of oxytocin receptors in the BNST is
necessary and sufficient for drive social avoidance. We will then use optogenetics to functionally define these
cells. We predict that inhibition of BNST cells tagged during social avoidance will increase social approach.
Next, we will use FLiCRE to tag cells in the NAc of mice exhibiting social approach. We will use snRNAseq to
test the hypothesis that Oxtr interneurons are active during social approach, because oxytocin receptors in the
NAc promote social approach. We will then use optogenetics to inhibit these cells and predict that inhibition will
decrease social approach. Our research team is ideally suited to execute these studies. Dr. Trainor's lab
delineated oxytocin receptor-dependent pathways of social approach and avoidance. Dr. Kim developed the
FLiCRE construct and used it to identify a novel cell type in NAc that drives aversion. Dr. Tollkuhn is a
molecular biologist and expert on using single nucleus RNAsequencing in brain. Dr. Wiltgen has successfully
performed optogenetic manipulations of neurons labeled via activity-dependent tagging. Our analyses will
identify cell types that modulate social approach and avoidance behaviors, which could lead to novel insights
into how to selectively target these cells."
10975114,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cancer progression is heavily influenced by supportive cells in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages,
an important component of tissue microenvironment, play important roles in both physiological and pathological
processes. Macrophages that infiltrate into tumor tissues are regarded as tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) or leukemia-associate macrophages (LAMs) in leukemia. Although a connection between LAMs and
hematologic malignancies has long been appreciated, the molecular mechanism by which LAMs promote
leukemogenesis is far less understood.
 We have employed Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder associated with bone marrow failure and
progression to pre-leukemic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), to study DNA
damage-immune responses. Using the DNA damage-induced pre-leukemic mouse model deficient for the major
FA gene Fanca (Fanca-/-) and the oncogenic MLL-AF9 AML model, we recently demonstrated that persistent
DNA damage- and oncogenic stress-induced immune receptor TREM1 (CD354) promoted leukemia progression
in mice. Compelling evidence suggests important pathological roles for TREM1 in various types of cancers,
mainly linking to its upregulation and orchestrating inflammatory responses in TAMs. However, how TREM1
functions in leukemic microenvironment remains unclear. To exploit this, we generated a conditional Trem1
mouse model, with which we deleted the Trem1 gene specifically in macrophages using the LysM-Cre deleter
strain. We found that macrophage-specific deletion of Trem1 markedly limited the expansion of Fanca-/- pre-
leukemic HSCs and MLL-AF9 leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in Fanca-/- pre-leukemic and MLL-AF9 leukemia mice.
More recently, we generated an inducible macrophage-specific Trem1-KO mouse model (Trem1fl/flCsf1r-iCre),
and found that tamoxifen induction-mediated LAM-specific deletion of Trem1 altered the gene signatures of M1
and M2 macrophages and skewed macrophage polarization toward the M1-like status in both Fanca-/- and MLL-
AF9 leukemia models. Stage-specific deletion of Trem1 significantly reduced PD-L1 expression in LAMs in these
leukemia mice. We also found that TREM1+LAMs are required for stimulating the migration and expansion of
LSCs in both Fanca-/- and MLL-AF9 leukemia models. Finally, TREM1+LAMs from AML patients were found to
promote the engraftment of leukemic cells in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. These preliminary studies
establish a potential link between TREM1-positive LAMs and leukemia development. We hypothesize that
TREM1-driven interactions between leukemia-associated macrophages and leukemia stem cells
promote the development of leukemia. The goals of our study are to 1) examine the role of TREM1 within
LAMs in leukemia development and to 2) investigate the functional interplays between TREM1+LAMs and LSCs."

Federated learning has emerged as a promising technique in biomedical research, providing the potential
to construct robust common machine learning models with datasets from multiple institutions without having
to share data among groups. However, the current implementations of this technique present several
challenges that must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in the field of biomedicine. These
challenges include issues related to bias and data heterogeneity, privacy and security, and interoperability
among institutions. To mitigate these challenges, it is essential to integrate domain-specific knowledge with
the theoretical advances in computer science and statistics for bias correction and privacy preservation. In
this regard, we propose new mathematical and algorithmic approaches that can make federated learning a
practical reality in biomedical research. These methods include developing domain-specific add-on
algorithms to traditional federated learning frameworks, and leveraging techniques such as optimal
transport and secure multiparty computation to overcome statistical and algorithmic bias, and privacy
concerns. To this end, we will first develop a framework to calculate optimal transport cost of the data
distributions across sites. This cost will be used to determine whether addition of a site to the federated
learning is beneficial to the resulting model. We will then use this cost during the learning process as a
regularization in order to take into account different data distributions in the resulting model. We will also
use the metadata from the sites in the federated averaging process to avoid bias in the resulting model.
Lastly, we will develop federated data pre-processing frameworks using secure multiparty computation to
overcome the privacy issues."

Food insecurity, defined by the United Nations as inconsistent access to a sufficient quantity of affordable,
nutritious food, is a prevalent social determinant of health (SDOH) among safety-net primary care patients.
Among adults with food insecurity, conditions like hypertension (hypertension) and type 2 diabetes (type 2
diabetes) are as much as two times more prevalent. Widely available chronic disease self-management
education and support (SMES) programs place much emphasis on nutrition education but do not significantly
address access to affordable, nutritious food or meals. Notably, simulations have shown that medically-tailored
meals for food-insecure adults could be as cost-effective as some commonly prescribed medications.
Drawing upon our knowledge of systems engineering and user-centered design, our team created and
successfully piloted a novel, dietitian-led sociotechnical intervention called Food Resources & Kitchen Skills
(FoRKS). Safety-net primary care patient-participants (N=20 across two pilots) received essential home
cooking tools, home delivered lower sodium, lower-carbohydrate Mediterranean-style meals and ingredients,
and twice- weekly hands-on home cooking classes. Mean attendance was 87% and mean satisfaction was
4.7/5.0 for delivered foods and 4.9/5.0 for hands-on cooking class. Webex videoconference classes allowed
participants to learn and cook together in a socially supportive “space” from their own home kitchen.
We proposed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate FoRKS versus enhanced usual care (EUC). Safety-net
primary care patients aged 35 years or over with food insecurity and systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm Hg
(~40% will also have type 2 diabetes) will be invited, consented, assessed, and randomized. EUC consists of
SDOH screening, referrals to food pantries, and assistance enrolling in food programs (e.g., SNAP). EUC also
consists of our CDC-approved 5-week SMES program. Those randomized to FoRKS will, in addition to EUC,
receive home-delivered meals and ingredient kits, and twice-weekly Webex cooking classes to week 16. In
week 17, participants will transition from FoRKS-delivered foods to shopping for affordable, nutritious foods.
FoRKS classes will continue in order to maintain learning and social support that may be critical to longer-term
engagement and self-efficacy for obtaining and preparing nutritious food.
The primary hypothesis is that, relative to EUC, FoRKS participants will experience lower mean systolic blood
pressure immediately post-intervention (16 weeks post-baseline). Maintenance to 24-weeks post-baseline will
also be assessed. Food security, nutrition, and HbA1c will also be evaluated as will cost-effectiveness and
behavioral mechanisms such as learning engagement, self-efficacy, and food resource management skills."
10977367,"The inability to clinically treat tumor metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer patient
deaths. Cell migration is a pivotal step in the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells from a primary tumor to
distant organs in the body. Cell motility is governed by cell-matrix interactions, the actomyosin cytoskeleton, and
cell volume regulation via the involvement of ion transporters, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), as
explained by the Osmotic Engine Model (OEM). The roles of cytoskeleton and ion transporters in cell locomotion
have been typically studied in isolation. The overarching goal of this project is to employ a multidisciplinary
approach involving state-of-the-art bioengineering and imaging tools, quantitative analysis and in vivo models to
define the relative roles and potential crosstalk between ion transporters and the cytoskeleton in breast cancer
cell migration and metastasis in vivo. This application will test the hypothesis, supported by intriguing preliminary
data, that the coordinated action of local isosmotic swelling at the leading edge and shrinkage at the trailing edge
mediated by NHE1 and SWELL1, respectively, supports migration in confinement. We further hypothesize that
NHE1 and SWELL1 act in concert with cell cytoskeleton to mediate efficient migration and metastasis. Given the
lack of targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we will prioritize TNBC cell lines and patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells as models. In Aim 1, we will establish the functional roles of NHE1 and
SWELL1 in cell migration inside confining µ-channels of different stiffnesses, in 3D gels and in cell dissemination
from 3D breast cancer cell organoids. We will also elucidate the mechanism responsible for the polarized
distribution of NHE1 and SWELL1 at the cell front and rear, respectively, and use novel optogenetic tools to alter
their spatial polarization and test how these alterations affect the direction and efficiency of cell migration. In
parallel, we will develop an innovative mathematical model to identify the key variables that enable OEM-
mediated cell motility. In Aim 2, we will delineate the interplay between OEM and the various cytoskeletal
constituents, including b1 integrins, myosin II, actin and microtubules. Importantly, we will define the intracellular
transport mechanisms responsible for NHE1 and SWELL1 shuttling along the longitudinal cell surface. We will
also introduce a comprehensive mathematical model to decipher the crosstalk of OEM and cytoskeletal
components in regulating migration efficiency. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the effects of NHE1 and SWELL1
silencing on cell migration in natural mammary tissue tracks in vivo and examine their roles in breast cancer
growth and metastasis, using TNBC cell lines and PDXs orthotopically transplanted to the 4th mammary fat pad
of mice. We will complement mouse studies with experiments in zebrafish, which enables us to image its entire
vasculature at exceptional optical clarity, in order to delineate the roles of ion transporters in different steps of
the metastatic cascade. This application brings together a team of investigators with expertise in bioengineering,
imaging, cell & molecular biology, quantitative analysis, PDXs, in vivo studies and breast cancer biology."

Correction of genetic muscle diseases, such as the muscular dystrophies, is a unique problem due to the
distribution of muscle throughout the body in inaccessible locations. Current clinical trials for Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, involve gene therapy strategies that utilize AAV
serotypes to deliver micro-Dystrophin (µDys). While AAV gene therapies are promising, use of lentiviruses that
have some desirable characteristics are not considered for skeletal muscle gene therapy. AAVs contain protein
capsids that mediate entry into cells, in contrast to lentiviruses that have a membrane envelope derived from
budding off from host cells. Enveloped viruses utilize membrane fusion to enter cells, which is mediated by
fusogenic proteins that form a complex between membranes to drive rearrangements needed for fusion. Skeletal
muscle development also requires membrane fusion events between progenitor cells to form multinucleated
myofibers. Myomaker and Myomerger are muscle-specific cell fusogens, but do not structurally or functionally
resemble classical viral fusogens. We tested if the muscle fusogens could functionally substitute for viral
fusogens, despite their structural distinctiveness, and fuse viruses to cells. We used a pseudotyping platform, a
general process where envelope proteins are altered to change the tropism of the virus, to engineer Myomaker
and Myomerger on the membrane of lentiviruses. We found that these muscle fusogenic lentiviruses leads to
specific transduction of skeletal muscle and that locally and systemically injected virions can deliver micro-
Dystrophin (µDys) to skeletal muscle of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and alleviate
pathology. In addition to lentiviruses, extracellular vesicles are another type of membrane vehicle being
considered for gene therapies. Extracellular vesicles are a heterogenous group of membrane particles released
from most cell types and can contain factors important for homing and entry. We have also uncovered a system
where Myomaker and Myomerger are present on extracellular vesicles and these vehicles exhibit delivery of
material to muscle cells. We will explore these novel membrane vehicles that harness the intrinsic properties of
myogenic membranes. Specifically, we propose to: 1) identify an optimal dosing strategy for lentiviruses
pseudotyped with Myomaker and Myomerger 2) characterize these novel lentiviruses and molecularly dissect
their fusion mechanism with muscle cells 3) develop extracellular vesicles engineered with Myomaker and
Myomerger that target skeletal muscle. Successful completion of these studies will provide unique insight into
these novel vectors specific for skeletal muscle, which have the potential to complement limitations of current
viral-based gene therapies."

The hematopoietic tree contains cells of varying sizes, functions, and proliferation kinetics, and each cell type
has a tightly regulated number of ribosomes. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms the majority of ribosome mass,
and is the most abundant cellular RNA, but rRNA/rDNA are often ignored in high-throughput studies due to a
lack of suitable bioinformatic tools. In this proposal, we ask fundamental questions about rRNA regulation in
human hematopoiesis by re-mapping existing datasets to custom genome assemblies generated by our lab.
rDNA alleles are present in 200-600 repeat copies, and a subset is transcribed by Pol I into nascent rRNA.
Transcription of rRNA is the rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis, and shows >10-fold variation across
hematopoietic cell types. The mechanisms controlling this variation are understudied, and even though every
high-throughput library contains rRNA/rDNA reads, standard mapping algorithms discard these reads.
We recently generated custom genomes for rDNA mapping by masking rDNA fragments from human/mouse
assemblies and adding a single ~45-kb reference rDNA sequence as a new “chromosome R”. We used this
approach to map an atlas of hematopoietic transcription factor (TF)-rDNA binding encompassing ~2200
ChIP-Seq tracks for ~250 factors. We identified that the myeloid TF CEBPA binds rDNA and promotes rRNA
transcription. Our overarching model is that rRNA is regulated across hematopoiesis through a combination of
differential rDNA repeat activation and regulation by lineage-specific TFs. We will interrogate this model
through novel analyses of existing and publicly-available human datasets.
Specific Aim 1: We will quantify dynamics of rDNA copy activation in human hematopoiesis as follows: (A)
Since inactive rDNA copies are heavily methylated, we will map whole genome bisulfite sequencing datasets to
our custom genome to quantify rDNA methylation dynamics in the trajectory from HSCs to myeloid cells. (B)
Since active rDNA copies show broad MNase-accessibility, we will use ATAC-Seq datasets to quantify changes
in rDNA accessibility from HSCs to myeloid cells. Impact: Determining whether rDNA repeats are differentially
activated at key transitions will guide studies on whether modulating rDNA methylation affects cell fate.
Specific Aim 2: We will identify regulators of rRNA levels in human HSPCs as follows: (A) We will map HSPC
single-cell (sc) RNA-Seq datasets to our custom genome to quantify 18S, 28S levels in addition to the broader
transcriptome. We will assess whether rDNA-binding TFs, chromatin factors, or signatures of HSC quiescence
correlate with rRNA levels. (B) We will map data from a Perturb-Seq study that combined CRISPR-interference
screen with scRNA-Seq in K562 cells to profile mRNA effects of perturbations in ~10K genes. We will map this
dataset to identify factors whose repression alters 18S, 28S levels. Impact: These studies will establish a
single cell ribosome abundance map in hematopoiesis, identify TFs and other factors that control ribosome
subunit levels, and prioritize novel candidates for study in normal and disordered hematopoiesis."

10977373,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen 10-fold over the past half century and
continues to have a dismal prognosis. Known modifiable risk factors for EAC do not adequately explain these
incidence trends; the rise in EAC cases began a decade before increases in the prevalence of both gastro-
esophageal reflux disease and obesity. Helicobacter pylori infection rates have plummeted since the mid-20th
century, and absence of H. pylori is associated with a ~2-fold increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus (BE), the
EAC precursor lesion, and of EAC itself. Loss of H. pylori is associated with profound shifts to gastric
microbiome composition. Thus, dramatic changes in the upper GI microbiome in western populations likely
occurred at the same time that BE and subsequently EAC began to rise in incidence. While prior work has
shown correlations between the microbiome, BE, and EAC, there is a critical knowledge gap on mechanisms
by which bacteria interact with the epithelium and potentially promote cancer. The mucus layer that overlies the
gut epithelium is critical to maintaining host-bacteria homeostasis. We hypothesize that increased levels of the
bile acid deoxycholic acid in gastro-esophageal refluxate results in increased Notch activity, which in turn
inhibits goblet cell differentiation and decreases mucus production. This may lead to mucus layer thinning,
facilitating the development of biofilms and leading to increased bacterial-epithelial interaction and chronic
inflammation, which promotes the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In Aim 1, we will carry
out a case-control study of patients with and without BE, dysplasia, or EAC. We will focus on deoxycholic acid
in gastro-esophageal refluxate and its association with Notch signaling and bacterial composition. In Aim 2, we
focus on the relationship between Notch signaling and Enterobacteriaceae, which is increased in patients with
high grade dysplasia and early EAC. Finally, in Aim 3, we will perform a series of organoid-based experiments
to test the inter-relatedness between Notch, deoxycholic acid, and bacteria in BE. The microbiome represents
a novel and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development of BE and EAC. Elucidation of microbiome
features and mechanisms that promote neoplasia is a critical step that will lead to subsequent trials of
antibiotics, probiotics, and other interventions targeted to altering the microbiome, with the goal of lowering the
risk of this highly lethal malignancy."
10975899,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Because elevated intraocular pressure
(IOP) and IOP fluctuations are the primary risk factors for loss of visual field, the current standard of care
for adult-onset glaucoma includes treatment with IOP-lowering medications, which are typically delivered topically
as eye drops. Unfortunately, the need for self-administration negatively affects patient compliance. Moreover,
there are a limited number of drug families that are in use. In a major step toward addressing the limitations of
currently marketed IOP-lowering drops, we engineered a novel non-irritative microemulsion (ME) formulation that
provides extended release of pregabalin (PRG)¾a repurposed FDA-approved drug with a new mechanism of
action for IOP-lowering. While our ME has many features that position it to fill major gap in IOP management, it
requires daily self-dosing. To directly address this unmet clinical need, we will optimize and evaluate the
IOP-lowering properties and safety of a subconjunctival biodegradable electrospun depot containing
PRG. OculoTherapy’s long-term research goal is to develop therapies that preserve vision in glaucoma patients.
In this current SBIR Phase I application, we test the hypothesis that a subconjunctival depot comprised of slowly
biodegradable and biocompatible nanospun polymers can be engineered to provide zero order release of
PRG, which will maintain IOP in the physiological range until the depot is spent. Our objective is to ultimately
achieve 6 months of release from a single depot. Our hypothesis is supported our preliminary data demonstrating
that PRG-loaded nanofibers comprised of a polymeric blend provide release of PRG with only 54.4% of loaded
drug being released after 21 weeks, demonstrating that 6 months of release from a single depot is well within
range. Overall strengths of this project include: 1) a strong and experienced interdisciplinary OculoTherapy team;
2) engineering of an innovative delivery strategy using a polymeric biocompatible depot that is expected to
provide extended drug release; 3) the use of a highly promising FDA-approved drug that is being repurposed as a
glaucoma therapeutic; and 4) the potential for a highly significant increase in patient adherence because the need
for daily input from the patient is eliminated. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we provide proof-of-concept data and
address key feasibility questions by establishing the safety and efficacy of a bioengineered
subconjunctivally placed polymer depot. Aim 1: We test the hypothesis that a subconjunctival electrospun depot
comprised of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers can provide up to 6 months of zero order release of
PRG. Several polymers and polymer blends will be evaluated either alone or in combination. Aim 2: We test the
hypothesis that our subconjunctival PRG depot is biocompatible and efficacious. IOP and safety will be evaluated.
Ocular biodistribution studies will also be performed. Minimum performance metrics include: 1) a sustained
decrease in IOP for 6 months from a single depot; 2) no significant development of tolerance or foreign body
response; and 3) an intraocular distribution of the drug that correlates with its effect on IOP reduction."
10975906,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder that has an incidence rate of
about 1.1% among all malignancies and constitutes 12-13% of hematologic malignancies in the
US. The epidemiology is similar in our veteran population and includes a 3-fold higher
prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a premalignant lesion, in
African American veterans. Renal dysfunction, determined by serum creatinine elevation ≥ 1.3
mg/dl, is frequently (about 48%) associated with MM, and an increase in the serum creatinine
concentration beyond 2.0 mg/dl portends a poor prognosis. One large study concluded that
reversibility of renal function was a more important prognostic factor than response to
chemotherapy. Recent work has shown that monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC)
produced in multiple myeloma are biologically active proteins that generate intracellular
oxidative stress in the proximal tubule and promote significant changes in epithelial cell biology.
The working hypothesis of this application is that the physicochemical structure of the variable
domain of the FLC determines the type and consequences of tubulointerstitial renal disease in
myeloma.
 To address this hypothesis, two aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Determine if susceptibility of the CDR3 domain to proteolysis is a determinant of cast
nephropathy. FLC may serve as substrates for kidney proteases; cleavage of the CDR3
domain opens the loop structure, changing the secondary structure, which affects binding to
THP. Hypothesis: resistance of the CDR3 domain to protease cleavage is a critical
determinant of binding to THP and development of cast nephropathy.
Aim 2. Define the role of redox signaling in the development of progressive kidney disease in
cast nephropathy. Hypothesis: nephrotoxic monoclonal FLCs promote a pro-
inflammatory/fibrotic state that stimulates an AKI to CKD transition.
Aim 2.1 Determine the function of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1)
 in FLC nephrotoxicity. Hypothesis: STAT1 activation in kidney epithelium produces
 IL-1b and TGF-b and plays a critical role in the development of CKD following AKI
 due to cast nephropathy.
Aim 2.2 Determine if the intrinsic ability of the FLC to generate hydrogen peroxide is involved
 in the development of myeloma kidney. Hypothesis: the production of hydrogen
 peroxide by FLCs is a critical element in the generation of progressive kidney injury.
 The proposal will use in vitro and in vivo models to determine how monoclonal FLCs
generate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic growth factors that induce tubulointerstitial renal
fibrosis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to shift clinical practice paradigms in the
management of progressive renal failure occurring in the setting of MM, by exploring novel
theoretical concepts to devise strategies that limit the development of chronic kidney disease
and thereby improve outcomes in MM."
10975914,"In the United States alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~15% of adults. While those numbers alone are striking,
patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 3 times more likely to develop AUD compared
to the population at large. This relationship is even more worrisome in Veteran populations as VA medical records
suggest 63% of Veterans with AUD are co-diagnosed with PTSD. Co-morbid AUD and PTSD represents a major
healthcare issue given that chronic excessive alcohol consumption in Veteran populations with PTSD intensifies
symptoms of PTSD including overgeneralization of the fear response and impaired fear memory extinction.
Clinically, the ability to treat co-morbid AUD and PTSD has not been addressed and our understanding of
maladaptive changes in common neural pathways which contribute to co-morbidity AUD and PTSD is limited.
Therefore, in order to develop effective therapies for co-morbid AUD and PTSD we must improve our knowledge
of why these disorders exhibit a strong relationship by pursuing new hypotheses using cutting edge techniques.
Recently, the endocrine hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), known for its potent metabolic effects,
was illustrated to significantly reduce alcohol consumption via an undescribed mechanism requiring expression
of the obligate FGF21 co-receptor β-klotho (KLB) in the brain. Importantly, single nucleotide polymorphisms in
both FGF21 and KLB genomic loci are highly associated with increased alcohol consumption in humans. Our
preliminary data presented in this proposal illustrates that excessive alcohol consumption promotes FGF21
secretion from the liver. Additionally, mice lacking FGF21 expression in the liver exhibit increased preference for
alcohol suggesting FGF21 signaling in response to alcohol consumption represents a homeostatic feedback
loop to negatively regulate alcohol consumption. Furthermore, we find that FGF21 signaling through KLB
expressing (KLB+) neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is necessary for FGF21 to suppress alcohol
consumption. Interestingly, FGF21 signaling in the BLA also appears to be necessary for enhanced fear memory
associated with chronic alcohol consumption suggesting FGF21 signaling in the BLA influences both alcohol
consumption and fear memory. In the BLA we have identified two distinct populations of KLB+ neurons which
project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or the central amygdala (CeA). Neurons in the BLA which project to
these regions have previously been illustrated to regulate alcohol consumption and fear memory. Relatedly,
these same projection populations have been described to encode the emotional valence of cues associated
with reward and aversion. Thus, in this proposal we hypothesize that FGF21 signaling through KLB+ neurons in
the BLA which project to the NAc or the CeA influences alcohol consumption and fear memory through
modulating the valence encoding properties of these neurons. This proposal takes advantage of optrode
recording, in vivo calcium imaging, and optogenetics to investigate how FGF21 signaling in projection defined
populations of KLB+ neurons in the BLA influences valence encoding, alcohol consumption, and fear
conditioning to improve our understanding of how shared neural substrates contribute to AUD and PTSD. As a
postdoctoral research fellow with experience investigating how FGF21 signaling in the brain regulates
physiological homeostasis I will perform the experiments described in this proposal under the mentorship of Dr.
Matthew Potthoff and Dr. Ted Abel. The career development plan accompanying this proposal is designed to
achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent VA-funded researcher. Immediate goals associated with
this proposal, such as learning optrode recording and calcium imaging, as well as obtaining a tenure track faculty
position will facilitate accomplishing my long-term career goal. Key aspects of the career development plan
include technical and professional mentorship provided by my mentors and a Scientific Advisory Committee
designed specifically to accomplish the goals of this proposal. Formal courses on scientific writing and leadership
as well as research conferences will supplement the training provided by my Scientific Advisory Committee."
10977522,"ABSTRACT
The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in
cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to
immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious
challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological
activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can
obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment
heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to
accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems.
We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular
content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the
most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of
the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image-
localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our
understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology
and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the
radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for
prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal
relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the
radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making."

Live cell reporters of genetic changes in stiff vs soft surroundings – causes & consequences
Solid tumors are often palpably stiff and more constrained in 3D growth than ‘liquid’ hematopoietic tumors.
Extensive sequencing of dozens of cancer types further indicates that solid tumors within stiff tissues exhibit
many more genetic changes than liquid and soft-tissue tumors [Pfeifer 2017]. Our first hypothesis is a
mechano-genetics hypothesis, namely genetic changes are caused in part by the mechanics of the tumor or
tissue micro-environment. A key limitation of current sequencing methods is that they require killing cells to
isolate the DNA, which prevents tracking a cell before, during, and after a genetic change. A new method is
needed to track genetic changes in living cells under diverse biophysical stresses. Our second hypothesis is
that gene editing can be used to enable tracking some changes in the genetics of single cells in real-time.
 Preliminary results from a new approach already support both hypotheses. RFP (red fluorescent
protein) is fused to a single allele of an abundant constitutive gene in cancer cells or normal cells. For
appropriate genes, we find that RFP-neg cells have lost all or part of the edited chromosome, using methods
that range from single cell DNA-seq to allele-specific PCR. For the one edited chromosome that has been
studied most deeply (of three), the RFP-neg cells divide and pass on the genetic change, and they also exhibit
a ‘go-and-grow’ phenotype consistent with partial loss of a key tumor suppressor. In solid tumor xenografts that
start with freshly sorted RFP-pos cells, the fraction of RFP-neg cells scales strongly with the number of cell
divisions, unlike 2D cultures, and 3D imaging further shows that (i) dividing cells are flattened in vivo, and (ii)
interphase nuclei with high curvature tend to rupture and exhibit high DNA damage. In reductionist 3D culture
studies, confinement and constriction likewise increase GFP-neg cell numbers. The preliminary results directly
support our mechano-genetics hypothesis.
 We will replicate and extend our preliminary results both in vitro and in vivo with the ultimate goals of
identifying mechanically modulated pathways of chromosome loss and consequences for phenotype. For
relevance to patients, the in vivo studies will include liver cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are
gene edited and grown in liver as well as softer and stiffer sites."
10977525,"Abstract
Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with endocrine therapy improves outcomes for metastatic
estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative, breast cancer patients. However, the value of this combination
in potentially curable earlier stage patients is variable. Our preliminary results examined the evolutionary
trajectories of early stage breast cancer tumors using single cell transcriptomic profiling of serial tumor biopsies
from a clinical trial of preoperative endocrine therapy alone (letrozole) or in combination with the cell cycle
inhibitor ribociclib. Resistant tumors with accelerated loss of estrogen signaling show up-regulation of the JNK
pathway, while those that maintain estrogen signaling during therapy show potentiation of CDK4/6 activation
consistent with ERBB4 and ERK signaling up-regulation. Cell cycle reconstruction identified that tumors cells
can reactivate during combination treatment, indicating stronger selection for a proliferative state. We
hypothesize that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in earlier stage breast cancer is driven by JNK MAPK
pathway stimulation and reactivation of the cell cycle through promotion of CDK6 expression or
decreased cell cycle inhibitor function. In Aim 1, we will use a new mechanistic model of CDK4/6 regulation
by cell cycle Inhibitors and Promoters (CIP) that couples estrogen and JNK signaling with cell cycle progression
to measure the mechanisms driving cell cycle activation in a series of isogenic cell lines sensitive and resistant
to CDK4/6 and endocrine inhibitors and in patient tumor cells. This analysis will reveal how distinct signaling
pathways contribute to cell cycle reactivation during estrogen, CDK4/6 and JNK inhibition treatments and provide
signatures of each resistant mechanism across cell types, over time and between systems. Aim 2 leverages our
collection of patient tumors from the FELINE clinical trial to discover the intracellular and intratumoral resistance
mechanisms driving proliferation. Fundamental resistance mechanisms will be measured in over ~300,000
patient cells from 360 tumor samples using single cell RNA sequencing data already in hand to identify core
intracellular signaling states that act alone or in concert to drive proliferation. Next, the population of cells within
each tumor will be analyzed to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity and how resistant populations differ in growing
or shrinking tumors during drug treatment. Applying CIP to project proliferation across patient tumor cells will
allow prediction of inhibitor strategies that most effectively block intracellular and intratumoral proliferation. Lastly,
Aim 3 will apply a series of JNK pathway drugs with clinical potential to design and test treatment strategies that
maintain durable inhibition of proliferation in ER+ cancer cells. Iterative feedback between mathematical models
and patient/experimental data serves to provide a deep understanding of cell cycle regulation and mechanisms
of dysregulation leading to resistance. Together, these experiments will reveal the balance between estrogen
and alternative mediated JNK signaling, and their roles in resistance and provide a guide for therapeutic regimes
with more durable control of cancer cell proliferation."

 Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical reactions for the synthesis of compounds that could be used
as medicines. We will build upon our expertise in the synthesis of cyclic peroxides, a family of natural products
that exhibit a broad range of biological activities, suggesting their application to the treatment of malaria, cancer,
and viral and bacterial infections. During the proposed funding period, we will investigate our hypothesis that
initiation of ferroptosis is a general property of cyclic peroxides, and we will optimize the potency and metabolic
stability of FINO2, a cyclic peroxide we developed that initiates cell death by a new mechanism. The target of
FINO2 is unknown so we will study the mechanism by which cyclic peroxides like FINO2 initiate programmed cell
death, in collaboration with Professor Brent Stockwell (Columbia University). We will also develop new methods
for the synthesis of the cyclic peroxide structural motif found in many naturally occurring peroxides. We will also
investigate the synthesis of aromatic peroxides, a structural class whose synthesis and reactivity have not been
addressed. In the proposed funding period, we will also extend our investigations of mechanisms of acetal
substitution reactions, which are important methods in natural product synthesis and carbohydrate chemistry.
Using systematic studies of model systems, we can identify the factors that contribute to the stability and
reactivity of oxocarbenium ions, which are intermediates involved in many of the reactions of carbohydrates,
including enzymatic reactions. We will determine how the carboxyl group in sugars such as sialic acids influence
the stereoselectivity of reactions involving these sugars. We will demonstrate remote neighboring-group
participation as a means of controlling stereoselectivity in cyclic and acyclic compounds. The proposed research
is innovative because it addresses structural types and reactive intermediates that have received little attention
in the literature. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to new pathways for making biologically
active compounds and will provide deeper mechanistic understanding of chemical and biological processes.
These studies are relevant to human health because they could result in drugs that kill cells by unique pathways,
leading to new treatments for various diseases. Furthermore, the mechanistic understanding of intermediates
involved in reactions of carbohydrates could lead to new ways of designing enzyme inhibitors."

The TA Core proposes to advance health equity by prioritizing organizations that serve minoritized populations who are historically marginalized and disproportionately impacted by substance use, overdose, and criminal legal system (CLS) involvement. TA includes activities to increase awareness of research findings, identify pertinent scientific studies, facilitate one-on-one discussions and partnerships with researchers, customize evidence-informed practices to local needs, assist with evaluation plans, facilitate dissemination and implementation support, and establish enduring learning communities and toolkits. The TA Core will center on cultural competence, humility, and the empowerment of organizations to use data and research to improve practices. The proposed TA Core will be administered by Dr. Howard Henderson from Texas Southern University and pursue three aims. Aim 1: Provide community-based organizations, justice/criminal legal system organizations, and other state and local government agencies with ready access to research findings, particularly from JCOIN 1.0 and 2.0 studies, that are pertinent to advancing the use and uptake of evidence-informed treatments and practices. Aim 2: Provide hands-on technical assistance to facilitate implementation and uptake of research findings into practice using proven implementation strategies, including quality improvement processes and learning communities. Aim 3: Develop materials that address the needs of stakeholders to implement evidence-informed practices. A central feature of the TA work is to facilitate researcher-practitioner partnerships which can enhance strategic planning, fill gaps in treatment and service delivery needs, develop and implement evidence-driven programs and strategies, and engage in continual evaluation, quality improvement, and innovation. A special feature of the proposed TA Core is the ability to customize TA to the needs of the requesting organization/jurisdiction. The range of TA activities includes customized assessment, virtual learning or consultation, peer-to-peer interactions, access to researchers working in areas of interest, and website exchanges. TA team members will work with requesting organizations to assess needs, identify resources, and facilitate exchanges with researchers or organizations that have adopted and/or implemented empirical research into practice to reduce overdoses and address health inequity issues.

10976499,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with high co-
morbidity for intellectual disability. This includes difficulties forming episodic, personal narrative, memories that
are critical for orderly thinking and organizing future behaviors. Episodic memory deficits are thus thought to be
major contributors to cognitive difficulties associated with autism. Many brain changes underlying abnormalities
in ASD appear in childhood suggesting the possibility for effective therapeutic strategies targeting brain
maturation. One candidate therapeutic is the hypothalamic peptide Oxytocin (OXT). Postnatal OXT treatment
improves social behavior in animal models of ASDs and recent work indicates that treatment in childhood
improves social interactions in autistic individuals. OXT acutely facilitates forms of synaptic plasticity, but there
has been little experimental consideration of possible enduring effects of postnatal OXT treatment on learning
and no analyses of effects on episodic memory. We examined this possibility using intranasal OXT (iOXT)
treatment in the Fmr1 KO mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome, and novel paradigms for analyses of `What,
When and Where' encoding. Our preliminary results show that in Fmr1 KOs iOXT treatments during the
second postnatal week (P7-13) fully rescue hippocampal field CA1 long-term potentiation, object location
memory, object identity (What) learning, and social recognition as assessed in adulthood (i.e., >40d after the
last treatment). These findings raise the exciting possibility that a limited period of early life OXT treatment can
effect a life-long rescue of a critical element of cognitive function in ASD. They also raise questions as to the
breadth of effects iOXT has on behavior and the mechanisms involved; these questions will be addressed in
the proposed studies. Aim 1 studies will test if postnatal iOXT treatment of male and female Fmr1 KO mice
rescues encoding for the three major components of episodic memory, social recognition and stereotypic
behavior as assessed in adulthood, and if effects depend on native OXT efflux. We will also determine if there
is a critical period for enduring iOXT effects on behavior. Aim 2 will use electrophysiological recordings of
evoked responses and network activity, analyses of synaptic proteins and signaling, and measures of neuronal
arbors to test if postnatal iOXT treatment normalizes neurobiological processes in the distinct hippocampal
subdivisions related to episodic memory encoding. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that early life iOXT
leads to activation of synaptic trophic factor receptors (EGFR, TrkB) in hippocampus, thereby suggesting a
direct route for OXT effects on maturational changes in the structure. Overall, the proposed studies will greatly
expand our current knowledge of OXT actions in the young brain, including potentially critical roles in
regulating hippocampal development and synaptic function. Moreover, the results will lay the groundwork for
designing novel, early life regimens to optimize hippocampal maturation and function, and to rescue the
encoding of episodic memories in ASD and related developmental disorders."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately impacts Latino children, families and communities. T2D disparities are
the result of complex interactions that involve biological susceptibility and various interdependent social
determinants that represent the root causes of disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) established
that T2D can be prevented in high-risk adults through intensive lifestyle intervention. Although the DPP has been
translated to a variety of adult populations and settings, engagement and effectiveness is diminished in minority
communities and there are no family-focused diabetes prevention trials for Latinos. For over a decade, our team
has collaborated to address the social and cultural determinants of diabetes among Latino youth, in the midst of
extant disparities in access to care, low health literacy, and certain cultural norms that may increase diabetes
risk. Our culturally-grounded approach is guided by an Ecodevelopmental model that considers community,
family, peer, and individual-level factors that influence health behaviors and health outcomes over time. Through
a series of increasingly rigorous studies we established that a lifestyle intervention can significantly reduce T2D
risk factors and increase Quality of Life (QoL) among Latino adolescents with obesity. We now propose to build
upon our extensive experience working with the local Latino community to rigorously test the efficacy of a
family-focused diabetes prevention intervention for reducing T2D risk and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino
families. We will use Integrative Mixed Methods to understand how family structures and processes influence
intervention outcomes. We will examine the sustainability of the intervention at 12-months and explore mediators
and moderators of long-term changes. Lastly, we acknowledge that the current translational gap between
scientific discovery and real-world impact must be closed so that evidence-based interventions are expeditiously
scaled to advance towards health equity for vulnerable and underserved populations. Therefore, we will use the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework to guide areas for adaptation and
integration within key community-based organizations that may be well-positioned to adopt and implement
family-focused diabetes prevention programs. Our long-term goal is to build the evidence, network, and capacity
to scale multi-level, family-focused diabetes prevention programs across systems that serve vulnerable and
disadvantaged communities. As the next step towards this goal, we propose the following Primary Aim: Test
the efficacy of a 4-month, family-focused diabetes prevention intervention, compared to a family control
condition, for improving glucose tolerance and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino families.
Secondary Aim: Understand how family structure and family processes influence the reach, diffusion, and
impact of the intervention on the family system. Exploratory Aim: Examine mediators and moderators of 12-
month changes in glucose tolerance and QoL. Implementation Aim: Create a statewide, stakeholder-informed
plan to take family diabetes prevention to scale by 1) generating a rapid learning community with organizations
that serve Latino families in Arizona, 2) exploring the need, readiness, costs of, and capacity for implementation
across these organizations, and 3) planning adaptations and activities to enhance fit and function of the
intervention within these organizations."

American Indian and Alaska Native (Al/AN) populations have the highest opioid overdose related
death rate in the United States, and the rate continues to rise. At the same time, access to
prevention, treatment, and recovery services is limited to some Indian Health Service (IHS) and
Tribal health facilities, where provider shortages, confidentiality concerns, lack of culturally centered
services, mistrust of clinicians, and insufficient fiscal resources are commonplace. AI/ANs also face
unique social and structural conditions which intersect with substance use and perpetuate the
aforementioned disparities including colonialism and racism, historical and intergenerational
trauma, poverty, unemployment, mental health concerns, etc. The Native Collective Research Effort
to Enhance Wellness (N CREW) Program proposed by the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board,
Inc. (AAIHB), and its Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (AASTEC), therefore
aims to plan, develop, and implement community-led research, research capacity enhancement,
and data improvements, to respond to the opioid/drug public health emergency within our 27-Tribe
service area spanning across New Mexico, Colorado, Texas and Utah. Our overall goal is to build and
strengthen the research capacity within our tribal organization and the tribes we serve to generate
knowledge and improve outcomes related to overdose, substance use, and related factors including
mental wellbeing. Specific aims that we will pursue to achieve our overall goal during this initial
two-year program phase, center upon development and planning activities, including: 1) cultivate
research partnerships and elucidate community-prioritized research topics for future
implementation by AAIHB/AASTEC and its member tribes; 2) enhance capacity within our Tribal
Organization/Tribal Epidemiology Center, and the 27 member tribes in our service area, to conduct
locally prioritized research related to overdose, substance use, and related factors; and 3) improve
access to and the quality of Al/AN data on substance use and related health and wellbeing factors to
maximize their potential for use in local decision-making. Our primary hypothesis is that
strengthening research capacity within a tribal organization and its member tribes, and focusing
studies on tribally prioritized topics led by Native researchers and allies, will elucidate culturally
grounded, strengths-based, effective and sustainable intervention strategies that support substance
use prevention, treatment, and recovery."
10975182,"Sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction are common sensory disorders affecting 
millions of
individuals worldwide¹,². The primary cause of both hearing loss and peripheral vestibular 
disorders in humans is dysfunction of the inner ear, which can occur as a result of noise exposure, 
aging, genetic defects, environmental exposure to pathogens, and as a side effect of ototoxic 
medications. There are limited therapies for sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction, 
mainly due to the lack of understanding of some of the molecular mechanisms that govern the hearing 
and balance organs. There remain key unanswered questions about the genetic architecture and 
molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control used during mammalian development and within the 
adult inner ear. Recently, single cell RNA sequencing technology has shown the remarkable 
transcriptional heterogeneity of cell types and developmental dynamics of the mouse inner ear³??. 
However, transcriptional diversity and control is only one level of genetic regulation. One of the 
key underlying mechanisms of transcriptomic and protein diversity is through alternative splicing. 
Cells use alternative splicing to diversify their number of proteins, change translation 
efficiency, control transcript localization, and make non-coding RNAs?,?. Only a limited number of 
genes that undergo alternative splicing have been identified in the inner ear at cell type 
resolution?. Understanding alternative splicing of genes at the single cell level is critically 
important as any future therapies targeting a specific gene may have on/off target effects in 
different subsets of cells. We hypothesize that there is cell type-specific diversity of 
alternatively spliced mRNA within the mammalian inner ear. Moreover, regulation of alternative 
splicing events occurs through specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs). We will test this hypothesis 
through two aims: Aim 1 is to characterize the transcriptome-wide alternative splicing landscape of 
the mouse inner ear at single cell resolution. Using newly developed computational tools, we will 
identify alternatively spliced genes within both the developing and adult mouse inner ear for the 
entire transcriptome. Aim 2 will determine the role of RNA binding proteins in regulating 
alternative splicing programs in the inner ear at single cell resolution. Regulation of alternative 
splicing events is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that cells use to determine what splicing 
program mRNA goes through as carried out by RNA binding proteins. We will characterize the 
expression of RBPs within the developing mouse inner ear and link this to alternative splicing 
through computational and validation techniques to develop a spatial and temporal map of 
alternative splicing programs. In sum, we will define the heterogeneity of cell types based on 
single cell isoform-level data during development and in the adult mammalian inner ear, and we will 
identify the key players in regulating alternative splicing. This work will
d alternative splicing regulation during development and in
the adult inner ear that will be necessary for future development of targeted inner ear therapies."

10975089,"Rural Appalachian youth are at disproportionately high risk for suicide and experience significant barriers to
health care access. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) have the potential to address suicide risk among
this underserved population by providing routine evidence-based suicide risk screening, assessment, and
follow-up. The NIMH Clinical Pathway is an evidence-based suicide risk detection and management program
that has been found to be effective at addressing suicide risk among urban youth. However, the feasibility and
impact of the NIMH Clinical Pathway have not been evaluated in rural Appalachian SBHCs, who face unique
contextual, resource, and cultural barriers to implementation. To address this health care disparity, we propose
a pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation type-1 study that will use mixed methods and a stepped
wedge design to adapt, implement, and evaluate the NIMH Clinical Pathway in two SBHCs located in rural
Appalachia. This study will gather data regarding the specific needs of rural Appalachian youth and providers in
the SBHC setting, use a Quality Improvement (QI) approach to modify the pathway and tailor implementation,
and gather preliminary data on the effectiveness and sustainability of the modified pathway. Data, training
materials, and implementation strategies developed can be disseminated to practices throughout rural
Appalachia and will be used to support a future R01 trial of the NIMH Clinical Pathway in these Appalachian
settings. This study has the following three aims:
Aim 1: To adapt the NIMH Clinical Pathway and tailor implementation to address the unique needs of the rural
Appalachian SBHC care setting and gather preliminary data on its feasibility, appropriateness, and
acceptability.
Aim 2: To examine the preliminary effectiveness of the adapted NIMH Clinical Pathway compared to
Treatment as Usual (TAU) on overall screening and detection rates as well as service and patient outcomes for
youth identified as at risk for suicide.
Hypothesis 2a: Overall proportions of screening will be significantly higher during the intervention phase than
during TAU and risk detection rates will increase.
Hypothesis 2b: Youth receiving the modified NIMH Clinical Pathway will show improvements in service and
patient outcomes (safety planning, follow-up visits, suicidal ideation/behavior, depression, and safety
plan/acute care usage) compared to TAU.
Aim 3: To identify barriers to and facilitators of implementation and sustainability of the adapted NIMH Clinical
Pathway in the rural Appalachian SBHC setting.
This innovative pilot study will address a critical health care disparity by identifying strategies to increase the
widespread adoption of an evidence-based suicide prevention program for rural Appalachian youth."
10975316,"Project Summary/Abstract
 To meet national needs of the future, the United States must increase the production of biomedical college
graduates and draw on a broader range of talent, particularly among historically excluded communities (HECs).
Yet an alarming proportion of college students who declare STEM majors switch to other majors before
graduating. Moreover, students who belong to certain HECs enter STEM at the same rates as their white peers
but leave far more frequently: 44% of white students leave STEM before graduation, whereas 58% of Latine and
66% of Black students leave. A seminal study of the reasons students leave STEM found that students frequently
cite a fear of failure as important, but failure is rarely included as a topic in STEM coursework or as a focus for
interventions. Therefore, a better understanding of the impact of failure and approaches that de-stigmatize
and normalize failure is needed to assure greater success and retention of diverse students in the
biomedical sciences.
 Scientists are affected by two types of failure that are natural parts of a career in science—personal setbacks
and scientific failures—which influence advancement in academic and professional paths. But many students
interpret a failure in college due to academic or personal struggles or due to failed experiments as an indication
that they lack the ability to succeed in the biomedical sciences. In reality, when students encounter learning
challenges, personal roadblocks, or wrong hypotheses and failed experiments, they must tap into productive
failure responses to identify support structures, figure out what went wrong, adjust their approach, and try again.
Productive responses to failures can be personal (e.g., a growth mindset; scientific self-efficacy, fear mitigation
tools) or actionable, scientific approaches such as troubleshooting an experiment. By learning productive failure
responses, students develop problem-solving skills, reasoning, and resilience, which strengthen a sense of
belonging and lead to persistence in science.
 This study hypothesizes that if students are taught about failures experienced by successful
scientists or engage in a structured research experience, they will be less discouraged when they
experience difficulties or failures. This research will study the effects of an intervention on student failure
responses and STEM persistence. The first experiment will test the effect of videos about personal and scientific
failures on students’ behaviors and attitudes about failure and STEM persistence. The second will test these
videos in two educational contexts, one containing a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE),
which may have synergistic effects with the intervention. To assess their failure responses, students will
complete a survey and attempt an impossible scientific task—a biology video game. The analysis will seek to
understand the interactions between the video intervention and participation in a CURE, student demographics,
and course characteristics such as class size and placement in the curriculum."
10975317,"Summary
This R35 focuses on novel mechanisms underlying control of key UPR components that impact melanoma
metastasis in aged rather than young mice by (i) tumor-intrinsic mechanisms (NRF2, ATF4) implicated in
resistance or sensitivity to therapy, and (ii) tumor-extrinsic mechanisms that define intestinal microbiota
composition and impact anti-tumor immunity. This OIA application leverages discoveries made during our R35
support period, which enabled us to define the regulation and function of ATF4, one of the main UPR signaling
components, in pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. Several fundamental discoveries will be pursued. (1) the effect
of aging on altered metabolic signaling, as exemplified by effects of asparagine synthase (ASNS) and glutaryl-
CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) on ATF4. Specifically, while ASNS inhibition promotes melanoma resistance to
therapy, GCDH inhibition causes melanoma cell death, although both phenotypes are ATF4-dependent. (2) the
effect of aging on gut microbiota composition with concomitant impact on the degree of anti-tumor immunity and
tumor propensity to metastasize. Among fundamental questions we will address are: (i) What confers ATF4 pro-
apoptotic vs. anti-apoptotic activities and how are these affected during aging (ii) How do gut microbiota, and
changes in bacterial commensals that occur with aging, impact anti-tumor immunity and tumor metastasis? (iii)
Could ATF4 inhibition (through targeting some of its modulators) be used as a novel strategy to enhance tumor
sensitization to therapy in young and aged animals? To answer these questions, we will employ innovative
technologies, including conditional knock-out mice, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, single-cell RNAseq, spatial
transcriptomics, metabolomics, and computational approaches. Models of young (2 months) and aged (12-15
months = 55–70-year-old human) mice will be used to define mechanisms underlying how a key UPR signaling
component, ATF4, impacts melanoma metastasis mechanisms. In all, these studies should reveal novel
paradigms in melanoma biology impacting metastasis under relevant physiological conditions."
10977492,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of melanoma has doubled in the last three decades and is projected to exceed 100,000 cases in
the US in 2020. Almost 7,000 people died of melanoma in the US in 2019. Melanoma has a strong propensity
to spread both via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. The most common sites of metastasis include lymph
nodes, lung, liver and brain. Although novel therapies, such as immunotherapies have improved survival of
patients with metastatic disease, metastatic patterns can influence responses to such therapies. In particular,
patients with metastases to the liver have a lower response and survival rates in response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors compared to patients with metastases to other organs. The molecular underpinnings of liver metastasis
development and the impact on drug response and resistance are poorly understood. This is in part due to limited
pre-clinical models that resembles metastatic patterns seen in patients, and a sparsity of genomic
characterization of human liver metastatic lesions. The goal of this proposal is to determine drivers of melanoma
liver metastasis (MLM) and mechanisms of associated resistance to immunotherapies. For this purpose, we
characterized and used a novel syngeneic mouse model that faithfully recapitulates genomic, metastatic and
response patterns seen in patients. We performed a large-scale in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified
perturbations that promote development of MLM, but not primary tumor growth or metastasis to other organ
sites. In the first aim of this proposal, we elucidate the cell intrinsic signaling mechanisms promoting MLM. Next,
using integrated high-plex imaging, immune-profiling and single-cell sequencing, we determine the immune
infiltrates of MLM and concurrent lung metastases and how the immune compartment impacts the response to
clinically used immunotherapies. Finally, we assembled a large cohort of patient biopsies from liver metastases
and concurrent metastases from other organ sites as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for
genomic and immune profiling. Together, these studies will provide a landscape of genomic determinants,
signaling mechanisms and immune environments of MLM and their impact on responses to immunotherapies
and have the potential to identify novel avenues for rationale drug development."
10975578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Childhood respiratory diseases pose a significant health burden and lack primary prevention
strategies. With genetics explaining only a fraction of the risk, the highly adaptable human microbiome is of
particular interest. Multiple studies have linked asthma and allergy to the early-life gut and nasal microbiome, yet
results are inconsistent and current studies have significant limitations. Thus, despite this great promise, the
clinical potential of the microbiome remains unfulfilled: robust microbiome-based asthma predictors and targets
for primary prevention are yet to be developed, and potential mechanisms underlying its involvement remain
elusive. Further, breastfeeding, a key determinant of infant microbiome development, is associated with reduced
childhood asthma rates, yet the intricate relationships between breastfeeding, microbiota development, and
respiratory health remain poorly understood. Here, I propose to combine state-of-the-art algorithms with large
longitudinal studies and animal models to elucidate the intricate mechanisms through which breastfeeding and
microbial colonization modulates early-life respiratory health outcomes.
Approach: This grant will leverage two established birth cohorts (CHILD and COPSAC; > 14,000 samples 16S,
shotgun metagenomic and metabolomics) to investigate early-life microbiomes, across two microbial niches,
alongside breastfeeding characteristics, human milk components and detailed clinical outcomes from birth to
early adolescent. We will first develop an unsupervised machine-learning tool for dimensionality reduction of
longitudinal multi-omics data to identify robust colonization patterns across microbial niches (Aim 1). Next, we
will identify microbial genetic adaptation and colonization patterns underlying childhood respiratory diseases. We
will use these to detect specific microbial functions and genetic regions associated with childhood respiratory
diseases, facilitating an investigation of potential mechanisms (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the role of
breastfeeding and breastmilk as regulators of microbiome-asthma interactions. We will develop a causal
inference framework alongside an animal model of weaning and examine the microbial and immune response
to early weaning as well as lung resistance (Aim 3).
Innovation: This study represents a paradigm shift in research through several key innovations: (1) a dynamic
approach capturing microbial communities over time for more robust and reproducible results; (2) simultaneous
modeling of nasal/airway and gut microbiomes across large birth cohorts, revealing shared patterns; (3)
metagenomic sequencing, growth rates, structural variations, and selection metrics for population genetic
insights; (4) integration of human milk composition analysis; (5) a novel early weaning model; and (6) state-of-
the-art computational methods for precise multi-omics time-series analysis. Overall, by uniting large longitudinal
datasets with advanced algorithms and in vivo models, this research will advance our understanding of the
intricate links between the microbiome, breastfeeding, and childhood respiratory health outcomes."

10975648,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The research proposed in this application aims to study the impact of the publication of the 2016 Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analgesic prescribing guidelines on disparities in opioid utilization
among older adults who have opioid-responsive pain. These CDC guidelines were published at that time to
help curb the rising number of overdose-related deaths related to prescription and illicit opioids, which have
caused the death of over half a million people in the United States since 1999. The guidelines recommended
cautious use or avoidance of opioid medications in persons with chronic, non-cancer pain and those not near
the end of life. However, preliminary evidence suggests that these guidelines may have had an unintended
effect of limiting access to legitimate and medically necessary opioids in people with serious illnesses. This is
of particular concern among vulnerable subgroups of older adults known to be risk of pain undertreatment. Our
analyses will focus on three highly vulnerable subgroups of older adults who have been found to be at
increased risk of pain undertreatment – persons with Alzheimer’s and related dementias (PW-ADRD), those
identifying as racial/ethnic minoritized individuals, and those experiencing socioeconomic deprivation. For each
of these three subgroups, we will employ two models of opioid-responsive pain conditions – chronic cancer
pain and acute pain from orthopedic trauma – for which the CDC guidelines were not intended to apply and for
which opioids remain a mainstay of therapy for pain control. These two conditions are common in older adults
and are often associated with moderate to severe pain. For each of the three subgroups of older adults, we will
utilize the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to obtain sociodemographic and clinical information on
opioid prescribing from 2010 to 2020. MCBS is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of
the Medicare population, with data collected three times per year over a 4-year period and approximately
15,000 respondents each year, and includes linked fee-for-service Medicare Part A and B claims, participant-
reported prescribed medicines, and records of Medicare Part D pharmacy events. We will use a difference-in-
differences design to compare the unintended impact of the 2016 CDC guidelines on opioid utilization from
2010-2020 in the following groups of older adults who have either cancer or hip or pelvic fracture: PW-ADRD
compared to persons without ADRD (Aims 1-3), those with self-reported income at or below the federal poverty
line, compared to individuals with higher income (Aim 2), and racial/ethnic minoritized older adults compared to
white older adults (Aim 3)."
10977799,"ABSTRACT – MECHANISTIC PHARMACODYNAMIC MODELING FOR DRUG COMBINATIONS
Most industries simulate design options before implementation, but this is rarely possible in the pharmaceutical
and medical industries. An important gap is unbiased drug combination response predictions, which is
experimentally impractical. A long-term vision of our lab is improving drug development and precision medicine
by building “mechanistic pharmacodynamic models” that can simulate drug combination responses. Such
models infuse pharmacology concepts with physics and engineering approaches to describe causal, quantitative,
and dynamic mechanisms underlying drug response. A foundational premise is that capturing (i) mechanistic,
causal network structure, (ii) dose-response, (iii) dynamics, and (iv) cell-cell variability is necessary to improve
many combination response predictions. Here, we study how drug combinations affect single-cell
proliferation and death fates by merging theoretical and experimental innovation. The first project builds
on our recent and one of the most comprehensive mechanistic models for regulation of single-cell proliferation
and death dynamics. We will leverage our involvement with a recent LINCS consortium effort that generated a
deep molecular characterization of perturbation response dynamics, including dose responses to 8 drugs. We
will integrate network biology with mechanistic models using new approaches to obtain candidate models that
are consistent with this dataset, and experimentally test drug combination predictions for the 8 drugs. This will
for the first time address the prediction of a comprehensive set of drug combination responses across varied
mechanisms of action relying on causal biochemical reasoning and also identify novel mechanisms of signaling
and drug response through iterative model refinement and experimental validation. The second project builds
on our recently developed experimental approach for fluorescence multiplexing called MuSIC. We propose that
MuSIC can enable high-dimensional genetic interaction screening in single mammalian cells, which is not yet
possible but would be transformative. We will test the approach by evaluating genetic interactions between a
recently curated set of 667 gene targets of 1,578 FDA-approved drugs. This work will nominate new network
structures not only for use in the first project, but also more generally. The third project also leverages the
above mechanistic model but pivots across cell lines with Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data for 1,132 cell lines
and 24 drugs. An innovative and foundational feature of our model is that it ingests multi-omic data to create a
cell line-specific context through “initialization”. We will generate 1,132 model variants with cell line-specific
profiles and evaluate predictive capacity for single and prioritized drug combination responses. This project will
establish performance of the current models, identify critical modeling gaps for improving predictions, suggest
new potentially effective drug combinations, and elucidate mechanisms underlying synergy. Overall, these
projects will produce next-generation pharmacodynamic models that move towards filling the drug combination
prediction gap that hinders drug development and precision medicine."

10977518,"Project Summary:
 Metastatic cancer is a major clinical challenge that accounts for numerous deaths annually in the United
States, particularly in women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Many tumors develop within a
microenvironment (TME) characterized by altered/stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM) and compromised
immunity. These alterations play a causal role in malignancy and metastasis. Recently tumor-derived exosomes
have drawn tremendous interest as they are implicated in modulating the TME, suppressing anti-tumor immunity,
and preparing the metastatic site for progression. A hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to evade the immune
system. Exosomes play a pivotal role in the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. In this project, focusing on
TNBC, we explore how ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension (collectively referred to as tissue tension) regulate
exosome production and cargo composition, and how these exosomes contribute to the suppression of anti-
tumor immunity and promote metastasis. We pursue a unique set of hypotheses linking tissue tension to
exosome production and defining the role of tumor-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and metastatic
progression. To test our hypotheses, we have assembled a strong team from UPENN and UCSF, integrating
expertise in bioengineering, cancer mechanobiology, and cancer immunology. In Aim 1, we address whether
and how the tissue tension affects exosome production and alters exosome cargo in vitro in TNBC cells. We will
also delineate a molecular pathway linking ECM stiffness to intracellular signaling and exosome trafficking, using
experimental and subcellular biophysical modeling methods. In Aim 2, we address how tissue tension promotes
metastatic progression via exosomes in vivo. In this aim we test the hypothesis that the tension of the primary
tumor tissue enhances exosome production and alters exosome cargo to promote the dissemination of primary
tumor cells and foster their survival and outgrowth at the metastatic site. We will use unique genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic TNBC models, and TNBC patient PDXs, combined with
multiscale pharmacokinetic modeling. In Aim 3, we address how tissue tension contributes to the suppression of
anti-tumor immunity. In this aim, we will investigate the role of exosomes derived from tumors with high tension
in stiff ECM TMEs in suppressing anti-tumor immunity through (1) reprogramming macrophages against T cells;
and (2) the engagement of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint axis in T cells. We will use a combination of in vitro cell
culture experiments, in vivo genetically engineered mouse models and syngeneic transplant manipulations and
tissue-scale agent-based modeling. The expected results will shed light on the roles of exosomes in immune
regulation and metastatic tumor progression; these are important and timely questions in cancer research. The
results will lay the foundation for future therapeutic intervention of metastatic disease through the identification

10977519,"Project Summary:
 Metastatic cancer is a major clinical challenge that accounts for numerous deaths annually in the United
States, particularly in women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Many tumors develop within a
microenvironment (TME) characterized by altered/stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM) and compromised
immunity. These alterations play a causal role in malignancy and metastasis. Recently tumor-derived exosomes
have drawn tremendous interest as they are implicated in modulating the TME, suppressing anti-tumor immunity,
and preparing the metastatic site for progression. A hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to evade the immune
system. Exosomes play a pivotal role in the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. In this project, focusing on
TNBC, we explore how ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension (collectively referred to as tissue tension) regulate
exosome production and cargo composition, and how these exosomes contribute to the suppression of anti-
tumor immunity and promote metastasis. We pursue a unique set of hypotheses linking tissue tension to
exosome production and defining the role of tumor-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and metastatic
progression. To test our hypotheses, we have assembled a strong team from UPENN and UCSF, integrating
expertise in bioengineering, cancer mechanobiology, and cancer immunology. In Aim 1, we address whether
and how the tissue tension affects exosome production and alters exosome cargo in vitro in TNBC cells. We will
also delineate a molecular pathway linking ECM stiffness to intracellular signaling and exosome trafficking, using
experimental and subcellular biophysical modeling methods. In Aim 2, we address how tissue tension promotes
metastatic progression via exosomes in vivo. In this aim we test the hypothesis that the tension of the primary
tumor tissue enhances exosome production and alters exosome cargo to promote the dissemination of primary
tumor cells and foster their survival and outgrowth at the metastatic site. We will use unique genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic TNBC models, and TNBC patient PDXs, combined with
multiscale pharmacokinetic modeling. In Aim 3, we address how tissue tension contributes to the suppression of
anti-tumor immunity. In this aim, we will investigate the role of exosomes derived from tumors with high tension
in stiff ECM TMEs in suppressing anti-tumor immunity through (1) reprogramming macrophages against T cells;
and (2) the engagement of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint axis in T cells. We will use a combination of in vitro cell
culture experiments, in vivo genetically engineered mouse models and syngeneic transplant manipulations and
tissue-scale agent-based modeling. The expected results will shed light on the roles of exosomes in immune
regulation and metastatic tumor progression; these are important and timely questions in cancer research. The
results will lay the foundation for future therapeutic intervention of metastatic disease through the identification
of actionable biomarkers, development of new immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICB)-based therapies, and ultimately
reduce patient mortality."
10976404,"Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are a significant source of preventable morbidity and mortality.
Transmission models for HAI are a cornerstone method to both understand pathogen spread and evaluate
control interventions. Models have been particularly helpful in addressing transmission-blocking interventions,
for elucidating the connectivity among facilities, and their implications for controlling HAI. Mechanisms
underlying antimicrobial resistance, such as co-selection, have received less attention in transmission models.
In addition, key metrics—such as population-level fitness of resistant bacteria and the effect of resistant traits
on fitness—are often unknown. This limits our understanding of the complex relationship between antimicrobial
drug use and resistance, as well as the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing drug selection
pressure. The objective of this proposal is to develop models that more explicitly address resistance traits and
modeling tools that support the identification of transmission sources and pathways for HAI. We will use the
models to further identify HAI sources and evaluate and optimize interventions. In particular, we will address
the following thematic areas: antimicrobial resistance (A), surveillance (A), genomics (B), and simulation of
epidemiological studies (B). We have assembled an interdisciplinary group of researchers with expertise in
infectious disease modeling, HAI hospital epidemiology and clinics, applied mathematics, and genomics
located at North Carolina State University, Washington University (WU) and University of Tennessee. We plan
to build on our previous and current collaborations among this team to: develop modeling approaches for
addressing HAI transmission; extend phylodynamics methods; and model antimicrobial resistance dynamics.
The CDC-Epi Center at WU and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, will be the main source of data.
Additionally, we will use nation-level publicly available data sources. We will carry out the following aims: 1)
Develop improved approaches for inferring routes of acquisition of HAI and optimizing HAI surveillance and
control: We will develop ward- and hospital- level network models that take into account the main routes of HAI
acquisition and patient connectivity. We will apply optimization methods to identify environmental sampling
protocols and cost-effective control strategies. 2) Phylodynamics to estimate fitness of antimicrobial resistance
pathogens: We will apply and refine multi-type birth-death models to explore the fitness effects of a large
number of antimicrobial-resistant traits on pathogen phylogenies, and speed the methods to quantify fitness for
large numbers of strains, and 3) Multi-scale models for multidrug-resistant organisms: extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase (ESBL)- producing Enterobacteriaceae as case study: We will develop both agent- and
equation-based models that account for multi-scale dynamics of resistance transmission. This will greatly
expand the models’ applications for evaluating interventions such as antimicrobial stewardship and rapid
testing. Our models and tools will be made available to the broader community."
10975292,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the Audiology clinic, decision making is guided by evidence-based research supporting best practices, with
integration of multiple data sources including both objective test results and subjective patient reports in order
to inform recommendations and interventions. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to clinical care, rather
each patient must be holistically considered as an individual. This is particularly relevant for patients who are
members of minoritized populations, such as bilingual language users, who account for 21% of the population
of United States residents aged 5+.
There is evidence that bilingual speakers, even those who are highly proficient in both of their languages, show
performance deficits on speech-based measures, particularly when tested in the presence of background
noise. However, language history is not routinely queried by many clinicians, and standardized objective
patient reported outcome measurement tools aren’t written to take language history and usage into
consideration. This is especially important for the aging population, where both peripheral hearing loss and
central changes in cognitive capacity can combine to result in challenges with spoken communication,
especially in background noise. Preliminary work has shown that bilingual adults, even those who are currently
English dominant, show accelerated age-related declines in objective measures of suprathreshold auditory
function. It is important to know if these declines are reflected in subjective patient reports, and if the current
patient-reported outcome measures used in the audiology clinic can accurately capture changes in
communication ability in non-monolingual adults.
In this proposal, both objective and subjective measures of speech-in-noise recognition will be collected in a
large population of monolingual and bilingual active-duty service members, along with demographic
information including detailed language history questions, with the goal of identifying which gradient features of
bilingualism interact with age to impact objective and subjective SiN performance in bilingual adults across a
wide age range (Aim 1). Normative reference equations for speech-in-noise scores based on language and
demographic factors will be developed for use with bilingual adults (Aim 2). This research will also examine the
impact of task instructions on responses to patient-reported outcome measures of speech-in-noise
understanding (Aim 2) in order to determine the appropriate administration and interpretation of subjective
clinical measures with bilingual patients. The long term goal of the proposed project is to ensure that findings
regarding objective and subjective speech-in-noise measures used in the Audiology clinic are generalizable
across bilinguals who vary in terms of language background, age, and hearing status."
10975641,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe affective disorder impacting millions of women worldwide,
thought to be due to impaired sensitivity to hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Low-dose
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for PMDD, but their mechanism in
PMDD is poorly understood. Despite this morbidity and limited treatment options, research on PMDD’s
pathophysiology and treatment lags behind that of other brain disorders. A potential aspect of PMDD’s
pathophysiology is altered interaction between steroid hormones - specifically gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)ergic neuroactive steroids (NAS) - and their target, the GABA-A receptor (GABA-A-R). GABAergic NAS,
such as the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone, fluctuate across the menstrual cycle and are
associated with luteal phase symptom emergence in PMDD. The proposed study will examine three
aspects of GABAergic function in PMDD, to clarify its pathophysiology: 1) GABAergic NAS fluctuations,
particularly allopregnanolone (ALLO) and its isomers, 2) GABA-A-R subunit expression, and 3) GABAergic
neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression. A key focus of this placebo-controlled trial is to assess how these
parameters are affected by low-dose SSRI treatment in women with PMDD, shedding light on treatment
mechanism. In this multi-site study, we will assess 288 women with regular menstrual cycles (72 controls, 216
with PMDD), across the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In a second luteal phase, women with PMDD will
be randomized to sertraline or placebo. We will capture three outcome measures: 1) plasma NAS changes
within subjects at multiple timepoints across the luteal phase using precise gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) methods, 2) GABA-A-R subunit expression across the luteal phase in blood cells
measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and 3) GABAergic neurosteroidogenic enzyme
expression. We will compare controls versus women with PMDD, and within those with PMDD compare
sertraline versus placebo. The study explores a mechanistic hypothesis about NAS dynamics and GABA-A-R
plasticity in women with PMDD, and focuses on biologically relevant treatment target engagement. The
multiple investigators bring complementary expertise; Drs. Hantsoo and Payne in prospective studies of
reproductive affective disorders, and Dr. Pinna in applying state-of-the-art methods to study the impact of NAS
on GABA-A-R function. This study represents a critical step in elucidating NAS and GABA-A-R dynamics in
women with PMDD when treated with low-dose SSRIs, which may shed light on both pathophysiology and
treatment response mechanisms. Understanding PMDD’s pathophysiology may also inform treatment
development, i.e.GABA-modulating drugs that have recently emerged as treatments for postpartum depression.
Assessing parameters affected by SSRI in PMDD could lead to developing a personalized medicine approach."
10975693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is generally accepted that there is a link between a woman’s reproductive and overall health. Following
menopause, women are at an increased risk for developing diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer,
bone loss, cognitive disorders, and genitourinary dysfunction. Some diseases, such as polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS), demonstrate a direct link between reproductive and overall health through the presence of
both reproductive and non-reproductive phenotypes, including increased risk for infertility, obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease. The relationship between ovarian dysfunction and non-reproductive disease in PCOS is
complex - in part due to the altered hormonal environment related to pathologic ovarian follicle development.
Much of the disease has been attributed to excess androgen production, but some studies indicate that the
higher circulating levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B produced from the overabundant small
ovarian follicles may also contribute to PCOS. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between reproductive
and non-reproductive PCOS phenotypes is not fully understood. We have designed this exploratory R21 study
to fill this knowledge gap based on a newly discovered SMAD variant in a PCOS patient and her PCOS daughter
identified through the NIH-funded Rare and Atypical Diabetes Network (RADIANT) at Baylor College of Medicine.
These clinical and genomic data provide us the unique opportunity to analyze the role of altered TGFβ
superfamily signaling in driving ovarian defects and dysregulating metabolism. Structural studies and preliminary
data indicate that this rare variant is damaging and thus supports a hypothesis that altered TGFβ superfamily
member signaling has the potential to play a causal role in a subset of PCOS. These studies leverage our
published expertise in SMAD signaling and mouse models alongside cutting-edge proteomic analysis and
comprehensive phenotyping resources developed by the NIH-funded Knockout Mouse Phenotyping (KOMP)
Program at Baylor College of Medicine. Our two aims propose a broad biochemical analysis to determine how
this variant alters canonical and noncanonical SMAD properties, and identify the causal underpinnings of
reproductive and non-reproductive disease phenotypes in PCOS that emerge from defective SMAD signaling.
Thus, by studying this variant, we can uncover new mechanisms leading to PCOS outcomes as well as uncover
novel links between infertility and overall health, both of which may serve to broaden the range of pathways for
therapeutic targeting."
10975694,"Project Summary
Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a large group of lung diseases that are characterized by chronic, progressive
pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesize that in all ILDs the progressive fibrosis is driven by ongoing injury/stress in
the airway epithelial cells that set up crosstalk with their neighboring mesenchymal cells resulting in a chronic
wound healing process that alters the matrix and changes the cellular niche. The goal of the proposed research
is to address how interactions between the epithelial, mesenchymal and matrix compartments drive progression
of fibrosis in all forms of ILD. We are proposing to study these interactions between the epithelial, mesenchymal
and matrix compartments, which is now feasible with spatial transcriptomics, single cell secretion protein
analysis, and small region proteomics. Most studies have looked at end stage disease and fibrotic lesions where
most of the epithelial cells are lost and consequently the initiating and propagating factors are not well
understood. We propose to study Interstitial Lung Abnormality (ILA) lesions, which represent very early ILD
lesions, early stage ILD lesions when patients start to become symptomatic, and late stage ILD regions that still
contain epithelial cells so we can study their interactions with mesenchymal cells and matrix. To test our
hypothesis, we have developed a 3D scaffolded lung cell co-culture model system with progressive fibrosis that
closely models these cellular compartments in ILD tissue. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1: To understand epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the airway that drive fibrosis using spatial
transcriptomics. We will use our biobank of ILD and ILA samples and prospectively collect ILD and ILA patient
samples to profile the airway epithelium and underlying fibroblasts from bronchioles to distal airspaces with
spatial small region transcriptomics (GeoMx) and single cell spatial genome-wide transcriptomics (Stereoseq).
Aim 2: To understand epithelial, mesenchymal and matrix interactions in the airway that drive fibrosis.
Aim 2a: We will use the secretory-single cell profiling (Sec-seq) technology to capture single airway epithelial
cells, from fresh ILA and ILD tissue and trap the secretions from each cell to identify paracrine factors.
Aim 2b: We will use nanoscale small region proteomics to identify proteins in the adjacent epithelial,
mesenchymal and basement membrane matrix compartments from ILA and ILD samples.
Aim 3: To identify mechanisms by which persistent airway injury induces progressive fibrosis by using cell co-
culture models of iPSC derived AT2 cells with specific mutations associated with familial IPF, in conjunction with
primary healthy or IPF lung fibroblasts. These powerful reductionist models allow the study of specific epithelial-
mesenchymal-matrix interactions that drive progressive fibrosis.
We have assembled a team with expertise in spatial transcriptomics and ILDs (Gomperts), novel bioinformatics
pipelines and integration of genomics data (Plath), regional small-scale proteomics in ILDs (Clair), iPSC-derived
AT2 disease modeling and ILDs (Kotton) and bioengineered models of ILD (Gomperts)."

 The tremendous diversity across human lung diseases presents significant clinical challenges, but also
offers remarkable opportunities for capturing high-resolution disease mechanisms to more effectively treat
these conditions. Adhering to the mission of LungMAP phase II, our Research Center has generated, curated,
and made publicly available a rich array of high-quality single nucleus RNAseq and single nucleus ATACseq
datasets, focusing on normal developing lung and pediatric lung diseases. In LungMAP phase III, with the
extension into adult lung diseases, we will leverage our expertise on lung biology and single cell technologies
to embark on direct cross-disease comparisons, a recognized bottleneck in the next-stage disease mechanism
discoveries. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with strong expertise in lung biology, pulmonology,
surgery, pathology, single cell technology and computational biology, with a track record of working together
within and beyond the LungMAP consortium. Guided by the scientific premise that different lung diseases can
be distinguished by a finite set of signatures, we will test the hypothesis that these diseases differ in cell
type/cell state composition, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles, signaling and extracellular matrix
dynamics, among other dimensions. Capturing cutting-edge technologies, we present robust preliminary data
demonstrating the feasibility of using single nucleus Multiome (RNAseq and ATACseq from the same nucleus)
and spatial transcriptomic MERFISH (Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence in situ Hybridization)
technologies on tissues procured using an ultra-low ischemia time protocol. Critical to achieving precise cross-
disease comparisons, we show preliminary data demonstrating effective addition of multiplexing to these
technologies, which eliminated batch effect which was the major roadblock in previous comparison efforts. We
expect that the datasets that we will generate and make publicly available in LungMAP phase III will facilitate
paradigm-shifting studies by the collective lung research community."
10974203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Defining how FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) limit amnestic responses to common allergens has the
potential to provide new and effective therapies for asthma and other atopic diseases. Recent work has
demonstrated that T helper type 2 (Th2) tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) persist around the airways
following allergic sensitization where they become rapidly activated and drive the asthma phenotype upon
allergen re-exposure. The immunoregulatory mechanisms that limit the proinflammatory functions of Th2-Trm
at mucosal sites are less clear. The objective of this proposal is to define the factors influencing allergen-
specific resident (r) Treg maintenance in the lungs and their suppression of Th2-Trm following re-exposure to
inhaled allergen. Our central hypothesis is that allergen-specific rTregs are positioned in a unique niche in the
lung that enables potent suppression of allergic inflammation. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that rTregs co-
localize with Th2-Trm based upon the CXCR6 and CCR8 chemokine systems. This proposal will explore these
questions using novel experimental systems to define the function of rTregs in a mouse model of allergic
asthma, including polyclonal adoptive transfer of house dust mite (HDM)-specific cells, parabiosis, single cell
RNA sequencing analysis of HDM-specific T cells, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. With Aim 1, we will build
upon preliminary data to define the role of allergen-specific rTregs in suppressing lung Th2-Trm. We will
characterize the localization, persistence, suppressive potency, and transcriptional profile of the Tregs that
persist in the lung following allergen clearance. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of the CXCR6 and CCR8
chemokine systems in rTreg positioning and function. To identify additional factors important for the rTreg
tissue residency program and provide additional training in genome editing and systems biology, we will
perform an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen on HDM-specific TCR transgenic cells isolated from the HDM
memory lung. Dr. Nelson will perform the work in this K08 proposal, sponsored by Boston Children’s Hospital,
at the Center for Immunology and Inflammatory diseases (CIID) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
under the mentorship of Dr. Andrew Luster. Dr. Nelson has developed a career development plan consisting of
coursework in advanced microscopy, bioinformatics, and translational research, along with mentored hands-on
training in cutting-edge research methods to explore his research aims. The goal of this K08 award is to
provide Dr. Nelson with the necessary skills and knowledge to become an independent, NIH-funded
investigator with expertise in human disease models of atopic diseases and immunoregulation in non-lymphoid
tissues."

The overarching goal of this diversity supplement is to evaluate links among alcohol use, alcohol misuse, and
oxidative stress among a diverse sample of sexual minority young adults. I propose to analyze secondary data
from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study to address the proposed aims that fall
within the scope of the parent grant’s research objectives and expand upon it by identifying prospective
patterns of oxidative stress related to alcohol use (frequency) and alcohol misuse (quantity, e.g., binge
drinking) as indicators of health. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: (1) Characterize longitudinal
changes of oxidative stress via 8-Isoprostane over 3 years by sociodemographic characteristics (sexual
orientation/identity, sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) among sexual minority young adults. (2)
Describe longitudinal associations between alcohol use, alcohol misuse, and 8-Isoprostane over 3-years
among sexual minority young adults. (3) Determine whether associations between alcohol use, alcohol misuse,
and 8-Isoprostane over 3 years differ by sociodemographic characteristics (sexual orientation/identity, sex,
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status). To test these aims, I propose sophisticated quantitative methodology
including parallel latent growth curve analyses which are rarely used to examine longitudinal associations
between alcohol use and misuse and oxidative stress among sexual minority young adults. The proposed
research will help to determine whether specific subgroups of sexual minority young adults are at greatest risk
for immediate care and support. With the mentorship of Dr. Rebecca Evans-Polce and Dr. Sean Esteban
McCabe, this diversity supplement training will allow me to: (1) expand my knowledge in the impacts of alcohol
use and alcohol misuse on biological processes among diverse sexual minorities across young adulthood, (2)
become proficient in analyzing large nationally representative longitudinal data, (3) and improve my grant
writing skills. The training acquired through this diversity supplement will position me to obtain my long-term
career objective of becoming a leader in NIH-funded research on the associations among minority stressors,
alcohol misuse, and other behavioral problems, and biological stress processes as determinants of health
among diverse sexual minority populations."

Southcentral Foundation (SCF) is a successful Tribally-owned and -operated healthcare organization in southcentral Alaska, a region spanning 104,713 square miles, 55 rural villages, and serving 70,000 ANAI peoples representing 229 federally-recognized tribes. In 2018, SCF completed a community health needs assessment (CHNA) with the intention to improve existing services and develop new programs. The CHNA included quantitative and qualitative methods to gather cross-sectional information about the health needs of the AN/AI peoples served by SCF to assess performance and identify any gaps across seven domains (manuscript in preparation). Participants included healthcare system leadership, staff, and customer-owners.
Two of the top three health needs identified through the CHNA were substance use (alcohol,
drug, and tobacco misuse) and behavioral health. More specifically, participants reported needs for more prevention, addiction awareness, and both short-term and long-term treatment for SUD. Behavioral health needs included increased access to services, expanded treatment for behavioral health issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) and suicide prevention, awareness, and support. Since these results were shared with SCF key stakeholders, leadership has made significant efforts to improve access to services and address some of the needs identified by CHNA participants. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the use of telemedicine for all services, there is a need to engage the AN/AI community served by SCF to better understand whether attempts to improve access and address the specified needs have been met, or if additional needs been identified since the pandemic.
The goal of the proposed project is to complete a CHNA focused on substance use treatment services offered to SCF customer-owners, both urban and rural. While the literature suggest that co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders can impact service utilization, and this is a component of interest of the investigative team, the design and scope of this CHNA will be established in collaboration with the proposed project’s steering committee. Our Specific Aims are to:
1.	Assess the needs for substance use treatment services at Southcentral
Foundation. This will be achieved through 20 interviews with clinicians and leadership, 250 customer-owner surveys, and 4 focus groups with rural clinics and one community- based treatment program external to SCF.
2.	Build capacity of one Alaska Native investigator (Ms. Aliassa Shane) with ongoing mentorship by local and academic investigators with expertise in substance use disorders. This will be achieved through monthly mentoring meetings, annual
attendance at one professional conference, and one training focused on development of substance use disorder or indigenous methods.
3.	Draft health system recommendations and conceptual framework for a Phase II study. This will be achieved through a report and meetings with the steering committee for Southcentral Foundation leadership.
These aims will contribute to the limited knowledge about effective treatment and recovery services among AN/AI peoples in a real-world environment. These activities have potential applicability in other tribal health systems across the nation and other health systems that seek to provide culturally grounded treatment and recovery services."

We propose a coordinating center that brings together experts and stakeholders to identify exposome research
priorities, develop harmonized exposome measures based on those priorities, and establish guidance and best
practices for use of exposome data to advance the science of AD/ADRD risk, resilience, and disparities.
Leveraging and building upon the expertise gained from the successful development and expansion of the
Gateway to Global Aging Data (the Gateway) platform, we propose to establish a research coordinating center,
the Gateway Exposome Coordinating Center (GECC) for AD/ADRD Research. Given the wide diversity in
exposures that occur over the life course, there is a critical need to facilitate discussions, engagements, and
collaborations between researchers and stakeholders across many disciplines to create a central source of
measures, guidance, and tools for the scientific community working on AD/ADRD outcomes.
 We propose the GECC to build consensus inclusively and transparently among experts and key
stakeholders around six key, interconnected domains: Climate, Physical Environment, Social Environment,
Policies, Community Services, and Life Experiences. The GECC will serve as a centralized hub for identifying
and setting priorities, reaching consensus, and establishing guidance on accessing, developing, harmonizing,
and sharing innovative exposome measures and data for the broader AD/ADRD research and stakeholder
community. We will do this by (1) identifying key experts and stakeholders across disciplines within each
domain, (2) organizing those experts and stakeholders through activities aimed at identifying key exposome
measures and creating consensus around their prioritization and definition and, when lacking consensus,
supporting research to facilitate consensus, (3) promoting within and cross-domain engagements to inspire
innovation, understanding, the creation of common measurements, and collaborations, and (4) disseminating
data, findings, and guidance from the GECC’s activities so that they can be used by the broader community
and establish a published record of our decision-making and inform future generations of researchers.
 In addition to leading the development of exposure measures, the GECC will also promote and support
others in developing and harmonizing exposome data, including NIA-supported infrastructure projects, center
and network programs and other interested researchers and projects. This support will come through
publishing detailed guidance documents, organizing capacity-building workshops, and the GECC’s pilot
program. The GECC will further encourage innovations and participation from the broader scientific community
through publications, research briefs, webinars, hackathons, exhibits, and social media, as well as the Center’s
in-person and virtual workshops. Collectively, the activities of the GECC to establish consensus around core
and innovative exposome measures and promote their harmonization and development for broad use will
enable and accelerate AD/ADRD research across disciplines."

Tumor suppressor p53 is the quintessential guardian of the genome whose function is inhibited in greater than
50% of all human cancers. Though mutation and deletion of p53 are major contributors to p53 inactivation,
overexpression of the negative regulators MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX) are also known to inactivate p53, thus
leading to the cancer phenotype. Our lab has shown that specific types of cell stress initiate the generation of
an alternatively spliced isoform of MDM2. The predominant MDM2 alternative isoform, MDM2-ALT1 also
known as MDM2-B, functions to primarily activate the p53 pathway by inhibiting MDM2 and MDM4 in a
dominant negative fashion. Paradoxically, this isoform is upregulated in several human cancers, such as
pediatric high-grade gliomas, astrocytomas, rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), and liposarcomas, as well as adult
cancers such as lymphomas and those of the breast. Thus, MDM2-ALT1 plays opposing roles in cancer
progression dependent upon the context of its expression. In the proposed research, we will study the
underpinnings of the control of the p53 pathway by MDM2-ALT1 to better understand 1) the specific
mechanism by which that MDM2-ALT1 is generated in cancer and 2) the ability of the resultant isoforms to be
targeted using splice-switching oligonucleotides. We hypothesize that the expression of oncogenic MDM2-
ALT1 is modulated by alterations in protein and RNA nuclear factors during the progression to tumorigenesis
and can be targeted to induce splicing changes. We will use assays that identify and measure splice regulation
in conjunction with gene editing approaches to identify RNA sequences and their respective nuclear factor-
binding partners necessary for regulation of MDM2 splicing. Furthermore, we will use novel genetically
engineered mouse models as well as established mouse xenograft assays and novel splice switching
oligonucleotides (SSOs) to modulate MDM2 isoform levels. Our work will broaden our knowledge of
combinatorial regulation of RNA processing in response to stress and in cancer and interrogate the utility of
MDM2 isoforms modulation for rational control of the p53 pathway."

Genetically modified mouse models of breast cancer have been used for decades as premier basic
science tools for mechanistic discovery. However, the successful implementation of mouse models as
surrogates of therapeutic efficacy and translational research has been challenging. One major challenge
for status quo approaches is their limited ability to model the genetic heterogeneity observed in breast
cancers. Metastatic and treatment resistant HER2+ breast cancers are incurable largely due to this
heterogeneity, the source of which may stem from the competition and evolution of multiple oncogenic
isoforms of the driver gene HER2. The objective for this proposal is to recapitulate the genetic
heterogeneity of HER2 oncogenes in a genetically tractable model more closely resembling the human
condition – including an intact immune system and stromal network. Published preliminary data
recently described a Cancer rainbow (Crainbow) modeling system for fluorescently barcoding and
expressing multiple tumor driver genes in a single immune intact mouse. The fluorescent barcode is
retrieved by multispectral imaging and single-cell “omics” techniques providing a simple solution for
inducing intratumor heterogeneity and visualizing its evolution. Any tumor driver gene can be
incorporated into Crainbow mice. Therefore, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that
modeling the oncogenic heterogeneity of HER2 in a Cancer rainbow mouse
recapitulates the phenotypic heterogeneity found in treatment resistant and metastatic
HER2+ breast cancers. The central hypothesis will be tested by completing four specific aims
seeking to: (Aim 1) Validate a HER2 Crainbow mouse model of tumor heterogeneity, (Aim 2)
Demonstrate heterogeneity within the tumor epithelium, (Aim 3) Demonstrate heterogeneity of the
tumor microenvironment and its contribution to tumor biology, and (Aim 4) Demonstrate
heterogeneity and differential response to therapy. HER2 Crainbow mice will provide an autochthonous
mouse model of the genetic heterogeneity found in HER2+ breast cancer, all while maintaining the
endogenous contributions of the tumor microenvironment to invasion and metastasis. Completing this
proposal is expected to validate the HER2 Crainbow mouse as a shareable resource strain for more
predictive preclinical trials and a framework for illuminating the molecular and cellular ontogeny of
invasive breast cancer."

Community research samples reveal near parity in the ratio of boys to girls who meet criteria for developmental
language disorder (DLD); however, in 2020-21, US school SLPs served twice as many boys as girls. Our primary
goal is to determine why girls are less likely to receive language services than boys, a goal perfectly aligned with
and highly responsive to 1) NIH's Interest in Diversity (NOT-OD-20-031), 2) the focus of the NIDCD Strategic
Plan on projects to improve women’s health, and 3) the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Encouraging Women’s
Health Research within the NIDCD Mission Areas (NOT-DC-23-006). The service gap could reflect legitimate
differences in need: Their tendency to demonstrate high effortful control may enable girls to stave off the disabling
consequences of language impairment such that fewer girls need services, or they need later or different services
than boys. Alternatively, the gap could reflect inequities in access to health care. The gendered beliefs and
practices that characterize families, communities, and societal institutions may encourage masking, lessen
concerns about girls, or heighten concerns about boys. These hypotheses are tested via four specific aims.
Aim 1: To determine the extent to which disability drives service receipt and whether this relationship varies by
gender. We will mine a database of academic records and use generalized linear mixed models and regression
to compare boys and girls in receipt, timing, and type of service relative to their needs.
Aim 2: To explain the relationship between language disability and temperament and determine whether this
relationship varies by gender. We will use a sequential explanatory design. In Phase 1, we will use regression
models to determine whether girls are less or differently disabled than boys, and whether the extent of disability
relates to effortful control. In Phase 2, we will interview children and parents to probe the role of high effortful
control and other aspects of temperament as compensatory mechanisms.
Aim 3: To determine the extent to which child internalizing behavior and child and caretaker gender bias affect
service receipt and whether these relationships vary by gender. We will use a sequential explanatory design. In
Phase 1, we will use regression models to determine whether child internalization and gender bias are associated
with delayed services for girls. In Phase 2, we will interview parents to document their initial concerns about their
child’s language development, the timing between initial concern and help-seeking, and the role of internalization
and other potential masking behaviors on the part of boys and girls in motivating or discouraging help-seeking.
Aim 4: To determine the extent to which professionals differentiate the language-related needs of boys and girls
and whether gender bias predicts differentiation. We will use an exploratory sequential design. In Phase 1, we
will conduct focus groups to document professionals’ observations of language function in boys vs. girls and their
gendered expectations that affect service decisions. In Phase 2, we will conduct surveys to determine
generalization and relate gendered practices to an independent measure of gender bias via regression."

Our multidisciplinary team endeavors to address critical knowledge gaps regarding the impact of type 1 diabetes
(T1D) on neurocognitive outcomes among a diverse population of children. Throughout the study, our team will
observe factors that contribute to neurocognitive outcomes, such as nutritional and lifestyle behaviors,
environmental exposures, and social determinants of health (SDOH). We will also explore the potential protective
effects of diabetes management technologies, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated
insulin delivery systems, to promote better neurocognitive outcomes for these children. The cooperative
agreement’s overarching goals are to establish a clinical consortium comprised of a pre-pubertal diverse cohort
of children with newly diagnosed T1D to evaluate the impact of T1D on neurocognitive function and to identify
potential clinical and environmental risk and protective factors associated with neurocognitive function in T1D.
The project’s board led by Drs. Page, Raymond, and Xiang, demonstrate their commitment to scientific
development and the execution of a nationwide consortium by proposing to serve as one of the 10 Clinical
Centers operating within the proposed NIDDK consortium to recruit and track a nationally diverse cohort
(estimate = 1000 children) representing the pediatric population of patients with T1D. Therefore, our project’s
board and multidisciplinary team will leverage our recruitment sites at both Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and
Kaiser Permanente Southern California to enroll 100 participants (5-11y); 50 with newly diagnosed T1D and 50
age, gender, and race/ethnicity matched controls for this longitudinal study. The team will monitor: glycemic
control (CGM metrics and hemoglobin A1c); lifestyle (diet, sleep, and physical activity); environmental exposures
and SDOH; brain development; and neurocognitive and neuropsychological outcomes. Our team will partner
with the Steering Committee to establish our long-term objectives to harmonize methods and develop an optimal
protocol for collecting and storing plasma, urine, and stool samples to create a biobank for future biomarker
investigations that predict neurocognitive outcomes in children with T1D. The team’s three specific aims are to
first identify the effects of glycemic control on neurocognitive outcomes in children ages 5-11 with a new T1D
diagnosis, second to determine the impact and neurocognitive outcomes in children with T1D concerning
children’s diet, sleep, physical activity, obesity, environmental exposures, and SDOH, and third to perform an
integrated analysis to identify subgroups of children with T1D at an increased risk for adverse neurocognitive
outcomes, including the influence of sex, race/ethnicity, lifestyle, and SDOH."

Postmortem studies indicate that synaptic pruning continues through adolescence into adulthood in prefrontal
cortex (PFC) at time when cognitive abilities optimize and major psychopathologies (e.g., schizophrenia, mood
disorders, substance use disorders) emerge. However, understanding this process in vivo and its effects on
maturation of neurocognitive function is not well understood. The recently funded parent R01 proposes a suite
of MR-based acquisitions to assess synaptic pruning in vivo using ultra high field (7 Tesla) 31P MRI, diffusion
weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). This competing supplement aims to extend this
work in two aims. First, we will add critical direct characterizations of synaptic pruning from a subset of adult
participants from the parent grant using the tracer [11C]UCB-J which has been well validated as the gold
standard in vivo measure of synapse density. Regional and whole-brain analyses will characterize the
relationship between MR and PET-based measures of synaptic density to demonstrate how MRI can be used to
assess developmental synapse reduction. Second, we will use EEG data collected from all the participants of
the parent grant to understand how PFC synaptic pruning supports neurocognitive maturation via development
of electrophysiological properties of functional brain activity. Adolescent pruning of excitatory synapses has been
proposed as a mechanism for optimizing cortical signal processing, driving the rebalancing of excitatory-
inhibitory (E/I) signaling associated with adolescent brain plasticity. Interactions among these neural signaling
systems support the development of oscillatory activity, suppression of spontaneous neural firing, and
enhancement of cortical signal-to-noise ratios, which together support the emergence of adult levels of reliable
cognitive processing. EEG data will be used to assess both periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic (non-cyclical)
activity, to characterize how synaptic pruning reshapes these aspects of neural signal processing through
adolescence. This study will not only increase the impact of our ongoing studies, but importantly will provide a
first-ever comprehensive assessment of how reliable, accessible measurements of synaptic pruning can be used
to assess cortical signal processing. This will have a wide ranging impact in stimulating research related to
synaptic pruning across disciplines: pruning has been linked to a number of mental health and
neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and more. Providing
the field with validated tools to better assess these processes in vivo using accessible methodologies such as
MRI and EEG, in conjunction with the results emerging from the proposed studies characterizing adolescent
neurodevelopment, will advance our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms driving plasticity
through this critical period, and how disruptions to these processes confer risk for the emergence of
psychopathology."

Alterations in the availability, potency, or composition of illicit drugs can lead to shifts in drug use behaviors and
drug-related morbidity and mortality. Such changes can expose individuals to new risks, potentially increasing
the likelihood of infection. In recent years, Xylazine, also known as ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope"" or ""anestesia de
caballo,"" has significantly affected people who inject drugs (PWID). Xylazine, a phenothiazine, induces sedation,
giving users a false perception of prolonged fentanyl effects. Xylazine has several adverse effects, including
severe infections, skin ulceration, and prolonged sedation. However, little is known about how xylazine
contributes to increased rates of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) among PWID. The possible
explanations are allergic reactions to drug adulterants and other drug excipients or xylazine-driven
vasoconstriction leading to decreased blood flow into the tissue leading to necrosis followed by skin infections.
While there is a strong understanding of factors that are protective against SSTI, additional research is needed
to understand if harm reduction measures such as use of clean syringes, good hygiene and stable housing are
protective in the context of xylazine exposure. Additional challenges exist in measuring the exposure to xylazine.
While tests that can identify xylazine and its metabolites in urine, drug paraphernalia, and drug samples, a single
test cannot provide an accurate estimate of xylazine exposure as the drug supply is constantly changing.
Therefore, there is a critical need to develop testing regimens to assess time varying exposures to xylazine and
to then use the exposure data to better assess associations between xylazine exposure and SSTI incidence. We
propose to prospectively recruit 200 PWID from Lowell, Massachusetts and follow them for a period of three
months, quantifying exposure to xylazine and other drugs and measuring the incidence of SSTI. We will examine
xylazine exposure among PWID using a combination of laboratory assessment, xylazine test strips, and urine
analysis at multiple timepoints. We will then examine the incidence of SSTI among PWID in the study and
determine the increased risk associated with xylazine use. In addition, we will use a qualitative research
framework interviewing 15 PWID who develop SSTI and additional 15 PWID who do not develop SSTI to better
understand the context surrounding SSTI risk factors and manifestations, as well as PWID healthcare interests,
experiences, and challenges following SSTI. Our proposed mixed methods study will help identify the best
assessments of exposure to xylazine and more precise associations between xylazine exposure and SSTI
incidence, while also elucidating moderating and mediating risk factors."

OCHIN’s CHCs, to support future interventions using these data. (3) Widely disseminate and translate findings
both within and beyond the CCHRC’s Learning Community to inform the action-oriented spread of new
knowledge to diverse stakeholders and target audiences. (4) Rigorously evaluate the progress of the CCHRC
planning process in meeting its goals and objectives, regularly update CCHRC leaders and funders on
evaluation findings, and adapt processes as necessary. By completing these tasks, the Administrative Core will
optimize the CCHRC’s ability to generate a much-needed long-term body of research on the mitigation of
climate-induced health impacts in the marginalized U.S. populations served by primary care CHCs."

The UCSF Discovering cancer Risks from Environmental contaminants And Maternal/child health
(DREAM) cohort will enhance our understanding of how multiple exposures to environmental chemicals and
pollutants across a diverse population of pregnant women and their offspring are linked to cancer risks. We will
enroll and follow an economically, geographically, ethnically, and racially diverse participant pool of pregnant
women and their children in the San Francisco Bay Area and California’s Central Valley. Because pregnancy
induces multiple maternal hormonal and physiological changes that can increase cancer susceptibility to
environmental chemical exposures, we will focus on pregnancy as a period of particular vulnerability to toxic
agents. We will collect questionnaire data and biospecimen samples starting at the second trimester of
pregnancy up until the child reaches four years of age. We will also establish a Cohort Ambassador Program to
invite participants across our three sites to provide continuous feedback which we will integrate into our research
priorities. Our specific aims are designed to address the hypothesis that exposures to environmental chemicals
that disrupt endocrine and other systems during this important life phase predispose women and children to
cancer, as identified via intermediate cancer risk biomarkers. Our environmental exposures will focus on two
major components: Consumer product related chemicals (including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS],
phthalates and plasticizers, phenolic compounds, pesticides, and aromatic amines) measured via biomonitoring
and prioritized based on widespread public exposure; and environmental pollutants in air and water, evaluated
via geographic information system analyses of participants’ residential histories. Our outcomes will focus on
biomarkers of risk for future cancer incidence including: short-term outcomes focusing on associations with key
characteristics that are intermediate cancer risk biomarkers (immune response and chronic inflammation,
oxidative stress and DNA damage, hormone disruption/receptor mediated effects, and cell immortalization). For
longer term outcomes we will link cohort participants to California’s statewide population-based cancer registry,
hospital discharge data, vital records, and Medi-Cal files in later years of the project to identify diagnoses of
cancer and related conditions. Our multidisciplinary collaboration is built on our extensive knowledge and
experience conducting large-scale research on environmental exposures during pregnancy and environmental
risk factors for cancer. Our proposed cohort development and research plan will advance our understanding of
multiple pollutant exposures in a young geographically and demographically diverse cohort, thus substantially
advancing our knowledge on enhanced susceptibility to carcinogens linked to specific outcomes during these
critical and understudied periods, combined with a platform that will allow flexibility and future collaboration to
enhance our study as new science emerges."

Genetically modified mouse models of breast cancer have been used for decades as premier basic
science tools for mechanistic discovery. However, the successful implementation of mouse models as
surrogates of therapeutic efficacy and translational research has been challenging. One major challenge
for status quo approaches is their limited ability to model the genetic heterogeneity observed in breast
cancers. Metastatic and treatment resistant HER2+ breast cancers are incurable largely due to this
heterogeneity, the source of which may stem from the competition and evolution of multiple oncogenic
isoforms of the driver gene HER2. The objective for this proposal is to recapitulate the genetic
heterogeneity of HER2 oncogenes in a genetically tractable model more closely resembling the human
condition – including an intact immune system and stromal network. Published preliminary data
recently described a Cancer rainbow (Crainbow) modeling system for fluorescently barcoding and
expressing multiple tumor driver genes in a single immune intact mouse. The fluorescent barcode is
retrieved by multispectral imaging and single-cell “omics” techniques providing a simple solution for
inducing intratumor heterogeneity and visualizing its evolution. Any tumor driver gene can be
incorporated into Crainbow mice. Therefore, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that
modeling the oncogenic heterogeneity of HER2 in a Cancer rainbow mouse
recapitulates the phenotypic heterogeneity found in treatment resistant and metastatic
HER2+ breast cancers. The central hypothesis will be tested by completing four specific aims
seeking to: (Aim 1) Validate a HER2 Crainbow mouse model of tumor heterogeneity, (Aim 2)
Demonstrate heterogeneity within the tumor epithelium, (Aim 3) Demonstrate heterogeneity of the
tumor microenvironment and its contribution to tumor biology, and (Aim 4) Demonstrate
heterogeneity and differential response to therapy. HER2 Crainbow mice will provide an autochthonous
mouse model of the genetic heterogeneity found in HER2+ breast cancer, all while maintaining the
endogenous contributions of the tumor microenvironment to invasion and metastasis. Completing this
proposal is expected to validate the HER2 Crainbow mouse as a shareable resource strain for more
predictive preclinical trials and a framework for illuminating the molecular and cellular ontogeny of
invasive breast cancer."

Despite advances in treatment, such as targeted and immune therapies, lung cancer remains a deadly
malignancy with five-year survival below 25%. About two-thirds of NSCLC diagnoses are made in former
tobacco smokers, who are at 6-fold higher risk for the disease compared to non-smokers. Unfortunately,
attempts to identify chemopreventive agents that reduce the risk of cancer in ex-smokers have been
unsuccessful. Currently in the US, about 60% of ex-smokers are either overweight or obese. We have
observed that for lung cancer, the well-known anti-cancer effect of the common diabetes drug metformin is
restricted to patients who are overweight or obese. In investigations that followed this novel finding, we have
found that in both humans and mice, obesity is associated with changes in the lung tumor immune
microenvironment that promote disease progression, and that these changes are susceptible to reversal by
metformin. Prominent among these changes is the impact of metformin on activation of immunosuppressive
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which is known to be an important immunological event in carcinogenesis. We
hypothesize that the obesity-specific immunomodulatory action of metformin also occurs in obese/overweight
ex-smokers at high risk of lung cancer. If true, this concept will establish a basis for metformin's
chemopreventive potential to abate lung cancer development in a major fraction of the population at high risk
for the cancer. To examine this preventive potential of metformin, we will conduct a small phase II trial with at-
high-risk obese/overweight subjects to establish that months-long oral metformin treatment diminishes markers
of immunosuppressive Tregs in lungs and enhances markers local pulmonary and systemic
immunosurveillance activity (Specific Aim 1). To identify mechanisms that underlie the obesity-specific
immunomodulatory effects of metformin, we will study the impact of this drug in obese and non-obese mice of
two distinct but complementary mouse lung cancer models (Specific Aim 2)."

 PARP inhibitor (PARPi) use in the clinic is expanding into multiple cancer types, and consequently,
PARPi resistance is a growing clinical problem. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tumors and cells
remain an optimal model system to assess PARPi response and resistance. We have developed a panel of
unique isogenic PARPi sensitive and resistance HGSOC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models. We published that hyperactivation of the Wnt/-catenin pathway promotes PARPi resistance. Through
the current literature and our preliminary investigation, we have discovered that Wnt-mediated PARPi resistant
HGSOC cells have increased expression of the immune checkpoint, PD-L1, and reduced expression of the
tumor suppressor, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Further, Wnt/-catenin signaling directly inhibits
effector T cell differentiation and promotes a tumor-promoting, M2-like macrophage. We will continue to
collaborate with MD2 Biosciences to investigate a first-in-class allosteric -catenin inhibitor, 1525. We
hypothesize that Wnt-dependent PARPi resistance inhibits anti-tumor immunity, and combining ICB with Wnt
inhibition will promote immune activation to eradicate PARPi resistant HGSOC. We are proposing to use
both in vitro and in vivo models to determine the role of PARPi resistance and Wnt signaling in promoting an
immune-suppressive environment. In Aim 1, we will use our unique PARPi resistant cell line models to
establish -catenin regulation of PD-L1 (gene – CD274) and IRF1. In Aim 2, we will determine whether
secreted factors from PARPi resistant cells attenuates T cell activation and promotes macrophage M2
differentiation. In Aim 3, we will use our novel syngeneic and humanized mouse models to assess the 1525 -
catenin inhibitor combined with anti-PD-1. The proposed work has the potential for a high impact on
understanding ovarian cancer biology and improving therapeutic options. We anticipate combining -catenin
inhibition with an immune checkpoint blocker will overcome PARPi resistance and provide a therapeutic option
for those who are no longer responding to PARP inhibitors. Thus, the proposed work's long-term goal is to
develop an investigator-initiated clinical trial at the University of Colorado."

Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH)
represent a major cause of liver disease morbidity and mortality. The NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH
CRN) has been sponsored by the NIDDK since 2002 and is an international leader in clinical studies in MASH.
The overarching objective of this application is to pursue clinical and translational research in MASH that will
ultimately lead to improvement in the management of patients with MAFLD and MASH. There remains a need
to understand the burden of liver disease and other causes of morbidity and mortality in MASH. New medications
for adults with MASH are currently in clinical trials but no therapies are currently in development for children.
Thus, there is a need for the NASH CRN to continue our leadership in describing the natural history of MASLD
and MASH and to continue our pioneering work in design and implementation of clinical trials for MASH. This
application is for the continuation of the Seattle Clinical Center of the NASH CRN, which has been part of the
NASH CRN since its founding in 2002 and represents a large geographic area with a unique patient population.
Several specific aims are proposed that will advance the objectives of the NASH CRN during the next period of
funding. We will complete enrollment and follow up of MASLD and MASH patients in the adult and pediatric
Database study and VEDS clinical trial. We will focus the latter part of the final 3-year period completing data
analyses and publishing high-impact papers. The PI and Seattle Clinical Center have been leaders in the NASH

 Several studies have reported that hemoglobin is expressed in neurons in the rodent and human
brain, however the function of hemoglobin in these cells hasn't been clearly defined. The long term goal
of this research is to better understand why hemoglobin is expressed in cells other than red blood cells.
The hemoglobin  and  subunits (Hba and Hbb) are expressed in neurons in the brain, but only Hbb is
localized to the nucleus. In this proposal our objective is to understand why Hbb is expressed in the
nucleus and to uncover mechanisms involved in Hbb signaling. We have found that Hbb interacts with
chromatin where it inhibits the activity of the KDM5B histone demethylase by sequestering oxygen
required for KDM5B activity. Hbb mediated inhibition of KDM5B results in increased levels of H3K4me3,
a histone mark that activates transcription. The aims of this proposal will test the hypothesis: that
Hbb regulates chromatin and transcription in the brain to adapt to metabolic demands. In aim 1: ChIP-
seq will be employed to find out where Hbb is bound to chromatin and which genes are regulated by Hbb
signaling in primary neuronal cultures. In aim 2: Effects of Hbb on bioenergetics will be assessed with
Seahorse respirometry. Aim 3: will test the role of exercise on regulation of Hbb signaling pathways and
energy metabolism in the brain. The proposed study will increase the understanding of mechanisms
involved in regulating the chromatin landscape and gene expression related to balancing energy
metabolism needs."
10977154,"This application proposes the addition of data collection and hypotheses for the parent R01 in support of the
training of a very promising graduate student from an under-represented background. Using data from a
completed pilot study in individuals with emotion dysregulation, our team has shown that task-based functional
activity and connectivity in the insula are associated with induction of negative emotion, utilization of emotion
regulation skills, and emotion dysregulation severity. In a comparison group of non-clinical participants,
utilization of emotion regulation skills was associated with increased functional connectivity strength between
the insula and the mPFC, a default mode network node. These findings suggest that dynamics between the
salience and other large-scale prefrontal networks differ between emotionally dysregulated and non-clinical
participants. Therefore, the supplement plans to examine the hypothesis that cortico-insular connections are
critically involved in emotion dysregulation and may be a mechanism for the therapeutic response to
neuromodulatory perturbation. Ms. Gerlus is planning to learn and employ a connectomic approach to
determine how cortico-insular connectivity is related to emotion dysregulation and affected by brain stimulation.
The skills and training proposed would allow her to establish the foundation for a physician-scientist career at
the intersection of psychiatry and neuroscience and would serve as the basis for her dissertation."
10977285,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer is a global scourge responsible for ~1.5 million deaths worldwide, and ~130,000 deaths in the
USA in 2022. Despite our understanding of relevant risk factors such as cigarettes, asbestos and radon, lung
cancer kills more US citizens than the next four cancer types combined. Although the clinical situation is
challenging, fundamental cancer research has revealed that lung cancers can be subdivided into genetically-
defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical
deployment of FDA-approved pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. In particular, FDA approval
of oncoprotein-targeted therapies such sotorasib or dabrafenib plus trametinib as treatments for KRASG12C or
BRAFV600E-driven lung cancer respectively are already having an important impact on patients with these subsets
of the disease. However, despite this, and recent advances in the deployment of immunotherapy, only a minority
of lung cancer patients have benefitted from such advances such that treatment options for many patients remain
limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are
ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to the patient. Consequently, the overarching, long-term goal of this
research is to provide a rational scientific foundation for the development of new combination therapeutic
strategies to treat patients with KRAS- or BRAF-driven lung cancer that: 1. Increase the overall response rate
and depth of each patient's primary response; 2. Maximize safety and tolerability, while minimizing toxicity and;
3. Forestall the onset of lethal drug resistance. To that end, our short-term aims are to elucidate how various
signaling pathways cooperate with oncogenic KRAS or BRAF in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer.
To do so we will leverage: 1. State-of-the-art preclinical mouse models (GEM or PDX) of KRAS- or BRAF-driven
lung cancer; 2. Human or mouse lung cancer-derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant
genetic abnormalities; 3. Pathway-targeted inhibitors, many of which are FDA-approved or in clinical
development and; 4. An outstanding collaborative team of scientists and physicians who will consult on the
design, execution and interpretation of the results of our research. Hence, building on a solid foundation of
published or preliminary data, we will use models of KRAS- or BRAF-driven lung cancer to elucidate the role of:
1. Autocrine activation of ERBB/HER signaling as a mechanism that promotes lung cancer progression and
maintenance; 2. Autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism that protects lung cancer cells from the cytotoxic
effects of pathway-targeted inhibition and; 3. AKT protein kinases as progression factors or pharmacological
targets in the genesis or maintenance of lung cancer. Consequently, our research is significant and likely to
have lasting and important translational impact in the design and evaluation of new combination pathway-
targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease."
10977286,"1. ABSTRACT: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a dismal outcome; fewer than
20% of elderly patients and only 50-65% of pediatric patients are cured and survive more than 3 years following
diagnosis. Despite this, the standard therapy for AML treatment has relied primarily on an intensive combination of ara-
C, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) for over 40 years. Relapsed and resistant disease following treatment with
standard therapy (ADE: ara-C, daunorubicin, and etoposide) are the most common clinical failures that occur in
treating this disease. Application co-PIs, Drs. Lamba (pharmacology) and Pounds (biostatistician specializing in
cancer genomics) have successfully collaborated for over a decade to develop methods and discover molecular
prognostic factors for AML. During our recently completed second funding cycle, we were very productive with 13
scientific publications, 53 conference presentations, and two pending patents. Our second-cycle scientific
achievements include the development of an ara-C SNP score that predicts leukemic cell intracellular levels of ara-
CTP, the active form of ara-C the development of the innovative integrative analysis procedure; canonical
correlation with projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (CC-PROMISE), that dramatically increases
statistical power for meaningful biological discovery in a rare-disease small sample size setting; using CC-
PROMISE to discover that reduced methylation and increased expression of the DNMT3B associates with greater
genome-wide methylation burden and worse prognosis; translating the DNMT3B discovery into evaluation of
demethylating agents in the ongoing AML16 clinical trial; the development and initial validation of the six-gene
pediatric leukemia stem cell (pLSC6) score (patent pending) and five-gene ADE resistance score (ADE-RS5) score
that predict prognosis. In this renewal application, we propose to accelerate our exciting progress by extensively
validating the pLSC6 and ADE-RS5 scores to provide a robust scientific foundation to translate them into clinical
practice and further developing our understanding of the biological basis of AML development and prognosis into
other molecular domains. In the current proposal we seek to accelerate our exciting progress by extensively validating
the pLSC6 and ADE-RS5 scores in ~ 4000 patients across 10 independent national and international AML cohorts
treated on intensive chemotherapy, to provide a robust scientific foundation for its translation into clinical practice.
In aim 2, we propose to perform a clinical outcome-GWAS (CO-GWAS) and establish prognostic genes and variants
with a constellation of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features that associate with clinical outcomes which
will undergo thorough mechanistic validation in aim 2. The successful completion of these studies will be
scientifically and clinically significant by preparing a sound scientific rationale to incorporate prognostic gene
expression scores into the risk stratification of AML patients and revealing additional layers of the molecular basis
of AML prognosis to guide the development of more effective therapies."
10975873,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mammalian heart does not robustly regenerate after myocardial infarction and heals via a fibrotic repair
response. Scar tissue is non-contractile, increases the hemodynamic burden on the remaining cardiac muscle
and over time adverse cardiac remodeling occurs leading to ventricular dilatation and development of heart
failure. Understanding mechanisms of ventricular remodeling to redirect the cardiac injury response from a
fibrotic to a reparative one remains one of the broad therapeutic goals in cardiovascular medicine. We have
recently identified extracellular nucleotide metabolism as a novel target for cardiac remodeling after ischemic
cardiac injury. We demonstrated that after cardiac injury, the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 is upregulated and
hydrolyzes extracellular ATP into AMP. Increased AMP was converted into adenine and extracellular adenine
initiated a pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cascade that caused cell death by disrupting NAD and pyrimidine
biosynthesis in non-myocytes and myocytes. However the mechanisms of adenine generation and transport
across the cell membrane, molecular and biochemical mechanisms of downstream effects on NAD and
pyrimidine biosynthesis and whether the ENPP1/AMP/Adenine axis can be targeted for therapeutic gain to
attenuate post infarct cardiac remodeling are unknown. In this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team
comprising experts in cardiac physiology, metabolomics, computational biology, and finally population genetics
to investigate the role of adenine metabolism in cardiac remodeling, identify its relevance as a potential
therapeutic target and its association with human cardiomyopathy."
10976646,"Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who
are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive
deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are
among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation.
Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and
proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort
study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during
which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER
has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these
disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact,
and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS
disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an
agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric,
substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial
(BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new
therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.
 Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to
a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To
accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from
CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim
1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed
genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array)
and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will
include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates
more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to
those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary
data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the
need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease."

“Hybrid trial for alcohol reduction among people with TB and HIV in India (HATHI)”, we are funded to test a
behavioral alcohol reduction intervention that incorporates cognitive behavioral (CBT) and motivational
enhancement therapy (MET) among persons with tuberculosis (TB) and TB/HIV co-infection in Pune, India. We
have culturally adapted an evidence-based intervention and initiated recruitment in September 2022 at BJGMC
and Dr. D.Y Patil Medical College. We are recruiting people from both TB and HIV clinics. In our first ten
months of alcohol screening in HIV clinics with the AUDIT, 437 PWH met criteria for unhealthy alcohol use who
were not TB co-infected. Given that unhealthy alcohol use contributes to poor outcomes among PWH and is a
major barrier to global initiatives to end the HIV pandemic, excluding individuals with HIV only is a missed
opportunity to see if this evidence-based intervention can also improve outcomes among PWH only. In this
administrative supplement to HATHI, we propose to extend our inclusion criteria to PWH without TB. We will
recruit 150 PWH and unhealthy alcohol use from our two Pune HIV ART clinics. and randomize them to our
CBT/MET-based HATHI intervention or standard of care. The intervention consists of four counseling sessions
followed by three boosters, integrated into HIV care. Effectiveness outcomes measured at 3, 6 and 12 months
include 1) self-reported alcohol use and phosphatidyl ethanol, an alcohol biomarker, and 2) HIV clinical
outcomes (HIV RNA suppression and ART adherence). Using the RE-AIM implementation framework, we will
use mixed methods to assess barriers and facilitators to alcohol treatment integration in HIV clinical settings
and the incremental costs of this intervention strategy. This supplement provides an opportunity to examine
whether our adapted intervention will effectively reduce unhealthy alcohol use among PWH in India. We have
trained counselors in the intervention delivery, developed systems for fidelity monitoring, and developed our
database and procedures. Leveraging resources and infrastructure of HATHI through this supplement will
increase efficiency and if the intervention is effective, hasten broader implementation in HIV clinics in India and
provide much-needed evidence to inform local and global policy, as we seek to end the HIV epidemic."

Circadian rhythm and sleep disruptions are prevalent in nearly all psychiatry disorders including major
depression (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SZ). Each cell in the brain has its own molecular
clock which regulates the rhythmic expression of many different genes, allowing cells to maximize efficiency at
times of day in which they are most needed. Importantly, while the core clock does not change from cell to cell,
the genes that the clock regulates can be very different in each cell type and the timing in which genes peak can
also be highly variable, even with some cells having a completely opposite phases of gene expression. Previous
studies by our group and others have established that gene expression rhythms can be reliably measured in
human postmortem brain and that molecular rhythms are highly irregular or disrupted in subjects with psychiatric
disease. In the first funding cycle, we assessed molecular rhythms in tissue homogenates taken from specific
cortical and striatal regions in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP),
schizophrenia (SZ), or unaffected comparison subjects. Using mouse models, we also established that molecular
rhythms in these regions are important in the regulation of behavior. We also found that particular rhythmic
signatures are associated with features like psychosis independent of clinical diagnosis. In this next funding
cycle, we will dive deeper to determine the rhythmic signatures of individual cell types and how these work in
harmony with others around them to synchronize the brain. We will also determine how these rhythms differ in
subjects with MDD, BP, and SZ. We will perform additional analysis to determine if clinical features across
diagnosis are related to specific rhythmic patterns and assess ultradian and seasonal rhythms. We will focus on
one particular circuit, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc), since this
circuit is known to be important in the regulation of reward-related decision making, mood, impulsivity, and
motivation and compare these regions to the motor cortex. To determine the functional relevance of these
molecular rhythm changes in specific cell types we will use mouse models with cell-type specific manipulations
of the core molecular clock and rhythms in selected transcripts to determine the impact on both cellular activity
and behavior. Taken together, these studies will extend and expand the results obtained during the first funding
cycle to give us important insight into rhythm disruptions associated with major psychiatric disease."
10975099,"Summary
 Type I diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. Sequelae of pediatric T1D
include neurocognitive dysfunction in attention, psychomotor speed, mental efficiency, visual-motor skills,
memory, and learning possibly due to damage to posterior white matter tracts and associated gray matter
regions. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetic ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis, glucose control, diabetes
device use, sleep, and caregiver distress may be important factors that influence neurocognitive development.
However, there is minimal data in this area and existing studies are limited by small sample size, short
follow-up time, and a lack of diversity in patient populations. A contemporary, adequately powered longitudinal
study in a diverse cohort of prepubescent children is needed to understand the mechanisms associated with
neurocognitive perturbations, critical periods for prevention and intervention, and strategies to mitigate the risk
of neurocognitive complications in later life.
 Our research team is uniquely qualified to serve as the Biostatistics Research Center (BRC) for the
Understanding Neurocognition in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes (UNYT1D) nation-wide consortium combining
extensive experience in the coordination of multi-site clinical studies and research networks, biostatistics
expertise in the analysis of complex observational data, and expertise in T1D, glucose variability,
neurocognition, and neuroimaging. Our application leverages the existing infrastructure of the University of
Minnesota’s Coordinating Centers for Biometric Research (CCBR), which has internationally recognized
expertise in coordinating complex, large-scale, multi-site studies and networks and over 50 years of experience
These substantial strengths enable the BRC to accomplish the following specific aims:1) Partner with NIDDK to
provide scientific leadership in the design of a longitudinal cohort study to characterize the neurocognitive
impact of new onset T1D in pre-pubertal children; 2) Provide overall coordination of the national multisite
consortium in the planning and implementation of and adherence to the protocol; 3) Provide consortium-wide
resources for data harmonization, pipelines, management and sharing; 4) Provide expertise in all aspects of
study reporting, data analysis and dissemination.
 The BRC will play a crucial role in the success of the consortium. Our research team has a proven
track-record of high-impact research in the clinical management of T1D, a history of developing novel
approaches to neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis, and extensive experience coordinating the
activities of and providing statistical and data management support for multi-site clinical studies and research
networks. Leveraging this experience and capitalizing on the existing infrastructure of the CCBR, we are
uniquely suited to serve as the BRC and support high-quality, robust, and reproducible research through the
UNYT1D consortium."
10977025,"Summary. Community health centers (CHCs) have unparalleled expertise in addressing health disparities in
marginalized U.S. communities, which have inequitably high vulnerabilities to the health impacts of climate
change. As the front line of primary care for these communities, CHCs are uniquely positioned to intervene to
prepare for and mitigate climate-induced health impacts in these populations. To do so effectively, CHCs must
be equipped with evidence regarding interventions that are successful in their patient populations. A crucial
first step is learning specifically how extreme climate events impact CHC patients’ health. The Research
Program Core of the Community Catalyst CCHRC will generate this critical knowledge by assessing
associations between climate-induced extreme heat events and wildfire-related poor air quality events and
health outcomes in CHC populations, with a focus on hypertension and asthma as prevalent diseases
managed in CHCs. The analyses will also consider the multi-level factors that may modify these associations.
These analyses will use 2013-2023 data from an EHR shared by a >1,700 CHC network spanning 36 states,
linked to granular climate event data. Working in bidirectional collaboration with the CHC community partners
in the CCHRC’s Community Engagement Core to ensure that analyses generate evidence that meets
community needs, we will test the hypotheses that: (1) Patients exposed to climate events will have an
increased incidence of elevated blood pressure, with an additive effect if exposed to both heat and poor air
quality, and a larger effect among patients with hypertension pre-event; there will also be increased incidence
of hypertension, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases among patients at risk for hypertension pre-event. (2)
Persons with asthma who are exposed to climate events will experience increased asthma exacerbation; there
will also be an increased incidence of asthma among exposed patients. Directed by our community partners,
we will build on these analyses’ results to (3) examine potential effect modifiers such as regional
characteristics and patient-level social risks and comorbidities, to enable identifying strategies that CHCs might
enact to prepare for and mitigate climate-induced health impacts, which will be assessed in future
effectiveness research. The analyses conducted here will provide the foundational evidence needed to develop
this community-prioritized research agenda."
10977360,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major clinical challenge. Although androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) is effective in treating PCa, majority of the patients quickly develop resistance to therapy and the tumor
relapses as hormone refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Men with CRPC frequently
progress to an aggressive lethal disease that metastasizes to bones and other visceral organs accounting for
high morbidity and mortality. Transcriptional activation of steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2; also known as
NCOA2/TIF2/GRIP1) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PCa by driving a metabolic switch towards de
novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Although increased lipogenesis is a known hallmark of hormone refractory PCa
progression, it is less clear how mitochondrial enzymes communicate with nuclear receptor coregulators to
rapidly fuel and support fat biosynthesis. Our preliminary findings indicate that sustained activity of mitochondrial
aconitase (ACO2) enzyme is critical for regulating citrate synthesis. We found that acetylation of ACO2 is
essential for enzyme functions, which is negatively regulated by sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). In human prostate cancer
patients, SIRT3 expression is repressed and increased expression of SRC-2 with concomitant reduction of
SIRT3 was found to be a genetic hallmark in metastatic PCa. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the
transcriptional coregulator SRC-2 drives the nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory axis by repressing tumor
suppressor SIRT3 thus promoting prostate tumor survival and metastasis competence. So our objectives in this
proposal are (1) to investigate the mechanisms regulating sustained activation of mitochondrial ACO2 to promote
lipogenesis, (2) define the role of nuclear receptor coregulator SRC-2 regulating SIRT3 expression, and (3)
evaluate the impact of this nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory axis on prostate tumor survival and adaptation
leading to bone colonization and growth. Our study will uncover molecular links between mitochondrial
metabolism and transcriptional regulation that enables hormone refractory PCa adaptation, survival and
ultimately metastatic competency."
10975497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The medical and functional needs of nursing home residents impose a differential risk of morbidity and
mortality due to severe weather events, including hurricanes. A potential explanation for the increases
observed in adverse resident outcomes after hurricane exposure is inadequate compliance by nursing home
facilities to federal emergency preparedness standards; however, prior research has not rigorously evaluated
this association. Furthermore, nursing home characteristics, such as private versus not-for-profit or public
ownership, are known to affect resident outcomes, but the impact of ownership on emergency preparedness
and post-disaster outcomes is unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a retrospective cohort
study using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Institute (NOAA) to evaluate facility-level and resident outcomes as a function of exposure to
Hurricane Michael (2018) and administrative emergency preparedness. Within our analytic sample of 1,423
nursing homes, we have classified 317 nursing homes as exposed to Hurricane Michael. Evaluating the post-
disaster outcomes of 30-day all-cause mortality (primary), 30-day hospitalization, and 120-day functional
decline, we will use predictive modeling to identify which of the 250 federal emergency preparedness
deficiencies identified in CMS Life Safety Code inspections are most predictive of the facility-level rate of
adverse post-disaster outcomes (Aim 1). We hypothesize that deficiencies pertaining to evacuation and
sheltering preparedness will be included within this subset of “critical deficiencies.” In Aims 2 and 3, we will
construct a dichotomous measure of noncompliance from the subset of critical deficiencies identified in Aim 1
(i.e., a nursing home with ≥1 critical deficiencies will be classified as noncompliant). In Aim 2, we will evaluate
whether the impact of hurricane exposure on the resident-level likelihood of adverse post-disaster outcomes is
modified by noncompliance. We hypothesize that noncompliance will confer an increased risk of adverse post-
disaster resident outcomes. Lastly, we will assess whether private nursing home ownership is associated with
the resident-level likelihood of adverse post-disaster outcomes, and whether this potential association is
mediated by noncompliance (Aim 3). We hypothesize that residents from privately owned nursing homes will
have worse post-disaster outcomes, and that these associations will be mediated by noncompliance. Our
integration of geospatial data with administrative health and compliance data positions us to provide the first
empirical assessment of the relative importance of individual federal emergency preparedness standards and
the mechanisms by which they affect nursing home resident outcomes. The proposed research responds to
federal priorities regarding the need to improve emergency preparedness for an aging population, and will
identify modifiable factors that can be intervened upon by nursing home staff and regulators to improve
resident outcomes after exposure to severe weather events."
10975548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Craniosynostosis is a craniofacial disorder, which is characterized by the premature fusion of cranial sutures with
the loss of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs). Some craniosynostosis have neurocognitive deficits, which
are attributed to abnormally increased intracranial pression (ICP). However, the causes of ICP elevation and
brain defects in craniosynostosis are poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to establish novel
mechanisms and a therapeutic strategy by which suture MSC implantation can lead to long-term reduction of
ICP and reverse neurological deficits in craniosynostosis. The scientific premise is based on our recently
published data (Cell, 2021, PMID: 33417861; Cell Stem Cell 2023, PMID: 37863055), in which we established
the first animal model of neurological defects in craniosynostosis, identified meningeal lymphatic vessel (mLV)
defect as a pathological driving factor for cognitive defects, developed a MSC-based suture regeneration
approach, and used this approach and successfully rescued brain structure and function defects in Twist1+/-
mice. This is significant because craniosynostosis is a major congenital disorder with a prevalence of 1 in every
2500 births. Previous animal research on craniosynostosis has mainly focused on skull dysmorphology, while
brain and neurological defects have largely been neglected. Current clinical practice in treating craniosynostosis
involves highly invasive complex surgery on calvarial bones at a very young age, with significant blood loss and
often requires repeated surgeries to prevent bone re-fusion. Our MSC-based treatment provides several
advantages over these practices, which include requiring only a single surgery at a focal cranial suture site with
minimal invasiveness, as well as the ability to reverse both skull and neurological defects. To truly enable clinical
translation, it is prudent to determine why MSC implantation has such robust benefits in correcting brain defects
in craniosynostosis. Preliminary data identified two potential risk factors for ICP elevation, including meningeal
lymphatic and cerebral vein defects. These defects might not be improved by the standard surgical operation in
current clinics but can be corrected by MSC implantation, which is the focus of this proposal. Overall, building
upon our strong preliminary data, this study seeks to provide the preclinical validation of MSC implantation as a
better therapeutic strategy over the surgical approach in current clinical practice for brain deficits in
craniosynostosis."
10975608,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are the costliest diseases in
the U.S. Yet they often go undiagnosed or get diagnosed after substantial delay, leading to undertreatment,
delays in care, and underestimation of the total cost of AD/ADRD. Racial and ethnic minority individuals and
underserved rural populations are more likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.
 This project will estimate a novel probabilistic dementia classification for more than 10 million beneficiaries
aged 65 and older in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA). The classification will be
estimated using linked Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Medicare data, building on an AD/ADRD
classification model we developed in prior research that substantially improves the classification accuracy
among racial and ethnic groups. We will determine the extent to which racial and ethnic minority groups and
underserved populations are disproportionally affected by AD/ADRD diagnostic errors and delays. Then we will
estimate in large Medicare data how AD/ADRD status and diagnoses affect health care utilization and costs,
such as emergency department visits, hospitalization, long-term nursing home admissions, Medicare total cost
of care, out-of-pocket costs, and mortality.
 Medicare claims and encounter data are often used to estimate the health care costs of AD/ADRD because
the data cover almost the entire population 65 and older, have detailed records of health care utilization, and
have objective claims-based diagnostic information about AD/ADRD. However, the widely used Chronic
Conditions Warehouse algorithm assigns dementia status based on a broad range of International
Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes, many of which use cognitive limitations to stand in for dementia,
leading to misclassifications and biased cost estimates. We will use a probabilistic correction for these biases.
 The project has four aims: (1) Derive a novel probabilistic AD/ADRD classification method using HRS and
Medicare data and document the fraction of older adults who live with AD/ADRD without medical diagnoses or
receive delayed diagnoses; (2) Estimate the impact of AD/ADRD status and diagnosis on health care
utilization, costs, and mortality; (3) Examine disparities in AD/ADRD status and diagnosis and their cost
implications, focusing on differences between racial and ethnic groups and rural and urban populations; and
(4) Share knowledge and methods with the Consortium and disseminate findings to stakeholders.
 The derived measures of AD/ADRD status and diagnoses will significantly improve research on the
economic and health impacts of AD/ADRD and provide more accurate estimates for minority populations. The
findings from this work will inform AD/ADRD policymaking by showing potential gains from correcting diagnosis
errors and providing needed services to patients and caregivers."
10977365,"SUMMARY
The dysregulation of mitochondrial networks responsible for maintaining normal metabolism is an
established hallmark of cancer and an early event in tumorigenesis. The disruption of cell metabolism
leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers maladaptive signaling that
disrupts metabolic balance, which can establish a tumorigenic and/or therapy resistant phenotype.
In this regard, a subgroup of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast malignancies, which exhibit
increased ROS levels and a high risk of recurrence due to endocrine therapy, has been identified.
We recently found a novel mitochondrial signaling axis centered on manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD), which when the acetylation (Ac) status of lysine 68 (K68-Ac) is altered, disrupts
cell metabolism, leading to aberrant ROS levels (Zhu, Nature Commun., 2019). In addition, breast
cancer cells expressing a MnSOD-K68-Ac mimic mutant (MnSODK68Q) exhibited increased HIF2α
(known to promote stemness-like properties), increased SOX2 and Oct4 (two established stem cell
biomarkers), leading to oncogenicity and pan resistance phenotype (PanR) to agents commonly
used in luminal B breast malignancies-implying that disruption of cell metabolism reprograms tumors
to exhibit a lineage plasticity phenotype. Based on our new data, our recent publication (Zhu et al,
Nature Commun. 2019), and work by others, it is hypothesized that dysregulated MnSOD biology,
due to aberrant/increased MnSOD-K68-Ac levels, disrupts normal cellular and mitochondrial
metabolism. This initiates metabolic reprogramming, via increased levels of HIF2α, leading to a cell
stemness-mediated tumor-permissive and/or PanR phenotype. Thus, we seek to further explore how
MnSOD-K68-Ac disrupts cell metabolism and promotes a stemness-like phenotype, leading to
oncogenicity and/or PanR. Finally, will GC4419 exposure, a chemical SOD detoxification mimic,
reverse the oncogenic and/or PanR phenotypes?"

Sensitive Treponema pallidum genome recovery through tiling amplicon sequencing
Genomic epidemiology is now a standard part of the public health response to outbreaks
of bacterial pathogens. For most bacteria, genome recovery is performed via shotgun
sequencing of clinical isolates. Genome recovery for Treponema pallidum, the causative
agent of syphilis, is more complicated due to the lack of routine culture for the organism
in clinical labs. Expensive reagents and complicated protocols are required to perform
hybridization capture, which is not standard in clinical or public health microbiology
laboratories. Even then, the analytical sensitivity of hybridization capture does not meet
the low levels of T. pallidum DNA present in most clinical samples, leading to failure of
complete genome recovery in over half of clinical specimens that test PCR positive for T.
pallidum DNA. Here, we propose to optimize methods to recover T. pallidum genomes
from diverse specimens to allow for greater analytical sensitivity and scale. Specifically,
based on recent data from hundreds of newly sequenced T. pallidum genomes, we will
design a tiling amplicon sequencing approach for T. pallidum genome recovery, using 2-
3kb sized PCR amplicons compatible with both long-read and short-read sequencing.
We will then fully validate this tiling amplicon library generation approach using both
cultured isolates and diverse clinical T. pallidum specimens taken from across the world
to determine its analytical sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy. Finally, we will
widely share our standard operation procedures and reagents for executing this work in
research and public health laboratories across the world. The proposed work will extend
the analytical sensitivity, ease of workflow, and cost-effectiveness for T. pallidum
genome recovery, enabling genomic epidemiology to inform outbreak response and
prevention for syphilis."

ABSTRACT
Bacterial eye infections frequently arise as a complication of corrective surgery or contact lens use.
Therapeutic treatment of such infections is often complicated by intrinsic and acquired drug resistant
mechanisms, which eventually leads to irreversible eye damage and vision loss. Identification of antibacterial
compounds with a new mode of action could potentially alleviate this problem. This project seeks to evaluate
condensin inhibitors for efficacy during ocular infections. Condensins play a central role in global chromosome
organization and segregation and are required for virulence in diverse bacteria. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
condensins are integrated into the control of lifestyle and virulence and are required during eye infection. This
project will investigate how the inhibition of condensins affects the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the host
and examine the efficacy of the lead condensin inhibitor in an in vivo model of bacterial keratitis."
10977332,"More than 60% cancer patients experience chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN), a severe side effect of
chemotherapy (including platinum drugs, vinca alkaloids, taxanes and/or bortezomib). CIN may cause
treatment delays, dose reductions, or discontinuation of therapy which can affect survival rates. With
improved cancer treatments and longer survival, the late effects of CIN continue to produce a significant
burden in up to 50% of cancer survivors who are suffering from CIN 6 years after treatment, with a 1.8-fold
increased risk of falls. CIN continues to cause significant functional disability, negatively impacts quality of
life, and significantly demands high health care costs and resource use.
We propose to test auricular point acupressure (APA)—a non-invasive and nonpharmacological patient
managed strategy—as an innovative solution for CIN. APA is developed from auricular acupuncture, which
is an invasive (using needles) and passive treatment (administered by a licensed practitioner). APA is a
non-invasive and active treatment for patients with pain. It involves needleless acupuncture-like stimulation
of ear points. Small seeds are taped on specific ear points by a skilled provider and patients press on the
seeds to stimulate ear points three times daily, three minutes per time, for a total of nine minutes per day to
achieve pain relief. APA provides pain relief within 1–2 minutes after ear stimulation and sustains pain relief
for one month after a 4-week APA intervention. APA is popular in Taiwan, China, and Europe. Though its
use is sparse in the U.S., a limited number of clinical trials have supported APA in pain management.
This study will provide vital information to gain a comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanism of
APA on CIN and provide strong impetus for including APA as part of CIN management in clinical settings."
10977339,"Project Summary
Most studies investigate whole cancer cell populations and rarely address how single cells or sub-populations
cooperate to promote their survival and spread. This is especially true in the context of metabolism, where tumors
harbor distinct sub-populations of glycolytic and oxidative cells forged in part by microenvironmental pressures.
How this metabolic heterogeneity drives tumor invasion and metastasis is an unexplored area and requires
approaches that can isolate these specific cancer cell sub-populations. This multi-PI application in lung
adenocarcinoma attempts to address this by determining how metabolically heterogeneous cancer cell sub-
populations function and cooperate to drive invasion and metastasis. We build upon our published image-guided
genomics technology (SaGA) to extract living and phenotypically defined cell sub-populations within collectively
invading packs. We used SaGA to deconstruct the lung cancer collective invasion pack, which is comprised of
hierarchical groups of invasive leader and proliferative follower cells invading as a cohesive unit. Our published
and preliminary data show that follower cells consume twice as much glucose as leaders, and rely on glycolysis
and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to maintain their proliferative state. By simply disrupting
the glucose transporter, GLUT1, followers become invasive and take on a leader-like phenotype. In contrast,
leaders rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity to drive
invasion, where disrupting PDH creates a more follower-like phenotype. These data lead to our overarching
hypothesis that metabolic heterogeneity sustained by differential GLUT1 and PDH-driven metabolism facilitates
lung cancer metastasis by maintaining distinct phenotypes in the collective invasion pack. We propose that this
metabolic heterogeneity warrants a co-targeting therapeutic approach that disrupts both metabolic populations
to inhibit metastasis. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to 1) elucidate the molecular basis and mechanistic
underpinnings of how metabolic heterogeneity drives collective invasion and 2) test if co-targeting different
metabolic sub-populations limits metastasis. We propose that these studies will directly impact our understanding
of how metabolic heterogeneity sustains cooperativity to promote collective invasion/metastasis."

Somali women living in the U.S. have lower cervical cancer screening rates than the U.S. general female
population. This disparity is due to a range of factors, including limited awareness of HPV and cervical cancer,
cultural and religious beliefs, mistrust of health care providers, concerns around modesty and circumcision,
and low provider self-efficacy to perform Pap tests on circumcised women. HPV self-sampling is an emerging
cervical cancer screening modality that may address common screening barriers among Somali women,
particularly those related to modesty and circumcision. HPV self-sampling is accurate for detecting pre-
cancerous cervical lesions and effective in reaching underscreened women. In addition, our pilot work has
demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling in Somali women. While research has
focused primarily on home-based HPV self-sampling, there is an untapped opportunity to offer HPV self-
sampling in the primary care setting. Offering HPV self-sampling in primary care could effectively increase
cervical cancer screening rates in Somali women by positioning providers to address screening barriers,
enabling clinics to opportunistically fit in HPV self-sampling with other appointments, and providing an
alternative modality for circumcised women. We propose a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation design
to assess the effectiveness and implementation of a patient-centered, culturally-tailored HPV self-sampling
intervention for Somali women. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science and Social
Cognitive Theory, we will conduct focus groups with Somali patients and interviews with providers to identify
patient-, provider-, clinic-, and systems-level factors to inform refinement of intervention materials and
development of implementation strategies (Aim 1). After tailoring the intervention, we will then implement HPV
self-sampling in 2 primary care clinics, and evaluate changes in Somali women’s cervical cancer screening
rates one-year pre and one-year post implementation (Aim 2). Changes will be compared with Somali women
attending 27 control clinics followed over the same time period, using difference-in-difference methods. Finally,
using RE-AIM, we will conduct a post-implementation mixed methods analysis of the processes and strategies
needed to successfully implement HPV self-sampling in primary care for Somali patients (Aim 3), including
interviews with providers and Somali women. Our hypothesis is that implementing HPV self-sampling in
primary care will lead to increased uptake of cervical cancer screening in Somali women and that an
implementation science based analysis of the processes needed to successfully implement the intervention will
lead to sustainable, novel strategies to support the sustained integration of HPV self-sampling into primary
care."
10977350,"Summary: Our Phase I prototype, College Readiness Stories (CRS) will be based on our innovative
process that captures the knowledge and best practices from research scientists, practicing counselors,
and successful adults with the disability and encodes their experience into a human-computer interaction,
known as an Accessible Interactive Fiction (AIF) story.
We developed this process as part of two NIDILRR SBIR projects; one that enables teens with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to build workplace readiness skills, and one that enables teens with vision
impairments (VI) to build skills for the transition to independent adult living.
Our Phase I project will answer two Specific Question:
§ To what extent do college bound students with ADHD or ASD students find an AIF story
 game to be a usable and engaging system to practice College Readiness executive
 functioning skills?
§ To what extent do non-experts find the Training Guide and Skill Charts useful for helping
 college bound students with these disabilities improve these skills?
These questions will be answered through four Specific Aims (SA). In SA-1, we define the
specifications for the prototype AIF story game. In SA-2, create the prototype AIF story game.
In SA-3, create the Training Guide and Skill Charts. In SA-4, we assess the prototype’s usability
and engagement by recruiting CBASD students and their parents to use the AIF story game and
then measure the student’s rating of the story’s usability and engagement, and their parents rating
of the usefulness of the Training Guide and Skill Charts.
Progress: We have had numerous meetings between our development staff and the Expert team
(research scientists and teachers) to identify the specific executive functioning skills that will be
practiced in the AIF story, and to create the outline of the story and of each chapter in the story.
We have not encountered any administrative or technical challenges yet; our primary concern is
the commercial challenges that lay ahead. There are many several go-to-market alternatives; we
need to determine which is the most appropriate.

Luke Voelk, Chief Technical Officer, is a cofounder of our company, and was entrepreneur lead
in an NSF iCorp program for our other product, BuddyBooks. Luke will be the iCorp C-level
Corporate Officer, as he has a strong background in customer discovery and product
development.
August Voelk, Product Manager, will be our Technical Lead. August has managed five AIF
projects for students with disabilities, including the two mentioned above, from product
definition to customer pilots.
Our Industry Expert will be Mark Ventre, one of the investors in our company, and the former
COO of a Special Education company that was strategically acquired.

10975540,"Abstract
 Millions of older adults receive care in intensive care units (ICUs) annually. However, the quality and
accessibility of ICU-based palliative care is highly variable across hospitals and clinicians, due in part to
specialists’ limited workforce and geographic inconsistency. Furthermore, there are few evidence-based
interventions designed to help ICU clinicians provide primary palliative care themselves—and even fewer
interventions tested among participants who adequately reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the US.
 To address these gaps, we developed an innovative mobile app-based primary palliative care
intervention called ICUconnect. ICUconnect facilitates families’ and patients’ self-report of actual
palliative care needs across all core domains of palliative care quality, provides ICU clinicians with a
scalable digital infrastructure for coordinating consistent and personalized needs-targeted care, and
provides a variety of informational supports relevant to each user’s role. In a recent single-center cluster
RCT with 111 patient-family member dyads (U54 MD012530), 42% of whom were Black, ICUconnect
significantly improved unmet needs and goal concordance of care compared to usual care control. We
have since linguistically and culturally adapted the intervention to Latin American Spanish.
 What is now needed is a multicenter RCT to test the intervention’s efficacy in a population diverse in
race, ethnicity, and geography that reflects the real-world experience of patients and family members.
Therefore, we propose to test ICUconnect vs. usual care control among 350 patient-family member
dyads with elevated baseline levels of unmet palliative care need in a 4-site network serving a diverse
population (Duke, Medical University of South Carolina, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Columbia).
The specific aims are to: (1) Test the efficacy of ICUconnect vs. usual care control in improving palliative
care needs and other person-centered outcomes including psychological distress, (2) Determine
participant characteristics associated with a greater treatment response using a heterogeneity of
treatment effects approach, and (3) Ensure off-the-shelf intervention readiness for implementation using
a mixed-methods integration of qualitative analysis of semi-structured trial participant interviews and
quantitative RE-AIM implementation framework-informed trial data.
 This project is likely to make a strong clinical impact because it fills notable gaps in the rigor of prior
research, targets populations often omitted from past palliative care trials, and tests an innovative
intervention that could be immediately used in any healthcare setting at population scale, is easily
adaptable to any language, leverages strong preliminary data, and includes new concepts in care
delivery and outcomes measurement. The likelihood of success is high because of the team’s expertise
in clinical trials, critical care, palliative care, geriatrics, health equity, and health technology."

The overarching goal of this R21 grant proposal is to evaluate racial and ethnic disparities in patient outcomes,
racial and ethnic differences in the three key intra-arrest interventions (time to shock delivery; time to
epinephrine administration; time to termination of resuscitation), and quantify the impact of the racial and ethnic
differences in time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) on outcomes disparities among adult patients
with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) using the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines–
Resuscitation (GWTG–R), a multicenter prospective quality improvement registry of IHCA in the United States.
IHCA is a critical public health issue, affecting approximately 292,000 Americans annually. Despite various
efforts, the mortality after IHCA remains high, and only 18.8% of patients survive to hospital discharge,
highlighting its significance in the nation. Prior studies reported racial disparities in patient outcomes following
IHCA, with Black patients experiencing unfavorable outcomes than White patients. However, little is known
about outcomes among Hispanic patients compared with Black and White patients. Moreover, the underlying
mechanisms of racial disparities between Black and White patients remain unclear. Racial and ethnic
differences in intra-arrest resuscitative interventions are the potential source of the health inequity. Evaluating
racial and ethnic disparities in intra-arrest resuscitative interventions will enhance our understanding of these
potential disparities in the process of care and identify modifiable areas for improvement in IHCA care. We will
investigate three crucial intra-arrest resuscitative interventions: time to shock delivery, time to epinephrine
administration, and time to termination of resuscitation (TOR)—all are directly linked with patient outcomes.
To fill the crucial gaps in knowledge and mitigate the health inequity in IHCA, we will investigate patients’ racial
and ethnic disparities in time to ROSC, survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcome at
hospital discharge across Hispanic, Black, and White patients (Aim 1); evaluate patients’ racial and ethnic
differences in time to shock delivery (Aim 2A), epinephrine administration (Aim 2B), and TOR (Aim 2C); and
quantify the impact of racial and ethnic differences in time to ROSC on racial and ethnic disparities in survival
and favorable functional outcome after IHCA using causal mediation analyses (Aim 3).
In our project, we will employ IHCA as a representative case for emergent conditions, with the objective of
evaluating racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes and intra-arrest practices. We anticipate that our study will
identify specific areas where interventions can be implemented to mitigate the health inequity in IHCA."

Hypertension is a key risk factor for the development of cerebral small vessel disease, the foremost source of
vascular cognitive impairment which is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.
There is increasing evidence that blood brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation play a pivotal role in
the pathophysiology of hypertension and contribute to the development of vascular cognitive impairment. While
Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonists are first line therapy to treat hypertension they have recently been
demonstrated to improve neurocognitive function. Given the annual cost of dementia in the US is expected to
double by 2040, the prevalence of hypertension rises from 46% of U.S. adults aged 20-44 to >78% of U.S.
adults above the age of 65, and that hypertension incidence increases dramatically post-menopause there is a
critical public health need for a greater understanding of the mechanistic link(s) between sex, age-dependent
hypertension and vascular cognitive impairment. This application will test the global hypothesis that normal
aging evokes sex-dependent hypertension that drives central microvascular injury and neuroinflammation to
cause vascular cognitive impairment which can be ameliorated by Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor antagonism.
Our Aims will be conducted in male and female 3-, 8-, and 16-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (model of
normal aging). The following Specific Aims will test this hypothesis: Specific Aim 1: Hypothalamic PVN blood
brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation contribute to age-dependent hypertension via a reversible
sex-dependent Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor mechanism. Specific Aim 2: Age-dependent hypertension
evoked hippocampal microvascular injury and neural circuit dysfunction drives vascular cognitive impairment
via a reversible sex-dependent Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor mechanism. Our innovative approach is directly
aligned with NIA Stratetgic Goals that address Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias and is designed
to provide novel insights into the basic mechanisms contributing to sex- and age-dependent hypertension-
driven vascular cognitive impairment and fully meets the intent of PAR-19-070 and NOT-AG-20-038. Specific
Aim 1 will establish that hypothalamic PVN blood brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation contribute to
the development of age-dependent hypertension, which drives vascular cognitive impairment, via a reversible
sex-dependent Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor mechanism. Specific Aim 2 will establish that age-dependent
hypertension evoked hippocampal microvascular injury and neural circuit dysfunction drives vascular cognitive
impairment via a reversible sex-dependent Angiotensin II Type 1 receptor mechanism. Our innovative
approach will directly investigate the sex dependent mechanistic sequelae of events and underlying neural
dysfunction in both the PVN and hippocampus that is associated with, and perhaps contributing to, age-
dependent hypertension-driven vascular cognitive impairment."

 Our objective is to build a data repository focused on collecting and sharing bone phenotyping data
performed on rodent animal models. Over the last ten years, our group has been actively involved in the bone
phenotyping of over 200 mutant mouse lines. Working through the organization, storage, and viewing of
datasets generated from this project made us recognize the extreme value that a skeletal repository would
have for the entire bone community. We now propose to dramatically expand this effort and build a
computational infrastructure, global in-scale, to collect and share bone phenotyping data generated by national
and international researchers across the field.
 While significant limitations exist in the skeletal phenotyping of human patients, rodents remain the
animal model of choice to study skeletal biology and model human skeletal diseases, where extensive
phenotyping is routinely performed. Because the experimental animals are genetically homogeneous, the data
captured is quantitative and, when coupled with experimental metadata, provides valuable insight into the
mechanistic regulation of bone tissue. The magnitude of experimental questions being tested in rodent animal
models to determine a skeletal phenotype is highly relevant to human disease, making for a rich data source
that that if properly archived and shared can be exploited to understand mechanisms of skeletal regulation for
rodents and humans. Unfortunately, existing rodent databases that collect genotype-phenotype data are
extremely broad in scope and are not built to ingest bone phenotyping data. Taken together, this project
addresses an unmet need in the skeletal field and will provide a highly valued resource that investigators can
computationally mine to develop superior therapeutic approaches to treat skeletal disease.
 Here we have assembled a talented multidisciplinary team of bone biologists and computer scientists
reinforced by the resources provided by UConn’s High Performance Computing Facility and Digital Experience
Group to build a sustainable skeletal phenotyping repository. Our resource development plan has three major
goals: 1) Develop a data ingestion method rich in the acquisition of metadata along with raw experimental data.
2) Develop a database system that incorporates the use of identifiers and ontologies to maximize data access
and interoperability with outside databases. 3) Develop a web portal that maximizes FAIR (Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) principles and becomes the go-to resource for investigators to
enhance their research. A vital component of this resource plan also involves the use of scientific emissaries
based in North America, Europe, and Asia that will engage with members of the bone community and be
responsive to their needs."
10977279,"Project Summary
This revised renewal application requests funding for years 15-19 for a proposal that is devoted to
understanding the impact of genetic hypomorphs of the p53 tumor suppressor on cancer risk and therapy.
The central premise is that the analysis of cancer-associated genetic hypomorphs of the p53 tumor
suppressor can lend critical insight into the key functions of this tumor suppressor in cancer. The proposed
research focuses on the African-specific Pro47Ser p53 hypomorph (hereafter S47) that exists in over
800,000 African-descent individuals in the United States and confers increased cancer risk in these
individuals. The S47 variant of p53 is defective in the transactivation of a small subset of p53-target genes,
particularly those that confer sensitivity to ferroptosis. The overarching hypothesis of the proposed
research is that by understanding the biology of P47S and other cancer-associated hypomorphs, two
important outcomes are met: the first is the identification of key tumor suppressor functions of p53, which
are still not known. The second is that we can use mouse models in order to better understand cancer
risk, and uncover superior cancer therapies, for the individuals who possess these variants.
In Aim 1 we will investigate our finding that the tumor micro-environment in S47 mice is more immuno-
suppressive, due to increased accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs are
potent immunosuppressive cells that directly limit the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We will
test the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in WT and S47 mice, and we will test combination therapy
in which we target MDSCs. In Aim 2 we present data that P47S, like two other cancer-associated p53
hypomorphs Y107H and G334R, has impaired ability to transactivate the chromatin modifier PADI4, along
with increased propensity to misfold and adopt a mutant p53 conformation. We will investigate the
relevance of both activities to tumor suppression by p53. In Aim 3 we provide PheWAS data indicating
that the S47 allele is a highly significant risk factor for bladder cancer in African Americans (p< 6x10-6, OR
7.5). In this aim we investigate the function of S47 in mouse models of bladder cancer, with the goal of
better understanding the reasons underlying this significant association. We then follow our published
successful protocols to identity novel chemotherapeutic drugs that show improved efficacy in S47 bladder
cancer, compared to WT. The combined studies build upon a wealth of published and preliminary data,
along with novel mouse models for p53 hypomorphs and the integration of human data throughout. These
studies are paramount for our long term goal of understanding the genetic basis of minority cancer
disparities, and improving personalized medicine approaches for individuals of African descent."
10977281,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification on poly(A) RNA. Dynamic regulation of
the m6A epitranscriptome is involved in diverse cellular functions. m6A mediates these functions by affecting
mRNA translation, alternative splicing, nuclear export and degradation, and miRNA biogenesis and binding
through three groups of proteins: methyltransferases or “writers”, demethylases or “erasers”, and m6A-binding
proteins or “readers”. m6A is present in the genomes of RNA viruses and regulates the replication of these
viruses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and
primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) commonly found in AIDS patients. Understanding the mechanism regulating
KSHV latent and lytic replication can not only provide insights into the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced cancers
but also serve as the basis for developing novel therapy. In the current funding period, we have made
significant progresses toward this goal. For this renewal, we have discovered that m6A is abundant on KSHV
transcripts, and that m6A reader protein YTHDF2 acts as an antiviral factor during viral lytic replication. We
demonstrate m6A dynamics during KSHV latent and lytic replications, and in different cell types that support
distinct viral replication programs. Despite these works, the roles of m6A in KSHV infection have just started to
be revealed. The Objective of this application is to systematically map the dynamics of m6A modifications at a
single base resolution and bindings of m6A reader proteins in KSHV epitranscriptome, and determine their
functions in different phases of KSHV life cycle, and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis. The Central Hypothesis is
that KSHV m6A modifications are dynamically regulated, and these modifications mediate different phases of
KSHV life cycle, and hence KSHV-induced tumorigenesis. We will test this hypothesis by mapping m6A marks
in KSHV transcriptome at a single base resolution, and determine the roles of m6A writer and eraser proteins in
different phases of KSHV life cycle and KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (Aim 1); determining the functions of
m6A reader proteins in different phases of KSHV life cycle by gain- and loss-of-function approaches and by
examining their bindings to KSHV transcripts (Aim 2); and examining the functions of KSHV m6A marks in the
context of viral infection using Crispr-Cas9-guided m6A writer and eraser, and by site-specific mutagenesis
(Aim 3). It is our expectations that this project will provide comprehensive mapping and functional delineation
of m6A marks, and m6A writer, eraser and reader proteins in different phases of KSHV life cycle, and KSHV-
induced tumorigenesis. This work is highly significant as it will, for the first time, systematically reveal the
functions of these RNA modifications in KSHV infection, thus providing insights into the mechanism regulating
KSHV life cycle and KSHV-induced pathogenesis. This study will also identify potential prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets. The proposed work is highly innovative as it will use new technologies to map m6A marks
and bindings of m6A reader proteins, as well as directly manipulate m6A marks on key viral transcripts by
Crispr-Cas9-guided m6A writer and eraser, KSHV reverse genetics, and innovative tumor models.
Furthermore, the generated datasets, information and reagents will be valuable to the scientific community."
10977284,"Tubulin microtentacles in detached mammary epithelial cells.
 Breast tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through non-adherent microenvironments, such as the
bloodstream or lymphatics. However, very little is known about the dynamic behavior and drug responses of
non-adherent tumor cells, due to the challenges of imaging non-adherent cells without blurring from cell drift.
 The PI’s lab discovered unique microtentacles (McTNs) on the surface of non-adherent tumor cells that
promote the aggregation and retention of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the lung capillaries of living mice.
 This project will test the hypothesis that actin cortical contraction regulates molecular mechanisms underlying
McTNs and can be targeted through independent pathways to reduce the clustering and reattachment of CTCs
during metastasis. Predictions of this hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1: Inhibit kinases regulating actin cortical contraction to impact McTNs.
A) Define impact of pathway inhibitors on microtentacles and supporting molecular mechanisms.
B) Analyze inhibitor impacts on tumor cell mechanical properties (Brillouin microscopy, AFM).
C) Test prioritized drugs in zebrafish (CTC reattachment), mice (orthotopic, PDX) and live patient tumor cells.
Specific Aim 2: Test role of X-ROS mechanotransduction on McTN mechanisms and function.
A) Chemically inhibit TRPM8 and calcium signaling to influence McTN mechanisms.
B) Gauge effects of pathway inhibitors on MCAM and genetically regulating MCAM or TRPM8 (CRISPR).
C) Test prioritized mechanotransduction genes and drugs in zebrafish, mice and patient tumor cells.
Specific Aim 3: Target mechanisms of McTN-mediated tumor clustering.
A) Define McTN mechanisms that inhibit homotypic/heterotypic clustering with Digitoxin or Ouabain.
B) Downregulate desmosomal protein DSG3 to reduce McTN-mediated tumor cell clustering.
C) Test prioritized anti-clustering mechanisms in zebrafish, mice and live patient tumor cells.
This project will use innovative bioengineering techniques (TetherChip, Brillouin microscopy) and examine
highly-conserved mechanotransduction principles (X-ROS), recently identified by the PI’s lab in epithelial tumor
cells. Inclusion of FDA-approved therapies and drugs in current clinical trials will increase the potential to rapidly
translate the outcomes of this project to impact the clinical treatment of metastatic breast cancer."

In August 2023, the unprecedented Maui wildfires, Hawaii's worst natural disaster, aggravated existing
socioeconomic and health disparities among Maui's diverse population, including Native Hawaiians, Filipino
Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos. This catastrophe amplified chronic disease risk factors and conditions already
prevalent among these groups. Moreover, environmental hazards post-wildfires expose residents to health-
compromising contaminants, underscoring an urgent need to understand the disaster's multifaceted impact. We
aim to (1) Initiate a comprehensive cohort study examining wildfire exposure's socioeconomic and health impacts
on 1,000 residents, integrating survey tools with biospecimen analyses to measure stress and toxicant exposure.
(2) Conduct longitudinal analysis by revisiting the cohort annually for five years, tracking health and
socioeconomic changes during recovery, and comparing findings to unexposed cohorts. (3) Craft a
comprehensive dissemination strategy and deploy a data-driven toolkit supporting recovery efforts, guiding
policy-making, and enhancing disaster preparedness strategies. Our pioneering research will address the
uncharted intersection of social and biological consequences from Maui wildfires, aspiring to guide informed
disaster recovery and resilience planning locally and nationwide."
10975838,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The broad goal of our research is to understand the biological functions of type IV collagens in the extracellular
matrix and determine the mechanisms by which they cause genetic and acquired diseases. Type IV collagen
alpha 3 (COL4A3), COL4A4, and COL4A5 form a heterotrimer that is critical to the function of the glomerular
basement membrane. It has been known for decades that COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mutations cause
inherited nephropathies, however, collagens are stable, insoluble proteins that are difficult to isolate which has
been a significant barrier to their study. The purpose of this proposal is to validate a novel and powerful tool that
enables unveiling of spatiotemporal changes in collagen deposition and degradation and enhance the ability to
isolate collagens for biochemical characterization in physiological and pathological contexts.
The inability to distinguish cell type specific or temporal changes to the extracellular matrix constitutes a
significant obstacle for understanding a fundamental aspect of tissue biology. To address this barrier, we will
develop two mouse lines in which type IV collagens are fused with switchable fluorescent proteins for isoform-
specific visualization and biochemical tags for differential affinity purification. These simple but powerful tools will
enable unprecedented characterization of spatial, temporal, biochemical and biophysical parameters of ECM
that are currently impossible to achieve. If the detailed validations outlined in this proposal are successful, we
will have developed a transformative tool that will provide significant insight into a fundamental aspect of tissue
biology and that can be applied to every organ of the body in normal development or in pathological settings."
10977275,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with a median
survival of up to 20 months. Males have a 1.6-fold higher incidence of GBM compared to females and worse
disease outcome. Standard-of-care treatment and immunotherapies, which are currently in clinical trials, have
had limited success improving patient outcome. An immunosuppressive microenvironment facilitating tumor
progression and restricting anti-tumor immune response likely underlies therapeutic resistance. Although
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs) accumulate in patients with malignancies and play a critical role in the
establishment of this immunosuppressive milieu, the mechanisms by which individual MDSC subsets promote
tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. In pre-clinical models, I demonstrated that monocytic MDSCs (mMDSCs)
infiltrated tumor at higher rates in males, while granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs) were more abundant in the
peripheral circulation of females. Furthermore, there were more immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumors
of male patients and gMDSC gene signature associated with poor prognosis of female patients. MDSC subset
variation also determined sex-specific therapeutic response in preclinical models, including to fludarabine and
anti-IL-1β. I also established that complement component 1q (C1q) is highly expressed by gMDSCs and elevated
in females. Based on these observations, I hypothesize that MDSC subsets promote GBM progression via
distinct mechanisms in a sex-specific manner and that their targeting will improve the efficacy of T cell-activating
strategies. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mMDSCs and gMDSCs have distinct roles in local and
systemic immunosuppression in a sex-specific manner. This aim will investigate the changes in tumor growth,
vascular density and immune activation status by adoptively transferring MDSC subsets and selectively depleting
MDSCs in bone marrow chimeras. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the unique gene expression
signatures of MDSC subsets makes them susceptible to distinct drugs that can be combined with checkpoint
modulators. Sub-Aim 2A will examine the efficacy of drug candidates on MDSC activity in vitro and in vivo, while
Sub-Aim 2B will attempt to achieve durable anti-tumor immune response by combining MDSC targeting
strategies with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-OX40. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that gMDSC-
derived C1q promotes MDSC lineage commitment and systemic immunosuppression by evaluating tumor
progression and checkpoint response in the absence of C1q. Sub-Aim 3A will use C1qa knockout bone marrow
and C1q receptor inhibitors to determine MDSC fate. Sub Aim 3B will use pharmacological inhibitors combined
with checkpoint modulators. These studies lay the foundation for my future research program and the
development of novel immunotherapies for GBM by addressing variations in anti-tumor immunity, repurposing
drugs and defining targetable pathways. These results are broadly applicable to other cancers and can lead to
advanced treatment opportunities and improved patient outcome."

Children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (CDHH) developing spoken language are at risk of language delays.
Language difficulties in CDHH are partially explained by hearing status factors (i.e., age of amplification) as well
as reduced exposure to caregiver language input. Recent models of language acquisition emphasize that noise
in the environment can further limit access to caregiver input. Thus, the premise of this work is that CDHH
exposed to both limited caregiver input and reduced access to language, face the highest risk of language delays.
Our long-term goal is to study longitudinally effects of overall language experiences on CDHH's behavioral and
neural language development. In this proposal, we recruit a heterogenous group of 40 preschool CDHH and
an age-matched control group of children with typical hearing (CTH). We aim to develop and assess the
effectiveness of a novel Speech Accessibility Index (SAI). The SAI is designed to quantitatively evaluate
children's access to language in real-world environments (Aim 1). In addition, we aim to assess the feasibility of
evaluating preschooler's neurophysiological correlates of language processing in noise using alpha power (Aim
2). We hypothesize that the SAI will be effective explaining variability in language skills in both groups, and that
children will engage cognitive and language areas of the brain (reflected in alpha power modulations) to
effectively listen to sentences in noise. This research uses novel ecologically valid measures of children's
auditory environments as well as cutting-edge electroencephalography analyses. Thus, we provide an innovative
methodology that holistically examines early language experiences, neural mechanisms involved in language
processing in real-world environments, and associations of these factors with preschooler's behavioral
outcomes. Thus, we will enhance our comprehension of factors affecting language acquisition in CDHH and
CTH. Moreover, the study will trigger the development of auditory-based intervention strategies aiming to
facilitate access to language in the real-world for CDHH. Therefore, this research has the potential to improve
long-term lifelong outcomes of CDHH."
10974190,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hematophagous arthropods transmit numerous viruses, many of which are serious human pathogens. To combat
the growing public health impact of arthropod-transmitted viruses, many metagenomics studies have been
performed to characterize the arthropod virome. The importance of proactive virus discovery cannot be
understated because it allows risk assessments to be performed and viral diagnostic assays and control strategies
to be developed before virus spillover occurs. Most metagenomics studies designed to identify novel arthropod-
associated viruses have focused on mosquitoes, with other hematophagous arthropods being largely neglected.
Another limitation of many previous studies is that virus isolation was not attempted, with newly discovered
viruses known only from sequence data, which has impeded their phenotypic and serological characterization. The
overall goal of this grant application is to define the virosphere of understudied hematophagous arthropods and to
identify and characterize novel viruses capable of vertebrate cell replication. Two specific aims have been designed
to achieve this goal. In specific aim 1, a diverse range blood-feeding arthropods (ticks, midges, sandflies, blackflies,
and fleas) will be assayed for novel and previously recognized viruses by unbiased high-throughput sequencing
(UHTS). These experiments will be performed using homogenates already in our possession and prepared from
>37,000 arthropods from North America. Total RNA will be directly extracted from every homogenate and viral
sequences will be identified using UHTS and an established bioinformatics pipeline, allowing the virosphere of the
arthropods to be defined. Additionally, the codon and dinucleotide frequencies of every novel virus will be
determined to provide insight into their host ranges and to identify those most likely to replicate in vertebrate
cells. In this regard, vertebrates and invertebrates preferentially have certain codon and dinucleotide usage biases
and the preferences of RNA viruses often mimic those of their hosts. In specific aim 2, an aliquot of each
homogenate will be inoculated onto human and nonhuman primate cells then two blind passages will be
performed. Total RNA will be extracted from all final culture passages and analyzed by UHTS and bioinformatics in
order to specifically identify vertebrate-infecting viruses. If an isolate is not recovered but the homogenate is
predicted to contain a vertebrate-infecting virus, as determined in the codon and dinucleotide frequency analysis,
virus isolation will be attempted using additional vertebrate cell lines. The in vitro replication kinetics and yields of
every novel virus capable of vertebrate cell replication will be determined. The studies proposed in this grant
application provide the groundwork for future in vivo experiments, where viruses capable of vertebrate cell
replication will be further characterized. Experimental infections will be performed with vertebrate animals and
arthropods to assess viral virulence and to identify competent vector species, respectively. Future experiments will
also be performed to determine the incidence and seroprevalence of select viruses in human and vertebrate animal
populations."
10975337,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects >20 million people globally, causing life-long dependency on exogenous insulin
and reduced life expectancy. Although the disease has a strong genetic basis, a substantial fraction of risk is not
explained by genetic factors alone, and neither is the marked increase in T1D incidence over recent decades.
The identification of environmental determinants of T1D is important because it can reveal underlying
mechanisms of pathogenesis and highlight intervention strategies that may be developed and/or deployed for
high-risk subjects. While infection by particular viruses has long been postulated as a risk factor for T1D, prior
studies in this area have been limited in their power and/or breadth, with many investigating relatively small
cross-sectional cohorts. Large, prospective, longitudinal studies – including TEDDY (in the US / Europe) and
ENDIA (in Australia) – offer opportunities to overcome these limitations, however existing viral analyses of these
cohorts have so far been limited in their resolution (focused on infections defined symptomatically) and/or
sensitivity (relying on the direct detection of viruses at the time/site of infection). In this project, we will overcome
these limitations by using an innovative technology (“PepSeq”) to perform a first-in-class, longitudinal, virome-
wide serology-based analysis of the TEDDY and ENDIA cohorts. PepSeq uses programmable, highly-
multiplexed libraries of DNA-barcoded peptides to enable virome-wide serology at epitope-level resolution. We
recently showed that PepSeq can be combined with longitudinal sampling and an innovative analysis algorithm
(PSEA) to enable the detection of temporally-resolved, virome-wide infection events at subspecies resolution.
Building directly on this work, we will use PepSeq+PSEA to study ~14,000 longitudinal plasma samples from
TEDDY+ENDIA case/control subjects and comprehensively catalog the timing and identity of viral infection
events. We will begin by extending our existing PepSeq human virome library (which is already capable of
subspecies resolution) to enable highly-controlled comparisons across ~600-700 virus subtypes (Aim 1). Next,
we will test whether and when these viruses are associated with autoimmunity in cases vs. matched controls,
using selected longitudinal samples from (i) the first year of life, (ii) the year preceding the onset of T1D/IA, and
(iii) mothers during pregnancy. Overall, our approach combines the power of longitudinal sampling (to
establish a temporal link with autoimmunity), the sensitivity of serology (to detect infections across all body
sites) and the breadth and resolution of PepSeq (using 10,000s of peptides to address the virome
comprehensively and at subspecies resolution). Together, these innovations have the potential to reveal viral
associations with autoimmunity that could not have been detected with previous, less powered approaches.
Moreover, by generating the largest known longitudinal dataset of virome-wide, subtype-resolved infection
events in two highly-characterized birth cohorts, this project will enable future studies focused on the natural
history and consequences of viral infections during ontogeny."
10976836,"Project Summary The bulk of increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor in glaucoma occurs at
the vicinity of the inner wall endothelium of the Schlemm’s Canal (SC). The giant vacuoles (GVs) and pores
associated with the SC endothelial cells are the only open spaces for the aqueous humor to enter the canal.
Thus, they are thought to play an important role in regulating outflow resistance. GVs form in response to a basal
to apical pressure gradient that subjects SC cells to substantial deformation. The extent of this deformation is
mediated by SC cell mechanics. We recently discovered that the elevated outflow resistance in glaucomatous
human eyes is associated with the increased stiffness of their SC cells in situ. These observations render SC
cell stiffness a key factor in GV formation and outflow homeostasis. Yet, little is known about the mechanism(s)
that regulate the biomechanical properties of SC cells and GVs. We previously showed that SC cells become
stiffer when cultured on stiffer substrates in vitro. We also recently showed that glaucomatous SC cells and their
underlying extracellular matrix are stiffer than their healthy counterparts in situ. These findings suggest that the
mechanical properties of SC cells are substrate dependent. In this project, I aim to examine the role of the
vimentin intermediate filament (VIF) cytoskeleton in regulating the biomechanical properties of SC cells and their
associated GVs. The reasons for my interest in VIFs are twofold: first, they are shown to be major contributors
to cell mechanics in general, they are the dominant determinant of cell mechanics at large deformations, and
they have a substrate stiffness dependent assembly state; secondly, VIFs are highly expressed in SC cells, and
it has been shown that they associate with GVs in situ and also impact their life cycle in vitro. To examine this
role, I will first knockdown vimentin in cultured human SC cells and use atomic force microscopy and traction
force microscopy to establish the role of VIFs in SC cell stiffness and contractility. The findings from these studies
will be used as a basis for additional studies employing super-resolution imaging, biochemistry, and
microfabrication to determine how substrate dependent expression and assembly states of VIFs in SC cells
affects their stiffness and contractility. I will next investigate the role of VIFs in GV formation through ex vivo
perfusion of eyes from wildtype and vimentin knockout mice followed by characterizing and comparing the GV
size and density along their SC. I will also determine the impact of the presence or absence of VIFs on the
generation of outflow resistance by measuring the outflow facility in these eyes. Finally, I will knockdown vimentin
in normotensive mouse inner wall to determine the feasibility of targeting VIFs for modulating outflow facility. I
will then extend this method to ocular hypertensive mice to gauge the effectiveness of this approach as a novel
treatment for glaucoma. Through examining the contribution of VIFs to the biomechanics of SC inner wall, I seek
to transition into an independent career in order to investigate the mechanical basis of increased outflow
resistance in glaucoma and to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the disease."

Indigenous peoples in the United States and worldwide face the starkest inequities in premature mortality of any
racial and ethnic group. In the United States, American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) Peoples have 2X higher
rates of suicide, 4X higher rates of alcohol induced deaths, and 1.6X higher drug overdose deaths compared to
the US general population. To effectively drive change in the staggering inequities, we need a scientific workforce
that better represents Indigenous peoples. To date, Indigenous and other diverse scholars are vastly
underrepresented in NIH funding, including fellowship and training grants. The parallel inequities in public health
education, training, and preventable cause mortality stem from historical and contemporary social and structural
determinants. The goal of the Elevating Indigenous Wellbeing through Assets-Based Prevention Science
(ELEVATE) Training Program is to train Indigenous and other diverse predoctoral scholars to become
leaders in health equity research and strengths-based multi-level prevention science, addressing
worsening inequities in mental- and behavioral-health-related premature mortality among Indigenous
Peoples. To accomplish this goal, we will provide rigorous training and high-quality mentorship in (1) Health
disparities/health equity research, (2) Developing and implementing multi-level prevention interventions, and (3)
Methods to design and analyze studies that evaluate multi-level prevention interventions. We will also provide
cross-cutting training in (4) Indigenous methodologies as a way to root this training and decolonizing approaches.
Trainees well benefit from the program’s interdisciplinary and team-based mentorship and training approach.
The ELEVATE program will he led by a team of Indigenous and allied leaders and leverage the vast resources
of the Johns Hopkins Blumberg School of Public Health, including the Center for Indigenous Health’s (CIH) 40+
year trust-relationships with Tribal Nations and growing number of Indigenous and allied faculty. Specifically, the
ELEVATE program will be housed in the Social and Behavioral Interventions program, but the 3 trainees per
year may also come from the Department of Mental Health or full-time students from the school wide Doctorate
of Public Health Program. Trainees well undertake a rigorous program of coursework in health equity, multilevel
prevention, and associated and Indigenous methodologies. A year-long seminar to discuss research in progress,
ongoing mentored research projects, and integrative activities will complement coursework. ELEVATE will
synergize with CIH’s NIDA-funded P50 National Center for Excellence, Community-Driven Indigenous Research,
Cultural Strengths & Leadership to Advance Equity in Drug Use Outcomes (CIRCLE). This proposed program
aligns directly with the goal of the ADVANCE Predoctoral T32, the cross-cutting themes for the Office of Disease
Prevention’s strategic plan, and would address key cross-cutting strategic priorities for NIDA, NIMH, and NIAAA.
There are currently no predoctoral training programs for Indigenous health. The ELEVATE program fills this gap
and will help build the next generation of Indigenous and other diverse prevention scientists."
10977476,"Men of African ancestry (AA) have a higher incidence and mortality from prostate cancer (PCa) than men of
European ancestry (EA). These disparities are driven by the interplay between socioeconomic, lifestyle,
environmental, and biological/genetic factors. Growing evidence indicates that AA and EA men have differences
in their PCa immunobiology resulting in the differential expression of inflammatory gene pathways. These
differences may impact the anti-tumor immune response including the immune targeting of cell surface tumor
associated antigens (TAAs). There is an urgency to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these
race-related differences and to harness them for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In this multi-PI exploratory
application, we propose to investigate differences in anti-tumor autoantibody responses to the glycolytic enzyme
enolase (ENO) in AA and EA men with PCa and exploit these differences for guiding the development of small
molecules targeting this protein as novel theranostics agents for advanced PCa. The rationale for the proposed
studies is supported by several key observations: 1) ENO, particularly the ENO1 isoform, is emerging as a cell
surface TAA with characteristics of an ideal theranostics target, whereas the ENO2 isoform could be a
theranostic biomarker for NEPC tumors; 2) AA and EA men with PCa produce a differential autoantibody
response to ENO; 3) this response has a distinctive impact on the migration of chemoresistant PCa cells; 4) the
expression of ENO2, a cell surface NEPC marker, but not that of ENO1, is lost in PCa cells with NEPC markers
as they transition to taxane resistance; and 5) we have initiated the design and characterization of novel boron-
based ENO1-targeting small molecules that will be evaluated for their antitumor activity and theranostics
potential in pre-clinical models of chemoresistant AA and EA PCa. These observations support the hypothesis
that EA and AA patients with PCa have distinctive immune responses to ENO that differentially affect tumor cell
properties, and that these responses may reveal tumor vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the development
of novel PCa theranostics agents. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms underlying the differential reactivity and
antitumor effects of anti-ENO autoantibodies in AA and EA men with PCa. Aim 2 will synthesize and functionally
characterize novel boron-based small molecule ENO1 compounds as potential therapeutics for PCa. The
proposed study has high relevance as it will uncover the biological basis for the race-related differential anti-
ENO immunoreactivity. This will provide key insights into immune determinants contributing to PCa mortality
disparities. The study will also establish ENO as a potential theranostic target for advanced PCa, which could
lead to innovative clinical strategies to reduce overall PCa mortality and its racial disparities."
10977480,"Abstract:
The overarching objective of the proposed studies is to identify and characterize early premalignant changes in
breast tissues from women that carry genetic alterations associated with a high risk of breast cancer to ultimately
develop strategies to detect and prevent the development of breast cancer. To accomplish this goal, we have
optimized three technologies to profile single breast mammary cells (MECs): (1) CyTOF mass cytometry to allow
tracking in parallel of >30 cell lineage and proliferation markers, (2) single cell RNA sequencing to identify
expression programs of cell populations enriched in mutation-carriers, and (3) multi-plex cyclic immunofluorescence
imaging (CyCIF) to simultaneous image >50 markers in situ. These technologies make it possible to detect
differences in small populations of cells that would be masked by bulk population analyses. To date, we have
profiled breast tissues from over 30 women with wild-type or mutant BRCA1 or BRCA2 by CyTOF and have
identified distinct, previously unrecognized subpopulations of cells that are enriched in breast tissues from BRCA1
and/or BRCA2 carriers. These enriched subpopulations may represent cells that are either directly on the path to
malignancy or indirectly contribute to the development of cancer in these high-risk women. We have identified RNA
signatures associated with these enriched subpopulations, which include surface markers to isolate them from
breast tissue to investigate both these possibilities and to track them within breast tumors. The signatures
associated with one of the enriched populations have provided clues as to the basis for their accumulation, as well
as potential strategies to prevent their accumulation. Using CyCIF, we have been able to identify enriched
subpopulations of cells in situ within breast tissues and track their association with aberrant histologies. We have
also developed organoid cultures that maintain all of the major MEC lineages as well as the BRCA1/2-enriched
populations, and that are able to reconstitute glandular structures in immunocompromised mice. We believe that
these tools provide an unprecedented opportunity to track the development of human cancer. In the proposed
studies, we will investigate whether and how the BRCA1/2+/mut-enriched subpopulations contribute to
tumorigenesis in mutation carriers. We will also investigate the basis for the enrichment of these populations and
the contribution of DNA damage to their enrichment. Later stage studies will focus on the development of strategies
to interfere with tumor progression, and importantly to develop novel diagnostic strategies to inform on the timing of
prophylactic interventions. In addition, we will examine tissues from women who carry mutations in other breast
cancer predisposition genes to establish whether similar subpopulations are detected in other high-risk individuals.
And lastly, we will examine the possibility that these cells represent cells-of-origin of sporadic breast tumors that
arise more broadly in the population."
10977481,"Abstract
Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart
disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in
saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While
socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare
healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context.
Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to
have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may
not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM)
have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities.
However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on
diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called
the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North
Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with
significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small
cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with
intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention
participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed
many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to
test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple
communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be
disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals
process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model.
Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an
implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding,
partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use
a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and
implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will
also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed
to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination."
10977484,"We propose to develop rectal cancer organoids (tumoroids) as
individualized models and to build a large rectal cancer tumoroid repository. Research on rectal cancers is
hampered by the paucity of models. Of the few existing in vivo models of rectal cancer, none place the tumors
in the rectal lumen, so the models fail to mimic the correct anatomic environment and local invasion. The
existing models also have not been observed to metastasize. Another problem is that we lack accurate means
to predict whether individual rectal cancer patients will respond to chemotherapy or radiation, both of which are
part of the current standard of care. We believe that both the paucity of models and the lack of predictive tools
can be addressed by patient-derived tumoroids. Tumoroids can be grown in 3-dimensional culture ex vivo or
implanted into mice, so they offer a flexible research platform. In preliminary results, we have derived tumoroid
lines from multiple patients' rectal cancers and found them to resemble the corresponding patient tumors. The
tumoroids, when implanted in mice endoluminally (i.e. in the rectum), formed locally invasive tumors capable of
metastasis. Moreover, we found tumoroids to have clinically relevant responses to chemotherapy and
radiation. Thus, drawing from these preliminary data, we hypothesize that rectal cancer tumoroids mirror the
traits of their original tumors, can be used to predict patients' response to therapy, and, when implanted
endoluminally into mice, can serve as an optimal model of rectal cancer.
We plan to develop 100 new tumoroids, which we expect to encompass much of the diversity of human rectal
adenocarcinoma. The tumoroids will be analyzed in ex vivo culture and in two mouse models: the endoluminal
implantation model and a conventional flank injection model. In these settings, we will test whether the
tumoroid accurately reflects its tumor of origin in terms of mutations, histology, and gene expression. We will
determine whether response of the tumoroids to patient-specific chemotherapy and radiation can predict the
corresponding patient's response. Of particular interest is whether individual human rectal cancers are more
accurately modeled by endoluminal implantation than by flank injection. Finally, to integrate our findings into a
comprehensive platform for broad use, we will develop a rectal cancer tumoroid biorepository seamlessly
integrated with online pathologic, genomic, and model-specific information. The online platform will be built
within our institution's cancer genomics portal, then integrated into the NCIP Hub. We have assembled a
collaborative team with expertise in colorectal surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology; organoids;
mouse models; biostatistics; and bioinformatics. We anticipate that the proposed research will credential
tumoroids as accurate models for rectal cancer research and for predicting patient responses to therapy. The
large tumoroid biorepository is likely to stimulate research on new treatments for rectal cancer. The ultimate
result will be new treatment options and better treatment selection for patients affected by this deadly disease."
10977942,"ABSTRACT
 American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities have been disproportionately negatively
impacted by opioid and stimulant drugs, health conditions that cause chronic pain, and related problems such
as trauma, suicide, and alcohol use. These problems are caused by settler colonialism. Therefore, AI/AN
communities are best positioned to understand and overcome these challenges using cultural strengths and
protective factors. Too often research is driven by funder priorities and led by non-community researchers rather
than centered on community objectives and led by local research teams. Thus, AI/AN people may not experience
sustained health benefits or have the opportunity to develop and strengthen their own research expertise and
infrastructure. In response to the opioid epidemic that is disproportionately harming Native people and calls by
AI/AN leaders to support communities in implementing their own solutions, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
invites Tribes and Native American Serving Organizations (T/NASOs) and alley organizations to form The Native
Collective Research Effort to Enhance Wellness (N CREW). The objectives of N CREW are to support T/NASOs
to conduct community prioritized research, grow their infrastructure, and improve the quality of relevant data for
local decision-making. With the support of N CREW, T/NASOs will conduct research and data improvement
projects to promote wellbeing and healing from the effects of opioid and stimulant drugs, pain, and related
problems, such as suicide, alcohol use, and historical trauma.
 We will form a key component of the N CREW Native Research Resource Network (NRRN) entitled,
“Promoting Community Wellbeing Through Indigenous Science and Healing (PC-WISH).” PC-WISH will partner
with other NRRN members to support T/NASOs as they develop and pilot research and data improvement
projects. PC-WISH is led by a Multiple Principal Investigator team of three Native Investigators (Abigail Echo-
Hawk, Kamilla Venner, Stacy Rasmus), and a non-Native researcher (Michael McDonell), who together have
over 50 years of experience leading or partnering with T/NASOs, and a productive history of collaboration with
one another. Our team has expertise in research on culturally grounded and adapted prevention, harm reduction,
treatment, and recovery interventions for opioids, stimulants, pain, and other problems, as well as leaders in
Indigenous data improvement frameworks and research with Urban Indian people.
 PC-WISH is rooted in the understanding that Indigenous Knowledge is the basis for healing in AI/AN
communities. We propose an Indigenous Research and Evaluation Partnership Model based on the metaphor
of the seasons of the harvest. Using this model and guided by the principles of Tribal and Community Based
Participatory Research, we propose the following aims. We will listen and learn from communities to understand
their research and data improvement strengths and resource needs. We will host InterTribal Cafés in the first
two quarters of the project to learn and document research readiness. We will use this information to create
Partnership Plans that will guide our supports and develop blueprints in collaboration with T/NASOs to guide
their formative work. We will develop, implement, and refine research trainings, tools, and knowledge exchange
opportunities (e.g., workgroups, ongoing consultation) to support the growth of T/NASO research capacity. We
will lead and engage in activities that establish, strengthen, and maintain partnerships, as reciprocal
communication is the foundation of effective collaboration. We will evaluate our activities by using the Indigenous
Evaluation Framework and host InterTribal Cafés at the end of Phase 1. We will use this feedback to reflect on
lessons learned in preparation for Phase 2 of N CREW. We will create a dissemination and resource website to
share lessons learned and serve as a resource to T/NASOs in the second phase of this important project. We
will partner with T/NASOs to disseminate relevant information to their communities and the field. We will also co-
lead cross-N CREW activities in collaboration with other NRRN members.
 Our work will be impactful because we have a track record of long-term sustained partnerships with Rural
and Urban T/NASOs to design, implement, and disseminate intervention research and data improvement
projects. We will use culturally grounded or adapted approaches to develop, implement, evaluate, and
disseminate our work. Our application is innovative because we have expertise that spans the prevention, harm
reduction, treatment, and recovery spectrum. We also have extensive research partnership experience in co-
developing interventions grounded in local Indigenous Knowledge and culturally adapting evidence based
approaches. Further, we can support T/NASOs who may want to develop and pilot multilevel strengths based
interventions (individual, family, community), or interventions across the lifespan. PC-WISH has strong AI/AN
leadership and representation and includes the only National Tribal Epidemiology Center that is focused on
supporting Urban Indian communities. We will utilize innovative, culturally responsive methods to support
T/NASOs in reaching their milestones, coordinate with NRRN partners, and refine our efforts so we are prepared
to support the expansion of N CREW research in Phase 2 and beyond."
10977485,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The American Cancer
Society (ACS) recommends normal body mass index (BMI), regular physical activity, and a healthy diet for
cancer survivors. In 2018, we estimated that 38% of deaths within 5 years of diagnosis could be prevented in
stage III colon cancer if all patients followed the ACS guidelines. Yet, <10% of CRC patients closely follow
these lifestyle guidelines. Investigators have yet to optimize a lifestyle intervention, capitalizing on effective
scalable components, to improve lifestyle behaviors in CRC survivors. Critical research gaps include: 1)
whether specific intervention components (e.g., text messaging, etc.) are effective, overall or in sub-groups
(men vs. women, etc.); 2) insufficient focus on improving diet; and 3) few studies with remote interventions
have measured biological outcomes. To address these gaps, we propose to use the multiphase optimization
strategy (MOST) framework to identify effective intervention components to increase the ACS guideline score
(a standardized measure of physical activity, diet, and body size) among CRC survivors. The MOST framework
is an engineering-based approach to efficiently optimize behavioral interventions while managing limited
resources. Our team at the University of California, San Francisco; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; and
Northwestern University have strong expertise conducting lifestyle interventions in cancer survivors, including
using MOST. Building on this experience, we propose a 12-month (mo.) randomized factorial experiment
among 400 CRC survivors to determine the effect of 4 candidate intervention components [text messaging,
digital health tool kit (physical activity tracker, apps), health coaching, buddy training (e.g., friend, family)] on
change in the ACS guideline score from 0 to 12 mo. Changes in the ACS score (our primary outcome) have
high potential to impact CRC survival, and it is modifiable and measurable remotely. Our Specific Aims are to:
Aim 1) Identify which of 4 candidate intervention components increase the ACS guideline score at 12 mo.
among CRC survivors. We will determine the individual and interaction effects of each component.
Secondarily, we aim to: Aim 2) Examine mediators and moderators of the intervention components’ effects on
change in the ACS guideline score from 0 to 12 mo. We will examine social cognitive theory constructs as
primary target mediators and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological/behavioral factors as potential
moderators. This aim will help us understand how and for whom the intervention components affect lifestyle
behaviors. Aim 3) Examine the ACS guideline score in relation to levels of fasting insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR
and inflammatory markers at enrollment and 12 mo. The data from all three aims of this proposal will guide our
next step to conduct a definitive randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the optimized intervention
versus standard care on risk of CRC recurrence. Overall, this proposal is a critical step toward developing an
effective and scalable lifestyle intervention to reduce CRC mortality with potential for high public health impact."
10977486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent advances in targeted therapies have revolutionized lung cancer clinical practice. Lung adenocarcinomas
harbor frequent mutations/amplifications/fusions in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS pathway
oncogenes, many of which can be targeted by FDA-approved therapies. However, the majority of patients do
not have targeted treatment options. Our previous work identified somatic RIT1 mutations in lung
adenocarcinomas and discovered that RIT1 variants act as gain-of-function mutations to promote cellular
transformation and drug resistance. RIT1 amplification and overexpression may play a similar pathogenic role.
RIT1 mutations also are found in myeloid leukemias and in the germline of individuals with Noonan Syndrome.
In all diseases, mutations in RIT1 are mutually exclusive with other RAS-pathway mutations, implicating RIT1 as
a RAS-pathway driver gene. However, our recent preliminary data show that RIT1 and KRAS substantially differ
in the downstream effectors needed to promote tumorigenesis. Further understanding the cellular consequences
of RIT1 mutations will open up new strategies for treatment of RIT1-mutant cancers.
In this proposal, we define the mechanism of action of RIT1 mutations in lung cancer and test the efficacy of two
new treatment strategies. Building on our preliminary studies that constitute the first global profiling of RIT1
function, we now will: (1) Identify the mechanism of RIT1-YAP1 synergy in lung cancer, (2) Determine how a
USP9X-RIT1 axis regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint and sensitivity to anti-mitotic therapies, and (3)
Define the therapeutic potential of anti-YAP1/TEAD and anti-mitotic therapies in RIT1-mutant lung cancer.
Ultimately, this work will advance our understanding of the role and mechanism of RIT1 mutations in cancer and
contribute the rationale and pre-clinical data needed to translate these findings into new clinical trials. Our access
to novel patient-derived and genetically-engineered mouse models, coupled with our expertise in both functional
genomics and pre-clinical studies, make our laboratory uniquely well-suited to discover new therapeutic options
and improve outcomes for patients with RIT1-mutant cancers."

10975719,"Project Summary
The long-term care industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy1, while also creating some of
the lowest-paid and lowest-quality jobs. These precarious working conditions are costly for workers – who are
disproportionately women and women of color2,3 – and the patients they care for. On the worker side, the
conditions of long-term care jobs keep families in poverty and contribute to gender and racial economic
disparities in the workforce.2,3 Worker turnover is high, and worker shortages are pervasive.4-6 These
precarious working conditions may deteriorate the quality of care workers can provide and have a detrimental
impact on patient outcomes, potentially contributing to or exacerbating health disparities among patients.6,7
This could be particularly an issue for people living with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (AD/ADRD), where continuity of care and communication between the care team is
paramount.8,9
The working conditions of this workforce, both wages and workload, have important implications for turnover
and overall well-being. In Aim 1, we will study the impact of wage changes, instrumented through minimum
wage laws and pandemic-related wage protections, on home health care worker outcomes, including wages,
turnover, and poverty. In Aims 2 and 3, we will study the impact of staffing regulations and unionization,
respectively, in nursing home settings, on the welfare of the workers, measured by wages, turnover, and
reliance on contract staff. We will look for heterogeneity in the effects of workplace policies on workers, based
on geography (urban vs. rural), and agency/facility metrics (star rating, percent Medicaid, percent patients who
are of a racial/ethnic minoritized group).
In each aim, we will take the next important step, which is to estimate how these workforce changes are
related to patient outcomes, including functional status, physical and mental health, and health care utilization
and mortality. We will focus our analysis on people living with dementia; over one-third of home health care
recipients and one-half of residents in nursing homes have AD/ADRD.10 This group is likely the most
vulnerable to staffing changes, training, and disruptions. We will look for heterogeneity in the effects of
workplace policies on patients by both facility (e.g.,profit status, rurality) and patient-level characteristics (e.g.,
race, ethnicity, sex).
This project will build the evidence base on which we can make informed policy recommendations that could
improve the lives of the dementia care workforce and their patients."

Project Summary
Program History: The Tulane School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine academic industrial hygiene program began
in 1980 with the hiring of the first two faculty in the areas of industrial hygiene and toxicology. The IH program offered
the MSPH graduate degree and was designed as an on-campus, evening-based program to serve local and regional mid-
career professionals who desired advanced education and training in industrial hygiene. In the early 1990s, a distance
learning component was developed using teleconference audio-video technology to deliver the program to a cohort of
students at the DOE facility in Hanford, WA. As the internet matured and bandwidth increased, the distance learning
program converted to synchronous, internet-based delivery in the late 1990s. This conversion provided an unlimited
expansion in the reach of the program, in effect allowing the matriculation of distance learning students from anywhere in
the United States and indeed, the world. The MSPH-IH program was fully accredited by ABET in 1996 and included
both on-campus and distance learning formats. Our program was the first distance learning program in industrial hygiene
to be so accredited. The MSPH industrial hygiene program is currently accredited by ABET through 2029. In 2006, we
also began offering a graduate certificate in industrial hygiene in response to a need created by new educational
requirements instituted by the American Board of Industrial Hygiene (now the Board for Global EHS Credentialing) for
eligibility for the CIH. Since the IH program began in 1980 and through May 2023, we will have graduated approximately
211 students with the MSPH in industrial hygiene. Of these graduates, 101 completed the degree in the distance learning
format. So far, 96 (45.7%) of our graduates have obtained the CIH certification from the Board of Global EHS
Credentialing, with five current students holding the designation. Of the NIOSH TPG trainees who have graduated, 50%
hold the CIH credential. Twenty-four of our graduates and one current student hold the CSP from the Board of Certified
Safety Professionals. In addition to the MSPH-IH graduates, we have conferred 32 graduate certificates in industrial
hygiene up to this point. Several of the IH certificate students have subsequently matriculated into the MSPH-IH degree
program.
Need for the Program: In a survey of employers and education providers commissioned by NIOSH in 2011,1 the
estimated number of OS&H professionals that employers expect to hire in 2011 and in the following 5 years was 25,000,
whereas OS&H training/education programs were anticipated to produce only 13,000 such individuals. The shortfall of
new graduates in OS&H in comparison to the estimated need is being exacerbated by the aging of the OS&H workforce
with disproportionate rates of retirement among safety and health professionals.

10977327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sarcomas are an immunogenic tumor type replete with tumor antigen experienced CD8 tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs). Surprisingly, checkpoint therapy that targets programmed cell death protein 1 (a-PD-1) to
reinvigorate CD8 TILs is largely ineffective in sarcomas and has not gained FDA approval. CD8 TILs experience
stress, but the stress response has not been widely studied in CD8 TILs of cancer patients. Under acute stress,
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) protects cells. Under
chronic stress, PERK activates a pro-apoptotic response that induces cell death. We previously demonstrated
that PERK is detrimental to CD8 T cells in tumors. We now reveal robust preliminary data that indicate that the
chronic PERK axis governed by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and ER oxidoreductase 1 (ERO1a)
shapes CD8 TIL fate in mouse and human sarcomas and impairs response to a-PD-1 therapy. Our data are
intriguing given the role of PERK to protect cells under acute stress through attenuation of translation. Indeed,
we found that the tumor microenvironment is a form of acute stress that inhibits translation in CD8 T cells through
PERK. However, in vivo in the presence of tumor antigen, the chronic arm of the PERK response appears to
dictate PD-1+ CD8 TIL fate. This proposal will formally test that chronic targets ATF4 and ERO1a drive activation
and metabolic exhaustion in CD8 TILs that limit the efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy, while the acute PERK response
protects CD8 TILs under sarcoma microenvironment stress. To accomplish our aims we have developed unique
genetic mouse models to analyze the T cell-specific contributions of the chronic and acute phases of the stress
response to shape efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy in sarcomas. In Aim 1, we will use LckcreRosa26-ATF4loxtg mice
with T cell-specific overexpression of human ATF4 and CD8 TILs from sarcoma patients to determine the
contribution of ATF4 to drive activation and exhaustion in CD8 TILs and shape response to a-PD-1 therapy in
sarcomas. The results are expected to reframe and advance our understanding of T cell exhaustion in sarcomas.
In Aim 2 we have created unique ERO1a-/- mice to formally define how ERO1a affects CD8 TIL metabolic
exhaustion and response to a-PD-1 therapy and we will use CD8 TILs from sarcoma patients to study the
contribution of ERO1a to human TIL exhaustion. The results are expected to produce a robust molecular target
that holds fantastic potential to improve the efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy in cancer patients. In Aim 3 we will use
our LckcrePERKf/f mice and Eif2aS51A mutant mice to elucidate requirements of the acute stress response in CD8
TILs. The results are expected to shape the direction of drug development surrounding the ER stress response
in cancer immunotherapy. Successful completion of this proposal will identify radical new chronic ER stress
targets that undermine the widespread success of immunotherapy in sarcoma patients and establish a new
paradigm that informs drug development for all solid tumor cancer patients."
10977427,"Our broad research goal is to understand chromatin regulatory mechanisms in nuclear and epigenetic
programs and how these mechanisms are deregulated in aging and disease. A fundamental mechanism for
regulating chromatin involves the reversible modification of histones by chemical moieties such as acetyl-,
methyl-, and phospho-groups. These different histone marks are linked to discrete chromatin states and
regulate the accessibility of DNA to transacting factors. In budding yeast, histone deacetylation by the
chromatin silencing factor Sir2 prevents genomic instability and aging, and in mammals, de-regulation of
histone acetylation is linked to cellular senescence and aging-related pathologies from neurodegeneration to
cancer. Here, we focus on SIRT7, a chromatin regulatory, lysine deacetylase enzyme in the Sir2 family of
aging-regulatory factors. This project will study new roles of SIRT7-dependent histone deacetylation in
chromatin regulatory mechanisms that are deregulated in aging and age-associated cancer biology.
Inactivation of SIRT7 in mice leads to genomic instability, shortened lifespan and aging-related phenotypes,
and preliminary studies suggest that increased SIRT7 protects against aging pathologies in mice. However,
SIRT7 can also sustain oncogenic transcriptional programming in cancer cells. Thus, uncovering distinct
pathways of SIRT7 chromatin regulation, may be important to dissect pleiotropic functions of SIRT7 in aging
and cancer pathways. Recently, we identified a novel substrate of SIRT7, acetylated lysine K36 of histone H3
(H3K36ac), which is dramatically hyper-acetylated upon SIRT7-inactivation. H3K36ac is implicated in
chromatin remodeling and DNA damage responses in yeast, but its regulation and functions in mammalian
biology are largely obscure. In preliminary studies we found that the increased H3K36 acetylation in SIRT7-
deficient cells is coupled to decreased di-methylation at this residue (H3K36me2), a chromatin modification
that has important roles in gene activation, DNA methylation and oncogenic transformation. Moreover, SIRT7
interacts physically with the oncoprotein NSD2, the enzyme that generates the bulk of H3K36me2 in many cell
types. Here, we will investigate a new model that SIRT7 clears acetylation at H3K36 from large swaths of
chromatin to help prime NSD2-catalyzed methylation at H3K36. In Aim 1, we explore the connection of SIRT7
and NSD2 in aging-related processes using genomic, cellular and mouse systems, and in Aim 2, we test the
role of SIRT7-H3K36-NSD2 methylation axis in driving lung carcinoma in vivo, using pre-clinical mouse and
human cancer models. By uncovering distinct pathways of SIRT7 chromatin regulation, this project may suggst
strategies to selectively enhance functions of SIRT7 that are protective in aging without promoting oncogenic
SIRT7 activities. Together, these studies should provide insights into fundamental chromatin mechanisms in
aging and cancer biology."

This is a competing renewal application for the New England Consortium Node (NECN). The NECN, led by Kathleen Carroll, PhD, of Yale, and Roger Weiss, MD, of Harvard, has a track record of outstanding productivity in the Clinical Trials Network (CTN), with leadership of 4 highly successful completed trials, high levels of study participation, excellent recruitment and retention, and 38 peer-reviewed CTN publications during the current funding period. NECN investigators have published the 3 most widely cited papers in the history of the CTN and are currently leading 6 CTN trials. With the recent CTN emphasis on SUD research in general health settings, we have added a third PI, Gail D’Onofrio, MD, currently leading 2 large CTN trials in emergency departments (EDs). The primary aims of this competing renewal application are to: 1) Continue to extend the NECN’s strong clinical research infrastructure into an even wider range of healthcare settings, and 2) Propose a series of studies in an array of healthcare settings to improve interventions for a wide variety of people who use substances, ranging from those with risky substance use to severe substance use disorders (SUDs). These studies, building on previous work of NECN investigators, address critical issues that face practitioners
throughout the healthcare system. Proposed studies include the following: 1. Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) vs. SBI with Onsite Computer-based CBT
 for Stimulant Use Disorder in Primary Care 2. A Randomized Controlled Trial to Prevent or Reduce Substance Use by Youths with Chronic Illness 3. Testing an evidence-based psychosocial treatment for stimulant use disorder and concurrent HIV sexual risk among men who have sex with men 4.

Our Node has developed state-of-the-art health information technologies that can be leveraged for CTN studies. The NECN has the ideal mixture of cutting-edge investigators, including national leaders in addiction medicine and specialty care; superb, research-friendly clinical sites; and a track record of innovation, leadership, collaboration, and outstanding productivity in the CTN. We have demonstrated our ability to conduct cost-efficient pragmatic trials of treatments that have
directly improved clinical practice. We have the scientific expertise and the clinical and research infrastructure to play key roles in a variety of SUD studies in both general healthcare facilities and specialty SUD treatment programs. We are well prepared to continue to play a key role in all aspects of the CTN."
10928808,"As the leading cause of inherited retinal degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects about 1.5 million
people worldwide. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is the second most common causes of syndromic RP,
and is characterized as an autosomal recessive ciliopathy with severe photoreceptor degeneration
occurring by the first or second decade of life. BBS has been linked to variants in 21 genes, with those in
BBS7 accounting for roughly 2% of all BBS cases. The overall goal of this proposal is to overcome two
major hurdles in vision research: 1) the ability to accurately recapitulate disease mechanisms and
progression for BBS7 in a translatable model system, and 2) the ability to permanently correct
disease-causing variants and restore photoreceptor cell function with high efficiency and specificity. In
Aim 1, disease mechanisms responsible for the onset of BBS7 will be examined by generating a retinal
organoid model system from human induced pluripotent stem cells harboring disease-causing mutations
in the BBS7 gene. In Aims 2 and 3, BBS7 variants will be corrected using prime editing tools and a lipid
nanoparticle (LNP)-based delivery strategy within the human retinal organoid model to study timing and
efficiency of disease rescue. Furthermore, the therapies found to be most effective in vitro will be tested in
nonhuman primates to determine dose, immunogenicity, and efficiency of Cas9 delivery into
photoreceptor cells in vivo. Successful completion of these aim will 1) contribute to our basic
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying photoreceptor dysfunction in BBS7, 2)
provide the field with a thorough evaluation of a targeted gene editing strategy to treat BBS7 in the retina,
and 3) establish LNPs as an ideal delivery system to limit cytotoxic and immunologic side effects
commonly observed with AAV-based delivery methods. Taken together, this work will establish a pipeline
for testing and optimization of therapies to treat BBS7 and other inherited retinal diseases, including
additional forms of BBS as well as RP."
10928258,"Dental caries is the most common chronic infectious disease globally and is caused by the formation of acid-producing bacterial biofilms on the tooth surface, which demineralize and destroy the protective underlying enamel barrier. Although the efficacy of fluoride treatments (the contemporary standard in caries prevention) is well-documented, the current prevalence of the disease clearly illustrates that fluoride alone is insufficient to prevent caries in many situations. Therefore, increased understanding of disease pathogenesis and exploration of novel preventative strategies are objectives worthy of attention. Regardless of the microbial taxa involved, bacterial acid-tolerance is an indispensable factor in caries pathogenesis. The known caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans increases the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in its plasma membrane in response to environmental acidification—an adaptation required for acid-tolerance and virulence. Preliminary data indicates that several other Gram-positive oral taxa, including the caries-associated species, Lactobacillus casei, modify their membranes in a similar manner in response to environmental acidification. This proposal addresses a number of currently unanswered questions raised by these observations. Aims 1 and 2 of the proposed research will determine the scope of this response to acid stress across the oral microbiome, in single
taxa or in a community setting. Aim 3 of this proposal will elucidate how these UFAs are protective against acid-mediated damage. These aims will be accomplished using bioinformatics tools, basic molecular microbiology, an ecologically-relevant and complex in vitro oral biofilm model, and mass spectrometry/lipidomics. Successful completion of the proposed research will answer pertinent questions regarding caries pathogenesis in a multispecies setting and is likely to open the door to investigation of novel anti-caries therapeutics which, while targeting acidophiles, function regardless of the presence and abundance of S. mutans. The candidate, Dr. Jonathon Baker, has a longstanding interest in the microbiology of dental caries. Upon completion of the K99 (mentored) phase of this award, his goal is to become an independent PI at a leading research university, where he plans to continue research on the modifications that bacteria make to their membranes to combat environmental stresses, while leveraging acquired data to develop novel therapeutics. A funded K99/R00 proposal will allow Dr. Baker to develop skills necessary to both complete the proposed research (training in mass spectrometry/lipidomics) and subsequently become an independent research scientist (training in didactic lecturing, mentoring, and grantsmanship). Dr. Baker’s mentors and environment: Drs. Karen Nelson (J. Craig Venter Institute), Anna Edlund (J. Craig Venter Institute/UC San Diego), Pieter Dorrestein (UC San Diego), Victor Nizet (UC San Diego) and Robert Quivey, Jr. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry) have been carefully selected to provide high-quality, diverse scientific and collegial support, as well as state-of-the-art facilities, to ensure successful completion of this research program and the proposed career development goals."
10928824,"Mucosal immune responses are key for the regulation of oral tissue homeostasis, but when disrupted will lead
to disease. Despite well-established appreciation of this general concept, specific mechanisms of oral mucosal
immunity are not yet completely understood. Mendelian diseases have been instrumental in understanding oral
health and disease by uncovering genes and pathways implicated in human immunity and mucosal homeostasis.
One Mendelian disease clearly linked to oral mucosal disease is Plasminogen (Plg) deficiency. Plg, is the
precursor of the active protease plasmin, which is the primary fibrinolytic enzyme in both intravascular and
extravascular space. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the human Plg gene (PLG) typically
lead to severe oral mucosal disease, suggesting a critical role for this protease in mucosal immunity. Indeed,
these patients present with fibrin deposition at mucosal sites and oral mucosal disease (ligneous periodontitis).
In ligneous periodontitis, excessive deposition of fibrin is hypothesized to lead to severe soft tissue and alveolar
bone destruction, and often results in the loss of the entire dentition in adolescence. However, the mechanistic
link between mucosal fibrin deposition and immunopathology is not yet understood. Mucosal inflammation and
fibrin deposition in areas surrounding the dentition and destruction of underlying bone are also the hallmarks of
the common form of periodontitis. Based on extensive preliminary data, Dr. Silva has formulated a central
hypothesis that mucosal fibrin deposition promotes periodontitis progression through the local engagement and
activation of infiltrating neutrophils. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Silva will pursue three specific aims: (1) Determine
the role of neutrophil-fibrin engagement in periodontal bone loss under compromised and normal fibrinolytic
conditions; (2) Determine the contribution of fibrin-neutrophil engagement for the induction of neutrophil effector
functions in vitro; and (3) Pharmacologically target fibrin-neutrophil effector functions to prevent periodontitis
bone loss. The mentored phase of this research will be conducted in the laboratories of Dr. Silva’s primary
mentors, Drs. Moutsopoulos and Bugge at NIDCR, which have all required equipment and facilities in addition
to an excellent intellectual environment for periodontal and fibrinolysis research. For scientific research training
and to help with her career growth, Dr. Silva has assembled a strong advisory committee to enhance her
knowledge in fibrin biology, immunology and neutrophil biology. She has also assembled an expert consultant
team to help her develop new research skills including live cell imaging and computer-based image analysis. In
addition, Dr. Silva will attend seminars, workshops and courses provided at NIH to improve her scientific
communication, grant writing, mentoring and leadership skills. This research, along with specific training
activities, will generate publications and preliminary data to help Dr. Silva to achieve her career goal of becoming
an independent researcher in the field of oral health and disease."
10975378,"Craniofacial developmental disorders such as cleft palate and retrognathia (smaller lower jaw) often arise due to
defects in neural crest cell development and affect 1 in 700 and 1 in 1,500 live human births, respectively. Cleft
palate and retrognathia often present with other craniofacial anomalies in conditions such as Treacher Collins
syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome. Although genetic analyses have identified the genes responsible for some
craniofacial anomalies, the vast majority have an undiagnosed molecular etiology and cellular pathogenesis. In
an ENU mutagenesis screen, the Med23 gene was identified to be critical for craniofacial development. A point
mutation in Med23 results in craniofacial and vascular defects, leading to embryonic lethality at mid-gestation.
Med23 belongs to the tail module of the Mediator complex, which is a global transcription coregulator for genes
transcribed by RNA Polymerase II. Med23 is ubiquitously expressed in mouse embryos, thereby, raising an
important question of how a ubiquitously expressed protein regulates tissue specific development during
embryogenesis, particularly in craniofacial development. To understand the function of Med23 in craniofacial
and neural crest cell development, I generated neural crest cell specific conditional knockouts of Med23 that
exhibit cleft palate, retrognathia, glossoptosis and cleidocranial dysplasia. Interestingly, endothelial cell specific
conditional knockouts of Med23 also result in craniofacial defects together with vascular defects. In this proposal,
I will test the overarching hypothesis that Med23 and other tail module subunits of Mediator have important and
distinct transcriptional regulatory functions in craniofacial development via the control of neural crest cell and
endothelial cell transcriptomes. Specifically, I will address the following aims. (Aim 1) Identify the molecular
mechanism underlying the craniofacial defect in neural crest cell specific mutants of Med23 by analyzing
transcriptomic changes in these mutants as well as by identifying Med23 DNA and protein binding partners. (Aim
2) Characterize the pathogenesis of craniofacial defects in endothelial cell specific mutants of Med23 and their
underlying molecular mechanisms by analysis of the craniofacial transcriptome. Furthermore, I will test the
mechanism of Med23-mediated control of key regulatory genes that function in craniofacial development and
are linked to craniofacial disorders. Specifically, I will investigate the molecular basis of Med23 function via its
control of Runx2 and β-Catenin in the mandibular mesenchyme. (Aim 3) Generate and characterize loss of
function mutants of the Mediator tail submodule protein, Med24. The broad impact of this innovative proposal
will advance our mechanistic understanding of the gene and protein networks underlying the function of global
transcription co-factor Mediator complex proteins in fundamental cellular processes and development."
10819566,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and
worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are
legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United
States increased to over 3.3 million in 2020 and is expected to be >110 million worldwide by 2040. POAG
is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians
use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field (VF)
testing are the clinical standard for measuring the structural (OCT) and functional (VF) changes
associated with the development and progression of POAG. Combining data from these sources as well
as information about patient demographics, medical history, and clinical measurements is critical to is
critical in detecting glaucoma early, identifying signs of progression, and selecting appropriate treatment.
Recent progress in AI and deep learning (DL) have provided tools to build predictive multimodal, models
that incorporate multiple different types to make predictions. A central hypothesis of this updated research
plan is that applying multimodal, longitudinal DL to clinical measurements, VF testing, and OCT imaging
will improve the accuracy of predicting progressive structural and functional changes in glaucoma. This
updated plan builds on the original research proposal by incorporating new methods and datasets. With
this update, there is even greater potential to improve care and preserve vision by helping clinicians tailor
glaucoma management to individual patients.
This proposal also summarizes the research, training, and career development achievements made the
K99 phase of the award. Working with my mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, I was able to conduct and publish
impactful research during my K99 phase. I was also able to complete the training and career development
objectives laid out in the original proposal. During the mentored phase, I helped developed infrastructure
and secure access to real-world clinical datasets that will allow me to make immediate progress on the
proposed research. This proposed R00 transition will put me in an ideal position to research, publish,
mentor, secure funding, and advance my career as an independent investigator."
10975160,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) have long been considered as anti-fibrotic drugs for
treatment of heart failure. Although MRAs also have therapeutic benefits on skeletal muscle pathology in
mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), their effects on skeletal muscle fibroblasts have never
been defined. Fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix proteins that constitute fibrosis that replaces muscle
tissue that leads to loss of ambulation, respiratory insufficiency and cardiomyopathy in DMD. Both MRAs and
genetic deletion of MR in myofibers lead to reduced fibrosis in dystrophic models. In contrast, deletion of MR
from myeloid cells increases fibrosis in dystrophic muscles. These data support the overall hypothesis that MR
signaling has complex cross-talk between cell types in the injured muscle microenvironment that ultimately
regulates fibrosis. The endogenous MR agonist aldosterone increases proliferation and migration of cardiac
and renal fibroblasts, which is prevented by MRAs. Recent data support that fibroblasts differ between organs,
preventing extrapolating conclusions from one tissue to another. In addition to its role in disease, fibrosis is
essential for homeostasis of organ structure and wound healing. MRAs reduce the kinetics of acute injury
repair in normal muscle, supporting a normal role for MR signaling in skeletal muscle wound healing. In this
application, we will identify fibroblast regulation through non-fibroblast MR signaling and directly through
fibroblast MR signaling in muscle wound healing and muscular dystrophy. We will compare molecular
signatures, proliferation, migration, and activity between fibroblasts isolated from dystrophic mice treated with
MRAs or untreated. We will compare these mechanisms in more fibrotic dystrophic diaphragm with less fibrotic
limb muscles. To define mechanisms of MR signaling in essential fibrosis during wound healing versus chronic
fibrosis during disease, we will compare fibroblasts isolated from mice with myofiber and myeloid MR
knockouts in dystrophic muscles and in acutely injured wild-type muscles. Single-cell RNA-sequencing will be
used to identify MRA effects on mononuclear cell populations in acute injury versus dystrophy. We will perform
co-culture and conditioned media experiments with MR knockout and control myeloid cells or myotubes with
fibroblasts to identify MR-regulated cross talk between these cell types. Direct MR signaling in skeletal muscle
fibroblasts, different signaling in resolving fibrosis in wound healing versus chronic fibrosis in dystrophy,
between dystrophic muscles with different fibrosis levels, or between young and old muscles have never been
studied. Fibroblasts isolated from young and old mdx diaphragms and limb muscles and acutely-injured wild-
type muscles will be treated with increasing dosages of aldosterone with or without an MRA and gene
expression, proliferation, migration and activity will be compared. A fibroblast specific MR knockout will be
generated for in vivo validation. These studies will define direct and indirect effects of MRAs on muscle
fibroblasts to optimize MR modulation for DMD, other muscle diseases and possibly for acute muscle injuries."
10975177,"ABSTRACT
While the use of intensive insulin therapy has reduced maternal and fetal mortality associated with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, the risk of diabetes-related pregnancy morbidity remains high. Rates of pre-
existing diabetes in pregnancy in the United States have increased 30% over the past 5 years, driven by a
dramatic increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the obstetric population. The risk of pregnancy
complications in diabetes is directly related to hyperglycemia; thus, guidelines recommend lower glycemic
targets in pregnancy than outside pregnancy. However, these intensified pregnancy targets are extremely
difficult to attain due to the risk of hypoglycemia, dynamic changes in insulin resistance across gestation, and
the constant vigilance required for intensive insulin self-management during pregnancy. Unfortunately,
pregnant individuals have been systematically excluded from trials of novel automated insulin delivery systems
that have the potential to address the challenges of glycemic management and improve outcomes in diabetes-
affected pregnancy.
The iLet Bionic Pancreas is an FDA-approved automated insulin delivery system that improves glycemic
control and reduces the burden of diabetes management in people with type 1 diabetes. The device is
distinguished from other available systems because it is initiated with only the patient’s weight and eliminates
the need for carbohydrate counting or user-initiated correction boluses. However, like all other available
automated insulin delivery systems, the device was designed for a non-pregnant glycemic target range of 70-
180 mg/dl rather than the pregnancy glycemic target range of 63-140 mg/dl. We now propose to make
feasible modifications to the iLet device to achieve pregnancy-specific glycemic targets in type 1 and
type 2 diabetes. In Aim 1, we will conduct a 5-week crossover trial in non-pregnant individuals (N=20, 10 each
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes) to optimize iLet settings for the achievement of pregnancy-specific glycemic
targets. In Aim 2, we will compare optimized pregnancy-specific iLet settings to usual care in 36 pregnant
individuals (18 each with type 1 and type 2 diabetes) an 8-week random-order crossover trial.
These investigations will establish the first pregnancy-specific mode for a commercially available automated
insulin delivery system and will, for the first time, extend the use of automated insulin delivery in pregnancy to
individuals with type 2 diabetes. This work has the potential to transform the care of diabetes in pregnancy and
substantially improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes for the almost 40,000 pregnancies affected by
type 1 and type 2 diabetes yearly in the United States."
10975184,"Project Summary
Myotonic dystrophy type 2 is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting and
weakness that is caused by long CCTG DNA repeats. Individuals can have up to 11,000 CCTG repeats
within the CNBP gene responsible for disease. The proposed project will elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of CCTG repeat instability with a specific focus on large-scale contractions and DNA
breakage using budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a model organism. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms of contractions is important to evaluate whether manipulating this process would be a
viable approach to treat repeat expansion disease. We will evaluate the role of genes involved in the
mismatch repair pathway on large-scale contractions. We will carry out genetic analysis of double
mutants and specific point mutants that are candidates for study because of their role in protein binding
domains or implications from human genome wide association studies. Recently, my lab showed that
disease-associated lengths of CCTG repeats cause chromosomal fragility in vivo. This project will
elucidate how variables such as genomic location and DNA replication dynamics affect CCTG DNA
fragility, which has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of expansions and
chromosomal translocations. Finally, we will investigate CCTG repeat-associated gene expression from
a distinct angle by characterizing differential effects of repeat length and orientation on steady-state
transcript levels and RNA splicing. Altogether, the proposed studies will provide fundamental insights
into the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication, repair, and transcription that underlie the etiology of
the tetranucleotide expansion disease DM2."
10975212,"The goal of this application is to elucidate the basic mechanisms by which gonadal and/or genetic sex program
the sex-specific response to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) bazedoxifene to protect
pancreatic islet β cells. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease affecting the function of pancreatic
islet β cells. Evidence has shown that sex affects T2D pathogenesis, including β cell failure. The mechanisms
that drive this male predominance in β cell failure are unknown. Sex differences in biology and disease are
due to either sex chromosome X Y gene dosage, the developmental epigenetic programming by testicular
testosterone in the male and/or the acute and reversible effect of circulating sex hormones after puberty. The
study of sex differences in human islet biology and dysfunction represents a unique avenue to fully
understanding sex-based pathogenesis of T2D. The associated study of islets from genetic mouse models
will also open avenues that can be translated to other tissues. However, sex differences in human islet have
yet to be adequately studied and understood. Our overarching hypothesis is that sex differences in islet biology
(and in response to drugs) result from a combination of acute sex hormone effects observed only in the in vivo
environment and cell autonomous (sex chromosome or developmental testosterone epigenetic programming)
effects that are still present in vitro in the absence of hormones. We have based this hypothesis on previous
research and the new and recently published far-reaching preliminary data from our laboratory showing that the
SERM bazedoxifene acts as an ER agonist to protect β cells in females but not in males, where it behaves as
an ER antagonist. We believe that the cell autonomous and sex-specific genetic and molecular architecture of
female and male β cells (sex chromosomes) underly these sex-specific effects. The goals of the proposed work
are to elucidate the genetic and molecular bases by which bazedoxifene exhibits sex-specific beneficial actions.
This paradigm is broadly relevant to the mechanism of sex-specific activation of other ligand-activated steroid
receptors. Accordingly, the specific aims of this application are to 1) Determine the molecular bases by which
bazedoxifene acts as an ERα agonist selectively in β cells of females but not males combining human islets and
genetic mouse models and 2) Determine to what extent bazedoxifene sex-specific actions on ERα are
programmed by sex chromosomes combining human islets and genetic mouse models. The proposed work will
fill key gaps in our understanding of the fundamental genetic modifiers of sex-specific β cell function and failure.
It will also have a lasting scientific impact by opening clinically relevant avenues for sex-based precision
medicine."
10975215,"Project Summary
Macrophages as a key cell type in the innate immune system are involved in a wide spectrum of allograft
responses, but exactly what they do and by what mechanisms they affect diverse allograft outcomes
remains poorly understood. We recently reported the identification of Paired Ig-like Receptors (PIR) as an
innate allorecognition system that allows myeloid cells to acquire features of allospecificity and innate
memory in transplant models (Science 2020;368:1122), thus uncovering new opportunities in better
understanding and potentially targeting those cells in favor of transplant survival. However, outstanding
questions remain regarding the longevity of innate memory macrophages in vivo, how PIR-A/B receptors
are regulated, and the exact identity of macrophages in tolerized grafts. Now we have generated new
preliminary data showing that the chromatin structures at Pira and Pirb loci are strikingly different and that
they are controlled by distinct epigenetic mechanisms downstream of CD40 and PIR-A3 signaling
pathways. Furthermore, the anti-donor innate memory macrophages in vivo are incredibly stable as a result
of the concerted actions of CD40 and PIR-A3. The goal of this project is to dissect mechanistically how the
anti-donor innate memory macrophages are induced and maintained long-term, testing the hypothesis that
the “open” chromatin modifications at the Pira3 locus downstream of CD40 signaling pathways mediate
PIR-A3 expression via allelic exclusion and that the subsequent PIR-A3 signaling then programs stable
memory features of innate macrophages upon binding to MHC-I. We put together 3 Aims to test this
hypothesis. Aim 1 is to determine whether induction of anti-donor innate macrophage memory depends on
“open” chromatin remodeling at Pira3 locus downstream of CD40 signaling as well as the NF-kB pathways
involved (canonical vs. non-canonical). Aim 2 is to examine whether the long-term maintenance of anti-
donor innate memory macrophages requires PIR-A3 signaling, especially in driving epigenetic and
metabolic rewiring and cell survival. Aim 3 is to use a mouse heart transplant model to test whether
decommissioning the anti-donor innate memory macrophages is a fundamental mechanism of tolerance
induction upon targeting the CD40/PIR-A3 axis. We believe that studies in this application are addressing a
significant knowledge gap in transplantation, and the animal models, tools, and multi-omics approaches we
have developed in the lab put us in a unique position to carry out the proposed studies and move the field
forward."
10976930,"Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery.
While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on
predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be
even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer
chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some
cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac
contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart
and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+
can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate
arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins.
Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to
cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage,
calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable
to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cellby-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes,
but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high
throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile
motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will
be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated
microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test
compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will
develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs
representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response,
30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and
specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based
preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models
and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research."
10976960,"Project Summary
Long-term and chronic visual suppression to the visual input from the non-preferred eye is a key factor in
developing amblyopia, or “lazy eye”, as well as a critical barrier to treat amblyopia. Amblyopia is commonly
caused by misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), chronic optical blur in one eye due to unequal refractive
errors in two eyes (anisometropia), or a mixture of strabismus and anisometropia during early childhood,
affecting about 3% to 5% of the population worldwide. Our long-term goal is to understand how and where
suppression occurs in the brain. We propose that selective visual attention plays a role in visual suppression.
Our hypothesis in the current proposal is that selective visual attention biases competition between eyes and
modulates interocular suppression by selectively facilitating responses from the preferred eye and suppressing
responses from the non-preferred eye along the visual cortical hierarchy. To test our hypothesis, we will use
psychophysics to measure whether valid cueing of the stimulus in the amblyopic eye reduces suppression under
dichoptic viewing in adults with amblyopia, compared with invalid/neutral cueing (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will
use frequency-tagged EEG source imaging along with a behavioral measure of perceptual eye dominance to
compare the effects of selective attention and increasing contrast to the amblyopic eye on perception and
neural responses of each eye during binocular rivalry. We will simultaneously measure and compare the neural
activities along the cortical hierarchy of both eyes under the states of visual perceptual dominance and
suppression in adults with amblyopia and normal vision. These measures will help determine: 1) how and
where the brain suppresses visually conflicting images in amblyopia; 2) how an increase in bottom-up visual
salience by increasing the contrast input to the amblyopic eye changes the neural representation of the
amblyopic eye signal and 3) whether paying attention to the amblyopic eye has a similar effect on neural
activity as increasing contrast to the amblyopic eye. In Aim 3, we will use frequency-tagged EEG source
imaging coupled with visual psychophysics to measure cortical activity and behavioral performance during a
multiple-object tracking task with moving targets presented to one eye and moving distractors presented to the
other eye. This aim will comprehensively characterize: 1) whether visual attention modulates interocular
suppression by selectively facilitating neural responses from the preferred eye and suppressing responses from
the non-preferred eye along the visual cortical hierarchy (Aim 3a); 2) whether there are differences in
attentional modulation between normal and amblyopic vision, in terms of temporal dynamics (Aim 3b) and
attentional resource availability determined by the number of targets to be tracked (Aim 3c). The proposed
studies will systematically investigate visual perception and neural correlates underlying interocular
suppression to provide an integrated picture of visual suppression in amblyopia at physiological levels along
the cortical hierarchy as well as perceptual levels. Knowledge gained from our planned studies would help us
better understand how and where amblyopic suppression occurs and in turn, will help identify therapeutic
strategies for amblyopia."

There is a critical need to develop innovative strategies in early adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)
that develop self-efficacy and facilitate positive parental involvement. In the absence of accessible interventions,
we can expect adherence to diabetes self-management tasks (like blood glucose monitoring [BGM] and BG
review) to decline and glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) to deteriorate, as typically seen during
adolescence. The objective of this pilot RCT is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects of
incorporating the structured care of a pet fish into a family-based diabetes self-care routine combined with
communication skills training (Routine+CC) on HbA1c, BGM frequency and BG review in early adolescents with
suboptimal control of T1DM. The rationale for the intervention is based on three established principles: Social
Cognitive Theory, Habit Formation Theory, and Family Systems Theory. Participants in the Routine+CC group
will be given a Betta fish with supplies. Participants will be told to feed their fish in the morning/evening/bedtime
and perform BGM at that time; and perform fish tank maintenance activities once a week in collaboration with
their parent(s) and review their blood glucose (BG) trends with the parent at that time utilizing a collaborative
communication framework. The hypothesis is Routine+CC will have high recruitment, fidelity and retention
rates; and will provide activity-based cues to perform BGM and BG review, a positive competence experience
that enhances self-efficacy in performing diabetes self-care tasks, and an opportunity for positive parental
engagement in the youth’s diabetes care. The hypotheses will be tested by pursuing these specific aims: Aim
1: Conduct a rigorous feasibility and acceptability pilot RCT of (a) Pet Fish + Collaborative Communication
(Routine+CC) (n=20) which combines routine (pairing fish care with family-based diabetes self-care tasks) and
collaborative communication (family will receive training on collaborative communication skills); (b) Pet Fish
(Routine) (n=20) which only has the routine; as compared to (c) Control (n=20) which is usual care. Obtain
quantitative and qualitative feedback on feasibility (recruitment, fidelity, retention) and adolescent/caregiver
acceptability; and Aim 2: Assess the preliminary effects of the Routine+CC intervention on HbA1c, BGM
frequency and adherence to weekly BG review at intervention completion (12 weeks) plus a follow-up period (12
weeks). Examine whether Routine+CC changes the hypothesized target mechanisms (parental involvement,
diabetes self-efficacy, habit strength) based on survey measures. This approach is innovative, because it
proposes a novel approach for youth with TIDM that is resource-efficient and home-based, offers new concepts
in habit-formation research and presents a potential benefit of pet care for children with chronic conditions. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide the necessary quantitative and qualitative data
related to intervention feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy data that will directly inform and ensure
the success of a subsequent larger fully powered multi-site randomized efficacy trial."

The development of distant metastases accounts for a significant proportion of breast cancer mortality; as many
as 30% of patients initially diagnosed at an early stage will eventually progress to metastatic disease. A key early
step in metastatic progression is an increase in cellular plasticity that enables a subset of tumor cells to lose
residual epithelial features and gain migratory and invasive behavior, molecularly reflected in the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). Considerable evidence now points to cancer-associated EMT as a highly
dynamic and reversible process with disseminated cancer cells exhibiting many hybrid intermediate states
(partial-EMT) proposed to possess the greatest potential for aggressive, stem-like, behavior. However, the
epigenetic mechanisms that control such phenotypic plasticity and the role of this process in early invasion
remain incompletely understood. Recently we discovered that the local regulation of RNA polymerase (Pol II)
pause release by the histone methyltransferase SUV420H2 plays an important role in stabilizing the epithelial
‘identity’ of luminal breast cancer cells and in so doing, suppresses breast cancer cell invasion. Specifically, we
find that the local conversion of H4K20me1 to me3 by SUV420H2 enforces RNA polymerase pausing by blocking
recruitment of the MOF/MSL complex, which is in turn necessary for the acetylation of H4K16, recruitment of
pTEFb and Pol II pause release. We further find that SUV420H2-mediated repression constrains the
mesenchymal program in luminal breast epithelial cells, yet is directed to new sites upon TGF-β induced EMT.
SUV420H2 is downregulated in triple negative/basal subtype of breast cancers, and its forced downregulation
or inhibition promotes collective invasion in breast cell spheroids grown in 3D. These and other findings lead us
to propose that the relaxation of SUV420H2-mediated Pol II pausing control is one source of the epigenetic
plasticity and transcriptional heterogeneity that underlies breast cancer cell adaptation and the emergence of
tumor cells with invasive properties. Using a combination of precision run-on sequencing (Pro-seq) and native
chromatin analyses via CUT&Tag technology, we will determine the how the SUV420H2 mediated pause
constraints enforces phenotypic stability and how loss of these constraints allows for transcriptional promiscuity.
We will explore the role of the HEXIM1 / 7SK snRNP complex as a novel ‘reader’ of histone H4 modifications
and its role in SUV420H2-mediated pause control. Lastly, we will determine the impact of dysregulated Pol II
pausing dynamics on transcriptional diversity and the emergence of breast cells with invasive “leader” potential
in a 3D spheroid model of collective invasion. Over the long term, the results of our studies will provide important
insight into the mechanisms underlying epigenetic plasticity and its role in tumor cell adaptation, and a framework
for the development of novel reprogramming strategies to block breast cancer metastatic progression."
10977473,"Close to 75% of all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receive radiation therapy at some point in their
treatment regimen whether with curative or palliative intent. Radiation, which is currently given in a highly
localized fashion, causes massive DNA damage leading to DSBs and cancer cell death, yet on its own is not yet
curative. Indeed, while some cancers are intrinsically resistant to IR, others acquire resistance by upregulating
DNA repair pathways. Given modern advances in the targeted administration of radiotherapy, a paradigm shift
leading to curing NSCLC or other tumors could occur if tumor tissue could be globally sensitized to radiation
therapy. The epigenetic susceptibilities we propose to investigate here, may be the key.
The oncogenic JARID/KDM5 histone demethylase subfamily of Jumonji enzymes, which are overexpressed in
multiple malignancies, have recently defined roles in the DNA damage pathway: they mediate DNA repair by
erasing trimethyl marks on active chromatin harboring H3K4me3 marks, thus stopping transcription and
facilitating the recruitment of both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repair factors.
The novel concept we propose here is that JARID enzymes must be modified post-translationally upon DNA
damage, likely by radiation-activated ATM or ATR kinases, to enhance their histone demethylating activity on
active chromatin, thus providing a mechanism to stop transcription and recruit repair factors to these sites, for
cancer-cell survival. If true, this novel oncogenic activity of JARID enzymes would have significant
implications for developing new approaches to sensitize lung tumors to ionizing radiation (IR), by selectively
inhibiting the enhanced demethylase activity of JARID enzymes on chromatin. Our specific aims are to:
1.Determine if JARID enzymes are substrates of ATM kinases during the DNA damage response to IR:
 we will determine by mass spectrometry if JARID1B is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR kinases during the DNA
 damage response. We will map the site of phosphorylation and will mutate it to alanine (loss of function) or
 glutamic or aspartic acid (gain of function) to determine the impact on DNA repair dynamics, using isogenic
 cells lines expressing endogenous wt JARID1B (as controls) or null for JARID1B (knock out cells available).
2.Define how oncogenic JARID enzyme activity is modulated by post-translational modifications: we will
 measure the histone demethylase activity of unphosphorylated vs phosphorylated JARID1B enzyme in vitro
 and in cells. We will also determine the genomic sites JARID1B associates with in control vs. in cells
 undergoing DNA damage, and define if JARID1B recruitment to DSBs is dependent on phosphorylation.
Our study will thus have wide impact to lung cancer patients by providing the molecular and mechanistic
foundation for hypersensitizing tumors to radiation by using Jumonji inhibitors to curtail DNA repair through
blocking the histone signals that trigger this repair."

Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which
affects 20% of patients with breast cancer. However, 50% of patients with localized TNBC treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy display residual cancer burden after treatment and up to 25% of patients who
receive this treatment will suffer metastatic recurrence within five years. The poor association between
chemotherapy and patient outcome emphasizes two major problems for TNBC patients: chemoresistance,
where tumor cells within the local environment are protected and do not die in response to chemotherapy, and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, where chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor intrinsic properties and the
tumor microenvironment drive invasion which leads to recurrence. Previous studies have demonstrated that
cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are associated with chemoresistant TNBC. The goal
of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which the ECM contributes to chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis in TNBC.
We provide preliminary data that individual proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors drive resistance to
chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel and that expression of Cathepsin B (CTSB), a protease which degrades these
ECM proteins into small fragments, protects against the development of chemoresistance. We will dissect the
mechanism by which the protease CTSB and the ECM proteins it degrades influence response to Paclitaxel in
TNBC and whether these fragments can be used to track and target chemoresistance in vivo. We have also
found that chemotherapy treatment leads to changes in the ECM composition of mammary tumors.
Specifically, Paclitaxel treatment leads to an increased abundance of Collagen IV, an ECM protein which
promote invasion and metastasis in TNBC. Our goal is to determine the cell types that secrete ECM proteins
such as Collagen IV after chemotherapy treatment, determine the contribution of these ECM proteins to
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, and whether these pathways can be targeted to prevent the development
of recurrence.
Upon successful completion of the proposed research, our contribution is expected to be an understanding of
how ECM proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors contribute to chemoresistance and how chemotherapy alters
the ECM to promote recurrence and metastatic dissemination. These contributions will be significant because
all TNBC patients receive chemotherapy and metastatic recurrence is a current unmet clinical need. Results
from these studies will provide novel conceptual insights on mechanisms of chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis and will allow us to develop new strategies to track, predict and overcome
chemoresistance in TNBC."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. Standard of care is surgical resection
followed by treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). However, two major challenges make GBM
currently untreatable: 1) its diffuse invasion beyond the surgical margin; and 2) TMZ resistance that is tightly
linked to expression of the DNA damage repair protein MGMT. While perivascular niches (PVNs) extending from
the tumor into the surrounding parenchyma are believed to regulate invasion, recurrence, and poor survival, the
majority of animal glioma models are sensitive to TMZ and most do not express MGMT, making it difficult to
assess novel therapeutics in animal models that don’t display TMZ resistance. This Cancer Tissue Engineering
Collaborative project will develop and thoroughly characterize a multidimensional engineered PVN biomaterial,
study pathophysiological processes driving GBM invasion and TMZ resistance, and accelerate the evaluation of
novel TMZ derivatives created to target diffuse GBM cells regardless of MGMT status. We will use advanced
microfluidics to create libraries of miniaturized gelatin hydrogels containing margin-mimetic hyaluronic acid (HA)
and an embedded perivascular network. We also use a novel synthetic pipeline to create TMZ derivatives that
generate alternate DNA modifications that cannot be removed by MGMT that we hypothesize work in an MGMT-
independent fashion. Merging these technologies, we will benchmark an engineered PVN platform formed using
primary brain neurovascular cells for rapid evaluation of GBM invasion, MGMT expression, and TMZ resistance
amenable to analysis of cell lines and patient-derived GBM specimens with disparate MGMT profiles. To do this,
we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will use this
novel biomaterial to benchmark patterns of invasion and MGMT expression in GBM cell lines (Aim 2). Finally,
we will establish predictive efficacy of TMZ variants in an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 3). Together, we
will develop, characterize, and benchmark a tissue engineered PVN to examine the role of microenvironmental
selection pressures in the tumor margin on behaviors related to invasion, MGMT-mediated TMZ resistance,
recurrence, and poor survival. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the CTEC program, we will develop and
thoroughly characterize an engineered PVN biomaterial, show it fits within the continuum of existing cancer
models, use it to examine phenomena underlying the failure to achieve durable survival, and gain actionable
insight regarding novel TMZ derivatives with potential to effectively target GBM cells in the margins independent
of MGMT status."

Each year upwards of 14,000 patients are diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant form of
primary brain tumor. Surgical resection followed by radio and chemotherapies are the treatment options for
GBM, but patients generally succumb to the disease. MicroRNAs (miR) are emerging as key regulators of
cellular differentiation and proliferation; have been implicated in the etiology of a variety of cancers, including
GBM. Our exciting preliminary studies show great promise for exosomes shed from induced pluripotent stem
cell derived - neural stem cells (iNSC) expressing miR-124 to target brain tumors. In the mentored (K99)
phase of this study, I will evaluate the immune effects mediated by miR-124 delivered locally into the tumor
bed via encapsulated neural stem cells following tumor debulking. We hypothesize that miR-124 modulation by
exosomes enriched in miR-124 from NSC, when delivered into the tumor resection cavity will target tumor cell
proliferation and enhance T-cell mediated immune clearance of GBM cells. Once these effects are validated, in
the R00 phase of the award, the potential synergy between the modulation of miR-7 and miR-124, which target
AKT and STAT3 respectively will be studied to develop a sECM encapsulated iNSC delivered miR-7/ miR-124
therapeutic approach to target resected GBM. In order to ensure safety of iNSC implantation, the herpes simplex
virus – thymidine kinase suicide gene system will be incorporated. The efficacy of iNSC-miR-7/miR-124/HSV-TK
will be evaluated in mouse models of GBM resection. We hypothesize that dual modulation of miR-124 and miR-
7 will target the AKT-STAT3 signaling that is critical to tumor cell growth and together with the activation of host
immune system medicated tumor clearance will present therapeutic benefit. Upon validation, this microRNA
based therapeutic strategies will pave path to much needed novel treatments to target GBM."

Leveraging the technologies and infrastructure in our previous LungMAP phases, we will construct a multi-scale
map of developing acinar and alveolar structures during normal childhood and in the setting of childhood
interstitial lung disease (chILD) characterized by aberrant lung morphogenesis. Linked to gene variants, chILD
provides a unique opportunity to understand key genetic pathways and cellular interactions of human acinar and
alveolar development, in turn informing injury-repair associated with lung diseases throughout the lifespan.
Working in a collaborative LungMAP3 consortium, including other Research Centers, the Data Coordinating

high-resolution confocal and electron microscopy, patient-derived iPSCs, and bioinformatics including AI tools
to define, model, and predict normal and diseased lung development. The resulting mechanistic insights and
enabling technologies will be disseminated to the entire lung community via disease atlases and web portals, as
we have done during LungMAP1 and 2, to accelerate lung biology discoveries and disease therapies."

The long-term goal of this study is to develop a biomarker-based screening assay for the detection of
AD-related biochemical changes that can be measured in biofluids such as blood or CSF. The main goal
of this study is to identify phage-based probes to protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tau
that are associated with AD and its progression. This study will have multiple positive effects, including
more accurate diagnosis and improved ability to monitor disease progression. To accomplish this goal,
the project has one aim: Aim. Identify phage with high sensitivity and specificity for AD-related PTMs to
the tau protein in blood and CSF. Preliminary data from the previous grant demonstrated the proposed
method could differentially identify tau PTMs and differentiate between a pilot group of clinically
diagnosed AD and Control subjects in CSF. The current project aims to validate these findings in a larger
cohort of subjects, and extend the work into blood testing. AD diagnosis occurs relatively late in the
disease process, and many AD cases are misdiagnosed. This proposal addresses a significant gap in
developing robust biomarker arrays to assist in the more accurate detection of AD-related dementia.
Completing this study would be the next step to creating a PTM-based array of tau PTMs to improve
further the accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression."
10977292,"The B7x pathway in the tumor microenvironment
 During the first five years of the R01 funding period (April 2014 – March
2019), we produced 37 publications and received 3 granted patents. We made
major discoveries on function and structure of B7x, a much less studied B7 family
member that was originally discovered by us.
 Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have advanced
the treatment of cancer patients. However, one of the biggest challenges is that
the majority of cancer patients do not respond to these treatments. Clearly, new
strategies targeting additional immune checkpoints are needed to improve the
immunotherapy of human cancers.
 Our basic and clinical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest B7x
immune checkpoint has very different mechanisms and provides an excellent
target to develop new immunotherapies. Furthermore, we recently discovered
HHLA2 as a homolog of B7x and a new member of the B7 family, which provides
a unique opportunity to study a new human immune checkpoint. Thus, our
central hypothesis is that B7x and HHLA2, two less-studied members of the B7
family originally discovered by us, are critical immune evasion pathways within
the tumor microenvironment and are therapeutic targets for new cancer
immunotherapies. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three aims: 1)
Dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms by which tumor-expressed B7x
induces immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment; 2) Develop new
immune checkpoint blockade targeting B7x: Combination therapies and
mechanisms; and 3) Elucidate the HHLA2 pathway: A new homology of B7x. We
have generated a number of novel tools which provides us with unique
opportunities to address challenges and realize goals. The outcomes of this
project will reveal new immune evasion mechanisms in the tumor
microenvironment and will establish the foundation for clinical design of new
immunotherapies, which could potentially be effective in tumors that resist
current PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 targeted therapies."

EBV latent infection is responsible for ~200,000 new cancers per year. To date, there are no EBV-
specific therapeutic agents that selectively and efficaciously treat EBV-positive tumors. All known
EBV tumors consistently express one viral nuclear protein, EBNA1, that is required for maintaining
the EBV genome and promoting infected cell survival. We have developed highly selective, drug-like
small molecules that bind EBNA1 and block its ability to bind DNA, maintain EBV genomes, and
promote host-cell survival. Here we propose to better understand the mechanism through which
disruption of EBNA1 DNA binding leads to tumor growth inhibition, and use this information to identify
rational combinatorial agents to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy. We propose to enhance the
potency of the first generation EBNA1 inhibitors by attaching proteasome targeting molecules
(PROTACS) to selectively target EBNA1 for degradation. Finally, we will take advantage of new
mechanistic data revealing that EBNA1 functions as an OriP-specific endonuclease and resolvase.
We propose to develop new structure and mechanism-based inhibitors of EBNA1 that can increase
potency necessary for highly efficacious cancer therapy. By integrating these strategies to
understand the growth arrest response of EBNA1 inhibition (aim 1) to better develop rational
approaches for combinatorial therapies (aim 2) and develop next generation molecule with
structure/mechanism based drug design principles (aim 3), we will advance EBNA1 inhibitors for the
treatment of EBV-associated malignancies and related-diseases. We will test the overarching
hypothesis that EBNA1 is an effective target for small molecule inhibitors to treat EBV
cancers. The major goal of this proposal is to understand the tumor cell response to EBNA1
inhibition and to enhance efficacy of EBNA1 inhibitors to treat EBV-associated cancers more
efficaciously. The team associated with this proposal has the unique expertise and strong
collaborative history to execute the aims of this proposal. Collectively, these investigations will
provide fundamental insights into how EBNA1 functions at the molecular level and will lay the
foundation for the development of new strategies to treat EBV cancers."
10977396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Significance. Although national and philanthropic efforts have sought to reduce and eliminate breast cancer
(BC) mortality disparities over the past few decades, they have not only persisted—but widened. Additionally,
due to incomplete capture of recurrence data, no previous investigation has identified drivers of disparities in BC
recurrence following a diagnosis of early-stage (I–IIIA) disease. In Georgia, where economic and racial/ethnic
disparities are among the greatest in the United States, the sources of BC outcome disparities are unresolved,
and likely arise from the interplay of causal and contributing factors at multiple levels—from cell to society.
Approximately 40% of all BC survivors will suffer a recurrence during their lifetime, and clinical data suggest a
higher risk of recurrence in minority and low-income women. Given the high lifetime risk of recurrence, posited
race/ethnic disparities in recurrent BC, and documented mortality disparities across demographic domains, now
is the pivotal time to characterize underlying pathways contributing to inequities in BC prognosis. Innovation.
Our proposal is innovative in that it will be the first to estimate risks and rates of BC recurrence by demographic
characteristics, consider intersectionality in BC outcome disparities, and use a multilevel decomposition
approach to identify potential targets for intervention. Approach. Integrating multiple data streams (e.g.,
discharge, administrative claims, hospital, and census data) with cancer registry data from a large, diverse
population, we will identify proximal, intermediate, and distal determinants of race/ethnic, SES, and urban/rural
disparities in both recurrence and BC-specific mortality, as well as examine recurrence and its treatments as
mediators of disparities in mortality rates by race, SES, and urban/rural characteristics. Data will be from
approximately 30,000 women diagnosed with a first primary stage I–IIIA BC in Georgia (2013–2017) and followed
for up to 12 years. Impact. Previous research in this area has had consistent shortcomings including (1)
insufficient ascertainment of recurrence at the population level; (2) examining one or few factors without
accounting for shared contributions across multiple levels; and (3) inadequate power to explore intersections of
identity. Our study, for the first time, will examine multi-level contributors to race/ethnic, SES, and urban/rural
disparities in both BC recurrence and mortality among women with early-stage disease. Our innovative multi-
level decomposition approach will move us beyond merely documenting disparities, to identifying modifiable
targets within the social contexts of affected communities, facilitating prioritization of interventions."

Understanding the role of TP53 mutation in genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer
Women with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA carriers) are at high risk of developing high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (OC) but little is known about the biological mechanisms that underlie this susceptibility.
BRCA-associated OC is believed to originate from TP53 mutant cells in the fallopian tube, where precursor
lesions synchronous to OC and carrying the same TP53-driver mutation have been identified. However, early
precursor lesions overexpressing TP53 but histologically normal (called p53 foci) have been reported in women
without OC, questioning their significance to carcinogenesis. The goal of this grant is to elucidate the role of
TP53 clonal expansions in BRCA-associated carcinogenesis by using ultra-sensitive sequencing to detect TP53
mutations at a resolution never possible before. Using ultra-sensitive TP53 sequencing, we discovered that most
women, with and without OC, carry TP53 mutations in peritoneal fluid and Pap test DNA, but these mutations
are more abundant in women with OC and in BRCA carriers. We also obtained pilot data that indicates that TP53
mutations are frequent in the fallopian tubes of women without cancer, increasing in abundance and
pathogenicity with age. These results are consistent with recent findings of cancer driver mutations in normal
tissues and the notion of cancer as an evolutionary process that takes place through life. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that TP53 clonal evolution takes place in the fallopian tubes of women in the general population
but this process is enhanced in women with genetic susceptibility to ovarian cancer. As a result, women at high
risk of OC will carry more pathogenic TP53 mutant clones, which we can detect with unprecedented sensitivity
(>4,000 depth) using CRISPR-DS, a novel ultra-sensitive sequencing method developed by our group. In Aim
1, we will sequence TP53 in fallopian tubes collected at autopsy from 82 women at all decades of life from
newborn to centenarian, pioneering the discovery of the natural history of TP53 mutations in this organ and
providing a baseline control for Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will sequence TP53 in fallopian tubes of 235 women that
underwent prophylactic removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries due to susceptibility to OC, including BRCA
carriers and women with mutations in other OC risk genes or without identified germline mutations. We will
perform a comprehensive characterization of mutation traits (type, location, functional impact, pathogenicity) and
we will compare TP53 mutation frequency and traits with those of women in Aim 1, across groups in Aim 2 and
with standard pathological findings of p53 foci. For the same women, in Aim 3, we will sequence peritoneal fluid,
Pap test, and blood DNA collected at surgery to compare TP53 mutations in those samples with those identified
in fallopian tube. These studies will provide a high-resolution picture of the landscape of TP53 mutation in the
fallopian tube during normal aging and in women with OC susceptibility, improving our understanding of the
pathogenesis of OC and opening new venues for OC prevention and early detection."
10977399,"Metastatic disease accounts for >90% of cancer-related deaths worldwide, yet this phase of tumor progression
is the least biologically understood. The consequence of this lack of knowledge is that we do not have the
appropriate therapeutic arsenal to defeat metastatic cancer. New revelations for colorectal cancer point to shed
neoplastic cells into peripheral blood even from early stage tumors, suggesting this is why some early stage
tumors recur despite seemingly successful treatment. However, whether all early stage primary tumors shed
neoplastic cells, or if only subsets of more aggressive neoplastic cells garner ability to disseminate is not known.
This highlights the critical gap in knowledge of the mechanisms underlying neoplastic cell dissemination leading
to distant disease. Identifying the key features within the lifecycle of a disseminated tumor cell will unravel this
important step in tumor progression with potential to influence management of cancer care. Our study leverages
newly developed state-of-the-art phenotypic analyses of key attributes of a recently discovered neoplastic hybrid
cell in primary tumors and in peripheral blood, termed circulating hybrid cells (CHCs), supported by cutting-edge
computational analyses. Interestingly, CHCs harbor tumor-initiating properties implying that they have high
potential as effectors of metastatic tumor seeding. We will detail cells poised to disseminate from the primary
tumor into circulation and seed metastatic sites combining protein, multi-omic analyses and functional behavioral
analyses. A focus on a stage II and late stage colorectal cancer cohorts support analyses across the disease
axis, with an emphasis on stage II CRC patients with undetected micrometastases at the time of diagnoses.
Evaluation of the lifecycle of the hybrid cell from primary tumor to dissemination will provide biologic insight into
the metastatic process with great potential to impact the management and care of patients with cancer."

Many individuals living with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience significant cognitive impairments. These
impairments are more common in people diagnosed in early childhood, particularly under 5-6 years of age, and
are associated with measurable neuropathologic brain structure changes. Across the lifespan, these cognitive
difficulties can impact adaptive functioning, academic performance, and disease management. Strategies to
decrease the likelihood of cognitive deficit development are needed.
The study we propose in this application is designed to address current gaps in our knowledge regarding the
underpinnings of neurocognitive changes in persons living with diabetes. We anticipate that it would be
implemented by a multicenter collaborative effort of pediatric endocrinologists, psychologist, and radiologists
whose ultimate goals are to: 1) better understand the impact of T1D on the developing brain; 2) identify and
evaluate potential risk and protective factors associated with T1D-related neurocognitive impact; and 3) assess
potential associations between use of newer and emerging diabetes management technologies and
neurocognitive functioning among children with T1D.
With this application we propose two aims to achieve these goals: Firstly, we propose to characterize
associations of cognitive function and brain structure with clinical and environmental parameters in
children with T1D enrolled at 6-<8 years of age relative to healthy controls. Children will be assessed at
baseline and 18 months, with every 3-month interval clinical assessments including measures of glycemia.
Secondly, we propose to enroll a second younger cohort of children 3-5 years of age and follow them
prospectively with regular glycemic data collection until they undergo cognitive assessments and neuroimaging
at 6-8 years of age to characterize the relationship of early glycemic exposure (assessed primarily using
time in optimal glycemic range) to subsequent cognitive function and neuroimaging metrics.
With our application, the Indiana University Clinical Center pledges to work collaboratively with other consortium
sites, a biostatistics research center, and patient partner stakeholders to develop and implement a uniform
protocol. This protocol will entail recruiting diverse cohorts of prepubertal recently-diagnosed children with type
1 diabetes and healthy controls, following participants longitudinally, and performing neurocognitive
assessments and imaging. Success will ultimately be measured by the consortium determining mechanisms
underlying cognitive dysfunction in very young persons with T1D. Once modifiable determinants have been
elucidated, strategies to optimize neurocognitive functioning for persons with T1D throughout the lifespan will be
possible."

Diseases of the lung are a significant global health burden. To develop the next generation of therapies for
diverse lung diseases, system models informed by an ever-increasing repertoire of molecular omics, cellular,
spatial imaging, and pathological datasets are desperately needed. The LungMAP DCC is responsible for data
collation, re-analysis, and integration; secondary annotation tracking; developing tools to facilitate collection,
sharing and data dissemination; operating a web resource for data, expertise, and collaboration; and
coordinating activities across the Research Centers (RCs) and Human Tissue Core. The DCC also must facilitate
literacy for investigator use of developed tools and best practices for analysis, data provenance and metadata
annotation, and engage the larger research community. To cultivate future discoveries by the lung community,
we have begun aggregating a diverse collection of single-cell atlases for multiple species and diseases into
highly curated lung cell atlases as queryable datasets, with an emphasis on dynamic visualization, figure
generation, re-analysis, cell-type curation, and automated annotation. In LungMAP Phase 3, to support the
discovery of novel cellular and gene regulatory mechanisms, the LungMAP DCC will assemble, annotate,
analyze and distribute multi-omic catalogs of diverse lung diseases, expand and enrich our portal ecosystem
and lead community curation efforts. These resources will be deployed for broad reuse throughout the lung
research community. Our specific aims are to: 1) Advance lung research, education, cooperation, and scientific
dissemination efforts across the lung research community. The LungMAP Administrative Coordination Center
(ACC) will coordinate scientific and operational administrative activities to maximize synergies and research
opportunities within the consortium and with community partners. 2) Create a multi-omic catalog of lung diseases
leveraging LungMAP contributed and community data sources. The DCC will collect, organize and analyze a
large collection of LungMAP and community datasets to produce harmonized disease cell atlases and disease
focused portals. 3) Develop LungMAP.net into an extendable knowledge base of lung disease network biology.
The LungMAP.net ecosystem will expand to serve as a hub for research as a living resource and knowledge
base for normal and disease lung modeling through integration of agile AI-driven tools. Thus, the LungMAP
DCC will deliver a comprehensive corpus of standardized and integrated lung data and knowledge, to nominate
new targets for therapy, new regulators and disease subtypes.

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an immune mediated disease in which immune cells destroy insulin producing beta
cells of the pancreas. Yet, T1D pathogenesis starts even before damage to beta cells can be detected as overt
dysglycemia with the appearance of two or more islet-specific autoantibodies (AAb), defined as stage 1 T1D.
Yet, AAb number and type can be unstable overtime in stage 1. In the proposed studies, we determine
whether islet antigen reactive T and B cell clonal expansion is a stable early biomarker of disease activity in
stage 1 T1D. The central hypothesis is that islet antigen reactive clonal expansion of pathogenic cell subsets is
indicative of disease activity in Stage 1 T1D and disease progression to Stage 2 or 3 occurs when clonal
expansion within pathogenic cells exceeds clonal expansion within protective cells. We will address this
question by investigating well annotated cross sectional and longitudinal samples from the TrialNet Pathway to
Prevention Study. The cross sectional cohort will include age and HLA matched stage 1 individuals with stable
versus variable AAb in the prior year, Variable AAb will be defined as increased AAb number or change in AAb
as a longitudinal measure of disease activity. The longitudinal cohort will compare paired samples from stage 1
individuals who do or do not progress to stage 2 or 3 T1D. The approach leverages our expertise in islet
antigen specific T and B cell identification, cellular immunology of T1D, and systems biology single cell multi-
model analyses. Together, these expertise will allow us to define clonal expansion in protective and pathogenic
cell subsets of stage 1 individuals and explore the functional nature of the expanding cells. Specifically, in Aim
1 we will determine the degree of pathogenic islet antigen reactive clonal expansion that marks disease activity
and progression using single cell T cell receptor (TCR)- or B cell receptor (BCR)-, CITE-, and RNA-seq in
cross sectional cohorts defined by stage of disease and stability of AAb composition. In Aim 2 we will
determine the functional quality of clonally expanded cells in early T1D by assessing changes in the
transcriptome and epigenome over time of pathogenic and protective populations selected based on the
degree of clonal expansion, association with outcome, and enrichment in IAR cells. Ultimately, the knowledge
gained from this work will identify stable disease activity markers early in disease that may guide timing of
treatment, expand our understanding of immunity at Stage 1 T1D, and identify pathogenic and protective
features that may be targeted therapeutically."

The Montana Consortium for Urban Indian Health, a non-profit dedicated to technical and educational support for the Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) and their Centers across Montana, will utilize HEAL Initiative OTA-23-007 funding to implement the research and data improvement project “Promoting Wellness among Native Americans in Urban Areas.” The goal of the project is to support research into opioid use and integrated healing approaches in Urban Indian populations and provide insight into the efficacy of evidence-based and culturally integrated programs for opioid and methamphetamine use disorders and chronic pain in this population. Our project has three specific aims:   
1.	Improve population health surveillance data and clinical data to identify health gaps and disparities among Urban Indian populations in Montana;   
2.	Adapt evidence-informed interventions to address substance use disorders for Urban Indian populations; and   
3.	Pilot culturally adapted interventions and assess their efficacy. 

During the project, the MCUIH team will use multiple research methods to study patterns and disparities in overdose, prescription management, and chronic pain, and research suitable interventions. MCUIH will work with each UIO in Montana to select potential interventions and adapt them to the needs of each organization’s population and service delivery model. Interventions will be identified and adapted to meet the unique needs of Urban Indian populations, with a focus on culturally relevant and holistic healing methodologies. The project team anticipates that interventions could be Community Health Workers, Recovery Residences, Treatment for Individuals who Use Stimulants (TRUST), and pain-management specific interventions. After program selection, MCUIH will work with UIOs to support initial implementation of the chosen interventions. This deliberate approach ensures that the selected interventions are based upon enhanced use of population- and clinic-level data, align with community needs, and can be implemented effectively with confidence from UIOs and the patient populations of each community.   
 
The work by MCUIH and in collaboration with the UIOs in Montanan will help bridge gaps in care delivery and scientific understanding by improving access to data for examining patterns of overdose, prescription management practices, and chronic pain across UIO communities in Aim 1; adapting evidence-based programs for Montana’s 5 UIOs in Aim 2; and pursuing initial implementation by adapting evidence-informed models in Aim 3; and collaborating with other programs across N CREW. Achieving these aims will positively impact the health and well-being of thousands of Native Americans living in urban centers in Montana and across the country."
10976011,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use is a major public health concern that disproportionately affects individuals from socioeconomically
disadvantaged backgrounds. We propose the mechanistic hypothesis that childhood socioeconomic
disadvantage and other aspects of social inequality leads to neurobehavioral deviations, measurable in brain
structure/functioning and neurocognitive performance, that increases vulnerability to problematic substance use.
Critically, the vast majority of research has been cross-sectional and relied upon small, underpowered samples
of middle/upper-class White participants. In this secondary data analysis proposal, we leverage existing datasets
from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family
Research (MCTFR), population-representative samples prospectively assessed at multiple time points during
adolescence (ABCD) and from adolescence into adulthood (MCTFR). Multimodal and comparable
structural/functional MRI assessments in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts allow us to develop and validate
a processing pipeline for generating polyneuro risk scores indexing self-regulation abilities using whole-brain
association studies (BWAS). Longitudinal and comprehensive assessments in both the ABCD and MCTFR
cohorts allow us to examine whether these polyneuro risk scores mediate associations between childhood
socioeconomic disadvantage and substance use trajectories in adolescence and adulthood, and assessments
in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts, including family and community resources, household income,
educational attainment, occupation, discrimination, and COVID-related stressors, allow us to examine whether
more proximal experiences of social inequality in adolescence and adulthood affect substance use trajectories
beyond effects of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage. The racially/ethnically representative ABCD cohort
allows us to further examine whether socioeconomic status shows smaller effects for racial/ethnic minority
children than White children—the marginalization-related diminished returns phenomenon. Finally, the unique
twin family samples in both the ABCD and MCTFR cohorts allow co-twin control analyses that control for shared
familial confounders, permitting stronger causal inference than possible in samples of singletons. Understanding
effects of socioeconomic disadvantage and other aspects of social inequality on substance use trajectories is
more important now than ever, given rising income inequality in the United States and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, which disproportionately affects individuals and families from socioeconomically disadvantaged and
racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Identifying individuals and families at the greatest risk for problematic
substance use trajectories, and, critically, identifying the social and economic factors that potentially confer
causal risk, will inform the development of the most targeted, and therefore most efficient, cost-effective, and
efficacious, prevention and intervention efforts possible for substance misuse and use disorder."
10977026,"Summary. U.S. communities that are marginalized as a result of historic and ongoing injustices experience
persistently inequitable rates of adverse health outcomes. These communities will also disproportionately
experience climate-induced health impacts as climate change causes extreme temperatures, weather events,
and poor air quality. The community health centers (CHCs) serving these communities are uniquely positioned
to intervene to address these impacts. The perspectives of CHC patients, providers, and staff and other
community organizations working for climate impact mitigation are critical to developing strategies that CHCs
can implement to prepare for and mitigate climate-induced health impacts in the populations they serve. To
solicit these perspectives, the Community Catalyst CCHRC’s Community Engagement Core (CEC) will
conduct extensive community engagement activities foundational to the CCHRC’s central theme of identifying
effective CHC-led interventions to address climate-induced health impacts. The CEC will create, engage, and
continuously evaluate a transdisciplinary multidirectional learning community with expertise in diverse domains
relevant to such impacts, through a Community Advisory Board (CAB) comprised of three interactive advisory
committees (health system stakeholders, scientific experts, and community organizations focused on climate
change mitigation and environmental justice). CAB committees will collaborate to identify interventional
strategies that CHCs may implement to prepare for and mitigate climate-induced health impacts. Concurrently,
we will collect and analyze observational, interview, and focus group data from patients and staff at six diverse
CHC organizations to identify the mechanisms through which CHC-led interventions could mitigate these
impacts. The CEC will work closely with the Research Program Core (RPC), as the CAB members and CHC
patients and staff will react to the RPC’s Aims 1-2 results on asthma and hypertension exacerbation associated
with extreme climate events in CHC populations, and their emergent questions will inform the RPC’s Aim 3
analyses. CEC activities will yield a community-generated agenda for future CCHRC research on CHC
interventions to mitigate climate-induced health impacts and the support that CHCs need to sustainably
implement proven interventions. The CEC will disseminate and advance this agenda in collaboration with the
CAB and the RPC using diverse mechanisms, including supporting the development of proposals for external
funding led by CCHRC-cultivated community-researcher partnerships. This agenda, together with the results of
the RPC Aim 3 analyses, will inform the development of CHC-prioritized future CCHRC research."
10975083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growing evidence suggests that individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) are at risk for cognitive
dysfunction over time, with approximately 28% of middle-aged adults with T1D and 48% of older adults with T1D
meeting criteria for clinically significant cognitive impairment. Our team and others have shown early appearing
differences in brain structure and selected cognitive functions, with differing trajectories over time in children with
T1D. However, significant variability in outcomes remains unexplained, and there is debate about the
mechanisms and modifiable factors contributing to these neurocognitive deficits. Studying early cognitive,
functional, and structural effects in young patients with T1D before complications occur is a necessary step
towards informing risk factors, critical periods for prevention and intervention, and strategies to mitigate the risk
of neurocognitive complications of T1D later in life. Previous work has not been adequately powered or designed
to determine the effects of potential modifiable or protective risk factors for brain outcomes, how T1D factors
influence dynamic cognitive function in real-world settings and whether individuals with T1D from diverse
socioeconomic situations face greater risk for altered brain outcomes. We propose to address these deficiencies
by first engaging community stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to better understand families' perspectives
and needs. Their input will then guide the specific recruitment and data collection methodology that we employ
for this longitudinal study of diverse, prepubertal children with newly diagnosed T1D and their siblings without
T1D. In sum, this work will provide a definitive view of the complex risk and protective factors shaping
neurodevelopment in a diverse group of children with T1D and will help identify critical targets for intervention to
promote optimal brain and cognitive outcomes."
10977456,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This academic-industrial partnership (AIP) proposal seeks to develop a robust and easy-to-use clinical scanner
for tumor oxygen measurement (oximetry) in cancer patients. By knowing quantitative tumor oxygen levels in
real time, radiotherapy could be better planned and delivered at times when there will be an optimal therapeutic
ratio, thus significantly improving cancer care. The proposed approach seeks to leverage the unique capabilities
of the in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry technology that we have developed for
measurement in human subjects into a medical device that is ready for routine clinical use. The scanner can
make direct and repeated measurements of tumor oxygen by typical end-users in a clinical setting. The EPR
research team at the Geisel School of Medicine (Dartmouth College) has successfully demonstrated the clinical
feasibility and safety of EPR oximetry for measuring tumor oxygen in the clinic, and now seeks to expand upon
that success through a collaborative partnership with ViewRay®, a medical-device company that is engaged in
MRI image-guided radiation therapy. The clinical scanner will be designed to make it easier to operate by clinical
staff and sufficiently robust and reliable for its intended use in a variety of clinical settings. The following specific
aims are proposed to achieve the overall objective of developing an advanced EPR scanner for oximetry that is
ready to be manufactured and used in routine clinical care to enhance cancer therapy: (Aim 1) Design and
construct a 600-MHz pulse EPR system for clinical oximetry; (Aim 2) Fabricate a new class of compact,
lightweight, and advanced resonator designs specifically optimized for pO2 measurements in human tumors;
(Aim 3) Develop hardware and software interface with advanced measurement capabilities and user-friendly
operation suitable for use in the clinic; (Aim 4) Assemble, test, and evaluate the scanner for repeated
measurements of oxygen concentration using tissue phantoms and animal models of tumor; and (Aim 5)
Evaluate the efficacy, usability, and safety of the oxygen scanner as a medical device and validate its use to
make oxygen measurements in cancer patients and human factors engineering. The EPR scanner, fully
integrated with the hardware and software modules, will be evaluated in relation to its ability to meet or exceed
regulatory standards and for its practicality as a clinical device. The new first-in-clinical scanner will be a very
valuable tool in the clinic for accurate prognosis and development of effective treatment strategies for cancer
therapy. It can also be a valuable clinical tool for other clinical conditions where tissue oxygen is a critical variable
for decision making, e.g., patients with diabetic peripheral vascular disease."
10977457,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent studies have revealed an abundance of resident memory T cells (TRM) specific for viral infections in a
wide range of tumors, often outnumbering cancer-specific T cells. As these cells lack specificity to tumor
antigens, they are spared from the hallmark exhaustion/dysfunction of tumor-specific T cells. To this end, we
developed a novel immunotherapy which taps into immunostimulatory virus-specific TRM functions through
treatment with viral peptides to break the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Reactivating virus-specific
TRM with peptide was sufficient to restrict tumor growth in mice and when combined with checkpoint blockade,
promoted durable tumor clearance. Mice that cleared tumors were protected from tumor re-challenge, suggesting
anti-tumor immunity was established. Virus-specific TRM represent a major part of the tumor immune environment
and can be leveraged therapeutically, yet there is a clinically significant gap in knowledge regarding the
mechanisms of tumor clearance and how to optimally harness these cells. The objectives in this proposal are to
determine (i) mechanism of tumor cell killing and durable tumor immunity, (ii) the impact of viral specificity on
TRM function and therapeutic efficacy, and iii) define the optimal modality to reactivate virus-specific TRM. Using
both mouse and human systems, this study addresses an innovative perspective connecting antiviral memory
cells to tumor immunotherapy using cutting edge methods. We will complement mouse studies with
combinatorial tetramer staining to enable simultaneous profiling of T cells specific for an expanded panel of
viruses and vaccines in patient tumors. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of tumor
immunosurveillance and TRM function in mice and humans, and identify new target T cell populations for tumor
immunotherapy. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will provide a strong scientific
framework to expand the efficacy and utility of virus-specific TRM therapy, and enable the development of novel
strategies leveraging these potent immune activating cells."
10977385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer survivors are a growing population and their symptom burden is significant. Despite growing
evidence on specific symptoms and risk management strategies, efforts to translate knowledge into practice
have produced suboptimal results. Primary care is an ideal receptor site for breast cancer survivors, with
studies demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care based survivorship care. Nevertheless, over the past
decade, the emphasis on survivorship care plans and survivorship models has not had an evident impact on
primary care breast cancer survivorship care processes. Over the past two decades, primary care practices
have redesigned structures and care processes to deliver care to different complex populations; however,
breast cancer survivors are not among them. Many currently proposed and tested strategies are considered
oncology-centric and do not fit well within the real world contexts of primary care practices. Results from our
recent research studies indicate that breast cancer survivorship is not considered clinically actionable even
among primary care practices with advanced staffing models. Therefore, capacity building and stakeholder-
informed strategies are needed to enhance the translational potential of survivorship evidence into primary
care practices. This project uses a “designing for dissemination” perspective, blending the implementation
Exploration, Planning, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework and the primary care Practice
Change Model (PCM) as a theoretical basis for understanding multilevel factors impacting the implementation
of cancer survivorship guidelines in primary care. These perspectives help frame and identify mismatches
among existing policy, practice, provider, and patient motivators to translate the evidence into clinically
actionable primary care practice change strategies. Using a blended implementation/primary care practice
change conceptual framework, this project aims to: (1) engage diverse primary care stakeholders in identifying
actionable, practice-based activities for provision of long-term breast cancer survivorship care in primary care
using depth interviews; (2) prioritize, synthesize, and identify actionable activities for providing care to long-
term cancer survivors in primary care by engaging key stakeholders using modified online Delphi methods and
concept mapping; and (3) implement and evaluate actionable breast cancer survivorship symptom and risk
management activities using a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster study design with waitlist
control in 26 primary care practices. Study results are poised to have profound impact on implementation
strategies used throughout the U.S. to provide long-term care for patients with a history of breast cancer."
10977509,"Abstract
Cancer mortality rates in the US declined by 26% between 1991 and 2015, but the decline has not been equal
across all populations. Approximately 19% of the US population resides in rural areas; for over three decades,
this population has experienced increasingly inferior outcomes when compared with their urban counterparts.
The underlying cause(s) of the widening rural/urban gap in cancer outcomes is hypothesized to be multifactorial,
with socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual-level and geographic area-level likely playing a significant
role. Gaps in evidence include the use of multiple “rural” definitions, a lack of evidence on associated geographic
factors, and limited evidence based on multi-level approaches to understand the complex nature of rural
disparities. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the
underlying causes of rural/urban disparities in mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer. In the first aim,
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-level data will be used to examine mortality
among individuals diagnosed with cancer across three definitions of rurality, providing researchers and policy
makers with the magnitude of differences by each definition. In the second aim, SEER will be linked via county-
indicators to 16 databases (US Census Bureau, Area Deprivation Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, County
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, AMA Healthcare Workforce Mapper, BRFSS, Social Vulnerability Index, Health
Information National Trends Survey, etc.). These linkages will allow us to estimate the contribution of specific area-
level factors (e.g., area-level SES, access to high-quality care) on rural/urban mortality differences using effect
decomposition methodology. In the third aim, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort (U01 NS041588) will be linked to state level cancer registry data using the Virtual Pooled
Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS includes longitudinally collected data for 30,239
participants (44% blacks), oversampled from stroke belt/buckle states (56% of participants from NC, SC, GA,
TN, AL, MS, AK, LA) with large rural populations experiencing the highest mortality. REGARDS collects
information at the individual level on sociodemographics, health literacy, and distance to healthcare,
transportation, and risky health behaviors. Multi-level modeling and mediation modeling approaches will allow for
the examination of the contribution of individual-level characteristics and the area-level characteristics simultaneously.
Results will provide estimates of how much of the mortality disparity is explained by differences in urban and
rural geographic characteristics overall as well estimates that describe the potential impact of hypothetical
interventions on specific mediating factors. Findings will provide the critical evidence needed to inform policy and
intervention development aimed at addressing the systemic disparities in mortality experienced by rural patients
with cancer."
10978052,"The Lumbee tribe of North Carolina is a state-recognized tribe of approximately 60,000 enrolled
members, making it the largest American Indian tribe in the eastern United States and one of the largest tribes in the nation. The tribal homeland for the Lumbee tribe is situated in Robeson County, a rural county in southeastern North Carolina that ranks last among North Carolina’s 100 counties in health outcomes and is adversely impacted by social determinants of health. For the past ten years, tribal leadership has been working with universities and community agencies to better understand the health of tribal members; but to date there has been no intentional effort to develop a comprehensive research infrastructure. Data from the North Carolina Division of Health and Human Services Injury and Violence Prevention Branch indicate that American Indians in North Carolina have the highest rates of substance misuse deaths and emergency room visits of all the racial/ethnic groups in the state. North Carolina’s American Indian population consists of eight recognized tribes, only one of which, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, is federally recognized with access to resources from the Indian Health Services. This proposed 2-year planning initiative, led by the Lumbee Tribe, brings together an internationally recognized community relief organization (CORE), a state agency focused on substance misuse epidemiology and prevention (NC DHHS IVP) and five research organizations with national and
international reputation in community-based participatory research, substance misuse prevention research and policy development and implementation (UNC DPOP, UNC IPRC, RTI, WFU, UNCP). Our overall objective is to create the research infrastructure to develop and implement evidence-based, community-informed and culturally-appropriate interventions to address the substance misuse epidemic in the Lumbee tribe. Our team will draw on previous substance misuse programming in the Lumbee community to respond to this epidemic, as well as prior efforts to understand the health challenges in tribal communities, including the Native Pathways to Health and the State and Tribal Injury Data Sharing Summit in 2019. Our Specific Aims include: (1) Development of a Substance Misuse Research and Community Advisory Committees from representatives of the Lumbee community and from our five research organizations, with the goal of developing community-driven action research strategies to understand and address substance misuse; (2) Creation of a Lumbee Substance Misuse Data Dashboard and Storyboard to understand the epidemiology of substance misuse and community impact of substance misuse in the Lumbee tribe and identify key driving factors; (3) Formulation of a research training
protocol for Lumbee tribal members and ally representatives to evaluation evidence-based interventions currently implemented in the community and programming needs; (4) Laying the groundwork for an indigenous-informed cultural adaptation of an evidence-based pain management intervention to be pilot-tested among Lumbee patients experiencing chronic pain. At the end of this funding, we anticipate being well positioned to have a strong research infrastructure to understand and address substance misuse disparities in the Lumbee community.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and acute and chronic pain."
10978067,"A. SUMMARY AND SPECIFIC AIMS OF FUNDED PARENT GRANT
Hypertension is the most important risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and reduction in blood
pressure (BP) after stroke is associated with reduced risk of stroke recurrence. For the majority of stroke
survivors (SS), hypertension remains poorly controlled early after an incident stroke. In the United States, Black
and Hispanic SS are more likely to have poorly controlled risk factors after stroke compared to White SS, and
Black and Hispanic SS have higher rates of stroke recurrence compared to White SS. Prior efforts to reduce
racial disparities in BP control among SS have been uniformly unsuccessful. Multicomponent care models that
include multidisciplinary approaches show promise for improving risk factor control after stroke. Social
determinants of health (SDOH) help to explain racial disparities in BP control and stroke recurrence, therefore
multidisciplinary post-stroke care models that target SDOH may be key to decreasing disparities in BP control.
Limited access to post-stroke outpatient care contributes to challenges in developing system-level interventions
for post-stroke BP control. Telemedicine and telemonitoring may be ideal approaches for improving access to
care in SS. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rapid expansion of telemedicine for post-acute care in stroke
survivors; however, its effectiveness is unproven. Based on preliminary data at our center, we propose a
randomized trial testing an integrated multidisciplinary telehealth intervention, the Video-based Intervention to
Reduce Treatment and Outcome Disparities in Adults Living with Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
(VIRTUAL), in SS recently discharged home after inpatient hospitalization for ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic
stroke, or transient ischemic attack. The intervention will include post-discharge telehealth visits by a
multidisciplinary team, social risk assessments to facilitate social risk-targeted and social risk-informed care, and
home BP telemonitoring and management. The care team includes neurology providers (physician and nurse
practitioner), a pharmacist, and a social worker. Standard care will include follow-up with a neurologist and
primary care provider and pharmacist-assisted BP adjustment.
Aim 1: We will enroll 534 stroke survivors in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of a 6-month
multidisciplinary telehealth intervention to test the impact of the intervention on key clinical outcomes, relative to
standard care.
Aim 1a: To examine the impact of the intervention on the primary outcome of BP control (24-hour ambulatory
BP <125/75 mmHg) assessed with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) 6 months after hospital discharge.
Aim 1b: To evaluate the impact of the intervention on disparities in BP control at 6 months by examining
heterogeneity of effects on the primary clinical outcome (BP control) according to SS race and ethnicity.
Aim 1c: To assess the sustainability of intervention effect by examining the proportion of SS with BP control after
hospital discharge.
Aim 1d: To examine the impact of the intervention on a composite outcome of recurrent vascular events (stroke,
vascular death, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, heart failure) 12 months after hospital
discharge.
Aim 2: We will examine the impact of the intervention on care access and utilization, relative to standard care.
Aim 2a: To examine the impact of the intervention on the proportion of uninsured SS who have obtained
insurance coverage (including Medicaid, state programs, or commercial insurance) by 3- and 6-months following
hospital discharge.
Aim 2b: To examine the impact of the intervention on acute healthcare utilization (emergency department and
urgent care visits and hospital readmissions) 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge.
Aim 2c: To evaluate heterogeneity of effects of the intervention on care access and utilization at 3 months, 6
months, and 12 months according to SS race and ethnicity.
Aim 3: We will use predictive modeling to examine the independent impact of additional baseline SDOH
(neighborhood social vulnerability and segregation indices, food insecurity, experienced racism/discrimination,
healthcare-related racism/discrimination, preferred language, and social support) on 6-month BP control and 12-
month composite recurrent vascular events."
10977406,"A new immune checkpoint pathway in human bladder cancer
This proposal is in response to the PAR-19-183 (Biology of Bladder Cancer).
Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States.
The survival rate of bladder cancer has been largely unchanged for the last 30
years. Very recently PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were approved by FDA for the
treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer, but worked in only a subset
of ~15-25% of patients. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new and
effective treatment for bladder cancer. Developing novel checkpoint inhibitors,
especially inhibitors that target outside the PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, is
a promising strategy and may potentially have high impact in clinical
management of human bladder cancer. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is
that KIR3DL3-HHLA2 is a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive pathway
as well as a novel therapeutic target in human bladder cancer. Guided by our
published clinical and basic research and our strong preliminary data, we will
pursue following specific aims: 1) Investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of HHLA2 expression in human bladder cancer and APCs; 2)
Dissect co-inhibitory function and signaling of the KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway; and
3) Develop new immunotherapies against human bladder cancer by targeting the
KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway. This proposal comprises an integrated network of
multi-disciplinary collaborative investigators (immunologists, urologists,
oncologists, and bioinformaticians) to accelerate translational research and
maximize future clinical benefits. The outcomes of this project will reveal new
fundamental biology of human bladder cancer and will guide the rational
development of new immunotherapies for the treatment of human bladder
cancer."
10977415,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite recent advances in early detection and treatment, breast cancer remains a major cause of morbidity
and mortality. Native Hawaiian women have the highest breast cancer incidence in Hawaii despite their
favorably reproductive patterns. Japanese American women now experience the same breast cancer risk as
non-Hispanic White women Further, advanced breast cancer rates are considerably higher in Asian American
Women in Hawaii and the Pacific compared to the US mainland, 15% versus 9%. The absolute risk of invasive
cancer and advanced cancer in these groups of the US population is not known. Our long-term goal is to
develop accurate and validated breast cancer risk biomarkers that can contribute to screening strategies for
Asian groups with diverse breast cancer risk profiles who to date have not been well represented in breast
cancer cohorts and clinical trials. The Hawaii Pacific Islands Mammography Registry (HIPIMR) will be a
resource to identify and validate novel image biomarkers for the diverse ethnic groups of this region with
varying risk factor profiles including Native Hawaiians, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and other ethnic groups.
Combining San Francisco Mammography Registry and HIPIMR cohorts will give us the statistical power to
describe risk of invasive and advanced cancer in Asian groups. Our central hypothesis is that standard breast
cancer risk factors and image factors and their prevalence are different in the diverse populations found in high
concentrations in the Pacific (Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa) and Asian ethnic groups in the mainland US
compared to non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. We plan to test the hypothesis that
using risk factor profiles and next generation breast composition and texture features across Asian groups, the
fastest growing segment of the US population,9 and NHPI ethnic groups will improve cancer risk prediction.
Our specific aims are as compared to non-Hispanic White women: 1. Examine clinical risk factors and their
association with invasive and advanced breast cancer in women undergoing breast cancer screening by Asian
(Japanese, Filipino, Chinese) and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander (AANHPI) ancestry, 2. Identify next-
generation breast imaging characteristics from 2D and 3D mammography, including volumetric breast density,
calcifications, masses, texture features and their association with invasive and advanced breast cancer for
AANHPI women, using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, 3. Identify the
combination of clinical risk factors and image factors associated with invasive and advanced breast cancer risk
among AANHPI women. This study addresses the need for accurate identification of defined clinical and
radiomic risk factors among AANHPI populations and their relation to breast cancer risk to improve outcomes
for these women."
10977537,"While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there
is one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by
disproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often
diagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to
any other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is
undoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in
AI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas
Project (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients
sequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through
appropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover
novel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting
mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be
translated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian
participants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers
which show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers
(stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate
cancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop
culturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients
and survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of
cancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest
Tribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and

The cortical column is a fundamental unit of processing in the cerebral cortex. Within each column are
subnetworks of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and this structure is repeated across the
cortical processing hierarchy. We propose that inhibitory interneurons, through specialized circuits that can
result in both inhibition and disinhibition of pyramidal neuron firing, are crucial aspects of specialized
processing in cortical circuits across the processing hierarchy. To understand the roles of inhibition and
disinhibition in cortical processing, the patterns interaction among cell types must be related to the functional
properties of the local population.
Primary auditory cortex (A1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are situated at different levels of the
processing hierarchy. In the proposed experiments, we will compare the functional logic of excitatory and
inhibitory microcircuits in A1 and PPC, to determine the properties of local network organization that generalize
and specialize across sensory and association cortex. In aim 1, we will compare the spatial and functional
structure of excitatory impacts on local populations in A1 and PPC, by combining single cell optogenetic
stimulation with two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing an auditory localization task. In aim 2, we will
determine the spatial and functional properties of local inhibitory and disinhibitory motifs, by mapping the
influence of individual inhibitory neurons on the local population. In aim 3, we will explore more natural
stimulation patterns and their effects on cell-type-specific interactions. Together, these experiments will reveal
the computational roles of specific cell types in local circuits, and establish the similarities and differences in
the functional microcircuitry of sensory and association cortex."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) involves derangement in multiple tissues, yet the physiological drivers of disease will vary
and are difficult to discern for a given individual. This variability in T2D pathophysiology contributes to
heterogeneity in T2D complications and in which treatment strategy will offer optimum benefit. Together, these
pose challenges for clinical decisions on the optimal intervention. We and others have helped disentangle this
heterogeneity by advancing subclassification of T2D and identifying subtypes with different clinical risk, genetic
susceptibility, and response to interventions. However, multiple clinical gaps remain before T2D subtypes can
be used in routine clinical care, including a lack of racial/ethnic diversity in study populations, understanding of
T2D subtypes across the age spectrum, and integration of multiple different data types to provide comprehensive
understanding of the physiological drivers of heterogeneity in T2D. This application is in response to RFA-DK-
23-019, which seeks to establish a consortium to bring together investigative teams to improve classification of
T2D. We propose to contribute to this consortium and provide data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
Study, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, Diabetes Heart Study (DHS), African American
DHS, Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS),
IRAS Family Study, Action for Health in Diabetes Trial, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and SEARCH for
Diabetes in Youth. These 10 populations total 55,766 individuals (25% prevalent T2D, 8% incident T2D) and
reflect the diversity of the US population at risk for and with T2D, spanning ages 10 to 86 years at enrollment,
and include large numbers of females (57%), Black (21%), and Hispanic (37%) individuals. We have a
multidisciplinary team with expertise in biostatistics, clinical diabetes care, data science, epidemiology, genetics,
metabolomics, and physiology. We have led developments in diabetes subgrouping and novel computational
methods to estimate missing data that will be used as a framework for broader application in this proposal. Aim
1 will assemble, harmonize, and integrate clinical, genetic, metabolomic, social determinants of health (SDoH),
and disease outcomes data across these cohorts. Aim 2 will build and cross-validate data-type distinct and
aggregate models for classification of T2D subtypes based on clinical, genetic, and metabolomics data. Aim 3
will assess T2D subtypes with risk for cardiovascular disease (and subtypes coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure), chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and mortality. We will also
assess the influence of SDoH on these relationships. Successful completion of this proposal will generate
evidence needed to establish physiological drivers of and precise definitions for T2D subtypes. This work furthers
our long-term goal of developing more efficient precision medicine-based prevention and treatment strategies
for T2D that maximize benefits and minimize risk for adverse outcomes."
10976848,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that environmental factors causing somatic mutations during the lifetime have a
more crucial role, not only in cancer but also in other common diseases, including heart failure. Recent studies
have also shown that somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNV) accumulate even in nondividing cells, such as
neurons in the human cortex, resulting in thousands of sSNV per neuronal genome by old age. However,
genomic DNA changes in aging cardiomyocytes (CM) remain poorly understood. The accumulation of somatic
DNA mutations over time has recently been demonstrated to be a hallmark of aging in many human cell types.
The current study aims to determine the landscape and role of somatic mutations in aging and cardiac disease
by adopting a new technique that allow deep whole-genome sequencing of DNA isolated from single CM taken
from the frozen postmortem heart. The first Aim of this study is to evaluate the somatic mutational burden
(sSNVs) in aging CM genome. We will also compare CM mutational burden with postmitotic cells from another
organ (neurons) to define differences in accumulation rate during aging. In the second Aim, we will ask what
are the mutational signature and the mechanisms of mutation formation in the aging human heart and if the
heart mutational signature is different than the brain mutational signature. Further to recapitulate the mutational
signature and related phenotype in the heart we will directly induce oxidative stress in an in vitro culture model
of primary CMs. The final Aim will focus on evaluating the genotoxic effect of radiation in CMs after childhood
radiation therapy and the role of radiation in premature aging. The proposed research is significant for the
comprehensive, results-based development of strategies for understanding natural aging and disease
progression in the human heart. Together with the planned characterization of mutational signatures, the
anticipated results may provide knowledge to develop new strategies for preventing the heart disease
associated with aging. The proposed study is only possible because of a series of innovations that are, at this
time, uniquely available to our research team, 1) a novel method to isolate single CM nuclei from frozen
myocardium based on CM ploidy and nuclei cardiac troponin T expression. 2) A major breakthrough by
developing “LiRA” and “PhaseDel” algorithm to call sSNV and sSV confidently from tetraploid cells that
considers cell-specific depth distributions of DNA sequencing and allele-dropout rates in scWGS data. For the
first time, our study will reveal the landscape of somatic mutations, genomic changes during aging and after
radiation therapy in human heart muscle cells in a single-cell resolution. In the long term, this study will
provide insights that might allow blocking some of the mutational processes ameliorating age-related
myocardial dysfunction."
10976881,"DIVERSITY SUPPLEMENT- PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Diversity Supplement proposal is designed to prepare the candidate to become an independent
investigator and translational scientist in the field of addiction. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent,
debilitating, and heterogeneous disorder that is difficult to treat. The Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA)
and the NIDA Phenotyping Battery are proposed frameworks to better understand heterogeneity in addiction
with each deriving neurofunctional domains relevant to addiction. While there is some overlap in the
neurofunctional domains derived using the batteries (both assessments capture negative emotionality,
incentive salience, and executive function), the NIDA Phenotyping Battery measures 3 additional domains:
sleep, metacognition, and interoception. The Parent R01 will test the 3 domains of the ANA on subjective
response to alcohol and self-administration. Specifically, individuals (N=210) with AUD (mild-to-severe) will be
phenotyped using the ANA and will complete alcohol administration and self-administration protocols. While
keeping the integrity of the experimental design of the Parent R01 intact, the candidate will include the short
version of the NIDA Phenotyping Battery as a screening assessment in the parent study which will be
administered prior to alcohol administration and self-administration procedures. The purpose of the candidate’s
proposed research is to test the relationship between sleep, metacognition, and interoception derived using the
NIDA Phenotyping Battery on subjective response to alcohol and alcohol self-administration. The specific aims
of the supplement are to determine whether dysfunction in sleep, metacognition, or interoception derived using
the NIDA Phenotyping Battery are related to subjective response to alcohol and subsequently increase alcohol
self-administration. As an exploratory aim, the candidate proposes to examine the relationship between
candidate genotypes (e.g., OPRM1) and six neurofunctional domains derived using both the ANA and NIDA
Phenotyping Battery: incentive salience, negative emotionality, executive function, sleep, metacognition, and
interoception. This diversity supplement will position the candidate to be at the forefront of translational
neuroscience in the field of addiction and provide several training opportunities geared towards moving the
candidate along the path towards research independence. The training goals for Dr. Nieto are to gain expertise
in translational science in the field of addiction and professional development as an independent scientist."
10976477,"The long-term objective of this Pathway to Independence Award is to support candidate Dr. McCabe
in building an independent research program and to facilitate his transition into an independent faculty
research position. To date, Dr. McCabe’s research has focused on 1.) refining quantitative methods applied in
addictions research, and 2.) understanding individual differences in stress, developing self-regulation, and their
associations with alcohol use (AU) among sexual minority and non-minority communities. Dr. McCabe seeks to
expand his training in AU development, minority stress theory, and applied quantitative methods to a new
emphasis on intersectionality and sexual and gender minority (SGM) AU risk, machine learning and multilevel
methodologies, and ecological factors influencing AU disparities. This long-term objective will be achieved
through a five-year training plan involving a carefully selected mentorship team as well as targeted coursework
and hands-on training experiences. The goals of the proposed research are to 1) distinguish SGM subgroups
and intersections at heightened risk for AU (e.g., bisexuals and trans persons, SGM young women of color), 2)
assess the role of state policies in moderating AU risk, and 3) delineate moderators and mechanisms of
heightened AU across SGM populations within and beyond the coronavirus pandemic. The mentored phase
(K99) will involve cross-sectional analysis of the All of Us Research Program (AURP), a large (N=331,360) and
diverse national dataset. Aim 1 will identify heterogeneity in alcohol and other substance use behaviors among
sexual (1a; n=38,820 non-heterosexual) and gender minority (1b; n=2,660 transgender or nonbinary)
communities. It will then test race/ethnicity and age as intersectional moderators of SGM inequities (1c) and
state-level policies impacting SGM communities (1d; e.g., hate crime laws enumerating SGM identity) that
further differentiate AU risk among SGM groups. During the independent phase, findings will be extended to
address mediators and moderators of AU in the monthly AURP COVID-19 Participant Experience Survey (Aim
2; n=100,340) as well as the longitudinal, biennial AURP data that extends beyond the pandemic into 2027
(Aim 3). Aim 2 will test pandemic stressors as mediators of between-person AU among SGM intersections
(2a) and examine intersectional (2b) and multilevel moderators (2c) of within-person AU. Aim 3 will test
differences in post-pandemic recovery in AU among SGM intersections (3a) and determine pandemic
mediators (3b) and moderators (3c) of this change. Findings will serve as the foundation for an NIAAA R01
submission during the R00 phase focused on geocoded neighborhood-level factors influencing developing
alcohol risk across adolescence and young adulthood across SGM intersections. Mentors (Drs. Rhew, Lee,
Helm) and consultants (Drs. Grimm, Bauer, Raifman) are committed to the candidate’s training, each providing
unique expertise to the research and training plan. This award will support the candidate’s development as an
independent cross-disciplinary prevention scientist in AU disparities and quantitative methods."

10974735,"SUMMARY
Because glucose is the principal carbon and energy source for most cells, organisms have evolved numerous
and sophisticated mechanisms for sensing glucose and responding to it appropriately. Impaired regulation of
blood glucose levels, due to defects in glucose sensing, may cause severe metabolic disorders, such as
diabetes, and many types of cancer cells depend on a high rate of glucose consumption to maintain their
viability. Glucose sensing and signaling is of great significance to yeast, because it contributes to distinctive
fermentative metabolism of yeast, a lifestyle it shares with many kinds of tumor cells. Our long-term goal is to
understand how eukaryotic cells sense extracellular glucose and adapt their central metabolic pathways to
better suit the availability of this crucial fuel using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Energy
generation by fermentation of glucose is inefficient, requiring yeast cells to pump large amounts of glucose
through glycolysis. They do this by enhancing the rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism, its transport. Yeast
cells have learned how to sense the amount of extracellular glucose available and respond by expressing the
most appropriate of its 17 glucose transporters. Expression of the glucose transporter genes (HXTs) is
repressed by the Rgt1 transcription factor, which forms a repressor complex with its corepressors Mth1 and
Std1 and the general corepressors Ssn6/Tup1 on the HXT promoters in the absence of glucose. Glucose
induction of HXT expression is achieved through a signal transduction pathway that begins at the cell surface
with the Rgt2 and Snf3 glucose sensing receptors (GSRs) and ends in the nucleus with Rgt1.The general
outline of this pathway was in place at the beginning of the last funding period. It was clear that the GSRs
generate an intracellular signal in response to glucose that alters the function of the Rgt1 repressor by causing
proteasomal degradation of Mh1 and Std1, and that signal generation is receptor-mediated, because glucose
metabolism is not necessary for its generation. What was less clearly understood was how the glucose signal
is transduced from the GSRs to Mth1 and Std1. The Ycks (the yeast orthologs of mammalian CK1) were
suggested to be coupled to the GSRs and act as downstream effectors of the GSRs, but genetic epistasis and
biochemical analyses place the Ycks upstream of the GSRs. There are crucial gaps in our understanding of
how the signal is generated and transduced from the cell surface to the cytosol. Over the next three years, our
efforts will be devoted to filling the gaps and developing a new model for this glucose signal transduction
pathway."
10974737,"Project Summary:
Over 22 million people need treatment for illicit drug/alcohol abuse in the U.S. (SAMHSA survey), costing
the government $468 billion per year in related expenses. After alcohol and smoking, opiates are the
leading cause for those admitted to substance abuse treatment programs. Currently, there is an opiate
crisis throughout the US. Opiate abuse resulted in an exponential increase in synthetic opiate-caused
deaths from ~3,000 in 2012 to almost 30,000 in 2017 (NIDA website: Aug. 2018). However, individuals
attempting to overcome opiate as well as other addictions often relapse. Therefore, a better understanding
of the reward circuit, in addition to a complete understanding of opiate targets in the reward circuit is
essential. Here we propose to investigate the impact of morphine on a novel form of synaptic plasticity of
inhibitory inputs as well as excitatory inputs onto inhibitory GABA cells in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), the brain’s reward center. Within the VTA, dopamine-containing cells are involved in motivation and
reward. Reward is an essential component of survival, mediated by increased dopamine release from the
VTA. Drugs of abuse dramatically enhance dopamine levels beyond normal rewarding behaviors, but also
cause synaptic modifications on VTA cells, leading to the diseased state of addiction. While known that
illicit drugs cause modifications to dopamine cell synapses, neither normal synaptic plasticity of GABA
neurons nor how opiates alter GABA neuron activity is completely known. This, despite the fact that GABA
neurons are involved in vivo in both the perception and associative learning of reward. Therefore, this role in
reward makes VTA GABA cells nearly as important as DA cells to investigate. As opiates mediate non-pain
related actions in the VTA, our findings will paint a clearer picture of neurocircuit adaptations caused by
opiates and provide a basis for examining the effect of other drugs of abuse on GABA plasticity. The long-
term goal is to understand normal physiology and morphine-induced modification of inputs to VTA GABA
cells. We hope examining opiate-induced VTA neuroadaptations provides a more comprehensive solution
in our efforts to reverse addiction. We hypothesize that unique VTA GABA cells that express distinct forms of
plasticity that will correlate differentially to VTA GABA neurons that are either projecting or interneurons. We
further hypothesize that excitatory and inhibitory forms of GABA cell plasticity will be maladaptively altered by
chronic, but not acute, morphine exposure. We also will examine the potential impact of VTA GABA cell plasticity
based on the cells unique projections and impact on DA cells. Collectively, this data will provide a better
framework of GABAergic circuit role in reward, and morphine effect on synaptic modifications. We will examine
this hypothesis using single cell electrophysiology, Retrobeads, rabies virus, optogenetics, and single cell
PCR, etc. As currently there are no good treatments to address opiate or other forms of drug-dependence,
the identification of a novel target for drugs of abuse could lead to potential new avenues of treatment.

10975186,"Abstract
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental
factors. The genes that mediate disease susceptibility have largely been discovered. The importance of
environmental factors is widely acknowledged but their identification has been challenging. Virus infections have
long been among the prime candidates, but progress has been hindered by the narrow “candidate microbe”
approach and limited availability of large prospective studies. The present study fills this major knowledge gap
by combining the tremendous power of modern immunoproteomics technologies to detect antibodies against a
wide range of different microbes with world largest prospective birth cohort study evaluating the role of
environmental factors in the pathogenesis of T1D (the TEDDY study). The goal is to obtain a comprehensive
and holistic picture on microbial infections which are associated with increased or decreased risk of islet
autoimmunity (IA) and T1D. This goal directly addresses the founding aims of the TEDDY study. We have
assembled a highly integrative multi-disciplinary team with synergizing expertise in T1D, immunoproteomics,
high throughput arrays, virus diseases, metagenomics, virome analyses and advanced statistics. We use three
supplementary high-throughput arrays with full proteins as antigens to enable the detection of antibody
responses against both structural and linear antigen epitopes to increase the screening sensitivity. First, the
highest protein capacity Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) technology is used to carry out a
wide screening of antibodies against 2000 different whole microbial proteins representing 171 viruses, bacteria,
and parasites selected specifically for their relevance to T1D at a critical time-point of T1D pathogenesis, the
serum sample where IA was first detected (600 TEDDY IA+ children and 600 matched control children); Second,
the quantitative Multiplexed In-Solution Protein Array (MISPA) technology is used to identify infections and their
timing in childhood by analyzing antibodies to 400 best microbial protein candidates selected based on Aim 1
results from all prospective serum samples from infancy through IA (the same 600 cases plus 1200 HLA matched
controls at ~7 time points ≈ 12,600 samples). Third, widely used commercial Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and
other technologies are employed to confirm the microbe-IA associations observed on the MISPA platform (the
same cohort as used on MISPA plus additional samples after the initiation of IA to study accelerants of
progression to clinical T1D). Overall, the results from this well-powered study will shape the landscape in this
field as this study represents the largest and widest screening of infections in children who develop IA/T1D. This
information is not only crucial for the understanding of T1D pathogenesis and for opening new possibilities to
prevent and treat the disease by vaccines or other antimicrobial strategies but will also provide valuable
information on the timing of infectious exposures in the early development of children in general."

Early childhood is a critical time in brain development for later health and maturation. During this period of rapid
brain development, the brain may be especially vulnerable to dysglycemia and other metabolic conditions
associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The current project seeks to evaluate neurocognitive complications in
pre-pubertal onset T1D and identify potential risk and protective factors of brain health. Investigators at Joslin
Diabetes Center (JDC) and Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) seek to become a joint clinical center in the
proposed consortium to investigate neurocognitive complications of pediatric T1D. In addition, we will collaborate
with Boston Medical Center, an inner city safety net hospital, to ensure inclusion of under-represented and under-
resourced participants. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in clinical research and
advanced diabetes technology use in pediatric T1D, health equity, psychosocial and cognitive implications of
T1D, pediatric neurocognitive testing, pediatric neuroimaging, and brain development. In addition, we have
engaged a diverse group of stakeholders who will actively participate in the development, design, and execution
of the study as well as dissemination of results. In this consortium, we propose to recruit a prospective cohort of
600 (60 at the combined JDC and BCH site) pre-pubertal children, aged 4-8 years with newly diagnosed T1D,
representative of the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the US, and a normative control group of 300
(30 at JDC/BCH) healthy children matched for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Children will undergo structural,
diffusion, and resting state functional MRI, neurocognitive and psychological assessments, and clinical
evaluations shortly after diagnosis and longitudinally for 2 years. Structural and functional MRI measures and
neurocognitive and psychological outcomes of children with T1D will be compared with matched neurotypically
developing children from our normative sample, supplemented with publicly available data in large pediatric MRI
repositories. To facilitate comparisons, imaging protocols will be adapted from published standard protocols;
instruments for assessing cognitive function, psychosocial variables, and social determinants of health and
cognition have been curated from standardized collections complemented with specific validated instruments.
Clinical and diabetes management data will be assessed via record review and cloud-based data capture
integrating device data from continuous glucose monitors (CGM), insulin pumps and pens, and activity monitors.
As a member of this consortium: we aim: (1) to describe the impact of a pre-pubertal diagnosis of T1D on brain
development; (2) to link functional and structural brain changes to clinical and performance outcomes; and (3)
to assess determinants of brain health and identify targets for prevention or early intervention. In this MPI
application, we hope to advance understanding of childhood brain development, with potential for direct
implications for the clinical management of pediatric T1D to preserve neurocognition."

 Project Summary/Abstract
 Mechanisms of inter-organ signaling have been established as hallmarks of nearly every
pathophysiologic condition, where many exist as related and complex diseases. While significant work has
been focused on understanding how individual cell types contribute and respond to specific perturbations
related to common, complex disease, an equally-important but relatively less-explored question involves how
relationships between organs are altered in the context of an integrated living organism. Current technical
advances, such as proteomic analysis of plasma or conditioned media, have allowed for a more unbiased
visualization and discovery of additional inter-tissue signaling molecules. However, one important feature
which is lacking from these approaches is the ability to gain insight as to the function, mechanisms of action
and target tissue(s) of relevant molecules. To begin to address these constraints, we initially developed a
correlation-based bioinformatics framework which uses multi-tissue gene expression and/or proteomic data, as
well as publicly available resources to statistically rank and functionally annotate endocrine proteins involved in
tissue cross-talk. Using this approach, we identified many known and experimentally validated several novel
inter-tissue circuits. This was this first study to directly link an endocrine-focused bioinformatics pipeline from
population data directly to experimentally-validated mechanisms of inter-tissue communication. While these
validations provide strong support for exploiting natural variation to discover new modes of communication,
these serve as simple proof-of-principle studies and, thus has promising potential for expansion. As a result,
we have developed a series of in silico tools to guide discovery of endocrine interactions. Specifically,
pathway-targeted enrichments, Bayesian network interrogation and scalable machine learning. The goal of
this proposal is to closely bridge these computational tools with experimental methods to systematically dissect
mechanisms by which tissues communicate and how these interactions are perturbed in metabolic disease
settings. Given that we survey genetic variation to guide prediction of new modes of endocrine
communication, these findings are likely to be robust across diverse backgrounds. We will implement high-
throughput screening of specific tissue communication circuits which operate under disease-specific conditions
of metabolism (ex. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes), define which are conserved from mice to humans and
mechanistically dissect pathophysiologic impacts of endocrine communication through in vivo experimentation.
The success of these aims relies heavily on bridging computational and experimental approaches, justified by
the training and focus of the PI. Collectively, these objectives will begin with unbiased computational
approaches, validate using high-throughput in vitro assays and evaluate therapeutic potential of new
endocrine interactions using mouse models of disease."

Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased likelihood of mild cognitive dysfunction and altered
brain development compared to healthy children, which can appear soon after disease onset. Younger age at
diagnosis, poorer metabolic control, episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and hypoglycemic events have
been identified as possible risk factors, but how they interact to affect brain development, and who is most
vulnerable remain poorly understood. To investigate the impacts of T1D on cognition and brain development
without interference from puberty, this planned research will enroll as many as 1,000 prepubertal children, half
of whom were diagnosed with T1D within the previous year, and perform MRI and cognitive tests at baseline
and at two-to-three 18-month intervals. Biomedical data will also be collected. Outcomes include cognitive
function and academic achievement, as well as MRI-based microstructural, volumetric, functional and
physiological measures. Their relationship to glycemic variability and multiple biomedical factors will be
assessed. Differences in neurocognitive development between participants with and without T1D will be
compared.
Our team has successfully recruited large, diverse cohorts, including children with and without diabetes, who
have been followed over extended periods of time, recruited from multiple clinical sites, and assessed with a
broad series of biomedical tests, continuous glucose monitoring, neurocognitive and psychosocial measures,
and state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. With PIs and Co-Investigators with expertise in neurocognitive
studies in T1D, imaging in young children, management of diabetes in children, data management, quality
control, statistical analysis, cognitive assessments, neuroimaging methods, continuous glucose monitoring,
and stakeholder engagement, our team has the necessary experience to succeed in the proposed study."
10975301,"Project summary- Much of the control of gene expression is exerted at two points: assembly of the RNA
polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex at promoters and the successful advance of Pol II into productive
elongation. Pol II promoters are accompanied by an immediately downstream (+1) nucleosome typically
located just beyond the likely boundary of the promoter. It is often speculated that promoter activity is
controlled by this distinctive local chromatin architecture, which includes histone modifications and histone
variants specific to promoter-proximal nucleosomes. However, the roles that adjacent nucleosomes play in the
assembly of the transcription complex remain poorly understood. After transcription initiates Pol II complexes
elongate very slowly, eventually encountering the +1 nucleosome while associating with positive and negative
factors. Most of these complexes terminate while a minority advance into effective elongation and traverse the
nucleosome. The extent to which complexes achieve full elongation competence is a major determinant of
overall promoter strength, but it is not known how the +1 nucleosome barrier modulates the crucial competition
between maturation into productive elongation and termination. Our overall aim is to biochemically dissect
Pol II initiation and early elongation to understand the mechanistic basis for distinct outcomes for Pol
II complexes within the local chromatin context. We are approaching these questions using a nuclear
extract based in vitro transcription system in which transcription complex assembly and early elongation are
challenged by a +1 nucleosome positioned at a series of precise downstream locations. These nucleosomes
can include the histone modifications and histone variants typically found near promoters. Our current results
already provide important and novel insights into both the negative and positive effects of +1 nucleosomes on
transcription complex assembly. These effects depend significantly on promoter class (presence or absence
of the TATA element) and on promoter-enriched histone modifications whose function is currently unknown. In
the studies proposed here, we will substantially extend the present findings to uncover the mechanistic basis
for the control of Pol II transcription complex assembly by the +1 nucleosome. We have also found with
extract-based transcription that both the advance into productive elongation and termination can be studied in
single reactions. This will allow us for the first time to uncover the mechanisms and factors that competitively
drive both relevant fates for Pol II immediately following initiation from a promoter in the context of an
appropriately located and modified +1 nucleosome."

Heavy episodic drinking results in disrupted patterns of neural signaling that place an individual at increased
risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) systems, originating in the
dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), are highly alcohol sensitive and dysregulated by excessive drinking. DR 5-HT
systems are remarkably complex and form a network of distinct yet overlapping efferent pathways. These
subsystems, which collateralize cortically or subcortically, may regulate specific aspects of alcohol reward
and aversion. Ongoing work in our lab is focused on characterizing a DR 5-HT projection to the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) and determining its role in binge-like alcohol consumption. In this supplement, the candidate
proposes to build upon ongoing work from the existing parent grant to assess a subcortical DR 5-HT
projection to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). In Aim 1 the candidate will map DR 5-HT inputs to
the CeA, characterize their topography, and quantify their overlap with DR 5-HT cortical inputs. In Aim 2, she
will evaluate the role of this pathway in modulating binge-like alcohol drinking using chemogenetics. The
project outlined in this supplement is a non-redundant and logical extension of the parent grant that will
provide the candidate with training in stereotaxic surgery, chemogenetics, anatomical tracing, confocal
microscopy, and quantitative immunohistochemistry. This new skillset will add to the applicant’s existing
strong behavioral background and provide her with a solid foundation in neuroscience techniques. The
candidate’s goal is to continue her research efforts and education by obtaining a PhD in Neuroscience. Thus,
mentorship at this stage will focus on increasing her scientific repertoire along with her oral and written
communication skills. Emphasis will be placed on the candidate generating two first-author publications from
the proposed work and presenting her research at several scientific conferences. The tailored mentoring plan
and project proposed in this award will provide the candidate with the support she needs to reach her goal of
acceptance into a PhD program in Neuroscience."

 Studies in animal models have suggested 98% of the HIV reservoir to reside within the gut, yet most
studies of reservoir dynamics derive from peripheral blood. Unique challenges likely exist for purging the gut
reservoir as an HIV cure strategy. One of these is the high concentrations of the cytokine TGF? in this tissue,
as TGF? can have the combined undesired effects of reinforcing latency and dampening effector CD8+ T cells
that could otherwise recognize and eliminate reactivated cells. A second challenge for the design of a universal
HIV cure is latency-promoting effects of estrogen, which may necessitate different approaches for HIV cure in
infected men vs. women. In this study, we will recruit, among virally-suppressed people living with HIV
(PLWH), both pre- and post-menopausal women (who harbor different endogenous estrogen levels) and
clinically-matched men, for donation of gut biopsy and paired blood specimens. In Aim 1, we will characterize
at the single-cell level the transcriptomes, surface proteomes, and clonal expansion histories of the gut
reservoir cells, to better understand the mechanisms allowing for their persistence and to try to identify novel
biomarkers of these cells. In Aim 2, we will test ex vivo combinations of next-generation latency-reversal
agents (LRAs) – ones that have documented in vivo latency reversal activity and are promising agents to
achieve HIV cure through “shock and kill” – and use CyTOF and bioinformatics approaches to determine the
phenotypes of gut reservoir cells that do vs. do not reactivate in response to these treatments. These studies
will not only reveal how effective the various LRA combinations are against the gut reservoir, but also reveal
features of gut reservoir cells resistant to reactivation by these treatments which can be targeted using
adjunctive approaches. In Aim 3, we will develop and test “kill” approaches designed to eliminate reservoir
cells in the TGF?-rich environment of the gut, by 1) blocking TGF? signaling during recognition of infected cells
by HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, and 2) by transforming TGF? signal from an immunosuppressive to an activating
one, via engineering HIV-specific CAR T cells co-expressing a TGF?-41BB chimera. In addition to establishing
a better understanding of the gut reservoir and its maintenance (including through extensive comparison with
its blood counterpart) in both men and women living with HIV, this study will test multiple novel aspects of
“shock and kill” designed to eliminate the most abundant HIV reservoir in PLWH."
10833695,"The melanocortin signaling pathway has emerged as a key signaling system regulating normal body-weight
homeostasis and energy balance. Activation of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) by ?-MSH reduces fat stores
by decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Yet, the cellular mechanism(s) underlying
melanocortin actions remains poorly understood. Our preliminary data point to the importance of ROCK1 action
in MC4R-expressing neurons that is significant for the development of obesity in mice and humans. We found
that selective deletion of ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing or Sim1-expressing neurons significantly increases body
weight and adiposity. Interestingly, we found that ROCK1 activation in MC4R-containing neurons is required for
the anorexigenic action of melanocortin through suppressing AMPK. Evidence demonstrates that UBE2O is an
upstream mediator of AMPK that targets ?2AMPK for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we observed
that human ROCK1 variant (2824G<A, E942K) from a consanguineous population in Pakistan displays severe
obesity, and the mutant mice carrying the human ROCK1 mutation (E942K) are obese. We therefore hypothesize
that ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing neurons is necessary for the metabolic regulation of normal body-weight
homeostasis and energy balance and is linked with the UBE2O-AMPK signaling cascade for anorexigenic action
of melanocortin. Thus, an impaired ROCK1 signaling axis leads to energy imbalance, causing obesity. To this
end, we will (i) elucidate the functional importance of ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing neurons in the control of
energy balance; (ii) establish the mechanism(s) by which ROCK1 mediates the effect of melanocortin on feeding;
and (iii) explore the significance of the human ROCK1 mutation (E942K) in regulating energy balance. To
accomplish these goals, we will employ state-of-the-art biochemical, molecular, cellular, and metabolic
physiological techniques, including genetically engineered tissue-specific transgenic mouse models, mutant
mice carrying the human ROCK1-E942K mutation, Cre-inducible AAV, DREADD, and the rAAV-FlexON switch
system. These studies will provide a unique opportunity to establish a novel mechanism implicating ROCK1 as
a key determinant of hypothalamic energy balance. The data generated from these timely studies may offer
further insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-linked metabolic diseases and lead to new therapeutic targets
for the treatment of obesity."
10975711,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe affective disorder impacting millions of women worldwide,
thought to be due to impaired sensitivity to hormone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Low-dose selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for PMDD, but their mechanism in PMDD is
poorly understood. Despite this morbidity and limited treatment options, research on PMDD’s pathophysiology
and treatment lags behind that of other brain disorders. A potential aspect of PMDD’s pathophysiology is altered
interaction between steroid hormones - specifically gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuroactive steroids
(NAS) - and their target, the GABA-A receptor (GABA-A-R). GABAergic NAS, such as the progesterone
metabolite allopregnanolone, fluctuate across the menstrual cycle and are associated with luteal phase symptom
emergence in PMDD. The proposed study will examine three aspects of GABAergic function in PMDD, to
clarify its pathophysiology: 1) GABAergic NAS fluctuations, particularly allopregnanolone (ALLO) and its
isomers, 2) GABA-A-R subunit expression, and 3) GABAergic neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression. A key
focus of this placebo-controlled trial is to assess how these parameters are affected by low-dose SSRI
treatment in women with PMDD, shedding light on treatment mechanism. In this multi-site study, we will assess
288 women with regular menstrual cycles (72 controls, 216 with PMDD), across the luteal phase of the menstrual
cycle. In a second luteal phase, women with PMDD will be randomized to sertraline or placebo. We will capture
three outcome measures: 1) plasma NAS changes within subjects at multiple timepoints across the luteal phase
using precise gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methods, 2) GABA-A-R subunit expression
across the luteal phase in blood cells measured via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and 3)
GABAergic neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression. We will compare controls versus women with PMDD, and
within those with PMDD compare sertraline versus placebo. The study explores a mechanistic hypothesis about
NAS dynamics and GABA-A-R plasticity in women with PMDD, and focuses on biologically relevant treatment
target engagement. The multiple investigators bring complementary expertise; Drs. Hantsoo and Payne in
prospective studies of reproductive affective disorders, and Dr. Pinna in applying state-of-the-art methods to
study the impact of NAS on GABA-A-R function. This study represents a critical step in elucidating NAS and
GABA-A-R dynamics in women with PMDD when treated with low-dose SSRIs, which may shed light on both
pathophysiology and treatment response mechanisms. Understanding PMDD’s pathophysiology may also
inform treatment development, i.e.GABA-modulating drugs that have recently emerged as treatments for
postpartum depression. Assessing parameters affected by SSRI in PMDD could lead to developing a
personalized medicine approach."
10976155,"Project Summary / Abstract
The primary objective of this proposal is to expand on our current R01 project (parent award R01AA029258),
which investigates astrocyte-neuron interaction in the dorsal striatum during ethanol seeking behaviors. Our
laboratory previously demonstrated that heightened astrocyte activity in the Dorsal Medial Striatum (DMS)
contributes to the transition from habitual behaviors to goal-directed behaviors. This discovery suggests a
potential method to reverse maladjusted reward-seeking behavior patters observed in various
psychopathologies, including addition. Within the scope of parent R01 award, our proposal aims to explore
the prelimbic and orbital frontal cortices (PL, OFC). These regions are pivotal in decision making and reward
economics, respectively, providing the majority of glutamatergic input into the DMS. By targeting these areas,
we aim to increase DMS astrocyte activity, and consequently rescue behavior. However, whether increased
activity in these pathways, specifically targeting the DMS, leads to upregulated activity in DMS astrocytes
remains unexplored. Based on our findings, we anticipate that by enhancing cortical-striatal pathway activity,
we can promote the shift from habitual to goal-directed behaviors. In line with the parent award’s focus on
examining astrocyte-neuron interactions in ethanol seeking behaviors, we propose two aims. First (Aim 1),
we will assess if activation of PL or OFC neurons projecting specifically to the DMS leads to increased DMS
astrocyte calcium dynamics and alters ethanol consumption. Next (Aim 2) we will examine cortical neuron
populations projecting specifically to the DMS during reward learning to determine when these regions are
uniquely necessary. Finally, we will once again increase activity from either the PL or OFC to the DMS during
reward devaluation to examine whether upregulated activity facilitates the transition from habitual to goal-
seeking behaviors. To foster development and training for Dr. Mathew Lopez who is eligible for diversity
supplement support, he will receive guidance and support from Dr. Choi. In addition, a mentoring advisory
board comprising esteemed scientist and physician-scientist from the Mayo Clinic will provide structured
career development and scientific advice as detailed in the mentoring plan. Matthew will participate in career
development workshops, present at scientific conferences and local seminars, with an expectation of two
publications per year. This work aims to pave the way for Matthew’s future NIH extramural funding, targeting
K99/R00."

 The applicant, Ms. Mia Campbell, proposes to investigate the complex relationships between
caregiver experiences of racial discrimination, environmental characteristics, and adolescent
depression, addressing a critical need in public health. This dissertation project will ultimately prepare the
applicant for an independent research career focused on improving the prevention and treatment of depression
and mood disorders among adolescents.
 Adolescent depression is a pressing public health concern in the United States with marked disparities by
gender and race. The significance of this research lies in the increasing prevalence of adolescent depression,
especially among racially minoritized groups, and its profound and long-lasting consequences on individuals'
lives. Utilizing a unique dataset from the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcome (ECHO) Program,
we will apply innovative methodologies to unravel these intricate connections. In Aim 1, we will identify latent
classes of caregivers based on their experiences of everyday racial discrimination and explore their
associations with adolescent depression. This study extends the existing body of research by incorporating
caregiver discrimination experiences as a crucial factor in understanding adolescent depression.
 Aims 2 and 3 delve into the moderation effects of psychosocial and environmental factors on the
relationship between caregiver discrimination and adolescent depression. Employing linear mixed models, we
will examine the dynamic interplay of these variables over time. We will also investigate the influence of
multiple psychosocial and environmental factors to explore how they shape the relationship between caregiver
experiences and adolescent depression. By adopting a transdisciplinary approach and collaborating with
experts in latent class analysis, longitudinal methods, and racism scholarship, this research seeks to provide
novel insights into the determinants of adolescent mental health. Our ultimate goal is to develop a
comprehensive framework that integrates social and physical environments, caregiver discrimination, and
adolescent depression. The outcomes of this research will guide targeted interventions and policies to create
healthier and more supportive environments for vulnerable adolescents.
 In summary, this study will contribute to advancing the field of public mental health by bridging existing gaps
in knowledge and practice. It will provide innovative solutions for addressing the mental health needs of
adolescents and help reduce disparities in depression rates, ultimately improving the well-being of the next
generation."
10977761,"Project Summary/Abstract
Striated muscle tissue contains the highest mitochondrial content and the largest known proteins,
which present unique challenges to the translational machinery. Muscle tissue specifically expresses
a paralogous ribosomal protein, RLP3L, that is roughly 80% similar to the ubiquitous RPL3, and is
essential to the formation of the large subunit of the ribosome. In muscle, RPL3L substitutes for RPL3
in the ribosome, but how this alters ribosome function remains unknown. Furthermore, these two
paralogs demonstrate an inverse relationship under conditions of muscle adaptation, stress, and
pathology. In dystrophic muscle, RPL3L is lost in favor of RPL3 in the ribosome, but the effects on
muscle functional decline are not understood. Recent evidence suggests that ribosomes can
specialize in order to selectively translate certain genes into proteins. Additionally, translation control
has emerged as a novel layer of regulation for mitochondrial function, which declines early in the
pathology of muscular dystrophy, prior to an overt phenotype. Taken together, I hypothesize that the
loss of RPL3L in dystrophic muscle impairs ribosome specialization, thus contributing to an imbalance
between mitochondrial and sarcomeric protein synthesis, exacerbating dystrophic disease
progression. Rescue of the muscle specific ribosomal protein in muscular dystrophy will provide the
first evidence for a role of ribosome specialization in muscle functional decline, and help guide the
design of new therapeutics. The proposed studies will also, for the first time, investigate the impact of
glucocorticoids (a common therapy for dystrophy) on muscle ribosome specialization and
translational selectivity. Successful completion of the proposed studies will reveal new therapeutic
targets as well novel mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of chronic debilitating diseases."
10975525,"Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular complications and neuroinflammation, yet the
underlying mechanism of alcohol-induced cerebrovascular damage remains unclear. Recent studies suggest
that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) plays a role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through Rho kinase
signaling. This proposal presents evidence that heavy alcohol consumption (HAC) enhances cerebrovascular
autotaxin levels and decreases lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 (LPP3) expression in brain microvascular
endothelial cells, leading to increased LPA signaling in the cerebrovasculature. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
increase in the cerebrovasculature following HAC, promoting autotaxin expression through the redox-sensitive
transcription factor NFAT and suppressing LPP3 through miR-92a expression. The proposal aims to investigate
the role of autotaxin and LPP3 expression in HAC using cellular, mitochondrial, pharmacological, and molecular
biological approaches. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that the LPA axis critically regulates
mitochondrial redox balance, endothelial activation, and neuroinflammation via aggravating BBB damage in
HAC. The three specific aims include assessing the effect of alcohol on mitochondrial function and redox
balance, evaluating the ability of LPP3 to regulate the alcohol-LPA axis on BBB and neuroinflammation, and
assessing the neuroprotective effect of autotaxin blockade to mitigate the impact of HAC in the
cerebrovasculature. This proposal presents the first evidence that heavy alcohol consumption (HAC) enhances
cerebrovascular LPA signaling, leading to neuroinflammation via aggravating BBB damage, and suggests
autotaxin inhibition as a potential therapy for alcohol-induced cerebrovascular damage and LPA signaling. The
findings of this study could improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying alcohol-induced
cerebrovascular injury and provide a foundation for developing targeted therapies to treat these conditions."

 Approximately 80% of patients with ovarian cancer and 30% of patients with uterine cancer are
diagnosed with advanced disease. In the absence of effective screening, many patients present with severe
functional decline from symptomatic burden from chronic malnutrition due to obstructed bowels,
hypoalbuminemia with ascites, and muscle wasting due to fatigue and physical inactivity. The average age of
diagnosis is 62 years old, however patients present with accelerated physiologic aging because of these
catabolic diseases. Furthermore, as the population continues to age the number of older adults with these
gynecologic cancers will significantly grow. Options for symptomatic relief and potential prolonged survival
require intensive treatment including months of poorly tolerated chemotherapy and morbid abdominal surgery.
The choice of treatment and timing is predominantly age-based and dependent upon subjective assessments
by surgeons, and the balance of over- and under-treatment of prolonging survival against the harms of
aggressive surgery and chemotherapy may be better achieved through objective frailty assessments.
Furthermore, older adults report that quality of life and functional independence are as important as traditional
oncologic measures, yet few researchers have examined these essential patient-centered outcomes.
 The purpose of this study is to 1) objectively assess physical frailty in this patient population and
quantify the associations with perioperative (90-day healthy days at home after surgery) and oncologic adverse
events (relative dose intensity of chemotherapy) and 2) characterize and identify predictors of functional
recovery and quality of life at 3 and 6 months after presentation. To accomplish these aims, we will utilize an
existing research infrastructure of a prospective multi-center cohort (“Promoting gynecologic cancer patients
with frailty to achieve functional recovery cohort” aka “PROOF cohort” NCT06089083). We will perform
repeated functional and quality of life assessments in patients 50 years and older after presentation of
advanced ovarian or uterine cancer on 100 patients.
 This is an innovative prospective study with longitudinal physical frailty and quality of life measures,
including functional recovery, that are not currently available in existing datasets. This proposed project
focuses on an understudied group who are particularly vunlerable as the majority of these women are older
adults with significant symptom burden. The overall goal is to create a rapid, novel physical frailty tool specific
to this paient population that will improve the ability of our field to assess the risks of over- vs under-treatment
and make objective treatment decisions in the use of surgery and chemotherapy that align with outcomes
important to older adults. The GEMSSTAR award is crucial to continuing the important work we have laid the

11041818,"The correct determination of nodal metastatic disease is imperative for patient management in oncology, since the patient’s prognosis and subsequent treatment are inherently linked to the stage of disease. Detection/segmentation of lymph node on imaging is a tedious, highly time-consuming process that is inherently subject to intra-/inter-observer variability. Malignancy classification of the lymph node improves both the diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning. An AI software, OncoAI, was successfully developed in Phase I that automatically detects and segments enlarged lymph nodes from MRI and CT and enables fully automated RECIST measurements. The overall goal of this Phase II proposal is to further enhance the performance of the AI models for lymph node detection, segmentation, and measurements and develop additional AI models for malignancy classification leveraging multi-modality imaging. Software functionality and usability will be further improved towards seamless incorporation within the clinical workflow. Finally, a multi-institutional validation study will be conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of OncoAI in clinical practice and obtain regulatory approval. The proposed aims will set a strong technical and regulatory foundation for OncoAI and contribute to not only commercial success, but also broader impact to the clinical practice of cancer care."
10977458,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) contains a desmoplastic stroma that limits blood perfusion and thus
the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and therapeutics, creating a hypoxic microenvironment that is able to resist
nearly all forms of treatment, including immunomodulating therapy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are
the main components and producers of stroma in PDAC. The hypoxia-inducible factors-1 (HIF1) and -2 (HIF2)
are stabilized in low oxygen and have been hypothesized to mediate therapeutic resistance and aggressive
growth of PDAC, but deletion of HIF1 or HIF2 in the pancreatic epithelial compartment produced no obvious
phenotype in PDAC. Thus, we reasoned that HIF may instead be supporting PDAC pathobiology through its
functions in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the other major cellular component in pancreatic
tumors. Since little was known about the role of HIF in the stromal compartment, we created a mouse model
that exploits two recombinases enabling us complete spatiotemporal control of tumor growth and HIF ablation
in CAFs. Using this model, we found that the abrogation of HIF2 in CAFs decreased tumor growth and doubled
the median survival of animals with pancreatic cancer. The loss of HIF2 in CAFs correlated with fewer
intratumoral M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Furthermore, conditioned media from hypoxic CAFs
produced similar effects in ex vivo assays even after boiling. These preliminary data suggested a HIF2-
dependent crosstalk between CAF and the immune compartment that may be critical to the ability of PDAC to
evade the immune system. Building on this preliminary data, we propose to identify the molecular mechanisms
that allow hypoxic CAFs to modulate the immune microenvironment of pancreatic cancer through three aims.
In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mediators of HIF2-dependent crosstalk between CAFs and
macrophages. We will use mass spectrometry to identify the HIF2 dependent factor secreted from CAFs
capable of inducing M2 polarization in macrophages and determine how this factor is produce in CAFs and
how it alters macrophage function. Aim 2 will define the HIF2-dependent relationships between CAFs and T
lymphocytes. We will explore how CD8+ suppression and Treg conversion is regulated by HIF2 signaling in
CAFs using mouse models and co-culture methods. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will repurpose HIF2 inhibitors from
their current indications in renal cell carcinoma to pancreatic cancer as a drug to enhance immunotherapy
responses. The proposed research is significant because pancreatic cancer does not respond to
immunotherapy, and our data suggests that HIF2 inhibition may greatly improve immune responses. This
research is innovative because we will provide the first description of the immune-targeting molecular
pathways activated by hypoxic microenvironment in PDAC. Further, we will offer the first mechanistic
evaluation of a potential therapeutic combination using a HIF2 inhibitor along with immune checkpoint
blockade as the first steps towards clinical translation."

Disruption of developmental processes, often due to genetic mutation, can lead to structural birth defects
that have life-long consequences for affected individuals and their families. Identification of patient-
specific genetic changes, followed by mechanistic studies, can increase our understanding of how
developmental perturbations lead to defects and offer insight into potential future clinical interventions.
Our long-term goal is to identify molecular and cellular functions of patient-identified, disorder-associated
genes with unknown roles in embryonic development. Here, we focus on one such gene, Mannose-
Binding Lectin-Associated Serine Protease 1 (Masp1), mutations of which are associated with the
developmental disorder 3MC Syndrome. Our objective for this proposal is to identify the underlying
molecular functions of Masp1 in development. We have found that genetic perturbations of Masp1
expression (both overexpression and knockdown) in African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis) embryos
leads to complementary changes in dorsal anterior structures such as altered head size and cement
gland size and shape. Additionally, we found that Masp1 manipulation leads to altered gene expression
patterns suggestive of embryonic patterning defects that could disrupt ectodermal-derived tissues,
possibly through Masp1 intersection with the BMP signaling pathway. In this project, we will continue to
use Xenopus laevis as a model system to address our central hypothesis that Masp1 is involved in
ectoderm patterning through positive regulation of the BMP signaling gradient. First, we will perform
targeted genetic perturbations of Masp1 followed by phenotypic and gene expression analysis to identify
a role of Masp1 proteolytic cleavage in tissue patterning during gastrulation (Aim 1). Next, we will use
both targeted (in vivo luciferase reporter assay) and unbiased (co-immunoprecipitation followed by
LC/MS) approaches to identify Masp1 targets and determine how Masp1 regulates BMP signaling (Aim
2). Through this work, we will provide undergraduate and graduate students with meaningful research
experiences in the field of developmental biology. Upon completion of this study, we expect to determine
the mechanistic basis for Masp1 involvement in early development and identify a new player in regulation
of BMP morphogenic signaling with future implications for interventions of Masp1- and BMP-associated
developmental disorders."

will relapse and die despite chemoradiation treatment. There is an urgent need to identify prognostic and
predictive biomarkers for chemoradiation response. We have developed and optimized a novel, non-invasive
swab-based biopsy approach to collect tissue before, during, and after chemoradiation without patient discomfort
or risks of serial biopsies such as bleeding or fistula. Despite low tumor purity, we have also developed a custom
computational pipeline to optimize mutation calling and identify clonally expanded mutations during
chemoradiation. Developing a deep understanding of genomic alterations during and after CRT to these findings
will help fast-track clinical translation of targeted therapies. To this end, we have used our pipeline in a pilot study
of 70 patients to reconstruct the evolution of mutations during CRT and identify proliferatively advantageous
driver mutations and pathways. This proposal aims to validate the candidate driver mutation lists in multiple
dimensions and develop a patient-derived organoid platform to test potential targeted therapies. First, we will
validate the preliminary identified clonally expanded genes and pathways in a larger population of already
collected but yet-to-be-sequenced samples. Second, we will perform a CRISPR/Cas9 library screen of these
preliminarily identified drivers in available cervical cancer cell lines. Simultaneously, we will develop a cervical
cancer organoid biobank to perform single-cell RNA sequencing before and after CRT and validate these
preliminarily identified genes. This platform will be used in the future to test targeted agents. When we complete
the aims of this R21, we will have validated ideal targets, developed testing platforms, and set the stage for
testing clinically impactful therapies in a future R01."
10977293,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We aim to renew a highly productive collaboration that has developed revolutionary new ultrasound imaging
hardware and processing approaches. Our innovative technologies have enabled high-signal-to-noise and high-
resolution contrast-enhanced microvascular imaging. Specifically, we developed the world’s first ultra-broadband
co-axial dual-frequency linear arrays, which enable transmission of ultrasound at low frequencies and reception
of high-frequency content from microbubbles well beyond their 7th harmonic. These transducers enable
superharmonic imaging, which provides high-resolution contrast images of the microvasculature with essentially
no tissue background and is used for visualizing vessels on the order of 100 microns in both animal and human
tissues. Significantly, we have utilized these tools to image microvascular angiogenesis, known for decades to
be a biomarker of cancer, yet not previously possible to image directly with ultrasound. Our ‘acoustic
angiography’ imaging readily shows drastic differences in microvasculature density and structure between
malignant cancers and healthy tissue, providing superior sensitivity and specificity to early micro-breast tumors
in mice genetically predisposed to breast cancer. Furthermore, our excellent superharmonic signal separation
enables super-resolution imaging without the cumbersome spatiotemporal filtering approaches otherwise used
for this process, which are readily corrupted by tissue motion or slow flow. Our next generation approach will
enable outstanding microvascular resolution (<100 um) in deep tissue (4-8 cm), despite slow microvascular flow,
and with robustness to tissue motion. Despite our advances in hardware and imaging techniques, challenges
remain to make our technology optimal for imaging human cancers. The shallow focal depth of the arrays
designed in the prior project period, limited by prototype array and lens designs, and carried over from their
original small-animal imaging applications, is far from optimized for the 3-4 cm depth needed to image suspicious
breast lesions in humans. In this renewal, we will direct the development and optimization of dual-frequency
arrays specifically for deeper clinical imaging (targeting depths up to 8cm). Our loss in resolution due to lower
frequency bandwidths will be recovered by superharmonic super-resolution processing. We have demonstrated
this approach with excellent results using the prototype dual frequency arrays, enabling recovery of sub-100
micron resolution, even with frequencies that can penetrate 6-8 cm. Furthermore, since microvascular imaging
provides the most diagnostic information when acquired in 3D, we will develop the first dual-frequency 2D arrays.
Successful completion of these aims will advance ultrasound imaging closer to a practical clinical modality for
identifying and assessing angiogenic and molecular biomarkers of cancer with high specificity and sensitivity for
future applications such as differentiation of suspicious lesions, assessment of response to therapy, and early
detection. Combined with the hardware development, we will optimize acoustic parameters, develop
beamforming and imaging strategies, and test performance in preclinical and clinical populations."

A single driver mutation, BRAFV600E, drives half of all melanomas. However, in the majority of cases,
acquisition of BRAFV600E instead drives benign tumors, such as melanocytic nevi (the common mole). We seek
to decipher the intracellular mechanisms that prevent full transformation, and harness this knowledge to
develop candidate early diagnosis and chemoprevention strategies. We have discovered a signature of
microRNAs (miRNA) as the most differentially expressed transcripts distinguishing nevi from either normal
melanocytes or melanomas. We have reported that expression of these miRNAs classifies biopsied pigmented
neoplasms with high diagnostic accuracy. To determine whether knowledge of these miRNAs could aid in the
prevention of melanoma: First, we conducted a comprehensive identification and functional screen of the
targets of the most predictive miRNA, MIR211-5p. Using freshly isolated and CRISPR engineered human
normal, nevus and melanoma melanocytes, we identified inhibition of AURKB expression as a critical
mechanism driving both BRAFV600E and MIR211-5p associated growth arrest in vitro. Therefore, in Aim 1, our
objective is to assess the roll of the MIR211-5p/AURKB axis in nevus formation and transformation in vivo, and
the efficacy of disrupting this axis in melanoma chemoprevention. Second, we generated a non-invasive assay
for miRNA screening of pigmented lesions prior to biopsy. In a small pilot study, we found the high accuracy of
classification of melanocytic neoplasia was retained. In Aim 2, our objective is to validate the utility of using
non-invasive profiling of the miRNA signature to screen pigmented skin lesions.
Three advances distinguish our proposal. The first is the reproducibility of our miRNA classifier, currently
validated on six independent datasets. Second, our model systems for this disease—engineered primary
human melanocytes, nevi, and melanomas, combined with an in vivo system that recapitulates both the
genetics and progression of melanoma—puts us in a unique position to control for context-specific effects
when studying these critical events. Third, is our development of a non-invasive miRNA profiling assay, a
molecular profiling technique that is both non-invasive and lesion-specific. Our team, consisting of experts in
both the basic biology of miRNA and melanoma, in vivo models of melanoma, topical drug delivery, and the
daily practice of melanoma surveillance, allows us to comprehensively tackle this project.
This project has both basic and clinical potential significance. Our studies explore novel explanations for nevus
initiation, driven by observations made from clinical lesions. We expect these studies to directly result in an
increase in the early detection of melanomas and preclinical validation of a strategy for topical
chemoprevention for particularly high-risk individuals and/oror anatomic areas."
10977296,"DNA damage, particularly DNA double strand break (DSB), has detrimental effects on cell survival and
genomic stability. In response to DNA damage, the cell activates several evolutionarily-conserved
mechanisms to repair DNA damage, halt cell proliferation, or induce cell death. These surveillance
mechanisms, collectively defined as the DNA damage response (DDR), constitute an important etiological
factor for many human diseases, especially cancer. Moreover, the DDR is a key determinant for the
therapeutic outcome of cancer treatment using radiation and other DNA damaging agents. A long-term
goal of our laboratory is to delineate new DDR factors and mechanisms using comprehensive
experimental tools, and thereby, revealing new insights into cancer progression and treatment. In a recent
effort to systematically identify new components of the DSB “repairosome”, we identified Kif2C and several
other MT regulators as potential DSB-associated proteins. Kif2C is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites
and plays an essential role in DSB repair. Strikingly, Kif2C mediates the spatial movement of DSBs, and
controls DNA damage-induced chromatin remodeling. These functions of Kif2C are largely dependent on
its MT depolymerase activity, and are likely to be achieved via coordination with other MT regulators. On
the other hand, DNA damage modulates Kif2C phosphorylation and MT stabilization. These findings
suggest a novel inter-organelle crosstalk between MT components and the DDR machinery that differs
from the conventional perception that MT functions exclusively as a cytoplasmic structure. These findings
also reveal new mechanistic insights into the clinical combinations of DNA damaging agents with anti-MT
poisons in cancer therapy. In this project, we will further reveal detailed mechanisms via which Kif2C
modulates the mobility of DSBs; we will uncover how Kif2C acts in concert with chromatin remodelers and
other MT regulators to govern the dynamic chromatin compaction at damage chromatin; we will
functionally characterize ATM-mediated Kif2C phosphorylation, and regulation of MT stabilization after
DNA damage. Together, the project will potentially provide paradigm shifting additions to both the DDR
and MT biology, and improve our understanding of how the cell coordinates various cellular components
and mechanisms to maintain genomic stability and cell homeostasis after DNA damage."
10977303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The breast lobules are the structures that produce milk in lactating women, and are also the primary
site of origin for breast cancer. Age-related lobular involution (LI) is a physiological process in which the
epithelial tissue of the breast lobules gradually regresses with age, corresponding with elimination of the need
for milk production beyond the child-bearing years. Analysis of our cohort of more than 14,000 women with
benign breast disease (BBD) revealed that LI is strongly associated with reduced risk of subsequent breast
cancer, and thus LI constitutes a natural mechanism for prevention of breast cancer. However, more than 40%
of postmenopausal women with BBD have not completed LI, and these women are at substantially greater risk
of developing breast cancer compared to women of similar age whose involution process has completed. In
this application, we propose experiments to identify critical effectors of LI and to determine how these can be
used to improve breast cancer risk assessment for women who have not undergone LI. In Aim 1, we will define
the mediators that underlie the link between delayed LI and a high risk cellular phenotype. We will use a newly-
generated panel of very early passage primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) derived from women
with BBD and varying degrees of LI, in combination with humanized mouse xenograft models in which the LI
status of the HMECs is manifest. In Aim 2, we will identify mediators associated with ongoing vs delayed LI in a
newly-defined clinical cohort of peri- and post-menopausal women for whom multiple, sequential benign
biopsies are available. In Aim 3, biomarkers discovered in Aims 1 and 2 (plus other promising biomarkers) will
be evaluated for association with subsequent breast cancer in a patient cohort of postmenopausal women.
The cohorts interrogated in Aims 2 and 3 will be drawn both from the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort, which is
primarily composed of White/Caucasian women, and the Detroit BBD cohort, which is composed of
Black/African-American women, which will allow us to evaluate race as a biological variable in our analyses. By
providing insight into the processes that control LI and by developing tractable experimental models in which to
evaluate the effects of modulating those processes, our work will provide a better understanding of LI delay
and its link to breast cancer and will point toward methods for inducing LI in women for whom this process is
stalled or delayed, as a physiologically-derived method for breast cancer prevention."
10977401,"Abstract/Summary
Chemotherapy and radiation can induce breast tumors to enter a prolonged state of growth arrest with
characteristics of senescence. A senescent-like state is also characteristic of residual tumor cells that survive
after chemotherapy and/or radiation have eliminated the bulk of a tumor cell population. Tumor cells surviving
therapy-induced senescence have the capacity to recover proliferative capacity subsequent to their prolonged
growth arrest. Recovery and re-emergence of tumor cells from this growth-arrested state could contribute to
disease recurrence months or years after the patient has apparently been cured of the primary disease.
 Several agents have recently been identified as having senolytic properties [e.g. ABT-263 (navitoclax)]
which can selectively kill senescent cells. Given that disease recurrence and consequent cancer mortality is
frequently associated with the re-emergence of proliferative tumor cells either at the primary disease site or
metastatic sites, a primary goal of this project will be to test the hypothesis that senolytic agents can eliminate
therapy induced senescent breast tumor cells to prevent, or at least significantly suppress, cancer recurrence.
 Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that the senolytic agent, ABT-263, can efficiently eliminate cells
induced into senescence by chemotherapy or radiation when used sequentially (and potentially, repeatedly) after
the initial therapy. Sensitivity to senolytics will be assessed in senescence-sorted breast tumor cells, prior to
senescence and during the course of recovery, and in residual populations surviving after the bulk of the tumor
population has been eliminated by therapeutic agents. The effectiveness of a sequential treatment schedule will
also be assessed in vivo using xenograft and PDX tumor models.
 Aim 2 will interrogate the mechanisms whereby the senolytic ABT-263 promotes cell death in senescent
breast tumor cells, with a focus on the contributions of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins.
 Aim 3 will examine the immune response to therapy-induced senescent cells alone and after treatment
with senolytics. A phenotypic assessment of tumor infiltrating immune cells and studies with selective immune
cell depletion in mouse models will define the nature (adaptive and innate) of the antitumor immune response.
Ex vivo studies will further determine NK- and T cell-mediated lysis of senescent cells in the absence or presence
of ABT-263. The ability of senolytics to induce immunogenic cell death will be a focus. Toxicity to the host will
be compared for exposure to senolytics concomitant with chemotherapy (i.e. prior to entry into senescence) and
subsequent to induction of senescence."
10977403,"With advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer, are more likely to
die from non-AIDS-related causes, and are less likely to die from AIDS-related complications. In fact, lung cancer
is now the leading cause of cancer death among PLWH. Tobacco use is a major contributing factor to lung
cancer incidence and mortality among PLWH since smoking rates among PLWH are approximately 40-50%.
Indeed, this is more than double or triple the 15.5% rate of smoking in the general United States population. With
several evidence-based tobacco treatment approaches at the patients' disposal, including pharmacotherapy and
behavioral counseling, optimizing how those treatments are delivered to patients requires an empirical approach.
Routine clinical care through the healthcare system may not be optimized to reach this patient population. Prior
research has shown that proactive tobacco treatment increases the likelihood of treatment engagement and
downstream cessation. Beyond the method for engaging in the initial contact session, prior studies have
demonstrated that there are optimal ways for framing how the tobacco treatment is being provided. That is,
presenting smoking cessation in an opt-out fashion results in increased patient reach and likelihood of
abstinence. Despite the evidence in support of a proactive, opt-out method for smoking cessation intervention
delivery, this strategy has not been evaluated in the context of tobacco treatment for PLWH. Further, because
this approach can connect patients with available, evidence-based interventions that can be delivered remotely,
it holds promise for implementation in the context of healthcare settings across the country. In the proposed
study, we will conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the impact of a proactive,
opt-out smoking cessation intervention on smoking cessation outcomes and advance understanding of key
barriers and facilitators of implementation processes. We propose a comparison of Treatment As Usual [TAU;
reactive, opt-in smoking cessation treatment delivered through Infectious Diseases clinical pathways] to
Proactive Outreach with Medication Opt-out for Tobacco Treatment Engagement (PrOMOTE) and
characterization of key determinants of PrOMOTE implementation outcomes. The intervention will consist of a
tobacco treatment specialist proactively and remotely contacting a patient to assess smoking status, provide a
brief motivational interview and counseling, and provide a mail-order prescription for varenicline (or dual NRT if
indicated) in an opt-out fashion. This proposed study will examine this novel approach to optimizing delivery of
smoking cessation care for PLWH. Integrating effectiveness and implementation results will help define best
practices for engaging PLWH with existing evidence-based smoking cessation interventions. This hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial presents on opportunity to optimize tobacco treatment delivery, and identify
barriers and facilitators towards future implementation and dissemination to ambulatory HIV clinics across the
country."
10977405,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As a ubiquitous HSP90 paralog in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GRP94 plays important roles in protein quality
control in the secretory pathway by participating in both the unfolded protein response and the ER-associated
protein degradation pathway. My laboratory has demonstrated that GRP94 is a strategically important target for
cancer, because it controls multiple key molecular pathways in cell growth, migration, immune tolerance and
differentiation, including integrins, TLRs, IGF-II, Wnt co-receptor LRP6, and GARP (or LRRC32). GARP
(Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant) is responsible for surface docking and activation of latent TGFb and
a focus of this proposal We have made significant contributions to this area through immunological and
biochemical studies, including: 1) that GARP is an important molecule for cancer immune evasion via regulating
multiple cell types (e.g., cancer cells, platelets, regulatory T cells, B cells). 2) We discovered a novel mechanism
of TGFb activation from cell surface GARP-TGFb complex via proteolytic cleavage of GARP. 3) GARP has been
found to be aberrantly expressed in multiple human cancers to promote oncogenesis via both cancer cell-intrinsic
and -extrinsic mechanisms. 4) Preclinical studies suggest that GARP is a novel therapeutic target for cancer
immunotherapy. These accomplishments have deepened our conviction that the study of GRP94 and its client
network will lead to better understanding of this chaperone biology in cancer and to development of novel cancer
therapeutics, alone or in combination with approved immunotherapeutic agents. In the next phase of the study,
we will address the hypothesis that GRP94/GARP-targeted therapy applied to multiple vulnerable cancers will
overcome immune resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
First, we will determine the roles and molecular mechanism involved in GRP94 regulation of TGFb biogenesis,
activation and signaling. This aim will focus on structural analysis of the GRP94-GARP complex, and on resolving
mechanisms of GRP94 in folding two other molecules important in regulating TGFb signaling: LRRC33 and
LRG1. Second, we will develop novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies targeting GRP94 and GARP. The
goal is to advance the top first-in-class agent(s) among several pre-clinical leads through a milestone-driven
strategy. This includes agents to inhibit GARP cleavage, GARP-specific antibodies, drug-like GRP94-selective
inhibitors, antibodies against the cell surface GRP94 (ectoGRP94) preferentially expressed on cancer cells, and
T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) composed of a single-chain antibody against
ectoGRP94 fused with T cell signaling motifs (GRP94-CAR-T). Overall, the impact of this study lies in
fundamental understanding of GRP94 in regulating the TGFb pathway and in developing promising next
generation immunotherapeutic agents."
10977526,"Abstract
Combining cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors with endocrine therapy improves outcomes for metastatic
estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2 negative, breast cancer patients. However, the value of this combination
in potentially curable earlier stage patients is variable. Our preliminary results examined the evolutionary
trajectories of early stage breast cancer tumors using single cell transcriptomic profiling of serial tumor biopsies
from a clinical trial of preoperative endocrine therapy alone (letrozole) or in combination with the cell cycle
inhibitor ribociclib. Resistant tumors with accelerated loss of estrogen signaling show up-regulation of the JNK
pathway, while those that maintain estrogen signaling during therapy show potentiation of CDK4/6 activation
consistent with ERBB4 and ERK signaling up-regulation. Cell cycle reconstruction identified that tumors cells
can reactivate during combination treatment, indicating stronger selection for a proliferative state. We
hypothesize that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in earlier stage breast cancer is driven by JNK MAPK
pathway stimulation and reactivation of the cell cycle through promotion of CDK6 expression or
decreased cell cycle inhibitor function. In Aim 1, we will use a new mechanistic model of CDK4/6 regulation
by cell cycle Inhibitors and Promoters (CIP) that couples estrogen and JNK signaling with cell cycle progression
to measure the mechanisms driving cell cycle activation in a series of isogenic cell lines sensitive and resistant
to CDK4/6 and endocrine inhibitors and in patient tumor cells. This analysis will reveal how distinct signaling
pathways contribute to cell cycle reactivation during estrogen, CDK4/6 and JNK inhibition treatments and provide
signatures of each resistant mechanism across cell types, over time and between systems. Aim 2 leverages our
collection of patient tumors from the FELINE clinical trial to discover the intracellular and intratumoral resistance
mechanisms driving proliferation. Fundamental resistance mechanisms will be measured in over ~300,000
patient cells from 360 tumor samples using single cell RNA sequencing data already in hand to identify core
intracellular signaling states that act alone or in concert to drive proliferation. Next, the population of cells within
each tumor will be analyzed to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity and how resistant populations differ in growing
or shrinking tumors during drug treatment. Applying CIP to project proliferation across patient tumor cells will
allow prediction of inhibitor strategies that most effectively block intracellular and intratumoral proliferation. Lastly,
Aim 3 will apply a series of JNK pathway drugs with clinical potential to design and test treatment strategies that
maintain durable inhibition of proliferation in ER+ cancer cells. Iterative feedback between mathematical models
and patient/experimental data serves to provide a deep understanding of cell cycle regulation and mechanisms
of dysregulation leading to resistance. Together, these experiments will reveal the balance between estrogen
and alternative mediated JNK signaling, and their roles in resistance and provide a guide for therapeutic regimes
with more durable control of cancer cell proliferation."

Different patients with Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) can harbor mutations that result in constitutively
activated versions of tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR, RET, ALK, ROS1, TRK) that can be precisely targeted with
inhibitors. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are vulnerable to existing, known and unknown, drug resistance
mechanisms found in tumors. This results in a game of molecular “whack-a-mole” whereby, resistance evolution
appears, the mechanism is isolated, drugs are administered to combat that drug resistance, and then resistance
re-emerges until no effective therapies remain. This process of reverse engineering drug resistance has been a
losing battle with a high cost for patients. A promising approach to combat the challenge of resistance evolution
is to design and test cell therapies that can sense the therapeutic environment and respond through synthetic
biology circuits to reproducibly control evolutionary trajectories. We propose a synthetic biological technology
with proof-of-concept function in mammalian cells that we term “dual-switch selection drives”. These drives use
inducible drug resistance to create a cell therapy that can engineer a tumor’s evolution in situ. The first switch
senses the presence of a dimerizer molecule to create reversible drug resistance. Using the mathematical rules
of biophysics and evolution, our cell therapy calculates a response to small molecules and produces a tunable
amount of cellular fitness that competes with pre-existing drug resistance variants in a tumor. A second switch
with a suicide gene payload hitchhikes on this evolution guided cell therapy until the selection drive cells comprise
the majority of the tumor. Then, at the flip of a second switch, a locally diffusible toxin is produced that kills all
cells--gene drive or pre-existing resistance mutants of any molecular origin--through a bystander effect. This
technology works with the existing standard of care drugs in NSCLC to produce localized combination therapy
that can eradicate pre-existing resistance regardless of the molecular mechanism. Therefore, instead of
responding to and combatting evolution, we use forward engineering of cell therapies to direct evolution. In Aim
1 we will use nonintuitive insights from stochastic models of the evolutionary stability of our designs to propose
further optimized selection drives. Aim 2 expands our forward engineering approach by pushing our model driven
design of safety and efficacy towards the spatial, cellular, and microenvironmental heterogeneity present in
NSCLC. Aim 3 proposes to move evolutionary proof-of-concept experiments into primary human organoids from
NSCLC patients with activating mutations in EGFR. Beyond practical testing of a technology, we will also “build
to understand” the basic cancer biology of resistance evolution."

10976951,"Millions of individuals and loved ones are impacted by opioid and other substance use disorders (SUD) and tragic overdoses each year. Yet, as researchers and other health professionals’ quest for empirically supported practices surges, the voices of prospective patients and loved ones are unheard, particularly among those with criminal legal system (CLS) engagement. The Dissemination and Stakeholder Engagement Core (DSEC) extends beyond researcher-practitioner partnerships to include the partnership of patients and loved ones in the development, dissemination, and implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment services for opioid use disorder (OUD), SUD, and overdose risk behaviors. Recognizing that uptake of effective practices requires not only researcher-practitioner buy-in and engagement but also patient receptivity and uptake, DSEC proposes four aims. Aim 1: Stakeholder engagement with network leadership. To achieve this aim, DSEC will enhance the work of JCOIN 1.0 by establishing a Lived Experience Board of individuals in addition to adding membership to the currently established Practitioner and Stakeholder Boards. Aim 2: Outreach and training for stakeholders. Maximizing the findings from JCOIN 1.0, DSEC will deploy six webinars annually to translate findings of JCOIN 1.0; develop two new courses annually on emerging topics and evidence; and present monthly dashboard reports to stakeholders. Aim 3: Rapid translation of research findings for stakeholder audiences. Aim 3 will be achieved by DSEC developing 12 summaries per year of JCOIN 1.0 and JCOIN 2.0 research findings; three video explainers of the evidence per year; one comprehensive toolkit per year; six fact sheets or issue briefs per year; and numerous dissemination products suitable for newsletters and external stakeholder networks. Aim 4: Identifying and engaging potential sites for future JCOIN activities. DSEC serves as a central resource for the growing network of champions by engaging stakeholders to incorporate concerns and values into the JCOIN processes and will identify sites and partnerships for future JCOIN research. DSEC will accomplish this through marketing efforts and JCOIN’s CONNECT discovery tool, which was developed in JCOIN 1.0 to support researcher-practitioner collaborations. Learning from the feedback of JCOIN 1.0, the proposed JCOIN 2.0 extends DSEC approaches to linking the Lived Experience, Stakeholder, and Practitioner Boards with NIDA leadership and HEAL researchers; partnering with the TA Core to extend outreach to marginalized communities so that those communities and individuals can gain access to scientific discoveries and essential resources such as geospatial tools; increasing stakeholder and patient engagement in the co- production of dissemination materials; and working with the Admin and I-Trans Cores to speed and spread adoption of evidenced-informed policies and interventions. DSEC work will be guided by an Integrated Community Engagement Framework (ICEF) and represents a connection to the vast stakeholders which links researchers to constituents to add value to research, analyses, translation, dissemination, and implementation. This project is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."

Lung diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and other Chronic Lung Diseases (CLDs) are among the most prevalent of these
lung diseases worldwide and their prevalence is increasing emphasizing the dire need to develop novel therapies
to alleviate the heavy burden of these diseases on the medical care system and to provide better quality of life
for this increasing patient population. The Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMap3) proposes
research teams to expand our growing knowledge of the human lung with specific interest in better defining the
spatial, molecular, and cellular changes that occur in human respiratory diseases. For Phase 3 funding, we
propose to focus on three emerging concepts and challenges: 1) catalogue the phenotypes of adult human lung
diseases at the spatial and single cell level with a focus on COPD, CLDs and more rare diseases that we have
access to via our Human Lung Tissue Bank including alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (A1AT), 2) identify molecular
defects present in the progenitor cell populations of human CLDs through dynamic integration of single cell
analytics with spatial resolution technologies to elucidate disease progression signatures, and 3) develop and
implement new ex vivo and in vivo platforms to mechanistically define the molecular and cellular defects that
occur during the progression of CLDs. This will require the use of advanced transcriptomic, epigenomic, and
bioinformatic approaches to phenotyping cell-cell communication and cell-niche interactions. The Penn
LungMAP Research Center Team has an existing pipeline to acquire normal and diseased lung tissue, and we
have developed extensive bioinformatic software to interrogate changes in cell fates and states in disease from
deep spatial and single cell analysis. The Penn LungMAP Research Center has been extremely productive
during LungMAP Phase 2 support, defining novel cell lineages present in the human lung, characterizing aspects
of emphysematous disease pathology including COPD, and we have begun to define rare CLDs such as A1AT
at a single cell level in addition to providing high quality single cell data from pediatric and adult healthy lung
samples for the LungMap DCC web based platform and the lung research community at large. The strategy of
the Penn LungMAP 3 Research Center is to phenotype the cellular and molecular changes that occur in CLDs
at the single cell level and identify the mechanisms that drive disease progression using novel approaches to
integrate progenitor cell niche regulation using carefully validated ex vivo model systems."
10976952,"Overdose deaths occur at an alarming pace, particularly among those with criminal legal system (CLS)
involvement, and public health professionals continue to seek solutions to reverse this trend. Although empirically
supported prevention and treatment interventions for overdose and substance use disorders exist, and a rapidly
emerging evidence-based innovations became possible through JCOIN, tools for diffusing evidence-based
programs, policies, and practices beyond small-scale efforts are nascent. There is an urgent need for applied
models to support large-scale spread and scale-up of evidence-based innovations (EBIs) within criminal
legal/public health systems that can bridge knowledge translation between researchers and practitioners and
move beyond small-scale adoption of innovations. The Implementation & Translation Research Project (I-
Trans) Core will fill this need by creating and testing a model for EBI spread and scale-up for CLS agencies and
populations to promote the dissemination and implementation of life-changing strategies. The Implementation
Translation Spread and Scale-up Model (I-TranSS Model) will integrate conceptual underpinnings from several
other models, including the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; Diffusion of Innovation
Theory; and Knowledge Translation Complexity Network Model. Building on the experiences in JCOIN 1.0, the
team will pursue three new aims in JCOIN 2.0. Aim 1: Develop an implementation knowledge translation model
(I-TranSS Model). A key element of the Model is a Translation Spread and Scale-up Matrix, which will be
developed by the I-Trans Core, and designed for researchers and practitioners to use to select effective
dissemination and implementation strategies that will be applied based on inner and outer contextual factors.
JCOIN 1.0 researchers and HEAL researchers in CLS-related studies, research participants in JCOIN 1.0
studies, and other implementation experts will be key to the development of the I-TranSS Model. Aim 2: Generate
evidence about effective approaches to translate findings into practice while emphasizing conducting exploratory
research on elements of the I-TranSS Model. The I-Trans Core will use the Coaching Extender Platform
developed in JCOIN 1.0 and the dissemination and implementation of planned and emergent topics as a learning
lab to test key aspects of the I-TranSS Model, including the Translation and Scale-up Matrix. Aim 3: Implement
a methods component to document spread and scale-up using quantitative and qualitative methods and identify
measures suitable to foster knowledge of effective techniques. This activity will result in an inventory of
measurements and/or methods that researchers and practitioners can use to provide feedback on spread and
scale-up activities. The I-TranSS Model will be used to frame the design of future implementation research
projects. The I-Trans Core will provide opportunities for the participants of the Research Education Core (REC)
to gain experience conducting implementation research. JCOIN 1.0 and 2.0 will present opportunities to learn
about the most effective dissemination and implementation spread and scale-up efforts in JCOIN-related studies."
10975263,"In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), danger signals including dead neurons, dystrophic axons, tau and Ab alter the
functional phenotype of microglia from a homeostatic (M0) to a neurodegenerative (MGnD) or DAM (disease
associated microglia) phenotype, which in turn drives neuroinflammation and promotes disease. In addition, it is
now known that there is a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA) in AD which appear at early disease
stages and increase in abundance with disease progression. However, the investigation of microglia and
astrocytes in AD has been hampered by the lack of understanding their phenotype and function and the lack of
therapeutic approaches that can target neuroinflammation associated with these cells. In the mouse model of
chronic EAE, we have found that nasally administered anti-CD3 mAb localizes to cervical lymph nodes where it
induces IL-10-secreting regulatory T cells (Tregs) that then migrate to the brain and suppress both microglia and
astrocyte neuroinflammation. We have recently shown that nasal anti-CD3 improved cognitive deficits in the
3xTg mouse model of AD, an effect independent of amyloid beta deposition, but that was associated with
modulation of the microglia phenotype from a MGnD to a M0 gene signature. We have obtained preliminary data
in which we found close contact between T cells and microglia in the brains of 3xTg mice treated nasally with
anti-CD3 indicating that nasally induced T cells migrate to site of disease in the brain. We hypothesize that
induction of Tregs by nasal anti-CD3 will ameliorate disease in the 3xTg AD model by modulating disease
associated microglia and astrocytes. Our specific aims are:
 Aim 1. Investigation of nasal anti-CD3 modulation of microglia and astrocytes in the 3xTg model
of AD. We will perform pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to determine the biodistribution as well as optimal dose
and regimen of nasal anti-CD3 that modulates microglia and astrocytes. Moreover, mice will be treated with
nasal anti-CD3 at different regimens of administration and will undergo behavioral testing. We will 1) quantify Ab
and tau levels in the brain; 2) characterize microglia and astrocytes using high throughput RNA sequencing; 3)
perform histopathology analysis to measure markers of M0 and MGnD microglia and disease associated
astrocytes; 4) investigate microglia function in vivo by measuring phagocytic ability in clearing dead neurons.
 Aim 2. Investigation of Treg modulation of microglia and astrocytes in the 3xTg model of AD. We
will perform fate mapping studies using Foxp3-eGFPCre/ETR2:3xTg-ROSA26Td-TomatoFlox to track Treg cells in
the brains of these mice and to determine how long IL-10-secreting Tregs remain active in the brain following
nasal anti-CD3 administration. In addition, we will use 3xTg:IL-10Rflox/floxClec7aCreETR2 and 3xTg:IL-
10Rflox/floxGFAPCreETR2 conditional and tamoxifen-induced knockout mice to investigate the role of IL-10 produced
by nasal anti-CD3-induced Tregs in modulating microglia and astrocytes. Furthermore, we will use MERFISH to
define the spatial location of T cells, microglia and astrocyte subsets and their interactions in 3xTg mice."

Overdose is preventable with empirically supported interventions. Yet, effective adoption of scientific discoveries into practice remains a formidable challenge for public health efforts and one of the largest barriers to significantly reducing the prevalence of substance use disorders (SUD), overdoses, and related deaths – particularly among criminal legal system (CLS)-involved individuals. The proposed Research Education Core (REC) team recognizes that training emerging researchers – including early career academic scholars, research-oriented practitioners, and field-based advocates - has substantial potential to overcome research translation problems. The REC program Learning Experiences to Advance Practice (LEAP) builds on the team’s success leading REC in JCOIN 1.0. The REC leadership team has three aims. Aim 1: Provide research education and skill-building to enhance the knowledge and skills of all JCOIN members and other interested parties to conduct research with criminal legal/health agencies, their staff, and involved persons using curated content created by research experts via eLearning courses, short training experiences, and a podcast series through the LEAP Learner program. Aim 2: Create and deliver innovative training, mentorship, and support for a diverse and interdisciplinary cohort of 40 talented early career researchers (LEAP Investigators) and 40 research-interested and/or involved practitioners (LEAP Scholars) to enhance research competencies, facilitate networking connections with JCOIN researchers, and enhance career trajectories. Aim 3: Formulate and coordinate a LEAP Advisory Board that includes people with lived experience (PWLE). The proposed innovations for JCOIN 2.0 respond to the RFA and include six topically focused training packages with short introductory modules and Quick Learning Bursts (QLB) on each topic; JCOIN Grand Round Style lectures; and two new seasons per year (total of 10) of the widely followed Aced It podcast “Turning Science into Sense.” In JCOIN 2.0, LEAP Scholar training will differ from JCOIN 1.0 training in that there will be a deeper focus on implementation science and increased opportunities to engage through the Implementation and Translation Research Projects (I-Trans) Core and/or other JCOIN 2.0-related opportunities. LEAP Scholars and Investigators will be mentored through experiential projects using implementation frameworks like Re-Aim or EPIS. In JCOIN 2.0, the team proposes that mentoring and alumni opportunities will be made available indefinitely. Similarly, the networking and experiential project activities will be enhanced. LEAP participants will receive detailed training in the responsible conduct of research. The diverse REC advisory board, consisting of JCOIN 2.0 members and PWLE working in or supervised by the CLS and/or health systems, will provide expertise, curricular review, and learning opportunity dissemination. This project is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."
10839963,"SUMMARY
Somatic hypermutation (SHM) generates point mutations in immunoglobulin (lg) genes and is vital for the
generation of high affinity antibodies, vaccine efficacy, and protection against infection. The reaction is
initiated when the activation induced deaminase (AID) deaminates cytidines in single-stranded DNA in the
context of transcription by RNA polymerase 2 (Pol2). Mis-targeting of SHM contributes to genetic instability
and the development of a range of B cell malignancies. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that
regulate and target AID/SHM is one of the most important objectives in the study of humoral immunity and is
the central goal of research under this grant Our recent studies have yielded a new conceptual
framework for SHM targeting in which genome looping processes bring SHM targeting (""DIVAC"") elements
with their bound transcription factors (TFs) to the target locus where they stall Pol2, thereby enabling AID
action. Further, our preliminary work has yielded major methodological advances that allow us to overcome
obstacles that have stymied progress in the field. In this proposal, we take advantage of these conceptual
and technical advances to pursue our central goal through the following two aims:
Aim 1: Gene Discovery-Identify new factors involved in SHM and that bind DIVAC elements in vivo.
Few factors involved in SHM targeting are known and no SHM CRISPR/Cas9 screens have been reported.
Furthermore, the TFs that bind DIVAC in vivo to mediate SHM are unknown. We will use novel Rapid Assay
for SHM (RASH) cell lines to perform CRISPR knockout and activation screens to identify SHM factors, and
in vivo proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics to identify factors that associate with active DIVAC
elements. Factors identified will be validated in multiple human cell line models and in mice.
Aim 2: Hypothesis Testing and Mechanism-Determine the contribution and mechanism of action of
chromatin architecture factors, TFs, and TF activation domains in SHM. It has not previously been
possible to assess the role of cell essential factors in SHM. By combining our new Precision Assessment of AID Targeting (PAAT) assay with degron technology, we will rigorously test the role of chromatin architectural
proteins, major B cell TFs, and factors identified in Aim 1 for their role in SHM across the entire genome.
Mechanism of action will be assessed through genome wide assays that assess parameters of transcription,
epigenetic marks, factor binding, and chromatin looping. Genome ""AID activity maps"" will reveal the
contribution of each factor to AID/SHM targeting at lg and non-lg loci. Finally, we take advantage of a novel
SHM reconstitution system to test the hypothesis that DIVAC-bound TFs target SHM using intrinsically
disordered activation domains to create a phase-separated condensate.
Together, our proposed studies are significant for the development of new technologies and for
understanding mechanisms of antibody gene diversification and causes of genome instability and cancer."
10895404,"The long-term objective of this proposal is to integrate the design of experiments and computational
large-scale parameter estimation to advance the understanding of a central problem in neuroscience: How
and whether the subcellular localization of ion channels in dendritic compartments contributes to single
neuron computation. This problem can only be addressed using neurons whose biophysical properties are
well characterized and whose role in the processing of sensory information and the generation of behavior
is well understood. The focus will be on three channel types that play a key role in synaptic integration:
hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated, mixed sodium/potassium channels, transient dendritic
potassium channels, and calcium channels involved in the generation of burst firing. The specific aims will
focus (i) on determining how these channels, in particular calcium channels, contribute to the dendritic
excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells; and (ii) on determining how the same channels contribute to
visual object segmentation in collision detecting neurons. Additionally, the project will (iii) develop a
broader, integrated large-scale modeling optimization framework to study the impact of channel localization
on dendritic computation. The application of this framework in the two systems studied will allow (iv) to
compare channel distributions obtained by model optimization to experimentally derived ones, thus
shedding light on their role in neuronal information processing. A final specific aim will be (v) to disseminate
the newly developed optimization methods to a broader audience allowing the wide application of state-ofthe-
art mathematical knowledge in neuroscience research. The project will apply advanced mathematical
methods centered on second-order optimization algorithms based on multiple-shooting or a collocation
discretization of the dynamical system associated with the modeled neurons. The project will also use
electrophysiological, and immunostaining anatomical techniques to determine subcellular channel
localization experimentally. Overall, the project will contribute to advance the fundamental knowledge on
how subcellular channel localization contributes to the processing of information within individual neurons."
10974817,"The impact of maternal cyanotoxin ingestion on the development and function of the stress axis in
offspring. Anthropogenic activities and global warming have increased water eutrophication, which caused a
significant increase in the frequency in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in freshwaters. This dramatically
elevated the production and release of hazardous cyanotoxins, mainly microcystins (MCs), of which MC leucine
arginine (MC-LR) is the most abundant and toxic form. Accidental, and sub-chronic exposure to environmental
levels of MCs is almost inevitable, through ingestion, inhalation, and/or dermal contact with MC-contaminated
drinking water. Evidence indicate that MCs disrupt the mammalian stress response, which in mammals is under
the control of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Stressors activate hypothalamic paraventricular
nucleus (PVN) neurons to release the neurohormone corticotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates
adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary to activate release of glucocorticoids from the adrenals.
We and others showed that disrupted HPA activity to be linked to promoting anxiety and depression. Our studies
in male mice found that sub-chronic ingestion of non-lethal MC-LR levels caused maladaptive HPA activation
that may lead to stress-related mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. We also found that
peripheral correlates of HPA function, such as metabolic activity and microbiome were MC-LR sensitive.
Together these data formed the premise that sub-chronic ingestion of non-lethal MC-LR levels causes significant
changes in HPA activation in mice. Unlike studies focused on adult animals, prenatal sub-chronic MC-LR effects
on the HPA development and function in the offspring have not been studied in detail. In this proposal, we will
test the hypothesis that sub-chronic maternal ingestion of non-lethal MC-LR levels disrupts embryonic HPA
development and HPA functions in the adult offspring. Aim 1 will determine that sub-chronic maternal ingestion
of non-lethal MC-LR levels disrupts the development of brain regions that control stress axis in embryos, while
aim 2 will determine that sub-chronic maternal ingestion of non-lethal MC-LR levels disrupts HPA functions in
the adult offspring. This proposal will determine the impact of maternal ingestion of MC-LR on HPA development
and function in the offspring. This allows for the evaluation of how in utero cHAB toxins in freshwater sources
affect the homeostasis and health of the offspring, which is of clinical significance given that it is well-established
that disrupted HPA function underlies anxiety and depression."
10975774,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Rapid and transient induction of gene expression in neurons is necessary for memory formation. Genes
that are activated in the brain in response to stimuli are regulated by the release of a poised transcriptional
state, where RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) pauses just downstream of the gene promoter after initiating
transcription. When calcium-dependent signaling cascades are triggered, the RNAP2 pause is released. This
release allows RNAP2 to elongate across the length of the gene, and messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts are
generated. There is a transcriptional refractory period that lasts for hours after a stimulus when neurons are
transcriptionally unresponsive to subsequent stimuli that may be linked to the time it takes to reset poised
RNAP2. This period of dampened transcriptional response may explain the phenomenon where animals that
have little time between training sessions do not learn as well as animals with more spaced out training
session schedules, despite total training time being equal between groups. Preliminary experiments point to
Hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) as a critical factor for setting up and resetting the
poised state in neurons due to its ability to sequester the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)
protein complex, which is responsible for releasing the RNAP2 transcriptional pause. While other regulators of
P-TEFb have been linked to human cognitive diseases including intellectual disability, Alzheimer’s, mood
disorders, and others, very little is known about HEXIM1 in the brain.
 The central hypothesis of this project is that suppression of P-TEFb by HEXIM1 in neurons is required for
RNAP2 to set up a poised state so a burst of gene expression can be induced in response to a stimulus, and
that while the poised state is getting set up following a transcriptional burst, learning is impaired. I will test this
hypothesis with three specific aims. Aim 1 will explore the regulation of the P-TEFb/HEXIM1 complex by
calcium channels to identify which memory-associated calcium signaling pathways impact P-TEFb activity.
Molecular associations between P-TEFb and HEXIM1, and their dependence on calcium-associated
phosphorylation events will be tested using biochemical assays in primary neuron cultures. Aim 2 will test how
RNAP2 cycles through a set of steps (poise, elongate, disengage, then poise again) that dictate levels of gene
inducibility following neuronal depolarization. Confocal microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and florescence in
situ hybridization will be combined to ascertain the association of inducible genes with nuclear
subcompartments in containing poised, elongating, and inactive RNAP2 during and after neuronal stimulation.
Aim 3 will probe the role of HEXIM1 in memory and determining the rate of learning. Behavioral tests will be
conducted in mice after knockdown or overexpression of the Hexim1 gene in the hippocampus. This career
development award will further develop the translation of my skillsets in studying transcriptional regulation
mechanisms to the study of learning and memory."
10977164,"The NIH HEAL Initiative's OTA-23-007 seeks to enhance wellness among Native Americans by advancing research on overdose, substance use, pain, and mental health. Our project focuses on developing a Clinical Research Unit to implement a systems thinking Native Behavioral Health Effective Coverage Care Model (NBHECCM) for the Absentee Shawnee Tribal community. This
model will use systems analysis to disentangle the complexity underlying these areas of behavioral health to enable us to improve care coordination, identify critical intervention points,
and enhance the overall effectiveness of community health initiatives. We will develop a culturally attuned Native American Community Behavioral Health Systems Framework which includes the relevant thematic domains, stakeholders, and areas of interest relevant to pain management and behavioral health within the Absentee Shawnee Tribe and other indigenous communities. These include the areas of governance, community safety, community services, socioeconomics, family unit, treatment, and health service delivery, among others. Each domain will have specific areas of stakeholder interest. Community representatives from these domains will define the roles and interrelationships within and between these domains. The resulting stakeholder mapping will be used to identify unique and intersecting community interests that are related to overdose, substance use, pain, and behavioral health. To specifically address pain management, we will map community effective coverage, illustrated by Sankey diagrams that represent all potential paths an individual might take through the care continuum (e.g., the onset of pain, care-seeking, diagnosis, the pursuit of care, and ongoing management). This data will be used to create a system for Phase Two to analyze care trajectories and conditional probabilities of actual data to evaluate the cascade of care. This analysis will demonstrate how pain affects the community and identify critical intervention points to improve pain management and overall community wellness.
Our NBHECCM will serve as a robust tool in Phase 2 protocols for understanding and
addressing these complex health issues, aiming to ultimately enhance the quality of care and
wellness in the Absentee Shawnee Tribe community as well as other Native American groups.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and acute and chronic pain."
10977368,"Abstract
The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to utilize the patient’s immune system to reject the invading “foreign”
tumor. However, the pancreatic cancer microenvironment is characterized by an abundance of
immunosuppressive cells and a dense stroma that prevents infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells.
Electroporation is a technique that has been utilized for decades in the laboratory; electrical voltage is applied
to cells to make holes for delivery of DNA and RNA. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a technique now
being used clinically for ablation of localized tumors that cannot be removed surgically (locally advanced
tumors). Our objective is to use IRE as an ""in situ vaccine"" to help the host recognize foreign tumor proteins
(neoantigens) and generate anti-tumor immune responses that will decrease recurrence rates. We have
utilized mouse models of pancreatic cancer to show that IRE generates anti-tumor immune cells that prevent
growth of new tumors (prophylactic immunity). We hypothesize that combining IRE with agents that augment
the immune response will result in inhibition of established, distant tumors (therapeutic immunity or
“abscopal” effects). In Aim 1, we will use mouse models to compare the effects of IRE to radiation therapy
(XRT), as this is the most relevant clinical comparator. Both methods are used clinically for the ablation
(killing) of locally advanced pancreatic cancer but have been shown stimulate systemic immune responses in
preclinical models. We hypothesize that IRE will induce stronger immune responses because XRT causes
fibrosis (scarring) that will inhibit immune cell infiltration. In Aim 2, we will combine local ablation with local
delivery of agents that stimulate the innate immune system in mouse models of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
In Aim 3, we will use a novel model in which human tumors and their associated immune cells are implanted
into immunocompromised mice in order to create a “humanized” immune system. We will use this model to
study the effects of IRE on human tumors. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that encompasses
broad expertise in IRE, mouse tumor models, stromal biology, immunotherapy, clinical trials, and clinical care
of patients with pancreatic cancer. We envision that the combination of IRE with immunotherapy will be first
beneficial to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, if effective, this approach may also
be beneficial to patients with metastatic disease. Since the IRE technique is already in use clinically, a
clinical trial in which one or more of the agents to be studied is delivered during or after IRE as adjuvant
therapy would likely be feasible in the near future. We will use data from the proposed research to design
such a study."
10977371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is growing evidence that limited access to high-quality cancer treatment is one of the main drivers of
higher cancer mortality rates among rural cancer patients. Our analyses of Iowa Cancer Registry data indicate
that 40% of rural patients with breast and colorectal cancers receive most or all definitive treatment in rural
hospitals that do not collect or monitor data on their quality of cancer care, and are not accredited by the
American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC). Our data also shows these patients are less
likely to receive guideline-concordant care. Given patients' needs and preferences to receive cancer care
locally, a promising strategy to improve quality of cancer care and outcomes in rural populations is to intervene
directly with the community hospitals in these areas. New evidence has demonstrated effectiveness of this
approach: the Markey Cancer Center Affiliate Network (MCCAN) was formed by the University of Kentucky
(UK) Markey Cancer Center to improve quality of cancer care in their own rural, low-resourced state, one that
leads the nation in cancer incidence and mortality. Over the last decade MCCAN has facilitated the sharing
and diffusion of resources and best practices throughout their network. As a result, affiliates markedly
improved performance on established, cancer care quality measures and expanded their services (e.g.,
psychosocial and survivorship support). They were also almost 3 times more likely to obtain CoC accreditation
than their matched controls. However, the MCCAN model has not been rigorously defined, evaluated or tested
in any other setting. We propose to adapt this successful health system-level intervention for Iowa, establishing
the Iowa Cancer Affiliate Network (I-CAN). Although there are similarities between Iowa and Kentucky's
populations that suggest the MCCAN model may be a good fit, there are also significant differences in
healthcare infrastructure and resources that require careful adaptation of the intervention prior to its
implementation in order to retain its effectiveness. We will use novel, rigorously developed, theory-based
implementation science methods to identify MCCAN's core functions (i.e., what makes it effective), study the
implementation process and evaluate how I-CAN performs in a new context. We have identified 4 rural, Iowa
hospitals to participate in this intervention trial and developed expert support teams to assist key stakeholder
groups within each hospital. Through interviews and qualitative analyses, we will assess determinants and
outcomes of the implementation process, and perceived value of the CoC accreditation standards and the
intervention itself as a way to improve the quality of cancer care for their patients. We will compare compliance
with treatment-related quality measures and the proportion of CoC standards of cancer care implemented in
target and control hospitals, pre- and post-intervention using a difference-in-difference estimator. This work
could lead to dissemination of similar models across rural settings thereby improving quality of care, reducing
rural disparities in cancer outcomes and giving rural hospitals an avenue to demonstrate their quality of care."
10977372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal malignancy with a 5-year overall survival of <10%.
Lethality is due to late diagnosis, early metastasis and therapeutic resistance. A hallmark characteristic of PDA
is the robust fibroinflammatory and suppressive tumor microenvironment that compresses blood vessels and
restricts drug access. This tumor microenvironment is also believed to interfere with immunotherapies, which are
transforming the standard of care for many other cancer indications. Tumor-antigen specific T cells are
responsible for mediating the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. While much has been learned about
suppressive cells within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment, factors that impact the differentiation program
of antigen-specific T cells and their antitumor activity is markedly understudied in this disease. We created a
novel engineered T cell therapy that shows marked anti-tumor and anti-stromal activity in an aggressive and
difficult to treat genetically engineered PDA animal model that recapitulates many aspects of the human disease,
including response to immunotherapy. T cells engineered to express a tumor-reactive T cell receptor specific to
mesothelin, which is highly expressed by tumor cells yet poorly expressed by normal cells, is safe, destroys the
stroma, alters myeloid cell composition, induces objective responses, and significantly prolongs animal survival.
Notably, engineered T cells preferentially accumulate in primary tumors and metastasis, challenging the dogma
that PDA is immune privileged. Based on this efficacy, candidate T cell receptors specific to mesothelin for use
in patients have been identified leading to a Phase 1 clinical trial. However, despite engineered T cell persistence
and significant antitumor activity in vivo, a principle obstacle to cure is the progressive loss of engineered T cell
function within the suppressive pancreatic tumor microenvironment. While T cell functionality and differentiation
are well-studied in other cancer indications, little is understood regarding how the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment impacts tumor antigen-specific T cells. Here, we incorporate innovative tools we have
developed to identify mechanistically how engineered T cells mediate stromal remodeling, how the tumor adapts
and evades anti-tumor T cells, and then use this knowledge to develop a cutting edge engineered T cell therapy
for patient treatment with strategic advancements as compared to most cell engineering approaches. Our
Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify how engineered T cells mediate stromal remodeling, (2) Identify the contribution
of TCR affinity and the tumor microenvironment on T cell differentiation and functionality, and (3) Test the safety
and efficacy of a novel cell engineering approach for targeting solid tumors. Our studies will identify
characteristics of T cells and the tumor microenvironment that produce durable antitumor responses during
immunotherapy to create safe and durable clinical opportunities for pancreatic cancer patient treatment."
10977490,"Project Abstract:
 Patient-derived model systems are commonly used to study tumor biology and test novel treatments for
head and neck cancer. These models are established using patient tumors sourced from surgical specimens
and typically implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of the mouse. There is little data available to support the
decisions we make during the initial handling of the tumor samples and, most importantly, how these decisions
impact the results of subsequent studies. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for head and neck cancer
patients using valid, predictive, and well characterized model systems. The overall objective of this application
is to improve our use of these mammalian model systems by understanding the impact of choices we make
when we establish them. By combining innovative approaches to study cancer evolution with rigorous
assessment of tumor biology and therapy response we hope to ultimately improve the relevance of studies
using these mammalian models to improve the care of human patients. Our central hypothesis is that the
approach used to establish patient-derived xenografts has a critical impact on their relevance as translational
models.
 To achieve our goals, we proposed three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of heterotopic vs.
orthotopic implantation on the biology of the tumor, how patient-derived animal models change with increasing
passage in animals, and how these factors impact tumor evolution. In Aim 2, we will test the concordance of
response between patient derived models and patients by using patient derived xenografts established as part
of an ongoing (and separately funded) window-of-opportunity trial and will assess consistency in response to
standard treatments over time. In Aim 3, we will use an innovative humanized mouse model developed at
Wisconsin to assess the evolutionary interplay between the tumor and immune system, understand whether
these novel mice replicate the tumor/immune interface seen in human cancers or in syngeneic HNC models,
and investigate how well the response to immunotherapy replicates that seen in patients. In summary, these
studies will provide compelling evidence for how to optimize our use of mouse models of human head and
neck cancer. Completion of this project will provide robust evidence delineating and refining best practices for
the translational use of patient derived xenograft animal models of head and neck cancer."
10978965,"Abstract
Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Advanced PC
patients often receive androgen deprivation therapy, but, the recalcitrant disease recurs within 2-3 years,
referred to as the Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Androgen Receptor (AR) antagonists such
as enzalutamide (Enz) or abiraterone (Abi) are currently favored therapeutics for PC patients, however,
virtually all patients develop resistance. Post-CRPC state, therapeutic options for the recurrent disease are
limited. We discovered a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1, as a novel epigenetic modifier in prostate
tumors, regulating AR/AR-V7 expression. Enthused with these data, we developed a new class of ACK1
small molecule kinase inhibitor, (R)-9b. (R)-9b inhibits ACK1 and downregulates AR and prostate specific
antigen (PSA) expression to suppress prostate xenograft tumor growth. Moreover, in immune competent
mouse models, (R)-9b induces significant CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation against syngeneic prostate
tumors. Employing ex vivo 3-D assays, we confirmed that (R)-9b functionally reinvigorates peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the CRPC patients to mount a robust immune response against human CRPC
organoids. Together, these data indicated that ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9b with tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic
activities in the host tumor microenvironments is a novel class of inhibitor with much needed
immunomodulatory activity. Prolonged (R)-9b treatment exhibited normal histology suggesting that it is not
associated with toxicity, further underscoring the importance of targeting ACK1 to overcome resistance to
AR-targeted therapies. We have completed an extensive pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) studies
including pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and metabolism studies in mouse/rat/canine models, which
revealed that (R)-9b possessed excellent drug-like properties. These data is submitted to FDA
(IND#167907). This proposal is directed towards phase I clinical trial for ACK1 inhibitor (R)-9b in CRPC
patients to examine its ability to overcome CRPC resistance by cytotoxic and immunomodulatory activity.
Specifically, we will:
Specific Aim 1: To assess the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of (R)-9b in CPRC
patients
Specific Aim 2: To evaluate peripheral blood and tissue markers of anti-tumor and immune response after
(R)-9b exposure.
Overall, successful completion of this study will open a new therapeutic modality for CRPC patients who
have developed resistance for Enzalutamide and Abiraterone, which is a critical unmet need."
10978966,"Our preliminary data suggest that inflamed adipose tissue may contribute to blunted exercise response in
skeletal muscle of older adults. The objective of this project is to evaluate a hypothesis that inflamed adipose
secretes factors that activate inflammatory cascades in skeletal muscle, which may interfere with exercise-
responsive molecular pathways and contribute to dysfunctional muscle phenotypes with aging.
Aim 1 will determine how adipose tissue influences skeletal muscle function and anabolic response to
exercise in older adults. A combination of in vivo imaging and molecular phenotyping will be used to
characterize abdominal adipose tissue (AAT) and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) in young and older
adults. Molecular response to acute exercise will be determined from protein synthesis rates, exercise-
responsive mRNAs, and activation of signaling proteins in muscle. This aim will evaluate the relationship
between adipose tissue inflammation and skeletal muscle phenotypes and function in older adults.
Aim 2 will identify the molecular pathways by which AAT and IMAT influence muscle phenotype and
exercise response in older adults. Primary muscle cultures and adipose conditioned media (AAT, IMAT) will
be generated from tissue collected in aim 1. Myotubes will be exposed to adipose explant media or serum
from inflamed or non-inflamed donors to evaluate their influence on molecular phenotype and response to
exercise mimetics in vitro. Chemical inhibition of canonical inflammatory pathways in muscle will be used to
determine their role in attenuating molecular response to exercise. Molecular profiling of conditioned media
and serum will be used to identify candidate molecules for subsequent experiments to assess their individual
influence on canonical exercise response pathways.
The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be in the form of new insights into the
paracrine/endocrine influence of adipose tissue on skeletal muscle responsiveness to exercise in older adults.
The knowledge gained in the proposed study will have a positive impact because anabolic resistance is
common in older adults and believed to contribute to sarcopenia, frailty, and loss of independence. This work
will provide insight into the link between adipose tissue dysfunction and skeletal muscle biology in aging with a
particular focus on distinct adipose tissue pools that are likely to have unique endocrine or paracrine influence
on skeletal muscle. We will also gain new knowledge of how targeting inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue
and skeletal muscle may enhance acute adaptations to exercise in older adults."

PARP inhibitors-based synthetic lethal therapy, such as BMN673 (Talazoparib), shows great efficacy for BRCA
mutated (or homologous recombination repair (HRR)-deficient) cancers in preclinical and clinical studies, but
demonstrates limited efficacy for majority of cancer types that are HRR proficient. To improve the PARPi efficacy
and extend their therapeutic application, additional combination approaches are necessary. 5-azacytidine (AZA)
is a DNA methylation inhibitor, which shows increasing clinical use for epigenetic therapy of solid tumors. AZA
has been reported to enhance PARPi response through trapping large DNMT-PARP1 complexes to DNA break
sites and enhancing formation of cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs). Based on our preliminary data and data
from others, AZA may also affect DNA repair, inducing HRR defects and sensitizing tumors to PARPi. Moreover,
we hypothesize that combination of AZA with BMN673 may enhance the tumor immune response through
generation of novel neoantigens and upregulation of MHC class I molecules. However, the effectiveness of this
combination therapy is limited by the poor bioavailability of the two drugs and the challenge of codelivery to
tumors due to the distinct physiochemical properties of BMN and Aza. In our preliminary studies, we developed
a small sized nanocarrier that could selectively accumulate in the tumors and effectively penetrate to the core of
experimental tumors, importantly, it could efficiently load both hydrophilic AZA and hydrophobic agent BMN673
and was more effective in suppressing tumor growth in PARPi-insensitive NSCLC tumor models at relatively
lower doses. We propose to further optimize the BMN/PAZA formulation (Aim 1) and evaluate their in vivo
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and tumor penetration efficiency using tumor models that closely mimic human
NSCLC (Aim 2). We will also investigate the therapeutic efficacy and the underlying mechanism (Aim 3). These
studies will address the issues of off-target toxicity of AZA and PARPi, and provide a promising and safe strategy
to expand the clinical use of synthetic lethal therapy to both HRR-deficient and HRR-proficient cancer patients."

The functional annotation of proteins is a major bottleneck of biological discovery in the post-genomic era. We
are able to accurately generate large swaths of genomic and metagenomic sequence data. We are also able,
to a lesser extent, to assemble those sequences correctly, and identify open reading frames. Our capability to
accurately generate biological knowledge from genomic data drops precipitously at the third step: assigning the
biological function to proteins. The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation, or CAFA is a computational
challenge that involves a community of computational biologists, data scientists, ontologists, and biocurators
working together to improve and distribute protein function prediction algorithms. Here we propose (i) to
sustain and enrich the CAFA community of practice by continuing the CAFA challenges, while involving
biocurators and computer scientists not regularly associated with this community. This will be accomplished by
increasing the engagement with other communities and by incentivizing the development of containerized and
Open Source software to be incorporated into continuous use in UniProt; (ii) to drive continuous improvement
in gene function prediction and annotation by transitioning CAFA to a continuous event and by developing
algorithms that prioritize proteins for biocuration and experimental annotation; (iii) to use annotation extensions
and subsequently the Gene Ontology Causal Activity Model to capture causal relationships between the
functionality of proteins, and then challenge the function prediction algorithms to adopt causal annotation
models. This project shifts the field of computational function prediction to drive the accurate annotation of
protein function in a fine-grained, context-dependent, and causal manner."
10978704,"Currently, there are no approved interventions that significantly attenuate the acute injury and inflammatory
response in the initial early (< 24 h) phase following SCI which leads to neuronal death. Following the initial
trauma of spinal cord injury (SCI), a secondary cascade of events characterized by damage to the vasculature
of the spinal cord occurs, triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. The main source of ROS (reactive oxygen
species; free radicals) production is the mitochondria. During tissue injury, calcium is released which activates
mitochondrial proteins. The hyperactivate mitochondria dramatically increase ROS production, which then
initiate cellular death cascades causing further damage to the spinal cord and inhibit neuronal regeneration.
Thus, there is an urgent need to reduce ROS production and to re-establish mitochondrial homeostasis soon
after SCI. A critical challenge, however, in addressing SCI is to devise an intervention that attenuates the acute
phase of injury (<24 h) to positively impact long term functional mobility. Pharmaceutical agents are limited
because 1) they must be delivered through the bloodstream causing a significant delay for building up efficient
concentrations at the target site, 2) act systemically, and 3) must cross several membrane systems (i.e., blood-
spinal cord barrier), therefore, resulting in a major delay to establish effective intracellular and more precisely
intramitochondrial concentrations to restore mitochondrial homeostasis. To overcome the limitations of drug
delivery we have discovered, for the first time, specific wavelengths of infrared light (IRL) that allows us to control
a key mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Our central hypothesis, supported by strong rodent
data, is that application of IRL normalizes mitochondrial hyperactivity in the injured spinal cord, leading to robust
neuroprotection. Our IRL technology circumvents the intrinsic barriers of pharmacological approaches because
1) it is noninvasive and safe, 2) can begin prior to surgical decompression and stabilization; 3) instead of
scavenging ROS, our technology prevents the generation of ROS by normalizing electron transport chain (ETC)
function post injury, 4) it is applied locally at the site of injury and not systemically, 5) does not depend on delivery
by blood flow, 6) the effect on COX activity is immediate and fully reversible, 7) it has therapeutic application that
can be easily achieved and implemented at the crucial early phase of SCI, and 8) it can seamlessly be translated
into the clinic. To test our hypothesis and achieve our objective of developing a therapeutic medical device for
treatment of traumatic SCI, we will: Aim 1: Optimize inhibition of the mitochondrial hyperactivity following SCI
using our noninvasive infrared light technology in the rat small animal model of contusion SCI; Aim 2: To
demonstrate delivery of therapeutic doses of infrared light in live pigs, human cadavers, and computer
simulations. Aim 3: To develop the spinal cord targeted human IRL delivery system, SpinaLUX. This novel
approach identifies and answers key gaps in spinal cord injury research that will help move the field forward."

Angioplasty is commonly performed to press open occluded coronary and peripheral arteries. Unfortunately, this
invasive procedure often induces smooth muscle cell dysfunction and intimal hyperplasia (IH) that re-narrows
the vascular lumen, leading to recurrent disease. Mechanical stretching of the artery can cause injury to endo-
thelial cells (ECs), leading to inflammation and thrombosis which further exacerbate IH. We previously found that
elevated expression of ALDH1A3, known as a cytosolic metabolism coordinator, is present in human and rodent
neointimal tissues, and that pharmacological inhibition of ALDH1A3 ameliorates IH in an angioplasty-induced
animal model. Here we present new findings to suggest that molecular knockdown of ALDH1A3 enhances re-
covery of ECs following angioplasty injury, via a novel nuclear action of ALDH1A3 on the transcriptional control
of KFL2, a known master regulator of EC proliferation and inflammation. We find that siRNA knockdown of
ALDH1A3 enhances EC scratch-wound healing in vitro, associated with upregulation of EC-protective genes
(e.g. eNOS) and down-regulation of EC-detrimental (e.g. inflammatory) genes. ALDH1A3 forms a complex with
the acetyltransferase p300 and pro-inflammatory transcription factor p65, and knockdown of ALDH1A3 reduces
acetylation and stability of p65 and consequently p65’s negative impact on KLF2 expression in ECs. We have
promising in vivo findings that targeted suppression of ALDH1A3 can protect EC function and mitigate IH in rats.
Overall, our findings support the premise that ALDH1A3 knockdown may provide a novel EC-protective approach
to IH mitigation. Toward translation, we have generated an injectable siRNA-loaded Biomimetic Torpedo – a
capsule of neutrophil membranes hybridized with liposomes that enables wound-targeted delivery of the siRNA
payload to the injured ECs. By resolving the EC-specific role of ALDH1A3 in EC impairment associated with IH
and its nuclear action in regulating KLF2 function, we can advance the understanding of IH pathophysiology
(Aim 1). By developing Biomimetic Torpedo for targeted delivery of siRNA against ALDH1A3, our work may lead
to a stent-free, EC-protective new paradigm for post-angioplasty management of IH (Aim 2)."

Metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, is now one of the main risk factors for adverse liver outcomes, and Hispanic/Latino adults have the
highest prevalence of MASLD compared to all other major racial/ethnic groups. Modifying diet and physical
activity to achieve clinically significant weight loss (≥5%) is the only current treatment for MASLD. There is an
urgent need to develop a culturally appropriate, multilevel, multidomain behavioral lifestyle intervention that
provides disease-specific education and support and that also addresses the upstream influences on lifestyle
behavior change in Hispanic/Latino patients with MASLD. The purpose of this K01 award is to prepare Dr.
Natalia Heredia with the training and experience necessary to achieve her career goal of becoming an
independent investigator focused on designing and implementing multilevel interventions to prevent and treat
lifestyle-related conditions in Hispanic/Latino populations. Through both career development activities and the
mentored research project, the proposed development plan is intended to ensure Dr. Heredia receives training
in 1) multilevel lifestyle intervention development and implementation; 2) dissemination and implementation
(D&I) research methods, including the adaptation of evidence-based interventions, and the use of mixed-
methods research and hybrid-effectiveness designs; 3) liver disease diagnosis and management; and 4)
statistical methods for testing multilevel lifestyle interventions. Dr. Heredia's mentoring team is composed of
experts in lifestyle behaviors and interventions (Dr. Lorna McNeill, co-primary mentor), D&I research and
Hispanic/Latino health (Dr. Maria Fernandez, co-primary mentor), liver disease (Dr. Jessica Hwang, co-
mentor), and statistical methods for testing interventions (Dr. MinJae Lee, co-mentor). With guidance from her
mentors, Dr. Heredia will adapt and pilot test a culturally appropriate multilevel, multidomain behavioral lifestyle
intervention to achieve important changes in physical activity and diet, promote weight loss, and improve liver-
related outcomes for Hispanic/Latino patients with MASLD. The study aims are to 1) adapt an individual-level
lifestyle intervention for Hispanic/Latino patients with MASLD such that it addresses multiple levels and
domains of influence, emphasizing the role of family members, healthcare providers, and access to social
services, 2) using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, conduct a quasi-experimental pilot study
of the multilevel intervention to assess feasibility and preliminary effectiveness, and 3) explore patient, family,
and provider experiences in the pilot study to explain findings and refine the multilevel, multidomain
intervention. Completion of the study will result in a finalized multilevel lifestyle intervention to support an R01
application for a full-scale trial evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the intervention. Completion
of the proposed research and training aims will provide Dr. Heredia with the skills and experience necessary to
launch a successful career as an independent investigator focused on minority health and health disparities."

Diabetes is broadly classified as type 1 diabetes (T1D), with primary defect in insulin production due to
autoimmune destruction of beta cells, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with primary defect in insulin sensitivity in
organs that regulate energy metabolism. There is an emerging conceptual change that diabetes is not
composed of discrete sets of syndromes but a spectrum of heterogenous phenotypes with complex
pathophysiology across different ethnic and racial populations. More than 90% of adult patients with diabetes
are classified as T2D with variable clinical risk factors, prognosis, and treatment response. There is an unmet
need to assess individual risk for developing diabetes, its complications, and drug response based on
underlying pathophysiology, which change over time. This proposal will embark on studies of large-scale
electronic health records (EHRs) with comprehensive phenome assessed during the course of diabetes, and
multi-omics integration, to address the following Specific Aims. AIM 1: Classification of diabetes subtypes using
clinical features in EHRs of diverse ancestries. AIM 2: Classification of diabetes subtypes in response to
treatments for diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases in EHRs of diverse ancestries. AIM 3: Multi-omics
characterization of diabetes subtypes in African Americans. Successful implementation of the proposal will
build a framework to identify subtypes of diabetes and their underlying physiological drivers to impact clinical
practice towards more precise diagnosis, prognosis, and effective intervention."

Interventions are critically needed to address the maternal mental health crisis in the United
States, particularly since mental illness is now the leading cause of maternal mortality.
Unprecedented societal shifts, disparities in access to mental health care, stigma, reluctance to
use psychiatric medications, and inflammation associated with uncontrolled mental illness all
highlight the need for simple, scalable, and equitable solutions in pregnancy. Developing
solutions tailored to specific aspects of this problem is an essential first step. However, there is
a significant knowledge gap in how mental illness contributes to maternal morbidity and
mortality which must first be understood to direct risk reduction strategies. One approach to
doing this involves studying severe maternal morbidity (SMM), a composite of severe
complications that often precede death yet occur 70 times more frequently. In preliminary work,
Dr. Panelli found that the risk of SMM is 58% higher in people with mental illness yet the relative
contribution of other factors such as substance use and medical comorbidities to this risk
remains to be elucidated. To address these knowledge gaps and prepare for a career as an
independent clinician scientist in this field, Dr. Panelli has developed this innovative K23
proposal to reduce SMM due to mental illness through identifiable behavioral and biologic
pathways. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify casual pathways for increased SMM in people
with depression and anxiety – the two most common perinatal mental illnesses – using a
population-level approach with Veteran’s Health Administration (VA) data; and 2) Conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a physical activity intervention in pregnant people with
mental illness to reduce severity of depression and/or anxiety and lower stress biomarkers
(leukocyte telomere length and hair cortisol). These aims will be conducted in parallel to provide
complimentary preliminary data to inform an R01 RCT of a physical activity intervention to
reduce SMM in people with mental illness. Dr. Panelli’s training will be conducted under the
experienced mentorship of Drs. Carmichael (perinatal epidemiologist), Phibbs (health
economist), and Gotlib (clinical psychologist/neuroscientist), in conjunction with advisors in
lifestyle interventions (Dr. Pinto) and RCT design (Dr. Lyell). Support from this K23, which will
feature content training in perinatal mental illness, hands-on analysis of population-level data
with advanced epidemiologic methods, and experience with clinical trials, will advance Dr.
Panelli’s long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher with expertise in the
complex physical and biological interrelationship between mental illness, pregnancy, and SMM."
10984162,"Project Summary
Approximately one-third of individuals without dementia at the time of death are found to harbor high levels of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, including amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, at autopsy. We
hypothesize that such individuals exhibit physiological resilience that confers the ability to maintain cognitive
function despite the accumulation of AD-related pathologies. The identification of the specific mechanisms by
which these older individuals with Alzheimer’s disease pathology avoid dementia is one of the most pivotal,
unanswered questions in the field. Cognitive impairment in AD is the result of synapse loss in brain regions that
are critical for memory processes. Our work and that of others has demonstrated that synaptic markers and
dendritic spine loss correlate more strongly with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease than accumulation
of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This implies that the ability to maintain cognitive function in an
environment of AD pathology must be linked to the preservation and maintenance of synapses or spines.
Aberrant tau accumulation is a strong pathological correlate of cognitive decline both in normal aging and
Alzheimer’s disease. Abnormal tau initially accumulates in somatodendritic compartments among layer 2/3
neurons in the entorhinal cortex, and is thought to spread to anatomically connected regions via synaptic
connections. These findings suggest that aberrantly phosphorylated tau seeds residing in synaptic
compartments are crucial to the spread or propagation of tau pathology in aging and Alzheimer’s disease
patients. The extent of neurofibrillary tangle spread through the brain correlates with the severity of cognitive
impairment, and thus, halting spread of tau pathology may represent a plausible mechanism of resilience to age-
related memory loss or Alzheimer’s disease. This raises important questions: do resilient patients harbor less
pathogenic tau seeds in synaptic compartments or are their synapses more resilient to tau? What are the
synaptic proteins and cellular pathways that associate with tau seeding and tau-induced synaptotoxicity in
resilient patients? The goal of this R21 is to address these provocative questions to open new doors of
investigation by identifying putative therapeutic protein targets that are linked to modulating tau seeding, tau-
induced synaptic dysfunction and synapse preservation in Alzheimer’s disease."
10984176,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current COVID-19 vaccines fail to induce strong cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against circulating SARS-
CoV-2 variants, which have undergone extensive mutation in the neutralizing epitopes of spike protein. Booster
vaccinations with variant-matched vaccines primarily strengthen immunity towards epitopes shared with the
original strain, leading to poor neutralizing activity against variants and failing to induce strong protection. This
biased immune response towards the ancestral strain is termed “original antigenic sin”. It results in repeated
infections with new variants regardless of vaccination status.
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an improved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that can induce broadly cross-
reactive neutralizing antibody responses against current and future variants by targeting a highly conserved
epitope in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of the spike protein. When presented on spike protein, it is poorly
immunogenic and anti-HR1 antibodies rarely form naturally. Dr. Stampfer has developed an engineered antigen,
composed only of the HR1 epitope, that induces high titer anti-HR1 antibodies in mice. This immunogen also
functions as a scaffold when linked to an additional epitope, the receptor binding motif (RBM), which mutates
frequently between different SARS-CoV-2 variants and can induce very potent neutralizing antibodies. The HR1
portion of such a vaccine has the potential to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies against all variants, while
the RBM portion can function as a seasonal component targeting current circulating strains, all without boosting
non-neutralizing cross-reactive epitopes on spike protein. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 investigates the
immunogenicity and protection of the HR1 and RBM-HR1 vaccines against the current circulating SARS-CoV-2
variants in naïve mice, while Aim 2 evaluates their efficacy as boosters in mice with prior mRNA COVID-19
vaccination. Aim 3 will isolate vaccine-induced HR1-specific B-cells to generate broadly-active anti-HR1
monoclonal antibodies for prophylactic and therapeutic evaluation in mouse challenge experiments. Long term,
this lays the groundwork for future larger projects testing the optimized vaccine and anti-HR1 therapeutics in
nonhuman primates and humans, and in designing HR1-based vaccines for other viruses.
The research will be conducted at the Emory Vaccine Center, with multiple vaccinology labs whose close
proximity encourages new collaborations and the sharing of methodology and equipment, along with on-site
nonhuman primates for future preclinical vaccine testing. Dr. Stampfer’s career goal is to develop better
vaccines for viral pathogens by using protein structure data to design antigens that induce strong immunity to
critical epitopes. His career development plan includes hands-on training in vaccine development, neutralization
assays, and monoclonal antibody isolation, along with didactic and online courses in immunology, antibody
engineering, biostatistics, and grant-writing. The mentorship team of physician-scientists and viral vaccinologists
will ensure productive research and training, helping him launch his career as an independent researcher."

developing psychiatric disorders including Substance Use Disorders (SUD). Animal studies have also shown
that juvenile social isolation (jSI) dysregulates adult social and cognitive behaviors relevant to SUD. However,
how early isolation alters the developmental trajectory of circuits and behaviors implicated in SUD is poorly
understood. Our long-term goal is to elucidate neural mechanisms mediating the impact of jSI on
neurobehavioral development and the risk for SUD in adolescence and adulthood. Among many brain regions,
prefrontal cortex (PFC), which provides top-down control to sub-cortical areas essential for reward processing,
has been extensively implicated to be dysregulated in SUD. it is hypothesized that jSI dysregulates adolescent
reciprocal social interaction, which leads to an imbalance between the two types of subcortically projecting mPFC
neurons, ultimately contributing to SUD-relevant cognitive behavior deficits. This project will conduct the
preparative activities at the behavioral (Aim1) and circuit level (Aim2) that are essential to establish feasibility
and validity to test the aforementioned hypothesis. To this end we will form an interdisciplinary team with
expertise in developmental psychobiology, circuit manipulation/measurement, behavioral electrophysiology,
machine learning-based behavioral analysis, and SUD-related cognitive behavior in rodent models, as well as
expertise in human developmental psychology and human SUD-related developmental imaging studies. These
preparatory activities will set a stage for a future project to conduct multimodal longitudinal study using rat models
to examine the impact of juvenile social isolation on PFC circuit maturation, social play trajectory, and adult SUD
related behavior."

The incidence of Endometrial Cancer (EC) has been rising, with a notable increase in mortality rates, especially
among Black women who face a higher risk of aggressive EC subtypes. Current diagnostic methods for EC are
invasive, costly, and typically utilized in advanced stages of the disease, highlighting a critical need for early
detection techniques. This project aims to enhance early EC detection and understand the complex interplay of
genetic, social, and environmental factors contributing to EC risk, with a focus on addressing disparities in EC
outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups. In the proposed research, we aim to determine the burden
of rare germline pathogenic variation associated with endometrial cancer risk in racially and ethnically diverse
case control cohorts utilizing the All of USs biobank datasets. This approach will provide new insights into the
genetic factors influencing EC, especially in underrepresented populations. We will create advanced risk models
that integrate a wide array of risk factors, including genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors, into
comprehensive predictive models, combining genetic data with non-genetic factors (e.g., BMI, diabetes history,
PCOS) and validated across different racial and ethnic subgroups, offering a personalized risk assessment tool
for EC. The successful completion of this project will yield a comprehensive understanding of the genetic and
non-genetic factors contributing to EC risk, particularly in racial and ethnic groups that have been historically
understudied. The development of integrated risk models will facilitate early detection of EC, leading to timely
interventions and potentially better survival rates. This project has the potential to revolutionize EC screening
and prevention strategies, making them more effective and accessible across diverse populations, thereby
addressing a significant public health concern.

10985323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) is a disorder characterized by chronic coughing, which leads to
serious health sequelae such broken ribs, unintended urine leakage, and fainting. Because coughing is a
respiratory symptom across a variety of chronic lung diseases, the investigation of CHS aligns with the
research priorities identified in the Strategic Vision of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A critical
barrier to progress is that clinical practice presents two distinct treatment approaches for CHS. Pharmacologic
options include neuromodulating medications and nerve block injections, while nonpharmacologic options rely
on cognitive behavioral principles via speech therapy. The lack of empirical evidence to guide which of these
extremely different treatments to recommend for an individual patient results in a trial-and-error approach,
resulting in increased misdiagnosis and unnecessary, risky, and expensive treatments. The exact components
of nonpharmacologic speech therapy that target underlying mechanisms of change in CHS remain unknown,
presenting a barrier to future treatment optimization. The central rationale for the proposed research is that
cough symptomology can identify CHS patient subgroups, which will more accurately predict which patients
respond to different CHS treatments. Preliminary work demonstrates that the symptom of the urge-to-cough
using the general Labeled Magnitude Scale successfully detects changes in healthy adults, which needs to be
trialed as a metric of cough symptomology in patients with CHS. The current project addresses these critical
gaps by (Aim 1) investigating whether cough symptoms predict responses to treatments for CHS, and (Aim 2)
determining the feasibility of a pilot randomized controlled trial of a nonpharmacologic treatment, acceptance
and commitment therapy, in patients with CHS. Aim 1 will provide essential clinical guidance by establishing a
scientifically informed approach to predict which patients with CHS are candidates for pharmacologic versus
nonpharmacologic treatments. Aim 2 will demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary data for
pursuing larger randomized controlled trials in specific nonpharmacologic interventions for CHS. The proposed
K23 award will address these research needs by focusing on essential career development training in the
areas of clinical trials, cough neurobiology, respiratory psychology, and scientific leadership. Taken together,
completion of the proposed project will logically lead to an independent patient-oriented research program
focused on improving symptom burden and quality of life in patients with CHS across the spectrum of chronic
lung disease."

Currently, there are almost 55 million people living with dementia worldwide, and this number is estimated to
double every 20 years, reaching about 131.5 million in 2050. Most of the patients suffering from dementia (58%)
live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), with the fastest growth in the elderly population taking place in
China, Pakistan, and their South Asian and Western Pacific neighbors. Pakistan is the fifth most populous
country in the world and currently has an estimated 150,000–200,000 patients with dementia. Importantly, more
than 63% of all marital unions in Pakistan are consanguineous posing a greater impact on genetically transmitted
diseases like AD. Consanguinity, although prevalent in densely populated LMICs (e.g., Middle Eastern and North
African countries), is gravely underrepresented in current international AD research initiatives. Thus, including
the Pakistani population, provides a unique opportunity to further diversify genomic studies of AD and related
dementia. Therefore, the ENIGMA-PAK team along with Aga Khan University (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and
NIA-funded ADSP investigators have joined hands to conduct a pilot study to establish feasibility and collect
preliminary genetic data from a consanguineous cohort (n=200) from an urban and a peri-urban site in Pakistan.
Additionally, MRI data from 10 individuals will also be collected on ADNI-3 protocol to show feasibility. The study
will leverage existing NIA-funded resources, including (1) Urdu-translated consent forms and instruments as well
as data protocol from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India - Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD)
study, which is based in India; (2) NIA-funded National Cell Repository for AD (NCRAD) and NIA Genetics of
Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage (NIAGADS) which will process and store genetic data; and (3) the Phenotype
Harmonization Center (PHC) to harmonize the phenotypic data. The main aims of this feasibility study are to
harmonize data acquisition with the protocol used in the LASI-DAD study (Aim 1), collect blood and MRI data
from small cohorts and to harmonize both genetic and phenotypic data with NIA-funded ADSP cores (Aim 2).
Eventually, the goal is to acquire feasibility data from Pakistan that is verified and harmonized by the ADSP cores
to allow us to pursue subsequent NIA funding under the “ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) 2.0: The Diverse
Population Initiative''."

Brought on by anthropogenic causes, disasters have increased in number, intensity, costliness, and human
impact, including public health. Over the same period, drug-related morbidity, mortality, and dependence have
increased dramatically. While research has shown that experiencing a disaster affects physical and mental
health, the literature on disasters’ effects on substance use outcomes is often limited to single disasters (e.g.,
Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy), based on convenience or opportunistic samples that are difficult to generalize
across disasters, and with equivocal findings. This research study will use quasi-experimental methods and a
robust disaster database to examine the impact of disasters on aggregate-level mortality and individual-level
substance use over an extended period, including examining intervening mechanisms through which disasters
are hypothesized to operate using a Big Events conceptual model. For disaster data, we will employ a currently
underutilized dataset within public health research: the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster
Declaration Database, a temporally-specific and geocoded dataset containing all disaster declarations in the
U.S. dating back to 1964. We will combine this information with county-level mortality data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and drug arrest data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, individual-level data
on use, distress, and treatment gaps from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and control variables
from the U.S. Census Bureau. Taking advantage of the exogenous nature of disasters, often used as a
statistical instrument, we will employ quasi-experimental methods to estimate the main effects of disaster
occurrence as well as the mechanisms though which disasters operate, including psychological distress,
treatment disruption, and drug market disruption. In addition to county fixed-effects in aggregate analyses, both
levels of analysis will incorporate temporal and spatial variability in order to understand how disaster effects
diffuse over both dimensions. Finally, we will conduct these analyses by key demographics of both the county
and individual, including sex, race/ethnicity, education, and urbanicity, which will permit the identification of
fundamental causes of health disparities. Our proposed research provides an opportunity to test the effects of
two phenomena that have greatly impacted public health. We will also contribute in additional ways. First, the
examination of mechanisms through which disasters operate will identify which resources need immediate
redress in the face of disaster to curb adverse substance use outcomes. Second, the identification of possible
health disparities in the effects of disasters on substance use outcomes can assist in knowing where and how
resources can be deployed to facilitate more equitable outcomes. Finally, we will create and make publicly
available a county by month database of nearly 50 years of disaster data for future researchers to use to
examine additional public health outcomes, which grows even more important given the anticipated
continuation of global climate change."

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that accounts for approximately
10-20% of all breast carcinomas and is often associated with poor prognosis. While conventional therapies such
as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapies help the management of TNBC, most patients still
develop distant metastasis and have a low overall survival rate. To date, there are only a few specific treatment
options approved for this tumor subgroup, and the development of novel targeted therapies is an unmet need.
Importantly, TNBC often presents as advanced disease, and these tumors are also often bereft of recognized
molecular targets that can be found in other subtypes, limiting their therapeutic options. However, tumor-
associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration in TNBC is frequently observed, and the complex interplay between
immune cells and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to disease progression.
Specifically, signals generated in the TME can cause immunosuppression, promoting angiogenesis and immune
evasion, which leads to tumor development. The interplay of M1 and M2 macrophage populations that coincide
with these tumor markers are particularly important in the TME. Moreover, a high density of TAMs, particularly
M2 macrophages, is associated with poorer outcomes in various cancers, including TNBC. This provides a
strong basis for exploiting TAMs as potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, novel efforts to increase M2 to M1
repolarization are promising therapeutic approaches in TNBC. Here we propose a two-pronged approach to
target the M2-rich TAM population, reversing immune subversion, combined with the targeted destruction of the
tumor cell population, using a gene delivery approach. Prokaryotic viruses such as bacteriophage have no
tropism for mammalian cells, but can be engineered to deliver genes with low efficiency. On the other hand,
animal viruses have potential for targeted gene therapy but require elimination of native tropism for mammalian
cells, so we combined the favorable biological attributes of eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses to facilitate
targeted systemic gene therapy applications. In Aim 1, we will explore the unique attributes of AAVP, a targeted
hybrid vector containing cis-genomic elements from adeno-associated virus (AAV) and phage (P) displaying
ligand motifs to target multiple compartments of TNBC—tumor cell and associated vasculature with RGD4C and
TAM with CSSTRESAC—and deliver human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to modulate the tumor
microenvironment in a syngeneic model of TNBC. Aim 2 is dedicated to the characterization of the
immunomodulatory effects of TNF expression within the tumor microenvironment and the potential repolarization
of anti-inflammatory M2-like TAMs to a pro-inflammatory M1-like TAM population."
10986637,"Project Summary: Respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-Cov-2 pose a continuing and substantive
threat to human health in the US and globally. Respiratory viral infection triggers host innate and adaptive
immune responses, which are the critical antiviral defense mechanisms to control virus replication and spread.
This R21 proposal seeks to identify the critical host immune modulators following influenza A virus (IAV)
infection. In this project, we will investigate transcription factor Runx3 regulation of lung conventional dendritic
cell (DC) subset-2 (cDC2) in priming non-Th1 CD4+ T cell subsets during IAV infection. We recently generated
an inducible Runx3 global knockout (KO) mouse model and reported that Runx3 KO resulted in a huge
reduction (>85%) in numbers of lung CD8+ cytotoxic T cells during IAV infection but increased the numbers of
lung CD4+ T and innate immune cells as well as the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. As a result, the
general Runx3 KO mice tended to have a better survival outcome following IAV infection, although not
statistically significant. Since lung CD8+ cytotoxic T cells play a central role in the clearance of IAV, our findings
suggest that Runx3 KO may augment type-1 immunity to compensate for the loss of lung CD8+ cytotoxic T
cells. We further found that Runx3 was strongly expressed in CD11c+ immune cells from IAV-infected mouse
lungs. Lung CD11c-expressing cells include DCs and tissue resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs). Our
new preliminary data indicate that Runx3 is not expressed and could not be induced by Th1 and Th2 cytokines
in isolated TR-AMs but is expressed and readily inducible in activated DCs. Furthermore, CD11c-specific
Runx3 KO mice were largely (62.5%) resistant to a lethal IAV infection, while all the littermate control mice
succumbed to the lethal IAV infection. Our findings suggest that Runx3 deficiency in CD11c+ lung DCs may
augment host immunity for a better clearance of IAV. As Runx3 expression is mainly restricted to cDC2, we
hypothesize that Runx3 plays an important role in lung cDC2 development, maturation and priming of non-Th1
CD4+ T cell subsets, through which impacts host immune responses and the outcomes of IAV infection. We
expect that cDC2-specific deficiency of Runx3 would suppress Th2 and Treg responses and result in a host
immune balance skewing to Th1 immunity, which would favor for an effective IAV clearance and be beneficial
to the outcomes of lethal IAV infection. We will test the novel hypothesis by using the CD11c- and cDC2-
specific Runx3 KO mouse models. The proposed studies have not been explored previously and will enable us
to identify novel factors and pathways that prevent optimal immunity against IAV infection. The proposal will
also lead to a comprehensive understanding of Runx3 regulation of T cell immunity during respiratory viral
infection and thereby will advance the field."
10986144,"This project seeks to reduce the burden of freezing of gait (FoG), which is suffered by over 50% of people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). FoG is a common, devastating manifestation of PD for which there is no cure or adequate medical or surgical treatment. FoG has been defined as a “brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet, despite the intention to walk”. It is widely known that FoG episodes are frequently triggered by various environmental and psychological factors. The most commonly recognized triggers include start hesitation (freezing upon gait initiation), walking through tight quarters, turn hesitation (freezing when changing directions), approaching a visual target, dual tasking, and stressful, time sensitive situations such
as entering an elevator before the doors close. Each individual with PD is unique with regard to how sensitive they are to these various triggers, underscoring the need for customized therapeutic approaches. A promising option for treating FoG is the use of tactile stimulation, however, no technology to date can provide customized therapy that adapts to the individual’s needs with regard to the specific triggering scenarios. In this proposed project, the Virginia Commonwealth University and William & Mary teams will work together to develop novel technology that deploys context-specific vibration stimuli tailored to the individual’s needs, with the goal of preventing or mitigating FoG. In Task 1, we will design and develop a wearable system for automatic FoG
detection and vibration delivery using existing technology (Ultigesture UG motion sensors, PDVibe3, and a smartphone). The device will be able to detect FoG immediately upon occurrence. In Task 2, we will determine the optimum dose of vibration frequency and amplitude for the five most common environmental and psychological triggers for FoG in a controlled environment (in the clinical lab). In Task 3, we will integrate a global positioning mechanism into the wearable system so that the device can recognize environmental triggers of FoG.
We will program the optimal parameters of vibration determined in Task 2 (for each of the five triggers) to deploy in response to corresponding environmental and psychological triggers and will test it in a real-world setting (a public place). Upon completion of this project we will have created and tested a closed-loop system that will deliver customized vibration therapy to people with PD at the precise moment it is needed to prevent or mitigate FoG episodes. This project aligns directly with the NINDS mission to reduce the burden of neurological diseases such as PD."

The overall technical goal of the predicate Phase I project is to adapt a compact, simple-to-operate capillary
liquid chromatography (LC) platform based on Axcend’s compact Focus LC for near real-time sensitive and
accurate screening of patients for drugs of abuse (DOA) usage, which would deliver essential analytical
information to clinicians in point-of-care (POC) facilities (i.e., pain clinics and drug treatment centers) immediately
after patient urine samples are taken. The goal is to provide much more timely and effective treatment to patients
undergoing drug rehabilitation compared to the current alternatives characterized by sophisticated technology,
inadequate specificity, and/or long turn-around time. This will be accomplished by modifying the LC platform and
developing simple, automated, robust sample preparation workflows and devices. This development will address
a critical need in the healthcare industry for patients requiring treatment for abuse drug use. The overall business
goal of our predicate Phase I project and, therefore, the motivation behind our proposed participation in the I-
Corps program, is to identify the best potential markets for the main product of Axcend, i.e., the Axcend Focus
LC, and to provide ideas to best market the instrument to businesses involved in DOA treatment. From I-Corps
instructor suggestions and the many interviews that will be conducted, we expect to identify the most fruitful
markets to address as well as specific modifications to the product that can be made at this stage of its
development to make it more suitable and attractive to the various markets. The I-Corps team and company in
general understand the value of the I-Corps program. We believe that participation in I-Corps is extremely
valuable, if not essential, for us to reach the marketing goals desired by us and expected by the SBIR grant
program. Financial support from the I-Corps program would greatly assist us in fulfilling the commitments of
participation. The I-Corps team members understand the commitment required to participate in this cohort and
are prepared to immerse themselves in the program."
10986907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preclinical research relies heavily on appropriate animal models to better understand human biology and to
test the safety and efficacy of new therapies. It is important that animal research cores continually strive to
optimize preclinical models, both from an animal welfare standpoint and to promote rigor and the translatability
of preclinical data.
Rodents are thought to represent around 97% of the vertebrate animals used in biomedical research in the US.
Guidelines in the US recommend housing laboratory rodents at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 26°C.
However, there a growing body of data indicating that housing temperatures in the low to mid-20°Cs
represents mild cold stress for rodents. Critically, compared to housing animals at thermoneutrality, sub-
thermoneutrality can fundamentally change rodent physiology to a degree that can impact disease
susceptibility and/or the efficacy of specific therapies. Accordingly, the utility and importantly the translational
value of preclinical rodent models is dependent on appropriate control of housing temperature.
The goal of this application is to acquire modern rodent housing cabinets that will advance research-related
operations within the animal core at Arkansas Children’s Research Institute by providing a cost and energy-
efficient means to breed, house, and study rodents at temperatures that promote the rigor and translatability of
resulting data."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive and chronic neurodegenerative brain disorder that affects
approximately 1 million people in the United States. Parkinson’s disease affects all racial and ethnic
populations; however, members of ethnic and racial minorities have been historically underrepresented in PD
research. This underrepresentation has biased basic understandings of a disease that is already known to be
highly heterogeneous in terms of clinical presentation and symptom progression. In particular, non-motor
symptoms experienced by people living with PD are markedly different between individuals, and not well
understood in minority populations. These disparities are consequential because timely treatment of non-motor
symptoms can improve quality of life and delay disability. Therefore, it is imperative that the PD community
broaden its inclusivity by better understanding race- and ethnicity-related disparities of non-motor symptoms in
PD. Our objective is to investigate how race and ethnicity influence the occurrence (Aim 1), treatment (Aim 2),
and burden (Aim 3) of non-motor symptoms among Black/African American and Latino versus White non-
Latino people living with PD. We will use data from the Fox Insight study and the TriNetX platform to address
our research objectives. The Fox Insight Study is a groundbreaking, decentralized, online study that has
successfully enrolled and followed hundreds of people with PD who are Black/African American or of Latino
ethnicity or origin, and thousands of White non-Latino people living with PD. The TriNetX platform is a
federated network of > 50 healthcare organizations sharing electronic health records data, and includes
thousands of patients living with PD who are of Black/African American race and Latino ethnicity. In Aim 1,
these data will be used to compare the occurrence of non-motor symptoms between historically
underrepresented racial and ethnic (Black/African American, Latino) populations versus more frequently
studied (White non-Latino) populations among people living with PD (Aim 1). Next, Aim 2 will compare
frequencies of pharmacologic treatment use for non-motor symptoms between historically underrepresented
racial and ethnic (Black/African American, Latino) populations versus more frequently studied (White non-
Latino) populations among people living with PD. Finally, Aim 3 will compare the most bothersome symptoms
between historically underrepresented racial and ethnic (Black/African American, Latino) populations versus
more frequently studied (White non-Latino) populations among people living with PD. At the conclusion of this
research project, the goal is to have reduced some of the disparities that exist around the current knowledge of
PD heterogeneity in underrepresented populations."

A collaborative, multidisciplinary research project is proposed to develop and validate an
innovative platform to study separate phage species and to study the interactions between
bacteriophages and their host bacteria. We will create a microfluidic capillary electrophoretic
(CE) platform to separate bacteriophage from complex microbiota while sorting them into
enriched fractions. This system will be used to culture, manipulate, image and characterize
phage electrophoretic behavior on a molecular level, and to study fundamental cellular
processes that occur during the interaction between the phage and microbial cells. The platform
supports direct injection and measurement of microphysiological cultures and infections and
supports direct analysis and imaging of phage, phage-host and host mixtures from complex
microbiota. This platform maintains viability of the organisms, sorts and enriches rare
populations from complex mixtures in order to study fundamental molecular processes by direct
measurement and identification of novel phage populations. The development of the proposed
phage platform will provide a new tool for the manipulation of other viral components of the
microbiota."

 Excessive complement activation causes many diseases especially hematologic diseases such as
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), in which patient
erythrocytes are attacked by activated complement, causing extravascular and intravascular hemolysis, thus
anemia, thrombosis, and other life-threatening complications. Several complement inhibitors have been
approved by the FDA for treating these disorders with limited success, thus there is still a clinical demand for
better complement-targeted therapeutics. In pilot studies, we have developed a novel nanobody-based
complement inhibitor and demonstrated its potential in treating complement-mediated hematologic diseases. In
this project, we will develop additional novel complement inhibitors and thoroughly characterize them (R61
Phase), then examine the lead candidate in preclinical models of PNH and AIHA for its treatment efficacies
and pharmacokinetics profiles (R33 Phase). This project, if successful, will identify a promising first-in-class
complement inhibitor for further clinical development into a much-needed new drug for patients with
complement-mediated diseases such as PNH and AIHA."
10996862,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 After decades of increasing production of and reliance upon plastic materials, six billion metric tons of
plastic waste has been deposited in our environment. Through environmental, commercial, and municipal
degradation processes all plastics are eventually fragmented into micro-nanometer scale plastic particles and
fibers known as micro-nanoplastics (MNPs). Consequently, MNPs have become a nearly ubiquitous
contaminant of our environment and food web, to the extent that concentrations of MNPs in meat, dairy,
seafood, and grains range from 10 to over 3,000 µg/mL. Yet little is known about the hazards of MNP ingestion
exposures. A major concern is the ability of ingested MNPs, demonstrated by a growing number of studies, to
reach the circulation and breach biological barriers to enter virtually any tissue. They have been found in
human blood (at up to 13 µg/mL), colectomy samples, and placenta, and a recent study in our lab showed that
MNPs ingested by pregnant rats reach the livers, hearts, lungs, kidneys, and brains of fetal pups within 24
hours. Yet the impacts of MNP ingestion on human health, including absorption, biodistribution, toxicity, and
inflammation remain unclear, constituting major knowledge gaps that impede any science-based risk
assessment of this emerging contaminant.
 To address these knowledge gaps, the proposed project, comprising three interconnected aims, will
assess toxicity, uptake, and biodistribution of environmentally relevant MNPs, and the roles of MNP properties
and intestinal inflammation in each. In Aim 1 we will develop and fully characterize 5 environmentally relevant
gold core – plastic shell MNPs of three major plastic polymers (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and
polystyrene). The pristine core-shell MNPs will be photo-aged to simulate decades of environmental
exposures. The Au cores will enable accurate quantification of MNPs in cells and tissues, and intracellular
localization in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2 we will use a triculture small intestinal epithelium model and an “intestine-
on-chip” (IOC) model with organoids from both healthy donors and donors with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) coupled with simulated digestions to determine the role of iMNP physicochemical properties in iMNP
toxicity, inflammation, uptake, and translocation, and the role of inflammation in iMNP uptake and toxicity.
Specific molecular inhibitors and siRNA silencing will also be used to determine the cellular mechanisms
involved in MNP translocation. In Aim 3 we will assess in vivo MNP uptake, toxicity, biodistribution, and the role
of inflammation in each, in healthy and IBD-susceptible intestinal Hnf4a knockout mice. These studies will
provide validation and translational assessment of in vitro approaches as well as detailed data on iMNP organ
and tissue biodistribution.
 The data generated from these studies will allow health risk assessors and policymakers to assess the
potential risks of iMNP exposures and provide the basis for future mechanistic and epidemiological studies."
10994032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our understanding of human vision is based almost exclusively on studies of experimental proxies for reality–
typically artificial two-dimensional (2D) pictures. Studying responses to artificial stimuli neglects the fact that
humans have evolved and developed in the real world (RW), and that our behavior and brain processes are
likely to reflect the important features of tangible objects and environments, including depth, tangibility, actability,
and multisensory processing. Yet little is known about how real objects are processed and represented in the
brain, and how such responses compare to artificial stimuli. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate
the mechanisms that are engaged during naturalistic vision. The objective of this application is to understand
how, and why RW stimuli, compared with proxies, influence behavior and brain responses. The central
hypothesis is that response patterns to RW stimuli will be qualitatively different than 2D/3D pictures; these
differences will unfold during development, and they will be causally linked with computations in dorsal cortex.
These format-related differences will manifest during perception because the statistics of naturalistic contexts
are likely to be captured during experience, and because real objects (but not artificial stimuli) are relevant for
spatial and multisensory processing, and for action. The rationale for the research is that studying richer stimuli,
like those encountered in everyday life, will fundamentally improve our understanding of human brain function,
and expand the generalizability and translational value of scientific knowledge to RW settings. The central
hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: (1) Determine how real stimuli modulate behavioral and neural
response patterns in adults, (2) Determine how real stimuli modulate neural response patterns during
development, and (3) Isolate the causal contribution of dorsal cortex to real object effects. The aims will be
examined using behavioral and fMRI studies with adults, and fMRI studies with children and neuropsychological
patients with perceptual deficits. The studies employ novel and innovative stimuli, devices, and procedures,
designed for presenting large numbers of real objects in rapid succession in the laboratory and the fMRI scanner,
under controlled viewing conditions. The contribution of the research is that it will elucidate the psychological
and neural systems that are engaged during naturalistic vision. This contribution is significant because it will
reveal how the integrated workings of the perception-action systems shapes visual cognition, why these systems
should be studied with RW stimuli, and how their activity influences and improves performance."
10987696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Neural circuit assembly requires activity-dependent refinement of circuit architecture (e.g.
plasticity) to produce stereotyped behavior. Neurons are particularly susceptible to functional and structural
plasticity during early developmental windows called critical periods. Failure to terminate critical period plasticity
adversely affects mature circuit function in both animal models and humans (e.g. autism and epilepsy), yet the
mechanisms that close critical periods are largely unknown. This Pathway to Independence Award proposal
seeks to define conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote critical period closure, and to
understand how critical periods shape circuit architecture to ensure proper locomotor behavior.
Project Goals: We will leverage the unique strengths of two model systems- Drosophila and zebrafish- to define
the cellular and molecular mechanisms that instruct neural plasticity. Specifically, we will determine how
astrocyte-neuron signaling governs critical period timing, and how changes in critical period timing influence
long-term circuit structure and function. First, we will test how microtubule stability influences motor dendrite
structure to test how structural plasticity is executed (Aim 1). Then, we will test how critical period plasticity
influences motor circuit maintenance to determine why structural plasticity is temporally restricted (Aim 2).
Finally, we will use zebrafish to determine how astrocytes regulate plasticity in distinct neural circuits with
different patterns of plasticity (Aim 3).
Candidate and environment: Dr. Ackerman was trained in molecular genetics and developmental neuroscience
in the laboratory of Dr. Kelly Monk at WashU School of Medicine, where she used forward and reverse genetic
strategies to uncover regulators of myelination (NS087801). She then joined the laboratory of the renowned
neurobiologist Dr. Chris Doe (UO, HHMI/NAS). There, she defined a novel critical period of plasticity in the
developing Drosophila motor circuit and uncovered a series of astrocyte-derived molecular regulators of critical
period closure (NS098690). Dr. Ackerman has chosen to open her laboratory within the Center for Brain
Immunology and Glia at WashU (Department of Pathology and Immunology). The Center brings together faculty
and physicians across multiple departments to understand how non-neuronal cells shape nervous system
development, function, and disease. With the support of the Center and pre-existing mentors at WashU (Dr. Jim
Skeath, Dr. Lila Solnica-Krezel, Dr. Aaron Diantonio, and others), she and her team are well-equipped to uncover
how neuron-glia interactions regulate developmental plasticity."

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have resulted in the generation of vast
quantities of publicly accessible data that are specific to cancer. This wealth of information has significantly
enhanced our comprehension of disease mechanisms. It is now evident that alterations in epigenetic and
genetic factors can disrupt the interactions between regulatory elements and their target genes, leading to
abnormal gene regulation. Numerous studies conducted on distinct cancer types have yielded promising
outcomes, unveiling previously unknown cancer subtypes characterized by distinctive enhancer landscapes.
Moreover, these studies have identified clinically relevant regulatory elements that have implications for
prognosis and treatment. Nevertheless, the majority of cancer analyses tend to concentrate on specific cancer
subtypes and fail to capitalize on the entire breadth of available data encompassing both tumorigenic and
normal tissue and cell types.
As members of the ENCODE project, we have created the Registry of candidate cis-Regulatory Elements, an
extensive compilation of nearly one million potential enhancers, promoters, and insulators in the human
genome. These elements have been characterized across over 800 human cell types, offering valuable
insights into non-coding regions. However, it's important to note that the Registry lacks clinical data, and all
experimental findings were obtained from healthy individuals, which limits its applicability in cancer research.
To address this limitation, we propose the development of a regulatory-element–target-gene atlas, which will
enable researchers to explore the connections between regulatory elements and genes associated with cancer
(Aim 1). Drawing upon our expertise in regulatory genomics and three-dimensional chromatin architecture, we
will perform extensive analysis to identify germline variants, somatic mutations, and other genetic aberrations
that affect cCREs and predict their effects on molecular phenotypes (Aim 2). Finally, to enhance accessibility
to these tools, we will establish a new cloud-based computational notebook-based environment equipped with
modular and customizable components for integrative data visualization. This environment will be flexible and
user-friendly, allowing researchers to easily access and utilize cancer-specific genomic data (Aim 3). Finally,
we will collaborate with ITCR members and perform community outreach (Aim 4).Together, these tools will
simplify and improve the accessibility of cancer-specific genomic data."

We propose to iden0fy an op0mal smoking cessa0on drug candidate by monitoring how our newly synthesized
varenicline prodrugs alter real-0me brain dopamine responses to nico0ne. Varenicline (CHANTIX®) is currently the
leading FDA-approved oral medica0on for smoking cessa0on. However, only 22% of pa0ents maintain abs0nence for 52
weeks aNer varenicline treatment. Addi0onally, more than 67% of pa0ents prematurely discon0nue treatment,
indica0ng a need for therapies that improve pa0ent compliance. To address this, we have developed extended-release
prodrugs that aim to enhance the pharmacokine0c proper0es of varenicline. Varenicline works by reducing nico0ne
craving and use by increasing dopamine levels transiently and then blocking the dopamine response to nico0ne. These
changes stabilize dopamine signaling in the brain, reducing the side eﬀects of temporary dopamine increases and
prolonging the drug's ability to reduce the reward value of nico0ne.
In our STTR Phase I grant, we will use an in vivo dopamine biosensor to evaluate real-0me dopamine levels in the
striatum aNer administering our novel prodrugs. We will establish a rela0onship between brain eﬃcacy and drug levels in
vivo. These studies will allow us to screen for prodrugs that have op0mal eﬃcacy in altering both the level and dura0on
of dopamine response, which serves as a biomarker for predic0ng the eﬀec0veness of smoking cessa0on drugs. Our
ini0al pilot data show that, compared to varenicline, our prodrugs posi0vely alter the dopamine release proﬁle in the
striatum.
As the developers of a novel drug for smoking cessa0on, we are seeking mentorship to gain a beZer understanding of
the market forces that will determine the success or failure of our approach to this signiﬁcant health challenge. The I-
Corps™ program will guide and enable us to reach out to relevant stakeholders, such as prospec0ve pa0ents, physicians,
insurers, regulators, and pharmaceu0cal companies. Through this eﬀort, we aim to iden0fy the unique value proposi0on
that sets our product apart from exis0ng solu0ons and use this knowledge to develop a robust strategy for our
commercializa0on plan in a subsequent SBIR Phase 2 grant."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million
people worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable
progression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to
understand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA
damage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial
DNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising
bioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies
by the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and
promote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that
ATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair
capacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. The
overarching goal of the parental grant to understand how dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA
damage response pathway, which impairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in
mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately promoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. Specific to this
research supplement, we have discovered PARP is playing an important role in PD. Based on this data, Ivana
Barraza will investigate PARP1 in mitochondrial function. She will learn new technical expertise and
methodology, publish impactful research and obtain the key preliminary data for competitive T grants to launch
a successful scientific career. Overall this project will directly complement the parental grant and ongoing
experiments in the lab to understand shared pathways that drive mitochondrial dysfunction, in order to provide
new insights into PD pathophysiology and consequently lead to new therapies."

 Overdose deaths are exponentially rising for Black individuals compared to White, where over 50% of
overdose fatalities are associated with polysubstance use. Polysubstance use is a common method of use
among Black young adults, placing them at a greater level of risk for mortality. Racism is a social determinant of
substance use for Black populations and may in part explain some of the observed disparities. Racism is
commonly operationalized and measured as racial discrimination. Racial discrimination measured at its various
levels (i.e., institutional (overt), interpersonal (covert), and internalized) have each been positively associated
with increased substance use. The impact of racial discrimination has been narrowly defined, only accounting
for present-day experiences, and omits the influence of intergenerational, historical influences of racism, or
historical trauma. Historical trauma is conceptualized as losses due to racial and ethnic cleansing, oppression,
and colonization and has been linked to increased substance use among Indigenous youth. Historical trauma
may also serve as an explanation for increased polysubstance use in Black young adults by understanding the
increased vulnerability to racist-related events both present and past. Beyond the strong evidence of the co-
occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD), there is also evidence
that racism-based stressors, like racial discrimination, are also associated with elevated PTSD symptoms among
Black young adults, but little is known about the interplay with historical trauma.
 This cross-sectional, quantitative study is unique and novel, as it aims to measure the impact of racism-
related experiences (major discriminatory events (overt), racial microaggressions (covert), internalized racism,
and historical trauma) more comprehensively on PTSD symptoms and polysubstance use among Black young
adults (N = 300), while also psychometrically testing the properties of the adapted Historical Loss Scale. It is
hypothesized that increases in present-day racism-based experiences will be positively related to increased
polysubstance use through PTSD symptoms. Second, the association between present-day racial discrimination
and PTSD symptoms will be moderated by levels of historical trauma. Ultimately, it is hypothesized that the
subjective response to racism-based events may be more pronounced among participants who endorse greater
experiences of historical trauma. The psychometric evaluation will be conducted using confirmatory factor
analysis and testing the associations between historical trauma and psychological symptoms (complex trauma
symptoms, PTSD symptoms, rumination, grief, and anger) to measure construct reliability.
 This study revolutionizes the conceptualization of racism as a social determinant of substance use by
including both present-day and historical influences, while focusing on a specific form of substance use,
polysubstance use, that increases risk for fatal overdose. Results from this project can help inform prevention
and intervention efforts targeting at reducing polysubstance use from a culturally sensitive lens."

Racial and ethnic health inequities persist despite decades of evidence showing how societal structures drove
their development. Quality improvement (QI Initiatives, seemingly intended to promote equity, have great
potential to exacerbate disparities if there is not intentional focus on benefitting the population(s) experiencing
inequity. Attempts at equity-focused QI have underperformed by 1) focusing on improvement for all, rather than
on erasing disparities, 2) deploying a top-down stakeholder approach, rather than a community-informed
approach, 3) lacking a framework for considering quality measures through the contexts of systemic racism,
and 4) prioritizing ease of measurement over measures that are a priority to patients and communities. Recent
calls have been made for QI interventions that leverage partnerships between communities experiencing
inequities, providers serving these populations, and QI researchers to reduce health care disparities using
outcome measures that measure quality in ways meaningful to all stakeholders. Data and technology can be
harnessed to improve health equity by stratifying electronic health record (EHR) data by race, ethnicity, and
language (REaL) to create equity-focused QI dashboards to identify inequitable patterns in clinical processes
and health outcomes and inform QI initiatives to reverse them. However, if dashboard metrics and the
interventions to address them are not cooperatively designed by patients and providers, this limits their
influence and effectiveness. The study proposed within this K-Award is intended to be a first step in a larger
program of research that will serve to bridge health inequities research with medical informatics tools at the
intersection of Quality Improvement and Implementation Science, by 1) Identifying healthcare quality measures
using a community-informed, equity-focused approach, 2) Incorporate community-informed healthcare quality
measures into QI dashboards, and 3) using community-engaged intervention mapping to design strategies to
decrease health inequity. Equity-focused dashboards will provide concrete, real-time data to both inform
strategies and measure improvement, whether they be advanced structural competency training for providers,
changes to clinic policy and workflow, or interventions to address unmet social needs. This career
development award is designed to provide critical training in the fundamentals of quality improvement,
implementation science, community-engaged intervention design, and medical informatics that are necessary
for developing community-informed, practical, and measurable approaches to decrease racial health inequities
in primary care populations. This K01 will facilitate the development of patient-informed quality indicators and
innovative implementation strategies to improve health equity in primary care. The proposed study is
responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice for Health Services Research to Advance Health Equity

10990326,"Project Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a high body-mas index (BMI) have poor efficacy to chemotherapy, creating
an urgent need to design targeted therapy for this group of cancer patients. During obesity, the excess visceral
adipose tissue (AT) deposited around major organs in the abdomen triggers systemic metabolic dysregulation
and creates an environment conducive to cancer development, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). Obese AT
secretes more extracellular vesicles (EVs) compared to non-obese AT, which can be taken up by distant tissues.
EVs are lipid-membraned vesicles that carry cargo from the parent cell and are important for inter-organ
communication. Unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that obese EVs (OB-EVs) and non-obese (N-OB) EVs
are distinctly different in terms of their cargo, with an enrichment of the glycolytic enzyme triose phosphate
isomerase 1 (TPI1) in OB-EVs. Consequently, OB-EV treatment of CRC cells resulted in higher TPI1 levels
compared to N-OB EV treatment. Functionally, OB-EVs increased basal glycolysis of human and mouse CRC
cells and enhanced the ability of CRC cells to form 3D tumoroids and spheroids. CRC cells can aberrantly
increase glycolysis to support tumor growth and aggressive, however, it is not known whether these pro-
tumorigenic effects can get enhanced during obesity.
 In the F99 portion of this grant, I will determine if the cargo from AT-derived EVs is utilized by CRC cells
to change their metabolism and promote a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, and whether it is enhanced during obesity.
I will use a novel mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis lacking EV secretion from adipocytes that will be
challenged with obesity to elucidate the role of OB-EV cargo in CRC development. The goals of this project are
to 1) confirm whether OB-EVs transfer TPI1 to CRC cells and its regulation on glycolysis and 2) determine the
oncogenic role of OB-EV and TPI1 in CRC development in vivo. The results from this study will help advance
the field of EV biology in cancer during obesity and identify potential targets for cancer therapeutics in obese
CRC patients.
 In the K00 portion of this grant, I will expand on elucidating the impact of AT-derived EVs on the immune
population of CRC TME. Obese CRC TME is known to be immunosuppressive with increased infiltration of M2-
like macrophages. However, there is a lack of studies enumerating the underlying molecular players mediating
the observed phenotype. Therefore, I propose to determine whether OB-EVs reprogram macrophages in the
obese TME to an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype to promote tumor progression. I will seek K00 labs with
comprehensive expertise on tumor immunology and associated signaling pathway to provide me with the training
I require to complete my project and characterize the impact of obesity in CRC TME."
10990327,"Project Summary:
Maternal obesity with increased circulating inflammatory markers can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such
as preeclampsia (PE). Clinical signs of PE include maternal hypertension and proteinuria during the second half
of gestation. Importantly, maternal hypertension only resolves after delivery of the placenta and the fetus, which
is often preterm. The etiology of this is unknown. It is our hypothesis that the maternal gut microbiome as a result
of hyperphagia contributes to heightened inflammation and subsequent abnormal fetoplacental development.
The overarching goal of these proposed studies is to test the hypothesis that maternal hyperphagia-induced
obesity and gut dysbiosis in PE leads to altered short chain fatty acids (SCFA) signaling through embryonic free
fatty acid receptor, GPR43. This in turn contributes to aberrant in utero fetal programming and cardiometabolic
disease. We will test our hypothesis in the BPH/5 mouse model of superimposed PE combining novel in vivo
and ex vivo experiments. In Aim 1, we will determine if the maternal gut microbiome milieu contributes to pro-
inflammatory and/or anti-inflammatory SCFA signaling at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy. Also, if
oral supplementation with Lactobacillus (LB) improves PE outcomes in mice with spontaneous PE. NFΚB factors
will be measured in BPH/5+LB and BPH/5 mice depleted of LB. In Aim 2, we will embryo transfer to ascertain
the maternal versus embryonic contribution to SCFA signaling. BPH/5+LB and -LB, and Gpr43-/- embryos will
be transferred to high and low acetate dams. In Aim 3, offspring outcomes will be assessed to determine whether
reversal of maternal obesity via pair-feeding and/or LB+ prevents aberrant fetal cardiac angiogenesis and adult
onset cardiometabolic dysfunction. These experiments will combine the gold standard radiotelemetric blood
pressure recording with metabolic cages to measure cardiometabolic fitness in offspring when maternal gut
dysbiosis is reversed and PE signs are attenuated. These findings will provide groundbreaking prenatal
mechanisms to prevent adult-onset cardiometabolic disease, hypertension, in PE born offspring."
10990336,"ABSTRACT - The focus of this proposal is on lethal, metastatic prostate cancer (PC). The aim of this study
is to develop an innovative, minimally invasive, liquid biopsy assay that can be used to identify molecular
subtypes of lethal prostate cancer PC in patients with a biologically aggressive disease. Phenotyping Large
Oncosomes for Ultimate Evaluation of Patients Status (PLUS) will identify biomarkers of short/long response to
treatment, and progressively assess tumor phenotype during PC evolution and under treatment pressure. We
propose to focus on extracellular vesicles (EV) known as large oncosomes (LO) that are identified in the plasma
of patients with aggressive cancer. Using gold standard methods, we obtained pure populations of LO and
performed extensive mass spectrometry and NGS experiments that identified a set of proteins and RNA markers
that have been validated by multiple experiments in vitro and in a few pilot patient cohorts, as explained in
preliminary results. In this application, we will employ innovative technologies to translate our efforts to define
LO-based signatures to the CLIA laboratory to determine clinical utility of our liquid biopsy approach in PC
patients with lethal disease, both in the castration resistant and hormone sensitive space. We will leverage an
expansive cohort of clinically annotated PC specimens (N=600), both retrospectively and prospectively collected
from 2 independent sites. In Aim 1, we will perform analytical validation of LO isolation technologies for clinical
use. In Aim 2, we will develop an LO-centered multianalyte assay to detect lethal PC and predict ARSI response.
In Aim 3 we will assess the sensitivity and specificity of PLUS in metastatic hormone-sensitive PC patients to
predict lethal outcomes. We will continue to focus on PC because of the significance of PC open clinical
questions, of the challenges relative to this tumor-type in liquid biopsy development, and our extensive
experience in the field of PC molecular landscape. Yet, there is great opportunity for our LO-based assay to be
expanded to other tumor types in the future. Our study is technologically innovative and will likely result in the
identification of new markers and ultimately in the application of a microfluidic device to the CLIA lab. The M-PI
team brings expertise not only on EVs (Di Vizio, Stott, Demichelis), but also on ctDNA (Demichelis) and CTCs
(Stott) and propose orthogonal approaches to determine which method, among bead-based and microfluidic
capture, which will be benchmarked against density gradients, has the best performance in a complex clinical
lab."
10990364,"Language ability is a strong and consistent predictor of outcomes for individuals on the autism spectrum (ASD).
ConsequenUy, understanding key predictors and mechanisms underlying positive early language development,
and alterations thereof across the variability in language development in autism, is paramount for optimizing the
design, targets, and timing of interventions. In typically developing (TD) and autistic infants, beginning in the
second half of the first year of life and continuing into the second year, infants shift their preferential attention
from a speaker's eyes to their mouth. Increased visual attention to the mouth during infant-directed speech during
this stage is associated with language development in TD infants, likely because shifting attention to a speaker's
mouth enables infants to take advantage of visual cues that complement the auditory speech signal. Multi modal
signals, such as the integrated face and voice of an engaging caregiver, draw attention to and facilitate
processing of features that occur across modalities. This is especially beneficial when processing is difficult,
suggesting that attention to the mouth should be particularly relevant during initial stages of language acquisition
in TD, as well as for children with communication challenges, including autism. We recenUy demonstrated that
the naturally increased multi modality of infant-directed singing relative to speech potentiated TD infants' attention
to the mouth of an engaging caregiver, with differential cues (e.g., rhythmic predictability, tempo, audiovisual
synchrony, affect) driving mouth-looking at different developmental stages; we extended these findings to ASD
in pilot data for the current project. As well, our team demonstrated that the adaptive value of mouth-looking for
expressive language in autism is moderated by children's expressive language level. Building on these findings,
the current project leverages the continuum of multimodal cues across infant-directed speech and song to
investigate links across visual attention (especially mouth-looking), differential multimodal cue sensitivity, and
expressive language in TD and autism. We harness a large existing dataset of well-characterized TD and autistic
infants (Aim 1a), as well as infants at increased family likelihood for autism with varied outcomes (Aim 1b},
followed prospectively over the first two years of life, to quantify differential trajectories of mouth-looking during
speech and song in relationship with expressive language outcomes. We combine this with new cross-sectional
data collection in well-characterized cohorts of TD, autistic, and non-autistic expressive language delay (ELD)
children to determine how communicative contexts (song, speech; Aim 2) and sensitivity to specific multi modal
cues (Aim 3) drive mouth-looking and are adaptive for expressive language skills across different diagnoses and
expressive language levels. This research will identify basic mechanisms by which multimodal cues support
language development in specific populations, actionable targets for language intervention using diverse forms
of ecologically-valid infant-directed communication, and developmental windows of opportunity for intervention
development and delivery for autistic children."
10996937,"Project Summary/Abstract
Osteoclasts are the cells in the body responsible for bone resorption. Osteoclasts in the
craniofacial region participate in several skeletal site-specific processes that involve bone
resorption such as tooth eruption and orthodontic tooth movement. Much of what is known about
the activity of craniofacial osteoclasts in current literature is based on our understanding of
osteoclasts derived from the appendicular skeleton and long bones such as the femur. This
proposal aims to further elucidate the unique characteristics that exist between the osteoclasts
derived from the mandibular and the femur bone marrow. Evidence shows that these two
populations of osteoclasts are different, but the conclusions drawn about these differences are
unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify unique cell clusters present within mandible
derived marrow cells as compared to long bone-derived bone marrow I have determined that
mandible derived monocytes have decreased expression of genes involved in proliferation but an
increase in inflammatory gene expression. Bulk RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq of monocytes from the
mandible and femur derived cells will be used to further determine changes in chromatin
accessibility (Aim1). Additionally, siRNA knockdown experiments will further explore the impact
of key genes identified by single-cell sequencing on osteoclast development. In addition to a lack
of mechanism for the existent differences between mandibular and long bone derived osteoclasts,
it is also unknown which osteoclast precursors are recruited to the site of injury during bone
healing in the mandible. Proposed experiments will work to determine if CX3CR1+ cells contribute
to mandible bone repair. It will be investigated if embryonic circulating and/or adult myeloid
precursors, defined by expression of the CX3CR1 or Vav1-reporters respectively, provide
osteoclasts within the mandible following a single cortex bone injury (Aim 2). Concurrently, this
work will further the understanding of osteoclasts role in craniofacial site-specific processes as
well as inform the future development of improved healing and regenerative treatments in the
craniofacial region. These research goals will be enriched by the training goals of this application.
The training goals of this application include learning techniques such as single cell RNA
sequencing analysis, bulk RNA sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, as well as mouse husbandry and
micro-computed tomography at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry."
10995184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of a functional central nervous system is dependent upon the proper specification of distinct
cell fates by multipotent progenitor cells. While the role of protein-coding genes in this process is well studied,
there is a pressing need to understand how non-coding elements, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and
enhancers, contribute to cell fate decisions as a growing number of studies implicate non-coding genomic
elements in disease. The long term goal of this project is to elucidate how the microRNA, miR9-2 regulates the
timing of cell fate specification during retinal development. miR9-2, along with its distal enhancer, has been
linked to retinal disease and associated phenotypes, and disruption of miR9-2, through deletion of its
enhancer, can delay the emergence of late-born cell classes. Therefore, the hypothesis of this proposal is that
miR9-2, in coordination with its enhancer, regulates specific target transcripts in progenitor cells to control the
timing of neurogenesis during retinal development. Here, using in vivo mouse models, single-cell sequencing,
and machine-learning directed enhancer bashing approaches, this proposal will dissect the functional role of
miR9-2 and its enhancer to understand the regulatory role they play in proper specification of retinal cell
classes. The proposed research is significant, because it will provide a comprehensive understanding of the
enhancer-miR9-2 regulatory unit and the gene networks, cell classes, and retinal structures under its control.
This will further provide an opportunity to model the mechanisms of action by which non-coding elements
influence the development and diseases of the central nervous system and may lead to gene targets and
pathways with therapeutic potential."
10995251,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall objective of this K43 Emerging Global Leader Award is to support Dr. Jonathan Izudi’s transition to
independence as an implementation scientist focused on improving tuberculosis (TB)/HIV care. Dr. Izudi's long-
term goal is to reduce the TB burden among people living with HIV (PLHIV) by tackling barriers to successful
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment using context-relevant interventions delivered through person-centered
strategies. The overall objective of this K43 grant application is to develop and pilot an implementation strategy
focused on integrating TB treatment into community pharmacies among people with TB/HIV in Uganda. People
with TB/HIV have sub-optimal treatment outcomes, with the pooled treatment success rate averaging 70-71%,
far below the World Health Organization's desired target of ≥90%. Compared to people who do not have HIV,
treatment success is 35-47% lower and the risk of developing multi-drug resistant TB is 24% higher. Community
pharmacies are a proven differentiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) service delivery model that has been
successful in moving ART from central health facilities to the community. In doing so, ART access, coverage,
and adherence are improved because medication pick-ups are more convenient, inadvertent HIV status
disclosure and community stigma are prevented, and health workers can focus on people with adherence
challenges. Community pharmacies present a potential to provide similar benefits to people with TB/HIV through
offering TB medication refills. Dr. Izudi hypothesizes that a theory-informed, context-relevant strategy for
integrating TB treatment into community pharmacies adapted to the needs of people with TB/HIV and health
workers will improve TB treatment success. To test the central hypothesis, Dr. Izudi proposed three specific
aims: Aim 1) to explore the barriers and facilitators to integrating TB treatment into community pharmacies
among people with TB/HIV; Aim 2) to adapt a person-centered strategy for integrating TB treatment into
community pharmacies using human-centered design methodology; and, Aim 3) to evaluate the implementation
outcomes (feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability) and preliminary effectiveness of integrating TB treatment into
community pharmacies among people with TB/HIV. Completion of the aims will provide the preliminary data to
support Dr. Izudi's application for an R01 proposing a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the implementation
and effectiveness of integrating TB treatment into community pharmacies at the national level. In addition,
conducting the proposed studies will enable Dr. Izudi to achieve four training goals: 1) To acquire advanced skills
in qualitative and mixed methods research; 2) To gain skills and competence in implementation science research
enabling the sound use of theories, models, and frameworks; 3) To gain expertise in interventional studies in
implementation science research; and 4) To gain expertise in grantsmanship for transition to a successful
research career. The proposed studies will enable Dr. Izudi to complement his skillset in public health and
epidemiology with advanced skills in socio-behavioral research, implementation science, and interventional
studies through specific training and tailored mentorship."
10993877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading cause of male cancer-related deaths. Once disseminated PC is incurable as it
gradually progresses to all therapeutic options. The mechanisms underlying aggressive features and lethality of
metastatic PC remain an unmet clinical need. We and others have reported that metastatic PC displays the
highest levels of chromosomal instability (CIN), and we have shown that transcriptional reprogramming allows
PC CIN-adaptation and survival in advanced disease. Yet, the molecular underpinnings of CIN impact on PC
remain poorly understood. Using genetic, proteomic, epigenomics and high-resolution microscopy, we found that
CIN is linked to transcriptional rewiring and bookmarking suggesting a role of CIN in cell reprogramming in lethal
PC. High CIN PC remains highly dependent on mitotic fidelity programs like the ones controlled by MASTL kinase
to restrain lethal catastrophic CIN levels. We find that MASTL regulates new late mitotic processes involved in
centrosome biology and cytokinesis in PC cells. However, the substrates and effectors by which MASTL regulate
these functions remain unknown. Finally, our in vivo data strongly suggest a relevant role of CIN impacting anti-
tumor immunity in PC. In this application we will use unique genetic models to identify the substrates and
cofactors by which MASTL kinase regulates new functions in high CIN PC (Aim 1). We will investigate the
molecules and mechanisms underlying CIN-induced transcriptional reprogramming and gene bookmarking in
PC (Aim 2) and will explore the tumor immune cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms triggered by CIN in PC
that may enhance immunotherapy efficacy (Aim 3). Through these studies we will mechanistically uncover novel
aspects of CIN consequences for PC and may identify new potential treatment strategies for this lethal disease."

research for adolescents and young adults in low- and middle-income countries. We will offer a 5-day co-
created D&I course focused on key concepts such as adaptation, scale-up, and sustainability for eight early
career researchers and implementers or practitioners as part of the annual PATC3H-IN meeting held with
participating Clinical Research Centers. We will also organize a 3-day designathon (similar to hackathons),
where participants prepare with end-users, intensively collaborate (often 48-72 hours), and then implement
solutions in local areas. Scholars and implementers will share lessons learned, lead the design, and launch of
emerging research pilots funded by the PATC3H-IN network as well as competitive seed grants (n=10)
sponsored by the INSPIRE Capacity Supporting Core to promote the adaptation, scale-up, or sustainability of

Advanced Methods and Modeling Core (AMMC) to lead the emerging research pilots' program with PATC3H-
IN Coordinating Operating Center on emerging methods (i.e., preferences, agent-based modeling, costing) for
adapting, scaling-up and sustaining evidence-based research. To enhance AYA engagement in community-
engaged research and dissemination with other non-academic partners, we will partner with the INSPIRE
Community Engagement and Dissemination Core to conduct the annual team-based designathons focused on
adapting, scaling up, or sustaining evidence-based HIV research for AYA. Our overall goals are to foster
research and capacity support to accelerate the adaptation, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based

10994265,"Research Summary:
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common histologic subtype of ovarian cancer.
Despite ongoing efforts to develop effective surgical and treatment regimens for advanced HGSOC, the overall
survival rate is only 30%, in part due to late diagnosis. HGSOC is among the most chemo-sensitive of all
epithelial malignancies at diagnosis. However, a subset of advanced stage patients fails to respond to initial
therapy and has a dismal prognosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms through which HGSOC
metastasizes, and develops intrinsic chemoresistance is crucial to improve the efficacy of treatments and
survival of patients. The proposed Ovarian Cancer Atlas Research Center (OCARC) will use and integrate
multiple state-of-the-art molecular and cellular profiling platforms to construct a three-dimensional (3D) ovarian
cancer atlas characterizing HGSOC metastasis, and the development of intrinsic therapeutic resistance using
a diverse patient cohort diagnosed with advanced HGSOC. The Center is composed of an Administrative Core
and three connected units: a Biospecimen Unit, a Characterization Unit, and a Data Processing Unit. The
multi-PI team from MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the University of Arkansas, brings together
internationally recognized experts in ovarian cancer biology and treatment, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics,
and imaging. This team will have the complementary multidisciplinary scientific expertise required for the
integration of the multidimensional, multiparametric data needed to construct a 3D ovarian cancer atlas and
address the key research problems proposed. The Administrative Core will provide the support necessary for
the proposed OCARC infrastructure. The Biospecimen Unit will acquire specimens, collect clinicopathologic
information, and prepare tissue sections. The Characterization Unit will perform spatially resolved subcellular
transcriptome profiling on FFPE tissue sections using the novel STOmics platform; 3D metabolomic and
peptidomic and glycomic profiling using high-resolution mass spectrometry imaging; and 3D stromal and tumor
cell profiling using the COMET multiplex immunofluorecence platform. The Data Processing Unit will build a
data warehouse hosting all the data generated by the Characterization Unit and the Biospecimen Unit. It will be
responsible for integrating all available data to identify the key signaling circuits that underlie the 3D spatial
changes of phenotypic profiles. The final atlas will identify differences in the cellular and molecular content, and
cell-cell crosstalk signaling networks in HGSOCs from (1) primary and metastatic sites; and (2) intrinsic
chemosensitive and chemoresistant HGSOCs. It will bring deeper insight into the multidimensional HGSOC
tumor ecosystems associated with intrinsic chemoresistance. We expect that our results will be used by
academic researchers, clinical researchers, and industry partners to improve our understanding of the
molecular basis of ovarian cancer and better stratify disease management and improve patient outcome. Our
results will have the potential to lead to the development of novel agents against chemoresistant HGSOC."
10994381,"As humans age it is common to lose afferent synapses between hair cells and auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs),
known as cochlear synaptopathy (CS). While some studies have found that CS produces an associated
impairment in the perception of complex sounds in noise (i.e., hidden hearing loss; HHL), others have seen no
effect. Greater clarity into HHL requires a knowledge of CS effects on neural encoding in surviving ANFs, but
these remain controversial due to few existing studies and conflicting results across investigations. Therefore,
the first aim of the current study is to quantify the effects of CS on ANF response properties in a new animal
model, the budgerigar (parakeet). One strength of using the budgerigar is their ability to hear the lower
frequencies humans rely on for speech comprehension. Furthermore, the budgerigar is widely used in
behavioral auditory research, including ongoing behavioral studies of CS in our lab, and shows performance
comparable to humans for various complex auditory-discrimination tasks. Intracochlear infusions of 1-mM
kainic acid, a glutamate analog, are performed to produce substantial ANF loss while sparing hair cells. We
hypothesize that ANF responses in normal-hearing budgerigars will be fundamentally similar to other avians
and mammals, including the dynamic range of rate-level functions, threshold distribution pattern, and similar
tuning curves. Differences of interest include the number of ribbons per synapse, which could influence the
statistics of spontaneous activity and the shape of rate-level functions. We hypothesize that CS will increase
onset synchrony of single-fiber responses, based on recent discoveries in mouse and gerbil pointing to altered
temporal dynamics of hair-cell ribbon synapses. We expect no other major changes with CS in other ANF
response properties (e.g., dynamic range). Histological studies will test for synaptic changes. The second aim
of the study is to develop tools for detecting CS. Despite its prevalence in humans, there are no sufficient non-
invasive tools to detect CS. The envelope-following response (EFR) is a scalp potential evoked with amplitude-
modulated stimuli, that may be more sensitive to CS in humans due to its relatively high amplitude. EFRs are
typically measured using sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones, but a recent modeling study suggests
that square-wave modulated (SWM) tones might provide more synchronous ANF responses and therefore may
be more sensitive to detect CS. Hence, the current study will probe EFRs to SAM and SWM tones in animals
before and after inducing CS. Preliminary data in the budgerigar demonstrate that EFRs evoked by SWM
stimuli provide a stronger indication of histologically validated ANF damage in CS budgerigars than SAM
EFRs. Finally, ANF responses to SAM and SWM tones will be recorded in control and CS ears to test for the
hypothesized increase in synchrony to the modulation frequency for SWM tones (expected in both groups).
Ultimately, the proposed experiments will characterize changes in ANF response properties following CS and
develop non-invasive methods for this common cochlear pathology."
10978992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amplification of the oncogene MYCN drives high-risk progressive disease, resistance to therapy, and a poor
overall survival rate below 45% for high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) patients. Further, more than half of all high-risk
patients will relapse, and the post-relapse survival rate is only 10%. MYCN-driven NB tumors have poor immune
responses due to a relatively low mutational load, low MHC-I expression, and reduced immune cell infiltration.
As a result, NB is often immunologically quiescent, thus limiting immunotherapy approaches. MYCN amplification
has a central role in orchestrating the metabolic reprogramming that favors NB growth and adaptation to its
microenvironment. Tumor cells and immune cells exist in a complex environment where they share and compete
for specific nutrients. Through unbiased transcriptomics, metabolomics, and immune profiling of TH-MYCN GEM
and syngeneic mouse models of NB, we have identified cysteine metabolism as a selective vulnerability in
MYCN-driven NB. We have also found that MYCN drives an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment
(TME) during oncogenesis, and reprograms NB tumors to create a cysteine-poor TME. By lacking de novo
biosynthetic enzymes, T cells are exquisitely vulnerable to cysteine starvation, while cysteine supplementation
restores T-cell activation, expansion, and effector functions. Our central hypothesis is that MYCN-driven tumor
intrinsic metabolism and recruitment of other cysteine-consuming cells (such as PMN-MDSCs) deplete
extracellular cysteine, thus blocking T cell anti-tumor activity. This proposal aims to: (1) elucidate how oncogenic
MYCN rewires the metabolic environment of NB to drive immune suppression; and (2) modulate the metabolic
environment of NB to enhance immune-based approaches for high-risk MYCN-amplified disease."
10978903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immunotherapy holds the promise of a cure for cancer. However, only a subset (<20%) of patients
exhibit durable response to immunotherapy. This is because immune checkpoint inhibitors need
immune cells in the tumor. However, many tumors are found to be immunologically barren or cold,
i.e. lack tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Overcoming this barrier is key to a cure for cancer.
We recently discovered that cancer cells form physical nanoscale tentacles (tunneling nanotubes)
to connect with and harvest mitochondria from immune cells, which depletes the immune cells.
Recent evidence show mitochondria-harvesting tumors have poor clinical outcomes. There is is
an unmet need to target this novel mechanism of immune evasion. There are two distinct and
complementary strategies to achieve this goal: (1) Engineer CAR-Ts or TILS with extra
mitochondria (augmented T cells) such that any loss of mitochondria to cancer cells doesn’t not
fully deplete the immune cells of their metabolic capacity; and (2) Disable the ability of a cancer
cell to form nanotubes to harvest immune cell mitochondria. In this proposal, we aim to develop
an immunotherapeutic regimen that combines these two strategies with an immune checkpoint
inhibition. Specifically, We will evaluate different organelle transplantation technologies for
delivering mitochondria, a nanoscale structure, to a T cell ex vivo prior to infusion as cell therapy
(Aim 1); (2) Test the antitumor efficacy of these mitochondria-augmented T cells in combination
with a drug that inhibits the capability of cancer cells to form nanotubes and an immune checkpoint
inhibitor (Aim 2); and Dissect the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial harvesting (Aim 3). These
studies can lead to paradigm shift in immunotherapy and generate fundamental insights into
cancer-immune cell communications at the nanoscale."

The long-term goal of the CEOC is to develop community-based research priorities that can be translated into improved
health outcomes in ND. This will include an implementation plan to improve health status by linking research findings to
policy and program development and by promoting dialogue and disseminating the research findings to tribal leaders,
community stakeholders, and research scientists. Using a Community-Based, Participatory Research (CBPR) framework,
an implementation plan will be developed in close partnership with communities participating in TRANSCEND activities.
The short-term goal of the CEOC is to engage rural, urban, and tribal partners through the CBPR framework. Community
engagement is essential to the success of clinical and translational research projects and will facilitate the effectiveness
of investigators’ work within these communities.
Through the following Specific Aims, the CEOC will 1) Engage community advisory boards to identify and prioritize the

imaging techniques to their repertoire of research tools. This Core is housed in a dedicated suite of rooms
totaling 921 sq. ft. Access and training are provided for instrumentation used in 1) processing ocular tissue for
light and confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ
hybridization, and 2) capturing and processing images from live or fixed tissues. Equipment available in this
Core includes two cryostats, a paraffin processing and embedding station and paraffin microtome, an
ultramicrotome for ultra-thin sectioning for electron microscopy, two research-grade epifluorescence
microscopes, a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, a newly installed Leica Stellaris 8 Confocal Microscopy
System and a Leica laser microdissection microscope. In addition, there are computer workstations dedicated
to image analysis that run a stand-alone version of Leica AF, plus MetaMorph, Imaris and other imaging
software packages.
The Morphology and Imaging Core is staffed by a full-time technician, Mr. Brad Nelson, who processes and
sections fixed tissues, assists users with experimental methods, trains users on the epifluorescence
microscopes and the microscopes’ imaging software. Another key function of the technician is to maintain the
Core’s equipment. A second key staff person, Dr. Steve Lentz (20% effort, paid by the Department of
Ophthalmology), trains users on the confocal microscopes and the advanced features of the Leica AF,
MetaMorph, and Imaris software packages. During the next funding period, it is anticipated that 15
investigators will use this Core to a moderate or extensive degree. During the past 5 years, this Core was
moderately or extensively utilized by 14 investigators."

The MYC oncogene is a common cause of human cancers and the presence of MYC alterations is
associated with poor prognosis for hematological malignancies. To date, there are no FDA approved
MYC specific drugs and this is an area of active research. Our laboratory is focused on understanding
how MYC causes cancer and identifying genes and pathways that can be targeted to treat cancer.
There is now a wealth of evidence indicating that MYC suppresses the immune system during tumor
development and experimental inactivation of MYC relieves this suppression resulting in an anti-cancer
immune response. While we have mechanistic insight into how MYC regulates CD4+ T-cells, NK cells
and macrophages, it is still not know whether MYC also influences B-cell immunity. This fact is
suggested by our preliminary data which indicates that experimental shut off of MYC results in an
enhanced serum IgG antibody response that appears to be tumor specific. This begs the question of
how exactly B-cell responses are altered in the presence of MYC activation, what antigens are being
recognized and what impact do serum antibodies and B-cells have on disease regression following
MYC inactivation. We hypothesize that that MYC inactivation leads to a change in the B-cell MHC
class II peptide repertoire altering the type and spectrum of antigens presented and contributing to
increased tumor immunogenicity. We will use a well described model of MYC-driven T-cell acute
lymphoblastic lymphoma (hMYC T-ALL) to address the following two aims: AIM 1) Interrogate the role
of MYC on regulating the B-cell MHC II antigen processing machinery and AIM 2) defining the influence
of MYC on the B-cell MHC class II peptide repertoire. It is our hope that this study will identify new
antigenic targets and antibodies that will form the basis of future therapies and additional lines of
inquiry."

Alcohol use is rapidly increasing in low- and middle-income countries, where it is inexpensive, readily
available, poorly regulated, and there are few resources devoted to promoting safe alcohol use. Like
many other limited resource settings, there are few alcohol treatment facilities or addiction
practitioners in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. For many in this setting, people only seek care
after an emergency condition. Our preliminary work suggests up to 30% of patients in the Emergency
Department have harmful or hazardous drinking behaviors. Our team has created a brief
negotiational intervention with a text based booster called the “Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako
(PPKAY)/ Reduce Alcohol for Your Health.” Our recent pragmatic trial has demonstrated its
effectiveness at reducing alcohol use after an acute visit to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center
in Moshi, Tanzania. As such, this program planning project plan for the regional implementation of this
intervention through mixed method site evaluations and co-design of final intervention,
implementation strategy and trial protocols with our Tanzanian partners. This will prepare us to
conduct an innovative hybrid implementation trial to implement this culturally adapted, resource
appropriate and evidence based intervention."
10989869,"Background. Depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder that carries a heavy disease burden and
is the 2nd leading risk factor for suicide among Veterans. VA has disseminated three effective psychotherapies
for depression to VA clinics but therapist use of these treatments is <12%. Surprisingly, no studies have
examined the provision of evidence-based psychotherapies for depression (D-EBPs) in VA and reasons
underlying infrequent delivery, leaving a critical gap in depression care delivery in VA. System factors are a
known driver of EBP use, and early signs from OMHSP's efforts and unique factors related to how depression
care is organized in VA warrant an empirical investigation. Significance. Low utilization of D-EBPs and the
lack of empirical evidence on barriers is a significant problem for several reasons. First, suicide prevention is a
top priority in VA and across the nation and untreated depression is a major risk factor for suicide. Second,
effectiveness of existing interventions that target provider-level barriers cannot be maximized without data
about system barriers. Increasing the reach of other EBPs (e.g., PTSD) has required intervention at all levels
(patient, provider, and system) and the same is undoubtably true for D-EBPs. Identifying and targeting system
factors and exploring therapist factors and conducting the first exploration of patient perceptions of D-EBPs will
bolster these early provider-focused interventions. Furthermore, this proposal is timely in that it comes on the
heels of OMHSP's shift from assessing anticipated barriers to D-EBP delivery during trainings to developing
partnerships to understand barriers experienced in the field. Finally, since this proposal is examining D-EBP
delivery in specialty mental health clinics where other mental health conditions are treated, findings have
implications of EBPs for those other conditions. Innovation/Impact. The proposed 3.5-year study will be the
first study to examine reasons for low utilization of depression EBPs by therapists in VA. Our mixed-methods
approach will yield a robust understanding of how the policies, resources and culture within specialty mental
health clinics contribute to low D-EBP use by therapists. Our aims are directly aligned with OMHSP's goal to
increase the implementation of clinical practice guideline-concordant care in VA mental health clinics. Our
proposed classification of all VA medical centers on system-level factors that are associated with D-EBP
delivery, strategic qualitative analysis, intervention mapping and stakeholder engagement provides invaluable
data to OMHSP and the field quickly. Aims. 1) Quantitatively examine the association between health system
factors and D-EBP delivery; 2) Qualitatively examine how contextual and system factors impact therapist
decisions around the provision of D-EBPs; 3) Develop a framework of intervention targets and potential
solutions to reduce barriers to D-EBP use; 4) Secondary/Exploratory Aims: a) Qualitatively explore how
therapist factors impact D-EBP use; b) Explore patients' perceptions of D-EBPs. Methodology. Using an
explanatory sequential mixed-method design, in Aim 1 (quantitative) we will abstract system-level and EBP
training data for FY21 Q3-FY22 Q2. Descriptive statistics of system-level factors and general linear mixed
model analysis will be used to characterize facilities and examine associations between system factors and
therapists' D-EBP use. This will enable us to quickly understand both the main correlates of D-EBP utilization
and variability of these factors across sites, provide critical data to our OMHSP partners and inform selection of
sites for Aim 2. Aim 2 and secondary aims (qualitative) will include interviews with therapists trained in the
three D-EBPs and mental health leaders from 10 VA medical centers (5 high and 5 low performers; N = 120-
150) and 20 patients to understand their perceptions of D-EBPs. Aim 3 will involve intervention mapping and
Delphi strategies to develop a framework for reducing system barriers to D-EBP delivery. Implementation.
Findings from our intervention framework development and strong partnership with OMHSP will maximize the
translation of study findings into practice."
10986618,"Project Summary / Abstract
Corneal epithelium is maintained by stem cells residing in the limbus, the area between the cornea and
conjunctiva. These stem cells are known as limbal stem cells (LSCs) and give rise to progenitor cells, which
migrate toward central and apical cornea to form the stratified corneal epithelial cell layers. Loss of LSCs result
in limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD); the patients suffer from severe vision loss due to the ingrowth of cloudy
conjunctiva. While unilateral LSCD can be treated by transplantation of autologous limbal tissue, patients with
bilateral LSCD have to rely on allogeneic transplantation and the clinical outcome is relatively poor. In addition,
there are multiple post-operative complications reported including recurrent/persistent epithelial erosion,
intraocular pressure elevation, and rejection. Moreover, the shortage of corneal donors reduces the opportunity
for allogeneic transplantation. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop a less invasive therapy to treat
LSCD that also addresses the donor shortage. Besides the graft condition, it is important to control recipients’
limbal niche microenvironment for a successful transplantation, since there has been growing awareness of the
fact that limbal niche cells play a critical role for the maintenance of LSCs. Of the niche cells, limbal fibroblasts
are thought to contribute to the maintenance of corneal epithelial phenotype by secreting fibroblast growth
factor 7 (FGF7), whose secretion is promoted by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and interleukin 1
beta (IL1β). However, it remains largely unknown how limbal fibroblasts are affected in the LSCD and how the
recovery of limbal fibroblasts contributes to the success of the treatment of LSCD.
 Our long-term goal is to develop a novel treatment for LSCD by recovering the function of limbal niche.
Our overall objective in this proposal is to reveal the contribution of limbal fibroblasts in normal and LSCD
conditions, and to establish a limbal fibroblast injection as a novel LSCD therapy. Our central hypothesis is that
limbal fibroblasts secrete FGF7 in response to PDGF and IL1β secreted by limbal dendritic cells to maintain
the limbal stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, we hypothesize that limbal niche cells including limbal fibroblasts
are disrupted in LSCD and injection of limbal fibroblasts regenerate the corneal phenotype in LSCD. In
addition, we will utilize a novel technique of eye-like organoid formation from human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) to create limbal fibroblasts as a cell source of injectable cells to resolve the corneal donor
shortage. Proposed study will reveal the characteristics of limbal fibroblasts and limbal dendritic cells (Aim 1),
evaluate the interaction of limbal niche cells and limbal epithelial cells (Aim 2), and establish limbal fibroblast
injection method for the treatment of mouse LSCD (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will improve
our understanding of limbal niche cells in normal and LSCD conditions, and provide us with another strategic
option to treat LSCD, namely limbal fibroblast injection. This will allow us to conduct larger animal experiments
and ultimately, apply this treatment to LSCD patients."
10986620,"The human pathogen, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), establishes latency only in neurons and can reactivate to
result in the production of infectious virus for transmission to a new host. Reactivation can result in lesions at
the body surface and encephalitis, in addition to potentially promoting the development of neurodegenerative
disease. Our previous work has found that the latent HSV genome is associated with repressive heterochro-
matin. Therefore, entry and maintenance of HSV latency are likely regulated by the nuclear environment in the
neurons, although specific proteins that function in neurons to promote heterochromatin-based silencing of the
viral genome are not known. We have found that the heterochromatin-associated protein, Alpha-Thalasse-
mia/mental Retardation X-linked (ATRX), is highly abundant in neurons. ATRX is a multi-functional, hetero-
chromatin-associated protein, and mutations in ATRX are associated with neurodevelopment disease. The role
of ATRX in neuronal development suggests a specific role for ATRX in modulating gene expression in neu-
rons. Importantly, we have found that ATRX is required to limit HSV gene expression in neurons and promote
entry into latency. Once latency is established, we have found that HSV genomes are associated with ATRX,
and these genomes are also enriched for histone H3 tri-methyl lysine 9 (H3K9me3). Furthermore, we have
found that ATRX acts as a barrier to HSV reactivation in response to cell stress. The goals of this project are to
determine the mechanistic functions of ATRX in regulating different stages of HSV latency. Based on our pre-
liminary data, we hypothesize that ATRX promotes the formation of H3K9 methylation to limit gene expression
and promote entry into latency (tested in aim 1). We also hypothesize that once latency is established, ATRX
binds to a sub-population of viral genomes that are enriched for the H3K9me3 modification and prevents lytic
gene expression occurring from these genomes (tested in aim 2). We will use our expertise in animal models
of HSV latency, in addition to in vitro models of HSV latency and reactivation established in our lab, to test
these hypotheses. In aim 1, we will determine the contribution of ATRX in deposition and spreading of the
H3K9me3 modification, in addition to the role of H3K9me3 in promoting entry into latency. In aim 2, we will de-
termine the mechanistic function of ATRX in preventing transcription from H3K9me3-associated genomes in
response to multiple reactivation stimuli. Therefore, this proposal is significant and innovative because it will
mechanistically determine the contribution of an abundant neuronal protein to both promoting HSV latency and
preventing reactivation. Understanding this is crucial because it may be possible to utilize the role of ATRX to
develop therapies that prevent HSV reactivation. Given that mutations to the H3K9me3 reading domain of
ATRX are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, understanding the mechanism by which ATRX regu-
lates gene expression in neurons could lead to broader treatments beyond HSV."
10986720,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
 We propose to leverage innovative in situ cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques to study
dysregulated protein synthesis, termed translation, in an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) model. Dysregulated
translation disrupts normal neuronal plasticity, leading to various disorders including autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), major depressive disorders, chronic pain, and other pathologies affecting millions worldwide. However,
a comprehensive understanding of location-dependent ribosome regulation, which plays a crucial role in
plasticity, remains elusive. Current methods to study single events at a high resolution in cells are limited,
hindering the acquisition of this essential knowledge. We will overcome this limitation using correlative
fluorescence microscopy and in situ cryo-EM.
 The loss of the Fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product, known as FMRP, is responsible for
the most prevalent form of heritable ASD. FMRP interacts with polysomes within two types of RNA granules:
fragile X granules (FXGs) and neuronal RNA granules (nRNAgs), also known as ""transport granules."" Excessive
translation resulting from the absence of FMRP has been associated with long-term memory impairment,
supported by the notion that neuronal granules contribute to memory and synaptic plasticity. Despite its broad
importance in neuronal function, the pleiotropic nature of FMRP has prevented the field from developing a unified
understanding of its functions and its underlying role in local translation. To address this, we will develop novel
high-resolution approaches to unravel the functions of FMRP in translation within neuronal models. These
advances will pave the way for investigating FMRP's involvement in translational regulation using disease
models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
 We propose in this project to apply cutting-edge cryo-EM methods and develop effective workflows in
two Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop a protocol to determine the localization, activity, and structure of
FMRP granule-associated ribosomes in iPSCs. This aim will establish a workflow and reveal how ribosome
localization and activity are regulated by FMRP in neurites. In aim 2, we will determine the localization, activity
and structures of ribosomes associated with nRNAgs and FXGs. This aim will reveal how ribosome inactivation
differs between granule types. More broadly, these investigations will lay the foundation for mechanistic studies
aimed at understanding how translation contributes to human disease in a location-specific manner.
 Our work will provide structural insights into translational regulation, a fundamental process for proper
neuron function. Furthermore, it will enable the application of this analysis to patient-derived human iPSC models
of neurodevelopmental diseases, aligning with the missions of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive malignancies,
with more than 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer presenting with metastatic disease, mainly
in the liver, at the time of diagnosis. We have previously described the presence of microbes in
pancreatic cancer which could determine outcomes. Furthermore, we revealed that microbial
modulation can affect tumor microbial composition, immune cells landscape and tumors growth.
We have now preliminary data showing microbial distribution across tumors and cellular
compartments. Moreover, we have been able to perform spatial microbial functional assessment
at regional and single cell level. We have identified similar microbes in primary tumors and
matched liver metastasis, suggesting microbial seeding from primary tumors to liver. More
evidence for this is our findings revealing that NETosis, a process of host defense against
microbes, is upregulated in liver during the metastatic process. The overall goal of this proposal
is to deeply characterize the location, distribution and spatial functionality of microbes within the
tumor microenvironment of primary tumors as well as their influence in tumors growth, pre-
metastatic niche and liver metastasis formation. To this end, we will use multiple methodologies
including state-of-the-art microbial-host imaging, regional and single cell microbial-host
sequencing to determine the location of bacteria within the cellular compartments, patterns of
distribution, functionality and species characterization together with screening culturomics (Aim
1). We will then use multiple mouse models to fully characterize the role of human PDAC microbes
in primary tumor growth, metastatic niche and liver metastasis formation by adding human-
pancreatic cancer derived microbes allowing in vivo tracking of microbial-containing cancer cells
as well as local and global microbial ablation, in vitro organoid microbial co-cultures and
assessment/modulation of NETosis to determine their role in mediating microbial effects (Aim 2).
The success of this proposal has high potential for the development of novel microbial modulation
strategies that target the tumor microenvironment which could ultimately lead to improved
outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer."
10996651,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Maternal infections during pregnancy lead to adverse outcomes for the offspring, including short-term
outcomes such as intrauterine fetal demise, preterm delivery and neonatal sepsis, and long-term sequelae
such as neurodevelopmental impairment. A key factor contributing to fetal/neonatal susceptibility to infection is
the failure to robustly produce innate immune cells such as neutrophils that form a first line of defense against
infection. We recently made the novel observation that fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
are extrinsically restricted from activating the pathways that would lead to rapid production of neutrophils,
termed emergency myelopoiesis (EM), by maternal interleukin-10 (IL-10), although how maternal IL-10
restricts fetal EM is unknown. Altered placental function is proposed to be the critical central mediator linking
the effects of maternal inflammation on adverse outcomes in the offspring. In particular, maternal inflammation
increases placental synthesis of serotonin that is released into the fetal circulation, reaching the fetal brain and
disrupting the growth of serotonergic axons. We have found that fetal HSPCs express serotonin receptors and
their proliferation is suppressed in vitro by serotonin, supporting the hypothesis that placental serotonin may
also regulate fetal hematopoiesis. This proposal will test the hypothesis that maternal IL-10 restricts fetal
emergency myelopoiesis via a multi-layered cascade of events involving a network of maternal
decidual immune cells that trigger placental serotonin synthesis which is then released into the fetal
circulation and reaches the fetal liver where it regulates fetal HSPCs in either a direct manner or
indirectly by regulating the stromal and mature hematopoietic cells of the fetal liver niche. Our
approach will be to 1) identify the IL-10-responsive cell in the maternal-fetal milieu and determine the function
of that cell that results in restriction of fetal emergency myelopoiesis, and 2) determine how maternal
inflammation is sensed in the fetal liver microenvironment and whether this signal, which we predict to be
serotonin, regulates fetal HSPC function directly or indirectly. We predict that maternal IL-10 restricts fetal EM
via its baseline function of establishing a tolerogenic profile in maternal decidual macrophages and that in its
absence, the exaggerated inflammatory response of alternatively-primed macrophages negatively impacts
placental function resulting in increased synthesis of serotonin that regulates fetal HSPCs directly and
indirectly. This project will systematically identify the mechanisms by which maternal inflammation is translated
across the placenta and sensed in the fetal liver to modulate fetal HSPC emergency myelopoiesis, uncovering
potential nodes along the cascade that might be amenable to therapeutic targeting, and ultimately boosting
neonatal immune function and improving neonatal outcomes."
10996718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the second most common disease of childhood which results in substantial morbidity
and mortality. This autoimmune disease is characterized by the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells into the islets
of Langerhans in the pancreas, where they ultimately deplete insulin-secreting  cells. Recent studies have
shown that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) are required for the development of Type 1 diabetes in the
murine NOD model, which has many parallels to human disease. cDC1 are unique in their ability to efficiently
cross-present  cell antigens to and prime autoreactive CD8 T cells. Furthermore, cDC1 are potent producers of
IL-12 and may facilitate Th1 differentiation of CD4 T cells. A therapy that specifically eliminates cDC1 may
therefore be expected to prevent the development of T1D by blocking autoreactive CD4 Th1 development as
well as the presentation of self-antigens to autoreactive CD8 T cells. Our preliminary data show that a chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell targeting XCR1, a chemokine receptor expressed by cDC1, is successful in
depleting cDC1 in the spleen and pancreatic lymph node of NOD mice. Furthermore, cDC1 depletion by this
CAR T cell also successfully inhibited the proliferation of a cDC1 dependent, self-reactive CD4 T cell in vivo.
Thus, the central premise of this proposal is that XCL1 CAR T cells may be useful for the prevention of T1D.
To address this, we will assess the ability of this CAR to prevent diabetes in NOD mice. Experiments proposed
in Aim 1 will validate the specificity of the CAR for cDC1s and address the durability of cDC1 depletion in vivo.
Aim 2 will assess the functional effects of cDC1 depletion by CAR T cells on autoimmune diabetes by assessing
CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers and phenotypes within the islets as well as the rate of spontaneous diabetes
incidence in NOD mice. Collectively, these studies may lead to the development of a novel preventative treatment
for human Type 1 diabetes and establish a paradigm for CAR T cell mediated immunomodulation via selective
targeting of DC subsets."
10996720,"PROJECT SUMMARY. CANDIDATE: Mathew Wingerson is a doctoral student at the University of Colorado
Anschutz School of Medicine pursuing research innovations to support clinical management of concussion. His
doctoral research has investigated novel approaches to prescribing aerobic exercise in clinical settings to
facilitate concussion recovery. The training plan and research proposed in this F31 application will further equip
him for an independent research career investigating post-concussion diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation.
DOCTORAL TRAINING PLAN: The training plan aims to (1) develop expertise as a clinical trialist in rehabilitation
sciences, (2) expand knowledge in advanced data science methods for clinical research, and (3) gain meaningful
experience in concussion fluid biomarkers of recovery and brain pathophysiology. These objectives will be
achieved through coursework, research experience, conference attendance, and mentorship from a
multidisciplinary team. SPONSOR, CO-SPONSOR, & COLLABORATORS: Dr. David Howell, an expert in
concussion research, and Dr. Brianne Bettcher, a specialist in brain biomarkers, will serve as the project sponsor
and co-sponsor. Additional contributions from Dr. Jonathan Smirl, a cerebrovascular physiologist, and Dr. Patrick
Carry, an applied biostatistician and epidemiologist, will supplement the training plan, providing their expertise
to facilitate Mathew’s doctoral education and successful execution of the research project. Dr. Julie Wilson, a
physician-researcher and director of concussion clinical care at the Children's Hospital Colorado Sports Medicine
Center, offers an expert clinical perspective throughout the execution of the training plan and research, having
provided clinical management to children and adolescents with concussion for >13 years. RESEARCH: Active
rehabilitation after concussion, including engagement with aerobic exercise, is standard-of-care clinical practice.
Existing guidelines for prescribing aerobic exercise are complex, resource- and time-inefficient, and impractical
for some clinical settings. Concussion-induced physiological impairments, such as cerebrovascular dysfunction,
persist beyond symptom resolution and may not be effectively treated by current rehabilitation guidelines. This
proposed research challenges existing clinical practice recommendations by investigating moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA), an innovative, clinically pragmatic rehabilitation strategy, as an efficacious approach to
treating post-concussion physiological disturbances. Leveraging resources and data from an NIH-funded parent
study (R01HD108133; enrollment goal: n=288), the project will identify important longitudinal relationships
between post-concussion MVPA and cerebrovascular recovery. The study will deliver precise MVPA-based
rehabilitative recommendations poised for immediate clinical implementation to facilitate recovery of concussion-
induced impairments in physiological systems."
10995719,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Day/night cycles profoundly impact animals’ physiology and behavior to allow adaptation to rhythmic environmental
cues. Daily rhythmic behaviors are believed to be patterned by central clock neurons. However, the physiology of
primary sensory neurons, such as olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), can also exhibit oscillatory changes, but
whether such changes can guide rhythmic behaviors remains undetermined. Progress is further hindered by the lack
of information on whether or which odor-guided behaviors are regulated by day/night cycles. This proposal leverages
the powerful genetic toolkit and tractable olfactory system of D. melanogaster to address these fundamental yet
outstanding questions. Preliminary studies showed that pheromone-sensing ORNs exhibit higher responses in flies
at subjective night (henceforth referred to as night flies) than in flies at subjective day (henceforth referred to as day
flies). Importantly, this heightened pheromone sensitivity in night flies in turn elevates odor-guided social behavior.
Mechanistically, the day or night modulation is respectively signaled via two neuromodulators. Preliminary
experiments further showed that in theses ORNs, the day/night modulation of olfactory acuity requires a cation
channel subunit whose expression likely reduces neuronal input resistance or causes accommodation, thus lowering
spike response frequency. These findings led to the hypothesis that day/night cycles, through the antagonistic actions
of two neuromodulators, up- or down-regulate the cation channel in ORNs to dynamically modulate olfactory acuity
and odor-guided behavior. To test this central hypothesis, this research will determine how the two neuromodulators
antagonistically regulate ORN responses (Aim 1), characterize the effector(s) capable of altering olfactory responses
in the target ORNs (Aim 2), and investigate the generality of the neuromodulatory mechanism across ORN types
(Aim 3). The mechanistic insights expected from this research will advance our understanding of how day/night cycles
influence olfactory physiology and behavior. Of further significance, this research demonstrates that neuromodulatory
impairment at the ORN level precludes the potential influence of central circadian mechanisms on odor-guided
behavior. The idea that peripheral sensory neuromodulation plays a critical role in gating day/night-regulated
behaviors is conceptually innovative. Furthermore, in rodents, the neuronal responses to ethologically relevant odors
are also heightened at subjective nighttime. Therefore, success of this research will likely carry broad implications
across animal species."
10993232,"Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the tooth-supporting tissue, affecting up 50% of the
population and two-thirds of the elderly in the United States. Progressive neurological deterioration during poses
a significant burden for the elderly population, with high prevalence of cognitive decline in those over the age of
85 years old. Emerging evidence suggests a link between poor oral health, cognitive impairment and neurological
conditions. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and associated cellular milieu of the neurovascular unit (NVU) including
microglia, pericytes and astrocytes serve as a crucial interface for neuroimmune communication and
physiological maintenance of the central nervous system. Healthy aging is associated with normal physiological
changes in the integrity and function of both the BBB and NVU. Sustained dysbiotic chronic systemic
inflammation of periodontitis may contribute to prolonged neuroinflammation, functional cognitive impairment
and neurodegenerative dysfunction. Dysbiosis of the dental plaque microbiome community occurs during
periodontitis, with increased abundance of multiple species of Treponema spirochetes. Continued evidence
indicates positive correlation of Treponema species in dental plaque and their presence in brain and neurological
tissue of patients with cognitive disorders. Despite known extraoral relationships of these understudied
spirochete organisms, there is still a significant gap in knowledge of how oral bacteria mechanistically impact the
BBB and NVU to contribute to cognitive disorders. Our central hypothesis is that periodontal pathogens including
Treponema species promote glial activation with BBB dysfunction, and thus contributes to a significant
neuroinflammatory response and consequent neurodegeneration; playing a key pathophysiological role in
bacterial-induced modulation of the neuro-immune axis. We will test our hypothesis by completion of the
following specific aims: 1. Characterize the ability of oral spirochetes to promote blood-brain barrier (BBB)
dysfunction and 2. Assess the ability of oral spirochetes to drive an inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammatory
phenotype and transcriptional signature in glial cells of neurovascular unit. Understanding the underlying
mechanisms involved in the interaction between microbes, inflammation and cellular components of the nervous
system is vital for the early intervention and improvement of neurological disorders."
10996258,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; e.g., abuse, neglect, substance use) exert significant impact on adult
health outcomes. Numerous studies have demonstrated a dose-relationship between the number of adversities
experienced in childhood and adverse health outcomes in adulthood. In contrast, positive childhood
experiences (PCEs) stem from safe, secure, nurturing relationships and environments, create a sense of
belonging, and instill a sense of well-being. PCEs have been shown to have a protective effect on adult health
outcomes, even in the presence of ACEs. Less is known about the intergenerational transmission of ACEs and
PCEs (e.g., how parents’ own childhood experiences shape their parenting and subsequently impact their
children’s experiences). Exploring the effects of PCEs and parenting practices on intergenerational trauma
transmission among families could provide additional insight on parental transmission of both positive and
adverse childhood experiences. The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National
Research Service Award (NRSA) application is to prepare the applicant to become an independent research
scientist through tailored, mentored training and research experience. There are two aspects of this fellowship:
1) a training plan with objectives in methods proficiency, substantive expertise, and role attainment; and 2) a
research project focused on understanding the role of PCEs in mitigating the effects of ACEs. A strong
mentorship team that includes a sponsor, co-sponsor, and collaborators from the University of Michigan
Schools of Nursing, Public Health, and Medicine, and consultants with expertise in the proposed data set and
methods, will provide the necessary guidance in childhood experiences, parenting, and mixed methods. The
proposed research project is a mixed methods study that will include a secondary data analysis from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative study that includes intergenerational data on childhood
experiences and parenting, and primary qualitative data collection and analysis from parents with young
children. Study aims are as follows:1) to investigate the extent to which parental PCEs moderate the
association between parental ACEs and their children’s ACEs; 2) to investigate the extent to which positive
parenting practices mediate the association between parental ACEs and their children's ACEs; and 3) to
explore parents' perceptions of their own childhood experiences, both positive and negative, on their
subsequent parenting practices. Findings will be integrated to offer a more nuanced approach and deeper
understanding of what childhood experiences have the greatest impact on the next generation. The proposed
research aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. This fellowship
would allow for important learning opportunities and mentoring in mixed methods study design and analysis,
secondary quantitative data analysis, and primary qualitative data collection and analysis, helping to lay a solid
foundation for a future program of research focused on mixed methods study design and research."
10996325,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a significant problem that can cause life-threatening hemorrhage.
Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs), which differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental processes driving MK differentiation, therapeutic strategies
for thrombocytopenia remain limited. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that repress gene expression by
directing silencing machinery to mRNA targets. Dozens of microRNAs have been implicated in hematopoiesis,
or the production of mature blood cells from HSCs. Most microRNAs are long-lived in cells (up to several
days), but some are actively degraded in a process termed target-directed microRNA degradation (TDMD),
which is mediated by the protein ZSWIM8. TDMD rapidly depletes cells of specific microRNAs, thus relieving
repression on their target mRNAs. Homozygous knockout (KO) of Zswim8 in mice leads to 100% perinatal
lethality and increased expression >50 microRNAs (ZSWIM8-sensitive microRNAs) in at least one embryonic
tissue examined, highlighting ZSWIM8’s physiologic importance. Several of these ZSWIM8-sensitive
microRNAs have been previously implicated in hematopoiesis. Limited published data suggest a particularly
important role for microRNA decay mechanisms in MK differentiation, as numerous microRNAs are reported to
be downregulated during MK maturation. Further, preliminary results from Zswim8 KO mouse embryos showed
that out of all cell lineages assessed, the largest effect was in the MK lineage. Hematopoiesis is a stepwise
process that requires sequential shifts in the HSC’s gene expression profile as it differentiates into
progressively restricted cell types, which may necessitate active degradation of microRNAs that would
otherwise persist in the cell for several days. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that ZSWIM8-
mediated TDMD remodels the cellular microRNA environment to promote gene expression shifts during
hematopoietic differentiation. Currently, there is no published information on the role of ZSWIM8-mediated
TDMD in hematopoiesis. Aim 1 seeks to characterize the effect of ZSWIM8-mediated TDMD on mammalian
hematopoiesis in the fetal and adult stages, as well as during reconstitution of the hematopoietic stem cell
niche after bone marrow transplant. Aim 2 focuses on the apparent role of ZSWIM8-mediated TDMD in MK
differentiation. MKs will be derived from murine primary cell cultures. Small-RNA sequencing of these cultured
MKs will identify microRNAs that are degraded by ZSWIM8-mediated TDMD. Overexpression experiments will
pinpoint the microRNAs able to explain the ZSWIM8-dependent MK differentiation phenotype. Pairing these
analyses with bulk RNA sequencing will implicate downstream gene regulatory networks impacted by ZSWIM8.
Altogether, this work will elucidate the role of ZSWIM8-mediated TDMD on cell fate specialization and uncover
novel roles for microRNA regulation in mammalian hematopoiesis."

Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological condition affecting 3.4 million Americans, with 0.6% of children dealing
with active epilepsy. Mutations in the four main voltage-gated sodium channels active in the brain are leading
causes of pediatric epilepsies, with mutations in SCN8A accounting for up to 1% of all epilepsy diagnoses.
Many patients do not respond to current anti-epileptic drugs and current treatments focus only on treating
seizures, but not on correcting the disorder. There is a critical need for new treatments for patients with SCN8A
epilepsy. Exon 5 in SCN8A undergoes a highly conserved and developmentally regulated alternative splicing
during development, with initially higher usage of the 5N “neonatal” exon, shifting gradually to predominant
splicing of the 5A “adult” exon in late childhood. Recent studies show that Nav1.6 encoded by 5N-containing
cDNA is less active than Nav1.6 encoded by 5A-containing cDNA in neuroblastoma cells, and that inclusion of
exon 5A or 5N in SCN8A mRNAs can impact the effect of pathogenic mutations in other regions of the gene on
Nav1.6 function. There are over 40 patients with SCN8A epilepsy that have mutations in exon 5 of SCN8A,
that could potentially benefit from a splice-switching ASO therapy as it would prevent inclusion of the mutated
exon, switching to the intact exon, without altering Nav1.6 protein expression. Further, the mechanism which
regulates this switch in splicing from 5N to 5A in SCN8A remain poorly understood.
We have optimized ASOs that induce a switch in splicing between exon 5N and 5A in both directions and
developed a novel mouse model of SCN8A epilepsy with a pathogenic mutation in exon 5N. The ASOs we
have developed can be used to study the role of each exon in brain function, neuronal development and
susceptibility to seizures in healthy mice and as a therapeutic approach for patients with mutations in exon 5.
We hypothesize that the alternative splicing of Scn8a exon 5 controls Nav1.6 activity and seizure
susceptibility in the brain, and that ASO-driven splice switching to replace mutated exons with healthy
exons in Scn8a mRNAs can reduce or prevent epilepsy, improve development and extend survival.
First, we will evaluate the role of Scn8a exon 5 alternative splicing on brain activity, neuronal excitability, and
seizure susceptibility. Second, we will determine the efficacy of an Scn8a splice-switching ASO in correcting
Nav1.6 function and reducing seizure activity in a mutant exon 5N Scn8a mouse model. Third, we will identify
RNA elements and splicing factors that regulate the splicing of Scn8a exons 5N/5A and use this knowledge to
design new ASOs with distinct regulatory effects.
These studies will shed light on the regulation of Nav1.6 activity, findings that could be applied to the other
sodium channels in the brain, which are highly conserved and undergo a similar pattern of splicing regulation.
The development of a disease-modifying treatment for patients with mutations in exon 5 of SCN8A may not
only reduce seizures, but also aid development, increase functional skills, improve quality of life and reduce
mortality in patients with severe DEE."

As many as three in four older adults live with chronic pain; a debilitating condition that affects quality of life
and independence. Unfortunately, chronic pain both affects and is affected by low levels of physical activity,
excess sustained sedentary time, weight gain, and isolation. Across Stage Ia and Ib pilot trials, we have
demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefit of a remote group-mediated behavioral
intervention rooted in social cognitive and self-determination theories that targets dietary weight loss via caloric
restriction and both increased physical activity and decreased sitting via the accumulation of steps in frequent
bouts throughout the day (daylong physical activity). Limitations of previous research include: short duration
(12 weeks), small samples (up to 44 participants per study), and the inclusion of heterogeneous pain sites. The
primary purpose of this Stage II R01 is to test the efficacy of 6 months of a remotely delivered group-mediated
weight loss+daylong movement on daily steps (primary outcome), pain interference (secondary outcome), body
weight, pain intensity, quality of life, and key psychosocial antecedents of behavior change in older adults with
chronic knee or hip osteoarthritic pain. We will also explore for effects on long-term behavior change over 12
months following the intervention. We propose to randomize low-active older adults with chronic osteoarthritic
pain and obesity to the weight loss+daylong physical activity intervention or to an enhanced usual care control.
These individuals will receive the same self-monitoring technologies as the intervention condition to account for
any effect of basic device provision on activity and diet behavior. The results of this trial will inform future real-
world efficacy and effectiveness trials of a package well-suited to broad scale delivery."
10978781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use accounts for 1 in 5 deaths of individuals aged 20 to 49 years old, and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
is associated with deficits in brain structure and function, but it remains unclear which of these brain
abnormalities can recover when alcohol use stops. Understanding brain changes associated with early
abstinence occurring through evidence-based residential treatment may offer insights into the biological basis
of AUD and potential therapeutic targets. This proposal aims to fill a gap in understanding how the neural
mechanisms associated with cognitive reappraisal (e.g., prefrontal cortex [PFC]) and alcohol cue reactivity
(e.g., striatum) change during early abstinence, and whether changes in these mechanisms can predict the
individuals most likely to return to heavy alcohol use. We and others have shown that, relative to healthy
adults, individuals with AUD have greater difficulties with emotion regulation and greater craving and alcohol
cue reactivity. Yet, it remains unclear how abstinence affects brain function during reappraisal and cue
reactivity, and how this relates to risk for future alcohol use. Here, we propose to study patients with AUD (N =
150) engaged in ecologically-valid residential treatment to determine the neural mechanisms that change
during early abstinence and if they indicate risk for return to heavy drinking. We will assess these individuals
using fMRI within 4 days of admission to treatment and again within 2 days before discharge. We will also
follow participants for 6 months to assess frequency of heavy drinking. We will use cutting-edge analytic
techniques to maximize our ability to observe differences. Specifically, we will use multivariate pattern analysis
to quantify neural signatures of reappraisal and cue reactivity. We and others have developed models can
accurately identify brain activation associated with a) cognitive reappraisal and b) cue reactivity to drug stimuli.
These processes likely reflect circuit-driven neural underpinnings, thus in addition to neural signatures we will
examine connectivity between PFC and subcortical regions linked to craving and emotional reactivity. We can
then use machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between neural signatures, connectivity, and
variables associated with relapse risk, such as craving and poor emotional coping skills. We will use these
models to test our central hypothesis that neural function associated with reappraisal and alcohol cue reactivity
will change across abstinence and indicate likelihood of treatment success. Specific Aims are to 1) determine
how neural mechanisms related to reappraisal and alcohol cue-reactivity change across early abstinence
during treatment, 2) determine how circuit strength between the PFC and subcortical regions change across
early abstinence, and 3) identify neuroimaging variables that prospectively predict return to heavy drinking. The
proposal will improve understanding of the neural mechanisms that may recover with reduced drinking levels
and whether neural function indicates long-term success."

10978982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool."

One in three liver transplant recipients experiences a cardiovascular event within one year of transplant because
of immunosuppression medications and a high prevalence of potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors,
such as high blood pressure. Hypertension is the foremost modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events in liver
transplant recipients (LTRs); however, there is insufficient evidence to guide treatment approaches (e.g., blood
pressure target level, medication choice, treatment timing) of hypertension in LTRs that maximize cardiovascular
benefit while minimizing potential harms to the liver, kidney, and brain. Intensive blood pressure lowering is
indicated in high cardiovascular risk populations and cardiac biomarker levels can aid in matching blood
pressure-lowering therapy to those most likely to benefit; however, in LTRs, concerns about the harms and
tolerability of intensive blood pressure control limit aggressive blood pressure targets in clinical practice,
highlighting a need for a precision medicine approach to hypertension management in LTRs informed by cardiac
biomarker levels. To address these knowledge gaps for clinical practice, we will conduct a prospective,
multicenter, cohort study of 1,268 LTRs and measure 7-day home blood pressure, cardiac biomarker levels,
cardiovascular events, liver graft function, renal function, and cognitive function over two years with outcomes
up to five years post-transplant. We will determine the net clinical benefit of blood pressure-lowering on target
organs in LTRs (Aim 1), determine whether cardiac biomarker levels can improve stratification of cardiovascular
risk among LTRs with elevated blood pressure or hypertension (Aim 2), and identify optimal treatment
approaches in hypertension post-liver transplant that lower blood pressure and minimize cardiovascular events
(Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that elevated cardiac biomarker levels can inform optimal treatment
approaches for hypertension in LTRs that maximize cardiovascular benefit and minimize harms to the liver,
kidney, and brain. We will leverage the existing infrastructure of the Avoiding Cardiovascular Complications in
Liver Transplantation through Novel Studies (ACCT NOW) consortium, comprised of multidisciplinary clinicians
and researchers across six U.S. transplant centers, whose long-term goal is to establish evidence-based
guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in liver transplantation. The current aims, when achieved, will
(1) define hypertension treatment approaches that are most likely to effectively reduce blood pressure, a key
modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events, without causing harm in LTRs, (2) delineate the role of cardiac
biomarkers to guide these treatment decisions, and (3) identify which LTRs are most likely to benefit from
intensive blood pressure lowering to reduce cardiovascular risk. These data are essential for design of a future
randomized type II hybrid intervention trial that will test biomarker-based hypertension management strategies
in liver transplant recipients and support the first evidence-based guidance for managing hypertension after liver
transplantation."

Most people with substance use disorders (SUD) are parents (i.e., pregnant, postpartum, parenting). However,
parents with SUD receive little focused attention as it pertains to treatment services tailored to their needs as a
parent. Becoming a parent is lifechanging regardless of the outcome of a pregnancy or birth; it can facilitate
positive change and potential for hardships and challenges. These experiences impact the perceptions of
treatment utility, treatment engagement, and treatment success. Parent-centric research can identify barriers
and solutions to promote treatment acceptability, accessibility, and recovery. However, most research to date
on parents with SUD has been child-focused, emphasizing the goal of improving parenting practices. This
research is important, but leaves missed opportunities to consider the unique challenges and opportunities
associated with the parenting role. Research and practice are steeped with the narratives of parental unfitness
and cause significant harm to parents with SUD by deterring individuals from seeking treatment. Specifically,
parents with SUD may be deterred from treatment because of childcare constraints, fear of child removal, and
safety concerns in clinics. They may also face discrimination in treatment if they used substances during
pregnancy, experienced pregnancy and infant loss, or child removal. Self-stigma and discrimination of parents
with SUD can be addressed through translational research prioritizing parent-defined solutions to improve
outcomes for this uniquely disenfranchised population. Our team is particularly poised to complete this work.
We have built a dedicated infrastructure through the NIDA P50 Center on Parenting and Opioids Data
Collective and community boards. We intend to leverage these resources to establish a Patient Engagement
Resource Center (PERC) for parents with SUD. Our PERC will be a national resource with the goal of
addressing disparities in treatment engagement for parents with SUD. We will achieve this goal through our
specific aims. Aim 1 is to establish a lived expertise advisory panel (LEAP) of parents with SUD (n = 18)
which will support capacity building and mutual decision making among individuals most impacted by our
research. Aim 2 includes Aim 2a: conduct a mixed-methods research project (N = 190 quantitative, 40
qualitative) that will identify modifiable barriers and potential solutions to SUD treatment engagement and
success, as moderated by social determinants of health and parenting circumstances and Aim 2b: solicit
applications from external teams to address pilot project ideas generated by LEAP. Finally, Aim 3 is to
support national engagement with our parent SUD-focused PERC by leveraging and expanding our
existing Center infrastructure to support national research focused on studies to improve treatment outcomes
for parents with SUD. Our PERC will lay a path for transformative research to improve treatment acceptability,
engagement, and sustained recovery for parents with SUD. Without this dedicated effort, parents with SUD will
remain an afterthought in research focused on improving SUD treatment-related outcomes."

Perinatal depression (PND), defined as depression during pregnancy and up to one year postpartum, affects
more than 20% of pregnancies and disproportionately impacts Black Women and Latinas. PND increases risk
of preterm birth and infant neurodevelopment deficits. Yet we still do not fully understand the pathobiology of
PND, which limits efforts to improve its prevention, identification and treatment. Interactions between the host
and microbial communities that reside in the gut are essential for human health. Gut microorganisms play an
important role in producing beneficial metabolites, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA). The gut microbiota bidirectionally communicate with the brain, an interaction
mediated by the neurological, immune, and endocrine systems and coined as the microbiota-gut-brain axis
(MGBA). Our initial pilot results from a longitudinal study of low-income women of color (n=42) early in pregnancy,
which showed that multiple attributes of the MGBA were associated with depressive symptom severity, including
production of short chain fatty-acids, metabolism of tryptophan and GABA, and systemic inflammation mediated
by bile acid metabolism. Although our initial data points to new MGBA signatures linked to depressive symptom
severity in the first and second trimesters, additional work is needed to determine whether these signatures and
their interactions extend beyond the second trimester. Further, microbial metabolism is driven both by the
interactions between metabolites and by the interplay between microbial metabolic systems with maternal
inflammatory system and metabolism. Thus, determining the causal influence of these new MGBA signatures
on depressive symptom severity during the perinatal period requires using approaches that can establish the
effect of systems (networks) coupling in MGBA functioning. Here, we propose a clinical translational study to
determine the role of MGBA in PND by using a systems biology framework and an experimental animal model
to assess causality. To test this, we will draw from our research infrastructure to recruit 158 women (55% Black,
30% Latina) early in pregnancy (<16 gestational weeks) and follow them bimonthly for up to 6 weeks postpartum.
We will assess mood; lifestyle (diet, physical activity, sleep); and heart-rate variability (a proxy for stress) and
will measure microbial genome and meta-metabolome and maternal blood transcriptome and metabolome. In
Aim 1, we will employ interpretable machine learning models to predict depressive symptom severity
concurrently and prospectively. In Aim 2, we will establish coupling mechanisms that regulate symptom severity
by modeling the interplay between microbial and maternal metabolic, genetic and regulatory systems using
network theory. In Aim 3, we will determine the causal role of gut microbiota in symptom severity in a female
pregnant germ-free mouse model using fecal microbiota transplants. Our paradigm-shifting data-driven proposal
will identify host-microbial features predictive of perinatal depressive symptom severity and modifiable risk
factors for prevention and treatment of PND, with causality tested in animal models."

Reducing the large percentage of undesired pregnancies in the United States (43%) is a top public health priority
because control over pregnancy is crucial for women’s well-being and most undesired pregnancies result from
non-use or inconsistent use of contraceptives. Key barriers to scientific progress are a lack of tools to examine
risk perceptions and tolerance as key psychological mechanisms motivating contraceptive use among men and
women who do not desire a pregnancy and a lack of data from male partners who play a key role in contraceptive
decision-making. To help remedy barriers to understanding the mismatch between pregnancy desires and
contraceptive use that undergird the large fraction of undesired pregnancies in the United States, Dr. Littlejohn
and her mentoring team have designed training and research activities to give her key missing skills to become
an independent investigator in the interdisciplinary study of risk tolerance in contraceptive use among couples.
The key objective of this application is for Dr. Littlejohn, a sociologist, to gain the needed expertise to integrate
approaches from demography and psychology to generate and test novel hypotheses on risk perception and
tolerance among couples in the near-term and to learn how to prepare a successful R01 grant application for a
longitudinal study on risk tolerance among couples to achieve scientific independence in the long-term. To gain
the skills that Dr. Littlejohn needs to be a leader in this new field, she will pursue training in: (1) theories on the
psychology of risk perceptions/tolerance and the demography of human fertility, (2) cognitive interviewing to
pretest innovative adapted measures on risk tolerance, and (3) longitudinal analyses of data on couples. To gain
necessary skills to successfully apply for an R01 grant by the end of the award period, she will also pursue
training in (4) grant writing. These activities will allow her to achieve her two research aims: (1) Identify the
association between risk tolerance and contraceptive use among men and women who do not desire pregnancy
using systematically adapted validated measures of risk tolerance from health psychology, and (2) Quantify how
risk perceptions relate to contraceptive use among couples using longitudinal data. The application aligns with
the NICHD Population Dynamics Branch’s key priority in contraceptive use and non-use and will deploy
interdisciplinary insights to address the multiple levels of analysis required to robustly model contraceptive
behavior. Dr. Littlejohn’s activities will be supervised by a multidisciplinary team: co-primary mentors, Dr. Jennifer
Barber (sociology/demography, Indiana University) and Dr. Elliot Berkman (psychology/neuroscience, University
of Oregon), and advisory team members Dr. Ellen Peters (psychology, University of Oregon), Dr. Sharon Sassler
(sociology/demography, Cornell University), and Dr. Kari White (sociology/demography, University of Texas-
Austin). This K01 project will give Dr. Littlejohn the skills to achieve her goal of being an independent investigator
innovatively studying risk tolerance in contraceptive use among couples over time in service of improving
population health by helping people achieve their fertility goals."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, is the leading cause of
mortality and morbidity in both men and women in the US. Well-established risk factors for CVD include
modifiable lifestyle and non-modifiable host/biological variables, such as smoking, diet, BMI, age, sex, and
race/ethnicity, as well as quantitative cardiovascular traits, such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-
density/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. However, it is not yet clear
through which molecular mechanisms these lifestyle/host risk factors influence the cardiovascular traits and
CVD risk. Large-scale multiplatform omics data, including whole-genome sequencing, DNA methylation, and
gene expression data, have been recently generated in tens of thousands of well-phenotyped individuals in the
NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. These large-scale multi-omics and phenotype
data resources provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the relationships among
environmental/lifestyle risk factors and cardiovascular traits, and how molecular phenotypes work as
intermediate factors between them. However, it remains a significant analytical challenge to delineate those
complex relationships in the presence of multiple types of high-dimensional omics data. The objective of this
research is to capitalize on the multi-omics and phenotype data in the TOPMed program and our recently
developed statistical methods for high-dimensional mediation analysis to quantify the extent to which DNA
methylation and gene expression mediate the effects of environmental/lifestyle risk factors on (Aim 1)
quantitative cardiovascular traits and (Aim 2) the risk of incident CVD. We will identify mediating markers
based on high-dimensional variable selection methods and estimate the total mediation effects of DNA
methylation and gene expression, each alone and jointly, using 6,000 individuals in the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS) study as the discovery cohort and over 2,000 and 1,000 individuals, respectively, in the Women’s
Health Initiative (WHI) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) as validation cohorts. This study will
provide deep insights into molecular phenotypes and biological pathways that mediate the effect of
lifestyle/host risk factors on cardiovascular traits and CVD risk. Our findings may contribute to the discovery of
novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CVD, and biomarker-based precision prevention for this
devastating disease. The multi-omics-based mediation analysis pipeline established and refined through this
proposed research will also be applicable to other heart, lung and blood diseases in the TOPMed program."

Clinic-based hypertension care falls short in achieving blood pressure control, particularly for Black patients
with hypertension. Sporadic clinic visits do not support adequate time to improve patients' skills in hypertension
self-care or provide reliable and adequate blood pressure values to clinicians to support therapeutic decisions.
Telemedicine management of hypertension (TM-HTN) is a team-based approach that overcomes many of the
challenges of clinic-based care by offering more time for self-management support and better diagnostic
accuracy by leveraging multiple home blood pressure values to support clinicians' confidence in titrating
medications. In a meta-analysis of US-based clinical trials, we found that TM-HTN improved blood pressure by
7.3/2.7 mmHg, compared with usual clinic-based care. However, the effect was significantly diminished in trials
that enrolled a sizeable portion (39-100%) of Black patients per trial (4.4/1.1 mmHg) compared to trials
enrolling majority White patients (9.3/4.0 mmHg, p<0.01), likely because TM-HTN is not tailored for socially
disadvantaged Black patients. Creating a contextually responsive TM-HTN intervention for socially
disadvantaged Black patients and the clinics they attend has the potential to control hypertension in this
population who suffer the highest burden and disparity in hypertension control. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)
Evaluate barriers and facilitators to TM-HTN use among socially disadvantaged Black patients, healthcare
providers, and health system leaders; 2) Refine TM-HTN intervention for socially disadvantaged Black patients
using a Human-Centered Design approach and identify suitable implementation strategies; and 3) Assess
feasibility of TM-HTN intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial. Evaluating the feasibility of the
intervention that is responsive to the patient, provider, and system-level contextual factors has the promise to
improve blood pressure in socially disadvantaged Black patients and will help to launch the candidate's
independent patient-oriented research career to achieve his long-term goal of eliminating inequities in
cardiovascular disease prevention among vulnerable populations. The candidate has dedicated his
professional life to becoming a physician-scientist, studying cardiovascular prevention, epidemiology, and
outcomes research. He has accepted a faculty position at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine,
where a supportive research environment in the Department of Internal Medicine has made his career
advancement and approach to independence possible. To accomplish the goals of the proposed research, he
has assembled an experienced mentoring team with unique yet complementary expertise in qualitative and
mixed methods, implementation science, clinical trials, and health equity to guide his career development. The
candidate will undertake formal training in these areas to complement his prior medical, graduate, and
postgraduate training to transition to independence."

As the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, lung cancer accounts for about 20% of all cancer
deaths. While there are two major types of lung cancer (i.e., 80%~85% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and 10%~15% for small cell lung cancer (SCLC)), each type of lung cancer has multiple distinct subtypes
characterized by morphological, molecular, and genetic alterations. Identifying lung cancer subtypes can
facilitate downstream risk stratification and tailored treatment design. While various conventional methods like
morphological analysis, computed tomography (CT) and imaging techniques, cytogenetic analysis,
immunophenotyping, or molecular profiling have been used for lung cancer subtype identification, they are
usually costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. Recent progress has witnessed the
application of next generation sequencing (NGS) for identifying lung cancer subtypes, but they are limited to bulk
NGS data, or single omics data only. With tons of omics data being generated within and beyond the Common
Fund data sets (e.g., GTEx and HuBMAP), we hypothesize that integration of single-cell and bulk multi-omics
data including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics data will significantly facilitate subtype-specific
biomarker discovery and boost the accuracy of lung cancer subtype identification. To address these concerns,
we propose to develop an integrated machine learning (ML) framework for accurate and cost-effective
lung cancer subtype identification by combining single-cell and bulk multi-omics data within and beyond
Common Fund data sets. To achieve this, two specific aims are undertaken. Aim 1, to establish a gene-
signature-transfer ML model that leverages large-scale bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data within and
beyond Common Fund data sets for lung cancer subtype identification. Besides identifying well-annotated lung
cancer subtypes, we will also explore novel lung cancer subtypes by detecting rare cell types from large-scale
single cell data, from which cluster-specific and rare-cell-type specific gene signatures can be transferred to the
bulk transcriptomics data for improving performance of lung cancer subtype identification. Aim 2, to develop a
multi-omics integration framework to systematically combine single-cell and bulk multi-omics data (including
genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) to further boost lung cancer subtype identification. Our model is flexible
to tackle cases when only partial or incomplete multi-omics data are available for new patients. We believe
successful completion of this study will have direct impacts on improving downstream lung cancer risk
stratification, facilitating diagnosis and prognosis, and optimizing treatment selection. We also expect that our
proposed framework in this study can be customized and extensible to identifying subtypes of other types of
cancer."

70,000 deaths yearly (2). In the U.S. the virus is believed to be endemic to swine herds with the virus making
its way into the commercial food supply (3, 4). Genotype 3 HEV is increasingly being seen as a pathogen
afflicting immunocompromised populations including those with HIV, cancer, and solid organ transplant (SOT)
recipients (5-9) and mortality can reach up to 30% in pregnant women (10) . Currently chronic HEV patients are
treated with reduction of immunosuppression risking organ rejection in SOT patients or with ribavirin therapy.
There have been reported incidents of ribavirin failure both during and post treatment leading to poor patient
outcomes and ribavirin is contraindicated during pregnancy (11-13). Additionally, single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) have been identified from ribavirin treatment failure that enhance HEV replication (14). New therapeutics
that specifically target HEV, are amenable to treating at risk populations, and prevent complications such as
organ rejection while combatting the emergence of new ribavirin resistant HEV strains are essential to improving
outcomes in HEV patients. Emerging technologies such as CRISPR/Cas13 which can specifically target and
degrade viral RNA along with liver targeting nanoparticles may be an ideal tool to treat HEV infections. Our
proposal will test rationally designed CRISPR RNA targets for efficacy using a newly developed cell culture
system from our laboratory followed by studies on efficient liver targeting of the therapeutic using cutting edge
lipid nanoparticle technologies in a natural host pig model. If successful, these new technologies could be placed
into clinical trials as new therapies to combat HEV infection."

The burden of climate change is of particular concern to American Indian, rural, and agricultural populations.
While a considerable amount of research has evaluated climate effects in urban and coastal populations,
largely due to more abundant data, less is available for rural populations, where there are persistent healthcare
inequities and deficient health infrastructure. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive health outcomes data at a
population level has limited the evaluation of climate factors such as extreme weather, air pollution, and
drought in specific vulnerable groups that are difficult to identify. The burden of climate change is of particular
concern to American Indian persons. The historical systematic destruction of their communities and cultural
connection to natural systems creating a condition of ecological grief, i.e., grief due to loss or deterioration of
land, is believed to be linked to mental health conditions, substance use, obesity, and chronic health
conditions. This project will establish the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and Health (M3CH). Mni Sota is
the Dakota word for ‘where the waters reflect the sky’, which well describes the Upper Midwest. The long-term
objective of the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and Health is to be a leading research enterprise to
characterize health impacts related to climate change and translate findings to create practical and actionable
measures for climate change adaptation with a specific focus on American Indian and rural communities. The
objective of this proposal is to develop regional climate and health research capacity through the M3CH by
leveraging the multidisciplinary assets of the University of Minnesota, partner institutions, and communities to
create actionable knowledge for addressing the health impacts of a changing climate in the Upper Midwest.
The primary focus of the proposed center is to develop capacity to address the impacts of climate change
experienced by American Indian persons and people living in rural areas with an emphasis on populations in
the Mni Sota region. The Specific Aims of the proposed center are to; 1) Leverage multidisciplinary expertise
and partnerships to build regional capacity for research on climate change and health that aligns with the
priorities of target communities. 2)Establish a Community Engagement Core to co-develop a research agenda
with American Indian and rural communities that will guide future research using novel and existing data while
following culturally safe research practices. 3)Support a research project that will develop climate change and
health research capacity using a novel data resource based on a multi-system electronic health records
consortium to evaluate the effects of extreme weather events in at risk communities and specifically American
Indian and rural populations. 4)Establish a Pilot Project and Emerging Issues program that identifies and
responds to stakeholder priorities in the co-developed research agenda and creates partnerships that will
rapidly progress toward substantial research projects."

 Host defense responses by the mammalian immune system can be very potent but require
exquisite spatio-temporal coordination. This coordination is essential to match the immune activity
to the specific threat, to monitor and regulate the immune response, minimize damage to normal
tissues, and terminate the response when the hazard is eliminated. Stimulator of interferon genes
(STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated signaling protein that is essential for
transcriptional regulation of numerous host defense genes against malignant cells. STING is
activated by 2’, 3’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), an
endogenous secondary messenger, which is produced by cGAMP synthase (cGAS) in response
to cytosolic DNA as a danger signal. Despite potent antitumor activities demonstrated by STING
agonists in preclinical studies, early clinical trials have yet to show significant antitumor response
in cancer patients. Current STING agonist designs are ‘always ON’, leading to on-target, off-tumor
toxicity in healthy tissues. The proposed R35 program will integrate four areas of research to
harness this important natural defense mechanism and innovate a safe and efficacious STING-
targeted therapy for immune-resistant cancers. In nanotechnology, we will design and synthesize
a (pH-hypoxia) AND logic nanoparticle STING agonist that stays protected in normal tissues but
will be activated in response to acidic pH and hypoxia signals inherent in the tumor
microenvironment. This ensures minimal toxicity in healthy tissues, while promoting targeted
STING activation within malignancies. In STING signaling, we will employ cryo-electron
microscopy to investigate the synergy of PSC7A with cGAMP for STING binding and activation.
In dendritic cell biology, we will investigate STING-mediated transformation of hematopoietic
progenitor cells into conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), and define its ramifications on
antitumor immunity. In immune-oncology, we will employ patient-derived tumor fragments to probe
into STING agonists' roles in immune resistant tumors. Furthermore, we will assess the prognostic
value of the STING-cDC1 signature in forecasting therapeutic responses to treatments like
STING-targeted interventions and checkpoint blockade therapies. Through our bench-to-clinic
and back-to-bench approach, our goal is to pinpoint the barriers that have stymied effective
targeting of this crucial biological pathway, and ultimately apply these insights to establish a
successful STING-targeted therapy in cancer patients unresponsive to current treatments."

 The Intersectional Substance Use & Lived Analysis (ISLA) lab, is dedicated to developing a novel
framework for community-directed research approaches that seeks to reduce intersectional (race/ethnicity +
sexual orientation) and intergenerational inequities in (commercial) tobacco use (TU) among Black & Latine
young adult sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). SGM adults experience heightened TU, with racial/ethnic
SGMs exhibiting elevated TU compared to their racial/ethnic heterosexual peers. Efforts to redress intersectional
stigma is currently constrained in two significant ways: 1) overwhelming foci on individual-level measurement
without identification of useful empowering strategies that mitigate individual-level stressors/harms and 2) lacking
evidence illuminating how intersectional stigma constrains organizational capacity of community-based
organizations (CBOs) historically serving those experiencing harmful TU. CBOs serving racial/ethnic SGM adults
with heightened TU behaviors, and whose leadership historically has been led by racial minorities (e.g.,
HIV/AIDS service organizations), have not experienced enhanced R&D growth capacity on par with CBOs
serving similar populations but with non-racially minoritized leadership. Such client-service provider racial
disconcordance (R/D) has been linked to elevated mistrust, although such evidence within harm-reduction
settings warrants greater clarity. We hypothesize that multilevel empowerment strategies
(individual+organizational) is positively associated with decreases in TU/motivations among Black & Latine adult
SGM Philadelphians. The current project combines inventive community-directed design and measurement
strategies to investigate multilevel influences of empowerment in mitigating the harms of TU among racial/ethnic
SGM adults. Guided by a 13-member Community Advisory Council, we will use a community-driven systems
dynamic modeling process to identify significant multilevel intersectional drivers shaping TU/motivations among
clients served by a BIPOC queer/trans urban CBO (n=30). Second, we evaluate how empowerment, resulting
from direct policy engagement, can disrupt TU/motivations among clients with smoking histories, using expanded
notions of intergenerational familial composition germane collected via surveys. Third, we will develop/assess
the psychometric properties of a new organizational-level metric of intersectional stigma (n=488). Fourth, we will
identify unique drivers of organizational empowerment, augmenting the R&D environment, to uncover new
strategies for combating racial/ethnic inequities in TU. Lastly, we collect longitudinal (t=4, 3-month intervals: 24
clients/16 providers) qualitative multilevel data to better understand racialized dimensions of medical mistrust
within harm-reduction settings, uncovering strategies to improve challenges arising from client-provider R/D in
harm-reduction settings. These five components synergistically contribute to the development of the first
empirically measureable framework of successful community-directed tobacco harm reduction (THR) research;
a framework needed to achieve multiple crosscutting issues outlined within NIDA's Racial Equity Action Plan."
10986293,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is a key risk factor for several types of cancer. Development of healthy weight and eating behaviors
during childhood has the potential to reduce cancer risk in adulthood. Preadolescence is a key risk period, as
children become more independent in their food choices and eating behaviors. Non-homeostatic eating, i.e.,
eating that occurs in response to external cues rather than physiological need, increases in preadolescence
and is a risk factor for obesity. Individual differences in interoception, the process by which internal bodily
states, like hunger and fullness, are sensed, integrated, interpreted, and regulated, may contribute to
propensity for non-homeostatic eating. A number of studies have found that children with obesity have poorer
interoceptive awareness than children without obesity, but studies examining the relationship between
interoception and eating behavior are lacking. Furthermore, it is unknown if obesity-related impairments in
interoception are due to inadequate physiological signaling of internal states (‘bottom up’ processes) and/or
impaired cognitive interpretation of these signals (‘top down’ regulation). Levels of ghrelin, a hunger hormone
produced by the stomach, typically peak just before a meal and decline following food intake; however, this
response to food intake is blunted in individuals with obesity. Altered ghrelin secretion in response to a meal
may result in incorrect interoceptive signaling to the brain. The primary goals of this R21 are to better
understand how individual differences in multiple features of interoception contribute to objectively-measured
non-homeostatic eating in children. To do this, children age 7-10 years with or without obesity (n=60) will
complete a series of questionnaire and laboratory-based behavioral measures of interoception. On a separate
occasion, children will consume an ad libitum meal followed by a non-homeostatic eating task (Eating in the
Absence of Hunger [EAH]), providing saliva samples for measurement of ghrelin and leptin before, during, and
after these tasks. For Aim 1, we will determine if interoception is associated with kcal intake in the EAH task;
we hypothesize interoception will be inversely associated with intake. For Aim 2, we will examine salivary
ghrelin and leptin as interoceptive signals of hunger/satiety; we hypothesize that children with greater
postprandial ghrelin suppression will have better interoceptive awareness and will eat less in the EAH task,
and that elevated leptin will attenuate the relationship between ghrelin suppression and interoception. For Aim
3 (Exploratory) we will use cluster analysis identify profiles of interoception based on global and system-
specific (e.g., cardiac, gastric) interoception, and then examine differences in eating behavior, executive
function, and weight between clusters. This project will extend our understanding of the drivers of non-
homeostatic eating and reveal how interoceptive awareness impacts food intake, setting the foundation for
intervention strategies tailored for children based on individual differences in interoceptive function."

The goal of this proposal is to enable a comprehensive modernization of an aging system in the shared
zebrafish research facility in Bevis Hall at the Ohio State University. The modernization proposal will align the
capabilities of the zebrafish facility with modern demands on zebrafish science and increase capabilities to
allow affiliated researchers to consider experiments that were previously unattainable. The zebrafish facility in
Bevis Hall houses the fish of three core- and five additional users. The research supported by this facility spans
neural development, heart regeneration, systems neuroscience, cancer research and nutrition.
The renovation will allow automatic monitoring and control of critical water parameters and automatic feeding.
These advances will increase research reproducibility, reduce waste, and dramatically shorten generation time.
The expected reduction in size and growth variability of adult and juvenile zebrafish will allow for new research
avenues in these stages. The decrease in time from hatching to sexual maturity of zebrafish will increase the
amount of generated transgenic and mutant fish available to researchers at The Ohio State University and
beyond. The proposed modernization will also centralize water filtration and eliminate food-waste, reducing the
environmental footprint of the facility. Increasing the reproducibility of experiments through better controlled
feeding and water parameters will allow reducing the amount of animals used in experiments."

Neuroinflammatory processes are increasingly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases. The
blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical modulator of peripheral inflammatory influences on brain development and
function. Co-PIs Jorge Alvarez, a neuroimmunologist with expertise in the BBB, and Stewart Anderson, a
developmental neurobiologist with expertise in mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders, have recently
demonstrated that the BBB is compromised in a relatively common genetic cause of neuropsychiatric illness, the
22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS). While this finding in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB-like
cells (iBBB) and in 22qDS mice was initially ascribed at least partially to haploinsufficiency of the BBB-enriched
tight junction protein claudin-5, work from the Anderson lab and others has also demonstrated that 22qDS is
associated with mitochondrial energetic compromise in various cell types. Since mitochondrial energetics are
also necessary for optimal BBB function, the PIs initiated experiments to determine whether mitochondrial
energetics of the BBB are compromised in 22qDS, whether this compromise is likely to influence BBB
dysfunction in this disorder, and whether correction of mitochondrial weakness improves BBB dysfunction in
22qDS. Remarkably, our preliminary data suggest that the answer to all three possibilities is yes.
 Here, we propose to study the synergistic influences of structural and energetic compromise on BBB
function. As we have previously found in iPSC-derived neurons and transformed blood cells that the presence
of 22qDS with schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with weaker mitochondrial energetics than 22qDS without SZ or
non-deleted controls, in Aim 1 we will assess whether this association of mitochondrial weakness and the
presence of SZ in 22qDS extends to iBBB cells. We will also examine whether interventions that enhance
mitochondrial energetics improve BBB function, both in the 22qDS iBBB, and in 22qDS model mice. In Aim 2
we will use the more reduced system of mice heterozygous only for claudin-5, and selectively in the BBB, that
have been shown to have a moderate neurovascular deficit. We will test whether crosses of these mice with
those lacking the mitochondrial-DNA encoded gene ND6 will have exacerbated BBB dysfunction relative to each
mutation alone. We will also test whether enhancing mitochondrial energetics pharmacologically will rectify BBB
dysfunction in the neurovascular selective claudin-5 +/- mice.
 In sum, the mitochondrial influence on BBB function is an underexplored area of study. Since these
influences are therapeutically targetable and since the BBB's influence on neuroinflammation and brain health
is increasingly appreciated, this proposal could lead to important novel therapeutics both within and beyond the
22qDS context."

There is a fundamental gap in the availability of cognitive outcome measures that are reliable and sensitive to
detecting change among children with Down syndrome (DS). Lack of such outcome measures represents an
important problem to interpreting clinical trials aimed at improving the lives of individuals with DS. Without
evidence-based cognitive outcome measures, future treatment trials in this population will remain suboptimal
due to poor study measures. Despite some promising findings in currently recommended assessment
batteries, the evidence base for cognitive outcome measures in DS is limited. Multi-site studies evaluating the
reliability and validity of outcome measures are the needed next step towards supporting the evaluation of new
pharmaceutical and clinical interventions for children with DS. Working groups convened by NICHD of leading
experts in DS led to recommendations of promising measures for use in this population. The prior R01
HD093754 began evaluating the psychometric properties of recommended promising measures and expanded
upon those recommendations by evaluating individual variability and accounting for the method of assessment
(verbal, nonverbal, computer, parent-report) to support our understanding of performance within a cognitive
domain. The proposed renewal continues evaluating the psychometric properties of measures that fill the gaps
in cognitive domains (Study 1), extends the natural history of change in performance on measures with annual
follow-up visits (Study 2), and refines the measurement of individual variability to include co-occurring medical
and mental health conditions across both Studies. The overall objective of this application is to establish the
psychometric properties of individual clinical outcome measures in children with DS across the cognitive
domains of episodic memory, executive functioning (set-shifting, inhibitory control, working memory), learning
and memory, and processing speed. Our rationale for working with this population is that DS is associated with
a distinct pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses related to their neuroanatomy. Thus, the selection of
outcome measures to be evaluated needs to take into account the DS behavioral phenotype. We propose
three specific aims: 1) To examine the psychometric properties of selected cognitive outcome measures with
children with DS. 2) To evaluate differences in the psychometric properties of the measures as a function of
variations in demographics and co-occurring medical and mental health conditions. 3) To characterize the
developmental trajectories of cognition and executive functioning. To achieve these aims, 200 children in Study
1 ages 6-17 years with DS will participate in repeated neuropsychological assessments with follow-up
evaluations at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. We will continue to follow at minimum 120 children from R01
HD093754 annually in Study 2. We anticipate that this measurement study will provide critical guidance for
future efficacy and effectiveness trials. Our goals are in line with the programmatic objective of the INCLUDE
project to assemble a large cohort of individuals, perform deep phenotyping, and study co-existing conditions."

 Syphilis infection remains endemic among adults worldwide. Rates are rising among women of childbearing
age in the U.S., resulting in a concomitant increase in congenital syphilis cases. Untreated congenital syphilis
can result in permanent neurologic impairments and osteoarticular deformities. Although some infants have
clinical symptoms at birth, many are asymptomatic at delivery. For these asymptomatic, syphilis-exposed infants,
diagnostic testing does not reliably identify those with true congenital infection. Because of this, a large number
of syphilis-exposed infants undergo extensive diagnostic testing, are treated with antibiotics, and require long-
term outpatient follow-up. Tests to discriminate infected infants from those who are exposed but uninfected are
necessary to improve clinical management.
 Our group has a longstanding interest in congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and we have shown
that infants with congenital CMV infection have evidence of global immunologic activation in peripheral blood
that differs markedly from the naïve immune signatures of uninfected neonates. These differences encompass
the whole blood transcriptional profiles, differentiation and activation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets,
and serum cytokine profiles. Importantly, the immune profile of congenital CMV is observed among both
symptomatic and asymptomatically infected infants and is significantly different from uninfected infants. Human
immune responses to congenital syphilis infection are largely unstudied, but responses in adults and animal
models show monocyte activation and sustained B and T cell responses.
 In this project we will test the hypothesis that infants with congenital syphilis infection express markers
of global immune activation that distinguish them from healthy, uninfected infants and syphilis-exposed,
uninfected infants. Aim 1 will identify characteristics of innate and adaptive immune responses to congenital
syphilis among an established cohort of infants with symptomatic congenital syphilis infection using advanced
CITE-seq and flow cytometry immunophenotyping methods, which will greatly expand our limited understanding
of congenital syphilis immunopathogenesis. Leukocyte markers expressed during congenital syphilis infection
will then be applied to an enrolled cohort of asymptomatic, syphilis-exposed infants to determine if these
immunologic signatures can distinguish their likelihood of having congenital infection. Aim 2 will establish serum
cytokine and chemokine profiles induced by congenital syphilis and apply this profile to asymptomatic, syphilis-
exposed infants to discern their likelihood of congenital syphilis infection. As an exploratory objective, biomarkers
from Aims 1 and 2 will be synthesized to generate an immune profile for likelihood of congenital infection among
asymptomatic, syphilis-exposed infants that can be tested in future studies. Together, these data will provide
new insights into the immunopathogenesis of congenital syphilis infection and seek to identify potential
biomarkers to discern likelihood of congenital infection among asymptomatic, syphilis-exposed infants."

There is an unmet medical need to develop new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Brain
lymphatic vasculature is (re)discovered at the interface between skull and brain (meninges) and is a pathogenic
factor for AD. We recently found that meningeal lymphatic dysfunction drives neurocognitive defects in
craniosynostosis disorder and established three independent approaches to activate brain lymphatics (Cell,
2021, PMID: 33417861; Cell Stem Cell, 2023, PMID: 37863055). The goal of this proposal is to determine
whether craniosynostosis is a risk factor for AD and how our multiplex brain lymphatic activation approaches can
be re-deployed to mitigate AD. These three approaches include the transcranial delivery of VEGF-C recombinant
protein, intra-cisterna magna (i.c.m.) injection of AAV1-VEGF-C gene, and MSC implantation. They are derived
from our investigation of skull-brain communication via skull mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and meningeal
lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) crosstalk in health and craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is a major
craniofacial skull disorder characterized by the premature skull bone fusion due to suture MSC loss coupled with
neurocognitive defects. Our meningeal lymphatic investigation in Twist1+/- craniosynostosis mice provides a
foundational framework for structural and functional studies of brain lymphatics. Further mechanistic studies
revealed that skull MSCs directly promote LEC growth via VEGF-C signaling. Preliminary data identified an
abnormal buildup of amyloid β in Twist1+/- mouse brain, which is further exacerbated in the background of 5xFAD
mouse model of AD. We are in a unique position to re-deploy these discoveries and multiplex tools to promote
brain lymphatics as a therapeutic treatment for AD. We hypothesize that craniosynostosis is a risk factor for AD
due to its impaired meningeal lymphatics, and lymphatic activation by multiplex approaches can promote brain
fluid homeostasis and waste clearance, mitigating AD-like pathologies and behaviors. The successful outcome
of this study will determine the efficacy of individual brain lymphatic activation approaches in promoting brain
fluid homeostasis and waste clearance to mitigate AD pathogenesis."
10982446,"Background: This is a time of unprecedented loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness in particular is
a powerful predictor of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, functional decline, and death. Loneliness can
and should be addressed by health systems. Due to risk for loneliness and negative health outcomes, a
group of particular concern is older adults with medical or psychiatric comorbidity who have limited
treatment engagement. Caring Contacts is an intervention that can address loneliness and poor
treatment engagement. However, it has only been evaluated in a narrow population of psychiatric
patients and not examined amongst patients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other disasters.
Significance: This project addresses VA’s top clinical priority (suicide prevention), an overarching
priority of the Office of Research and Development (clinical trials), and multiple Health Service
Research and Development priority areas, including social determinants of health, aging, access to
care, mental health, suicide prevention, and population/whole health. The impact of this project is very
high because it will advance scientific understanding of key gaps related to the mechanisms and
outcomes of Caring Contacts, while also evaluating a timely, pragmatic, low-cost, and scalable
intervention for Veterans affected by lack of social connection and treatment engagement. If effective, it
will have applicability as a response to treatment disengagement and future disasters.
Innovation and Impact: We have taken an empirically-grounded suicide prevention intervention and
adapted it for Veterans with poor treatment engagement in VA outpatient care. This study is innovative
in testing an intervention responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, and unique in using
a health services intervention strategy to target loneliness. The intervention’s peer support component
is highly novel for its low resource demands and potential for scalability.
Specific Aims: The overarching objective of this project is to evaluate “Crisis Caring Contacts” (CCC),
an adaptation of Caring Contacts tailored to reduce loneliness in the context of the pandemic. To reach
this objective we will achieve these aims: 1) Among older Veterans with poor treatment engagement,
evaluate the effectiveness of Crisis Caring Contacts in decreasing loneliness, compared to enhanced
usual care; 2) Evaluate the effect of Crisis Caring Contacts on other important outcomes, including
treatment engagement and suicidal ideation; 3) Explore potential moderators of treatment response to
Crisis Caring Contacts; and 4) Explore the effect of Crisis Caring Contacts on all-cause mortality and
suicide attempts.
Methodology: Our approach is to conduct a multisite, pragmatic randomized controlled trial of CCC.
We will target Veterans age 60 and over with active psychiatric or medical diagnoses who have had
limited treatment engagement in VA outpatient care. Those in the CCC treatment arm will be sent 10
postcards over 10 months by a Peer Support Specialist. Those in the enhanced usual care arm
(control) will be sent non-personalized, general health resource information. We will examine self-report
and administrative data outcomes over 24 months of follow-up.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will collect pre-implementation data from our study sites and share
this with our operational partner, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP). Crisis
Caring Contacts is highly suited to future implementation due to its scalability, ease of creating an
operational dashboard to identify Veterans who could receive the intervention, and ability to add study
materials to an implementation toolkit for VA Caring Contacts interventions."

The goal of this R01 proposal is to advance our understanding of the genetic regulatory mechanisms
underlying the newly identified loci associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), with the ultimate goal of
enabling earlier prevention and treatment of the disease. Our research team comprises individuals from
multiple areas of medical research, including high-throughput genetics, computational and statistical genetics,
and cardiovascular disease biology. Building upon our past research endeavors centered on coronary artery
disease and myocardial infarction, our focus is now to uncover the biological mechanisms that underscore
genetic loci linked to AAA, employing a combination of genetics, bioinformatics, as well as cell culture and
animal models. During the previous funding period, we have played a crucial role in the Million Hearts Initiative,
Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Genetics (AAAGen) Consortium,
and a substantial collaboration studying the genetics of atrial fibrillation. In this application, we have outlined
two specific aims: In Aim 1, we propose to combine the meta-analysis efforts from AAAGen and GBMI to
increase the sample size for candidate gene discovery related to AAA. We will fine-map the associated loci to
novel causal genes using bioinformatic tools, together with multi-omics data from abdominal aorta tissue, to
prioritize genes for biological follow-up studies. In Aim 2, we plan to define the functions of TCF7L2 within
vascular smooth muscle cells, and additionally, elucidate the functional roles of 2 to 5 newly identified
candidate genes from Aim 1, in the development of AAA. The accomplishment of these aims will provide
invaluable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying AAA and will reveal novel gene targets that hold
promise for the better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AAA."

Skeletal homeostasis reflects a balanced state of bone remodeling, requiring a combination of osteoclast-
dependent bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. In turn, pathologic bone remodeling
precipitates a variety of bone-destructive disease states, ranging from osteoporosis to rheumatoid arthritis. In
addition to the traditional role of osteoclasts as ""bone eaters"", these cells also participate in the maintenance of
bone homeostasis via the release of signaling molecules that establish crosstalk with osteoblast-lineage cells.
Despite advances in the field, however, the molecular mechanisms that allow osteoclasts to both degrade and
induce new bone formation in a timely fashion remain to be defined. In new studies, we have found that cathepsin
K (Ctsk)-null osteoclasts dramatically upregulate expression of the membrane-anchored matrix
metalloproteinase, Mmp14/MT1-MMP, raising the possibility that, working together, the two proteinases play a
previously unrecognized role in regulating osteoclast function. As such, we generated myeloid-specific Csf1r-
Cre/Mmp14f/f/Ctskf/f mice where we find that the double knockout (DKO) mice unexpectedly display striking
increases in bone mass and osteogenic coupling activity relative to myeloid-specific cathepsin K-null (CtskΔM/ΔM)
or Mmp14-null (Mmp14ΔM/ΔM) mice. Further, the up-regulated bone formation parameters observed in these mice
occur while leaving bone resorptive activity comparable to that found in CtskΔM/ΔM mice. In an effort to define the
mechanisms underlying a combined requirement for Mmp14 and Ctsk in osteoclast-mediated bone coupling
activity, the transcriptome of DKO osteoclasts reveals unexpected alterations in TGFβ receptor signaling in
tandem with the decreased expression of the tetraspanin family member, Tspan4. These findings led us to posit
a new model wherein Mmp14 and Ctsk co-regulate the TGFβ/Smad-dependent control of Tspan4 whose
expression directs the formation of osteoclast migrasomes, a new type of organelle/extracellular vesicle
deposited by migrating cells. Further, we provide supporting evidence that wild-type osteoclast-derived
migrasomes negatively regulate skeletal stem/progenitor cell recruitment and osteoblastogenesis, thereby
preventing premature or unrestrained bone formation. In turn, migrasome-deficient DKO osteoclasts create
conditions permissive for excessive osteogenesis and bone formation. Given these preliminary findings, we
propose to i) characterize the cooperative role played by a new Mmp14/Ctsk couplet in controlling osteoclast-
mediated osteogenic bone coupling functions in vitro and in vivo, utilizing both myeloid- and osteoclast-specific
conditional knockout mice; ii) define a novel Mmp14/Ctsk-TGF-β/Smad-Tspan4 axis that regulates osteoclast
migrasome formation and bone coupling activity in vitro and in vivo, and iii) identify the osteoclast-derived
migrasome component(s) that control osteoblastogenic recruitment and commitment of skeletal stem/progenitor
cells. The proteolytic/bone coupling synergy outlined herein should provide new insights into bone remodeling
while advancing the search for improved therapeutic interventions designed to prevent pathologic bone loss."

Fifteen years after passage of the HITECH Act resulted in investment of billions of dollars into electronic health
record (EHR) adoption, physicians and health system leaders face competing pressures related to the EHR.
On one hand, widespread adoption of EHRs has had positive effects for patient safety and quality of care. On
the other hand, use of EHRs has significantly worsened the physician work experience, particularly for primary
care physicians (PCPs). In the context of ongoing threats to both the US primary care workforce and primary
care quality and sustainability, health system leaders struggle to identify interventions that contribute to
improved primary care quality while also enhancing PCPs’ EHR interactions and wellbeing.
To address this gap, and in response to SEN-HS-22-011, we will evaluate the impact of three common or
promising EHR-optimization interventions that are often considered and offered by health system leaders and
adopted by primary care clinics and PCPs, either individually or in combination: 1) scribes, 2) advanced team-
based inbox messaging support, and 3) artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted inbox messaging support. At present,
health system leaders lack robust, actionable evidence on the benefits and drawbacks of these interventions,
including their impact on patients’ quality of care and their relative cost effectiveness. Leveraging data and
insights from three community-based and three academic primary care practice networks representing 800
PCPs caring for 1 million patients at 210 practice sites, we will: 1) test for associations between use of the 3
EHR-optimization interventions, individually or in combination, with PCPs’ EHR time and wellbeing, and
patient-panel level quality of care and utilization of care; 2) describe PCP and team member experiences of
adopting the 3 EHR-optimization interventions and the mechanisms by which the interventions are associated
with EHR time, physician wellbeing, and quality and utilization of care; and 3) quantify the costs to health
systems of implementing each of the 3 EHR-optimization interventions, either individually or in combination.
This study blends quantitative, qualitative, and cost effectiveness methods to generate information about how
to enhance PCPs’ EHR work while maintaining or enhancing quality of care. It brings together a strong,
interdisciplinary team of experts in primary care operations, quality of care, informatics, EHR activity log
research, and the clinician experience to generate rigorous evidence for healthcare leaders and policymakers
regarding the impact of EHR-optimization interventions across PCP and patient outcomes. It will additionally
generate evidence about the cost effectiveness of these interventions. The results of this study will guide
health systems leaders towards interventions that both address EHR-based challenges negatively impacting
the PCP work experience and maximize benefits of EHRs for physicians, patients, and health systems."

in causal genetic variant discovery and limiting the resolution of findings. The status quo persists due to the
lacking of data and the unavailability of suitable methods. Several large international genetic projects, including
PUMAS and A-BIG-NET, have recently launched to target non-European populations and make data more
accessible. The absence of proper fine-mapping methods for populations with complex genetic structures is a
significant hindrance in the field.
 The candidate proposes to address gaps between the forthcoming data and appropriate methods by
developing a suite of open-source statistical methods and publicly available analytical resources. The candidate
will: 1) develop a local-ancestry-aware admixed population fine-mapping method, enabling the fine-mapping of
entire chromosome data by optimizing the algorithm and effectively managing memory; 2) develop a burden test
approach to prioritize putative causal genes for psychiatric disorders by fine-mapping the gene-based burden of
Neanderthal introgressed sequences; 3) develop the most inclusive fine-mapping method for psychiatric
disorders by integrating fine-mapped results across diverse ancestries.
 The proposed research and training plan was carefully designed to confer expertise in four domains: 1)
psychiatric genetics and psychiatric phenotyping, 2) statistical methods development and software engineering,
3) large-scale Blended Genome and Exome (BGE) sequencing data analysis, 4) admixed population genomic
data analysis, and 5) professional development. These skills are fundamental to the candidate’s goal of
becoming a leading investigator who develops and applies statistical methods to understand underlying causal
genetic factors for psychiatric disorders. In addition to research training, the candidate will take coursework to
gain greater expertise in statistical method development, participate in regular seminars, attend workshops and
conferences, and gain mentorship and teaching experience. All research will be conducted in the Analytic and
Translational Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute with mentorship from
renowned scientists Drs. Hailiang Huang, Tian Ge and Jordan Smoller. Additional guidance from leading experts
Drs. Benjamin Neale, Kenneth Kendler, Xiaofeng Zhu, and Elizabeth Atkinson will ensure exceptional guidance
and support. Overall, the training environment is outstanding, the mentors and advisors are world-class, the
proposed studies address an urgent unmet need, and the additional skills gained in this award will poise the
candidate to establish independent leadership in inclusive fine-mapping analysis for psychiatric disorders."
10984679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polypharmacy, usually defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications, occurs in over 90% of nursing
home (NH) residents with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Prescribing cascades are a key
driver of inappropriate polypharmacy. A prescribing cascade occurs when adverse events from one medication
(the “precipitant medication”) are misinterpreted as manifestations of a new medical condition, resulting in the
addition of another unnecessary medication to manage symptoms (the “resultant medication”). Because the
underlying cause of the adverse event is never resolved and a new medication with additional risks is started,
prescribing cascades may result in adverse outcomes such as hospitalizations, injurious falls, decreased
physical and cognitive function, and death. Our research team’s preliminary data suggest over 50% of NH
residents may experience prescribing cascades. There is a severe lack of evidence on the causal effects of
prescribing cascades on health outcomes in NH residents, especially those with ADRD, who are at high risk of
polypharmacy and its adverse effects. To optimize prescribing and deprescribing, it is essential to generate
evidence on prescribing cascades and their effects among NH residents with and without ADRD. Without
additional evidence, providers will be unable to identify clinically significant prescribing cascades that could be
intervened on to improve NH resident health outcomes. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to
understand how prescribing cascades arise in NH residents and to quantify their effects on outcomes. Our central
hypothesis is that prescribing cascades increase the risks of adverse health outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations,
decreased physical function, fall-related injuries, mortality) and the risks will be greatest among residents with
severe cognitive impairment. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: Aim 1, Identify risk
factors for clinically relevant prescribing cascades among NH residents with and without ADRD; Aim 2, Estimate
the effect of precipitant medication use on subsequent resultant medication use among NH residents with and
without ADRD; and Aim 3, Quantify the effects of the prescribing cascades on adverse outcomes among all
older adults in NHs and those in high-risk subgroups. To accomplish the proposed aims, we will leverage a large
innovative database of NH electronic health record information linked to national Minimum Data Set clinical
assessment records, Medicare health insurance claims, and other relevant datasets. We will also innovate by
developing the use of novel causal inference approaches, including sequential target trial emulation and doubly
robust estimation methods, for studying prescribing cascades and other related exposures. The proposed
research is highly significant because it will provide clinically actionable empirical evidence to help guide the
prescribing, deprescribing, and management of medications to minimize the risk of important prescribing
cascades and adverse outcomes among NH residents with ADRD. This proposal is directly responsive to PAR-
22-093 and advances the National Institute on Aging’s Strategic Goal C to improve the safe use of medications."

Here, we propose a training program with two years of training to prepare the candidate for a successful transition
to independence, in the field of developing machine learning integration algorithms to predict undercharacterized
genomic and proteomic data.
The training plan is designed to guide the candidate's scientific and professional development, under the men-torship of Dr. Noble and guidance from five advisory committee members (Drs. Christine Disteche, Jay Shendure,
Brian Beliveau, Mike MacCoss, and Sheng Wang) at the University of Washington. The committee will help the
candidate extend their knowledge of proteomics, spatial imaging, and machine learning development.
The proposed research focuses on developing semi-supervised machine learning integration tools that can
predict the various types of single-cell profiles (e.g., chromatin accessibility, spatial locations, proteomics) from
known measurements (e.g., gene expression).
In Aim 1, we propose to computationally fill in the gap of single-cell time series snapshots to infer continuous
cellular profile changes, by building a conditional variational autoencoder model with continuous time representations.
The model will enable us to infer temporal maps of single cells in conditions with sparser time points
captured (e.g., a mouse mutational strain collected in another experiment, human embryonic development, chromatin
accessibility measurements).
In Aim 2, we will develop a semi-supervised joint machine learning model stitching together the conditional
variational autoencoder model and graph neural network to predict the physical locations of cells with dissociated
gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements.
In Aim 3, we will combine the semi-supervised framework with deep tensor factorization and use genomics
and bulk assays to infer single-cell proteomics profiles and identify genome-scale protein markers in single cells
with only gene expression profiles.
The research plan will generate computational tools to project single cells to their spatiotemporal contexts
and understand the protein mediators. The tools will be generally applicable to studies of complex biological
systems (e.g., embryonic development) and diseases (e.g., cancer). With the rapid development in single-cell
time-series, spatial imaging, and proteomics, we expect our methods to have increasing power for biological
knowledge detection."
10983858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of Dr. Wang’s proposal is to reduce the known risk of renal injury from febrile urinary tract
infection (fUTI) in children by implementing a practical, validated clinical decision support algorithm to promptly
identify unsafe anatomy before injury occurs. Dr. Wang’s proposal has identified significant care gaps in the
care of fUTI children. The long-term goal is to contribute to optimal management for fUTI in children through
implementation of novel, high-value, self-renewing machine learning (ML) models. The overall objective is to
identify those critical elements necessary for the development and implementation of predictive modeling to
identify children who would benefit most from early vs later voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) in primary care
(NOT-HS-22-011). The central hypothesis is that ML models can provide accurate prediction of risky fUTI, and
thus assist clinicians/families to choose the best timing for VCUG. The rationale is to offer a scientific roadmap
and pilot new strategies that incorporate and implement prediction models to provide true value-based care
(NOT-HS-19-011) and equitable resource utilization for children (NOT-HS-21-015, NOT-HS-21-014). This
hypothesis has been formulated based on Dr. Wang’s previous work that demonstrates 1) high variability in
post-UTI VCUG practice patterns; and 2) ML models can serve as a promising basis to reliably identify children
with high risk for damaging UTI. Leveraging the data from a large pediatric practice network within Boston
Children’s Hospital, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) assess determinants for successful ML
algorithm implementation for pediatric fUTI care, 2) prospectively collect data to optimize and validate novel ML
algorithms in fUTI children, 3) pilot prediction of pediatric fUTI algorithm implementation to iteratively testing,
implementing, and adapting the algorithm using the principles of implementation and behavioral science to
maximize adoption and sustained implementations. In this proposal, Dr. Wang has assembled a multi-
disciplinary mentorship team consisting of experts in, qualitative methods, informatics, infectious disease,
machine learning, implementation, and behavioral science to help him achieve his goals and has designed a
comprehensive training plan to acquire necessary expertise. Dr. Wang’s unique background combined with his
career development plan, and the rich supporting environment (Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard system,
and MIT) position him well to attain the proposed training goals and specific aims, and eventually lead to his
transition to independent surgeon-scientist. Combining machine-learning technology and real-life
implementation to tackle the challenge and change the status quo by translating actionable ML results to the
bedside is novel and innovative. The study is significant in that successful implementation of an algorithm for
UTI will be proof-of-concept to catalyze a similar approach to optimal clinical decision support for other
conditions. This work has broad impact and can be scaled to other institutions and conditions, facilitating
interactive improvements that empower clinicians and caregivers to meet the diverse clinical needs of children."

The proposed Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and Health (M3CH) will develop unique partnerships to
build research capacity related to the health impacts of climate change. The foundation of the M3CH is a
collaboration between three units at the University of Minnesota; the Division of Environmental Health
Sciences in the School of Public Health (EnHS), The Institute on the Environment, the School of Medicine
(SOM), and the Minnesota Electronic Health Records Consortium (MNEHRC). This collaboration brings
together expertise in epidemiology, exposure science, climate science, community based participatory
research, American Indian health and wellness, American Indian culture and governance, rural and agricultural
health, health care, health record systems, and community engagement. Leveraging these resources presents
a unique opportunity to build significant capacity in climate and health research. To maximize the potential of
this center and efficiently grow the center capacity the Administrative Core will be responsible for the following.
1. Facilitate communication and collaboration between the M3CH partners and external stakeholders, including
the External Advisory Board (EAB) to build capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the center. The EAB will
consist of members from different disciplines and sectors with an emphasis on representation from American
Indian and rural communities. The center will develop a process of regular internal and external
communication to build name recognition and a network of partners. 2. Develop and implement a strategic
plan that will leverage the assets of the M3CH and current and future partners to build capacity in climate and
health research. The strategic planning process will include short term goals to initiate the activities of the
center and longer term goals to establish a substantial and sustainable research portfolio. 3. Facilitate the
development of a substantial and sustainable climate and health research program that will extend the impact
of M3CH and facilitate career development of underrepresented researchers. This will include the
administration of a Pilot Project and Emerging Issues program to engage a diverse array of investigators. The
Pilot Project program will leverage the community informed research agenda developed by the Community
Engagement Core. 4. Track the progress of center activities to ensure goals are met. The Administrative Core
will focus on process evaluation while a more formal evaluation of impact and engagement will be administered
by the Community Engagement Core. 5. Ensure compliance with appropriate guidelines for research and
engagement, and specifically the University of Minnesota guidelines for Indigenous Research. 6. Create a data
infrastructure plan associated with projects with attention to data sovereignty. 7Ensure appropriate
management of center resources, activities, budgets, records, and reports. 8. Organize an annual symposium
to share the work of the center and engage current and future partners."
10981736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires are manifestations of a changing climate.
The Upper Midwest is particularly vulnerable to climatic shifts with Minnesota experiencing the most extreme
wintertime warming of any contiguous state. Climate impacts are regionally visible, as food sources culturally
important to indigenous tribes have diminished and transitory wildfire smoke events from Canada have
produced alarming air pollution events. The Upper Midwest is further home to historically underrepresented
populations, including rural and American Indian (AI) residents. These individuals experience some of the
largest U.S. health disparities, including higher comorbidities, outdoor and physical occupations, and persistent
structural inequities including a sparsity of rural healthcare access. Other unique risk factors may play
additional roles in modifying extreme heat health effects, including the use of climate-sensitive medications that
disrupt thermoregulation. To evaluate the impacts of extreme weather on high concern Upper Midwest
populations, we will partner with the Minnesota electronic health records consortium (MNEHR); a unique group
with 9 of the largest Minnesota health care providers giving us access to electronic health records for a near
complete capture of Minnesota’s population (61,000 AI individuals, ~2 million rural residents). This consortium
represents a key resource innovation, as it supports the identification and investigation of high disparity
populations while keeping data secure and private. Our team will further collaborate with our Community
Engagement Core to seek input on research with minoritized populations and ensure that any public health
findings are effective and culturally appropriate. In Aim 1, we will characterize the spatiotemporal variability of
extreme weather in the Upper Midwest and link weather events with sociodemographic data to identify
hotspots and at-risk communities. This database will become a public resource for people evaluating regional
climate change. In Aim 2, we will assess extreme weather impacts among high-climate concern American
Indian and rural residents in Minnesota. We will estimate the association between extreme heat, cold, wildfire
air pollution, and compound events of heat plus wildfire and heat plus drought and healthcare admissions for
cardiopulmonary, heat-related or fluid disorders, non-accidental injury, and mental health issues. In Aim 3, we
will assess how climate-sensitive medication may be a unique risk factor for modifying medical encounters
during extreme heat events. Patients prescribed diuretics, SLT2i inhibitors, and anticholinergics and may show
exacerbated health risks during extreme heat exposures. Our research will play a critical role in the Mni Sota
Center for Climate Change and Health by building Midwest climate and health research capacity, developing
new climate partnerships, and bringing together climate and health stakeholders for public health practice and
clinical decision. Our research framework will provide a blueprint for future analysis of climate, weather, and
health, including the translation of our work to new regional partners."

The central premise of the Community Engagement (CE) Core is that communities at greatest risk for negative
health consequences due to climate change are the same communities who will make the most profound
strides to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledges (ITEKs; also
referred to as Native Science) refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous communities over
millennia through their direct contact with the environment and has recently been recognized as having great
potential to be leveraged to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To date, much of the existing literature on
the capacity of ITEKs to inform efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change exists primarily outside of the
U.S. Additionally, and as reflected in the White House’s Commitment to Elevating Indigenous Knowledge in
Federal Policy, efforts are urgently needed to ensure American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN), as well as rural,
representatives are at the same table as researchers, clinicians, and policy makers who are discussing the
results and implications of research on climate and health. Through the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change
and Health we will build capacity for innovative research related to climate change and health as experienced
by the two communities who we posit will make the most profound strides to mitigate the impacts of climate
change: AIAN and rural communities. This will be achieved by centering ITEKs, conducting community
engagement with AIAN and rural communities, and by leveraging the multidisciplinary assets and expertise of
the University of Minnesota and our partner institutions. The objective of the CE Core is to co-develop, assist,
implement, and evaluate strategies that will catalyze the Center’s capacity to examine the impacts of climate
change on health and develop action-oriented solutions to protect AIAN and rural persons. The CE Core has
the following aims: Aim 1: Co-develop a research agenda that leverages ITEKs and Western environmental
health approaches that identifies a) key research questions related to climate change and health experienced
by American Indian and rural persons that can be prioritized in future research and b) data sovereignty
guidelines and other recommendations for culturally safe research practices; Aim 2: Assist Center efforts in
navigating climate- and health-related community engaged research by providing expertise in CE from
planning to dissemination and culturally safe research practices including data sovereignty; Aim 3: Implement a
Citizen Science Program that entails digital storytelling (a form of ITEKs) with AIAN youth; Aim 4: Evaluate the
Center’s reach and engagement efforts via a multi-pronged approach informed by the RE-AIM Framework,
Goodman Assessment of CE, and an Indigenous Evaluation entailing storytelling. The CE Core will be highly
impactful given that it represents a braiding together of Native and Western science and viewpoints, or two-
eyed seeing approaches, and will engage communities who we posit will make the most profound strides to
mitigate the impacts of climate change and allies representing researchers, clinicians, and policy makers."
10983676,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:
 The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), defined as Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis
(UC), remains elusive. Although genetic susceptibility plays a vital role in IBD, with over 250 GWAS risk loci, the
mechanisms underlying their genetic impact on IBD are still poorly understood. Our surprising discovery reveals
that 78 of the IBD susceptibility loci are positioned adjacent to long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), collectively
accounting for about 20% of genetic heritability. This insight is founded on a comprehensive understanding of
dsRNA editing and sensing mechanisms, supported by human genetic analyses. To prevent undesired immune
responses triggered by abundant cellular long dsRNAs, the ADAR1 protein performs adenosine-to-inosine (A-
to-I) RNA editing on cellular dsRNAs, marking them as ""self"" and preventing dsRNA-induced interferon (IFN)
responses. Notably, we observed that mice lacking ADAR1 RNA editing cannot survive, but exhibit full lifespan
upon eliminating the dsRNA sensor MDA5. Our recent work indicates that insufficient dsRNA editing is associ-
ated with presumed dsRNA-mediated inflammation in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including
IBD. We discovered that genetic regulatory variants of RNA editing, referred to as edQTLs, are highly enriched
in the GWAS susceptibility loci of common immune-related diseases, including IBD. Further, GWAS-defined risk
variants are linked to reduced levels of adjacent long dsRNAs, increasing their susceptibility to MDA5 activation.
In summary, these findings highlight a crucial role of dsRNA editing and sensing in IBD etiology.
 Our research objective is to develop effective approaches to systematically evaluate the genetic effects
of IBD risk variants on dsRNA editing, allowing construction and validation of a predictive polygenic model of
dsRNA-mediated disease risk, known as ""dsRNA burden"", in both colon enteroids and in vivo animal models.
First, we will leverage genetic data from IBD and edQTLs to prioritize dsRNA loci for IBD susceptibility. Subse-
quently, we will systematically assess how risk and protective alleles of IBD GWAS variants affect cis-linked
dsRNA editing, achieving direct functional validation of causality. Second, we will develop and validate a predic-
tive model to assess an individual's dsRNA burden, encapsulating dsRNA-associated IBD in patient-derived
enteroid lines. This model will aid in stratifying IBD patients, particularly those with impaired dsRNA editing and
heightened dsRNA sensing, contributing to MDA5-dependent chronic inflammation. Finally, we will recapitulate
a dsRNA burden system in an in vivo animal model to replicate inflammation and pathology in a native environ-
ment. In summary, this work bridges a significant knowledge gap in understanding the etiology of IBD and pro-
vide essential mechanistic insights and therapeutic potential for individuals with genetically dysregulated dsRNA
editing, leading to chronic IFN responses in IBD."

Since we discovered repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) RAN translation in 2011, we and
others have shown that RAN proteins accumulate in nine different expansion disorders. These
proteins, which can be expressed from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts,
accumulate in disease-relevant human tissues including spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8)
and Huntington disease (HD). We now have evidence that polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins
accumulate in a group of spinocebellar ataxias (SCA1, 2, 3, 6 and 7) in which the CAG·CTG
expansion mutations are located in polyGln open reading frames. Additionally, we have
developed AAV and small molecule approaches to inhibit RAN translation. We will use these
tools and genetic approaches to test our central hypotheses that RAN protein pathology is a
common feature shared across polyglutamine encoding CAG·CTG expansion disorders and
that inhibiting the PKR pathway will reduce RAN protein levels and mitigate disease.
We will address our central hypothesis in three specific aims (1) To test the hypothesis that
RAN proteins contribute to spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) caused by polyglutamine encoding
CAG·CTG repeat expansion mutations. (2) To test the hypothesis that SCA and HD RAN
proteins are toxic and PKR inhibition will decrease RAN protein levels and improve cellular
phenotypes in HD and SCA3 iPSC derived cells (3) : To test the hypothesis that RAN proteins
contribute to HD and SCA3 phenotypes in mice independent of polyGln effects using genetic
and pharmacological approaches. Taken together these specific aims will determine the
contribution of RAN proteins to HD,SCA3 and CAG·CTG repeat expansion disorders and
characterize PKR inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for this large class of
devastating repeat expansion diseases."

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a human tumor virus, is the causative agent of mononucleosis and immunoblastic
lymphomas. EBV is strongly associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC). Additionally, recent studies suggest that EBV has a pathogenic role with the onset of Multiple
Sclerosis (MS). Approximately 90% of the world’s population is infected with EBV, but most do not present
disease. However, for those that do develop EBV-related illness there remains no directed small molecule
therapy. EBV-triggered disease, causing debilitating illness and death, remains a world-wide problem.
Interestingly, EBV expresses a unique protein (BPLF1) that possesses deubiquitinating activity. BPFL1 is known
to regulate both cellular and viral target activities, yet it remains largely unstudied. Our work has implicated
BPLF1 in a wide range of viral and cellular processes including infectivity (90% reduction with knockout of
BPLF1), viral DNA replication, and DNA repair. Also we recently reported surprising new findings that knockout
of BPLF1 delays and reduces human B-cell immortalization and lymphoma formation in humanized mice. The
aim of this proposal is to discover and characterize the first-in-world small molecule inhibitors of BPLF1
deubiquitinating activity. The goals of this proposal are to 1) use high throughput screening to identify novel
chemotypes for a lead optimization effort and 2) produce further validation that small molecule inhibition of BPLF1
deubiquitinating activity is a promising avenue for treating diseases caused by EBV infection. This work will lay
the foundation for a chemical probe and drug discovery effort to combat EBV-associated disease."

 For more than a decade the importance of the microbiome and its role in health and disease has been
appreciated, yet the virome (the viral component of the microbiome) has remained understudied. Physiologic
changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period (often overlooked periods of the lifespan) include
dramatic adaptations in immune response that provide a unique opportunity to study and understand the
dynamic interplay between the virome and host. Both systemic and local modifications in innate and adaptive
immunity have been described, characterizing an “immunological clock” of pregnancy. These programmed
changes in immune response are critical for pregnancy success, providing a balance between fetal tolerance
and effective protection from pathogens, including viruses. Individual viruses that cause adverse pregnancy
outcomes have been frequently studied, for example those that cause more severe infection during pregnancy
and those that cause congenital infections. However, the complex communities of the virome (in this case
defined as all the viruses that infect human cells) have largely remained unexplored. We hypothesize that the
dynamic, programmed changes in immune response through pregnancy and postpartum will alter the
interactions between virome and host, revealing important underlying biology of the virome-maternal-fetal unit.
To test this hypothesis, we will prospectively collect longitudinal samples from the pregnancy, delivery, and
postpartum periods in a racially diverse cohort of 100 subjects enrolled at two sites to monitor the virome in
tandem with local and systemic immune responses."

Nurses are the largest healthcare sector, with approximately 5.2 million active licenses in the United States.
However, nurses encounter occupational hazards, including working night shifts, exposure to toxic chemicals,
and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, which increase their risks of getting various cancer types, including breast,
lung, and colorectal cancers. Cancer diagnoses pose significant risks to nurses, including challenges to their
return-to-work (RTW) and long-term impacts on their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Nurses with cancer
may face unique RTW challenges, as they deal with dual roles as both healthcare providers and as recipients
of care. Through the applicant’s preliminary work, nurses described that they gain valuable insights into patient
care because of their cancer experiences. Yet, nurses may experience cancer-related symptoms and
emotional distress that impede them from returning to work successfully. Despite the profound impact of
cancer on the nursing profession, there is a paucity of research addressing the RTW experiences of nurses
with cancer and the factors influencing their successful RTW. To address these research gaps, the proposed
research training consists of two phases: F99 (predoctoral) and K00 (post-doctoral) phases. The applicant will
receive F99 training at the University of Pittsburgh and the F99 phase involves a national cross-sectional study
that aims to assess the self-reported work limitations, HRQOL, perceived workplace support, and perceived
successful RTW of nurses diagnosed with cancer within the past five years and have returned to clinical
positions. The K00 phase involves training in human-centered design principles and mobile health
interventions, applying the above training in developing a mHealth intervention prototype collaboratively with a
stakeholder panel consisting of various healthcare workers, healthcare workers with cancer, mHealth
intervention experts, and healthcare leaders, and evaluating the prototype’s acceptability and usability among
healthcare workers with cancer. This proposed project seeks to bridge the research gaps in understanding the
RTW experiences of nurses with cancer and it aims to develop tailored a mHealth intervention to support them
in returning to clinical positions successfully. Ultimately, the long-term goal of this project is to establish an
independent program of research that promotes healthy RTW experiences among cancer survivors, thus
contributing to improving their overall health and well-being."
10993526,"Project Summary/Abstract - UTMDACC Ovarian SPORE Project 1
Ovarian cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that affects nearly 300,000 women worldwide
each year (1). Its poor outcomes relate to delayed diagnosis and development of resistance to conventional
therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel (2). In the last SPORE cycle, we evaluated a novel inhibitor of salt-induced
kinase 2 (SIK2) GRN-300 that enhances sensitivity to both carboplatin and paclitaxel (3,4). With the support of
the SPORE, we initiated a first-in-human phase IA/B trial to define the maximum tolerated dose of GRN-300
alone and in combination with weekly paclitaxel. We also conducted preclinical studies to demonstrate that GRN-
300 enhanced olaparib sensitivity in homologous recombination (HR)-proficient and deficient ovarian cancer cell
lines and xenografts. We have demonstrated that GRN-300 enhances olaparib sensitivity by 1) abolishing the
class IIa histone deacetylase 4/5/7-associated transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D),
2) decreasing MEF2D binding to regulatory regions with high chromatin accessibility in DNA repair genes, and
3) repressing critical gene expression in the DNA repair pathway. Whereas poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
inhibitors (PARPi) have played a large part in maintaining progression-free survival in patients with HR-deficient
ovarian cancers, the majority of patients will have resistance to PARPi and experience relapse (5). Moreover,
combining conventional or other targeted agents with PARPi has been limited by additive myelosuppression (6).
To date, GRN-300 has had no significant marrow toxicity in our phase I clinical trial. GRN-300 enhanced olaparib
activity in both olaparib-sensitive and acquired olaparib-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Cancer immunotherapy,
including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), has shown great promise for cancers at multiple sites, but the
frequency and duration of response of ovarian cancer has been limited (7). Recent studies suggest that a
deficiency in DNA repair is associated with increased response of cancer cells to immunotherapy (8,9). We have
found that GRN-300 increases phosphorylation of TBK1 and nuclear localization of IRF3 in murine ovarian
cancer cells. Both TBK1 and IRF3 are downstream targets of the cGAS/STING pathway. GRN-300 or GRN-300
combined with olaparib increases the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in human and murine
ovarian cancer cells. GRN-300 combined with anti-PD-L1 enhances CD8+ T-cell infiltration and antitumor activity
in a syngeneic ovarian cancer model. The goal of our project is to determine whether GRN-300 overcomes
resistance to PARPi and enhances PARPi sensitivity and whether GRN-300 promotes adaptive T-cell function
and enhances immune checkpoint therapy. We will pursue three aims: 1) To determine the underlying
mechanisms of olaparib resistance that can be overcome with the SIK2 inhibitor GRN-300 in combination with
olaparib in ovarian cancer cell lines and PDXs,2) To identify the mechanism(s) by which the SIK2 inhibitor GRN-
300, alone and in combination with olaparib, sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) and enhances T-cell cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells and syngeneic murine models, and 3) To
perform a phase IB trial of the SIK2 inhibitor GRN-300 in combination with olaparib."
10996326,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The US opioid crisis has been worsened by the emergence of fentanyl adulterated or associated with the
veterinary sedative xylazine (FAAX). Designated by the White House as an “emerging threat to the US” in 2023,
FAAX exacerbates overdose risk, contributes to severe skin wounds, and is associated with withdrawal.
Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, does not directly reverse xylazine’s sedative effect, exacerbating overdose risk.
Our understanding of how FAAX-related skin wounds appear and are treated is limited, but the effects of these
wounds are profound. Moreover, withdrawal from FAAX and its effect on medication for opioid use disorder, the
treatment of choice for opioid use disorder, is unknown. Further, there is no widely available point-of-care test
for xylazine to inform real-time clinical practice, limiting our ability to link those exposed to FAAX to treatment.
Recognizing the absence of a widely available point-of-care test, the long-term objective of this proposal is to
develop a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify FAAX-exposed patients. To
achieve this, the applicant proposes an exploratory, sequential, mixed methods study that builds upon his
formative research. Approximately 20-24 in-depth interviews with people who use drugs (PWUD) exposed to
FAAX in Rhode Island (RI) will be conducted to explore FAAX-related overdose, skin wounds, withdrawal
experiences, and self-treatment (AIM 1). Then, 8-10 key informant interviews with medical providers in RI to
PWUD exposed to FAAX will be conducted to understand emergent FAAX treatment practices and iteratively
refine a vocabulary list of FAAX symptom descriptions (i.e., NLP dictionary) following a modified Delphi approach
(AIM 2A). Then, we will apply the NLP dictionary via an NLP algorithm to the free-text electronic health records
of ~24,000 patients (≥18 years old & opioid or injection drug use diagnostic code) who received emergency
department care between 2015-2023 from a RI health system to identify patients exposed to FAAX (AIM 2B).
This fellowship will advance the applicant’s expertise beyond what would developed in his doctoral program and
enable the application of this skill set to an urgent public health priority aligned with NIDA’s Notice of Special
Interest NOT-DA-24-012 (Xylazine: Understanding its use and consequences). Through the sponsorship of an
interdisciplinary team with a collective 40+ years of substance use research and expertise in behavioral sciences,
epidemiology, addiction medicine, and natural language processing, the applicant will complete the proposed
research and the following training goals: (1) receive training in the design, conduct, and analysis of mixed

This project will test a new model of speech motor learning, whose central hypothesis is that learning and
retention are associated with plasticity not only in motor areas of the brain but in auditory and
somatosensory regions as well. The associated experiments are motivated by the results of our preliminary
work and each tests the new model in different ways. In Aim 1 we test the causal involvement in the
retention of new learning of each of the main players in the model. If plasticity in any of auditory,
somatosensory or motor cortex is central to retention, then suppression of its activity following learning
using cTBS, should lead to an impairment. Aim 2 examines the temporal order in which neuronal changes
are observed during learning. If auditory or somatosensory plasticity play a determining role in speech
motor learning, changes in these areas should be detectable early and should also predict subsequent
learning. Aim 3 examines circuit-level contributions to speech learning and retention. If plasticity in sensory
as well as motor areas underlies learning or retention, it should be possible to identify sensory as well as
motor areas whose baseline functional connectivity patterns predict subsequent learning and whose
connectivity patterns following learning predict subsequent retention. Our preliminary work on each of the
three aims supports the idea that there is plasticity in each of the primary systems which participate in
speech motor learning (auditory, somatosensory, motor)."
10984370,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While most postpartum women desire pregnancy prevention, fewer than half resume contraception in the
postpartum period. Finding approaches to supporting women’s reproductive goals during this critical transition
can promote reproductive health equity and prevent the adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes that are
associated with undesired, short interval pregnancies. Postpartum women commonly do not attend a
postpartum obstetric visit and face other unique barriers to getting their contraceptive needs met. A novel
opportunity to augment the existing system for delivering postpartum contraceptive care is the pediatric clinic,
where providers frequently and reliably interface with new mothers at infant visits. The proposed Aims will lead
to the development and testing of a pediatric clinic-based approach to enhancing access to postpartum
contraceptive care. A long-term goal of this research is to optimize how pediatricians incorporate evidence-
based, child-relevant aspects of maternal health and social needs into practice. For this four-year K23
proposal, the objective is to develop and pilot test a scalable pediatric clinic-based intervention designed to
meet the contraceptive needs of postpartum women and promote equitable access to contraceptive care. The
central hypothesis is that the pediatric clinic is a feasible and acceptable setting to identify and address unmet
postpartum contraceptive needs. The rationale for this study is that a postpartum contraception intervention,
developed using implementation science principles and stakeholder-engagement methods, has the potential to
prevent undesired pregnancies, support healthy birth spacing, and promote health equity for women and
families. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: (1) Qualitatively assess
intervention preferences for pediatric clinic-based postpartum contraceptive services among women and
healthcare team members (n=50), (2) Develop a pediatric clinic-based postpartum contraception intervention
through iterative focus groups and usability testing with patient and clinical stakeholders, and (3) Implement
and pilot test the pediatric clinic-based postpartum contraception intervention, measuring feasibility and
acceptability outcomes (n=50). The proposed Aims focus on postpartum contraceptive needs, but the
approach will serve as a model for future efforts to integrate perinatal maternal and child health services to
meet the health and social needs of women and children."

The primary goal of this P20 planning grant is to establish the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and
Health by developing a network of scientists and community members to build capacity for climate and
health research. The evolving nature of how a changing climate is impacting health will require
collaborations involving scientists, public health professionals, and community partners to identify critical
health concerns and create solutions for adaptation. To address this need he MC3H will administer a Pilot
Project and Emerging Issues Program. The overall goal of this program is to develop new initiatives and
partnerships in climate and health research that will create a substantial and sustainable research agenda
for climate change and health with specific goals as follow. 1) Lay the foundation for innovative and
impactful programs that address emerging and persistent challenges related to the health impacts of
climate change. 2) Facilitate the development of multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral partnerships to build
capacity for research related to climate change and health utilizing existing and novel data and community
resources. 3) Engage regional community partners to be involved with climate change and health research
with an emphasis on rural and American Indian communities. 4) Respond to rapidly evolving emerging and
re-emerging issues related to the health impacts of climate change. 5) Develop cutting edge research pilot
projects on the health impacts of climate change that have high probability of obtaining additional and
substantial funding. Areas of emphasis will be annually derived from a research agenda co-developed by
the Community Engagement Core and community partners with input from the External Advisory Board. A
funding opportunity announcement will be developed and delivered annually to potential investigators in
academia, government, non-governmental organizations, and Tribal communities. The center will facilitate
partnerships between experienced and less experienced investigators to propose and conduct pilot
research and develop subsequent high-quality proposals for more substantial projects in a timely manner.
The proposals will be reviewed for scientific and programmatic merit and final funding decisions will be
made by the Center Director. The center will establish protocols and that promote best practices when
conducting research with American Indian communities and for sharing results with communities.
Communication back to the relevant communities will be required. The center will track and evaluate the
progress of the research and work with the grant recipients on the process of preparing follow-up proposals
to ensure conversion of the pilot research into more substantive projects. Additionally, with input from the
External Advisory Board and community partners time critical emerging issues will be identified that can be
investigated by center staff to yield novel information related to climate change. All activities conducted in
this program will be highlighted as poster presentations the annual center symposium."
10981831,"Self-directed violence (SDV), defined as anything a person does intentionally that can cause injury to one’s
self, including death, suicide attempt, suicide ideation, and non-suicidal self-injury,1 is a significant public health
issue. Project Lift Up is the only national longitudinal survey of youth and young adults designed to study expo-
sure to SDV as well as pathways to engaging in bystander, or helping, behaviors for those at-risk. This study
began in 2021 (NIMH 1R01MH128269)4 to examine the attitudinal and contextual components that predict
SDV bystander behavior, understand the impact of bystander behavior on the bystanders themselves, and ex-
amine how these trends vary for sub-groups of youth facing health disparities (i.e., sexual, gender, racial and
ethnic minority youth). Project Lift Up consists of 4,890 teens and young adults, aged 13-22 years, who agreed
to participate in this 3-wave longitudinal study. We have an oversample of sexual (58.8%) and gender (37.3%)
minority youth, as well as a diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, income and other social and structural determi-
nants of health. Data indicate almost universal exposure to SDV: 94.4% of youth report lifetime exposure to
SDV and 87.4% reported their own SDV. These high rates of personal SDV in our cohort provide us with a
unique opportunity to gather data about bystander/gatekeeper behavior from a different perspective, namely
that of the recipient – or the person struggling with SDV. Pilot data from Project Lift Up on SDV help receipt
indicates a range of feelings about and responses to those who tried to help them; feelings ranged from being
thankful and appreciative to feeling ashamed, sad, scared, guilty and indifferent. Two comments that reflect the
opinions of many “I appreciated it but felt as though it was futile or a waste of time” and “I always thanked
them, but it never really helped, especially not in the moment.” To effectively measure SDV bystander behavior
from this perspective, an in-depth survey focusing on the experiences of those who have engaged in SDV
about their disclosure and the help they may have received is needed to supplement our existing survey struc-
ture. To collect these data, we need to supplement data collection with the funded cohort with an additional
survey that focuses on the recipient’s perspective on being helped. The survey would include items describing
disclosure of one’s own SDV, ways people have tried to help them, what actions they felt were most helpful,
any negative responses, stigma, and what type of help they hoped for. Specifically, this Revision will: 1a) Re-
survey a cohort of 4,890 youth about disclosure of SDV, the range of help they received (if any), and their per-
ceptions of that help; 1b) Examine how these trends of disclosure and help receipt for SDV are different for
sexual, gender, racial, and ethnic minority youth; 2) Examine how one’s own experiences around SDV disclo-
sure, help-seeking and receipt influence pathways for opportunity, intentions, attitudes and behaviors of help-
ing others struggling with SDV; and 3) Explore in more depth the context of SDV disclosure, what types of help
they expected, and their reactions to different forms of helping through qualitative interviews."

The process of vascular stabilization—which includes mural cell recruitment to the blood vessels—is critical for
organism development and survival. The hemodynamic forces from blood flow itself play a part in these
stabilization events; however, there are still many gaps in our understanding of how this mechanosensitive
signaling occurs and how blood vessel integrity is influenced by disruptions in mechanosensing. Primary cilia on
endothelial cells (ECs) have been proposed to be mechanosensitive structures that facilitate signaling in
response to hemodynamic forces, though most of our current understanding of this process stems from in vitro
work. Interestingly, genetic studies from patient cohorts with congenital heart defects (CHD) reveal an
unexpectedly high association with cilia-related gene variants. Consequently, the study of hemodynamics,
primary cilia, and congenital cardiovascular defects is a largely unexplored field that could have a meaningful
impact on understanding and treating CHD. Thus, the objectives of this proposal are to determine if EC cilia
respond to changes in hemodynamic forces during development, to define a mechanism for primary cilia in
vessel stabilization, and to model novel cilia-related human CHD variants and assess the vascular phenotypes
using the zebrafish animal model. The proposed studies are based on robust preliminary data showing EC
primary cilia are evident—and unexpectedly, abluminal—during axial vasculature stabilization events, and that
embryos with mutant cilia display phenotypic abnormalities associated with compromised vascular stability.
Additional preliminary data suggests that both luminal and abluminal cilia can assemble or disassemble in
response to changes in blood flow. Furthermore, embryos with mutant cilia display aberrant mural cell
association. Together these data support the central hypothesis that endothelial primary cilia are
mechanosensitive regulators of cardiovascular development in part due to their influence on mural cell function
and vascular stability. My hypothesis will be tested with the three aims: 1) assess the orientation and localization
of EC cilia in response to hemodynamic changes across vascular development, 2) determine the role of primary
cilia in mural cell recruitment, differentiation, and vascular stabilization during development, and 3) utilize human
CHD data to identify cilia-related defects and analyze the functional consequences of those gene mutations in
zebrafish. This work is innovative because it will utilize the zebrafish model to explore mechanosensitive
mechanisms linked to vascular stabilization events in vivo. The proposed research is significant in its aim to
provide novel insight to the EC cilia field by identifying abluminal cilia and demonstrating that they are
mechanosensitive structures in vivo, in addition to clarifying the impact of primary cilia on vascular stabilization
and congenital cardiovascular defects."

Opioid use has reached epidemic proportions and is now the leading cause of preventable death in the United
States. Beyond the risk of death, opioid use disorder causes an incalculable amount of suffering as it devastates
the lives of individuals and their communities. The heightened motivation for drug rewards compared to non-
drug rewards stems in part from changes in the brain circuity associated with motivation. A greater understanding
of this circuitry may lead to targeted interventions that can attenuate drug motivation. Decades of research
demonstrate that the lateral hypothalamus (LHA), and its modulation of the dopamine system, plays a crucial
role motivation. Multiple species of animals will work tirelessly to obtain electrical stimulation of the LHA, and
lesions of the LHA reduce motivation across a broad spectrum of behaviors. Recent research has revealed
complexity in the function of the LHA, as subpopulations of neurons can drive discrete or even opposing
behavioral phenotypes. Despite the established role in motivation broadly, the role of the LHA subpopulations in
motivation for opioids remains largely unknown. This proposal seeks to investigate the behavioral function
and spatiotemporal signaling dynamics of multiple LHA subpopulations and downstream dopaminergic
signaling during the development and expression of motivation for opioids. During the K99 period, I will
receive world-class training in the theory of opioid pharmacology and self-administration, techniques for
longitudinal recording using 2-photon imaging, and advanced analysis of the relationships between neuronal
signaling dynamics and behavior. In Aim 1 (K99), I will determine the causal behavioral function of multiple LHA
subpopulations during motivation for opioids using transient inhibition or excitation of neurotransmitter defined
neuron populations. In Aim 2 (K99), I will determine the relation between bulk signaling dynamics in the LHA
subpopulations and downstream dopamine signaling using fiber-photometry and the single cell dynamics of LHA
subpopulations using 2-photon imaging throughout the development and expression motivation for opioids. By
recording throughout the experiment, I will have the power to characterize bulk and single-cell signals based on
activity across each stage of opioid self-administration. In Aim 3 (R00), as I transition to developing my own
research lab, I will investigate the caudal circuit effects of transient stimulation of LHA subpopulations during
motivation for opioids. Altogether, the results of the proposed aims will deepen our understanding of the role of
the LHA in mediating motivation for drugs of abuse and related neuronal circuitry. The training I will receive
throughout the K99/R00 period will facilitate my development into an independent researcher investigating the
behavioral function and spatiotemporal signaling dynamics related to substance use disorder."
10983073,"The proposed project entails (1) user-centered development of an innovative web-based intervention to reduce
alcohol-related harm among young adults, and (2) pilot testing the intervention to assess indices of acceptability
and engagement, as well as preliminary assessment of efficacy, relative to a treatment-as-usual and attention-
matched control conditions. Personalized normative feedback (PNF) – i.e., correcting misperceptions about
peers’ alcohol use behaviors and contrasting one’s own use to the actual norms of their peers – is an economic
strategy that is widely used on college campuses. Although effects of PNF interventions are consistent, and
generally maintained, the effect sizes can be improved; thus, innovation is needed to further move the needle.
The proposed intervention will expand traditional PNFs that generally only provide normative feedback for ‘typical
students’ at participants’ university, by providing options for users to customize their experience and explore a
variety of more specific normative feedback modules; for example, providing normative feedback specific to first
year students, Hispanic students, or sexual minoritized students (many other modules will be available). This
novel paradigm will provide users with a truly personalized and engaging experience in which individuals receive
normative feedback on the referent groups that are most meaningful and interesting to them. Although this
customizability is anticipated to increase engagement and efficacy, it will also provide more equitable prevention,
as many students may not identify with the ‘typical student’ (e.g., minoritized students) and these students may
be more receptive to feedback that is more aligned with their own identities. Thus, this pilot project will lay the
groundwork for a novel customizable personalized normative feedback (CPNF) intervention paradigm whereby
users can choose to explore normative feedback for a wider variety of referent groups (as many as they wish to
explore), in addition to typical student norms feedback. In Phase 1 of the pilot project, we will develop and refine
the CPNF intervention content, design, and deliverability through a multi-step, iterative process called rapid
prototyping (N=30). In line with user centered design, young adults will be incorporated into and provide feedback
on all steps to ensure that a relevant and engaging final product is created. Rapid prototyping allows us to quickly
gather user feedback and make changes based on user preferences. Once the intervention is developed and
fully programmed, Phase 2 will entail a pilot RCT (N=250) of the CPNF intervention. Aim 2 will specifically
examine feasibility of the CPNF intervention paradigm in terms of acceptability, engagement, interest, and
satisfaction, and will examine whether these indices are higher among students who are in most need of this
type of intervention (e.g., heavier drinkers). Aim 3 will entail a ‘proof-of-concept’ test of efficacy, relative to
standard PNF and attention-matched control conditions, in terms of reductions in alcohol use and negative
consequences assessed at 1- and 3-month follow-ups, and test whether CPNF increases treatment equity for
students of marginalized identities (race/ethnicity and sexual/gender minorities), relative to standard PNF."

Global estimates suggest that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) now has the highest incidence, prevalence, and worst
survival outcomes of stroke. With an estimated 1.4 million stroke survivors, outcomes of stroke in SSA are
abysmal with 1-month case fatality at 30% and 3-year mortality rate of 84%. Stroke survivors in Africa are at an
inordinately high (and worsening) risk of adverse outcomes including recurrent stroke and cardiac events over
the medium- to long-term. Given the paucity of resources in the region, testing of therapies, which are potentially
highly clinically efficacious and cost-effective, while developing local stroke research capacity and contributing
to the global secondary stroke prevention evidence base, is urgently needed. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase 3
inhibitor, has shown promising efficacy and safety mainly among an Asian population by cutting risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, in half, when added to aspirin or clopidogrel (8% vs. 4%, HR
0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.77), with no increased risk in bleeding or serious adverse events. Cilostazol’s potentially
strong efficacy, presumed pleiotropic effects, and relatively low cost, make it a highly appealing agent for use in
stroke-prone, low-resource settings. Therefore, the overall objective of the CiLostAzol for pReventIon of recurrent
sTroke in Africa (CLARITY-AFRICA) study is to deploy a hybrid study design to demonstrate the efficacy and
safety of cilostazol twice daily in reducing MACE over 24 months vs. placebo among 800 recent stroke patients
encountered at 12 hospitals in Ghana. Secondly, CLARITY-AFRICA also seeks to develop an implementation
strategy for routine integration and policy adoption of cilostazol for post-stroke cardiovascular risk reduction in
an under-resourced system. Given its compelling efficacy among a predominantly Asian population, the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is poised to fund a US-based clinical trial to assess the
longer-term efficacy and safety of cilostazol in a study titled CiLostAzol for pReventIon of recurrent sTroke
(CLARITY). We are also aware that European and Australian funding agencies are considering stroke trials of
cilostazol. A concurrently executed CLARITY-Africa trial would allow recruitment of a historically under-
represented and high-risk group (Africans), test a therapy that if efficacious could be affordable for broader
regional implementation, permit transcontinental mentorship/collaborations, and leverage NINDS impending
investment. CLARITY-AFRICA will assess implementation outcomes such as adoption, acceptability, cost,
pertinent to uptake of cilostazol in Ghana to inform policy. Regardless of its outcome, findings from CLARITY-
AFRICA will contribute meaningful information from the African perspective to inform the formulation of
guidelines for global adoption of cilostazol into routine care for secondary CVD risk prevention by international
bodies such as the World Health Organization."

 The overall goal of this project is to determine the association of mushroom intake with cognitive
function in a middle-aged and elderly cohort conducted in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Healthy diets are associated
with reducing the risk of cognitive decline and there is a need to identify specific foods that delay or reduce
cognitive impairment in the elderly. Mushrooms are foods that contain several beneficial ingredients that have
shown to reduce cognitive decline in animal studies, possibly through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
pathways. Mushrooms are infrequently consumed in the United States and their effects in humans have been
understudied. We showed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey that in persons over age 60
who participated in a battery of cognitive tests, mushroom consumers evidenced higher scores and better
cognitive function. Mushrooms are fungi, and contain unique compounds not found in plants and animals.
Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergothioneine, a thiohistidine betaine amino acid that is a powerful
antioxidant. In particular, the ergothioneine transporter OCTN1 gene is a specific transporter for the uptake of
ergothioneine to cells and tissues experiencing oxidative stress. Mushrooms also contain high concentrations
of glutathione (GSH), the most abundant intracellular antioxidants in humans. The traditional Japanese diet,
which includes mushroom consumption, is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline in the Ohsaki
Cohort 2006 Study. We have the opportunity to study the individual effects of mushrooms and their key
constituents in the Japanese National Institute for Longevity Sciences-Longitudinal Study of Aging. This is a
multi-wave cohort study conducted in men and women ages 40-79 who have been followed for age-related
health effects including cognitive measures. The study uses detailed questionnaire, medical records, and
nutritional assessments. There are several reasons why the NILS-LSA is the ideal population for our
hypothesis. Mushrooms are consumed by a higher percent of the population in Japan and in greater daily
amounts than in the U.S. In addition, the ergothioneine content of mushroom species consumed in Japan is
higher than the white button mushrooms typically consumed in the U.S. Our specific aims are:
1. Determine the relationship between mushroom intake and a battery of neurocognitive outcomes including
cognitive function, dementia, and depression. Based on 24-hr food recall data, mushroom intake at baseline
and at success waves will be examined prospectively using generalized equation models in relation to a
battery of cognitive measures including medically determined clinical dementia, the Wechsler Adult Intelligent
Scale (WAIS-R digit span test), the Mini-Mental State Examination, and clinical depression.
2. Determine the relationship between ergothioneine and GSH levels and risk of neurocognitive measures
using baseline blood samples for a subset of 309 participants. Causal mediation analysis will be conducted to
determine the direct effects of mushroom and indirect effects attributed to ergothioneine and GSH."

The racial disparity in uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) is profound among Black/African American women (BW) –
with an earlier age of onset by 10-15 years, a significantly higher incidence, and greater rates of hysterectomy,
a major surgical procedure, compared to White women (WW). The impact of fibroids is significant for
reproductive age women, especially BW who experience more symptomatology such as excessive bleeding,
pain, and reproductive problems. Therefore, research on the risk factors for fibroids is important. Earlier onset
of fibroids among BW may explain their larger fibroid size and increased symptomatology. Our main
hypotheses are that exposure to adverse childhood events (ACEs) contributes to incident fibroids and greater
growth and that psychosocial resources may buffer the risk. We will use data from the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences Study of Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF) that enrolled 1308 BW ages 23-34 years
without a clinical diagnosis of fibroids and collected extensive data at baseline and across 3 follow-up visits on
early childhood social and environmental factors, reproductive and sexual histories, and demographic,
economic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors. We will evaluate the hypotheses by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Describe the prevalence ACEs occurring before age 12 by type, cumulative risk, and latent class
profiles, and examine the association between each ACE measure and childhood and adult contextual factors;
2) Describe each ACE measure in relationship to the trajectory of C-reactive protein (CRP); and 3) Examine
the association between each ACE measure and the incidence and growth of uterine fibroids, and then
evaluate the modifying effect of psychosocial resources. This proposed ancillary research study will elucidate
the association between ACEs and incident fibroids with less bias than previous research due to improved
ascertainment of both the exposure (i.e., 7 ACEs) and outcome (i.e., repeated and standardized ultrasound
exams in fibroid-free participants at study entry). Fibroids pose a major public health concern with an estimated
total associated cost (medical, work-related, etc.) of up to $34.4 billion annually. Determining risk factors for
fibroids, such as the early life stress of ACEs, will provide key information to improve the quality of life for Black
women, who are more likely to experience missed days from work and disruption in physical activities and
social relationships due to fibroids. It will also provide a strong research foundation that sheds light on potential
intervention targets to reduce morbidity and surgical disparities, set the stage for identifying biological
mechanisms for prevention, and elucidate the context of early life stressors on fibroid risk."

Over the past 40 years, the standard therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a highly fatal blood cancer,
remains a combination of chemo drugs such as cytarabine and an anthracycline. Drug resistance in AML inevi-
tably occurs over time. While it is evident that drug resistance and AML burdens are often associated downreg-
ulation of tumor-suppressor transcription factors and the manifestation of oncogenic transcription factor fusions,
therapeutic approaches directly focused on these pivotal biomolecules remains a technical challenge. Our long-
term goals are to identify molecular regulators and partners of cancer-associated transcription factors and to
understand how they cross-regulate in cancer, thereby utilizing this understanding for preventative and thera-
peutic purposes. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the role and the mechanism underlying
noncoding RNA deregulation in primary and relapsed AML. We recently discovered and characterized a PU.1
enhancer RNA that is capable of inducing myeloid cell differentiation while inhibiting cell growth. We also dis-
covered that the noncoding RNA is inhibited by RUNX1-ETO, a transcription factor fusion that is derived from
one of the most frequent chromosomal translocations associated with AML. We further revealed that it is inhibited
relapsed AML patients. Therefore, we propose that PU.1 regulatory RNAs acts as RNA modulators of the
RUNX1-ETO/PU.1 axis and are important RNA regulators in both primary and relapsed AML. Toward that end,
my lab has generated chemo-resistant AML cell models, and we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1)
Determine the role of the RNA in primary and relapsed AML, and 2) Define the mechanism underlying its dereg-
ulation in AML. These aims will be achieved by using a variety of approaches including RNA interactions and
gene regulation via chromatin structure with the use of transcriptomic and genomic data from AML patients,
drug-resistant AML cell lines and AML mouse models. Completion of these aims will provide an important insight
into the functions of enhancer RNAs in primary and relapsed AML and provide a scientific basis for modulating
activities of tumor-suppressor transcription factors as well as oncogenic fusion protein. There is the promise that
regulatory RNAs could be utilized in AML treatment. Ultimately, this could be expected to result in the develop-
ment of novel RNA-based drugs to circumvent the current challenge in targeting transcription factors and their
oncogenic derivatives in cancer therapy."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of islet beta cells within the pancreas, which
leads to the inability of the body to produce insulin, dysregulation of glucose metabolism, and disabling and
potentially life-threatening damage to organs throughout the body. Development of new methods for early T1D
diagnosis and new clinical approaches to arrest the autoimmune response are limited by incomplete information
on T1D-associated T cells and the pathways they use to target pancreatic islets. Clinical and genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) reveal that specific MHC class II (MHC-II) genes provide the strongest genetic
predisposition to T1D, along with other key T1D-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including
genes that influence T cell development, signaling, and function. How expression of particular MHC-II alleles
predisposes T cell repertoires towards autoimmunity and why their heterozygous expression does not confer a
similar predisposition remains unresolved. We propose to identify tissue- and disease- specific processes that
underlie T1D susceptibility by comparing autoimmune T cell development and function in host that solely
express T1D-associated MHC-II allele with their disease-protected heterozygous counterparts. We will focus on
studies of a novel Non-Obese Diabetic mouse model we have generated in which the MHC-II polymorphic
residues most closely associated with T1D susceptibility have been substituted with the most common variants,
I-Ag7 β56P/57D (I-Ag7-PD) using CRISPR /Cas9 techniques. Studies of individual with and without T1D will be
used to reveal commonalities between the mouse model and human disease. Our preliminary data suggests
homozygous expression of I-Ag7 in NOD mice allows high affinity β-islet specific CD4 T cells to develop, which
following their activation in the periphery, differentiate into effector populations that are required for pancreatic
targeting and to induce the activation of pathogenic CD8 T cell clones. Heterozygous expression the T1D
protective allele, I-Ag7 β56P/57D (I-Ag7-PD), however, turns this autoimmune circuit is turned off at least in part
during T cell development. In NOD mice that co-express I-Ag7-PD and I-Ag7 (I-Ag7-PD/WT), significant negative
selection to the I-Ag7-restricted T cell repertoire occurs, including the targeting of β-islet specific CD4 T cells.
However, contrary to prevailing models, negative selection occurs despite I-Ag7-PD having an inability to present
β-islet to CD4 T cells in vivo. Proposed experiments will determine thymic selection events that regulate the
overall affinity of self- and/or foreign-reactive T cell repertoires. Studies of the mature T cell compartment will
identify key events that allow T cell to acquire pathogenic potential, leading to the targeting pancreatic β-islets.
These studies will provide important insights into the fine-tuning of T cell repertoires by thymic selection events
and differentiation pathways that discriminate pathogenic T cell responses from those that are merely self-
reactive, leading to rational approaches in the design of therapeutics to manipulate immune responses for
treatments of T1D and other autoimmune diseases."

 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia and accounts for 20%
of leukemia-related deaths annually. In CLL, hyperactivation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) response leads to over-
activation of many downstream effectors that drive proliferation and survival, including Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase
(BTK), LYN Kinase and the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). This, along with
interactions with the microenvironment, leads to metabolic reprogramming and increased metabolic plasticity,
allowing CLL cells to thrive under various conditions. Our lab has previously shown that delivery of ceramide,
via a ceramide nanoliposome (CNL), targets this metabolic plasticity and disrupts the STAT3 signaling pathway,
leading to decreased transcriptional activity, impaired glycolysis and cell death in multiple CLL models, including
patient samples. However, restoration of glycolysis and/or STAT3 transcriptional activity only partially protects
from CNL-induced cell death, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play. Here, using an advanced
mitochondrial metabolomics workflow, I show that CNL disrupts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by
selectively inhibiting Complex III of the electron transport chain. This disruption of OXPHOS is time dependent
and correlates with a CNL induced upregulation of glycosphingolipids in both whole cells and mitochondrial
extracts, suggesting an unexpected link. Importantly, while glycosphingolipids are typically seen as a protective
shunt away from more apoptotic ceramides, I have shown that inhibition of glucosylceramide (the gateway lipid
to the glycosphingolipid pathway) formation protects from CNL mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cell
death in CLL, further supporting this connection. Lastly, glucosylceramide blockade also diminishes the ability of
CNL to alter LYN and BTK phosphorylation. Given these effects, I hypothesize that sialic acid containing
glycosphingolipids downstream of glucosylceramide activate SIGLECS (the sialic acid binding proteins known
to negatively regulate BCR signaling) leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Insights into this area
will provide a novel therapeutic framework for CLL patients and deepen our understanding of lipid/protein biology.
 The first aim of this proposal (F99 Phase) identifies the key glycosphingolipid metabolites driving these
effects, determines the mechanism by which they alter BCR signaling effectors and mitochondrial function, and
evaluates their therapeutic potential in vivo. The knowledge and skills learned from these studies will then be
used to study the role of lipid metabolism in the metabolic plasticity of glioma stem cells and in the mechanisms
governing mitochondrial transfer between these cells and astrocytes in the context of glioblastoma (K99 Phase)."

10994702,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are type-2 diabetes (T2D) medications designed to
promote urinary glucose excretion that are increasingly associated with unanticipated health benefits. Growing
evidence indicates SGLT2i have off-target effects that improve insulin action, including studies in humans and
mouse models of obesity. The effect has been attributed to enhanced skeletal muscle insulin action, yet
remains untested. The mechanistic explanation as to how SGLT2i may enhance skeletal muscle insulin action
also remains unknown. These gaps in knowledge indicate unrealized therapeutic potential of SGLT2i. Taken
together, there is a critical need to determine the impact and underlying mechanisms of SGLT2i treatment on
regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism. Our long-term goal is to identify strategies to improve skeletal
muscle metabolic health and lower disease risk. Our objective in this application is to determine mechanisms
by which SGLT2i modulate skeletal muscle metabolism as part of an expanded model of SGLT2i treatment.
Our overall hypothesis is that SGLT2i have direct actions on skeletal muscle to increase glucose uptake as a
function of inhibiting mitochondrial complex I and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The
hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data. We provide new evidence that SGLT2i treatment improves
glucose uptake in skeletal muscle as a function of enhanced insulin signaling. We demonstrate these effects
are likely attributable to direct actions on skeletal muscle, whereby all 4 FDA-approved SGLT2i cause dose-
dependent inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and activation of AMPK. Importantly, our new findings of off-
target mechanisms of action of SGLT2i on muscle identify clinical relevance to determine overlap with
metformin (a common T2D co-therapy) on complex I metabolism. The following aims test specific hypotheses
of our overall model. Aim 1: Determine the role of complex I inhibition for SGLT2i regulation of skeletal muscle
metabolism. We will determine the effects of SGLT2i treatments on skeletal muscle mitochondrial
bioenergetics and insulin action in western diet fed mice using both acute and chronic treatment strategies.
Aim 2: Identify the requirement of AMPK for SGLT2i regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism. We will use an
inducible, skeletal muscle-specific AMPK knockout model then determine glucose uptake in isolated tissues
and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Aim 3: Identify combination of canagliflozin and metformin treatment on
complex I metabolism. We will treat mice with metformin then determine combination with either canagliflozin
or empagliflozin on complex I respiratory function in skeletal muscle and liver. The proposed studies can be
expected to provide new information regarding how SGLT2i regulate skeletal muscle metabolism and
contribute to improved metabolic health. The work will establish a new proposed mechanism of action for a
widely used class of medications, new mechanistic understanding of interaction during combined SGLT2i and
metformin treatment, and evidence to support new applications for use of SGLT2i."
10982447,"Background: Over 40% of Veterans have obesity, a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Weight loss
interventions produce clinically significant weight loss, yet weight regain commonly occurs due to declining
adherence to lifestyle changes. These changes are often substantially influenced by others in the home. Thus,
involving both Veterans and a cohabiting support person in weight management efforts could improve long-
term weight loss. The goal of the proposed trial is to evaluate the efficacy of involving romantic and non-
romantic support persons in weight management efforts to sustain long-term weight loss in Veterans.
Significance: This study will contribute to our long-term goal of implementing effective approaches to reduce
obesity and associated comorbidities among Veterans. This proposal addresses Health Services Research &
Development priorities of access, primary care practice, and virtual care and Office of Research &
Development priority of providing Veterans with access to high-quality clinical trials. The importance of
identifying efficacious strategies for weight loss maintenance was highlighted in a 2016 State-of-the-Art
conference on weight management.
Innovation: We will substantially enhance prior work and the MOVE! program offered through the VA by 1)
teaching Veterans and their support persons to apply communication and support skills to support Veteran
weight management and 2) focusing on long-term weight loss.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare effects of patient-only and partner-assisted interventions on long-term weight
loss (primary outcome) and obesity-specific quality of life (secondary outcome). Our primary hypothesis is that
average weight loss from baseline among Veterans will be at least 3 percentage points greater, a clinically
meaningful difference, in the partner-assisted arm than the patient-only arm at 72 weeks. Aim 2: Evaluate the
extent to which early intervention effects are mediated by changes in interdependence theory constructs
(transformation of motivation, couple efficacy, outcome expectancy, and social support). Aim 3: Evaluate
implementation outcomes of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility among MOVE! Coordinators via
validated surveys and qualitative interviews, and evaluate treatment receipt and enactment among a subset of
participating Veterans and support persons via qualitative interviews.
Methodology: This is a two-arm randomized trial. Participants: Dyads comprising a Veteran with obesity and a
cohabiting adult support person. Intervention: Index patients will participate in a group-based weight
management program using the Veterans Affairs (VA) national MOVE! weight management curriculum and
delivered using the VA virtual technology platform, VA Video Connect. Support persons will join the sessions,
and dyads will learn and practice communication skills. Comparison: Veterans will participate in the weight
management program without a support person. Outcomes: The primary outcome is percent weight loss from
baseline. Time: The intervention is 72 weeks in duration. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and every 24
weeks, with 72 weeks as the primary endpoint.
Implementation: We will assess MOVE! coordinator perceptions of intervention appropriateness,
acceptability, and feasibility and Veteran treatment receipt and enactment in Aim 3. Armed with this
information, we will be poised to study implementation in the future. The materials developed in this study
could be disseminated and implemented as an optional module by MOVE! Coordinators."

The success of the Center for Climate: Equitable and Accessible Research-based Testing
for Health (C-EARTH) will depend largely on efficient communication, planning, and synergy
among the project, cores, and activities. To accomplish this, the Administrative Core will
provide an infrastructure for logistical and scientific oversight, coordination, and integration of C-
EARTH, ensuring the synthesis of C-EARTH components and activities towards solutions-
oriented translation of findings in support of two themes of the P20 RFA: 1) to investigate the
feasibility, acceptability, uptake, and spread of interventions to promote preparedness and
adaptation to anticipated health impacts of climate change at individual, community, regional, or
national levels; and 2) to explore climate-related vulnerabilities in nutritional security in
disadvantaged communities to inform culturally sensitive and sustainable solutions. The
Administrative Core will serve as a central forum for communication among investigators across
the project and cores, coordination to establish and maintain partnerships to engage
communities most likely to be impacted by climate change, and active participation in the NIH
Research Coordinating Center. We will also carry out career development plans and
evaluations for our early stage faculty and researchers. The core’s activities will ensure
sustainable research capacity by managing the utilization of centralized resources and research
infrastructure. The Administrative Core will also oversee a robust data infrastructure and
management plan, providing the framework necessary for seamless data management, sharing,
and analysis. In particular, the Administrative Core will implement innovative databases and
tools for climate readiness for communities and for mapping high-resolution apparent
temperature at scale. These resources will support the research and core activities throughout
C-EARTH. With a strong supportive structure in place, C-EARTH will create a premiere
environment for translational research on the health consequences of climate change."
10982801,"The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, is disproportionately
impacting the health of racial/ethnic minority and low-income populations. There is an urgent need to develop
climate-smart solutions for heat stress in marginalized communities, addressing both direct effects on health
(e.g., death, heat stress) and indirect impacts on food and water supplies. To meet this need, the Center for
Climate: Equitable and Accessible Research-based Testing for Health (C-EARTH) will use a community-
centered approach to combat heat stress, recognizing that locally tailored, culturally appropriate climate-smart
solutions are essential for sustainability. Our research project will assess the impact of heat stress on
vulnerable populations in three distinct settings at established partner locations. Each site addresses the
escalating heat-related health impacts of climate change on a different scale: Boston focuses on individuals,
Madagascar focuses on small communities in rural, remote zones, and South Africa focuses on households in
urban built environments. At each project site, we will analyze associations between heat exposure and heat
stress and other heat-related health outcomes, utilizing a standardized questionnaire across all sites. Then, in
close partnership with community organizations at each site, we will implement and test cooling solutions that
promote resilience to heat stress for the most vulnerable members of these communities through intervention
studies and cohort-controlled research. For the intervention studies, we will address the following aims: 1)
determine whether educational resources and a cooling solution in 100 subjects improves health and thermal
condition outcomes for high-risk older adults with chronic disease and material hardships in Boston; 2)
evaluate the feasibility, use, and health impact of cooling centers with HEPA filters and freezers for fish storage
in four communities in Madagascar; and 3) determine whether a passive housing cooling solution improves
indoor temperatures and health outcomes in a subset of 32 households in South Africa. Together with our core
teams, we will implement these solutions with community partners, evaluate their effectiveness, and develop
methods to translate our findings towards policy. The breadth of cultural systems, ecological zones, and
economic vulnerability of our three sites will ensure a diversity of settings for generalizing and scaling
successful interventions. If successful, we will be able to scale this approach from individuals to national levels,
enhancing climate resilience and health equity."
10982802,"Climate change-driven heat stress is an issue of health equity, driven by lack of resources and lack of access
to cooling. Community-driven cooling solutions must be at the forefront of a sustainable, just path forward. It is
critical that researchers, community leaders, and policy decision-makers integrate their perspectives and
expertise to collaborate in bringing forth the urgent cooling solutions needed to protect communities from
morbidity and mortality due to heat stress. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will support the Center
for Climate: Equitable and Accessible Research-based Testing for Health (C-EARTH) community-based,
interdisciplinary research initiative by engaging community and public official stakeholders to address the
impacts of climate change-driven heat stress. C-EARTH is founded on the principle that the community must
be at the center of evidence-based climate solutions. Community partnership and community-rooted processes
will enable a depth of understanding of the needs of the communities we serve in Boston, Madagascar, and in
the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education Network, and determine which solutions will most
effectively respond to these site-specific needs. The CEC will work hand in hand with the Implementation,
Solutions, and Evaluation Core to develop and synthesize evaluation metrics to assess our community
engagement practices, and will apply a committee structure to use that data to iterate and improve our
community engagement practices. The CEC will have three major aims: 1) provide training in community
partnership that cultivates trust, multi-directional communication, clear role definition, and shared decision-
making towards implementing community-based climate solutions that reduce health inequities; 2) support the
delivery of community-driven climate solutions that address health inequities in the community and are
responsive to the needs described by the community; and 3) synthesize evaluation data of our community
partnership work and use a committee-based model to conduct quality improvement cycles and inform policy-
makers of findings. The CEC’s approach to integrating research and community engagement will enable
effective feedback loops of inquiry, communication, collaboration, relationship building, and action. This
approach will enable a cohesive, effective team structure, and promote capacity to inform policy-makers of
outcomes of early community projects and research investigations."
10982803,"ISE Abstract
Evaluation and dissemination of evidence-based solutions to mitigate the health effects of heat stress can curb
the anticipated increases in heat-related morbidity and mortality in the coming decades due to climate change.
However, little research to date has considered how to evaluate and disseminate locally-appropriate climate
and health solutions across diverse global contexts. Doing so requires careful attention to the local context and
resources, how the interventions are delivered and received by the community, and the types of quantitative
data and dissemination products most valuable to decision-makers. Adopting an implementation science (IS)
perspective, which has scarcely been applied in the climate solutions setting, can assist us in designing and
evaluating climate change solutions in a manner that increases the likelihood they will be spread and utilized.
The Implementation, Solutions and Evaluation Core (ISE) of C-EARTH will conduct rigorous evaluations of the
impacts of the cooling solutions under study at each project site (Boston, Madagascar, and South Africa) and
will advance the translation of these solutions into policy through the design of responsive dissemination
products developed using an innovative approach to participatory IS for climate change and health.
Specifically, the ISE aims to provide the following services and supports at each project site: (1) conduct robust
quantitative and qualitative data analyses to assess the effectiveness and implementation of cooling solutions
and community engagement; (2) use participatory approaches to support policy translation of solutions
(including economic evaluations and co-design of dissemination products) at local, regional, and national
levels; and (3) co-develop and offer capacity-building interventions for researchers and local leaders to support
a “designing for dissemination” approach to solution generation. To ensure success of these aims, we have
assembled a team with rich expertise in implementation science, community-engaged research, biostatistics,
environmental health, and economic evaluation, and we will leverage long-standing partnerships that C-
EARTH’s leaders have with community leaders and policy-makers in the three settings. The work of the ISE
will also be closely integrated and synergistic with the projects, the CEC, and the NIH Climate Change and
Health Research Coordinating Center. In addition to providing essential supports to enhance the rigor and
impact of the work undertaken by C-EARTH, the ISE will serve as a pioneering model of applying participatory
IS approaches to advance climate change and health solutions. Broader application of such approaches will
increase uptake of climate change-focused evidence-based solutions and facilitate transformational policy
change to reduce the health risks of climate change."

The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) is a research initiative that aims to diagnose rare and unknown conditions. However, the UDN has a low representation of minority and underserved populations, especially Hispanics and African Americans. These groups may face barriers to access and benefit from the UDN’s services. To address this gap, the UDN Miami Clinical Site, located in one of the most racially and ethnically diverse regions in the U.S., has been working to increase the inclusion and participation of individuals from these communities. The main objectives of this study are to recruit and enroll at least 40 additional participants annually; mainly from underrepresented populations, perform thorough clinical and research evaluations, and identify novel genetic and non-genetic causes that may explain their undiagnosed conditions. The study will also use a biorepository and conduct telehealth and in-person assessments using advanced medical facilities. The study aims to improve the diagnostic outcomes and reduce the disparities for minority and underserved populations in the UDN. So far, the study has achieved a diagnosis rate of 25% among the completed cases, as well as discovered several candidate genes and repeat expansions that are being validated. The study will continue to enroll and evaluate participants from Florida, which includes people from largely underrepresented groups."
10979070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Swallowing difficulties are extremely common and result in substantial morbidity, reduction in the quality of life,
and mortality related to malnutrition and complications from regurgitation and aspiration. Unfortunately, our
understanding regarding the pathophysiology of dysphagia and GERD has been hampered by focusing
predominantly on circular muscle activity and ignoring the essential biomechanical properties of the esophageal
wall that promote normal emptying. Our initial work explored the relationship between intrabolus pressure (IBP)
and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) compliance as a metric for outflow resistance. This work highlighted the
direct relationship between IBP and EGJ opening and was the foundation for the development of the
classification scheme utilized around the world to diagnose esophageal motor disorders: “the Chicago
Classification” (CC). Despite this improved understanding focused on bolus transit dynamics, there are still
significant gaps in our scientific understanding centered on the lack of a true correlate for symptoms, reliable
predictive models and effective treatments for Functional dysphagia, IEM and EGJOO. Given these limitations,
we have developed novel approaches that combine assessments of primary and secondary peristalsis (a
NeuroMyogenic Model of esophageal function). These will leverage our recent findings supporting the
importance of the esophageal response to distension in bolus clearance, noting that this response of the
esophageal wall to bolus retention or reflux is one of the most essential functions of the esophagus in preventing
complications of aspiration, or reflux injury. We will also include an assessment of esophageal geometry and
wall biomechanics (elasticity/dilatation) as these carry essential interactions with esophageal function that are
overlooked in the current diagnostic paradigms.
 In order to test our hypothesis that wall mechanics are a major determinant of esophageal diseases, we
had to develop new approaches and new technology to directly measure mechanical wall state, descending
inhibition and LES opening. Using impedance techniques combined with manometry, we are now capable of
assessing IBP and diameter changes across a space-time continuum (4D HRM). We also developed physics-
based hybrid diagnostics that include a FLIP technique to assess esophageal work and power during volumetric
distention (FLIP-MECH) and a fluoroscopy approach that simultaneously assesses esophageal diameter-
pressure relationships (Fluoro-MECH). We also developed a new approach, Interactive FLIP Panometry, which
facilitates an assessment of descending inhibition and the mechanism behind impaired LES opening. These
tools will allow us to expand our models to combine an assessment of neuromyogenic function simultaneously
with geometry. Our overarching goal will be to study well-defined patient populations (Functional Dysphagia,
IEM/GERD, EGJOO and Achalasia) before and after targeted interventions to test the NeuroMyogenic and
MechanoGeometric Model. This work will build upon the previous success of the CC and help advance the
evolution of the CC by defining new, relevant biomechanical physiomarkers of disease activity that can identify
new targets for therapeutic intervention and facilitate prediction of clinical outcomes."

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis in men (not including skin cancer) and has high survival rates
(98% at 5 years), resulting in an estimated 3.2M US men currently living with prostate cancer. However, data
shows follow up among prostate cancer patients remains a significant challenge. A recent study at Dana-
Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center (DF/BCC) demonstrated its novel Virtual Prostate Cancer Clinic
(VPCC) increased access to care for new patients by 1110% and expanded revenue by 174% in four years.
Leveraging knowledge gained by the VPCC’s preliminary studies and to address this challenge in the market,
Vizlitics will develop a Software-as-a-Service product on top of its existing Cancer Insights (CI) platform in
collaboration with its research partners at DF/BCC to serve US cancer centers and community oncologists.
Known as VIPCare, this new CDSS will automatically monitor, track, and optimally classify prostate cancer cases
for triage by applying advanced algorithms to curated medical data. The cloud-based platform will ingest and
curate cancer patient medical records, including unstructured notes and apply Markov Decision Process (MDP)
modeling of patient longitudinal data onto published surveillance guidelines. VIPCare will automatically retrieve
new medical record data to keep models current with the latest tests and encounters and then compute a
classification probability for a patient being in each care protocol (active surveillance, active treatment, or post-
treatment surveillance) and the probability of moving from one care protocol to another. In addition, the model
will provide a recommendation for whether the patient should be followed by an electronic, virtual or in-person
visit with an APP or physician. This approach will: 1) improve follow-up of surveillance patients by scaling an
already validated approach, 2) leverage MDP to reduce the need for manual data entry, medical record review
and hands-on patient management, and 3) improve allocation of clinic resources. Phase I Specific Aims are to:
1. Develop a MDP model by incorporating prostate cancer guidelines on longitudinal patient data. Using
retrospective patient data, the team will apply the MDP model to compute probabilities for current and future care
based on latest tests and medical record data. 2. An optimization algorithm will use the probability scores created
in Aim 1, patient preferences, and provider constraints to compute the triage recommendation for each patient.
The dashboard will give the overview status of each patient individually and the entire patient population globally.
3. In lab usability testing will be run as well as accuracy testing of the classification and optimization algorithms.
At the end of Phase I, the company will have demonstrated feasibility of VIPCare, achieving acceptable user
testing and computation model accuracy ≥80%. Phase II will be a real-time test pilot of VIPCare at a prostate
cancer clinic with additional technical enhancements in preparation for commercialization. Significant market
opportunities exist for a tool like VIPCare that can offer demonstrated cost savings, increased practice efficiency
and improved patient outcomes."
10990368,"ABSTRACT
Roughly 10% of births in the United States are premature and typically involve a stay in the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit (NICU), where infants endure painful procedures and periods of separation from their primary
caregiver. Premature births often occur in low socioeconomic status (SES) families. The NICU experience has
lasting effects on the brain and behavior, including increasing the risk of later developing substance use disorder
(SUD). This R34 will support the design of a better rat model of the NICU to begin to delineate mechanisms by
which this early adverse experience affects motivated behavior and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key
node in the reward network that is affected by other early stressors. Manipulations of early pain are typically
used to model the NICU, but here we will include other aspects of the NICU experience by combining early pain
with socioenvironmental factors associated with premature birth: resource scarcity and separation from the
primary caregiver. A feature of the planned activities is a focus on translation: testing developmentally
appropriate motivated behaviors that occur cross-species, leveraging human imaging data to inform rat imaging
studies, and utilizing an external advisory committee to get input from a range of experts, including those who
study prenatal stress and early pain in humans. Aim 1 will first engage our advisory committee to optimize our
proposed design of the NICU model. Then, using a longitudinal design, we will determine the effects of early
pain vs. the NICU model (combined pain, low resources, and separation) vs. control conditions in male and
female rats on social behavior across development: juvenile play and social motivation in adolescents and adults.
Given many people begin experimenting with drugs by first using cannabis in adolescence, we will next develop
an adolescent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) gummy self-administration procedure and begin to test if early pain
and/or the NICU model increases adolescent cannabis motivation compared to controls. Aim 2 will investigate
how the NICU model affects the cortical structure. We will leverage existing human neuroimaging data sets by
assessing how relevant variables (preterm birth, low SES) affect human cortical structure to guide our rat imaging
study design. Next, rat diffusion tensor imaging and 3D structural MRI will be used to assess changes in cortical
structure in juvenile, adolescent, and adult males and females following early pain, the NICU model, or control
rearing in a longitudinal design. Finally, we will engage in a hypothesis-generating activity by assessing DNA
methylation in the mPFC in adolescent rats following our early manipulations using cutting-edge long-read native
DNA sequencing for simultaneous profiling of 5mC, 5hmC, and 6mA in the same sample. This will reveal putative
mechanisms by which the NICU experience can have lasting consequences on mPFC development to be tested
in a subsequent R01. Together, the studies in this R34 will allow us to develop a more translational model of the
NICU experience and establish foundational data and an expert team to pursue future R01 proposals aimed at
identifying novel mechanisms by which a common form of adversity, a NICU stay, increases vulnerability to SUD."

Abstract
Social stress in humans increases the risk of mental health problems. Individuals who experience physical and/or
emotional bullying display anxiety, depression, and social avoidance. Despite the gender differences and
individual variance in stress-related mental disorders, most preclinical research on the effects of social stress
has been conducted on male subjects. Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is a rodent model of psychosocial
stress that causes fear-based social avoidance and anhedonia. We have developed direct physical (i.e., inter-
male and inter-female aggression) and witnessing mouse models of social avoidance. Using male and female
mouse models of social avoidance, we find that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective
cation (HCN) channels are increased in the dorsal hippocampus of susceptible male and female mice. Moreover,
the levels of HCN protein expression and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) are higher in susceptible female
mice than in susceptible male mice. Notably, behavioral responses to social defeat are different between male
and female mice. Consistent with these preclinical findings, HCN1 mRNA expression in isolated CA1 areas is
elevated in human patients with major depressive disorder. We hypothesize that hippocampal HCN channels
mediate sex-dependent behavioral coping and individual differences in social avoidance. To test this hypothesis,
we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the changes in neuronal activity
mediated by the HCN channels in the hippocampal CA1 neurons affect behavioral susceptibility and resilience
to social defeat. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the HCN channels in the hippocampal CA1 neurons
affects sex differences in behavioral coping with social defeat and individual differences in social avoidance. In
Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that estradiol promotes sex-dependent behavioral susceptibility and passive
coping with social defeat through HCN channels. Together, the results are expected to provide insights into the
novel molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying dendritic HCN channels that regulate stress coping and
individual differences in social defeat and offer novel therapeutic targets for stress-related mental disorders."

Stroke mortality has always been higher for Black Americans and for those living in the American Southeast, aka
the Stroke Belt. The REGARDS study has been examining racial and geographic differences in stroke incidence
and cognitive function (including cognitive impairment, cognitive decline and dementia) since 2003. This cohort
of 30,239 people from across the lower 48 United States has been active for more than 20 years with a 97%
annual retention rate and has generated >700 publications creating a truly unique scientific resource. Leveraging
the rich, expansive data collected by REGARDS will be critical to understand major societal changes and
epidemiologic transitions including: rise in obesity, COVID-19, and widening disparities due to social structures.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, America experienced an inflection point when the long-persisting
improvement in life expectancy stagnated and began reversing. Life expectancy has been declining since 2014
in part driven by increased stroke mortality. This alarming trend places the US as discordant from most developed
nations as most have continued to experience increasing life expectancy. The REGARDS study is ideal for
understanding how racial disparities in stroke and stroke risk factors such as cognitive decline, biomarkers of
brain injury, social determinants of health, diet, and blood pressure are contributing to wider declines in life
expectancy in the US. Through this new round of funding, we propose to create the REGARDS-2 cohort
consisting of 8000 participants followed since baseline (2003-07, born between born 1908-1960) and 12000 new
younger participants aged 45-64 (born between 1961 and 1980). Aim 1 examines the role of secular changes in
stroke and dementia risk factors comparing 15,326 individuals who were 45-64 in 2003-2007 (middle aged Baby
Boomer Generation) with 12,000 individuals who are 45-64 in 2024-2027 (middle aged Generation X). We will
further explore how changes in risk factors in middle aged adults are driving increases in stroke incidence and
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). For Aim 2, we will build on the large biomarker repository
to examine whether emerging ADRD blood-based biomarkers are associated with incident ADRD and stroke.
To support bi-directional communication with the REGARDS research community and the REGARDS participant
community, we propose an Infrastructure Aim to establish a participant advisory board and structured mentoring
for scientists, particularly those from backgrounds under-represented in research, interested in working in health
disparities in stroke and dementia. The REGARDS study has been and will continue to be a strong platform for
developing future scientists interested in understanding and addressing health disparities in Black and White
Americans."
10985627,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Added sugar (AS) is a critically important dietary target for intervention in adolescents; it contains excess
calories with no nutritional value and is independently associated with chronic disease risk. Adolescents
consume more AS than any other age group and are at a unique phase in the life course where improving diet
could have a significant influence on overall health into adulthood. However, capturing dietary change remains
a paramount challenge in the field of nutrition and this is particularly true for overconsumed nutrients like AS
that are highly susceptible to reporting error and social desirability bias. The challenge of dietary self-report is
also pronounced in behavioral trials where issues like participant burden, repeated measures, and small
sample sizes have significant impacts on the ability to accurately assess outcomes. The carbon stable isotope
ratio (CIR) is a low-burden and valid measure of AS and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake that
warrants additional investigation in dietary interventions. Most of the evidence on CIR to date is derived from
controlled feeding studies and observational trials using blood and hair CIR. Breath CIR has recently been
validated as a measure of short and long-term AS intake and provides an exciting new avenue to explore AS
intervention adherence and effectiveness in behavioral trials. Thus, the purpose of this R03 is to examine CIR
from breath as an indicator of intervention adherence (i.e., short-term intake) and intervention effectiveness
(i.e., change over time). Additionally, this study aims to assess the differential feasibility, acceptability, and
sensitivity to change among CIR from breath, blood, and hair samples to inform work in future trials. This R03
study will be mapped onto a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in an ongoing K01 study. Adolescents (n=70)
12-16 years will be randomized to a 12-week behavioral intervention to reduce AS intake (n=35), or a
nutritional education comparison (n=35). This R03 study will 1) Assess the feasibility and efficacy of using daily
breath CIR (fasting morning, postprandial afternoon, and evening) to capture intervention adherence via
repeated sampling over 12-weeks (at baseline, and in weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12); 2) Examine AS intervention
effectiveness based on changes in breath CIR from baseline to end-of-intervention (12-weeks) between
intervention and control participants; and 3) Compare feasibility, acceptability, and sensitivity to change of
breath, blood, and hair CIR to capture change in AS over 12 weeks. This R03 will enhance the impact of the
PI's existing K01 by adding innovative breath CIR measures and analyses, which will provide robust evidence
for objectively assessing AS intervention adherence and effectiveness. Additionally, this study will test
assessment approaches that could reduce participant burden and eliminate reliance on dietary self-report,
resulting in more efficacious strategies for populations at greatest risk of diet-related health disparities.
Findings will facilitate the PI's research trajectory to advance the science of dietary assessment methodology
and expand the evidence for the use of objective biomarkers in behavioral nutrition interventions."

T cell-mediated rejection remains a significant barrier to improving long-term allograft survival,
underscoring the need for a better understanding of allogeneic T cell responses. Our recent
discovery that alloreactive T cells differentiate first into TCF1+Ly108+ effector precursor T (TEP)
cells, which then give rise to TCF1‒CXCR6+ terminal effectors, offers a new perspective on
eliminating undesired allogeneic T cell responses by understanding and targeting alloreactive
TEP cells. To accomplish this, we aim to induce TEP cell dysfunction by targeting essential
transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic regulators in T cells. Our studies revealed that
deleting the transcription factor IRF4, the epigenetic enzyme EZH2, or the glycolytic enzyme
LDHA in T cells eliminates the effector differentiation potential of TCF1+Ly108+ TEP cells,
preventing them from becoming TCF1‒CXCR6+ terminal effectors. This leads to TEP cell
dysfunction and heart transplant acceptance without the need for immunosuppressive
treatments. Furthermore, we found that transient treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor alone
achieves heart transplant acceptance. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that inducing
TEP cell dysfunction is critical for achieving transplant acceptance. To test our hypothesis, we
have outlined two specific aims. Aim 1 is to investigate whether the ablation of Irf4, Ezh2, or
Ldha induces transplant acceptance by driving “irreversible” TEP cell dysfunction. Aim 2 is to
test the hypothesis that inducing TEP cell dysfunction promotes transplant acceptance in wild-
type recipients. These studies will offer insights into the induction of TEP cell dysfunction, which
has crucial clinical implications for transplantation."
10986821,"SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Astrocytes are the most diverse glial cell type and maintain essential interactions with endothelial cells to form
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB plays a major role in CNS homeostatic function, while dysregulation of
the astrocytic BBB contributes to a spectrum of neurological disorders, ranging from neurodevelopmental and
degenerative diseases to CNS injury and malignancy. Particularly, pathologic astrocyte-BBB interactions
contribute to ischemic stroke, which is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S. However, the mechanisms
underlying maintenance of BBB integrity, both in health and in diseases such as stroke, remain poorly defined.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate novel targets and associated signaling pathways influencing
normal astrocyte-BBB function and to leverage this knowledge to define key mechanisms for BBB disruption
after ischemic cerebral stroke. This proposal focuses on an astrocyte-enriched sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter
1, Slc4a4, which was previously identified as a glial-specific regulator of both intracellular and extracellular pH.
While pH homeostasis is essential for brain function and patients carrying Slc4a4 variants can suffer ischemic
stroke, a regulatory role of Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity remains unknown. To begin addressing this
knowledge gap, we generated new transgenic mouse lines that temporally ablate Slc4a4 in astrocytes. Using this
genetic mouse model, we showed that loss of Slc4a4 significantly reduces astrocytic morphological complexity
and generates enlarged blood vessels with disrupted endothelial junctions. Our profiling analyses of astrocytic
Slc4a4-deficient mice and conditioned media of Slc4a4 ablated astrocytes revealed increased CCL2 production
and secretion coupled with dysregulated arginine-nitro oxide (NO) metabolism, further supporting a crucial role
for Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity. Using an ischemic stroke mouse model, we found loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates
stroke-induced motor dysfunction and increases infarct area coupled with impaired reactive gliosis which results
in BBB disruption, which is rescued by inhibition of CCL2 in vivo. Based on these preliminary data, our central
hypothesis is that Slc4a4 functions to maintain astrocyte-BBB interactions and prevent progressive BBB leakage
in ischemic stroke, in part by inhibiting the chemokine CCL2. To address our hypothesis, we will first determine
how Slc4a4 regulates astrocyte morphology and physiology in the adult brain (Aim 1). Second, we will determine
the role of CCL2 in Slc4a4-dependent BBB maintenance in the adult brain (Aim 2). Upon completion, these
studies will establish whether and how Slc4a4-deficient astrocytes influence anatomical and physiological
properties of astrocytes, and will elucidate how Slc4a4 regulates astrocytic modulation of endothelial cell and
BBB integrity via NO metabolism that drive astrocytic CCL2 signaling in the adult brain. Lastly, we will define
the Slc4a4 pathway in the maintenance of BBB integrity following ischemic stroke (Aim 3). Together, elucidating
the Slc4a4 pathway could reveal fundamental mechanisms controlling astrocyte morphology, physiology, and
secreted molecules, and it will advance our understanding of astrocyte-BBB interactions after stroke."

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) is predicted
to nearly triple to 152.8 million cases worldwide by 2050. Women have double the risk versus men, and as
early as midlife, Black individuals have nearly double the risk versus White individuals. For women, the midlife
(~40-60 yrs.) is characterized by the menopausal transition, accompanied by the loss of potentially neuro-
protective and cardio-protective sex hormones. Earlier menopause means earlier exposure to decreased sex
hormones and may increase AD/ADRD risk. Further, reproductive surgeries (hysterectomy and/or bilateral
oophorectomy) can prematurely induce menopause, resulting in the sudden and often complete loss of
hormones, and may be a modifiable risk factor for AD/ADRD. Data suggest that Black women have earlier
menopause than White women – approximately 1 year for natural and up to 10 years earlier for surgical
menopause. Historical and existing racial bias may contribute to higher prevalence and timing of surgical
menopause in Black women. The few studies of menopause and long-term AD/ADRD risk are limited due to
potential bias in the measurement of menopausal age/type, bias due to selection into later life studies,
particularly affecting Black women, and little data to assess relations to disparities. The proposed project will
comprehensively assess the contribution of early menopause to overall risk and Black-White disparities in
AD/ADRD diagnoses (K99) and development (R00) by harmonizing data from 25,051 women (30% Black) in 3
cohorts: Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN, menopausal transition to 75+ yrs.), Women’s
Health Initiative (post-menopause to 80+ yrs.) and Cardiovascular Health Study (65+ yrs.). Harmonizing
cohorts with adequate sample size to gauge disparities and “gold-standard” measurements of menopause
(SWAN) and AD/ADRD (adjudicated diagnoses, neurocognitive tests over time, and neuroimaging markers of
AD/ADRD) while applying methods that I previously developed to account for selection bias, will address prior
limitations. This proposal will ensure I get the training I need as a lifecourse social epidemiologist to work
independently with AD/ADRD data, to further address bias limitations in lifecourse data, and to estimate causal
impacts on disparities. Through the K99/R00 award, I will leverage the expertise of my mentors and my prior
training in single cohort longitudinal methods and lifecourse disparities to gain additional training in 1)
AD/ADRD diagnoses and development, 2) multi-cohort harmonization/pooling, and 3) causal intervention
modeling. Completion of this proposal will result in scientific presentations, publications, and preliminary data
to successfully compete for R01 funding that examines cardio-metabolic mediators of reproductive aging and
AD/ADRD disparities. Results will elucidate unique midlife targets for prevention in women; supporting a
potential paradigm shift for gerontologists and clinicians, explicating the importance of maintenance of
reproductive organs and reproductive aging’s role in women’s, especially Black women’s, long-term health."

A major limitation of dopaminergic therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD) is motor response “wearing-off” within
a few hours after the dose. Although the field has focused on prolonging the short-duration (acute) response of
each dose using more persistent drug preparations and delivery methods, these pharmacological approaches
have limited and short-term benefits. Wearing-off is driven by a decline in the duration of benefit of each dose,
due to the decay of the long-duration response (LDR) that lowers the trough level performance. We recently
showed the importance of task-specific learning and the striatopallidal pathway in LDR induction and decay.
Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that repeated optogenetic stimulations of globus pallidus externa
(GPe) parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons – part of the striatopallidal pathway – induced long-term rescue:
mice showed improved locomotion when reintroduced to the same open-field environment ≥24 h after the final
stimulation session. This resembled LDR induced by repeated L-DOPA treatments. However, while LDR
induced by L-DOPA was selective to the induction context, LDR induced by stimulation of GPe PV+ neurons
transferred to a new context. Thus, repeated stimulation of GPe PV+ neurons conferred long-term motoric
benefits but may also reduce discrimination learning. This project aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying
these properties of LDR. GPe PV+ neurons consist of two subpopulations: those that project to substantia nigra
vs. to parafasicular thalamus. We will establish how the activities of these two GPe subpopulations are altered
during parkinsonian locomotion impairment and during different phases of LDR, both for LDR induced by
L-DOPA and by GPe PV+ neuronal stimulation. We will also examine whether perturbing these two GPe
subpopulations results in dissociable effects on long-lasting locomotion rescue vs. its context selectivity. This
project will advance our knowledge in the role of the striatopallidal pathway in mediating LDR, and elucidate
both therapeutic utility and potential side effects of GPe deep brain stimulation."

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or infant chronic lung disease, is among the most devastating
complications of preterm birth. BPD affects half of surviving extremely preterm infants, is associated with life-
long deficits in health and cognition, and carries enormous societal burden and cost. Strikingly, there are no
therapies shown to improve outcomes for infants with BPD. Our research seeks to resolve this care gap.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is diagnosed in >40% of infants with BPD. Through aspiration and
neurogenic mechanisms, GERD exacerbates lung disease in BPD by induction of bronchospasm, hypoxemia,
airway injury, infection, and chronic lung inflammation. Unfortunately, there are no proven safe and effective
ways to treat GERD in infants. Acid suppression and GI promotility drugs are ineffective and carry significant
risks. Surgical fundoplication is invasive and often inappropriate for infants with unstable lung disease.
Conversely, transpyloric tube feeding is easily initiated and has been shown to reduce aerodigestive
sequelae of GER in older children and adults. Unfortunately, the safety and efficacy of transpyloric feeding in
BPD is uncertain and the limited infant data are conflicting. Our preliminary data show variable contribution of
GERD to lung disease in BPD and significant heterogeneity in response to transpyloric feeding. In a recent
randomized trial of alternating 4d periods of transpyloric and gastric feeding in 15 infants with BPD, we showed
that transpyloric feeding reduced hypoxemia and FiO2 need in some infants but worsened these in others.
These findings demand identification of evidence-based means to individualize feeding route selection and
GERD management in preterm infants with BPD.
A key first step towards achieving this goal is to determine whether transpyloric feeding safely and effectively
reduces GER in infants. To do so, we propose a randomized trial that will compare moderate duration (2wk)
transpyloric vs. gastric tube feeding in very preterm infants (n=60) with grade 2-3 BPD. Serial gold-standard
esophageal pH-impedance testing will be used to objectively define pre-trial GER and in-study treatment
response. Motivated by our prior data suggesting heterogeneity of treatment effects, we will determine whether
the tolerability and physiologic efficacy of transpyloric feeding varies by pre-trial GER severity. Common GER
and lung aspiration biomarkers will be measured and compared to objective pH/MII and clinical outcome data.
The results of this study will immediately inform evidence-based GER diagnosis and feeding practices in BPD
and establish the foundation required to conduct a definitive, multicenter trial of prolonged transpyloric feeding
in chronically tube fed preterm infants with grade 2-3 BPD who are at high risk for GER-induced lung injury."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common, slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease, resulting in de-
mentia and eventually death. More than six million Americans are affected by AD and more than 50 million
people suffer with dementia worldwide. The pathology of AD is characterized by an increased production and
reduced clearance of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) within the affected brain regions. Aβ accumulation leads to
subsequent increase of hyperphosphorylated intraneuronal tau, which is followed by synaptic impairment, neu-
roinflammation, functional neural changes, and ultimately neuronal death. AD symptoms progress from mild
memory loss to severe cognitive and executive impairment at the latest stages of the disease. Identifying mo-
lecular mechanisms influencing disease related protein pathways and networks is of ultimate importance to
broaden the understanding of the complexity of AD and to advance the development of therapeutics. Gene ex-
pression studies in human subjects and animal models identified many changes in RNA abundance associated
with the development and complexity of AD. However, the full spectrum of AD-associated gene expression
regulation in a cell type-specific pattern is still not well understood. Here, we will examine alternative polyad-
enylation (APA) of mRNAs and how it results in downstream functional changes leading to AD. In affected
mRNAs, APA regulates both the functional diversity of open reading frames (ORFs), which alters the functional
protein produced, and the length of mRNA 3¢ untranslated regions (UTRs), which controls the stability, transla-
tion, and localization of transcripts within the cell. APA is most apparent in astrocytes, where we identified a
profound shortening of ORFs and UTRs of many key mRNAs involved in the etiology of AD. We propose that
such shortening in a cell type-specific manner contributes to the pathology of AD by modulating the production,
removal, and toxicity of Aβ in addition to global changes of neural cell physiology. The goals of this project are
two-fold: 1) To identify APA genes and pathways associated with the underlying pathology of AD using our
computational pipeline by interrogating existing AD-related single nucleus RNA-Seq datasets; and 2) To vali-
date our findings on prioritized APA genes in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer’s disease and non-symptomatic
donors using RNAscope in situ hybridization technology. Successful completion of this research project will
provide insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and contrib-
uting to progression of AD. It will also provide the foundation to advance innovative pharmacological interven-
tions. Finally, these results will build a foundation for analysis of numerous existing and future high-throughput
sequencing datasets to study the role of APA in not only AD but also additional neurodegenerative disorders."

Chlamydia trachomatis is the obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the most prevalent STI worldwide. It
is estimated that over 1.6 million of new cases of Chlamydia occurred in 2021 in the United States. Although
most Chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, “silent” infections can lead to severe sequelae such as pelvic
inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Current consensus is that prophylactic measures,
such as a vaccine, are needed to flatten the ever-rising infection curve of Chlamydia. To date, there is no
licensed human Chlamydia vaccine available, and only one subunit vaccine candidate completed a phase I
clinical trial for safety. Understanding how protective immunity is developed in the female reproductive tract
(FRT) against Chlamydia is essential for developing a vaccine. Prior research has established the essential
role of CD4 T cells in protective adaptive immunity against Chlamydia. In contrast, the early innate defense
mechanisms in the FRT are much less well understood in vivo. Our recent studies suggested that innate
IFNg production during early Chlamydia infection is essential for preventing systemic bacterial dissemination.
Moreover, increasing evidence suggest that innate immune cells can acquire immune memory characteristics
through proper “training”. In this application, we propose to (i) explore the landscape of early immune
responses to Chlamydia in the FRT and characterize the heterogenous Thy1+ cell population essential for
protection; and (ii) characterize the myeloid cell infiltrates and determine whether trained immunity induced by
BCG contribute to protective immunity and/or immunopathology during Chlamydia infection. We anticipate that
identifying cellular populations and their effector functions responsible for protective immunity vs pathologic
outcomes in the FRT will provide rational support for developing vaccines for STIs."

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by bacterial pathogen Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum). Alt-
hough it can be effectively treated with a single dose of long-acting penicillin, syphilis is re-emerging as a global
public health problem. According to the CDC, the cases of adult and congenital syphilis in the U.S. increased
74% and 203% from 2017 to 2021, respectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better preventive
measures for syphilis. Currently, most syphilis cases are diagnosed based on serum antibody tests that have
been used in some fashion since the 1930s. In addition to imperfect specificity and sensitivity, serum antibody
tests are unable to reliably distinguish between current and past infections, leading to under diagnosis and over
treatment. The overall objective of this project is to develop a one-step, rapid, and low-cost point-of-care (POC)
diagnostic assay for active T. pallidum infection. This POC assay is predicated on the recently developed
Nano2RED technology, an in-solution assay pipeline that transduces antigen binding signals into physical ag-
gregation of binder-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in < 30 minutes with atto- to pico-molar sensitivity.
In this study, we will first engineer specific T. pallidum antigen binders templated on designed ankyrin repeat
protein (DARPin), a versatile low-cost antibody-mimic protein scaffold with high tolerance to harsh/denaturing
conditions and long storage stability (Aim 1). Next, we will create DARPin-based Nano2RED (DARPin-RED)
and determine its sensitivity and specificity against a panel of syphilis patient samples (Aim 2). Since DARPins
can be easily engineered to bind diverse targets, the successful completion of this project should yield not only
a novel syphilis diagnostic assay for active T. pallidum bacteremia, but also a plug-and-play assay platform for
potentially many other infections and diseases."

Background: Studies have revealed that obese individuals have longer survival on BRAF-targeted therapy
(BRAF/MEKi) when compared to those with normal weight. This phenomenon, termed the ""obesity paradox,""
remains without a mechanistic explanation.
Hypothesis/Objective: Our goal is to uncover the mechanisms behind the obesity paradox in melanoma and
identify therapeutic targets. We propose that adiponectin, a key adipocyte-secreted adipokine, plays a crucial
role by increasing fatty acid uptake within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In obesity, adiponectin levels are
reduced compared to normal weight individuals. We hypothesize that adiponectin decreases the effectiveness
of BRAF/MEKi by increasing melanoma tumor fatty acid uptake in the TME.
Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will characterize the role of adiponectin within the TME of melanoma tumors in
obese and non-obese mice and assess changes following treatment with BRAF/MEKi. In Aim 2, we will
determine how sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition alters adiponectin release, fatty acid
utilization and affects BRAF/MEKi responses.
Study Design: We will employ a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model in C57BL/6J mice implanted with
YUMMER1.7 cells to compare adipokine release, fatty acid oxidation, adipocyte transcriptome, and immune
responses between obese and non-obese mice treated with BRAF/MEKi. We will use an adiponectin knockout
mouse model to explore the role of adiponectin through exogenous delivery versus its absence under similar
conditions. Lastly, we will evaluate BRAF/MEKi responses in the DIO model coupled with SGLT2 inhibition, a
common diabetes medication with effects on fatty acid oxidation.
Impact: Our project diverges from conventional research by focusing on obesity as a favorable condition to
emulate. We will elucidate how obesity alters the TME and how adiponectin affects melanoma responses to
BRAF/MEKi. We anticipate discovering a unique therapeutic target that can be quickly translated into clinical
practice.

Kilohertz sacral root block for bladder emptying after spinal cord injury
Neurogenic bladder and bowel post-SCI hugely impact quality of life and remains important unmet challenges.
Neurogenic bladder and bowel are the result of impaired control/coordination between the bladder and urethral
sphincter. In particular, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) results in urethral sphincter activity that obstructs
the bladder outlet during bladder emptying. Current treatment approaches, which include such things as timed
voiding strategies, catheters, pharmaceuticals, and surgical interventions, do not sufficiently address the
problem. Sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) has been used to provide clinically effective bladd er emptying
for individuals with SCI. SARS activates the motor nerves of the bladder to evoke bladder contractions for
emptying. For individuals with DSD, reflex urethral sphincter activity can still impede bladder emptying.
Therefore, these reflex urethral contractions must be eliminated. Posterior rhizotomy, which is cutting the spinal
nerves that carry sensory signals, has been combined with SARS to abolish reflex contractions of the sphincter
and facilitate emptying. However, many individuals choose not to undergo the combination of SARS with
rhizotomy because the rhizotomy abolishes any remaining pelvic sensation and desirable reflexes, including
reflex sexual functions such as penile erection. One promising approach uses high frequency stimulation to b lock
the motor efferent neurons that drive urethral sphincter contractions. This technique has been tested via
pudendal nerve stimulation to reduce urethral sphincter pressures and promote bladder emptying. The goal of
this project is to determine the effect of sacral root stimulation frequency on contractile function of lower urinary
tract and bowel organs in order to evaluate the potential for SARS to improve bladder and bowel emptying
efficiency for individuals with spinal cord injury. In acute terminal pig experiments, we will measure continuous
bladder, urethral sphincter, rectal, and anal sphincter pressures in response to SARS at varying frequencies
from 20-10,000 Hz. We will also measure bladder emptying volumes and rates."

CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that holds significant importance in public health due to the following factors: 1)
CCR5 is the primary co-receptor for HIV infection; 2) approximately 1% of individuals with European ancestry
worldwide possess a natural deficiency in CCR5; 3) an FDA-approved CCR5 antagonist exists for HIV treatment
and is currently undergoing clinical trials for potential use in various chronic diseases. Our research has revealed
that the absence of CCR5 leads to heightened vulnerability to West Nile virus (WNV), a neurotropic flavivirus, in
both human subjects and mouse models. Additionally, we and other researchers have observed a similar
susceptibility to other neurotropic pathogens, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis,
cerebral malaria, and toxoplasma gondii. While these studies have been conducted using mice deficient in Ccr5,
further in-depth investigations have been limited by the lack of appropriate tools for mouse experimentation.
Through this proposal, our aim is to create a floxed Ccr5 reporter mouse and develop a collection of specific
antibodies targeting Ccr5. These resources will facilitate research on CCR5's function, expression patterns, and
its involvement in various inflammatory conditions and diseases."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common life-long neuromotor
physical mobility. CP affects about1 in 345 newborns each year
 condition that permanently affects children's
in the United States. The etiology of CP is
complex and multifactorial. We know that CP is caused by lesions occurring in the developing brain, but what
risk factors trigger the developing brain damage remain largely unknown. Newborn asphyxia at delivery only
presents in less than 10% of cases. While ambient/household environmental risk factors for CP have long been
suspected and discussed, few studies have been conducted to evaluate environmental exposure effects on CP
development. Recently, a seasonal pattern of CP occurrence was observed in our California study, where air
pollution exposure was suspected to play an important role. Air pollution is one of the most widespread
environmental pollutants, and the literature has consistently suggested maternal exposure to ambient air
pollution during pregnancy can affect major perinatal predictors of CP, including maternal preeclampsia, preterm
birth, and Apgar scores. Moreover, emerging research shows air pollution affects cognitive, neurobehavioral,
and motor function deficits in childhood, as well as increases the risk for white matter injury and thinning of the
cerebral cortex in the developing brain which are highly relevant to CP etiology. The collective set of scientific
evidence points toward a need to thoroughly examine whether air pollution exposure poses a risk to CP
development. Our proposed study is novel and will be the first and largest population-based study of CP and air
pollution to date. We will use records from the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) to identify
children who were born during 2000-2015 and diagnosed with CP in California. We expect to identify ~10,000
CP cases and we will utilize a case-cohort design and select 20% of births in California during the study period
(N=~1.6M births) as the population controls. We will apply a sibling-matched analysis to triangulate the main
results. We will utilize a newly developed land-use-regression (LUR) model with a high temporal (daily) and
spatial resolution (100m X 100m) to estimate gestational exposures to three major ambient air pollutants (PM2.5,
NO2, and O3), study the associations between maternal pregnancy exposures and CP risk using single and multi-
pollutant analyses, and explore the critical time window of exposure. Moreover, we will perform causal mediation
analyses to examine to what extent the racial/social disparities of CP in California may be explained by
environmental disparities in exposure to air pollution, and whether a specific pregnancy complication or adverse
birth outcome mediates the association between air pollution exposures and CP risk. Findings from this project
will advance our knowledge of suspected environmental risk factors of CP, and possibly inform risk identification
and primary prevention of CP. Results from this project will be critical for future research strategies to examine
environmental hypotheses of CP, possibly using an approach integrating biomarkers and active data collection."

The approval of anti-PD1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies for those with non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has demonstrated that immunotherapies can generate robust responses for a
subset of patients with advanced disease. However, while nearly 45% of patients demonstrate a major
pathological response to ICB, the median progression-free survival for NSCLC patients remains dismal at around
7 months. It is now well documented that persistent interferon gamma (IFNy) cytokine pathway signaling plays
a paradoxical role within the tumor microenvironment and has been associated with both resistance and
response to ICB leading us to believe that there is greater nuance to dissect within this pathway. Accordingly,
this cytokine pathway is quite complex as IFNy stimulates the expression of ~200 hallmark interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs); thus, it is still unclear how the majority of ISGs influence tumor immunity as it has been difficult to
study this pathway in a relevant biologic context. Using a novel functional genomics platform developed in our
lab (Perturb-map) my sponsor lab was able to knock-out (KO) 35 cytokine genes in parallel in the KP mouse
model of NSCLC and investigate spatial and temporal phenotypes at a single-cell resolution. It was found that
KO of Socs1, a negative regulator of the IFNy pathway, caused an overt growth advantage and a paradoxical
increase in both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell infiltration into tumors. Further, these tumors were found to be more
sensitive to PD-L1 blockade than wildtype tumors. We hypothesize that Socs1 KO causes chronic upregulation
of tumor cell IFNy signaling leading to cytokine-mediated infiltration of the TME which is followed by an increase
in immune-inhibitory signal expression on tumor cells such as PD-L1. In Aim 1, we will investigate the influence
of Socs1 KO on tumor immune-composition of the TME and tumor phenotype using Perturb-map and
transcriptomics. We will then corroborate these data with CITE-seq of human lung cancer specimens to further
explore the role of SOCS1 in human malignancy. In Aim 2, we will use Perturb-map to KO all 162 ISGs and
determine how each impacts tumor immunity in the context of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and TME
biology at depth. These experiments will include assessment of immune & stromal recruitment, tumor
organization & differentiation, and unbiased analysis by spatial transcriptomics to identify mechanistic programs
controlled by each ISG."

At least 60 million (one in every five) Americans live in rural areas, among whom harbor a disproportionately
high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The worsening disparity in CVD mortality between rural versus
urban America has created a need to improve our understanding of atherosclerotic resilience for the promotion
of cardiovascular health in rural communities. The absence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly
specific marker of atherosclerotic resilience, as CAC=0 is consistently associated with an exceedingly low risk
of future CVD events and mortality regardless of traditional risk factor burden. Despite the prognostic
importance of CAC=0, the risk factors underlying this protective phenotype are not well understood, especially
in rural populations. To address this knowledge gap, we propose the first epidemiologic study to determine the
prevalence and correlates of CAC=0 in rural communities. We will leverage clinical and socioeconomic
measures, as well as non-contrast cardiac computed tomography among 4,000 participants (44% White, 45%
Black, 10% Hispanic) enrolled in the Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal (RURAL) Cohort Study.
Notably, RURAL is a NHLBI-funded study that examines cardiovascular health in rural communities across the
Southeastern United States, providing an ideal setting for the proposed work. The primary definition of
atherosclerotic resilience will be CAC=0, but we will also examine absence of thoracic aortic calcium and a
normal ankle-brachial index for a more comprehensive definition of atherosclerotic resilience in secondary
analyses. In Aim 1, we will determine the prevalence of atherosclerotic resilience (CAC=0) according to age
(<45 versus >45 years old), sex (women versus men), and race (black versus non-black) in rural persons.
Regression models will calculate prevalence ratios for CAC=0. We will then use collected information on
clinical CVD risk factors, diet, physical activity, and psychosocial adversity, to determine their association with
CAC=0 in rural participants (Aim 2). Multivariable regression models with sophisticated adjustment strategies
(sequential, individual, and leave-one-out) will calculate prevalence ratios to study the individual and combined
relative impact of clinical, lifestyle, and psychosocial measures on differences in atherosclerotic resilience
across groups of age, sex, and race. We will then contrast prevalence ratios and the effect estimate
attenuation after performing the various adjustment strategies. In sub-aims of Aims 1 and 2, we will perform the
above analyses for CAC burden (CAC 1-99, CAC 100-299, CAC >300) and premature CAC (any CAC among
individuals <45 years old or >90th percentile according to age, sex, and race) to facilitate a better
understanding of atherosclerotic resilience. In total, the proposed research will provide important insights into
the biopsychosocial pathways underlying atherosclerotic resilience, and aid in understanding the disparities in
cardiovascular health among rural communities."

Trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals experience mental and physical health disparities compared to cisgender
peers, such as higher rates of depression and anxiety, increased risk for suicide, substance use and poor
physical health. These disparities are associated with internalized anti-TNB stigma, discriminatory interpersonal
encounters, and systemic and institutional barriers to accessing necessary social, financial, educational, and
health resources, and are exacerbated among TNB People of Color (POC) and those with fewer resources.
Research across populations indicates that social support has multiple beneficial effects, including mitigating
adverse mental health outcomes and promoting well-being. There is a critical need to identify the most effective
types of social support for all TNB individuals, particularly those facing the greatest barriers to societal institutions
and resources. Using community-engaged and innovative approaches to rigorously over-sample TNB POC, we
will identify within-group differences in the specific forms social support that promote health and mitigate risk
across TNB communities. Data from a total of 1299 TNB individuals diverse in race and ethnicity will be collected
across several studies using multiple methods (e.g., qualitative interviews and focus groups; ecological
momentary assessment, longitudinal survey research) to develop and validate a multi-faceted social support
measure and test its function within an intersectional minority stress theory-derived longitudinal model. The
overall objective of this proposed research is to take the critical step toward this long-term goal by advancing
knowledge of social support as a mechanism by which to reduce anxiety, depression, and suicide risk, promote
well-being among TNB individuals, and to develop the measurement tools necessary to investigate their impact
on mental health and well-being over time and in context. This project includes the following three specific aims:
(1) Use community engaged approaches, we will collect data to increase in-depth understanding of how TNB
individuals experience and use social support to address adverse mental health concerns, (2) Develop and
validate a multifaceted measure of social support for TNB individuals for use in research and clinical settings,
and (3) Longitudinally assess the effects of social support in a minority stress model of TNB mental health. Data
( focus groups, individual interviews with community leaders, and daily diary social contacts logs) will be collected
to inform essential domains of social support for TNB people [Aim 1]. This information will be integrated into the
development of a multifaceted social support measure and cutting-edge network-based psychometric analyses
will be used to validate the measure with a sample of 1000 TNB participants [Aim 2]. Longitudinal survey data
from 1000 TNB adults at three time points to test the strength of direct and moderating effects of various
dimensions of social support on mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicidality) and mitigating mental health
risk associated with anti-TNB stigma [Aim 3]."

 In the past, nearly all clinical and research proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of
human brain metabolism have focused on the resonances upfield (UF) from the water signal. However, over
the last few years it has been demonstrated that there are signals downfield (DF) from water that can be
visualized using appropriate techniques, which may contain important metabolic information. We have recently
shown that it is possible to map these signals throughout the human brain at 3T using 3D magnetic resonance
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Furthermore, the clinical applicability of this technique would be significantly
enhanced if it were possible to simultaneously map both UF and DF peaks at the same time.
 In this proposal, a new pulse sequence will be developed for DF-MRSI which will have improved sensitivity
and excitation profiles compared to our current approach. Rigor and reproducibility will be carefully assessed;
the sensitivity and reproducibility of this new approach will be compared to our previously developed DF-MRSI
methodology in 10 healthy subjects scanned at two time points. In addition, assignment of DF metabolite
peaks will be investigated in detail using multiple metabolite solutions scanned under carefully controlled
physiological conditions.
 This novel pulse sequence may also be used for UF-MRSI acquisitions. Reproducibility and congruence
with conventional UF-MRSI acquisition methods will be established, again by the study of 10 healthy
volunteers at two time points. Finally, simultaneous UF- and DF-MRSI will be implemented with optimal
sensitivity for both sides of the spectrum. Again, sensitivity and reproducibility will be compared to sequential
UF- and DF-MRSI measurements made in the same total scan time in 10 healthy subjects at two time points.
 In parallel with the pulse sequence development and data acquisition aims, we will also continue to
develop and disseminate our MRSI post-processing methods as part of our open source ‘Osprey’ software
package, which is available to the clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging communities."
10978385,"Project Summary
The term “Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P)” encompasses a variety of clinical presentations that
collectively represent one of the most common human birth defects. For each patient, the impact can also be
significant. The severity of a patient’s clinical presentation is the major determinant of the duration and
frequency of significant surgical intervention and long-term clinical care. Considerable progress has been
made over the last few decades to determine the genes responsible for syndromic forms of CL/P. However,
the low penetrance and variability in presentation pose challenges when counseling families about recurrence
risks, as it is currently impossible to predict whether a child will be born with CL/P or how severe the
presentation might be regardless of whether a genetic predisposition is known. This new proposal builds on
important new observations and exciting preliminary data on established mouse models of CL/P to begin to
dissect the factors that influence the cleft penetrance and severity in embryos that are genetically predisposed
to CL/P. Specifically, this project will address the role of maternal diet (specifically vitamin A) as a modifier of
genetic susceptibility, severity of presentation and in utero correction prior to birth, as well as investigate the
basis for the left bias in unilateral cleft presentations. Although vitamin A and its derivatives have long been
implicated as a risk factor in CL/P, this project will exploit a novel mouse mutant background that overcomes
the limitations of prior animal model studies such as the need for excessive, non-physiologic levels of vitamin A
and unnatural routes of administration. Furthermore, we test the impact on two distinct underlying genetic
susceptibilities. The successful demonstration of modifying roles for these factors could ultimately have a
significant impact on patient counselling and potentially open up the possibility of developing simple and
effective interventional and preventative maternal dietary interventions such as personalized dietary
supplementation for mothers carrying CL/P risk alleles, or crop biofortification approaches for whole
populations where dietary deficiencies and genetic risk factors are known. Such approaches could have a
profound impact on the incidence of NS-CL/P, much like the successes seen for maternal folic acid
supplementation for reducing the risk of neural tube defects."
10978384,"Nucleotide metabolism is effectively targeted by anti-cancer agents, but their use is limited by toxicity to non-
transformed cells, especially anti-cancer immune cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that a more complete
understanding of nucleotide metabolism—from sensing mechanisms to the response to nucleotide depletion—
will enable sophisticated anti-cancer strategies that target cancer cells while sparing normal and immune cells.
In data that forms the premise of our application: (1) We identify a molecular mechanism by which the rate
limiting step of pyrimidine synthesis, catalyzed by the enzyme CAD, is allosterically regulated by UTP. We
engineer constitutively active CAD mutants to assess the importance of this regulatory activity. (2) We
determined that a p53-dependent ribosome biogenesis checkpoint (RBC) is triggered by pyrimidine
ribonucleotide insufficiency, a feature that we propose underlies a key metabolic difference between cancer and
normal cells. (3) We discovered two methods for perturbing pyrimidine metabolism that induce a 10-30 fold
increase in sensitivity to clinically relevant cytosine analogs. Our objective is to understand how perturbations
to pyrimidine sensing and the response to pyrimidine depletion impact cancer metabolism, anti-tumor immune
cell function, and the response to therapy. Our rationale is that disrupting CAD pyrimidine sensing will result in
pyrimidine overflow, and perturbation of the RBC will cause reversible cell cycle arrest, each of which will
differentially affect cancer and tumor immune cell metabolism and function. Our specific aims test the following
hypotheses: (1) Pyrimidine overflow will limit cancer cell function while promoting anti-cancer T cell activation,
(2) Uridine analogs modulate pyrimidine salvage pathway activity, promoting sensitivity to pyrimidine-based
chemotherapeutics, (3) Chronic pyrimidine synthesis inhibition induces a GEM-sensitive cancer cell state, (4)
The RBC restrains tumor immune cell function and limits p53-WT cancer cell toxicity, (5) Bypass of the RBC
potentiates the effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapeutics targeting pyrimidine biosynthesis. This
contribution is significant because pyrimidine metabolism is a major cancer target that impacts both cancer and
anti-tumor immune cell function, but whose efficient targeting needs improvement. This research is innovative
because (1) we utilize novel CAD hyperactive mutants based on our work identifying CAD allosteric regulation
mechanisms, (2) we use separation of function MDM2 mutants to interrogate the impact of the RBC on cancer
and immune cell function in culture and tumors, (3) we leverage our extensive experience in cellular metabolism
to understand the metabolic impact of the perturbed pyrimidine sensing and response pathways and pyrimidine-
based chemotherapeutics. Completion of these aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of pyrimidine
synthesis regulation and cell cycle control mechanisms that respond to nucleotide limitation. The information
gained will elucidate strategies to target cancer cells while sparing normal immune cell function, informing future
approaches to inhibit cancer intrinsic targets and promote anti-tumor immunity."
10978456,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and one of the most common
reasons patients are prescribed opioids, despite their poor ability to improve function. LBP threatens our
economic health due to high rates of health care utilization and disability, our security due to high rates of
medical discharge from armed services, and our quality of life due to pain-related suffering, pain-associ-
ated opioid misuse, depression, and anxiety. The primary driver in 40% of all LBP cases is estimated to
be pain resulting from intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, referred to as discogenic LBP. Improved
understanding of this degenerative process is needed to address this global problem. Epigenetic mecha-
nisms, such as DNA methylation, dynamically regulate gene expression in response to local, systemic
and environmental influences. However, very little is known about the role of DNA methylation in dis-
cogenic LBP. This application will address this knowledge gap by determining the role of DNA methyla-
tion in the pathological expression of genes involved in IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP.
Our central hypothesis is that widespread and persistent reprogramming of gene expression by DNA
methylation drives IVD degeneration and can be targeted for the treatment of discogenic LBP. Since
DNA methylation is potentially a mechanism underlying the chronicity of pain, elucidation of the role of
DNA methylation in IVD degeneration is likely to provide a strong scientific framework for innovative new
treatment approaches for discogenic LBP. In Aim 1 we will identify the DNA methylation and gene ex-
pression landscape of IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in humans. In Aim 2, we will identify the
DNA methylation and gene expression landscape of IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in animal
models and delineate correlated DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. In Aim 3, we will explore
the role of DNA methylation on IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in animal models by manipulating
methylation using non-pharmacological (home cage voluntary running wheels) and pharmacological in-
terventions.
These results will be significant because scientific evidence of a role for epigenetic reprogramming in IVD
degeneration and discogenic LBP may contribute to a paradigm shift in understanding, prevention, and
treatment of chronic LBP."
10978459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This grant application aims to develop the PediCODE Consortium and Biorepository and identify the
monogenic causes of Congenital Diarrhea and Enteropathy (CoDE). The CoDE disorders are rare monogenic
disorders that are under-researched and associated with enormous management costs and adverse life-long
outcomes. We will characterize these disorders' clinical and pathophysiological features and expand our
clinical database and biorepository of disease-specific cells, tissues, and other primary patient materials. We
anticipate that through these efforts, we will identify novel genes implicated in CoDE while we establish a
unique resource enabling mechanistic studies on both known and unknown causal CoDE genes. To achieve
these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of Physician-Scientists with an interest and
experience in cell biology and genetic disorders resulting in diarrhea.
The proposed research project aims to expand the clinical and sample repository that we have developed for
studying CoDE disorders. Our initial aim focuses on enrolling CoDE patients into a multi-center cohort and
capturing detailed clinical, genetic, and pathological data. Additionally, patient-derived samples will be
collected to develop protein-interactome and single-cell transcriptomic data. Computational and image data
tools will be developed to analyze these biopsies' enteroids and uncover features associated with each CoDE
disorder. We will then address clinical cases where a causative variant in a known CoDE gene is not identified.
A systematic pipeline, including whole exome and RNA sequencing, will be employed to identify and
functionally validate unknown cases. Novel intestinal epithelial assays and patient-derived enteroids will
provide a cellular phenotype of these disorders and be selectively supported with animal models. Finally, we
will explore various options to examine therapeutic discovery for known CoDE disorders. We have developed
quantitative assays of epithelial function in patient-derived enteroids, and animal models have been developed
and validated. These assays will be adapted and extended for high-throughput applications in therapy
development. Targeted screening for potential therapeutic modalities will be conducted, and pre-clinical
validation will be performed using CoDE mouse and zebrafish models. The aim is to explore novel treatment
principles in multiple models for clinical translation. The research project aims to expand the understanding of
CoDE disorders, develop new tools and resources, identify and functionally study novel cases, and enable
therapeutic discovery of known CoDE disorders. We anticipate that the PediCoDE Consortium and
Biorepository will be a rich resource for patients, their families, clinicians, and scientific researchers. We
anticipate that these efforts will expand our understanding of CoDE disorders and identify novel approaches for
improving the clinical symptoms of affected children."
10984273,"Complex glycoconjugates play a pivotal role in bacterial survival, colonization, and virulence, and
contribute to the interactions between symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria and their human hosts. Assembly
of these macromolecules is initiated on the cytoplasmic face of cell membranes, catalyzed by polyprenol
phosphate (PrenP) phosphoglycosyl transferases (PGTs). PGTs transfer a C1’-phosphosugar from a
soluble nucleoside diphosphate-sugar to a PrenP acceptor, yielding a membrane-bound polyprenol
diphosphosugar. Our studies focus on the exclusively prokaryotic PGT superfamily with a monotopic
membrane topology (monoPGTs). Our work has previously led to the mechanistic and structural
characterization of the monoPGTs, revealing a unique reentrant membrane helix supporting the structure
of the active-site residues and substrate-binding determinants. Identification of this core fold has enabled
bioinformatic analysis of sequences from diverse bacteria where the gene encoding the PGT enables
identification of the “signature step” in a dedicated set of genes that, together, describe the glycan of the
glycoconjugate product. The proposed studies will investigate the structures and binding landscapes of
the monoPGT superfamily, and the design of biological probes will establish the fundamental knowledge
and tools needed for validating and intervening in the action of potential therapeutic targets. In Aim 1,
sequence similarity networks will guide the choice of candidates for X-ray crystallographic analysis that
will be determined with detergent-solubilized protein in the small (Sm) monoPGTs, which encodes the core
fold without elaboration. Substrate and inhibitor-liganded structures and activity analysis will elucidate the
determinants of substrate specificity. Genome neighborhood networks will inform on the presence of genes
in the operon that catalyze the biosynthesis of unusual sugars to be tested as substrates. Aim 2 will address
the pathway regulation and flux assisted by the determination of X-ray and CryoEM structures. Protein-
protein interactions will be analyzed via covariance analysis and elucidation of the structure of bifunctional
(Bi) monoPGTs, fusions of monoPGTs and glycosyltransferases, which will also define membrane
interactions and electrostatics. The binding of nucleotides to the proposed regulatory domain of unknown
function (DUF) present in the large (Lg) monoPGTs and dehydrogenases in the pathway will be tested.
Aim 3 builds on nucleoside analogs from solid-phase synthesis and non-hydrolyzable uridine
bisphosphonate-sugars (UBPs) as probes and inhibitors for the prokaryotic monoPGT superfamily. The
structure of UBPs bound to monoPGT targets in Aim 1 will inform further design and identification of
specificity determinants. Overall, these comprehensive and in-depth studies will provide a detailed
structural and functional understanding of this untapped bacterial enzyme superfamily and knowledge of
their glycoconjugate pathways and cellular function."

The emergency department (ED) has emerged as a critical context from which to address the U.S. opioid
overdose crisis, which in 2021 alone accounted for over 80,000 deaths. This K02 Independent Scientist Award
will enhance my research career with implementation science approaches to address multiple domains of the
HHS Overdose Prevention Strategy from the emergency care setting. During this K02 award, I will augment my
existing clinical expertise in emergency medicine and addiction medicine and current research portfolio
spanning the continuum of opioid use and opioid use disorder with (1) new skills, knowledge, and training in
implementation science, (2) advanced proficiency in clinical trial design, and (3) specialized professional
development in team leadership and management. To accomplish these training objectives, I will leverage my
ongoing R01-funded single site randomized trial evaluating an embedded ED physical therapy intervention as
a non-opioid treatment modality for low back pain (R01HS027426, NCT04921449), which affects nearly 2 in 5
people and is the most common reason for acute and chronic opioid use. Specifically, I will (1) evaluate
implementation outcomes across multiple partners engaged in my ongoing R01 trial, (2) gather qualitative data
on contextual implementation determinants and preferred implementation strategies among current and future
research partners for use in a future multi-site hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, and (3) conduct a
mixed-methods cost analysis of the embedded ED physical therapy care model to facilitate its scalability and
long-term sustainability. This K02 award comes at an opportune time in my early- to mid-career transition, as it
will provide me with a four-year period of intensive research focus to conduct these training and research
activities, which I could not otherwise accomplish given my current clinical obligations as an emergency
medicine physician. Following completion of this K02 award, I will apply the newly acquired implementation
science expertise to accelerate and catalyze the translation of my research agenda to real-world practice,
including primary prevention, harm reduction, and evidence-based interventions for opioid use disorder from
the ED setting."
10987256,"This Diversity Supplement to the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) study will examine the influence of experiencing discrimination on mental health during the peripartum period and determine the potential transgenerational influence of discrimination by examining offspring neurobehavioral development. We will focus on infant amygdala volume at 1 month of age and infant negative affect at 3-9 months of age as these offspring outcomes are early emerging transdiagnostic indicators of risk for mental health problems, and have previously
demonstrated vulnerability to prenatal exposures. Prior research in animal models and in developmental work in humans has demonstrated the sensitivity of the fetal amygdala to stress in the prenatal environment due to stress sensitive biological systems, which also play critical roles in brain development. These early alterations in amygdala development have further been shown to predict increases in negative affect evident in early infancy and lower regulatory capacity as children get older. This proposal will test the extent to which discrimination represents an important contributing factor to these previously observed neurobehavioral phenotypes involving
early alterations in the amygdala and heightened negative affect. With regard to the training aspect, this supplement provides a unique opportunity for the applicant to develop professional relationships with a network of national and international scientific and policy leader within her area of focus. The applicant will receive mentorship not only from the lead HBCD investigators at her institution, but also from senior investigators and leaders in the HBCD consortium at two other institutions across the country. She will participate in consortium wide activities, such as the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Work Group, to allow her to take full advantage of the collective expertise and career development opportunities afforded by the HBCD consortium. She will also gain training in the methods central to this application and her scientific career goals, including characterizing infant behavior (administration and coding of behavioral tasks) and early brain development (acquisition and basic processing of magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] data). It further includes study of key theoretical and methodological aspects of research focused on prenatal programming, including assessment of perinatal mental health symptoms and social determinants of health with an emphasis on discrimination. These trainings will be supplemented by training in foundational statistics, skills for conducting research with high-risk populations, and
scientific writing (both for manuscripts and grants). These training experiences will position the applicant for her long-term career goal to conduct research investigating the mechanisms by which social-emotional adversity transmits intergenerationally, and influences child behavior, affect and development. This supplement will not only provide training that the applicant would not normally receive, but will also provide important information about the potential long-lasting transgenerational influence of discrimination and relevant risk and protective factors to inform public policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."
10988044,"PROJECT SUMMARY [parent project]
The objective of the proposed research is to engineer a targeted biological nanoparticle platform with high
intracranial delivery and glial cell targeting for broad applicability in drug delivery and imaging. A great deal of
work has already been accomplished elucidating the ability of certain extracellular vesicles (EVs) to cross
endothelial barriers, especially the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Other work has established that EVs exhibit
excellent tropism towards particular tissues and cell types. The focus of this proposal is to understand the
mechanisms by which certain EV subpopulations accomplish these feats, and to engineer them into a hybrid
liposome-EV drug delivery platform. Given the plethora of recent research into EV structure and function, it is
well known that they exhibit considerable compositional heterogeneity. But fundamental questions still exist as
to how EV prescribed functions differ across these subpopulations. It is likely that off-target effects and
inefficiencies in capturing native EV functions with engineered mimetics are due to their substantial
heterogeneity. Our first hypothesis is that homogenization of EVs towards a narrow size range with uniform
biomolecular content will result in a more potent and controllable drug delivery platform that maintains native EV
function yet reduces off-target toxicity. Our second hypothesis is that fusion of homogenized EVs and
liposomes with various functions (i.e., efficient BBB permeation through receptor mediated transcytosis) will
deliver an engineered product combining desired functions. We plan on addressing these hypotheses through
rigorous engineering to homogenize EVs (Aim 1) alongside biochemical assays to detangle the mechanisms
important for EV intracranial delivery. We will utilize EVs isolated from gliatropic “experts”, namely a vast library
of glioblastoma (GBM) patient derived primary cell lines, brain-metastasizing breast cancer cells, and other glial
and neuronal cells like astrocytes and neurons. Key molecular players important for intracranial delivery identified
from those studies will feedback into synthesis of engineered EVs (eEVs) via subsequent fusion with carrier EVs
(Aim 2). For the engineered eEV product, we will also incorporate synthetic liposomes decorated with known
ligands to trigger receptor mediated transcytosis through the BBB endothelial layer. To provide the greatest
opportunity to measure efficiency of functional intracranial delivery, we plan to load formulated, labeled, and
homogenized eEVs with a chemotherapeutic payload and determine drug-release profile, biodistribution, and
efficacy in healthy mice with intact BBBs and then an orthotopic GBM model (Aim 3). The proposed work is
important because it seeks to eliminate the highly confounding factor of particle-to-particle variability plaguing
effective application of EVs as potent drug-delivery vehicles. Success in homogenizing eEVs will result in an
increased understanding of their biological function and assist in their application to combat a wide variety of
neurological disorders where current drug delivery approaches are thwarted by low intracranial delivery."

This K99/R00 application aims to provide support for Dr. Felix Poppelaars, a talented postdoctoral fellow in the
laboratory of Dr. Joshua Thurman, to conduct further research and training that will allow him to successfully
transition into an independent investigator in the field of kidney immunology. As part of the K99 training plan, he
will expand his knowledge and skills in molecular imaging of complement activation needed to establish himself
as a leader in translational research of complement biology in nephrology. Furthermore, he will enhance his
intellectual and professional skills, gain valuable mentorship, and participate in various career development
activities, that will fast-track him to reach scientific independence. Guided by strong preliminary data, his
proposed research project aims to develop an innovative medical tool for the visualization and quantification of
complement deposition in the kidney, using antibody-based positron emission tomography (Immuno-PET)
imaging. Activation of the complement system results in the deposition of smaller fragments on tissue.
Complement deposition is often present in the renal biopsy of patients with kidney disease, making it an attractive
target-of-interest for molecular imaging. Dr. Poppelaars will first (Aim 1A) uncover the molecular footprint
associated with complement deposition in kidney disease using a multi-omics approach in mice. With training
from leading experts, he will then (Aim 2A) examine the application of PET imaging of complement deposition in
mice with kidney disease for disease staging and prognostication. After transitioning to a faculty position, Dr.
Poppelaars will (Aim 1B) characterize the in vivo kinetics of complement deposition during kidney disease,
followed by (Aim 2B) longitudinal studies of PET imaging of complement deposition in mice with kidney disease
to monitor treatment responses. Finally, he will (Aim 3) translate his findings to humans by establishing the
feasibility of ex-vivo PET imaging of complement deposition in discarded donor kidneys. Overall, the proposed
research has the potential to improve the care and outcomes of patients with kidney disease, by 1.) enabling
longitudinal noninvasive evaluation, 2.) tailoring treatment plans, and 3.) advancing our mechanistic
understanding of the pathophysiology of kidney disease. In addition, the proposed research will open exciting
avenues for future fundable research in the field of kidney transplantation. The primary mentor, Dr. Thurman,
and co-mentor, Dr. Michael Holers, are internationally recognized and NIH-funded scientists with a strong history
of successful mentoring in translational immunological research. With their guidance and the support of the
advisory team members Dr. Jason Lewis, Dr. Laura Barisoni, and Carl Atkinson, as well as collaborators, Dr.
Poppelaars will be able to successfully complete the proposed research and training plan and transition to an
independent, extramurally funded tenure-track position at a top-tier research institution."

About 1 in 4 Americans who use insulin report rationing their insulin to save money. Emerging adults living with
type 1 diabetes (T1D) have worse glycemic outcomes than other age groups. During this developmental stage,
young people are compelled to navigate healthcare and insurance for the first time independently, while also
experiencing the highest rates of poverty and unemployment among adults. Notably, researchers in the cancer
literature have begun to describe this objective financial burden and subjective financial distress of healthcare
costs, collectively named financial toxicity. In the last 10 years, financial toxicity has been described,
measured, and targeted as the focus of interventions in cancer research. It is timely to elucidate how emerging
adults with T1D experience these financial and healthcare burdens, mirroring the understanding of financial
toxicity in the cancer literature into diabetes research.
Katherine Wentzell, PhD, PNP, BC-ADM is a pediatric nurse practitioner and early-career clinical researcher
who will target this understudied area in T1D in her K23 proposal focused on emerging adults. In her recent
doctoral and postdoctoral work, she developed a new measure of diabetes distress in emerging adults, which
included an item about the worry about diabetes costs and this item was the most highly endorsed on the
survey. This preliminary work underscored her interest in investigating the impact of financial stressors in
emerging adults with T1D, especially those with suboptimal glycemic control. She has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team led by national experts in diabetes clinical and behavioral research, as well
as advisors with focused methodological and cost-related expertise.
This K23 career development proposal includes 3 specific aims incorporating mixed-methods research and
culminating in a pilot randomized controlled trial. In Aim 1a, Dr. Wentzell will use semi-structured interviews to
describe the experience of financial toxicity, health insurance access, and cost-coping behaviors in a diverse
sample of emerging adults. In Aim 1b, she will utilize the innovative methodology of asynchronous online text-
based focus groups to expand the understanding of cost related non-adherence and financial toxicity in
emerging adults with T1D. In Aim 2, Dr. Wentzell will develop and validate a new measure of financial toxicity
and explore relationships among social determinants of health, health insurance access, and psychological
factors as they relate to objective financial burden, subjective financial distress, and glycemic outcomes in a
diverse nationwide sample of emerging adults with T1D. Finally, building on the results in the prior aims, in Aim
3, she will develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot psychoeducational intervention to reduce subjective
financial distress and cost related non-adherence in emerging adults with suboptimal glycemic control.
Through the proposed career development award, Dr. Wentzell will acquire important skills in mixed-methods
and intervention research to reach her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator."

The proposed project will leverage 16 twin samples from the Interplay of Genes and Environments across
Studies (IGEMS) Consortium, and incorporate four additional samples, to clarify which modifiable risk factors
may be most influential in increasing risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and at
which developmental stages their risks are greatest. The overarching goal of this project is to apply twin
models to strengthen or refute causal hypotheses and test gene-environment interplay among modifiable
factors for AD/ADRD, considering risk and resilience profiles within and across developmental periods of the
lifespan. Given the aging of the populations worldwide, AD/ADRD are expected to show substantial increases
over the next few decades, making the proposed study especially timely. We focus on modifiable risk factors in
the hope that clarifying the mechanisms and timing of their effects may help to guide prevention and
intervention to reduce AD/ADRD. Many of our genetically- and environmentally-informed samples include
longitudinal data and polygenic scores (PGS). Drawing from samples in Sweden, Denmark, Australia, and the
United States, we will (a) create multi-dimensional risk scores for early life contexts and (b) evaluate PGSs for
neurodevelopmental disorders and educational attainment in addition to PGSs for Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
AD resilience, and modifiable factors. We will leverage within-between models of twins and siblings of
exposures and genetic risk to test causal hypotheses that control for confounding, and explore gene-
environment (GE) interplay of modifiable risk factors for AD/ADRD and qualities of resilience to address our
aims: (SA1) evaluate mid- and late life physical health and health behavior factors that alter AD/ADRD risk;
(SA2) evaluate midlife and late life socioemotional factors that alter AD/ADRD risk; and (SA3) examine how
early life risks work together with midlife and late life health and socioemotional factors to influence AD/ADRD
risk while also incorporating GE interplay. The proposed research study will extend the life course model of
AD/ADRD by implementing a systems-level approach, guided by the NIH disparities framework, to investigate
key environmental factors that contribute to social inequities, including multiple early life adversities and risk
factors and measuring them at different times. Indeed, we will evaluate how mid- and late life risk act in
combination with early life risks and genetics to create differential profiles of AD/ADRD risk across sex,
cohorts, and countries. Our novel approach of leveraging both twin and genomic data will provide converging
evidence to inform clinical and policy recommendations with regard to the genetic interplay among risk and
protective factors that create differential vulnerabilities for AD/ADRD. The IGEMS Consortium is uniquely
positioned to advance the study aims using powerful approaches, rich phenotypes, high variability across
exposures and socioeconomically diverse samples, and lifespan coverage."

The processes by which people with cerebral palsy (CP) adapt and learn new movement patterns are poorly
understood. The Parent R01 for this NINDS Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related
Research seeks to quantify and understand motor adaptation in CP. Specifically, how individual differences in
adaptation influence responses to rehabilitation that aims to improve walking function. Multimodal feedback
training is a promising approach to support adaptation and motor learning, but few studies have evaluated
adaptation with real-time feedback training during walking or its impacts on walking function. The Parent R01
seeks to fill these gaps by completing the systematic experimental analyses necessary to quantify walking
adaption rates (Aim-1) and determine whether repeated exposure to multimodal feedback training can alter
adaptation rates (Aim-2) to induce motor learning and improve walking function (Aim-3). We provide
multimodal feedback using (1) sensorimotor feedback from adaptive ankle resistance delivered via a light-
weight, wearable robot and (2) audiovisual feedback of plantar flexor activity from EMG recordings. To
complement and extend this work, this Research Supplement will evaluate novel computational approaches
bridging machine learning and causal modeling to evaluate individual responses to feedback training. The
trainee will develop expertise bridging engineering, data science, and rehabilitation to (Supplement Aim-1)
develop individual models of response to feedback training that can be used to track progression within and
across sessions and (Supplement Aim-2) expand access to biomechanical monitoring and feedback training
outside of research laboratories. Supplement Aim-1 uses Bayesian Additive Regression Trees to leverage the
step-by-step data captured during the Parent R01 12 sessions of treadmill training to quantify changes in gait.
Supplement Aim-2 tests the accuracy of Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks to reconstruct key
biomechanical variables from a sparse set of wearable sensors. This research will be complemented by
extensive training in data science, rehabilitation, and biomechanics by a multidisciplinary team of mentors to
support the trainee's future goals to pursue a tenure-track faculty position in engineering. Together, this
research will introduce new methods to understand and optimize rehabilitation to individual needs and
priorities."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Most cellular functions are carried out by multisubunit protein complexes. Transcribe and translate as much as
you want, but odds are if your protein doesn't assemble properly with other proteins, the gene might as well be
off. As the final step in expression of most genes, protein complex assembly is hugely understudied, and it has
only recently become clear that the textbook model of diffusion-limited collisions between individual molecules
is inadequate. Septin proteins are found as cytoskeletal filaments in many eukaryotic cells and participate in a
wide variety of cellular functions. The building blocks of septin filaments are rod-shaped septin complexes
composed of distinct septin subunits. Multiple septins “compete” to occupy the same position in, and confer
specialized properties to, septin complexes, but it is not fully understood how specific subunits are “chosen” to
assemble the functionally appropriate complexes. How individual septins occupy specific positions within
complexes is one of the oldest questions in septin biology. Disease-causing septin mutations highlight the
importance of answering this question. Our lab is among the leaders in this field and in the next five years we
want to use the powerful tools we have developed in budding yeast to address specific knowledge gaps. For
other cytoskeletal proteins, achieving the conformation competent for complex assembly requires help from
molecular chaperones. How does chaperone-assisted de novo septin folding fit into the pathway of septin
complex assembly? Our recent work established the step-wise pathway of septin hetero-octamer assembly, and
identified septin-interacting chaperones that engage a septin-septin interaction interface and are necessary for
efficient septin folding. We will use a combination of genetics, cell biology and biochemistry to determine how
chaperone action sets the stage for septin-septin encounters during complex assembly. Recent studies show
that assembly of many complexes occurs co-translationally, and we find chaperone requirements for efficient
septin translation. To what extent is septin complex assembly co-translational? We will investigate septin-
chaperone and septin-septin interactions in the context of active translation. We previously identified key
residues in septin-septin interaction interfaces that mediate “partner recognition” during assembly and dictate
the subunit composition within complexes. An enduring mystery is how the two subunits at the “ends” of yeast
septin hetero-octamers always match. How do allosteric conformational changes across septin-septin interaction
interfaces direct the specificity of septin complex subunit composition? We will determine the mechanistic basis
of this phenomenon and determine the phenotypic consequences of inappropriate “mixing” of septin subunits
within complexes. Finally, it is not known how, once made, a septin complex is remodeled to incorporate new
subunits during cellular differentiation. We will determine the molecular mechanism by which yeast septin
complexes are remodeling during gametogenesis. These studies will provide valuable insights into how cells
assemble and modify septin complexes, with broader implications for multisubunit assembly in general."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts millions of Americans each year and can lead to cognitive dysfunction,
difficulty with sensory processing, sleep disruption, and the development of epilepsy. One common neural
outcome of TBI is the development of electrophysiological abnormalities that can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy
(PTE) or disruptions in sleep architecture. However, the mechanisms by which these neurological deficits arise
as a consequence of TBI remain poorly understood.
Preliminary evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to the electrophysiological abnormalities that
underlie PTE and sleep disruption in a mouse model of moderate TBI. Indeed, TBI is characterized by both the
activation of glial cells like astrocytes and microglia and by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells like
monocyte-derived macrophages and T cells. While neuroinflammation occurs immediately in the cortical region
of acute injury, secondary neuroinflammation develops slowly in the ipsilateral thalamus, presumably as a result
of loss of intimate reciprocal connections between cortex and thalamus. Because the cortico-thalamo-cortical
(CTC) circuit plays a key role in cognition, sleep, and seizures, which are all impacted by TBI, the delayed neural
plasticity in this circuit is a good model for teasing apart the interaction between the immune cells and neural
circuits after TBI.
The role of peripheral immune cells is particularly understudied in the context of TBI-derived electrophysiological
deficits like PTE and sleep disruption. Here we use a controlled-cortical impact mouse model of moderate TBI
to determine the role of delayed infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and T cells in secondary
neuronal loss (Aim 1), excitation/inhibition imbalance in the cortico-thalamic circuit (Aim 2), and the development
of electrographic abnormalities such as sleep disruption and PTE (Aim 3). To do so, we combine cutting-edge
tools from both neuroscience and immunology, including genetic manipulations, flow cytometry, 3D imaging of
immune-neural interactions, synaptic physiology in brain slices, and chronic wireless EEG recordings.
The goal of the project is to understand how the immune system interacts with neural circuits after TBI to cause
the development of neurological deficits. Given that there are treatments already available in clinic to block
subsets of T cells and macrophages, this study has the potential to rapidly impact how TBI is treated in human
patients."

 Fibrosis, defined by the deposition of collagen I, is a devastating pathological event that occurs in many
organs including the heart, kidney, liver and lung in response to injury and inflammation. This fibrotic response
inhibits recovery inflammation and can even lead to organ failure. Despite the potential importance, very little is
known about whether there is a fibrotic response in the central nervous system (CNS) following
neuroinflammation that occurs in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, stroke and CNS
infections, and how this response affects repair and recovery. Using experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of neuroinflammation, we have identified that a robust collagen I-
based fibrotic scar forms covering the neuroinflammatory lesion and we hypothesize that this fibrotic scar
inhibits the ability of reparative cells to enter the lesion. In preliminary studies using lineage tracing and single
cell sequencing, we have identified that this fibrotic scar is formed by the activation and proliferation of
fibroblasts. We have further generated methods to isolate and culture CNS fibroblasts providing an in vitro
model to study the proliferation, migration and collagen 1 production from these cells. In this proposal we aim
to determine whether the fibrotic scar is helpful or harmful for recovery following neuroinflammation and to
further study the mechanisms that regulate fibrotic scar formation. We will first determine whether inhibition of
fibrotic scar formation can lead to an increased recovery from EAE. We will then examine whether TGFβ and
PDGFR signaling pathways regulate fibrotic scar formation. We hypothesize that TGFβ signaling drives the
proliferation and collagen I production by the fibroblasts and that PDGFR signaling regulates the migration of
the fibroblasts to the lesion. Our goal is to determine whether modulating the fibrotic scar is a potential
therapeutic target to aid in recovery for patients with neuroinflammatory diseases."

treatment for the entire population depends on engaging and educating individuals from underrepresented and
diverse backgrounds. This need is especially applicable to Alabama and the surrounding region, where a large
proportion of the population experiences health care disparities, where there is a large African American
population, and where many students—from both advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds—pursue
undergraduate education in the state university system or in Historically Black Colleges or Universities
(HBCUs) in the region. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is committed to furthering the national
goal of increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce and is ideally positioned to do so in the field of
genomic medicine. UAB ranks among the top 5% of U.S. universities based on all federal research and
development expenditures and in the top 1% of all public, private, and international organizations funded by
the National Institutes of Health. UAB is internationally recognized for its diversity and education programs.
UAB has an outstanding record of successful training for undergraduate, graduate, and other professional
school students from diverse backgrounds and has established several programs to aid undergraduate and
post-baccalaureate (postbacc) students from underserved groups who aspire to doctoral and other
professional careers (e.g., UAB PREP Scholars Program). This R25 renewal proposes to leverage and build
on the environment and expertise at UAB to develop the Summer Undergraduate and Postbacc Experiences in
Research in Genomic Medicine (SUPER-GM), built off of the foundation from our prior Summer Undergraduate
Research Experiences in Genomic Medicine (SURE-GM) program. The current SURE-GM program has had
46 scholars from nine HBCUs successfully participate. SUPER-GM is SURE-GM reimagined as a summer
program with a year-long possible postbacc extension tailored for HBCU undergraduate students that will
provide more scholars with the necessary skills, exposure, and experiences to succeed in graduate and/or
professional training in genomic medicine. To do so, we propose to expand the SUPER-GM summer research
and professional development experience for rising undergraduate seniors (Aim 1), establish a SUPER-GM
postbacc research and professional development experience for selected individuals who have completed the
SUPER-GM summer experience and graduated with a STEM degree (Aim 2), and grow the SUPER-GM
recruitment and engagement program with our HBCU partners (Aim 3). Implementation of these Aims, coupled
with the robust assessment and review process we established during SURE-GM, will lead to greater
participation of underrepresented students in the biomedical workforce, a greater diversity of scientists and
physician-scientists engaged in biomedical research, and a greater appreciation of the roles and potential of
genomic medicine in science and society."

Southeast Asian and immigrant Chinese communities across the globe have disproportionately high NPC
incidence, averaging 25-30 times higher than the general population in neighboring areas. EBV infection is
extremely common and more than 95% of adults have seroconverted, but only a subset of chronic carriers will
develop EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Latent and clonal EBV infection occurs in the tumor
cells, and a variant of a key EBV protein (EBNA1 Val487) required for co-infection with the host has been
identified as a cancer risk-variant because it is found in nearly all (98.8%) NPC tumors from NPC-endemic areas.
Both EBV serology and EBV DNA sequencing are informative. Early detection screening programs by one of
two screening methods (IgA serology, or next-gen sequencing of plasma cell-free EBV DNA) have been
recommended for NPC-endemic populations. However, the screening time-interval for routine early detection is
not known. A biomarker that can identify high-risk individuals several years before clinical onset would greatly
benefit from an early detection screening program.
Antibodies to EBV proteins rise several years before NPC onset. IgA serology is a sentinel for aberrant EBV
infection at mucosal sites. We previously surveyed EBV IgA/IgG/IgM serology from the serum of incident NPC
cases in a Singapore prospective cohort (discovery cohort) and tested the leading biomarker (EBNA1 IgA) in an
additional validation cohort from Shanghai, China. The sojourn time for the custom EBNA1 IgA assay was 4
years before NPC diagnosis (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity in 20 case-controls). False-positives emerged
in the expanded control samples which is likely attributed to periodic EBV reactivation but background signal
could be minimized by removing cross-reactive epitopes yielding a satisfactory EBNA1 IgA assay (93.7%
specificity at 100% sensitivity). Following on from the case-control study performed on a low-throughput but
highly accurate multiplex immunoblot assay, the goal of this proposal is to develop a high-throughput EBNA1
IgA assay using a prototypic slot blot assay and applying the principles from EBNA1 mapping studies. By
leveraging EBV serology, this work is expected to produce a high-throughput assay for NPC risk assessment.
Identified high-risk individuals would benefit from an NPC early detection screening program and/or clinical
follow-up."

Emergency department clinicians (ECs) regularly experience among the highest rates of psychological
distress. Manifesting in poor well-being and burnout, EC psychological distress can lead to adverse outcomes
for patient care, institutions (e.g., costly attrition), and individual ECs (e.g., illness and death). On-going
surveys conducted by the research team since 2020 have collected validated measures of an EC well-being
index and burnout score for three types of ECs (attendings, Advanced Practice Clinicians, and residents) at
seven emergency department locations at a large academic health system in upstate South Carolina.
Locations span urban to rural settings. Our interdisciplinary team proposes to link key contextual factors of
institutional stressors (including staffing strain and patient congestion) with coincident contextual factors
(including external pandemic status and individual demographic characteristics) to measure and visualize well-
being and burnout. Aim 1 will quantify the relationships between stressors and context with well-being and
burnout. Generalized linear mixed effects models will consider contributors of each predictor on both
outcomes, and factor analysis will compare the relative contribution of each predictor. Machine learning
methods will be used to develop a predictive model to evaluate future burnout risk. In Aim 2, we will develop a
visualization framework to display predictors and corresponding real-time predictions of well-being. Iterative
refinement will improve the visualization channels, user performance, and support accessibility. Mixed-method
validation with EC leadership will involve interviews to probe interpretation of data insights with the graphical
framework and eye-tracking to evaluate performance and speed. Consistent with the exploratory nature of an
R21, the visualization will be developed with EC-informed hypothetical values. A follow-on study will be
proposed to integrate the work both aims and to implement and evaluate the use of the visualization to improve
interpretation in practice. We anticipate that this research will both spur further work to develop decision-
support tools to address modifiable factors to improve well-being and have immediate impact in understanding
contributors to EC well-being and burnout. This work seeks to improve EC experience to interrupt the negative
feedback loop that drives adverse outcomes in patient care, EC turnover, and institutional goals to ultimately
improve EC well-being and patient care."

Mitochondrial dysfunction in post-menopausal women due to loss of estradiol (E2) alone or in combination with
age-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a central role in development of
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Impaired oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) and increased ROS production are linked to dysfunctional hepatic lipid metabolism and liver
steatosis. Despite the impact of age and E2 loss on mitochondrial function in post-menopausal women, there is
a lack of targeted therapies to treat menopause-associated hepatocellular mitochondrial dysfunction. Current
therapies for menopause, which include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs), have adverse and off-target effects such as increased risk for gynecologic cancer and
deep vein thrombosis and stroke. Moreover, none of these treatments specifically target mitochondrial function.
New pharmaceuticals targeting hepatocellular mitochondrial function with or without E2 would reduce morbidity
due to metabolic disease and improve the quality of life for post-menopausal women. The long-term goal of
this research is to develop effective therapies to treat mitochondrial dysfunction in post-menopausal women.
The objective of this proposal is to determine if two distinct, targeted nanoparticles can improve mitochondrial
function in HepG2 cells cultured in MASLD-like conditions and in aged and E2-deficient female mice. The
central hypothesis is that two unique nanoparticles – one that works via the nucleus and one that works directly
at the mitochondria via E2 - can be delivered to improve mitochondrial function in aged and E2-deficient
hepatocytes whose function is impacted by MASLD. Co-Investigator Dr. Gaharwar has developed a new class
of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers that scavenge ROS, increase transcription factor a mitochondria
(TFAM) protein and mitochondrial biogenesis, and yield increased OXPHOS/ATP production. Based on
preliminary data using poly(lactic-coglycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-triphenylphosphine (PGLA-PEG-TPP)
nanoparticles covalently bonded to E2 (mito-E2) which demonstrates that mito-E2 colocalizes with
mitochondrial (mt) estrogen receptor (ER) beta (β), it is predicted that mito-E2 will target mtERβ and mtER
alpha (a) to improve 𝛽 oxidation and ATP production and decrease ROS. The hypothesis will be tested with
two Aims: (1) Determine if MoS2 nanoflower and mito-E2 improve mitochondrial function in aged and E2-
deficient MASLD-like conditions; (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms of mito-E2 at mtERa and mtER𝛽 in
HepG2 cells cultured in MASLD-like conditions. It is expected that each of the nanoparticles will improve
mitochondrial function in MASLD-like HepG2 cells and in mouse menopause models through different but
complimentary mechanisms. This innovative proposal lays the foundation to develop nanoparticle therapeutics
to treat post-menopausal MASLD. Specifically targeting mitochondria will advance precision medicine and
improve quality of life in individuals suffering from age-related liver disease."
10990338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a deadly cardiopulmonary disease that develops following a genetic or
environmental insult, is characterized by pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction and occlusive vascular
remodeling. The loss or mutation of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type 2 (BMPR2) function, which
regulates the growth and differentiation of pulmonary vascular cells, plays an important role in PAH.
Switch-Independent 3a (SIN3a) is a master transcriptional scaffold that plays an essential role in regulating gene
transcription and maintaining chromatin structure, and its absence or inappropriate recruitment has been
associated with aberrant gene silencing. We have recently shown that SIN3a plays a central role in the
hypermethylation of the BMPR2 promoter in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the pathogenesis of PAH.
Interestingly, BMPR2 is highly expressed in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) and is vital to their
function and survival. The molecular mechanisms of SIN3a epigenetic regulation underlying BMPR2 gene
alteration in PAH-PAEC are not fully elucidated, thus, identifying the mechanism(s) that restore SIN3a
expression/function in PAECs in the setting of PAH will offer new therapeutic opportunities. Our objectives in this
proposal are to elucidate the role and the downstream mechanisms of SIN3a on the regulation of BMPR2 and
EC dysfunction in PAH and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of targeting PAECs using lipoprotein nanoparticles
encapsulating modified RNA encoding SIN3a (SIN3a.modRNA-LNP) and AAV6.hSIN3a gene therapy. While
investigating how SIN3a regulates BMPR2 in PAECs, we discovered a novel molecular pathway by which SIN3a
overexpression inhibits the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and reverses FOXK2 promoter region histone
methylation and restores FOXK2 and consequently upregulates BMPR2 by increasing FOXK2 binding to the
BMPR2 promoter. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that SIN3a plays a critical role in PAEC
homeostasis; mechanistically, disrupting SIN3a expression contributes to FOXK2 promoter histone
modifications and thus to BMPR2 dysregulation and EC dysfunction, resulting in PAH. In this proposal,
the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim1) To define the role of SIN3a and the
epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the BMPR2 gene and PAH-PAEC dysfunction. Aim 2) To characterize
SIN3a/FOXK2 interplay in BMPR2 regulation in the setting of PAH in human lung tissues and SIN3a KO mice.
Aim 3) To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeted SIN3a gene transfer to lung endothelial cells in small
animal models of PAH. The proposed study presents the novel concept that modulation of SIN3a is essential for
endothelium function in PAH disease and applies a systematic approach to integrate sophisticated functional
validation assays, modified mRNA, and AAV6 gene therapy. Significantly, the proposed research is expected to
vertically advance and expand our understanding of epigenetic regulation in pulmonary endothelial cells in PAH.
Such knowledge is critical for the development of PAH therapies targeting epigenetic aberrations."

There is significant evidence of cancer-type specific patterns of sex hormone receptor expression and signaling
in many central nervous system (CNS) tumors, often correlating with their high sex-specificity. This supports the
hypothesis that sex hormone receptors play tumorigenic and pathologic roles across many CNS cancers.
However, their mechanistic functions in CNS tumors remain largely unknown. This proposal seeks to address
these knowledge gaps in 2 of these cancers: meningioma and glioblastoma (GBM). In Aim 1, I explore the
mechanism underlying progesterone receptor (PR) expression and signaling in meningiomas, the most common
primary intracranial tumors. Meningiomas are 2.7 times more common in females than in males, can arise in the
setting of exogenous female hormone therapy, and 70% express high levels PR, suggesting female sex
hormones may drive meningioma tumorigenesis. Using human meningioma xenografts in mice treated with
clinically relevant doses of synthetic progestins, I developed a model of female sex hormone-driven meningioma.
The data presented in this application suggest progestins induce PR expression, increase tumor growth, and
reduce survival through a positive feedback mechanism that requires progesterone membrane component 1
(PGRMC1), a non-classical hormone receptor with pathologic roles in breast and endometrial cancers. The
central hypothesis of my doctoral dissertation project is that progestin ligand activates PGRMC1 to drive
expression of PR in meningioma through regulation of NFB transcriptional activity, and that PR drives
meningioma growth through cytoplasmic activation of MAPK signaling and transcriptional activation of TNFSF11,
TGFA, and IRS2. Through the remainder of my graduate work I will (i) validate the pathway through which
PGRMC1 drives PR expression through ChIP-QPCR, luciferase reporter, and loss-of-function validation models,
(ii) identify hormonal cofactors involved in PGRMC1 signaling, (iii) validate the roles of PR downstream targets
in driving growth and proliferation in meningioma through gain- and loss-of-function models, and (iv) incorporate
human proteomic data to define expression levels of proteins implicated in PR and PGRMC1 signaling pathways
in human patients. In Aim 2, I outline the proposed direction of my postdoctoral studies, the characterization of
sex hormone signaling pathways in GBM. The most malignant primary brain tumors in adults, GBM are often
marked by high expression of androgen and estrogen receptors, yet limited and often contradictory functional
data for these receptors in GBM has impeded the development of sex hormone-targeted therapeutics. For this
project, I plan to (i) perform integrated proteomic and phospho-proteomic characterization of hormone signaling
networks in GBM, (ii) characterize and mechanistically validate the pathways through which sex hormone
signaling influences GBM pathology, and (iii) develop combination therapies targeting these signaling axes.
Taken together, these projects will integrate genetics, biochemistry, and proteomics to characterize
therapeutically vulnerable signaling pathways in meningioma and GBM."

In the first 6 months after COVID-19 vaccine approval, 3.4 billion doses were administered globally, potentially
saving 7.2 million lives. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines have been able to induce
both a strong T cell- and antibody-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2 by triggering myeloid antigen
presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), demonstrating the efficacy of LNP-mRNA technology to
modulate the immune system. Partly due to the success of COVID-19 vaccines, there has been a renewed
attention in engineering novel LNP formulations to better modulate the myeloid APC compartment by 1) either
fine-tuning the adjuvanticity of the LNP lipid formulation or 2) improving in vivo targeting efficiency of LNPs
towards myeloid APCs. Although the advancements in LNP lipid chemistry enrich our arsenal of LNP
formulations suited to modulate the immune system, there hasn't been a corresponding detailed understanding
of the molecular and cellular changes induced upon the uptake of LNPs in specific cell types and tissues. In
fact, attempts to elucidate the innate mechanisms of LNP immunogenicity have often led to conflicting
conclusions and have in turn suggested that the mechanisms of LNP immunogenicity are rather LNP
formulation-dependent. The lack of consensus on the innate mechanisms of LNP immunogenicity further
highlight that the immunogenicity of each LNP is a complex function of a) its lipid formulation and the nature of
its payload, b) the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) profile unique to each immune subset, c) LNP targeting
efficiency in each cell type and d) cell, tissue and disease context of LNP treatment. Without the parallel efforts
to gain mechanistic understanding of immunogenicity of each LNP formulation, it remains difficult to rationally
select LNP formulations that are tailored to a particular disease context, including cancer. In using LNPs as a
cancer immunotherapeutic, my central hypothesis states that LNP lipid formulations that drive up their
immunogenicity combined with an engineering strategy to increase specific targeting of DCs in vivo can
synergize with immunostimulatory payloads (i.e. IL-12) to reprogram DC cell states and enhance anti-tumor
immunity. In Aim 1, I will characterize the changes in DC phenotype, function and transcriptional profile upon
uptake of DC-targeted LNPs in both steady state and tumoral contexts using DC-T cell co-cultures, bulk and
scRNA-seq of sorted LNP transfected DCs. In Aim 2, I will engineer Clec9a targeted bi-specific antibodies to
improve LNP transfection of DCs in vivo. The outcome of this project is both a mechanistic understanding of
the interplay between LNPs and DCs that occurs upon LNP uptake and a novel bi-specific antibody-based
strategy to increase DC targeting in vivo."

It has been almost two decades since the completion of the Human Genome Project, yet much of the genome
remains poorly understood. In particular, the function of most of the noncoding genome, which makes up almost
98% of the human genome, is unknown. To be sure, these noncoding sequences do carry functional relevance,
as multiple large-scale biochemical studies, genome-wide association studies, and comparative genomics have
suggested. However, direct evidence linking a noncoding genomic region to its function is limited. The
development of CRISPR-Cas9 has, for the first time, made functional interrogation of the noncoding genome
accessible. Indeed, high-throughput perturbation studies in mammalian cells have been instrumental in
identifying the functions of many noncoding genomic regions. However, in vitro cell cultures are phenotypically
limited to observations at the level of single cells, monolayers, or organoids. These systems cannot fully
recapitulate the wide array of animal physiologies and behaviors relevant to human health. Whole animals, on
the other hand, model a plethora of complex biological processes such as embryonic development, cancer and
metastasis, infection and immunity, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and many more.
Scaling up CRISPR-Cas9 technology for in vivo functional screens, however, has been extremely challenging
due to the cost, labor, and time required to generate mutant animals. A platform that enables large-scale
CRISPR-based perturbation in vivo will open new avenues for whole animal functional genetic screens. I have
developed Multiplexed Intermixed CRISPR Droplets (MIC-Drop), a platform that makes large-scale reverse-
genetic screens possible in zebrafish. The platform is robust and can be scaled-up to target thousands of
genomic regions. This proposal outlines a five-year plan to use the platform to systematically interrogate the
functions of the noncoding genome in vivo. I plan to use comparative genomics to identify two classes of highly
conserved but poorly understood noncoding genomic regions: (1) Poison Exons and (2) Enhancers.
Subsequently, I plan to systematically perturb these elements and assess their functional roles in regulating
vertebrate development and behavior. These exploratory aims will be aided by the simultaneous development
of new and improved tools for genetic perturbation and phenotyping. The tools I develop and the knowledge I
gain from the proposed research project will allow me to establish a successful independent career in functional
genetics. This project also offers significant growth and training opportunities in the form of both formal courses
and meetings as well as collaborations. I have assembled a team of mentors, collaborators, and advisors—
consisting of experts in Comparative Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Developmental Biology—whose support
and mentorship will provide me the necessary training needed for successful completion of the proposed aims.
My research training will be complemented by additional trainings in professional skill development such as
mentoring, lab management, and budgeting ensuring a successful transition to an independent research career."

Research Strategy
Two of the biggest challenges in molecular biomedical research are (1) the lack of technologies for detailed
investigation of protein conformations in the cell or the native environment, and (2) a dearth of data on protein
conformational dynamics for large proteins and across time scales. This proposal addresses both these grand
challenges head-on by developing two closely related technologies: high-throughput disulfide scanning, which
will bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo structural biology by revealing protein structures in both contexts,
and single-molecule FRET scanning, which will reveal both average conformation and pairwise distance
fluctuations across thousands of residue pairs within a protein in a massively parallel format. I will not only
develop these powerful techniques, but also apply them to key biomedical questions: the role of conformational
plasticity in the function of chaperones; the role of conformational dynamics in antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial
transpeptidases; phenotypic effects of kinetically trapped and non-native protein conformations; and structural
basis of genotype-phenotype relationships.
Candidate and Environment
I am a highly trained experimental protein biochemist and biophysicist with extensive experience investigating
the roles of disulfide bonds and redox chemistry in protein structure, stability, misfolding, aggregation, and the
pathogenesis of disease. By carrying out the proposed research, I will acquire crucial technical expertise in
emerging protein sequencing technologies and computational modeling and data analysis algorithms, as well as
a deeper knowledge of statistical physics, microbial physiology, and experimental evolution. Harvard University
and the greater Boston-area academic community provides a stellar environment for academic professional
development. A group of world-leading experts has been recruited as the Advisory Committee. The primary
mentor has a proven track record of training future faculty members at top research-intensive institutions. I will
take full advantage of career-development courses, workshops on inclusive teaching and building communities
of belonging, seminars on leading a research group, guidance and practice in mentorship, and a formal refresher
on responsible conduct of research. I have maintained a high level of productivity throughout my research career
(14 publications in 8 years, starting as an undergraduate), and the work arising from this award will be widely
disseminated and shared."
10995484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lie at the top of the blood hierarchy and are capable of giving rise to all blood
cells of an organism. Consequently, their use has enormous therapeutic potential for the treatment of blood
diseases, and generation of HSCs in vitro is a central aim in regenerative biology. Despite this clinical need, we
lack protocols that allow us to efficiently generate HSCs in vitro that are capable of long-term engraftment and
multi-lineage output. A major hindrance is our incomplete understanding of how HSCs are made in vivo. For
instance, although it is established that blood cells develop from endothelial cells in multiple sites throughout the
embryo, we still do not know which embryonic sites produce long-term HSCs, nor how site of origin impacts on
life-long stem cell function or behavior. Furthermore, we are limited in our understanding of the intrinsic and
extrinsic cues driving functional heterogeneity in hemogenic endothelial cells. This project proposes to use
powerful next-generation barcoding technology to enrich our understanding of the embryonic origin of HSCs and
the hemogenic endothelial cell states that give rise to blood to allow us to harness the process in vitro.
 Dr. Bowling conducted her graduate work in developmental biology and during her postdoctoral training
has focused on the development of next-generation DNA barcoding tools for performing single cell, inducible cell
lineage tracing in vivo. Equipped with this skillset, Dr. Bowling plans to use innovative cellular barcoding
techniques to, for the first time, catalog the precise endothelial origins of long-lived blood progenitors in the
mammalian embryo (Aim 1). Furthermore, she will perform in-depth characterization of the heterogeneous
endothelial cell states that give rise to distinct blood cells in the embryo (Aim 2). The knowledge generated from
these experiments have the potential to answer major, long-standing questions in the field of developmental
hematopoiesis and transform our basic understanding of the steps leading to blood generation, and therefore
revolutionize protocols for HSC generation in vitro.
 Dr. Bowling is supported by a panel of mentors and consultants who are world-class researchers in
hematology, developmental biology, and technology development. Her mentors Drs. Fernando Camargo and
Leonard Zon have made exceptional contributions to the field of hematopoiesis and also have outstanding track-
records for mentorship. Dr. Bowling will gain further scientific training and career development support from her
scientific committee: Drs Jay Shendure, Trista North and Berthold Gottgens. Finally, she will benefit from carrying
out her research program in the scientifically stimulating and resource-rich environment of Boston Children’s
Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The aims in this proposal will allow Dr. Bowling to build on her skills to
gain expert knowledge in the computational analysis of sequencing datasets and the use of induced pluripotent
stem cells, in preparation for her transition to independence. As a result, she will establish a unique niche for
resolving important, clinically-relevant questions in hematopoietic development as an independent researcher."
10996288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are increasingly attributed to the distinct social conditions in which
various social groups age. Socioeconomic and psychosocial factors are known to cause chronic stress that
may increase risk of CVD, but the mechanisms are not fully clear. It is therefore important to identify factors
that mediate or moderate the effects of social stressors on CVD. Geroscientific theory reconceptualizes chronic
disease as a product of sustained dysfunctional aging, offering additional avenues for understanding how the
social environment is internalized to influence health. Work emerging from this literature has identified
epigenetic dimensions of aging such as DNA methylation which appear particularly responsive to psychosocial
stressors. Epigenetic “clocks”, or measures of DNA methylation-based predictors of chronological age, health,
and mortality may serve as useful markers that can provide important missing information on the relationships
between social stressors, aging, and CVD. Furthermore, psychological factors may also play an integral role in
these pathways. Self-concept is a determinant of a number of identity-based psychosocial characteristics
associated with both epigenetic changes and CVD. These include dispositional traits such as optimism and
negative affect, as well as beliefs about self-worth and subjective social status. Importantly, these factors are
also known to influence the way individuals perceive and cope with stress. Antecedent to the psychosocial
traits which influence stressor appraisal and stress-responsive behavior, self-concept may therefore serve as a
viable point of intervening on the subjective identity characteristics which catalyze premature and dysfunctional
aging in the context of social disadvantage and predispose individuals to CVD. Incorporating a geroscientific
perspective, the applicant’s Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model theorizes that certain self-concepts render
individuals particularly vulnerable or resilient to the health effects of social stressors by promoting or preventing
premature aging. The proposed IVP scale (IVPS) aims to measure these novel identity characteristics
hypothesized to predict aging-related psychosocial factors and cardiovascular health. The specific objectives of
the proposed study are to: 1) examine whether psychosocial risk and resilience factors predict biological age
as measured by epigenetic clocks using data combined from the Jackson Heart Study and the Atherosclerosis
Risk In Communities cohorts; and 2) use preliminary qualitative data to develop and finalize items for use in
the IVPS. R00 phase aims include examining the psychometric properties of the IVPS and assessing whether
self-concept as measured by the IVPS predicts CVD-related psychosocial traits and biological aging.
Ultimately, this work has the potential to identify additional targets for addressing racial and gender disparities
in healthy aging and CVD, particularly ways of favorably influencing epigenetic changes associated with
healthy aging."

Significant disparities exist in prevalence, invasiveness and mortality in specific cancers (e.g., cervix, liver, stomach)
and across multiple patient reported outcomes (PROs) regardless of disease site. H/Ls are more likely to present with
advanced disease, greater comorbidities and report greater symptom burden and poorer health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). Survivorship in H/Ls is further compromised by low SES, education and insurance coverage, language
barriers and limited access to care. Survivorship studies in H/Ls have been limited due to: (a) small samples with short
follow-ups; (b) focus on common cancer (e.g., breast or prostate), limiting attention to high-prevalence/mortality sites;
restricted H/L origin and SES representation; and (d) lack of guiding models considering multiple determinants (e.g.,
sociocultural, medical, stress, psychosocial, lifestyle, biological) of survivors’ outcomes. Avanzando Caminos
(Leading Pathways): the Hispanic/Latino Cancer Survivorship Cohort Study will involve recruitment, assessment and
follow-up of ~3,000 H/Ls who completed primary cancer treatment within the past 2 years and are diverse in H/L
background, urban vs. rural residence and cancer site across two major US metropolitan areas—Miami and San
Antonio. Both areas have majority H/L populations (~65% of Miami; ~64% of San Antonio), are diverse regarding H/L
origin and SES and are served by NCI-designated cancer centers. We will recruit a sample that approximates the
diversity of the H/L population in the US (~ 50% Mexican & ~50% other H/L origin). The Florida Cancer Data System
and the Texas Cancer Registry will supplement recruitment (~30% of cohort) and serve to establish
representativeness. Our primary outcomes are symptom burden (e.g., pain, fatigue, depression, cognition), HRQoL
and disease activity (e.g., progression, recurrence, cancer & all-cause mortality). Our transdisciplinary team has a
strong and successful record of academic productivity and collaboration across the five targeted domains that will be
evaluated as determinants of our outcomes: (1) sociocultural (e.g., SES, acculturation, cultural values); (2) stress and
adversity (e.g., chronic and traumatic stress, ethnic-stress); (3) psychosocial (e.g., social support, coping, family
cohesion/conflict); (4) lifestyle and behavioral (e.g., physical activity, nutrition, health information seeking); and (5)
biological (e.g., inflammatory/pro-metastatic gene expression signaling, cardiometabolic markers, genetic admixture).
Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-months, 12-months and annually thereafter. Methods in multilevel latent
longitudinal modeling, cancer genomics and computational biology will be used to test our hypotheses. During the
UG3 phase, we will hire and train staff, establish and finalize study protocols, recruit ~18% of the sample and conduct
preliminary analyses. During the UH3 phase we will complete recruitment, conduct all remaining assessments,
analyze data and disseminate findings to guide and implement secondary and tertiary prevention in H/L survivors."

In this K23 proposal, I outline a comprehensive five-year training program that will prepare me for the transition
to an independent, R01 level investigator capable of developing novel, feasible, and scalable integrative
behavioral interventions to reduce psychological and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older people with
HIV (OPWH). To achieve this goal, my training objectives are to: 1.) develop expertise in mindfulness and
behavior change for CVD risk reduction; 2.) gain experience in randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and
implementation among OPWH; and 3.) develop proficiency in inflammation biomarker research to better my
understanding of the HIV-CVD pathophysiology. In this application, I propose a significant and innovative
research strategy, an amazing interdisciplinary mentorship team, and comprehensive didactic plan to support
these goals. Background: OPWH are disproportionately impacted by CVD attributable to chronic HIV immune
dysregulation and resulting inflammation. Systemic inflammation is exacerbated by psychological distress via
activating the immune response and driving proinflammatory CVD risk behaviors. There is promising evidence
to suggest that mindfulness could be an effective intervention to reduce psychological distress and support
behaviorally- and inflammatory-mediated CVD risk reduction. Specific Aims and Research Design: I propose
to refine and synthesize mindfulness and behavior change content from evidence-based protocols
(mindfulness-based stress reduction and diabetes prevention program) to develop and pilot test a new text
message-enhanced intervention called “One Mind One Heart” (OM-OH) using feedback from semi-structured
interviews with OPWH in psychological distress (N=20), and my multidisciplinary mentorship team (Aim 1).
Next, I will explore, via an open pilot (N=5) with exit interviews and pre-post self-report assessments, the initial
acceptability of OM-OH and further refine OM-OH as needed (Aim 2). Finally, I will conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N=50) to a.) evaluate benchmarks of feasibility and acceptability of study methods and
refined OM-OH compared to enhanced usual care, and b.) investigate potential for effects on psychological
distress, inflammation, and behavioral CVD risk (Aim 3). Findings will provide the foundation for an R01
application to conduct an efficacy trial of OM-OH to reduce inflammatory-mediated CVD risk among OPWH.
Training and Mentorship: My training plan will be led by my co-primary mentors Drs. Conall O’Cleirigh and
Gloria Yeh, both renowned researchers focused on intervention development and clinical trials for HIV and
cardiovascular disease, respectively. I will also be supported by a.) a team of expert co-mentors and
collaborators, b.) a rich institutional environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical
School, and c.) targeted coursework, scientific meetings, seminars, and planned publications. Relevance to
NHLBI: This K23 is in line with the published research priorities of the NHLBI HIV/AIDS program to address
HIV-related cardiovascular comorbidities."

10979053,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chromatin 3D structure plays an important role in fundamental genomics processes. A variety of experimental
methods, such as Hi-C, GAM, SPRITE, and HiChIP, have been developed to characterize chromatin architecture
and DNA-DNA interactions genome-wide. Meanwhile, other types of data, such as gene expression and chromatin
accessibility profiles, have also been used to refine our understanding of gene regulation and chromatin structure.
However, computational tools that can jointly analyze Hi-C and other types of data are still lacking, hindering the
process of comprehensively understanding the relationship between genome structure and function. Moreover, the
heterogeneous, large-scale, noisy and high-dimensional nature of these data presents computational challenges
for effectively integrating Hi-C data with other types of data.
 Here, we propose to develop a series of machine learning models that integrate contact matrices with RNA-seq,
genome sequence, and ATAC-seq data to advance chromatin structure analysis. First, to identify the dynamic in-
terplay between cell-type-specific gene expression and chromatin structure, we will extend our Sagittarius model,
which obtains state-of-the-art results in modeling RNA-seq time series, to analyze Hi-C time-course data by ex-
plicitly modeling the time dimension. This new model will enable spatio-temporal analyses of chromatin structures
for differentiation, development, and disease progression. Second, genome sequence has been successfully
used to predict 3D genome folding but has not been fully exploited for resolution enhancement. We will develop
a graph-based framework to co-embed genome sequences and low-coverage contact matrices for resolution en-
hancement. The imputed high-resolution data will enable biologists to identify 3D chromatin features that can
only be discovered at high resolution, such as punctate loops and sub-domains. Third, the view of chromatin
architecture provided by a contact matrix has not been fully integrated with the linear, high-resolution picture of
local chromatin architecture provided by ATAC-seq data. We will develop a translation model between Hi-C and
ATAC-seq, which will be used to analyze cell types or species that only have one of these two modalities. This
translation model will provide a consolidated view of 3D chromatin architecture and further advance downstream
analyses of regulatory processes, such as promoter-enhancer interactions, replication timing, gene expression,
and mRNA splicing.
 All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and pre-trained
models will be made publicly available, providing a valuable resource for users interested in understanding chro-
matin 3D architecture and its relationship to gene expression and other functional cellular processes."
10979054,"Project Summary. Our ability to internally sense body and limb position, referred to as proprioception, is
essential for purposeful movement and is known to be impaired in a variety of conditions such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, and aging. Conversely, activation of peripheral proprioceptive pathways
promotes recovery from spinal cord injury, highlighting the translational relevance of understanding how
proprioception is encoded. Proprioceptors, the sensory neurons that initiate proprioceptive signaling, require
Piezo2 to transduce muscle movement into electrical signals for normal motor function. What happens
downstream of Piezo2 activation is debated. We will address a fundamental yet unanswered question in the field
of sensory-motor neuroscience: how do voltage- gated sodium channels (NaVs) shape proprioceptor function in
sensory-motor circuits? Mammalian proprioceptors express three NaVs: NaV1.1, NaV1.6, and NaV1.7. Our lab
has published the only functional evidence to date on the contributions of any NaV to mammalian proprioception.
Because the genetic access point to proprioceptors is parvalbumin, a protein also expressed in brain and spinal
cord neurons, we used a sensory-neuron wide genetic targeting strategy that spares the confounding factors
associated with NaV deletion in the central nervous system. We reported that loss of the NaV1.1 isoform results
in inconsistent proprioceptor coding of sustained muscle stretch and visible motor behavior deficits. Our new
pilot data support the notion that while NaV1.1 is tasked with maintaining reliable proprioceptive transmission,
the NaV1.6 isoform is tasked with initiating proprioceptive signaling. The role of NaV1.7 in shaping proprioceptive
signaling remains unknown and will be directly investigated for the first time in this proposal. We will leverage
inducible conditional knockout mouse models to systematically delete individual Navs after proprioceptor
development and investigate how NaV1.1, NaV1.6, and NaV1.7 distinctly contribute to mammalian proprioception.
Using a combination of behavior and mechanistic in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiological experiments, we aim
to determine how acute disruption of NaV expression post-weaning impacts motor behaviors, and will also identify
NaV subtype-specific biophysical features that govern proprioceptor excitability. These studies will be
complemented by quantitative immunohistochemistry and super-resolution imaging to identify the cellular
localization of each NaV isoform within proprioceptors. We will also use ex vivo muscle-nerve recordings and
optogenetics to define how NaVs expressed in proprioceptors individually shape peripheral neurotransmission,
which will inform interpretation of our behavioral analyses. Finally, we will determine which NaVs are essential
for proprioceptor synaptic transmission in central circuits using two different ex vivo spinal cord electrophysiology
preparations. Collectively, this work will advance our fundamental understanding of mammalian proprioception
and illuminate the specific and distinct roles of NaVs in sensory-driven motor behavior, which will contribute new
insights into neurological conditions in which proprioception is impaired."

The brain is a unique environment in the context of infection. Many brain cells are long-lived and irreplaceable.
To combat central nervous system (CNS) infection, the immune system must control the pathogen while
preserving such cells. Thus, infection with intracellular pathogens, like the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that
infects nearly one-third of the world population, offers a complex challenge. Programmed cell death is a common
mechanism for limiting intracellular pathogen replication. The cell death pathways that are operational in the
brain to limit CNS infection are just beginning to be defined. T. gondii is primarily controlled by T cells that produce
the cytokine IFN-g, but parasites persist within neurons, raising questions regarding the presence of cell-intrinsic
defense mechanisms of neurons and other CNS-resident cells. We find that caspase-8, an inducer of
programmed cell death, is essential for the control of T. gondii in the brain. We find high parasite burdens in the
brains of mice lacking caspase-8 despite the presence of a strong immune response, suggesting that caspase-
8 functions in addition to defined immune mediators to protect the brain. To determine which cell types harbor
parasite in the absence caspase-8, we infected cre-reporter mice with cre-secreting parasites to label all cells
that encounter parasite. As expected, we observe infected neurons in wildtype mice, but in mice lacking caspase-
8, we observed far more infected cells, including: neurons, astrocytes, and CD8+ T cells. We hypothesize that
caspase-8 in each of these cell types is required to restrict T. gondii, which we will test in two aims. In Specific
Aim 1, we will test if CNS-resident neurons and astrocytes need caspase-8 to control T. gondii in the brain. To
test this question, we have generated mice with floxed alleles of Casp8 on a Ripk3 knockout (to prevent
necroptosis) and cre-reporter background. Using AAVs, we will drive the expression of cre in specific cell types.
We will measure parasite burden, visualize infected cells using confocal microscopy, and assess tissue
pathology and neuronal health. Together, the experiments in this aim will address whether cell-intrinsic or
extrinsic caspase-8 activity is required to control T. gondii in CNS-resident cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will test
the role of caspase-8 in CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells are the predominant immune cell type that encounters T.
gondii in in the brains of Casp8Ripk3 knockout mice. Previous reports have indicated that CD8+ T cells are
infected by parasites in wildtype mice, raising questions about the fate of the parasites in these cells. We
hypothesize that caspase-8 mediated cell death is an essential restriction mechanism in CD8+ T cells. To test
this, we will infect mice that lack Casp8 specifically in T cells using a CD8a-cre and examine how cell death limits
parasite spread and replication. Then, we will culture CD8+ T cells to understand how caspase-8 contributes to
parasite control using genetic knockouts and activators and inhibitors of caspase-8. Lastly, we will use in vivo
experiments to test the importance of activators of caspase-8, TNF-a and FasL, in T cells during infection.
Together, this proposal will explore how specific cell types utilize caspase-8 to control brain infection."

Although actin is highly conserved throughout eukarya, the mechanisms used to regulate its assembly and
disassembly vary across phyla. Precisely timed and placed actin assembly orchestrates nearly every cellular
process, including cell migration. While actin-driven cell migration has been defined in some detail in animal
cells, it is unknown if diverse eukaryotic pathogens operate using the same set of rules. This proposal will
address the hypothesis that there are conserved principles of cell migration by investigating Naegleria, which
diverged from the “yeast-to-human” lineage over a billion years ago. Specifically, this work will define the
contributions of the cytoskeleton to cell crawling in the “brain-eating amoeba” Naegleria fowleri: a pathogen
that crawls into and within the brain, causing a deadly form of meningitis for which there are no reliable
treatments. Dr. Velle’s initial postdoctoral research using the commonly-used, non-pathogenic model system
Naegleria gruberi highlights the potential for universal rules of motility; N. gruberi crawls on flat surfaces using
thin, actin- based protrusions assembled by proteins called the Arp2/3 complex. This actin and Arp2/3 based
mechanism is also how animal cells crawl on flat surfaces. However, outside of laboratory conditions, cells
rarely—if ever—crawl on flat, uniform surfaces. Animal cells are well-known to switch to a different mode of
motility when crawling through complex, restrictive environments, but this has not been tested in Naegleria.
Because N. fowleri crawl through narrow channels in the skull and into the brain, despite no known
chemotactic signals, dissecting cell migration in restrictive environments is essential for understanding disease.
Therefore, Aim 1 will determine mechanisms of cell crawling under confinement at the level of cell behavior.
Aim 2 will focus on the actin networks in cells; while the protrusions driving N. gruberi migration on flat surfaces
look similar to those of animal cells, defining the actin architecture using Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy
(PREM) will reveal if the ultrastructure is conserved. This aim will also provide critical training to complement
Dr. Velle’s background in light microscopy. The world expert in PREM, Dr. Svitkina, will provide this training as
a member of the scientific advisory committee. Aim 3 will use biochemistry—a technique the applicant has no
prior training in—to examine the upstream mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex activation. Dr. Velle has recruited
Dr. Bruce Goode, an expert actin biochemist, for this training. Because the leading labs in the field of cell
migration frequently employ both microscopy and in vitro actin biochemistry, the proposed training in PREM
and biochemistry will ensure the applicant is skilled in the techniques required for success. Dr. Velle has also
recruited Dr. Matt Welch, an actin expert, Dr. Meg Titus, who has expertise in actin and amoebae, and Dr. Jim
Morris, an expert in N. fowleri, to her scientific advisory committee to provide scientific and career mentoring.
Collectively, the proposed work will provide the technical training, and career mentorship required to launch Dr.
Velle’s career as an independent investigator with a research program focused on Naegleria’s migration."
10982684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently-described SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-NDD) is caused by pathogenic
variants in the gene SCN3A, which encodes the sodium (Na+) channel subunit Nav1.3. SCN3A-NDD is a
devastating condition defined by treatment-resistant epilepsy and severe/profound intellectual disability (ID);
surprisingly, many patients also exhibit malformation of cortical development (MCD), a developmental
disturbance in the structural formation of the cerebral cortex of the brain, suggesting functional roles for Nav1.3
during embryological development. How genetic variants in SCN3A leads to epilepsy and neurodevelopmental
disability, and how SCN3A variants lead to MCD, is unknown. Research is required to clarify the functional role
of Nav1.3 during early brain development and to progress towards novel therapies or preventative measures
for SCN3A-NDD, which is currently and untreatable disorder.
This 5-year collaborative application employs novel tools and innovative neuroscience approaches to test the
hypothesis that pathogenic variants in SCN3A lead to a disorder that includes epilepsy and MCD via
dysregulated Na+ currents in migrating neurons of the developing cerebral cortex.
Electrophysiological recordings in heterologous cell systems indicate that pathogenic SCN3A variants found in
patients with SCN3A-NDD largely produce Na+ channels that exhibit gain of function due to increased
persistent current and alterations in the voltage dependence of channel activation, which increase channel
activity. However, the mechanistic basis of observed variability in epilepsy severity and presence or absence of
MCD, is unclear. And how altered channel activity impacts the function of neurons has not been investigated.
Proposed experiments will determine the relationship between specific SCN3A variants and correlated clinical
phenotype (epilepsy, MCD, severity of ID) in a large cohort of human patients with SCN3A-NDD. To link
SCN3A variants to dysfunction of ion channels and neurons, we will compare the biophysical properties of
normal Na+ channels to channels containing variant Nav1.3; test cell-intrinsic effects of SCN3A variants in
neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from human SCN3A-NDD patients; and test effects of
variant overexpression via in utero electroporation of mouse embryo followed by electrical recording in brain
slices (Aim 1). The impact of variant SCN3A on the morphology of immature neurons and cytoarchitecture of
the developing cerebral cortex will inform the role of SCN3A in development (Aim 2). To translate these
findings towards clinical applications, we will attempt to ameliorate features of SCN3A-NND in advanced model
systems, including a newly generated conditional point mutant mouse, via targeted manipulation of pathogenic
Nav1.3-mediated Na+ current (Aim 3).
Results will provide novel information on the role of Nav1.3 during brain development, and will define the
pathogenic mechanisms of SCN3A-NDD towards development of novel, targeted therapies in human patients."

 Early environmental and genetic influences exert significant effects on risk for Substance Use Disorders
(SUDs). Understanding precursors to SUDs, such as externalizing behavior, that come online prior to the
initiation of substances allows for earlier identification and potentially, ability to intervene on those phenotypes
before behaviors become disorders. This R34 application proposes to establish a bidirectional translational team
and generate preliminary data for an R01 application designed to identify both behavioral and genetic risk factors
for neurocognitive phenotypes that precede SUDs. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which early life environment
influences neurocognitive development and the relationship between neurocognitive development and adult
delay-discounting behavior. Aim 2 will identify genomic network signatures of early life resource scarcity from
publicly available datasets and determine the extent to which expression of identified hub genes is associated
with neurocognitive behavioral outcomes related to substance use disorder. Aim 3 will allow for generation of
polygenic risk scores for externalizing-related phenotypes in GWAS datasets and assess the extent to which
these polygenic risk scores predict precursors to SUD behaviors such as impulsivity in the ABCD Study. This
aim will also determine whether these aggregate genetic risk scores are moderated by aspects of environment
within the ABCD Study. Ultimately, the cross-species approach used here will provide support for an innovative
R01 that will leverage preliminary data generated by this study to assess the most influential early life moderators
of risk behavior development (identified in Aim 3) which can be systematically assessed in a preclinical
developmental behavioral framework (established in Aim 1) and mechanistically assessed through cutting-edge
neuroscience techniques focused on critical gene targets (identified in Aim 2). This project is strengthened by
the translational team with expertise in early life environmental factors impacting neurocognitive development
(Dr. Neigh), polygenic risk for externalizing phenotypes and substance use phenotypes in humans, structural
and longitudinal modeling (Dr. Bountress), neuroepigenetics of stress and addiction (Dr. Hamilton), and
translational rat models of drug addiction and neurocognitive behaviors (Dr. Banks). The research described
herein pairs sophisticated modeling via latent profile analyses (LPA) with animal data, proposes to aggregate
existing RNAseq datasets to identify candidate hub genes, and integrates approaches that encompass early life
resource manipulations, linking these conditions with measures of impulsivity using delay discounting in
adulthood."

The goal of the parent grant is to determine the role of oxidative stress in astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) upregulation. The supplemental research addresses a related but in depth mechanism to investigate the
role of GFAP and a related protein, vimentin in seizure-induced astrogliosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative
stress and neuroinflammation are implicated as mediators of epilepsy and/or its comorbidities. The in depth
mechanisms underlying seizure-induced astrogliosis, particularly the upregulation of GFAP remain at large. We
have observed robust transcriptional upregulation of GFAP and vimentin in mice lacking the mitochondrial anti-
oxidant manganese superoxide dismutase-2 (Sod2) in forebrain neurons. The goal of these studies is to utilize
primary neuronal-glial cultures to determine the role of reactive cysteine residues in GFAP and vimentin as the
triggers for astrogliosis. Aim 1 will test the ability of two redox cycling compounds for their ability to activate
GFAP mRNA expression as a result of posttranslational redox modification of a conserved cysteines in GFAP
and vimentin. Studies will determine if neuronal and specifically mitochondrial ROS is sufficient to induce GFAP
upregulation and astrogliosis in vitro using mixed rat neuronal culture. Aim 2 will determine if upregulation of
GFAP and vimentin protein expression in mixed neuronal cultures occurs due to redox modification. These
studies could reveal mechanisms by which astrogliosis is initiated in neurological diseases such as epilepsy."
10984366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The aggregation of misfolded proteins is a prominent pathological feature in most age-related
neurodegenerative diseases. This includes Huntington's disease (HD) and various spinocerebellar ataxias,
inherited diseases caused by expanded, aggregation-prone polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in specific
proteins. Understanding how cells prevent the misfolding of these mutant polyQ proteins holds the potential to
reveal therapeutic strategies not only for polyQ disorders but also for other neurodegenerative conditions.
 I conducted large-scale CRISPR screens for modifiers of polyQ protein aggregation in human cells that
revealed DNAJC7, an Hsp40 co-chaperone, as a top hit. Molecular chaperones are a diverse group of proteins
that assist in proper protein folding, but we lack knowledge about the specific endogenous chaperones most
effective in preventing polyQ protein aggregation, along with their roles in neurons. Importantly, DNAJC7 is
highly expressed in neurons and has connections to other neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the central
hypothesis of this proposal: DNAJC7 is a key neuronal Hsp40 capable of selectively inhibiting aggregation of
amyloidogenic proteins, including mutant polyQ proteins. Aim 1 of this proposal will investigate the impact of
DNAJC7 expression on disease phenotypes in neuronal models of HD, while Aim 2 will delve into DNAJC7’s
mechanism and range of selectivity for different amyloidogenic disease proteins.
 My long-term goal is to establish myself as an academic neuropathologist with a research program
dedicated to studying neuronal protein homeostasis pathways in neurodegeneration. This proposal outlines a
comprehensive 5-year mentored career development plan that will provide me the essential knowledge and
scientific training necessary to successfully transition to this goal. The training plan includes acquiring various
new skills in cutting-edge techniques spanning microscopy, CRISPR functional genomics in iPSC neurons, and
proteomics, as well as enhancing skills in bioinformatics and statistics. Additionally, the training plan covers the
development of professional skills needed to successfully launch and manage a laboratory, including scientific
communication, grant writing, and lab management.
 To achieve these objectives, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team with complementary
expertise, and includes Dr. Martin Kampmann (mentor), Dr. Eric Huang (co-mentor), and advisory members
Dr. Jason Gestwicki, Dr. Steven Finkbeiner, Dr. Lea Grinberg, and Dr. Arun Wiita. UCSF provides an
exceptional research environment, equipped with cutting-edge technologies and a range of leaders across
multiple disciplines. This proposal will empower me with the necessary skills to establish a thriving and
rigorous independent laboratory, merging with my neuropathology training to become a leader in
neurodegenerative disease research."

Chorioamnionitis (chorio) is the most common cause of preterm birth. Chorio increases the risk for fetal and
neonatal mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are no effective therapies for preventing
preterm birth, chorio, or BPD. I have previously shown that preterm birth due to chorio is propagated by IL-1
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1). Preliminary data from my human and mouse transcriptome & cytokine
analysis demonstrate increased Th17 activation, and poor lung and cardiac function in mice exposed to chorio.
The central hypothesis is that chorio induces specific alterations of the fetal immune system via
stimulation of the IRAK1 pathway, resulting in lung parenchymal and vascular injury.
We will test the hypotheses with the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that human infants exposed to chorio have increased Th17 cell
activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine generation leading to long-term adverse lung
function & pulmonary hypertension. I will conduct a prospective cohort study on 152 preterm infants (<32
weeks GA) (exposed and non-exposed to chorio). I will determine changes in IRAK1 mRNA levels and immune
cell profiles in blood and tracheal aspirate, and measure lung mechanics using non-invasive oscillometry. The
analysis will test the relationship of mRNA and cytokine levels and immune cell population with lung function and
echocardiogram.
Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that newborn mice exposed to chorio have increased Th17 cell
activation via the IRAK1 pathway leading to long-term immune cell dysfunction and adverse lung
physiology. I will test if exposure to chorio alters pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and immune cell
populations in pups of wild type (WT) and IRAK1 KO mice. Lung mechanics will be tested by oscillometry, and
cardiac function assessed by echocardiography. Lungs will be harvested for histology, transcriptomic &
characterization of immune cell profile."

 Once considered a distant threat, climate change is now dramatically increasing the likelihood of
potentially preventable adverse impacts on human health and wellbeing.1 Implementing evidence-based

support adaptation at scale by identifying factors affecting uptake of evidence-based interventions.4,5 The
mission of the University of Washington (UW) Research and Engagement on Adaptation for Climate and

10985670,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysbiosis, an alteration of the gut microbiome associated with chronic diseases, has been previously described
in patients with cirrhosis. Common features of dysbiosis include reduced bacterial diversity and the outgrowth of
the family of human pathogenic bacteria Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli. Infectious
complications, namely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia, are deadly for patients with
cirrhosis with up to 50% mortality. E. coli is one of the most common causes of these infections, thought to derive
from bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium from reduced barrier function. While this suggests a
connection between dysbiosis and disseminated infection, the underlying risk factors of disseminated infection
are not well understood in this population. Lactulose, a simple carbohydrate which is the first line treatment for
the cirrhosis complication hepatic encephalopathy, has been associated with higher abundance of E. coli in the
gut microbiota. Our work demonstrates that lactulose also increases colonization of Enterobacteriaceae, by
overcoming carbon limitation in the colon for these pathogens. My preliminary data show that E. coli acquire
mutations allowing it to utilize lactulose as a carbohydrate source both in culture and in the mouse gut, thus
increasing its fitness. This phenotype is dependent upon constitutive expression of the lactose (lac) operon via
deactivation of the transcriptional regulatory protein LacI, a repressor of the lac operon, which encodes the
lactulose metabolizing enzyme β-galactosidase. I therefore hypothesize that lactulose treatment selects for
mutant Enterobacteriaceae capable of metabolizing lactulose, thereby increasing colonization and the risk of
disseminated infection in patients with liver disease. My objectives in this proposal are to characterize the gain
of function mutations that enable lactulose metabolism by E. coli, determine the competitive advantage imparted
by these mutations, and assess the impact of lactulose on disseminated infection in mice and humans with liver
disease. My hypothesis will be tested through two inter-related Specific Aims that will evaluate the adaptive
mutations and competitive fitness imparted by lactulose treatment to E. coli (Aim 1) and test the impact of
lactulose on disseminated infection (Aim 2). This proposal takes advantage of several innovative techniques
and unique resources including a novel mouse model of disseminated infection in liver disease and creation of
a human disseminated infection strain library. The University of Pennsylvania is an ideal research environment
for these studies given the local expertise in gut microbiome, pathogen biology, and comparative bacterial
genomics. The candidate will acquire critical skills for his career development as an independent investigator,
including in bioinformatics, bacterial genomics, and mouse disease modeling. Successful completion of this
proposal will enable the investigator to reach their career goal to become an independently funded tenure-track
faculty member, identifying the dietary and bacterial factors involved in gastrointestinal diseases."

amyloid from blood vessels with cerebral amyloid antipathy (CAA). APOE4 allele is one of the strongest risk factors for AD and
has been shown to promote cerebrovascular lesions such as CAA and microhemorrhages. Because CAA is universally observed
in AD, further investigation of APOE4-dependent mechanisms driving CAA and ARIA-events is needed. Activated microglia
have been shown to drive the outcome and pace of APOE-mediated neurodegeneration. Importantly, microglia can modulate
cerebrovascular integrity and cerebral blood flow, and release factors which contribute to BBB breakdown, cerebrovascular cell
damage and neurovascular injury. In our studies, we revealed an increase in inflammatory pathways in AD vs control human
cerebrovessels, and this was more prominent in APOE4 carriers, who also had higher CAA scores. Anti-Aβ antibody related
ARIA has also been associated with reactive microgliosis in a primate model of CAA. In humans, in vivo PET imaging of
microglial activation has been associated with the magnitude and severity of ARIA. No preclinical models have evaluated this
association between activated microglia response and ARIA-events, particularly in the context of APOE4 genotype. In this
proposal, we will address these unknowns by utilizing microglial ablation and repopulation techniques in a previously described
chronic anti-Aβ treated EFAD mouse model of AD expressing human APOE isoforms and AD mutations (i.e., aducanumab
treated E3FAD and E4FAD mice). From these studies, we will generate a detailed time-course of cognitive function, cerebral
blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity, and characterize the histopathological and biochemical level changes to the
cerebrovasculature. No studies have characterized the cerebrovascular cell phenotypes in ARIA patients. We will thus employ a
single cell transcriptomic approach to characterize the phenotypic brain vascular cell type response(s) in our EFAD models
following aducanumab treatment with/without macrophage depletion and repopulation, and reveal key upstream regulators
driving these unique vascular cell responses at the single cell level. From this proposal, our goal is to reveal whether activated
microglia mediated cerebrovascular inflammation contributes to APOE4 mediated ARIA events following aducanumab
treatment, and ii) identify novel targets through which APOE4 confers these vascular-specific abnormalities, to reveal new
opportunities for improved antibodies and adjunct therapies that can one day minimize these complications in APOE4 patients
with AD."

Obesity is an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With obesity prevalence at 37% and rising,
the urgency to uncouple obesity from AD is pressing. Understanding the molecular connection between obesity
and AD is crucial to disrupt this link.
The Principal Investigator (PI) has reported accelerated neurolocomotor decline in a C. elegans model of diet-
induced obesity (DIO)—the most common form of obesity in humans. Moreover, the PI has pioneered single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in adult C. elegans, utilizing it to delineate the transcriptomes of lean and obese
worms with single-cell precision. These studies have shown that DIO prompts a greater than 30-fold induction of
a gene named Modulator of AGgregation 4 (moag-4). It has been established that elevated levels of the MOAG-4
protein induce early-onset protein aggregation and other cellular AD-like phenotypes in C. elegans, mice, and
human cultured cells. This increase is causatively associated with behavioral and cognitive declines in both
worms and mice. Based on the present evidence, the PI hypothesizes that moag-4 is a causal link between
obesity and AD. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAi-mediated suppression of moag-4 attenuates the
neurolocomotor decline typically observed in obese C. elegans.
During the two-year tenure of this exploratory award, the PI aims to: 1) Genetically identify the molecular
pathway/s through which obesity activates moag-4 in C. elegans neurons, and 2) Identify the specific aspects of
obesity-induced neurological and motor decline that are mediated by moag-4.
Following this R21 phase, the research would expand to include mouse models to ascertain if the pathways
identified in worms are conserved in mammals. The overarching objective is to delineate the moag-4/SERF2
pathway that connects obesity to AD with sufficient precision to therapeutically target it, ultimately mitigating
the impact of AD on individuals, caregivers, and the wider society."
10987471,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Modernization of SPF Rodent Housing in Shared-Use Animal Facility at Einstein
The Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institute for Animal Studies (IAS) facilitates high-quality animal
biomedical research and teaching while ensuring the most humane care possible. The IAS provides
comprehensive support for the generation, housing, and analysis of various animal models relevant to public
health, including animal models of human cancer and transgenic animals used in both basic and translational
research. Animal models of human disease are often developed using immune-deficient animals, requiring
careful biocontainment controls to protect their health to the fullest extent possible and reduce variability
associated with unplanned infection. We propose to establish a specialized sub-facility within the shared-use
specific pathogen–free (SPF) rodent housing facilities in the Chanin Building. This sub-facility will support basic
and preclinical research involving highly immunodeficient mice conducted by researchers affiliated with several
NIH-funded Centers, including the Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Institute for
Aging Research (IAR), Einstein-Mount Sinai Diabetes Research Center, and the National Cancer Institute
(NCI)-designated Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center (MECCC). Currently, barrier SPF mice
housed in the Chanin Building are maintained in static, filter-top microisolator cages. The microenvironment of
static cages is entirely dependent on the capacity of the HVAC system to provide fresh temperature- and
humidity-conditioned air, the airflow dynamics within the room, and animal cage stocking density. The inability
of the HVAC system to adequately manage heat and vapor loads can cause increased heat and humidity and
the accumulation of potentially dangerous microenvironments within each cage. Currently, we compensate for
these issues by increasing the frequency of cage changes. However, this extra husbandry activity is
burdensome for both our animal care staff and the animals we care for, resulting in increased animal handling
and a lack of stability in their microenvironments, which can introduce unnecessary stress and increase the
risks of introducing infection. In addition, frequent cage changes by our staff can create difficulties for
investigators who require frequent access to their animals. To support research conducted in
immunocompromised, immunodeficient, and transgenic animals, we will replace the racks and static, filter-top
cages in the sub-facility with new racks that support the use of individually ventilated cages, which will enhance
the biosafety of the animal microenvironment by ensuring adequate flow of sterile air and reduce the frequency
at which cages require changing. In addition, the proposed racks will increase the overall housing capacity of
the facility. Increased capacity will be needed to support the increased interest in and usage of preclinical
animal model development. In addition, our current recruitment initiatives will increase the number of
investigators who require animal housing."

leading global cause of death and a major contributor to disability and dependency in this
demographic. A high salt diet and high blood pressure increase the risk of dementia. However,
how these risk factors contribute to a progressive decline in brain function is poorly understood.
Our lab developed a novel mouse model where we can induce large blood pressure fluctuations,
while maintaining average blood pressure within normal ranges. We will use this animal model of
blood pressure variability (BPV), in combination with a high salt diet (HSD) in middle-aged mice,
thereby recapitulating human risk factors for cognitive decline. The primary goal is to determine if
the combined presence of these variables (HSD+BPV) leads to the early onset of cognitive
decline and/or hypertension. We will investigate whether HSD + BPV: 1) Evokes larger blood
pressure fluctuations and leads to sustained hypertension? 2) Decreases cerebral perfusion,
under steady-state conditions? 3) Increases damage to the microcirculation resulting in a leaky
blood brain barrier (BBB)? and 4) Impairs cognitive function and neurovascular outputs? Findings

10986866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often show altered responsivity to incoming sensory stimuli (i.e.,
hyper-reactivity, hypo-reactivity, sensory seeking), which is associated with increased ASD symptom severity.
One possible reason underlying differences in sensory processing in ASD could be attributed to attention, mainly
differences in disengaging attention from task at hand and reorienting to other stimuli in one’s surroundings.
However, more research is needed to thoroughly understand the link between attention and sensory behaviors
in ASD. There is increasing research indicating that sensory reactivity differences also occur in other
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ASD and
ADHD share some overlapping genetic factors and often co-occur. Yet little is known about the shared and
distinct early symptoms, including sensory behaviors, that precede the identification of these conditions and thus
may be useful in differential diagnosis. Additionally, similar to ASD, attentional differences are also reported in
children with ADHD and may potentially play a role in sensory reactivity. Thus, concurrent examination of sensory
behaviors, and the underlying role of attention in explaining some of these sensory differences, prior to diagnosis
of ASD or ADHD is vital to understanding the way in which sensory differences contribute to symptom
development. The goal of this study is to compare behavioral patterns of sensory reactivity between 12- and 24-
month-olds at risk for ASD (with an older sibling with ASD, n=60), ADHD (with a sibling/parent with ADHD, n=60),
and infants at low risk (no family history of ASD/ADHD, n=40), and to understand the link between attentional
disengagement and sensory response patterns, including whether such links are similar or different across
familial risk groups. Additionally, because altered sensory responsivity is linked with social communication and
self-regulatory difficulties, we will examine concurrent and predictive associations between sensory profiles
observed during early development and ASD and ADHD symptomatology. The proposed project will accomplish
its objectives by utilizing a prospective longitudinal design wherein sensory reactivity and attentional measures
will be administered at various time points (12 and 24 months) and symptom severity (i.e., dimensional ASD and
ADHD traits) will be analyzed at 12 and 24 months in infants identified as being at high and low risk for ASD and
ADHD. In order to increase the rigor of our research we will use both a parent-report sensory questionnaire
(Sensory Experiences Questionnaire) as well as an objective lab-based observational measure (Sensory
Processing Assessment) to examine sensory behaviors. More thorough examination of the link between
attention and sensory behaviors will be crucial as it will highlight potential mechanisms explaining some of the
sensory differences that are observed across NDDs. This may lead to better understanding of the core and
associated symptoms of different NDDs and provide a route for developing and refining interventions/supports."

The recent completion of a Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) human genome has demonstrated that, in principle,
existing sequencing technologies allow gapless and nearly error-free, assembly of complex, human-sized
genomes. Despite these technological advancements, genome assemblies that are currently being generated
and released in public archives are still incomplete and contain a significant number of errors, which can
dramatically impact downstream analyses. Algorithms that can generate T2T genomes are still in their infancy.
The few that are available require extensive manual validation and curation and have so far worked on only a
handful of model species. Dedicated algorithms and software tools are essential for achieving T2T assembly
completeness and accuracy in all species. In particular, extensive evaluation and sophisticated manipulation of
genome assembly graphs are required for T2T genome assembly. To this end, an efficient tool suite is missing.
To bridge this gap, gfastar, a suite of algorithms and tools created for the evaluation and manipulation of
assembly graphs will be further advanced and continuously maintained. Gfastar is under active development,
and it is currently used by large-scale initiatives aimed at the generation of high-quality reference genomes such
as the Vertebrate Genomes Project. Gfastar is powered by a dedicated C++ library, gfalibs. Gfalibs will be
expanded to provide a comprehensive library dedicated to genome sequences and assembly graphs that can
support multiple file formats commonly used by the genome assembly community (e.g. FASTA, FASTQ, GFA1/2,
AGP, GAF, BAM, and FASTG), parallelized input/output (I/O) processing and many other general purpose
functions and utilities. This library will be extensively used by the whole gfastar software ecosystem (rdeval,
gfastats, gfalign, kcount, kreeq, teloscope, and gfase). Currently, several modules have already been
implemented in gfastar. These existing modules will be expanded with additional functionalities and new tools
will be developed. All these tools will synergistically contribute to the generation of T2T reference genomes at
scale. As a whole, the gfastar tool suite will provide unparallelled algorithms and functionalities for assembly
graph evaluation, manipulation and analysis, significantly supporting the genomic community by helping improve
the completeness and accuracy of genomes."

Bioaerosols are small particles suspended in the air that contain living organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and
viruses, and have caused some of the most severe and costly diseases, including the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Among the various factors, the bioaerosol particle size plays a crucial role in all stages of transmission, including
the generation locations and mechanisms in the host's respiratory system, the suspension time and the traveling
distance (short-range vs. long-range), and the final deposition efficiency and location into the recipient's
respiratory system. Despite significant interest in this area over the past few years, current methods to generate
bioaerosols cannot produce bioaerosols with uniform size and sufficient quantity to allow reliable measurement
of pathogens that remain infectious over a long time period. Furthermore, no single method can cover the
complete size range of bioaerosols from the human respiratory system. As a result, the field has suffered from
the lack of capability to study important and basic questions, including how size in the entire respirable bioaerosol
range and respiratory activities (coughing, speaking, sneezing, etc.) influences how infectious pathogens
transmit under different environmental conditions (such as relative humidity, UV lights, ventilation). This
proposed research aims to address these critical limitations. Our central hypothesis is that the bioaerosol size
and size distribution due to respiratory activities have a significant impact on how the airborne pathogens stay
infectious in the air as a function of environmental conditions, and a virtual impact design produces monodisperse
pathogen-laden bioaerosols and in sufficient quantities to detect live pathogens to study the size-viability decay
rate relationship. We will test respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which disproportionally affects infants under 2
years old. It is critical to understand how RSV is transmitted while there is scarce data in the area of RSV
transmission studies. The overall objective of this project is to design and build an easy-to-manufacture and
easy-to-use bioaerosols generation system and investigate the crucial role of size in the bioaerosol viability
decay under various environmental conditions. Our specific aims are (1) to determine the size-viability decay
relationship for RSV with monodisperse bioaerosols and (2) to estimate the viability decay rate of different
respiratory activities with a few well-characterized log-normal distributions. The success of this proposed work
will provide a new scientific tool to generate monodispersed bioaerosols with sufficient quantity for viability
assays and elucidate the key contribution of bioaerosol size on pathogen viability in different environmental
conditions. Furthermore, our work will reveal how respiratory activities impact pathogen transmission. These
tools and insights can lead to future studies on bioaerosol deposition in rodent and non-human primate lung
models."

Pathogenic bacteria engage in competition with their hosts for resources. Hosts actively deny resources —
especially transition metals — to invading bacteria to suppress their growth. This is a strategy called nutritional
immunity. Understanding how bacterial populations use metals and how their metal acquisition relates to their
central metabolism is critical to understanding this host-microbe competition and developing new therapeutic
strategies. We currently have a poor understanding both of bacterial metal requirements, and of how bacterial
metal concentrations relate to their central metabolic strategies. The long-term aim of this project is to better
understand the fundamental nature of the relationship between the metal content of individual bacterial cells
within populations of genetically homogenous individuals, and how this relates to variations in their expression
of central metabolism. The first aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the metal concentrations of
individual bacterial cells correlate with their central metabolic strategy. This is likely to be true, since enzymes
involved in central metabolism require metal cofactors, but it has never been demonstrated for individual cells.
To approach this question, we will develop a secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging method
capable of simultaneously tracking metabolism and metal content in hundreds of individual bacterial cells. This
is possible due to recent developments in SIMS that have improved sensitivity and throughput to levels
capable of investigating bacterial populations. This technique is capable of measuring single-cell bacterial
metallomes, while simultaneously measuring abundances of isotope labels that were experimentally provided
to trace central metabolism (stable isotope probing). The second aim of this project is to test the hypothesis
that the phenotypic traits examined in Aim 1 are correlated with patterns of gene expression. Currently
available methods are capable of revealing patterns of gene expression in single bacterial cells using amplified
hybridization techniques coupled to fluorescent reporters. We will modify this technique to use a halogen
reporter that is capable of being visualized by SIMS. The abundance of the halogen tag in single cells can be
measured, correlating targeted patterns of gene expression with single-cell bacterial metallomes and bacterial
metabolism. This is significant because it will help us understand fundamental relationships between resource
abundance and central metabolism, and population strategies for allocating resources and metabolism among
individual bacterial cells."

The goal of this project is to meet the evolving needs of NIH and other research at the Medical University of
South Carolina (MUSC), maintain a pathogen-free animal research environment, and maintain full accreditation
from AAALAC International and full compliance with NIH/OLAW, USDA and other regulatory agencies. This
project will benefit a diverse group of 31 basic and translational investigators who actively use rodent models of
human disease housed in the designated facility to conduct research in neurosciences, substance abuse,
cancer, metabolomics, regenerative medicine, and biomarker development. The Division of Laboratory Animal
Resources (DLAR) is responsible for providing all laboratory animal services and support for the 6 colleges at
MUSC. We support the research needs of 164 unique investigators on campus using animal models. The
Thurmond-Gazes facility was built in 1996 and was fitted with animal housing and caging in 1997, which are now
obsolete. Limitations to our current facility include its small rooms, which only fit 2-3 free standing racks each.
The free-standing racks and associated microisolators are obsolete. Upgrading the caging with associated
integration of remote monitoring of cage microenvironment would increase housing capacity. To further support
this new caging system, the facility plans to upgrade the plumbing for auto watering. This will permit us to
decrease cage change frequency to every other week and will eliminate the need for changing water bottles.
This will result in decreased costs for labor, decreased risk of allergen exposures, repetitive motion, and
ergonomic injury of personnel. Currently, there is no room for change stations to protect personnel from dander
or potential exposures to the animals with the current configuration. With the smaller footprint of the vent racks,
in the future we will be able to add change stations to decrease the exposure of our personnel to animal allergens
which will align this facility to present-day OSHA best practices. Methodologies are also advancing the need for
more animals in a limited space. We currently use cutting-edge or “emerging” approaches to study complex
rodent behaviors using models for studying substance use disorders and neuropsychiatric conditions. Much of
this work relies upon behavioral work in both mice and rats. which, when single housed require substantial
housing space. With new caging systems, we can increase our housing in these rooms by 50-100 percent,
depending on the room. Increased capacity is critically needed to support rapid, ongoing growth in
neurosciences, substance abuse, and other biobehavioral and biomedical research at MUSC that rely on rodent
models of human disease. Support is requested to facilitate research productivity, efficiency, and collaboration
among NIH-funded investigators by increasing housing capabilities and increasing personnel safety and the
repeatability of research."
10993831,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Clostridioides difficile is among the most common causes of nosocomial infections with disease ranging from
antibiotic-associated diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. Secreted toxins are largely responsible for
disease development, yet many aspects of C. difficile physiology and virulence remain poorly understood.
Recent work has revealed that C. difficile produces two colony morphotypes—a rough colony variant and a
smooth colony variant—and can reversibly switch them. This phenomenon is conserved among diverse C.
difficile strains. The two morphological variants differ in several ways. Bacteria from rough colonies are longer
and often found in chains, exhibit greater surface motility and diminished swimming motility, produce less
biofilm biomass, and show greater pathogenicity in animal models compared to the smooth colony counterpart.
Our prior work linked colony morphology and the correlated phenotypes to the expression of genes encoding a
signal transduction system, CmrRST, but the molecular mechanisms by which C. difficile develops rough and
smooth colony morphologies have yet to be defined. The objective of this study is to identify genes required
for formation of each colony morphotype and to determine the roles of these genes in cell morphology, motility,
biofilm formation, and virulence. In Aim 1, we propose three complementary yet independent mutagenesis and
screening strategies to identify genes required for rough and smooth colony development. This work takes
advantage of mutants designed to yield only one colony morphotype. The in vitro phenotypes of the mutants
obtained through the genetic screens will be evaluated to determine the broader impact of the identified genes
on C. difficile physiology and virulence traits. In Aim 2, we will examine how one identified mutation results in
strictly rough colonies and assess its ability to colonize and cause disease in a mouse model of C. difficile
infection. Similar strategies will be used to characterize additional mutants obtained in Aim 1. Pilot studies with
the proposed approaches have identified multiple candidate genes predicted to affect cell division. As such,
these gene products may serve as new targets for therapeutic development, yet almost none of these genes
have been previously studied. The proposed research will identify factors contributing to disease relevant
phenotypes including cell division proteins, facilitating efforts to combat C. difficile infection."

Olfaction provides animals with information about resource quality, conspecific identity, and environmental
conditions. Most mammals use strong, fast, nasal inhalations, or sniffs, to mix odorants and draw them across
the olfactory epithelium in the nose. Rapid sniffing bouts enable active sensing of odorants, providing many
spatiotemporally localized samples per second. These bouts are highly dynamic, beginning and ending within
single breaths, and, in mice, they can extend for minutes at a time. Sniffing, like all modes of breathing, is
controlled by intrinsically oscillating circuitry in the ventral medulla, which receives top-down excitatory, inhibitory,
and modulatory inputs. Despite the importance of dynamically controlling breathing and sniffing behaviors, it
remains unknown how these inputs to the medulla are integrated to shape a fluid behavioral output. One of the
input nuclei, the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), is well-known for its role in modulating respiration in response to
acute threats like high CO2 and pain, as well as for its role in opioid-mediated breathing suppression. Additionally,
it was recently shown that PBN stimulation modulates breathing in awake mice, and that tonic activity in PBN is
important for the maintenance of baseline breathing. However, beyond that, it remains unclear how PBN’s activity
might relate to the volitional control of breathing patterns, such as those underlying sniffing. We have leveraged
our lab’s experience recording dopamine signaling in freely behaving mice to develop a similar setup capable of
monitoring breathing and PBN neural activity. In preliminary experiments, I observed that PBN activity is
correlated with sniffing behaviors, and that silencing PBN outputs can affect the expression of sniffing behaviors.
Based on this evidence, I hypothesize that, rather than responding solely to interoceptive threats to
modulate breathing, PBN integrates and transmits signals related to the volitional control of breathing,
including sniffing. In Aim 1, I will test this hypothesis by modeling the relationship between PBN neural activity
and breathing, and by testing the necessity of PBN signaling for sniffing behaviors. Then, in Aim 2, I will
characterize the anatomical and functional roles of inputs to distinct PBN subpopulations that appear to play
different roles in controlling breathing. Together, these experiments will characterize a novel aspect of PBN
signaling, taking into account moment-to-moment neural activity, rather than relying on experimenter-delivered
stimuli. Further, by characterizing PBN’s relationship to sniffing, they will begin to establish an understanding of
the neural circuitry which controls active olfactory sampling."

The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which Insulin Receptor Substrate 2 (IRS2)
regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and to use this information to study novel therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The IRS proteins are essential adaptor
proteins of the insulin (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1R) receptors. Dysregulation of this pathway
through upregulation of receptors and ligands drives breast cancer initiation, growth and metastasis.
Unfortunately, interfering with the IIS pathway for the treatment of breast cancer by receptor/ligand-targeted
approaches has been unsuccessful, and efforts to improve the ability to target the IIS pathway for cancer therapy
are hindered by the fact that the mechanism(s) by which this signaling pathway contributes to cancer progression
are not well established. This proposal focuses on IRS2 because this adaptor protein is expressed preferentially
in TNBC, and the applicant has compelling data that IRS2 plays a causal role in the aggressive nature of this
breast cancer subtype. Understanding the mechanisms of action of IRS2 in TNBC is essential for exploiting IRS2
as a therapeutic target. In this regard, intriguing recent evidence from the applicant’s lab and other labs has
emerged that implicates IRS2 in mitotic regulation. Specifically, IRS2 expression increases during mitosis, and
it is required for cell cycle arrest at the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a process that ensures precise
chromosomal segregation to maintain genome integrity. Importantly, no studies to date have established the
mechanistic role of IRS2 in SAC regulation. Toward this goal, the applicant has identified the cell cycle regulatory
kinase PLK1, which controls the SAC, as an IRS2-specific interacting protein. Together, these findings reveal a
potential IRS2-dependent vulnerability that could be exploited therapeutically, a possibility that is supported by
the applicant’s preliminary data that loss of IRS2 expression sensitizes TNBC to mitotic stress drugs. To
investigate the hypothesis that IRS2 regulation of the SAC sustains TNBC viability and that targeting this function
of IRS2 will inhibit tumor growth at both primary and metastatic sites, the applicant will: 1) Investigate the role of
IRS2 in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) regulation. The hypothesis that IRS2 expression and localization
are essential for efficient mitotic SAC activation will be examined; 2) Establish the molecular mechanisms by
which IRS2 regulates the mitotic SAC. The hypothesis that IRS2 promotes the fidelity of spindle formation
through the recruitment and activation of PLK1 will be examined; 3) Assess the therapeutic efficacy of targeting
IRS2-dependent cell cycle functions in TNBC. The hypothesis that acute targeting of IRS2 expression and/or its
cell-cycle regulatory functions will sensitize TNBC to mitotic stress will be examined."

 Many studies utilize resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) metrics, such as
functional connectivity (FC), to study the neural underpinnings of autism and identify functional brain networks
related to autistic behaviors. However, these findings remain inconsistent, with reports of underconnectivity and
overconnectivity in multiple resting-state networks. FC measures the temporal correlation between the blood
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of distinct brain regions. In fMRI, the BOLD signal indirectly measures
neuronal activity by detecting changes in oxygenated blood flow, which occurs through local blood vessel
dilation. In addition to neuronal activity, changes in brain vascular function can affect local oxygenated blood
flow, and thus the BOLD signal within a region and FC between regions. Characterizing these cerebrovascular
effects on FC is critical to understanding neuronal and vascular sources of connectivity in populations with
potential cerebrovascular heterogeneity, such autism or early development. In this study, we utilize a novel, non-
invasive method to characterize cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), the vasodilatory capacity of cerebral blood
vessels, in autistic and non-autistic children, based solely on rsfMRI BOLD signals (Aim 1). We then use this
novel information to investigate the mechanism linking vascular function to FC, using the amplitude of low
frequency fluctuations (ALFF), a resting-state measure of local BOLD amplitude that has been associated with
both neuronal and vascular physiology (Aim 2). Using data from the Autism Phenome Project (APP), a
longitudinal neuroimaging program that specializes in early age scanning (2-12 years old) in autistic and non-
autistic children, we will compare age-trajectories of CVR and its effect on FC in autistic and non-autistic children
starting from 2 years old. In acquiring and analyzing data from young autistic and non-autistic participants, I will
receive unique clinical and neuroimaging training, specifically in autism, to support my career as an independent
investigator, developing novel neuroimaging biomarkers to characterize cerebral physiology in autism.
Ultimately, providing insight into cerebrovascular differences and enhancing FC interpretations in autism, starting
from early age, will help disentangle its heterogeneity to inform meaningful, early interventions."

 Recently, new macromolecular systems have been discovered which marries the benefits of both CRISPR
and TNP systems and shows tremendous promise as programmable DNA-insertion tools for genome-editing,
complementing the power of tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. This proposal aims to uncover the molecular
mechanisms governing two as-yet poorly understood phenomena in CRISPR-Transposase (CRISPR-TNP)
systems: target-site immunity and programmed-DNA insertion. The central protein thought to be responsible for
both of these observed behaviors in the multi-component shCAST system is shTnsC. We propose to utilize high-
resolution cryo-EM to determine the structure of DNA-bound shTnsC. In addition, shTnsC is a AAA+ ATPase
whose nucleotide-hydrolysis activity is linked to transposition. We propose to determine the structure of shTnsC
in different nucleotide-bound states in order to reveal the role of ATP-hydrolysis in transposition. Finally, we aim
to uncover the mechanisms governing shTnsC recruitment to the target-site via Cas12k and shTniQ, and how
the association between these factors ultimately initiates shCAST transposition. Our strong preliminary data
indicates that these aims are likely to be successful. In addition, the Kellogg lab is well-supported within the

time of hospitalization. Our previous research has increased our understanding of the multitude of SDOH
impacting readmission risk and poor outcomes. With NIDDK funding, we developed a measurement system
(REDD-CAT) designed to efficiently capture and create a personalized profile of health-related social needs for
patients with diabetes to reduce avoidable hospitalization and emergency department visits. We now aim to
study a novel intervention that couples our innovative SDOH screening intervention tool (REDD-CAT) with an
evidence-based patient navigation protocol (REDDCAT2) also developed in past NIH-funded work. We will
implement this intervention during hospital care transitions in order to leverage hospitalization as an
opportunity to resolve unmet SDOH needs for people living with diabetes. We will study the impact of the
REDDCAT2 intervention compared with discharge care as usual readmission risk measured as time to
rehospitalization in the 90 days following discharge. The goal of the comparative effectiveness trial is to assess
the impact of REDD-CAT on medical service outcome, diabetes outcomes and SDOH outcomes at 30-days
and 90-days following hospital discharge. The REDD-CAT tool will rapidly identify individuals with unmet social
needs that place them at risk of poor health outcomes. The REDDCAT2 patient navigator will work with the
patient to collaboratively prioritize each individual patient’s SDOH needs at the hospital bedside and provide
post-discharge PN support for 90-days care transition period to resolve unmet SDOH needs. We will also use
this research opportunity to generate a unique patient risk profile algorithm for future work."

Over 100 million adults in the U.S. suffer from intermittent or constant chronic pain, and chronic pain affects at
least 10% of the world’s population. The primary pharmaceuticals for treatment of chronic pain have been
natural or synthetic opioids and the use of opioids for pain treatment has resulted in what has been called an
“epidemic” of opioid abuse, addiction and lethal overdoses. We have, through a process of rational drug
design, generated a new chemical entity (NCE) and have given it the name Kindolor. Kindolor is a non-opiate,
non-addicting molecule that was developed specifically to simultaneously control the aberrant activity of three
targets on the peripheral sensory system that are integral in the development and propagation of chronic pain.
Kindolor acts as an inhibitor of the pain propagating Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels and as an inhibitor of
NMDA receptors that act to magnify pain signals (Fig A). We have generated a process to synthesize Kindolor
at 99% purity. In our pre-clinical studies, we have demonstrated the efficacy of Kindolor to reduce or eliminate
chronic pain generated in five animal models at doses compatible with use of Kindolor in humans. We have
generated evidence that this broad range of efficacy is a result of the multi-target engagement by Kindolor. We
have generated the initial evidence for the safety (high TI) of Kindolor and its uneventful metabolism. Additional
attractive features of Kindolor are that it can prevent the development of chronic pain if given soon after tissue
injury. And if combined with low doses of opiates, Kindolor produces a substantial “opiate sparing” effect
through synergistic actions with the opiates. To bring Kindolor to the public, we are proposing to complete the
pre-clinical studies necessary for an IND application to the FDA and, if the IND is approved, the completion of
a Phase 1a and 1b, first in human, study of the safety of our compound, and then a Phase 2a study of efficacy
on pain of osteoarthritis. To start, we will have Kindolor synthesized using cGMP procedures. This will include
development of methods for scaling up production quantities. We will produce a formulation for oral drug
administration to humans and will use this formulation for GLP studies of pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics
in two species of animals (rat and minipig). We will complete GLP studies of safety of the formulation in the two
species, including escalating dose experiments and sub-chronic dosing for 28 days with low, moderate, and
high doses of the drug product. These studies will include a 14-day recovery period to assess delayed toxicity.
Genotoxicity studies will also be completed, as will specific assessments of cardiovascular and respiratory
toxicity prior to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. The satisfactory completion of the pre-IND meeting will allow
for expedient completion of the IND application. Given approval of the IND application, we propose to complete
the Phase Ia and 1b study and the Phase 2a study. In all, our goal is to bring our compound to a full Phase 2
ready stage for licensing or partnering with a Pharma company willing and able to bring the medication to the
chronic pain sufferer.
Abstract: Supplement to UH3DA047680 (project period 7/01/21 to 6/30/24)
Major accomplishments of the UH3 project to date include the completion of nonclinical toxicology
studies, the formulation of kindolor tosylate enteric-coated tablets, and submission of an IND
application for Phase 1a clinical trial in August 2022. The FDA placed a Full Clinical Hold on the
clinical trial in October 2022, requiring further studies. These studies were completed and a response
to the clinical hold was submitted in September 2023. The clinical hold was removed in October 2023.
Because of the delay associated with the Clinical Hold, and because of modification of the clinical trial
protocol requested by the FDA, the budget for the Phase 1 trial has increased from the budget that
was included with the UH3 application (March 2021). This supplement is requested in order to
provide the funding needed to perform the approved phase 1a clinical trial."

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD Related Dementias (ADRD) continue to present serious challenges in the aging
population and there is a significant need to identify and reduce risk factors. A well-recognized and promising
approach to reducing AD/ADRD comprises reduction of vascular injury often found to occur concomitantly with AD
pathology. Less appreciated facets of this disease include large systemic changes in physiology, including
alterations in the gut microbiome that occur with age and disease. Recent studies from our group and others
suggest that gut microbes play a key role in shaping vascular biology and AD pathology. Gut microbes influence
the host in part through production of metabolites that act on specific receptors expressed in distant organs,
impacting multiple cellular signaling cascades, including inflammation, thrombosis, and cellular senescence. Our
research group has recently identified associations between plasma levels of the gut microbiome-derived
metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) and increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL),
a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Increased ImP was also detected at higher levels in individuals with accelerated
decline in performance on tests of executive function. Furthermore, we discovered that ImP impairs endothelial
cell function and disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Validating these associations and
establishing causal and mechanistic links with AD-pathology will have significant translational impact as there is a
toolkit at our disposal to change the gut microbiome, including dietary changes, fecal transplants, and small
molecule inhibitors targeting the bacterial ImP production pathway, which is not present in the host. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that ImP modulates AD and ADRD progression by altering vascular
endothelial function and BBB permeability. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize the relationship
between ImP, BBB disruption, and AD pathology in conventional and gnotobiotic mouse models of disease. We
will also leverage existing samples and data collected among participants in the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center to determine the extent to which ImP is associated with fluid AD biomarkers and vascular injury
as measured by MRI. The examination of the microbiome as a critical component that shapes AD/ADRD pathology
through its effects on vascular function represents a novel perspective that we are uniquely positioned to examine."

Glaucoma is a progressive disease of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Some evidence suggests
that oral SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which increase serotonin (5-HT) levels, may have a
protective effect against progression of open angle glaucoma. To understand the mechanism of this potential
protection, we assessed RGC expression of serotonin receptors (HTRs) in mouse and human scRNA-seq
datasets. In mice, Htr1b is expressed in RGCs at a high level and preferentially expressed in alpha RGCs
(αRGCs). In humans, HTR1B is expressed in RGCs, suggesting a conserved function. In mouse retinal tissue,
we detected Htr1b transcript in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and HTR1B protein in the GCL and inner plexiform
layer near excitatory post-synaptic sites. Using electroretinogram (ERG), optokinetic response (OKR), and
multielectrode array (MEA) testing in conjunction with histology in Htr1b-/- and control mice, we found that Htr1b-/-
retinas are anatomically normal, but Htr1b is required for several aspects of normal inner retinal function. We
also found that HTR1B agonists and antagonists impact ON and OFF RGCs differently. Finally, SSRI
administration in drinking water mitigated some IOP-induced phenotypes without reducing IOP. These data
suggest that 5-HT and HTRs play a previously unrecognized role in RGC function and IOP/glaucoma
susceptibility. We will test the hypothesis that Htr1b is required for normal RGC and αRGC function and acts
through downstream effects on membrane excitability. We will also ask if increased 5-HT signaling through Htr1b
promotes RGC resistance to injury whereas decreased 5-HT signaling through Htr1b increases RGC
susceptibility in the setting of elevated IOP. There are three aims: (1) Determine the cell-type specific function of
Htr1b in the inner retina; (2) Elucidate the intracellular mechanisms of action of Htr1b in four αRGC subtypes;
and (3) Assess the impact of altered 5-HT signaling on glaucoma susceptibility. In Aim 1, we will combine a novel
conditional Htr1b knockout with Cre-expressing lines specific for RGCs, αRGCs, or amacrine cells to dissect
Htr1b function at the retinal circuitry level (ERG/MEA), behavioral level (OKR), and brain circuitry level (mapping
of RGC axon transport to the superior colliculus). We will also use a novel system of adult mouse RGC isolation
and culture to test cell-autonomous anatomic responses to 5-HT. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacologic techniques
alongside whole-cell patch clamp recording to compare 5-HT and Htr1b biology among the four αRGC subtypes
and to test the hypothesis that HTR1B acts via regulation of potassium channels. We will also use fibronectin
intrabodies generated with mRNA display to map HTR1B to excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic sites. In Aim
3, we will provide SSRI in the drinking water of mice with elevated IOP and use both physiologic and anatomic
studies to determine if increased 5-HT causes RGC neuroprotection. We will then determine if concurrent Htr1b
loss of function or overexpression prevents or enhances neuroprotection, respectively."

 Host-symbiont interactions represent an enormous variety of relationships with an extraordinary array of
resulting phenotypes. Microbial symbionts of arthropods have a particularly wide range of symbiotic interactions
with their hosts. One exceptional case is that of Wolbachia bacterial symbionts that are found in almost half of
all arthropod species. These microbes are genetically and phenotypically highly diverse, and various strains
have abilities ranging from manipulation of host reproduction to provision of essential host nutrients. One unique
and highly consequential feature of some Wolbachia strains is the ability to inhibit transmission of viruses
including Zika and dengue from arthropods to humans. Several global initiatives have taken advantage of this
ability to use Wolbachia to successfully fight arthropod-borne disease. However, the mechanism of pathogen-
blocking is unclear, as is the breadth of the phenotype in terms of affected pathogens. This limits the ability to
predict the success of current vector control field trials and to identify and develop new applications of the
phenotype. Preliminary data shows that Wolbachia pathogen inhibition extends to diverse fungi as well, since
Wolbachia-positive Drosophila melanogaster flies live longer after systemic infection with a variety of fungal
pathogens. It also suggests host immune priming may underlie the mechanism. This proposal outlines a set of
organismal, genetic, and molecular approaches to build a comprehensive profile of Wolbachia-fungal interactions
in Dipteran hosts. This proposal will primarily use the elite genetic model, Drosophila melanogaster, with the
wMel Wolbachia strain, the same strain that is utilized in antiviral initiatives. Aim 1 will functionally assess the
role of host immune priming in the mechanism, focusing on specific genes of interest in the Toll and JAK/STAT
pathways, using genetic and transcriptomic approaches. In Aim 2, trans-infections, feeding assays, and
metabolomics will be used to assess the role of Wolbachia factors, nutritional competition, and fungal metabolite
inhibition in the phenotype. Aim 3 will test translational potential by assessing fungal protection in Aedes
mosquitoes, inhibition of inter-individual fungal transmission, and the population benefits of fungal protection in
cage populations. This approach leverages many powerful approaches and techniques to provide an extensive
characterization of Wolbachia-fungal interactions. Doing so will provide insight into Wolbachia pathogen blocking
mechanisms, the basic biology of interkingdom microbial interactions, and potentially inform and bolster vector
control initiatives. With guidance from Advisory Committee members Drs. Ackley, Oakley, and Michel and
sponsor Dr. Unckless at the University of Kansas, this proposal encompasses a comprehensive plan with all of
the training needed for Dr. Perlmutter to achieve the career goal of becoming an independent investigator
studying the genetics and mechanisms of host-symbiont interactions with a main focus on arthropods."
10983660,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder associated with social anxiety,
hypersensitivity to stimuli, seizures, and learning disabilities. It is classically viewed as a monogenic disease in
which mutation-length expansion of a CGG short tandem repeat (STR) tract above a critical mutation-length
threshold of 200 triplets leads to local DNA methylation and repression of FMR1. Genome-wide gene expression
changes are thought to occur downstream of the loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP)
encoded by FMR1. In our lab’s new data acquired during the previous funding period, we used nanopore long-
read sequencing, Hi-C, CUT&RUN, CRISPR STR engineering, and single-cell Oligopaint imaging to find
Megabase (Mb)-sized H3K9me3 domains on autosomes and the X-chromosome in FXS patient-derived cell
lines and brain tissue. Domains co-localize with severe misfolding of topologically associating domains (TADs)
and loops and connect via trans interactions in subnuclear hubs. Because H3K9me3 domains encompass STRs
susceptible to instability and replication stress-induced double strand breaks, we termed them BREACHes:
Beacons of Repeat Expansion Anchored by Contacting Heterochromatin. BREACHes encompass and silence
genes encoding synaptic plasticity, epithelial integrity, reproductive development, and neural cell adhesion,
which are clinical hallmarks in FXS. Thus, by way of Mb-scale heterochromatin domains and trans interactions,
we find multiple plausible candidate genes of possible relevance for understanding onset, progression or
therapeutic treatment of FXS. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the RNA-mediated and higher-order
folding mechanisms governing heterochromatin domains and the trans interactions among them in FXS. Our
central hypothesis is that mutation-length CGG STR-containing RNA forms RNA:DNA hybrid structures to
establish H3K9me3 domains, whereas the attenuation of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is necessary to
maintain H3K9me3 and trans interactions. We will test our hypothesis with two Specific Aims. First, we will
investigate the role for CGG STR-containing RNA in BREACH establishment. To model the removal of H3K9me3
signal and the subsequent re-establishment of the domains, we will reprogram normal-length, FXS mutation-
length, and premutation-length cutback induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from primed to naïve pluripotency
and release back to primed. In a timecourse of BREACH re-establishment, we will assay R loops, RNA-chromatin
interactions, histone methyl transferases, and 3D genome folding. Second, we will elucidate the effect of cohesin-
mediated loop extrusion on BREACH maintenance in single cells. We will deplete and replete the cohesin
unloading factor WAPL in FXS iPSCs. In a timecourse of recovery and loss of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion,
we will assay genome folding, DNA methylation, and H3K9me3 with cutting edge single-cell genomics and
imaging technologies. Together, these studies will shed light on the mechanisms governing the establishment
and maintenance of H3K9me3 domains and the inter-chromosomal interactions among them in FXS."

The gut microbiome (GM) strongly influences human health, playing critical roles in immune priming, nutrient
metabolism, and pathogen exclusion. During infant and child development, the GM undergoes a systematic
turnover of species until reaching an adult-like state. The equilibrium of the gut ecosystem can be disrupted by
perturbations, such as antibiotic usage and inflammatory exposures, causing significant decreases in microbial
diversity and aberrant physiological processes, sometimes with lifelong implications. However, the mechanisms
underlying the resilience of the GM to shifts or perturbations are not well understood. The gut virome is dominated
by bacteriophages (phages), which play crucial roles in shaping bacterial communities through predation and
horizontal gene transfer. Viruses can also directly interact with human cells to influence gut physiology. Herein,
we hypothesize that altered viral communities are both symptoms of and contributors to human disease, as
gastrointestinal perturbations drive phage induction and subsequent virus-bacteria and virus-human interactions
which impact human health. Accordingly, we propose to study virus-bacteria-human dynamics during antibiotic
exposure and inflammatory diseases, leveraging over 70,000 banked patient stools from four cohorts with well-
curated clinical metadata. The rationale implicating a functional role for viruses in human gut health is that
changes in the abundance of specific viruses targeting certain bacterial populations are frequently observed in
perturbed GM states. These include antibiotic exposure and intestinal inflammatory conditions for which there is
no clear bacterial etiological agent, such as inflammatory bowel disease in adults and necrotizing enterocolitis
in preterm infants. Our central motivation is to provide a comprehensive analysis of human gut ecology during
dramatic GM shift events that are consistently correlated with virome alterations. Understanding these alterations
is critical for the design of virus-related diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to improve inflammatory disease
outcomes and antibiotic-triggered GM imbalance. This will be achieved through two aims to: I) Define the
interactions between viruses, bacteria, and human cells contributing to perturbation-associated shift events, and
II) Determine the effects of host-associated perturbations on gut viruses and their contributions to the
inflammatory responses in mammalian cells and GM-humanized mouse models. Our analyses are significant as
they provide a systematic investigation of the relationship between GM perturbations and virome alterations in
adult and pediatric populations. Our proposal is innovative in leveraging novel complementary technologies
including high-resolution genomics, viral tagging of bacterial and human cells, and GM-humanized gnotobiotic
mouse models to identify viral drivers of clinical outcomes. Our proposal is impactful in its goal to address basic,
translational, and clinically relevant questions in functional virus-bacterial-human interactions related to human
health and disease."

This proposal is to modernize the C.W. Steers Biological Resources Center (BRC) to meet its growing
sterilizing needs by purchasing a new efficient sterilizer with a water conservation vacuum system. This
autoclave will increase reliable sterilization of animal- and biomedical-related research tools/materials.
In November of 2020, the Preclinical Research Center (PRC) was opened for the housing of rodents at the
BRC. Its modern design increased the Lundquist Institute’s rodent housing capacity from 1,000 mice cages to
6,000 (with space for 1,000 cages dedicated for genetically modified immunosuppressed rodents). As the
pandemic slowed, research ramped; in the last six months, cages in use grew from 400 to 1,000. Additional
projected growth is expected: grant awards with upcoming start dates will more than double the current
population cage use to 2,500 within the year. With this growth, the demand for autoclaved cages to provide
appropriate housing for susceptible animals has also increased. Autoclaves are indispensable in animal
research for preventing disease from spreading within the rodents. Two areas of research will be supported by
a new modernized efficient autoclave: (1) The infectious disease department, whose studies require sterile
caging at all times (30,848 rodents); and (2) Studies requiring other immunosuppressed rodents (16,694), such
as transgenic mice used for studies focused on chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, Mucopolysaccharidosis
Type III, etc.). Immunosuppressed mice used for chronic diseases studies are kept in the Immunosuppressed
Housing Area, which grew from one room with capacity for 100 cages to two rooms with capacity for 1,000
cages with the move to PRC. While the BRC’s current autoclave (2000 Steris AMSCO Eagle SV-3043
scientific prevacuum sterilizer is well-maintained, it is being used at capacity. Due to the increase in the
number of cages needing sterilization at one time, an additional autoclave is needed to triple the BRC’s
capacity to sterilize cages with a faster cycle of 45-60 minutes. Therefore, our request is to fund the purchase
of a new efficient sterilizer with a water conservation vacuum system to allow for reliable sterilization to meet
the new and growing needs of infectious disease and immunosuppressed rodent studies, ensuring efficient
workflows for both in-house and CRO-contracted investigators. This purchase will supplement the capacity of
the current older autoclave by tripling the number of daily loads from two to six. The purchase of the state-of-
the-art autoclave will allow for the following aims:
Aim 1: Support high-quality animal research in the areas of infectious and chronic disease.
Aim 2: Modernize the facility by enabling advancement in operations and improving efficiencies.
Aim 3: Implement green technology."

Older adults are at risk for developing swallowing disorders (dysphagia) due to advancing age coupled with
complicating comorbid diseases. Dysphagia is defined as altered swallow safety (aspiration) and/or efficiency
(residue) and, if undetected and unmonitored, consequences include compromised health status (aspiration
pneumonia, choking) and affected quality of life. Radiologic imaging (videofluoroscopy) is the most
comprehensive and well-studied modality for evaluation. However, clinicians treating patients in non-hospital
settings do not have ready access to this instrumentation. While less comprehensive, ultrasound imaging has
been proposed as a bedside solution that would allow clinicians to monitor specific changes in swallowing
physiology, conduct therapy, and provide evidence for appropriate referral for videofluoroscopic assessment.
However, there is a lack of evidence regarding congruence between ultrasound and videofluoroscopic measures
of swallowing biomechanics (criterion validity) and whether ultrasound can detect clinically salient features of
swallowing. Further, ultrasound imaging for swallowing biofeedback has not been tested in people with
dysphagia. These limitations have prevented clinical translation of this tool. We propose to: (Aim 1) validate
ultrasound measures of oropharyngeal movements vs simultaneous MBSS and determine how these measures
relate to clinical metrics of swallowing function (Modified Barium Swallowing Impairment Profile [MBSImP]
Scoring; Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Kinematics, Events, and Timing [ASPEKT]); (Aim 2) determine
whether ultrasound biofeedback improves execution of therapeutic swallowing maneuvers in persons with
dysphagia. For Aim 1, we will recruit older individuals (≥60 years, N=70) with neurogenic (e.g. cerebrovascular
accident [CVA]) and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s Disease/Alzheimer’s Disease Related
Dementias [ADRD]) who are referred for a MBSS in our standard-of-care clinic. During MBSS, we will collect
simultaneous ultrasound imaging with the probe placed in various sagittal, coronal, and transverse positions
along the neck to capture lingual, pharyngeal, hyoid, vocal fold, and bolus movements. For both modalities, time-
dependent movements of oropharyngeal structures including displacements, velocities, and relative timing will
be measured. Ultrasound measurements will be validated vs measurements from MBSS imaging and evaluated
relative to clinical metrics of swallowing physiology using MBSImP scoring and ASPEKT. For Aim 2, a subset of
participants (N=44) will be randomly sampled to test whether real-time ultrasound biofeedback improves
performance of therapeutic maneuvers for patients with dysphagia. We will compare ultrasound measurements
of maneuvers completed with and without visual ultrasound biofeedback. This project will lay the groundwork for
future investigations on ultrasound as a point-of-care tool to transform dysphagia diagnosis, monitoring and
treatment at the bedside and in non-hospital settings."

Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) is an evidence-based harm-reduction
approach developed in the early 1990’s to address problematic alcohol use among college students. Since then,
there has been a proliferation of trials supporting its efficacy and effectiveness in diverse college populations
and it has become the basis for the majority of current brief motivational interventions with individual-focused
strategies shown to reduce high-risk drinking behavior and/or negative drinking-related consequences. Despite
this, several challenges and research gaps remain in our understanding of potential barriers faced by college
campuses that are currently implementing BASICS. Additionally, it is unclear whether most schools are delivering
BASICS with adherence to its main components and principles or whether adaptations to the intervention are
routinely applied due to feasibility considerations1. The proposed research aims to use a mixed methods
approach to identify factors influencing implementation outlined by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,
Sustainment (EPIS)2 framework and the implementation outcomes acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility
outlined by the Implementation Outcomes Framework3. Recently, the International Town and Gown Association
(ITGA) financed the implementation of BASICS training with 52+ campuses across the United States, which
consists of an intensive brief training model as well as providing technical assistance from BASICS experts
based out of the University of Washington. Leveraging this large-scale implementation, the proposed F31 study
will examine which factors influence successful integration of BASICS within diverse campus environments. This
training grant will also allow the applicant to develop a depth and breadth of knowledge of BASICS and related
evidence based AOD interventions as well as expand and deepen knowledge of implementation science theory,
mixed-methods data collection, evaluation, and analysis methodology. Data collection through surveys and
interviews will allow for a comprehensive understanding of contextual factors that impact implementation of
BASICS. Additionally, the proposed research will identify descriptive characteristics of BASICS implementers
and universities to better understand circumstances under which the intended mode of delivery of the
intervention is likely to be adapted or adhered to. Findings will contribute to the existing literature on brief
interventions for alcohol use on college campuses, offering insights into the complexities of large-scale
implementation efforts. Knowledge generated by this research will inform future efforts to optimize integration of
BASICS and similar programs, ultimately promoting better public health outcomes and improved student well-
being at universities nationwide."
10996792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the biggest challenges facing the tuberculosis field is the heterogeneity of TB disease presentation. Only
a small percentage of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis go on to develop an acute infection.
While several important tuberculosis co-morbidities have been identified (i.e. HIV co-infection, smoking, malnu-
trition, diabetes), we are still unable to accurately predict whether a tuberculosis patient is at high risk for devel-
oping severe disease. For decades, we have understood that the way in which Mtb-infected macrophages die
plays a key role in dictating Mtb outcomes in vivo. Apoptosis, an “immunologically silent” form of cell death is
generally considered anti-bacterial; apoptosis limits bacterial spread and does not release high amounts of im-
munogenic DAMPs and PAMPs. Necrosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, promotes Mtb survival and spread
and elicits harmful immunopathology. One would predict that a tuberculosis patient with macrophages that
are prone to necrosis would be likely to experience severe inflammation in response to Mtb infection.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that a common human SNP in a mitochondrial-associated gene called LRRK2
promotes a new hyperinflammatory type of necrosis in response to Mtb infection. This cell death was dubbed
gasdermin D-mediated necroptosis, as it requires the pore forming protein gasdermin D and results in activa-
tion of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and cell death via necroptosis. This mutation (Lrrk2G2019S) promotes excessive mito-
chondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and mtROS alone is sufficient to promote gasdermin D-
mediated necroptosis. Building on these findings, this proposal will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress drive Mtb-infected macrophages to undergo inflammatory forms of cell
death and constitute a new, important “co-morbidity” for tuberculosis patients. The goal of this proposal
is to mechanistically define how oxidative stress promotes pathogenic cell death modalities during Mtb infection
of macrophages and mice. Here, two models of high mtROS will be leveraged (exogenous mtROS via menadi-
one treatment and the human disease-associated SNP Lrrk2G2019S) to mechanistically define how oxidative stress
can repurpose cell death proteins in primary murine macrophages. Aim 1 will investigate the ability of LRRK2
kinase activity to directly activate necroptosome proteins and promote gasdermin D-mediated necroptosis. Aim
2 will define how various cellular stresses license N-GSDMD association with mitochondrial phospholipids to
promote gasdermin D-mediated necroptosis. Aim 3 will examine the role of lipid oxidation in dictating cell death
modality usage during Mtb infection. If successful, this proposal will define the cellular triggers of hyperinflam-
matory cell death during Mtb infection of macrophages and identify novel points for therapeutic intervention that
may be more efficacious to target in TB patients with underlying conditions or genetics linked to mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress."

Macrocyclic peptides are effective scaffolds for cancer drug discovery because they can combine the
metabolic stability and target specificity of biologics with oral bioavailability and membrane permeability of
small molecules. The bicyclic octapeptide moroidin is a promising lead structure for anticancer therapy.
Moroidin is characterized by an N-terminal pyroglutamate and two tryptophan side-chain cross-linkages. Due
to low-yield isolation from source-plant material and synthetic challenges toward macrocyclic complexity and
chirality, an optimized biosynthetic route is needed to diversify and produce moroidin analogs in a heterologous
expression system.
Moroidin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide derived from autocatalytic
Japanese kerria peptide cyclase KjaBURP, which installs the tryptophan-crosslinks to a leucine and a histidine
side chain in a copper-dependent reaction. KjaBURP encodes four moroidin core peptide motifs attached to
the C-terminal catalytic BURP domain. Based on preliminary work, I hypothesize that the second moroidin ring
can be exploited to generate hundreds of analogs with chemopreventative potential. In Specific Aim 1,
metabolic engineering of the moroidin pathway via heterologous expression of moroidin cyclase constructs
such as KjaBURP in Nicotiana benthamiana will maximize biosynthetic access to natural moroidins and its
analogs. Specific Aim 2 seeks to generate a small library of semi-pure moroidin analogs in transgenic tobacco
by engineered KjaBURP, test their cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines, and use various high-throughput
scoring methods to propose a mechanism of action for dose-responsive peptides. The proposed research of
moroidin pathway engineering is an approach to generate and biologically screen new plant peptide libraries
for utility in cancer drug discovery."

The US Environmental Protection Agency recognizes wildfire smoke as a significant source of particulate matter
under 2.5 microns diameter (PM2.5) emissions, which are expected to increase because of climate change. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 200 million people in the United States live in
counties affected by wildfire smoke conditions. Exacerbation of pre-existing respiratory conditions, including
asthma and COPD, is associated with wildfire events. However, there is a paucity of data on whether wildfire
smoke exposure can promote the development of chronic disease. Understanding the human health risks of
wildfires is complicated by highly variable emissions from combined combustion of biomass and anthropogenic
materials at the wildland urban interface. Further, growing epidemiological evidence suggests that particulate
matter source and composition can be associated with more severe health outcomes. There is a compelling
need to understand the toxicology of wildfire smoke exposures for public health, particularly in vulnerable
populations such as young children. The goal of our revised R21 application is to address the significant
knowledge gap by which inhaled wildfire smoke can elicit cellular injury in the respiratory tract of pediatric
populations. We hypothesize that neonatal lung epithelium is more susceptible to inflammation and injury as a
result of wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure. We further propose that wildfire smoke PM2.5 exposure can elicit
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in lung epithelium, progressively leading to restrictive lung disease. Our
hypothesis is based upon preliminary data with evidence of immune dysregulation and restrictive lung disease
in adult rhesus monkeys exposed as infants to the 2008 Northern California Humboldt/Trinity County fires, as
well as altered expression of lung ER stress markers and surfactant protein C (SP-C) in juvenile rhesus monkeys
exposed to the 2018 Northern California Butte County “Camp” fire. We will test our hypothesis using wood smoke
particles as a surrogate for wildfire smoke PM2. in primary cell or organoid lung epithelial cell cultures, followed
by in vivo exposures using a neonatal mouse model. The Specific Aims of this revised R21 application will (1)
Define the contribution of chronologic age on impact of wood smoke particle toxicity in respiratory epithelium; (2)
Define the contribution of chronologic age on impact of wood smoke particle toxicity in alveolar epithelium; and
(3) Investigate the effect of early life wood smoke particle exposure on induction of immune dysregulation and
lung function decrements in the adult lung. To understand how the immune system and respiratory tract can be
functionally and persistently altered by air pollutants, an essential step is to determine the cellular mechanisms
of exposure in vulnerable populations such as young children. Our findings will inform on the unique toxicological
aspects of air pollution exposures resulting from wildfires and lead to development of biomarkers and
preventative measures to limit the adverse health effects of restrictive lung diseases."

New solutions are desperately needed to reduce the annual global burden of dengue. As we have witnessed
for SARS-CoV-2, virus genomics can be harnessed to directly inform public health control measures. However,
for most other pathogens, including dengue virus, the depth of genomic information needed for such
applications is lacking. For dengue virus, part of the issue is its complexity: it is comprised of four genetically
distinct serotypes with many defined genotypes and even more undefined variants. Furthermore, current
surveillance and research programs are not optimized to fully leverage virus genomics. This proposal aims to
bridge this gap by proposing a detailed phylogenetic analysis to uncover critical dengue epidemiological
processes, including the outbreak emergence interval and pattern of spread. Through this initiative, our
understanding of dengue virus diversity, evolution, and epidemiology will significantly advance. The proposed
research, which integrates insights from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014-2016 West African Ebola
outbreak, aims to determine which DENV lineages were integral to past outbreaks and explore the temporal
and geographic factors influencing their persistence. The anticipated outcomes encompass the identification of
DENV lineages responsible for causing outbreaks, estimation of average emergence intervals, and insights
into the factors impacting lineage persistence. These findings can revolutionize DENV disease forecasting and
contribute to the development of genomics-informed control strategies, offering a timely and vital approach to
addressing the escalating challenge of dengue transmission globally."

Our work in the areas of mitochondrial function, energy homeostasis, and metabolomics has led us to discover
a remarkably strong association between adverse cardiometabolic outcomes and elevated blood/tissue levels of
acylcarnitine (AC) conjugates. These metabolites derive from acyl-CoA intermediates of fuel catabolism and
permit mitochondrial export of excess carbons. Most ACs are generated as byproducts in incomplete fatty acid
oxidation (FAO). For the past fifteen years, our investigative team has remained keenly committed to answering a
crucial question: What is this AC signature telling us about the interplay between mitochondrial fitness and
metabolic resilience? Our recent preclinical studies lead us to hypothesize that AC accumulation reflects a
bottleneck in the FAO pathway that diminishes mitochondrial power and efficiency. This prediction stems from
unique insights gained via the application of a new mitochondrial diagnostics platform developed by our team.
In simple terms, our assays serve as an in vitro “stress test” that evaluates how well a given population of
mitochondria, fueled by specific mixtures of carbon substrates, responds to a lipid challenge. These studies
revealed that “mitochondrial lipid tolerance” predicts tissue and whole-body metabolic health. Moreover, by
combining this platform with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics, we uncovered a critical
vulnerability in the mitochondrial FAO pathway that associates with “mitochondrial lipid intolerance” and whole-
body metabolic dysfunction. We also found that mitochondrial “lipid tolerance”–defined as the ability of
mitochondrial to maintain bioenergetic stability in the face of a lipid challenge–strongly correlates with the activity
of a short chain carbon circuit that enables reverse flux of acetyl CoA through medium-chain ketothiolase
(MKT) to regenerate free CoA and oxidized NAD+, both critical co-factors necessary for oxidative metabolism.
We also discovered that reverse SC carbon flux through this circuit depends on an ample supply of acetyl CoA
derived from either pyruvate (in the fed state) or ketones (in the fasted state). Together, these findings lead us
to hypothesize that reverse flux through the SC carbon circuit, supported by pyruvate and/or ketones, plays a
crucial role in conferring whole body metabolic fitness and metabolic resilience. The research plan developed
for the next cycle of this grant aims to determine whether reverse flux through the SC carbon circuit is both
necessary and sufficient to confer mitochondria lipid tolerance, metabolic flexibility, and metabolic adaptations
to exercise training."

 The provision of low-value (quality) care, defined as services for which the potential for harm outweighs
the potential for benefit, is estimated to account for more than $300 billion in health care expenditures annually
and thus has critical consequences for patients and the overall health care system (Koziara 2020). Over the
past decade, initiatives such as the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign and the Less is More series sponsored
by JAMA Internal Medicine have raised awareness of the magnitude of the problem. (Because most published
studies use the term “low-value” we adopt this terminology as equivalent to low-quality). Several studies
constructed indicators of low-value care from claims data; most measures were diagnostic test or imaging
procedures (Schwartz et al. 2014; Mafi et al. 2021; Segal et al. 2014; Colla et al. 2015). Research to date
shows that the CW campaign had little impact on reducing the use of low-value care. Early-stage breast cancer
(BC) is a highly prevalent condition for which several metrics of low-value care have been identified by
oncology and surgical specialty societies. Thus, efforts to reduce the use of these low-value services will likely
yield substantial cost savings. Private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans have a unique toolkit which can be
used to reduce the use of low-value care. For example, MA plans may require prior authorization for high-cost
procedures, provide incentives for beneficiaries to seek care from a network of “high value” providers and
employ financial incentives to influence physicians’ prescribing patterns. In contrast, fee-for-service or
“traditional” Medicare (TM) does not impose such constraints and restrictions on patients’ choice of providers
or procedures deemed to be of low-value. In addition, different types of MA plans (health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs)) face varying financial incentives that are
likely to influence efforts to reduce use of low-value care. Yet, most previous research either compares all MA
plans in aggregate to TM or focuses solely on MA-HMO plans. Comparisons of TM vs MA-PPO plans are
nonexistent. Our aims to examine early-stage BC (stages 0, I, IIA, IIB and IIIA) are:
 Aim 1: To assess differences in receipt of low-value (quality) BC care for women newly diagnosed with
early-stage BC across TM and specific types of MA plans, including TM vs MA-HMO plans and TM vs MA-
PPO plans, after controlling for individuals’ self-selection into a TM, MA-HMO plan, or MA-PPO plan, patient
demographic and clinical characteristics and breast surgeon practice structure.
 Aim 2: To evaluate incremental spending on low-value BC care among women age 70 and older with
early-stage BC enrolled in TM and comparable measures of spending (resource use) among similar women
enrolled in MA-HMO plans and MA-PPO plans, after controlling individuals’ self-selection into a TM, MA-HMO
plan, or MA-PPO plan, patient demographic and clinical characteristics and breast surgeon practice structure."

With Black men and women experiencing a disproportionately high burden of colorectal cancer (CRC), there is
a critical need for new improved risk prediction tools to identify those at highest risk to undergo screening at
earlier ages or more frequently as needed. Black adults have the highest incidence and mortality rates of any
racial and ethnic group in the US for reasons only partly understood and their risk factors have not been well-
studied to date. Further, Black Americans experience persistently high rates of early-onset CRC diagnosed in
younger adults aged less than 50 years. Early-onset CRC is an emerging public health concern due to rising
incidence rates, leading to a recently reduced routine screening age of 45 years in the US. Established risk
prediction tools such as the NCI's Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool were developed and validated on
white populations and have been shown to perform poorly in Black women and have not yet been tested in
Black men. In this grant our overarching goal is to develop new personalized CRC risk tools with improved
accuracy that are uniquely tailored for Black Americans, and are built and validated on the data of Black men
and women. Our new web-based risk models will be developed using the rich longitudinal data of large
prospective established US cohorts of Black adults in the Southern Community Cohort Study and Multiethnic
Cohort Study with external validation in three further cohorts of Black adults. Our three aims are: (a) to develop
and externally validate new risk prediction models for colorectal cancer in Black men and women based upon
easily obtainable lifestyle, demographic, social and screening factors; (b) to build dynamic risk models for CRC
for Black adults using modern statistical and machine-learning methods to obtain optimal prediction
performance, and (c) to determine if accounting for the site of the colorectal cancer tumor improves the
individualized prediction accuracy of our new risk models in Black adults. Due to the high CRC incidence and
death rates in Black adults, our new risk prediction models will have significant and far-reaching implications
for colorectal cancer screening and mortality in the Black community. Our new clinical risk tools will provide
accurate personalized risk assessments of CRC which can be used by Black adults and their physicians to
identify those at high risk and to target optimal, timely and effective CRC screening and lifestyle prevention
strategies, leading to earlier detection of CRC, removal of precancerous polyps during colonoscopy and
reduced mortality. Our proposed work closely aligns with current key initiatives of NCI to support research on
improving health equity in cancer."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fatal form of lung cancer whose development is closely associated with
tobacco smoking. Patients with SCLC have a median overall survival of only 8-10 months after initial diagnosis.
SCLC development is frequently associated with mutations in TP53 (p53), RB, and related tumor suppressor
genes that govern transit through the cell cycle. Disruption of these genes leads to small, rapidly dividing cells.
Despite identical mutations, SCLC cells can adopt one of several distinct transcriptional/epigenetic states,
including neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine states. How these cell states differ is poorly understood. It is
also unclear how best to induce cell death in different SCLC cell states. In this research, we focus on the unique
metabolism of SCLC cells to identify new and exploitable vulnerabilities that can be used to kill SCLC cells.
In preliminary RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies we find that SCLC
metabolism is cell state-dependent. Our results pinpoint a cell-state-specific role for cystine/cysteine (Cys)
metabolism in SCLC biology. We find that both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine SCLC cells require Cys
to proliferate. In the absence of Cys, non-neuroendocrine cells stop dividing whereas neuroendocrine cells die.
Intriguingly, cell death responses are also cell state-dependent: ASCL1high neuroendocrine cells primarily die
from apoptosis while NEUROD1high neuroendocrine cells die from ferroptosis. These findings suggest cell state-
specific differences in SCLC metabolism may regulate distinct sensitivities to apoptotic versus non-apoptotic cell
death.
In this research, we will determine how Cys deprivation triggers cell state-specific lethal mechanisms in SCLC
cells. We propose three Specific Aims. We will first determine how distinct neuroendocrine cell states dictate the
choice to die by apoptosis versus ferroptosis, focusing on the role of the GCN2/ATF4 amino acid sensing
pathway and polyunsaturated phospholipid metabolism. Next, we will determine how the Notch and the NRF2
signaling pathways govern the responses of neuroendocrine versus non-neuroendocrine cell states to Cys
deprivation. Finally, we will develop a novel Cys-degrading enzyme therapy that selectively targets SCLC cells
to induce cell death by recognizing specific cell surface antigens. These studies will test our central hypothesis,
which is that Cys metabolism represent a novel targetable vulnerability for SCLC. Altogether, this research will
unveil novel links between cell state, metabolism, and cell death in SCLC. Ultimately, we aim to show how
targeting this metabolic network could lead to new treatments for this devastating disease."

Dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries (“duals”) frequently have complex clinical and social needs.
Compared with non-duals, dual beneficiaries are poorer, more likely to qualify for Medicare due to disability,
and be racial and ethnic minorities. Structuring health benefits to meet the needs of duals is challenging due to
fragmented financing and poor coordination between the two programs. Private Medicare Advantage plans
could be a potentially promising vehicle for better integrating Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Duals are
increasingly enrolling in MA plans with over half (56%) of 12 million duals enrolled in MA in 2022. The relative
value of MA vs. Traditional Medicare (TM) remains uncertain, however, and evidence on differences in care
patterns and outcomes for duals in MA vs. TM is extremely limited. Moreover, because of potential differential
selection into MA, estimating causal effects of MA vs. TM on outcomes is challenging. This study will examine
longitudinal enrollment patterns among Medicaid beneficiaries as they qualify for Medicare, and assess
beneficiary-, county-, and state-level predictors of enrollment in MA vs. TM and enrollment continuity (Aim 1).
To assess the effects of MA vs. TM on utilization and outcomes, we will compare Medicaid utilization and
spending for duals in MA vs. TM, including long-term services and supports (LTSS) and Medicaid-covered
behavioral health services (Aim 2), and Medicare utilization and spending (e.g., prescription drug adherence,
hospitalizations, post-acute care, and mortality, Aim 3). We will use individual-level Medicaid and Medicare
enrollment, claims, and managed care encounter data, 2019-2026, linked with detailed information on county-
level MA plan offerings and state-level policies to accomplish these aims. To estimate the effects of MA
enrollment and address potential selection bias in Aims 2 and 3, we will leverage a natural experiment created
by recent policies that permit automatic enrollment of Medicaid managed care enrollees in MA plans when they
qualify for Medicare. Across all aims, we will assess variation in MA effects for dual beneficiaries who qualify
for Medicare due to disability (<65 years old) vs. age (65+ years old) since disabled beneficiaries are more
likely to use LTSS and behavioral health benefits covered by Medicaid. We will also assess variation in MA
effects by plan features (e.g., level of integration, supplemental benefit offerings). This study supports AHRQ’s
research priority of examining innovative market approaches to care delivery and financing with a focus on
priority populations (e.g., low-income populations, persons with disabilities, and racial and ethnic minorities).
Findings from this study will provide critically needed evidence to inform ongoing state and federal policy
changes to improve care and outcomes for duals in the context of rapidly increasing MA enrollment."

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are major contributors to the global burden of disease, with ~1.25 billion cases of IDA worldwide. In the United States, ID and IDA are more common in disadvantaged populations, including the low-income groups, Indigenous peoples, and migrants from low-to-middle income countries. The recent realization of the importance of ID as a comorbidity that alters outcomes underscores the need to broaden investigation of the effects of ID in different conditions. We observed in a mouse model an unexpected strong adverse interaction between iron deficiency and inflammation that resulted in increased production of inflammatory mediators and exacerbated apoptosis and tissue injury in the lung, kidney, liver and spleen. This suggests that ID may worsen tissue injury in sepsis, and potentially other inflammatory conditions. Considering the high prevalence of concomitant ID and inflammation around the world, the problem has compelling translational importance. We here propose to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse synergy between ID and inflammatory injury, focusing on macrophage-mediated inflammation, endothelial sensitization to inflammation, and resulting lung and kidney injury. In preliminary work, we uncovered a novel mechanistic link between ID and inflammatory damage whereby ID potentiates inflammation through the NF-κB pathway, and also alters tissue responsiveness to inflammation by modulating the CREB transcription factor and ER stress. We will address the mechanisms in the following aims:
Aim 1. Define the mechanism by which iron deficiency potentiates inflammation—In a mouse model of sterile inflammation we will examine the effect of ID on macrophage phenotype, the NF-kB pathway and systemic inflammation. 
Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms by which iron deficiency potentiates inflammatory lung injury—We will characterize adverse synergy between ID and acute inflammation (LPS) in the lung, and determine how ID modifies the role of CREB transcriptional factor in acute lung injury. 
Aim 3. Determine the mechanisms by which iron deficiency potentiates inflammatory kidney injury—We will characterize adverse synergy between ID and acute inflammation (LPS) in the kidney, and determine how ID modifies ER stress in acute kidney injury. 
These concepts and findings will have both fundamental and translational impact and may be relevant to many inflammatory disorders. They may guide future clinical studies to examine the adverse interaction in human conditions, and to ameliorate inflammatory injury through more effective management of iron deficiency."

This study seeks to advance heterobifunctional degraders that induce targeted protein degradation through
the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Typically, molecular degraders involve a ligand that recruits an E3
ubiquitin ligase and another that targets a protein of interest (POI), forming an E3:Degrader:POI ternary
complex, leading to POI ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Peptide-based
proteolysis targeting chimeras (PepTACs) offer distinct advantages over small molecule degraders for
targeting protein-protein interactions due to their specificity, manufacturability, ease of design, and expansive
binding surface area. However, due to challenges related to their limited cellular permeability and stability,
which is evident in the modest potencies (micromolar range) of recently reported PepTACs, structure-function
studies to improve their catalytic activity have not been investigated. We highlight a recent breakthrough
where we facilitate PepTAC transport at nanomolar concentrations into cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs),
establishing a robust platform for our proposed studies. We aim to explore the structural attributes of
PepTACs to improve their catalytic activity and enhance target protein degradation. Our hypothesis revolves
around modifying PepTAC structure and amphipathicity to improve degradation efficiency, leveraging prior
literature showing that small molecule degraders with enhanced ternary complex stability drive greater target
protein degradation rates. Our study comprises three key aims: the first focuses on identifying the optimal
location of the E3 ligand to create a PepTAC that promotes enhanced positive cooperativity and rapid
ubiquitination. The second aim investigates how PepTAC structure impacts LNP loading, stability, and
intracellular transport. Finally, our third aim proposes a universal strategy for LNP loading based on tuning
PepTAC lipophilicity to enhance LNP encapsulation and systemic stability. Achieving these aims would
unlock the potential of PepTACs as valuable tools for cell-specific targeted protein degradation and
broadening access to a valuable class of peptide-based protein degraders."

Cancer in adolescents and young adults (AYA) is defined as a diagnosis in individuals aged 15-39 years and is
diagnosed in approximately 90,000 AYAs each year. Current treatment regimens for AYAs diagnosed with
cancer often include cardiotoxic treatment regimens, which have been associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular dysfunction in survivors. Our preliminary data indicates that hearts in AYA cancer patients
exposed to cardiotoxic treatment modalities have a functional phenotype that appears to mirror heart function
in non-treatment exposed patients who are decades older. The incidence of this possible accelerated cardiac
aging phenotype in the survivor AYA cancer population is unknown, potential differences by race/ethnicity and
genetic ancestry are unclear, and how known biological markers of aging correlate with heart function and
potentially further influence the development of cardiotoxicity has not been investigated. To address this gap in
our understanding of cardiac aging in survivors of AYA cancer, we will test the overall hypothesis that an
accelerated cardiac aging phenotype contributes to the development of poor cardiovascular health in survivors
of AYA cancer, and that other markers of aging can further identify those at greatest risk for cardiovascular
disfunction. Towards this, the proposal has two objectives: 1) to elucidate and define accelerated cardiac aging
in a diverse survivors of AYA cancer population (N=1,200) and 2) to identify predictors of an accelerated
cardiac aging phenotype and the impact of race/ethnicity, genetic ancestry, social determinants of health, and
established aging biomarkers on this phenotype. To achieve these objectives, this proposal will leverage a
diverse survivors of AYA cancer cohort anchored to echocardiographic assessments of cardiac function:
Project DANCES. Data and biospecimens will enable investigation into accelerated cardiac aging and multi-
level assessment (individual, neighborhood, and population) of drivers of this phenotype. Established aging
biomarkers will also be analyzed to identify relationships with accelerated cardiac aging. With the overall 5-
year survival rate for AYA cancer patients remaining over 84%, there is a growing segment of survivors of AYA
cancer who have the potential to enjoy several more decades of life, cancer-free, highlighting the importance of
prioritizing their long-term health post-cancer treatment. Cardiac dysfunction and morbidity is a major late
effect in this population and the proposed research efforts are designed to identify risk factors and drivers of
these events – across a diverse AYA patient population."

Advanced age is the leading risk factor for all chronic diseases. It is associated with a host of genetic,
immunologic, and physiologic changes that contribute to progressive tissue dysfunction and an increased risk of
mortality. Although many hallmarks of aging have been identified, a key physiological feature of aging is
decreased tissue perfusion and an inability to match perfusion to the metabolic requirements of organ function.
The impacts of such deficits in perfusion are more pronounced in tissues with high oxygen demand; hence, due
to its high energy demand, the heart is particularly vulnerable to perfusion deficits. Acute increases in myocardial
demand, such as those due to increased physical activity, are met by an increase in perfusion (i.e., hyperemia).
This increase in myocardial perfusion is triggered by metabolic signals that evoke coronary vasodilation. Our
recent work shows that increases in O2 demand in cardiomyocytes modify the pyridine nucleotide redox potential
(i.e. elevates NADH:NAD) in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, which stimulates voltage-gated K+ (Kv)
channel activity to promote vasodilation. Inhibition of this heterocellular signaling results in hypoperfusion and
acute pump failure during stress. We propose that disruption to this signaling is the key mechanism underlying
the progressive age-dependent loss of coupling between myocardial metabolism and coronary vascular tone.
Moreover, because cardiac output is essential for adequate perfusion and function of all peripheral tissues,
diminished cardiac function at high workloads (e.g., during exercise) likely contributes to widespread dysfunction
and could explain the pervasive deleterious effects of aging. Our preliminary data show that aged mice have
reduced myocardial perfusion, impaired diastolic and systolic function, and lower exercise capacity compared
with sex-matched young mice. Consistent with cardiac metabolic remodeling as an underlying cause of these
changes, recapitulating the metabolic profile of the aged significantly blunts work-dependent paracrine redox
signals to the vasculature, and suppresses the hyperemic response, consistent with a loss of redox-dependent
Kv channel stimulation. Furthermore, acute interventions that decrease cardiomyocyte carbohydrate metabolism
(ketone body infusion) rescue myocardial perfusion in aged mice. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that age-dependent changes in myocardial metabolism suppress pyridine nucleotide redox-
dependent K+ efflux in vascular smooth muscle, leading to progressive uncoupling of coronary perfusion from
myocardial workload. Accordingly, our specific aims are to: (1) delineate age-dependent changes in cardiac
metabolism, myocardial perfusion, and left ventricular function; (2) assess the impact of changes in myocardial
glucose metabolism on redox-dependent myocardial hyperemia; and (3) determine the efficacy of myocardial
metabolic interventions to prevent age-dependent exercise intolerance and cardiac remodeling. This project will
elucidate the mechanism underlying a key physiological defect associated with aging and provide new insights
into how this defect could be attenuated to prolong cardiovascular health and function over the lifespan."

Project Title: Long-term Effects of a household Air Pollution intervention: Follow-up of a randomized
controlled trial
Globally, nearly 3 billion people are exposed to household air pollution (HAP) from the use of solid fuels
(biomass or coal) for cooking and heating. In 2019, HAP accounted for an estimated 2.3 million premature
deaths and 3.6% of global disability-adjusted life years lost. As a strategy to mitigate HAP and improve health
outcomes, we recently completed an 18-month intervention of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves and fuel
(HAPIN trial; UM1HL134590, MPIs: Checkley, Clasen, Peel), however current evidence suggests that the
health benefits of HAP reduction may not become apparent until several years later. Leveraging the
participant cohort and comprehensive data collected in the HAPIN trial, we seek to determine the long-
term effects of an 18-month LPG stove, continuous fuel and behavioral messaging intervention
on health outcomes among children in Puno, Peru (n=709). We will measure clinical outcomes, kitchen
concentrations and personal exposures to PM2.5 once yearly and monitor biomass cooking stoves continuously
using temperature loggers throughout the study period. We will examine whether health outcomes of
intervention participants (lung function, cardiovascular risk profile, and neurodevelopmental outcomes) differ to
those from control households through age eight and conduct exposure-response analyses based on the PM2.5
exposure and stove use data during the intervention and subsequent follow-up period. Additionally, we will
evaluate if intervention households continue to use LPG for a higher percentage of cooking time than controls
and to experience lower PM2.5 exposures.
This study will provide valuable insight on the longer-term effects
of HAP mitigation during a critical period of child development and generate evidence which can inform
government policies for clean fuel intervention programs. Moreover, it will contribute unique data on pediatric
lung function measures and childhood cardiovascular disease risk, which is currently limited in low- and
middle-income countries."

neurodegenerative disease. Smartphone-based digital assessment tools have potential to overcome
accessibility limitations of traditional in-person neuropsychological evaluations, as they are remote and utilize
ubiquitous mobile technology. Examining digital assessment methods strongly aligns with Actions 2.B.1
(""Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools"") and 2.B.2 (""Support technology to advance mobile

study are to determine the utility of passive smartphone metrics to measure and monitor clinical outcomes in
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by testing associations with gold-standard
measures of cognition, neurodegeneration, and functional impairment cross-sectionally and longitudinally. This
study will be among the first to examine passive smartphone monitoring in FTD and AD, which if successful,
would contribute to a low-burden, highly scalable, continuous monitoring technique for timely detection and
longitudinal measurement of neurobehavioral changes with potential to improve access to dementia care."

Treatment of biofilm-associated infections, such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-
tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), can be extremely challenging, especially when these infectious agents co-
infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) or other diseases. This application seeks to understand
community interactions between P. aeruginosa and the antibiotic resistant NTM Mycobacterium abscessus. P.
aeruginosa and M. abscessus are both found in the same environmental reservoirs and are co-isolated from
individuals with CF and surgical site/soft tissue infections. Indeed, studies demonstrate that M. abscessus
positive CF individuals are more likely to be infected with P. aeruginosa. Despite this, there is limited
understanding of the interaction between these two important opportunistic pathogens. We recently
investigated M. abscessus and P. aeruginosa interactions and reported several novel observations. P.
aeruginosa potently antagonizes both rough and smooth M. abscessus variants, yet only when co-cultured in
dual-species biofilms; antagonism was not observed in planktonic co-culture. Multiple P. aeruginosa strains
exhibited antagonism, and P. aeruginosa-mediated antagonism was observed with another NTM strain,
Mycobacterium smegmatis. Surprisingly, antagonism did not require known P. aeruginosa contact-dependent
or -independent killing, motility, or oxygen/iron sequestration mechanisms. Thus, we hypothesize that inter-
bacterial antagonism of M. abscessus by P. aeruginosa in dual-species biofilms is mediated by a novel
antibacterial strategy. Aim 1 will utilize several complementary strategies to identify the mechanism of
interbacterial antagonism. Aim 2 seeks to investigate M. abscessus and P. aeruginosa interactions under
conditions that closely mimic those found in the host. The growing prevalence of M. abscessus infections and
their recalcitrance to both host clearance and antibiotics highlight an urgent need to find new strategies to
successfully treat these persistent infections. Successful completion of this proposal will advance our
understanding of the novel P. aeruginosa antagonistic mechanism towards M. abscessus biofilms and provide
novel biofilm targets that could be leveraged to augment antimicrobial efficacy in people with inflammatory and
muco-obstructive lung disorders such as CF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non-CF
bronchiectasis as well as with other NTM lung infections such as Mycobacterium avium."

Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is a Gram-negative bacterium emerging as a major cause of nosocomial
infections. The most frequent clinical manifestations of Ab infection are ventilator-associated pneumonia and
catheter-related bloodstream/urinary infection, in addition to that of wounds. The rapid emergence of its multidrug
resistant phenotype makes Ab infection increasingly difficulty to treat, thus, there is a timely need to develop a
nonantibiotics-based intervention, e.g., vaccination, to control this bacterial disease. The goal of this proposal is
to further address the current gaps associated with Acinetobacter vaccine development by (1) assessing the
efficacy of novel chimeric polypeptide vaccines, (2) identifying potential immune correlates that can be used as
protective biomarkers and efficacy indicators for future vaccine development. Specifically, individual peptides
containing both T cell and B cell epitopes in our previously constructed protective Acinetobacter Multi-Epitope
Vaccines (AMEV1 and AMEV2), will be characterized for their immunogenicity and down selected to construct
a refined vaccine, AMEV3, for improved protection against pulmonary Acinetobacter infection. The AMEV3-
mediated protection will be characterized by assessing survival rates, reduction of bacterial burdens, and
preventing pathology in conventional C57BL/6 and humanized HLA-DR4 transgenic mice. Furthermore, the
protective role of antibodies generated by AMEV3 immunization will be studied by assessing passive
immunization efficacy, serum bactericidal activity, and enhancement of opsonophagocytic killing. Results of this
proposed study will advance our scientific knowledge of developing multivalent B/T epitope subunit vaccines and
gain insight into the protective mechanisms of immune sera against Ab infection."

Staphylococcus aureus is a human-adapted pathogen that replicates by asymptomatically colonizing its host.
S. aureus is also the causative agent of purulent skin and soft tissue infections as well as bloodstream
infections that result in the metastatic seeding of abscess lesions in all organ tissues. A hallmark of infection
and colonization is recurrence, a phenomenon that reflects both a failure of the host to generate protective
immunity and the highly versatile capacity of this pathogen to surmount innate and adaptive immune defenses.
As a consequence, approaches to identify the protective antigens of S. aureus to develop a successful vaccine
have failed, leading to the notion that staphylococcal-neutralizing adaptive responses may not be sufficient to
reduce burdens imposed by this pathogen. Here, we find that this might not always be the case.
Mice lacking
functional H2-O (the equivalent of human HLA-DO) inoculated with a mouse-adapted strain of S. aureus
efficiently de-colonized the pathogen. De-colonized mice resisted bloodstream challenge with the MRSA
isolate USA300 suggesting that they were immune to the pathogen. We found that T-cell dependent B cell
responses were required to control
S. aureus colonization in H2-O-deficient mice and that H2-O-deicient mice
produced higher titer S. aureus-specific antibodies compared to wild-type mice. H2-O is a negative regulator of
MHC-II peptide loading and presentation and was shown to restrict the loading of high affinity peptides. Thus,
we hypothesize that the muted immune responses against S. aureus are derepressed in mice lacking H2-O.
We propose to exploit this observation and identify S. aureus-immunodominant antigens and -specific T cells
and B cells as well as antibody sub-classes that lead to decolonization of the pathogen."

Aging is associated with decline in skeletal muscle function even in healthy individuals, and the molecular
mechanisms underlying this aging process are incompletely understood. The overall goal of the proposed
project is to discover genomic alterations in skeletal muscle that are associated with aging, with the long term
goal of creating a better understanding of mechanisms of aging in order to help prevent or slow down the aging
related decline in muscle function. It is known that expression of hundreds of genes is altered in healthy
muscle aging, we will dissect the aging muscle transcriptome in two ways beyond gene expression. Alternative
splicing of messenger RNA creates diversity in the proteome and has been implicated in causing disease.
Additionally, alternative splicing can cause exonization of previously intronic sequences, potentially leading to
an amino acid sequence not previously seen by the immune system. Based on our preliminary data, Aim 1 will
explore if alternative splicing of mRNA results in quantitative differential isoform changes associated with
aging, resulting in increased expression of non-functional proteins that are relevant for healthy muscle function.
Moreover, we will predict protein changes from alternative splicing and the potential for generation of novel
peptide sequences. On the other hand, aging is associated with inflammatory changes (referred to as
“inflammaging”). In Aim 2, we will investigate a potential source of inflammaging by quantifying expression of
transposable elements in the aging muscle including LINE-1, HERV-K, and SINEs. All proposed analyses will
be conducted on two existing datasets, including RNA-sequencing data from muscle biopsies of healthy
individuals, which is ideal to isolate the effect of aging on the muscle transcriptome without influence from
diseases more common in older individuals. Additionally, we will validate our results in a much larger and less
selected RNA-sequencing data of hundreds of muscle biopsies, which will add confidence in the external
validity of our results."

Uveitis is a heterogenous group of ocular inflammatory diseases that results in significant ocular morbidity and
can cause long-term blindness if not diagnosed accurately and treated adequately. A major challenge in
uveitis, however, is the inadequate clinical and laboratory methods to determine the exact cause of the
inflammatory response. Furthermore, biomarker discovery is lacking in uveitis. Here, we propose to leverage
programmable phage display peptidomes coupled with high-throughput sequencing to identify autoantigens
and antibodies important for uveitis. In Aim 1, we will use a comprehensive human peptidome phage display
library to bio-pan for autoantigens in the intraocular fluid and tear specimens of patients with idiopathic anterior
uveitis. In Aim 2, we will generate a comprehensive viral peptidome phage library to agnostically bio-pan for
viral antibodies in the intraocular fluid and plasma specimens of patients with presumed viral-associated
anterior uveitis but for whom conventional diagnostics failed to reveal an etiology. Viral and human peptidomes
have not been applied to the intraocular fluid and tears of uveitis patients. We anticipate these experiments will
result in new diagnostics for uveitis and thus have the potential to improve patient care and clinical outcomes."
10995636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, with the recent rise in obesity prevalence strongly
correlated with widespread access to palatable, energy-dense foods. These foods, typically highly processed
and rich in calories, salt, sugar, and fat, exhibit extraordinary appetitive properties, leading to pathological
overeating. For instance, palatable foods can override the body's satiety signals, while regular consumption can
cause taste desensitization, making healthier options taste bland in comparison. Furthermore, it is hypothesized
that the reinforcing properties of such foods activate reward circuitry, leading to a dissociation between caloric
need (the number of calories required to maintain stable weight) and food intake (the number of calories
consumed), which ultimately results in obesity. While numerous brain areas are involved in appetite control, this
research focuses on the ventral pallidum (VP), a major relay structure in the reward system which plays a key
role in processing the pleasure and motivation associated with ingestive behavior. However, the potential to
manipulate VP activity to suppress or reverse excessive body weight remains unexplored. In this proposal, I plan
to use a multifaceted approach to investigate VP neuronal responses during palatable food consumption and
how this activity contributes to pathological consumption behavior. Since foods high in dietary fat
disproportionately affect satiety and induce hyperphagia in humans and other animals, I hypothesize that VP
neurons are more strongly activated by fat consumption than carbohydrate consumption. To test this, I will record
population calcium signals from VP neurons in head-fixed mice consuming mixtures with varying proportions of
fats and carbohydrates. With the long-term goal of evaluating whether ventral pallidal manipulations can serve
as a viable therapeutic strategy for obesity treatment, I will employ a chronic inactivation strategy on VP neurons
and assess its effectiveness in producing weight loss in obese animals. Understanding the neural basis of obesity
pathology, and specifically why fat-enriched foods induce hyperphagia, will inform the development of future
therapeutics aimed at achieving substantial weight loss in individuals with obesity."

HCMV encodes multiple proteins that suppress lytic phase immediate early (IE) transcription during latency.
These include Us28 and UL138. We identified a new repressor of the MIEP during latency: the Pentamer.
The Pentamer is a five-member glycoprotein complex consisting of gH, gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131 that
is required for entry into epithelial and endothelial cells. We determined the Pentamer represses the MIEP
during both lytic and latent infections. Provocatively, we determined at least two different Pentamer alleles
exist, one that strongly represses the MIEP, and one that weakly represses the MIEP. We hypothesize that
HCMV uses unique Pentamer alleles to create different sub-sets of virions pre-programmed to either
initiate a lytic infection or to establish latency. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will create genetically
matched virus strains (laboratory and clinical) with pro-lytic or pro-latency Pentamer alleles and test them for
their propensity to initiate lytic infection in fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells, to select against
Pentamer function during fibroblast propagation, and to establish latency in primary CD34+ cells. In Aim 2
we will determine the mechanism through which the Pentamer represses the MIEP."
10982889,"The Administrative Core (AC) has primary responsibility for overseeing and facilitating all aspects of the Center
for Transformative Infectious Disease Research on Climate, Health and Equity in a Changing Environment (C-
CHANGE). These duties encompass both the Center’s transdisciplinary, community-engaged research and its
research capacity building. As such, the AC will house the Center’s leadership, including multi-PIs Dr. Alexander
Travis (Cornell) and Dr. Marinda Oosthuizen (University of Pretoria), lead administrators, Elizabeth Parr (Cornell)
and Ninette Kotzee (University of Pretoria), and program facilitator Jonathan Tager (University of Pretoria). The
AC will provide structure/ support to test the Center’s overall hypothesis, that community-based research that
integrates diverse kinds of data will drive the development of predictive epidemiological models. These will in
turn enable the design and rigorous testing of preventative interventions–a transformative shift from responding
to outbreaks to preventing them before they occur. To realize C-CHANGE’s ultimate goal, the AC must fulfill its
functions of ensuring efficient administrative and organizational operations. The AC will accomplish this mission
through performance of three Specific Aims. First, the AC will provide oversight/governance as a whole, guiding
our science to ensure that it is community-engaged, transdisciplinary, and impact-oriented. We will manage our
External Advisory Committee and self-evaluation processes, and manage and deploy the Center’s financial and
personnel resources. Second, we will ensure timely and efficient flow of scientific information across all
components of the Center, and from the Center to external stakeholders. To create the kinds of predictive models
that are our goal, we must integrate social, climate, land-use, animal and human health, and vector and pathogen
genomic data. To have these models be actionable, and approaches disseminated broadly, we must ensure that
they are informed by both the rural communities with whom we work, and policymakers who might use them.
Third, a major objective of the P20 mechanism is to build research capacity in climate change and health. Toward
this goal, the AC will run competitive pilot grant and Rapid Response Fund grant mechanisms that will favor Early
Stage Investigators and collaborations between Cornell/Weill Cornell Medicine and the University of Pretoria.
These grants will enable junior faculty to test feasibility of ideas, generate preliminary data, and demonstrate
ability to have productive partnerships and community engagement. Lastly, the AC will run a training program
focusing on post-doctoral associates and Early Stage Investigator faculty across both Cornell and the University
of Pretoria. This program will enable groups that are historically underrepresented in science, who make up the
majority of scientists in the Center, to create transdisciplinary networks and learn the “soft skills” that are essential
for climate change and health research and impact, such as communicating with diverse audiences ranging from
the public to government and the private sector, and across disciplines/professions. Although a focus of our
training program, communication and partnership are key principles that guide all the AC’s activities."
10982890,"PROJECT 1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our proposed studies will investigate how climate change affects risk of spillover of zoonotic infections from
bats. Our work will help identify evidence-based strategies to prevent disease emergence in multiple ecological
settings. Bats are the known or progenitor hosts of four of the nine diseases identified by the World Health
Organization as research priorities. Bats also may be exquisitely vulnerable to changes in climate because
their food resources are climate driven and physiologically they are sensitive to temperature changes. We will
leverage two long-running datasets on emerging pathogens from bat hosts to examine the role of climate in
driving shedding patterns and spatial behavior of bats and likelihood of exposures in humans.
Our methods, innovative both conceptually and methodologically, will use two complementary datasets, one
from Australia and one from South Africa. We will integrate these datasets to move beyond assumption-laden
correlations of spillover risk towards mechanistic understanding of how climatic drivers interact with ecological,
environmental, and host-viral drivers of infections to drive disease emergence. Our work will help test whether
mechanisms that drive spillover in South Africa and Australia are similar and are therefore likely to be
generalizable to other geographical areas. Our work sets the stage for remote sensing methods to identify
places and periods to prioritize for prevention of spillover. In Aim 1, we will identify climate-driven effects on
the health of bats, diet, and paramyxo-, corona-, and filovirus infection dynamics in Australia and
South Africa, using retrospective data. Hypothesis: We will observe higher prevalence of viral shedding in
sampled bats after or during specific climatic conditions (e.g., hot, dry, then wet conditions, flood, high rainfall)
and higher prevalence will be correlated to markers of bat health, diet and viral infection dynamics. We will use
novel explainable-AI and Bayesian multilevel models to analyze these data. In Aim 2: we will investigate how
host space-use changes in relation to climate-driven resource availability and how these changes drive
spatial and temporal overlap of bats and humans. Hypothesis: resource constraints on natural food sources
will lead to increased contact between bats, humans, and bridging hosts.
Our work will lead to strategies, derived from empirical data and modeling, that can help prevent spillover of
pathogens from bats to humans. Preventing spillovers reduces human mortality and morbidity, is highly cost-
effective when strategies are successful, and can lead to interventions that buffer effects of climate change on
sensitive species such as bats."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the aged population. An ongoing
conundrum within the AD field is that despite women with dementia outnumbering men two to one, the efficacy
of hormone replacement therapy appears to be limited. This suggests that the mechanism responsible for the
increased risk of AD in women extends beyond direct hormone activity, wherein the neurobiological effects of
sex hormones are dependent on other variables (e.g., angiotensin II). We and others have demonstrated that
angiotensin II, a critical mediator of vasoconstriction, can amplify AD hallmarks in the brain, such as oxidative
stress, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tau tangles. We also discovered that the female sex chromosome
XX is associated with increased angiotensin II activation compared to XY. Further, previous work has shown
that androgens can upregulate angiotensin II signaling, whereas estrogens can downregulate angiotensin II
signaling, alluding to a link between the sex hormones and angiotensin II activation. Notably, post-menopausal
women have higher levels of androgens than estrogens and exhibit increased angiotensin II activity compared
to aged men, which may explain their increased risk for developing AD. We hypothesize that cognitive
impairment and increased AD risk in post-menopausal women is related to upregulated angiotensin II
activation from XX sex chromosome and higher androgens levels due to loss of ovarian estradiol. We will test
this hypothesis directly in aged male and female TgF344-AD rats and four core genotype (FCG) rats. We
propose three specific aims 1) To determine the role of circulating hormones on modulating brain angiotensin
II-associated oxidative stress and cognitive impairment, 2) To examine the role of brain-derived hormones on
modulation of angiotensin II-associated oxidative stress and cognitive impairment, 3) To determine the
independent effects of sex hormones and sex chromosomes on angiotensin II-associated oxidative stress and
cognitive impairment. Our integrative approach will allow us to elucidate mechanisms involved in the observed
sex differences in AD, in which post-menopausal women are at the highest risk for AD and cognitive decline.
These proposed studies will be the first to examine the interaction between sex chromosomes, sex hormones,
brain-derived hormones, and brain angiotensin II activation on accelerated brain aging and cognitive decline."

The long-term objective of this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is to
prepare the candidate for an independent research career in health services and communication research
improving care outcomes for patients with advanced cancer. Despite oncology practice guidelines emphasizing
alignment in patient-clinician understanding of prognosis, treatment intent, and patient values for treatment
decisions in advanced cancer, discordance is common. Consequently, one third of patients with advanced
cancer receive end-of-life care inconsistent with their preferences. Existing approaches to alleviate these gaps
in understanding to promote goal-concordant care have had disappointing results. Inadequate attention to
emotional support and managing uncertainty likely contribute to the shortcomings of existing approaches. We
hypothesize that an interactive visual aid (VIS) used by patients, their caregivers, and clinicians during an
outpatient visit can efficiently and effectively prompt the necessary communication behaviors that target
emotional support and uncertainty management. The candidate proposes an innovative approach to design
and evaluate a VIS to facilitate patient-clinician emotional support and management of uncertainty in the
context of decision-making around stopping cancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy). The
training and mentoring plan is designed to provide knowledge and skills in (1) Designing and leading clinical
trials, (2) Behavioral intervention development (3) Implementation science, and (4) Professional development.
The proposed research will assess patient-caregiver-clinician shared understanding following a serious illness
conversation in the outpatient setting (Aim 1), develop and refine a highly acceptable and usable, interactive
VIS for approaching decisions to stop cancer treatment over time (Aim 2), and evaluate the usability of the
developed VIS for patients with advanced cancer, their caregivers and clinicians during outpatient oncology
visits (Aim 3). The candidate will use the process of user-centered design and the Behavior Change Wheel
intervention development framework to guide the methods and analysis. Aim 1 is anticipated to generate novel
insights into the processes promoting shared understanding, and the patient perspective on the perceived
accuracy of clinician-generated documentation for serious illness conversations. Findings from Aim 1 will be
used to identify the existing communication gaps for structured serious illness conversations in oncology that a
VIS could address (i.e., Needs Assessment). Aims 2 and 3 will generate and evaluate a novel communication
tool – VIS – for approaching decisions to stop cancer treatment. In consultation with his team of mentors and
scientific collaborators/advisors, the candidate will use the training, the results of the research, and the
Behavior Change Wheel intervention development framework to systematically guide the next steps in this line
of work promoting goal-concordant care and submit his first R01 proposal."
10983913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of age-related dementia, is characterized by cognitive
impairment, neurodegeneration, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. Adult
hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a relatively novel form of brain plasticity that refers to the birth of new neurons
in the adult hippocampus, remains strong in healthy human brains but drops steeply in AD patients, even before
the presence of Aβ plaques and NFTs. On the other hand, adult-born neurons are significantly more abundant
in non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology (resilient). AHN levels correlate with cognitive function in
AD and mild cognitive impairment patients. Using Aβ-overexpressing 5×FAD mice, we identified AHN as a
primary event that mediates AD pathogenesis when impaired, and as a potential treatment strategy for AD when
enhanced in combination with elevating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Increasing either AHN or
BDNF alone was not sufficient to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. We hypothesize that stimulating both AHN
and BDNF could serve as a brain resilience enhancing strategy to slow AD. Further study on how AHN and
BDNF cooperate and on how AHN is preserved in resilient brains is required to assess their role as therapeutic
agents to treat cognitive decline in AD. The objective of this proposal is to rigorously test our hypothesis using
mechanistic molecular and cellular techniques, bioinformatics integration, morphological and functional studies,
and behavioral testing. We will achieve our objective by exploring the mechanism(s) by which AHN cooperates
with BDNF and by testing whether our strategy to improve cognition by increasing both AHN and BDNF can be
generalized in tauopathy (Aim 1); by performing integrative single-cell transcriptomic analysis of AHN in AD and
resilient human brains, mouse models, and iPSC-derived neuronal cell models (Aim 2); and by testing the
therapeutic potential of newly-identified pharmacological/natural compounds that trigger AHN and BDNF in AD
(Aim 3). A successful therapy would ideally both remove those pathological hallmarks of AD (e.g., Aβ and tau
pathologies, neuroinflammation, and cell loss) and provide a level of functional recovery. Thus, we will test
whether increasing AHN, in part, could be a potentially powerful adjunct therapeutic for AD that provides
functional recovery."

 In the United States health impacts related to heat exposure are changing rapidly and the burdens are
markedly inequitable. While we have a strong understanding of the hazard, vulnerability, and population factors
driving heat-health risks, and we have information on effective risk reduction interventions, translating these
insights into intervention implementation has been challenging. To address this need and support adaptation at
scale, we have developed Climate and Health Risk Tool (CHaRT), an innovative decision support platform that
supports heat governance processes at the local level. CHaRT provides clear, consistent, transparent risk
assessment at the census tract level and links risk assessment with evidence-based intervention guidance,
allowing for community-engaged adaptation planning. CHaRT has been piloted but not formally evaluated.
 The Research Project has two aims: to evaluate the effectiveness of facilitated engagement with
CHaRT, and to assess barriers and facilitators to CHaRT implementation. To achieve the first aim, we will
measure the intervention’s effectiveness through a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing facilitated
CHaRT engagement with an information-only control. We will recruit 30 local health departments to participate
in the trial with the help of the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO), the national
member organization for local health departments, CDC and Public Health-Seattle & King County, a local
health department that has used CHaRT in a pilot engagement. We will conduct pre-intervention assessments
to capture each organization’s demographics and heat-health activities and describe the breadth and
effectiveness of pre-intervention activities using the RE AIM framework to describe activity Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. One year after intervention delivery, we will again
assess heat-health activities and assess differences in the intervention and control groups. To achieve the
second aim, we will conduct a series of key informant interviews with the intervention group to identify barriers
and facilitators of CHaRT implementation and analyze the data using the Consolidated Framework for
Intervention Research (CFIR).
 Our team is well positioned to do this work based on our prior experience with heat-health vulnerability
and adaptation assessment, implementation of heat-health risk reduction interventions, and experience with
program evaluation and implementation science. The work includes several innovations, including evaluation
of a novel decision support tool, new methods to assess intervention effectiveness, and the use of
implementation science to gain insight into climate adaptation activities. The work will result in several products
and insights and lay the foundation for future work including an expanded randomized trial."

The Community Engagement Core (CEC) is an integral component of the Research and
Engagement on Adaptation for Climate and Health (REACH) initiative, a project of the
University of Washington’s Center for Health and Global Environment. The CEC aims to
address a recognized regional need for concerted action to protect health through the
development of new lines of engagement around adaptation-oriented research with UW
School of Medicine and its partners in the WWAMI region. The CEC seeks to increase
climate and health literacy through partnership building, needs assessment, research
translation and dissemination, and capacity building. In collaboration with Center
leadership, and supported by preliminary community engagement activities, the CEC
has identified 3 focus areas to increase climate and health resilience. The CEC
specifically aims to: (1) Develop new partnerships and identify and prioritize key climate
change & health-related adaptation and implementation needs; (2) Support research
translation and dissemination of REACH work; and (3) Build community engagement
capacity through methodological and training support of our Center cores’ activities.
Specific activities include the following: The convening an extreme heat stakeholder
symposium across the 5 participating WWAMI states; The establishment of a
Community Advisory Board to help prioritize and guide future CEC REACH activities;
the research translation and dissemination of Center work, including creating
user-based stories for REACH’s CHaRT tool; and the development of broader and
deeper community engagement among the project partners and the communities they
serve. The CEC acts as a methodological and translational resource for all the
associated cores. It supports both the research and implementation and evaluation
projects’ community engagement and science communication activities, while building
internal capacity to reach beyond existing partners. It is anticipated to broadly result in
improved adaptation and response to extreme heat events for WWAMI communities;
increased climate-health risk literacy among physician communities; and new
partnerships throughout the WWAMI network."
10985745,"α-Synuclein (αS) is an abundant brain protein that regulates neurotransmission. αS is also implicated in Parkin-
son’s disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and certain forms of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). PDD and DLB are regarded as Lewy Body (LB) Dementia (LBD). Remarkably, about 90% of αS
in the LB and Lewy neurites is in its serine 129 phosphorylated form (pS129). Therefore, pS129 is widely used
as a surrogate marker for pathology. However, we recently demonstrated that physiological pS129 is triggered
by neuronal activity and positively regulates synaptic transmission. These new results raise the critical question
of whether normal and abnormal pS129 can be distinguished. Distinguishing normal and abnormal pS129 will
help us better understand the processes leading to the pathology and refine pS129 as a marker for PD and LBD.
Eventually, these will contribute to developing meaningful therapeutic interventions. A lack of disease-modifying
treatments for PD and LBD is partly due to a lack of insight into how native αS dynamics become aberrant and
its consequences. The sequence of molecular events that turns the states of normal αS into pathological forms
over time is a complex topic, but environmental factors, excess αS, missense mutations in αS, and other genetic
risk factors influence the conversion of “good” αS into “bad”. Our long-term goal is to understand the normal αS
biology and test how their functions are compromised under pathological states by exploiting factors that accel-
erate αS dyshomeostasis. We then seek to convert “bad αS” back to “good αS”. Our objectives are to (i) compare
the biochemical properties of physiological and pathological pS129 and (ii) describe whether or to what extent
the normal synaptic transmission mediated by pS129 is compromised in PD and LBD models. The central hy-
pothesis flows from our recent data on pS129 being part of normal αS homeostasis: we hypothesize that dynamic
activity-dependent pS129 reversibility is impaired when normal αS homeostasis is pathologically perturbed. The
rationale for this project is that understanding normal and abnormal pS129 in neurons is likely to help us quantify
signatures of αS pathology. To achieve the overall objectives, two specific aims will be pursued: 1. Determine
whether or to what extent dynamic activity-dependent pS129 is impaired in familial and sporadic models of PD
and LBD, and 2. Determine whether normal functions of pS129 are affected in αS-based PD and LBD models.
In many ways, the concept of physiological pS129 is new, particularly the dynamic reversibility of pS129. In that
regard, the research proposed in this application is innovative because it uses the concept of dynamic reversi-
bility of pS129 to distinguish “good” and “bad” pS129. Our contributions are expected to be significant because
a) our work will elucidate the differences in the biological properties of normal and abnormal pS129 that occur in
physiological and pathological states, respectively; b) by establishing these distinctions, we will lay the ground-
work for future studies to refine pS129 as a pathological marker and, potentially, a therapeutic target. The pro-
posed research is relevant to NIA’s “AD/ADRD” mission."
10987629,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza continue to circulate and infect birds in Asia with occa-
sional spread into the North American flyway. These necessitate the culling of any poultry farms that test positive for
these strains. Furthermore, through continued circulation, humans remain under constant threat that one of these strains
will reassort and infect humans. While the current strategy for combating these strains is surveillance and biosecurity,
these strategies clearly do not work in many parts of the world, as they are hot zones for these viruses. As an alternative,
vaccinations for poultry and waterfowl would certainly be a boon for human health as they would restrict the number of
influenza strains in these flu reservoirs. Here, we seek to use mRNA vaccines that code for a universal flu Hemagglutinin
antigen we have developed. In tandem with polyanhydride delivery vehicles that impart thermostability to mRNA and
serve as antigen depots, we will vaccinate chicken eggs to determine efficacy against highly pathogenic and low patho-
genic avian influenza strains. We will also develop transgenic mealworms to use as booster or as primary vaccines for
poultry, but eventually waterfowl, for future use as flu vaccine bait stations."

build on the parent study’s prospective design by collecting blood samples concurrently with study visits, and
examine the link between early ASD features and multi-omics signatures in the transcriptome, proteome, and
metabolome. Findings from the proposed Administrative Supplement project could facilitate the potential
discovery of measurable biomarkers associated with early identification of ASD risk and inform groundbreaking

10987363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Abstract
The refinement of gross motor skills, such as locomotion, during development is conserved across vertebrate
species. As an example, locomotor output produced by immature animals is initially coarse and becomes
progressively more refined during development. Although we previously demonstrated, in larval zebrafish, that
neuromodulatory signaling via the dopaminergic system was necessary for the developmental transformation
of locomotor (swimming) activity from an immature to a mature state, the underlying molecular and functional
mechanisms remain elusive. Our goal here is to characterize the functional and molecular mechanisms
underlying the dopaminergic-mediated refinement of spinal locomotor activity using an established vertebrate
model system (larval zebrafish) and a well-validated complement of tools, including electrophysiology,
pharmacology, in vivo functional imaging (calcium and dopamine), and quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results of this project will serve as the basis for a future R01
proposal that will examine the causal relationship between the developmental changes in the dopaminergic
system and locomotor refinement. Overall, since the dopaminergic and motor systems are highly conserved
across vertebrates, we expect these findings to translate to other animals, including humans."
10988520,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes lifelong latent infections in humans. It is responsible for significant disease, ranging from cold sores and genital infections to blindness and fatal encephalitis. There is no effective vaccine and no cure. The long-term objective of this project is a detailed understanding of the intracellular pathway taken by HSV entering during infection. The endocytosis pathway utilized by HSV during entry into human epithelial cells was identified 20 years ago. However, the specific vesicular compartments traversed by HSV during its journey to the nucleus are not known. We demonstrated that HSV does not travel the conventional lysosome-terminal endocytosis pathway during viral entry. Based on our previous results and new preliminary studies, we hypothesize that incoming HSV utilizes a retrograde transport pathway to the Golgi apparatus for successful entry into physiologically relevant cells. Completion of this pilot study will demonstrate that HSV transits the Golgi complex prior to arrival at the nucleus during successful entry. Our experimental design employs techniques of cell biology, biochemistry, microscopy, and molecular virology. Completing this study will establish critical features of the entry pathway taken by HSV in epithelial cells, the in vivo target of primary and recurrent infection. These studies will support the innovative concept that the Golgi complex and Golgi-related functions mediate HSV entry and will lay the foundation for identification of the intracellular site of HSV membrane fusion. Furthermore, the results will aid in the development of new preventions and therapeutics for HSV."
10996860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a viral zoonosis that causes severe disease in ruminants and humans [1].
Concerns are heightened regarding the introduction of RVFV to the U.S. as competent mosquito vectors have
been identified and increased global commerce makes it probable that RVFV will spread to new areas [12].
Despite its pathogenic potential, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines to challenge the global
spread of this infectious organism. The nonstructural small (NSs) protein is the main virulence factor of RVFV,
making it an attractive antiviral target [15]. This proposal aims to close the gap in knowledge regarding the role
that NSs plays in the host autophagy pathway, by identifying the impact of the NSs-LC3 interaction on
autophagy, viral replication, and pathogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis identified four putative LC3-interacting
region (LIR) motifs in the RVFV NSs protein (LIR1-4), suggesting that NSs interacts with LC3 family members,
the host key autophagy proteins. Autophagy is a homeostatic process in which cellular material is degraded
and recycled and can be exploited by viruses to facilitate replication or can be antiviral. [31]. Preliminary
studies confirmed that NSs interacts with all six LC3-family members in vitro and in RVFV-infected cells.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) demonstrated favorable binding between LIR4 and all six-human LC3
family members, however little to no binding was observed between NSs LIR1-3 and LC3, indicating that LIR4
is mediating interaction between NSs and LC3. Additionally, ITC data and co-immunoprecipitation data in
RVFV infected cells demonstrated the importance of F261 within LIR4 for the NSs-LC3 interaction. Crystal
structures showed that the predominant NSs-LC3 interactions at the binding interface involve the side chain of
LIR4 F261, furthering the importance of LIR4 F261 for NSs-LC3 interaction. Aim 1 will define the autophagy
molecular mechanism of the NSs-LC3 interaction and the effect of loss of NSs-LC3 interaction through F261S
substitution on autophagy. Aim 2 will determine the impact of NSs-LC3 interaction and regulation of autophagy
on viral pathogenesis and survival through mouse studies using RVFV ZH548 wild type vs. F261S viruses.
This fellowship will prepare the trainee for a career as a Professional Investigator in Academia through an
intensive individualized training program facilitated by my strong sponsor Dr. Kehn-Hall, collaborators, and
opportunities provided by Virginia Tech. Taken together, this fellowship will define the mechanism by which
NSs and LC3 interact to modulate autophagy and the impact of the NSs-LC3 interaction on RVFV
pathogenesis in a mouse model, providing a potential future therapeutic target."
10994758,"Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), causes more than 30
rare but devastating diseases. Despite their importance to monogenic disease, the frequency and function of
repeat expansions are unknown in complex human diseases. A failure to catalog and understand these repeat
expansions in human disease will make it impossible to capitalize on this information to develop new TR-
targeting therapeutics, which I previously showed can rescue expression of genes dysregulated in disease
(Erwin et al., Science 2017).
 My central hypothesis is that repeat expansions are recurrent in complex human diseases and alter cell
function through the regulation of gene expression. While I have extensive training and experience in the study
of TRs with chemical biology, molecular biology, and functional genomics, I am new to bioinformatics and
human genetics. Therefore, my overall objective is to obtain additional training in bioinformatics and human
genetics and to catalog recurrent repeat expansions and determine their relevance to human disease. This
study is the next logical step toward my goal of becoming an independent investigator studying TR sequences
in the genome. To achieve my goal, I will take full advantage of the excellent training environment at Stanford
University.
 The expected outcomes include a new set of bioinformatic tools to identify repeat expansions (Aim 1)
and a catalog of recurrent repeat expansions in human disease (Aim 2), which will provide a new angle to
analyze thousands of NIH-funded, publicly-available human genome datasets. Furthermore, characterizing the
function of previously-unrecognized, recurrent repeat expansions will determine whether some of these
expansions are functionally important for human disease (Aim 3). The proposed study will enable me to apply
my background in TR biology to an important problem while receiving additional training in bioinformatics and
human genetics and preparing me for a successful career as an independent investigator. These results will
illuminate our understanding of the human genome and set the stage for a new class of precision-targeted
therapeutics."
10995733,"Project Summary
Psychiatric emergencies comprise a large and increasing proportion of emergency department (ED) visits, with
many psychiatric patients receiving suboptimal care while boarding in EDs. The Emergency Medical Treatment
and Labor Act (EMTALA) established a duty for hospitals to screen and stabilize patients presenting to EDs
regardless of ability to pay. EMTALA requires that any patient with a medical or psychiatric complaint
presenting to a dedicated ED have a timely screening exam, stabilization of emergent conditions, and transfer
to another facility for a higher level of care if services required for stabilization are unavailable at the original
facility. Hospitals violating EMTALA are at risk for termination of Medicare provider agreements, which typically
results in hospital closure or downgrading of emergency services. Despite potentially grave consequences,
hospitals continue to violate EMTALA. Overall, 17% of EMTALA citations are labeled by the enforcing agency
as involving psychiatric conditions. However, a review of recently available data suggests that these labels
underestimate citations involving psychiatric conditions. Specific conditions and circumstances (e.g., suicidal
ideation, threats to staff) resulting in care denial or outcomes of involved patients (e.g., hospitalization, death,
incarceration) have not been explored. A more rigorous exploration and categorization of individual citations
associated with the care of patients with psychiatric emergencies is warranted to inform care, encourage
compliance, and maintain uninterrupted provision of emergency services. Higher odds of EMTALA citations are
found among hospitals that are large, urban, for-profit, and disproportionately serve Medicaid patients.
However, hospital-level factors associated with EMTALA citations involving psychiatric emergencies have not
been explored. Hospitals with less capacity to care for patients with psychiatric conditions on-site are more
likely to discharge patients compared with hospitals that have greater capacity. Whether the capacity of a
hospital (or lack thereof) to stabilize patients with psychiatric emergencies is associated with risk of EMTALA
citation remains uninvestigated. A multidisciplinary team, including an AHRQ-supported sponsor, co-sponsor,
and key advisors, will provide support and guidance as the applicant develops and completes projects to 1)
identify and characterize EMTALA citation events involving psychiatric emergencies, 2) explore novel
measures of hospital capacity to care for patients with psychiatric emergencies, and 3) evaluate the
association between hospital capacity to care for patients with psychiatric emergencies and receipt of EMTALA
citations. Through didactics and completion of these projects, the applicant will gain experience with 1) health
policy/analysis, 2) qualitative methods, 3) quantitative methods, 4) impactful dissemination of findings, and 5)
writing compelling funding proposals, as he trains to become an independent health services researcher."
10996333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria, continue to be major drivers of infectious disease-related
morbidity and mortality. Plasmodium evades sterilizing immunity in part by inducing proinflammatory changes
that interfere with the orchestration of humoral immunity targeted towards parasite-specific antigens. This is
seemingly not limited to parasite-specific immunity, as malaria can interfere with the efficacy of other routine
vaccinations; the underlying mechanism of these impairments is poorly understood. Plasmodium parasites are
endemic throughout Central and West Africa, regions in which highly pathogenic Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV)
episodically causes outbreaks. An FDA-approved, live-attenuated, recombinant vaccine called ERVEBO
stimulates antibody responses directed against the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and has shown promise during
EBOV outbreaks in Guinea in 2016 and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2019. Recent studies in the
DRC suggest that current ring vaccination with ERVEBO can be highly porous; ~30% of EBOV-infected
participants in a recent antiviral trial in the DRC were prior recipients of the vaccine. A possible explanation for
this vaccine failure is acute Plasmodium infection of vaccine recipients at the time of vaccination, resulting in
reduced immune responses to the vaccine. Utilizing experimental Plasmodium infection and clinically relevant
vaccine administration strategies in a mouse model, my preliminary data show that mice that are parasitemic at
time of vaccination exhibit dramatically reduced levels of EBOV GP-specific antibodies, reduced vaccine-induced
germinal center (GC) formation in the draining lymph node (LN), and reduced vaccine load in the draining LN.
These data inform our hypothesis that Plasmodium impairs multiple steps in the generation of a robust humoral
response to ERVEBO, which will be tested through the following specific aims: 1) determining the underlying
mechanistic impact of Plasmodium infection on ERVEBO-induced GC responses in the draining LN, and 2)
determining the impacts of Plasmodium on antibody producing plasma cells and the functionality of EBOV GP-
specific antibodies. Success of these studies will reveal mechanisms through which Plasmodium can impair
ERVEBO vaccine responses and provide clinically actionable approaches to overcome this impairment.
The experiences, techniques, mentoring, and concepts in this proposal were specifically tailored to Mr. Jonah
Elliff and his training goals. As a developing researcher interested in improving strategies to treat and prevent
severe infectious disease, Mr. Elliff is performing these studies through the Medical Scientist Training Program
(MSTP) at University of Iowa under the scientific mentorship of Drs. Wendy Maury and Noah Butler, who provide
individualized training at the intersection of virology, immunology, and vaccinology. Longer term plans for Mr.
Elliff will be to complete his MSTP training and pursue a research residency in internal medicine, followed by an
infectious disease fellowship, and ultimately a faculty position at an academic research center to continue
investigating virus-host interactions and immune responses that control viral infections."
10978601,"The defining pathological hallmark of Lewy body diseases (LBDs) is the accumulation of misfolded a-synuclein
(aSyn) aggregates, which are heavily phosphorylated at Ser129 (pS129-aSyn). LBDs comprise an array of often
overlapping conditions, including Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Parkinson’s
disease dementia (PDD), and PD with AD pathology (PD/AD). aSyn is known to regulate synaptic vesicle (SV)
trafficking, including endocytosis. However, how aSyn regulates the endocytic process is poorly understood. In
the pathological setting, aSyn pathology is transmitted from cell to cell through the secretion, internalization,
seeding, and transport of misfolded and toxic aSyn. Despite much progress in understanding these processes,
mechanisms governing the internalization of misfolded aSyn, an early step in its cell-to-cell transmission, remain
unresolved. Based on preliminary studies, our overarching hypothesis is that the binding of b-arrestin2 (bArr2)
to pS129-aSyn regulates membrane endocytosis and that the LMBRD2-bArr2 complex mediates the
internalization, transmission, and toxicity of pathological aSyn.
Utilizing cellular models and animal models combined with pathological, behavioral, electrophysiological,
biochemical, immunohistochemical, in situ protein-protein interaction, and unbiased proteomics studies, we will
validate, dissect, and elucidate the mechanistic basis of the bArr2-LMBRD2 pathway in the regulation of aSyn
function, accumulation, transmission, and toxicity."
10979056,"ABSTRACT
Congenital syphilis (CS) rates are rising exponentially in the United State. Syphilis in pregnancy is associated
with miscarriage, stillbirth, early infant death, low birth weight, and preterm birth. CS is also associated with
other neonatal finding, including skeletal abnormalities, skin rashes, vision and hearing loss, jaundice, severe
anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests in pregnancy, when
timely and adequate treatment is of crucial importance to reduce the risk of CS. Currently, syphilis diagnosis
relies on specific and non-specific serologic assays (treponemal and non-treponemal) that may be inadequate
to accurately distinguish between past infection, current infection, or reinfection. In the highest risk patients,
serology can be difficult to interpret due to lifelong persistence of treponemal antibodies in those with prior
syphilis, incomplete treatment histories, inadequate serologic response after treatment, and reinfection.
Furthermore, the current treatment regimen for late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration in pregnancy
is three weekly, intramuscular doses of penicillin, which is often challenging to administer in a timely manner in
the highest risk patients. Adequate response to treatment is determined by a 4-fold drop in non-treponemal
antibody titer in 3-6 months, which in clinical practice, may be after delivery of the infant depending on
gestational age of infection. A more time-sensitive biomarker of successful treatment during pregnancy would
have a great impact on resource utilization during pregnancy, and aid in the postnatal risk assessment of the
infant. Unbiased metabolomics and proteomics approaches have been increasingly applied to discover novel
biomarkers of disease status and prognosis, as well as treatment. Molecular-based testing for Treponema
pallidum antigens may also be a useful adjunct to traditional serologic testing, especially for more complex
clinical scenarios. These approaches have not been widely applied to syphilis in pregnancy. Here, we propose
to enroll a prospective cohort of pregnant patients with syphilis in Fresno, CA, where the rates of CS in Fresno
are 2.5-times higher than national averages. In the following Aims, we propose to analyze longitudinally
collected samples from pregnant patients diagnosed with syphilis to identify novel biomarkers of syphilis stage,
characterize the prevalence of T. pallidum in oral and vaginal samples at the time of diagnosis through the
application of a new nucleic acid amplification test, and identify proteomic biomarkers in maternal and infant
samples with confirmed CS. The overarching goal of these studies is to discover new candidate
molecules for novel diagnostic markers for syphilis in pregnancy and CS."
10982891,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are a significant human health burden around the world and are linked
with climate change in complex ways. In terms of vector biology, direct linkages can be made in the laboratory
setting between climate-related parameters and aspects of vector competence for pathogen transmission. In
the field, human behavioral responses to climate fluctuations can also directly impact vector control.
Understanding these relationships in the context of modeling traditional parameters and the interplay between
humans, animals, and the environment is critical to designing community-based interventions for vulnerable
populations.
 This is the second research project proposed as part of the P20 Center for Transformative Infectious
Disease Research on Climate, Health, and Equity in a Changing Environment (C-CHANGE). Here, we have
put together an international team (Cornell University, University of Pretoria, and Washington State University)
to combine expertise in vectors, pathogens, and climate change to lay the foundational groundwork for longer-
term studies by the C-CHANGE center on how climate and community practices affect public health,
specifically in the realm of climate-sensitive VBDs. Through this partnership, which will be built sustainably and
equitably with funding from the center, we will have access to field sites at the front lines of these issues in
addition to state-of-the art modeling and pathogen genomic technologies. We will draw on support from the
community engagement and data cores in order to integrate qualitative data in our models and set up
mechanisms to test the efficacy of future interventions.
 In Aim 1: mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) we will identify and analyze risk factors for malaria and
mosquito-borne arboviruses in collaboration with the UP Institute for Sustainable Malaria Control. Preliminary
modeling systems will be expanded to include epidemiological and vector ecology data towards development
of a model capable of predicting future trends at district, national and continental scales.
 In Aim 2: tick-borne diseases (TBD) we will leverage an ongoing project on infectious causes of acute
febrile illness in the Mnisi community, situated adjacent to the Kruger National Park in South Africa. At this site,
we will study the TBD pathogen dynamics between people and the animals they closely interact with in the
context of climate parameters and community demographics. We will use novel sequencing and computational
evolutionary approaches to identify signatures of zoonotic transmission that can be linked back to the climate-
related behaviors and leveraged for diagnostic development to directly benefit the community."
10982892,"Some of the greatest human health impacts from climate change are mediated by infectious diseases. Billions
are at risk annually from malaria alone, and viral pathogen spillover events and spread of vector-borne
diseases (VBD) are increasing due to climate change. In response to these urgent threats, Cornell University
and the University of Pretoria have newly partnered to create the Center for Transformative Infectious Disease
Research on Climate, Health, and Equity in a Changing Environment (C-CHANGE). To have the greatest
health impacts, we must change our research paradigms from reactively focusing on responding to outbreaks
to proactively understanding the complex social and environmental determinants that shape risk and promote
outbreaks. As a whole, C-CHANGE hypothesizes that community-engaged research that integrates human,
reservoir and vector behavior, climate, land-use, human and animal health, and vector/pathogen genomic
evolution datasets, will enable future creation of predictive epidemiological models and generation and rigorous
testing of preventative interventions. Working toward these goals, C-CHANGE’s Community Engagement Core
(CEC) will intersect with and support the aims of CHANGE’s Administrative Core, Living Evidence Data Core,
Project 1 Research Team (climate extremes and land use changes result in wildlife-to-human viral spillover
events), and Project 2 Research Team (community-based early warning system for climate-sensitive VBD can
promote human health), and will specifically work to foster collaborative, community-engaged research teams
that generate hypotheses and extend projects, and generate and use data to improve infectious disease
prevention and community resilience. The CEC will build upon robust community engagement seeded by C-
CHANGE members, and augment approaches and outcomes under the co-leadership of Meredith-ESI and van
Wyk. Over the next 3 years, to build reciprocal community engaged research relationships for the future, the
CEC will (1) Promote and enhance community engagement in guiding C-CHANGE’s work by establishing
community-imbedded action research partnerships, and creating standard processes and venues to support
communication of community ideas, issues, needs, and concerns to C-CHANGE’s members to inform and
guide research activities that address community needs; (2) Aid communities in using [C-CHANGE] data and
research to spur systems change by advancing partner communities’ scientific literacy in climate and one
health, including via sharing data and C-CHANGE research results into plain, action-focused language; and (3)
Establish benefits and scalability of the CEC approach by applying mixed methods developmental evaluation
to document processes, resource needs, outputs, and outcomes derived from CEC actions. Anticipated
outcomes include at least 6 active hypothesis-driven CBPR projects across 2 continents, and documentation of
expanded capacity and process/ systems change showing how research is being used by communities to
improve infectious diseases prevention, and resilience against the complex impacts of climate change."
10982893,"LEAD-MC SUMMARY
The impact of climate change on human health via disease transmission remains a key need for study, even as
other linkages between climate change and human health, like those of thermal extremes and air pollution, are
better understood. The linking pathway is complex--it incorporates climate, ecosystems, vector biology, disease
biology, and human biology and behavior—and requires both a systems approach and a need to de-silo different
fields. To help C-CHANGE meet its goal of creating predictive epidemiological models linking climate change
and disease transmission, we propose a Living Evidence and Applied Data Modeling Core (LEAD-MC), which
will de-silo the relevant and diverse fields and accelerate the building of transdisciplinary models. We will build
a federated database overlaid with integrated disease modeling, geospatial analysis, climate modeling,
econometrics and policy analysis, epidemiological modeling, and modern data management and analysis (living
evidence review, artificial intelligence, machine learning) to facilitate the creation of predictive epidemiological
models in C-CHANGE. The overarching goal of LEAD-MC is to build capacity and tools for transdisciplinary
research initially among C-CHANGE participants and collaborators. In the short term, LEAD-MC will facilitate the
achievement of overall C-CHANGE goals by de-siloing skillsets, datasets, and institutions. In the long term,
methods used in LEAD-MC can be applied elsewhere to accelerate actionable climate change-health impact
research. To achieve our goal, we have assembled a team representing diverse skillsets, geographic experience,
institutions, and career levels. The LEAD-MC team will leverage their diverse expertise in direct support of C-
CHANGE through a collaborative model and through organizing trainings with support from the Administrative
Core. LEAD-MC will also investigate new methods of curating relevant datasets and building integrative models.
Specifically, we will test two hypotheses: 1) that applying the living-evidence model of systematic review will
improve the applicability of research products; 2)that methods of artificial intelligence, epidemiology, and
econometrics provide a framework for integrating data streams to generate actionable data and research.Each
member of the team is an expert in their field and some level of interdisciplinary collaboration, but LEAD-MC will
enable all members to gain experience working in a transdisciplinary setting. Expertise includes disease
modeling (Bento), geospatial analysis (Hayden, ESI), climate modeling (Jacobson), living evidence review
(Kibbee, ESI), artificial intelligence (Marivate, ESI; Pavicic, ESI), statistics (Ntozini), econometrics and policy
analysis (Sanders), and epidemiological modeling (Smith, ESI). We will also leverage already-collected data
contributed by other LEAD-MC members (Chaisi) and C-CHANGE collaborators, including human- and wildlife-
health datasets including genomic libraries, remote sensing data, and biobanked human and animal samples.
Additional members can be added to the LEAD-MC effort during the project as well. LEAD-MC function is
supported by world-class research facilities including data storage and computation."
10982894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in model organisms such as mice and rats have
identified hundreds of genetic loci that are associated with addictive behaviors, but determining the causal
genes remains challenging. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may not adequately tag other classes
of variants such as structural and repetitive variants that have higher mutation rates. Thus, both panels of
inbred strains and outbred populations will fail to identify a subset of loci and causal alleles. We are
proposing to address this serious limitation by using cutting-edge methods to discover and genotype
structural variants (SVs) and tandem repeats (TRs). Because they are technically challenging to analyze,
SVs and TRs have not yet been adequately surveyed in rodents. However, there is already extensive
evidence that SVs and TRs are prevalent in mice and rats, and that they have important functional
consequences. Our proposal brings together complementary expertise in human genetics and bioinformatic
analysis of SVs (Sebat) and repetitive variation (Gymrek) with established leadership in elucidating the
genetic basis of behavioral phenotypes in model organisms (Palmer). This study will generate the first
large-scale resource for analyzing the effects of complex variation on mouse and rat phenotypes. We use
this resource to examine gene expression and behavioral traits in inbred mice (BXD recombinant inbred
strains, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), the Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, the Hybrid Rat
Diversity Panel (HRDP) and the Heterogeneous Stock (HS) outbred rats.
 In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize SVs in inbred and outbred mice and rats by single-molecule
sequencing. In Specific Aim 2 we will genotype TR in inbred and outbred mice and rats. Finally, in
Specific Aim 3 we will perform GWAS using SV and TR for gene expression and behavioral traits. We will
determine the phenotypic consequences of the SV and TR genotypes on gene expression and behavioral
traits. We will impute SVs and TRs into outbred mice and rats and then perform GWAS using the wealth of
preexisting gene expression and behavioral data that are available for the mouse and rat populations
studied in this project. Completion of this project will characterize the SV and TR landscape in mice and
rats, elucidate their role in gene expression and complex behavioral traits relevant to addiction, and create
a community resource that will enhance numerous ongoing mouse and rat genetic studies."
10984410,"Abstract
Early poverty and lower education attainment are associated with increased rates of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), and lower cognitive functioning in later adulthood. Upwardly mobile youth who
“strive” to rise above poverty typically have better cognitive outcomes in early adulthood.
However, our preliminary data suggest that striving during adolescence can be stressful,
particularly for females. Such stress may result in altered brain-gut axis signaling and systemic
inflammation, which could set the stage for AD pathophysiology to begin unfolding before its
onset in older adulthood. Women are at greater risk for striving-related stress, stress-related
health problems, and critically, when they possess other AD risk factors such as
apolipoprotein-ε4 (ApoE-ε4) gene status, they are more likely to develop AD. We hypothesize
that due to sex-specific vulnerabilities (such as stress) females, but not males, with
greater mobility opportunity will exhibit more physical health risks (namely obesity and
inflammation as well as altered gut microbiome profiles) in early adulthood, which will in
turn be negatively associated with cognitive outcomes and brain structure/function. We
will test this hypothesis in a cohort of young adults (now age 23) who have participated in the
Reducing Inequities through Social and Educational Change Follow-up (RISE-Up) Study since
2003. RISE-Up is a natural experiment using the admissions lottery of several high-performing
public charter high schools to identify comparable groups of adolescents “randomized” into high-
(mobility opportunity) and lower-performing (static) schools. The RISE-Up study provides a
unique chance to better understand how adolescent mobility opportunities differentially influence
adult cognitive health and AD risk in females and males. To this end, we will pursue three aims:
(1) Identify the impact of mobility opportunity on young adult general cognitive ability (which we
propose will link with later life resilience to AD), and test sex as a moderator; (2) Establish links
between mobility opportunity, inflammatory markers, and microbiome functional potential, and
determine whether those links are moderated by sex. Additionally, we will test whether sex and
ApoE-ε4 status interact to predict inflammatory markers and microbiome functional potential; (3)
Delineate associations between health (inflammatory markers, microbiome functional potential)
and brain structure/function in early adulthood, probe their associations with general cognitive
ability, and examine sex is a moderator."
10984412,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Sensorimotor function is aberrant in psychosis, with 60-80% of patients being affected and motor disturbances
contributing to hospitalizations. One sensorimotor function is motor learning, which allows us to engage with
and adapt to our world through generating and updating internal models. Deficits in model updating are linked
to symptoms in psychosis, such as delusions, hallucination, negative symptoms, and disorganization, making
this fundamental process key to understanding the disorder. My prior work shows that sensorimotor and
cognitive cerebellar regions required for model updating processes are smaller in a subset of patients, which
may account for variability within and across motor tasks as well as symptom heterogeneity in psychosis.
Critical knowledge gaps in these brain-behavior-symptom relationships have limited our ability to leverage the
motor system for intervention, despite it being a highly accessible system. Thus, fundamental sensorimotor
subprocesses are key to understanding psychosis and determining viable targets for treatment. Using
longitudinal approaches and cross-discipline advances in measurement that allow us to parse
previously ignored or indistinguishable sensorimotor processes, this project will determine how
sensorimotor aberrations and psychotic symptoms relate, to inform mechanistic models and future
intervention research. This K23 mentored patient-oriented career development award employs a novel
computerized motor learning task and neuroimaging. The project goals are to: (Aim 1) cross-sectionally
localize aberrant subprocesses of motor learning in psychosis and link these processes to brain structure and
symptoms; (Aim 2) longitudinally map the malleability of sensorimotor deficits during natural course of illness
to identify viable, clinically relevant intervention targets. This work sets the foundation for robust mechanistic
studies on the role of unique neural circuits in distinct sensorimotor subprocesses and the data may serve as
primary and secondary outcomes to investigate entirely new avenues of treatment for psychosis, given the lack
of intervention on this system (planned follow-up R-mechanism grant). The applicant is an tenure-track
Assistant Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington with dual PhD in
Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience. She holds expertise in sensorimotor processes and cerebellar
neuroimaging in psychosis. Her long-term career goal is to be a recognized expert on sensorimotor function in
psychosis and to develop a mechanistic model of sensorimotor disturbance in psychosis that can be leveraged
for clinical assessment and intervention. To accomplish these goals, the applicant will expand her current
expertise with training in computational psychiatry, longitudinal methods, and intervention science for
translation of targets to viable treatments. Training will include formal coursework and hands-on training,
guided by a mentorship team of experts in these domains. Mentored training and completion of this project will
provide the necessary skills, experience, and data to launch a successful independent research career."
10984576,"SUMMARY: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) disease burden is anticipated to affect
diverse ethnic and racial groups disproportionately with the most staggering increase of nearly 6-fold impacting
Hispanics. Nonetheless, there is a lack of scientific research on Hispanic adults, particularly among the most
populous Mexican American (MA) demographic, fostering a poor understanding of the mechanisms contributing
to the observed disparities. Tau deposition is strongly linked to cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized in
vivo with sensitive and specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracers such as 18F-MK-6240. Data from
our team and others indicates that artificial intelligence (AI) methods that quantify tau deposition patterns specific
to AD may optimize detection of early disease risk and better predict cognitive decline. Unfortunately, few studies
have been conducted in diverse cohorts, which limits generalizability and may precipitate further inequities in AD
diagnosis and treatment. In addition, gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of mixed dementia
pathologies on cognition. AD and cerebrovascular (CVD) commonly co-occur, and may have a larger impact on
disease presentation in MA adults relative to non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults due to socio-economic disparities
and broader social determinants of health (SDoH) that increase cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). We now
propose to develop and validate traditional and novel tau PET imaging and CVD measures in longitudinal cohort
of 500 MA older adults (N=150 cognitively unimpaired (CU), N=150 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), N=200 AD
dementia) from the South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Nantz National Alzheimer's
Center. We will assess the diagnostic accuracy of traditional and AI-derived tau PET indices and examine their
associations with longitudinal cognitive decline (Aim 1). We also evaluate associations between the tau PET
measures and ADRD plasma biomarkers in order to facilitate efforts to utilize blood-based biomarkers for initial
diagnostic screening and clinical trial stratification. Next, we will evaluate the interactive effects of tau and CVD
burden on cognition and will employ causal interference modeling to elucidate the pathways linking SDoH and
modifiable CVRFs with ADRD (Aim 2). Leveraging the resource of harmonized clinical and neuroimaging data
on 200 NHW adults from the Nantz National Alzheimer's Center, we will examine the hypothesis that ethnic
disparities in ADRD will be mediated through these pathways. Finally, we will validate our imaging and plasma
biomarker findings in an independent sample of 1,000 Hispanic and 1,000 NHW older adults participating in the
community-based HABS-HD study (Aim 3). Our proposal will provide important insights into the diagnostic
accuracy of traditional and novel tau PET measures. We will further examine the overlay of tau pathology with
broader ADRD neuroimaging and blood biomarkers in an effort to advance the understanding of ADRD
heterogeneity and optimize early disease detection. Finally, we systematically evaluate the underlying pathways
linking SDoH and modifiable CVRFs with ADRD, which may be leveraged to attenuate health disparities.

10984102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) experience accelerated declines in cognition resulting in
dementia within 1 year or complete incapacitation within 2 years of symptom onset. Although the medical
literature has long emphasized the contributions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to RPD, rapidly progressive forms
of Alzheimer disease and AD-related dementias (rpAD/ADRD) account for most cases of RPD in older
individuals. The rapid rate of decline in patients with rpAD/ADRD presents a great clinical challenge for the
assessing clinician but also a unique opportunity to study the biological factors that underlie this extreme
endophenotype across a shortened symptomatic period. The Biomarkers and Rates of Progression in Dementia
(Bio-RaPID) study will capitalize on this opportunity by enrolling and evaluating 120 patients with rpAD/ADRD.
Recruitment will be supported by a 9-site referral network engaging 7 Alzheimer Disease Research Centers with
expertise in recruitment of underrepresented groups. Structured clinical evaluations will be conducted at
baseline, 12-, and 24-months at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (FL) or Rochester (MN). Interval telemedicine
assessments with remote blood collection at 3- and 6-months will minimize participant burden while enabling
serial measures of cognitive function and blood-based biomarkers. In this way, Bio-RaPID will combine clinical
expertise, validated diagnostic approaches, long-read whole genome sequencing, and gold-standard in vivo
measures of amyloid (A: CSF ptau181/Aβ42), tau (T: flortaucipir PET), neurodegeneration (N: MRI),
cerebrovascular disease (V: MRI), pathologic aggregates of α-synuclein (CSF seed amplification assay), and
biofluid biomarkers of neuroinflammation to determine the patient- and disease-specific factors that contribute to
rpAD/ADRD. Use of ADRC protocols and coordination with ADRC Cores will enable comparison with existing
patients with typical AD/ADRD and broad sharing of Bio-RaPID data. This “whole patient, whole brain” approach
will inform the influence of patient-specific factors on rpAD/ADRD susceptibility, including age, sex, medical
history, structural and social determinants of health, genetic variants, and ATN(V) and α-synuclein pathology
(Aim 1); and the contributions of disease-specific factors to disease progression, including burden and topology
of neuropathology and the mediating effects of neuroinflammation (Aim 2). Finally, Bio-RaPID will leverage
unbiased proteomic analyses in CSF from an independent cohort of patients with autopsy-confirmed rapid and
typical AD/ADRD (n=120, each) to validate findings from Aim 1 and 2 and identify cellular/protein pathways that
are uniquely expressed or altered in rpAD/ADRD (Aim 3). Bio-RaPID aims will inform the cumulative contributions
of demographics, concurrent health issues, structural and social determinants of health, genetics, biofluid
biomarkers, and ATN(V) neuropathology to cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction in rpAD/ADRD. In turn,
these findings will be extended to identify biomarkers and novel treatment targets with the potential to arrest or
slow pathologic progression in patients with rapid and typical progressive AD/ADRD."

The precision and accuracy of vertebrate movement is mediated by the cerebellum. Cerebellar damage results
in a signature motor phenotype called dysmetria, characterized by prominent endpoint errors in movements
such as reaches. These endpoint deficits have been attributed to the absence of anticipatory braking signals
from the cerebellar interposed nucleus that accurately slow the limb to target. Our previous work in mice has
shown a causal role for activity in the interposed nucleus that scales the rate of reach deceleration relative to
peak reach velocity, producing stable endpoints despite reach-by-reach kinematic variability. We hypothesize
that this activity is learned and under adaptive control from Purkinje neurons and the inferior olive (IO):
Reaches that end off target will alter the frequency of teaching signals from the IO, reweight contextual signals
to Purkinje cells, and recalibrate interposed deceleration signals such that future reaching attempts land on
target. Despite this developing framework, the interposed nucleus houses multiple projection neuron types,
including inhibitory neurons that project densely to the IO, termed nucleoolivary neurons (NO). This proposal
uses our unique behavioral paradigm of closed-loop circuit manipulations to advance the cerebellar learning
hypothesis by asking how the cerebellum tunes its own teaching signals via this inhibitory output pathway and
actuates control with these neurons. Together these projections raise the intriguing possibility that the
cerebellum teaches its teachers. The outcomes of these studies will advance our long-term goal of
understanding the circuit mechanisms of feedforward motor control in mammals, which is critical for precise
movement and hypothesized to be impaired in movement disorders that involve the cerebellum."

10984736,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the US and worldwide. Decades of endeavors in
studying cardiovascular disease have led to a substantial understanding of underlying mechanisms, but there is
still much to be learned. Cardiovascular homeostasis is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional
levels, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that RNA posttranscriptional modifications, such as
alternative RNA splicing, play essential roles in regulating cardiac function and disease. A previous study by the
applicant (Dr. Peiheng Gan) has revealed that RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) is crucial for
cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart development through modulating alternative RNA splicing. In the new
study, the applicant found that RBPMS is required for adult cardiac contractility. The absence of RBPMS impaired
cardiomyocyte contractility and impacted the splicing of various sarcomeric genes, which displayed distinct
patterns. Cardiac RBPMS expression was decreased in patients with heart failure and doxorubicin-induced heart
failure in animal models. Intriguingly, the overexpression of RBPMS showed protective effects on contractility
and survival in doxorubicin-treated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).
Together, these data suggest that RBPMS is a key regulator of adult heart function and heart failure progression.
During the K99 phase of this proposal (Aim 1), the applicant will characterize how RBPMS regulates
cardiomyocyte contraction through modulating RNA splicing using both mouse models and hiPSC-CMs. In Aim
2, the applicant will leverage cellular and molecular tools to characterize the functional interactions between
RBPMS and other cardiac RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including RBM20 and RBFOX1. This study provides
the applicant with a unique opportunity to investigate how different RBPs interact to regulate cardiac function
and alternative RNA splicing. During the R00 phase (Aim 3), the applicant will explore the therapeutic potential
of overexpressing RBPMS in doxorubicin-induced mouse heart failure and determine the molecular mechanisms
of RBPMS-mediated protective effects. The completion of the proposed study will provide critical insights into
the posttranscriptional regulation of cardiac function by RBPs and create new opportunities for curing
cardiovascular disease.
The applicant will acquire crucial knowledge and skills by studying RBPs and RNA posttranscriptional
modifications during his K99 phase to complement his previous expertise in cardiovascular research. Additionally,
the applicant’s career development will be enhanced by the expertise of an exceptional mentoring and advisory
committee, as well as the unparalleled resources and ample educational and training opportunities at UT
Southwestern Medical Center, a world-class research institution. The outstanding mentoring, unmatched
resources, and strong commitment from his department will strengthen the applicant’s candidacy for and
transition to an independent tenure-track faculty position."

 Climate change health risks can be reduced through mitigation and adaptation interventions, with research
required to determine which interventions to prioritize where, and how to implement them rapidly, effectively,
and at scale. The goal of the Implementation and Evaluation (I&E) Core of the REACH Center is to support
investigator-driven research that leverages implementation science to understand and improve the uptake of
evidence-informed innovations that reduce the health consequences of climate change at scale, including in
public health practice, healthcare and community settings. The I&E Core will work with academicians, as well
as public health, healthcare and community implementers, to achieve its goal through a combination of
peer-to-peer learning, training, and co-production of climate-relevant implementation science projects.
 The University of Washington REACH Center is ideally situated to link implementation science research
with public health and healthcare organizations in the region. Our faculty is at the forefront in defining
multidisciplinary, implementation science research methods, and has developed novel training curricula in
public health, healthcare and implementation science. Furthermore, REACH-affiliated investigators lead
diverse programs to implement and scale-up health innovations. To support the overall goals of the REACH
Center, the I&E Core proposes a package of high value training and community of practice opportunities, as
well as technical consultations on implementation science, to lead to new and innovative research, and
ultimately improve the speed, efficiency, and quality of efforts to translate scientific evidence on reducing the
health consequences of climate change into effective, large scale health programs.
 The I&E Core’s specific aims are to: 1) Develop a cohort of climate and health I&E Fellows to assess
contextual determinants, successful implementation strategies, and/or implementation outcomes of
evidence-informed climate and health interventions; and 2) provide training and technical assistance for
researchers on implementation science in climate change and health. Under aim 1 we will pilot an 18-month
I&E fellowship program that will recruit and engage teams of academicians, regional public health practitioners,
healthcare leaders, and/or community-based organizational leaders who will work in tandem with Core faculty
to design and implement a climate change and health implementation science project. Under aim 2 we will
adapt an intensive implementation science training institute to include climate change and health content and
will support attendees at this course; will host quarterly webinars on the intersection of implementation science,
climate change and health research; and will provide technical consultations for emerging and established
investigators on implementation science methods."
10982296,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL
The threat of climate change and urgency for large-scale preventive mitigation policies are now broadly
recognized and supported by calls for a rapid and comprehensive energy transition. Major climate policies,
however, are emerging without consideration of the near-term human health or equity implications. Missing is
the evidence base required to guide specific policy decisions that would maximize health and equity
benefits while also reducing further warming of the planet. The overarching goal of the proposed Health-
First Climate Action Research Center is to catalyze rigorous, innovative, community-driven, policy-relevant,
transdisciplinary research aimed at understanding the health and equity impacts of specific energy choices as
the US strives to reach a low-carbon energy transition. Achieving this goal requires engagement across
community, scientific, and policy sectors and defines the theme of our proposal, “A Community-Driven, Health-
First Approach to Climate Action and the Energy Transition.” We posit that a “health-first” approach to climate
decision-making will increase both distributive and procedural equity associated with specific policy solution
pathways proposed for climate mitigation. Our key innovation is in developing and employing a linked pathway
that starts and ends with communities as it generates robust estimates of the health impacts of contemplated
climate change actions. Innovations in community engagement will include: participatory web-based
technologies, including web-based mapping and storytelling, crowd-sourcing and artificial intelligence, and
utilization of low-cost air pollution monitors, which are increasingly being used by citizen scientists and
communities. Innovations coming from our primary research project will include development of a new, high-
resolution Scenario Health Risk for Energy model to support decision-making by policy makers and community
partners, balancing representation of complex processes with the speed and ease-of-use required for public
utilization. We also will conduct a Pilot Target Trial to assess the likely impacts of climate change action on
asthma burden of Milwaukee public school children. The proposed Data Science Core will prioritize authentic,
multi-directional, equitable community engagement and data sharing. Innovations will stem from: establishing a
Data Repository that will foster team science and provide a single point of access for all stakeholders; creating
a Data Commons that provides linkage, integration, mapping, metadata management, and computerized
routines for reusable data, metadata, and software artifacts for collaborative research and data sharing; and
providing Digital Engagement tools using advanced technologies (e.g., natural language processing) to ensure
that community voices are utilized efficiently to inform research and policy development. Our Wisconsin-based
community, government, and university environments have the track record, expertise, foundations, and
institutional support for high productivity and policy impact of this Health-First Climate Action Research Center."

The overarching goal of the Health-First Climate Action Research Center, a Wisconsin-based Climate Change
and Health Research Center (CCHRC), is to catalyze rigorous, innovative, community-driven, policy-relevant,
transdisciplinary research on health and equity impacts of specific energy choices as the US strives to reach a
low-carbon energy transition. Achieving this goal requires effective coordination and communication, evaluation,
and a plan for sustainability beyond the initial 3-year funding period. The Administrative Core will serve that
need by coordinating, administrating, evaluating, and sustaining all components and processes of the CCHRC.
This goal will be achieved through five Specific Aims: (1) Coordinate interaction and integration across the Cores,
Research Projects, and activities of the Center, (2) Create an effective administrative structure for successful
governance and clear decision-making, (3) Establish and administer a Pilot Grants Program to support pilot
initiatives and expand research capacity, (4) Establish and convene a transdisciplinary, cross-sector External
Advisory Committee to guide overall direction and strategic decision-making, and (5) Conduct thorough and
iterative evaluation of all activities, processes, outcomes, and impacts of the research center, with a focus on
equitable community engagement, transdisciplinary integration, and a health-first approach. The
Administrative Core team includes a Director and Deputy Director, both accomplished leaders in climate change
and health research with extensive leadership experience; a co-investigator with experience in air pollutant
impacts on children; and staff with expertise in transdisciplinary team science, community engagement,
evaluation, climate science communication, and team coordination. Administrative Core team members will
leverage several innovative strengths to increase the capacity and impact of the CCHRC, including distributed
leadership across academic institutions and community and policy groups; integration of diverse perspectives
through activities such as voting rights to community members regarding the Center’s activities and direction; a
multisector, transdisciplinary approach that integrates and builds upon expertise across disciplines and sectors;
and structures such as the Pilot Grants Program, External Advisory Committee, Evaluation Partnership Team,
and Community Advisory Board to maximize the team’s ability to conduct and disseminate results of innovative,
meaningful, policy-relevant research. The Administrative Core team will support, facilitate, and evaluate
research aimed at maximizing health and equity impacts of energy and transportation policies and choices. All
administrative activities will include processes and plans for multidirectional communication and learning that
enable iterative improvement and midcourse correction when needed. Through these activities and structures,
the Administrative Core will promote integration across scientific disciplines, community partners, and
collaborating institutions to facilitate maximum effectiveness of this innovative, community-engaged, equity-
driven, transdisciplinary CCHRC."
10982298,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT
Urgent actions to address climate change are clearly needed, as climate threats to human health are extensive,
formidable, and growing. Policies to reduce energy emissions are geared to mitigate climate change by reducing
greenhouse gas (GH) emissions. While these strategies can also deliver health “co-benefits,” especially from
improving air quality, health is usually not prioritized, and only considered generally in aggregate, without taking
into account localized effects, and with little or no input from the community. The goal of the proposed NIH Health-
First Climate Action Research Center is to provide research-based evidence and guidance to maximize health
and equity benefits while reducing GHG emissions. The research project of the Center flips the usual
analytical frame for climate-health analysis by introducing a community-driven health-equity approach
to identify health-focused energy solutions while addressing disparities in air pollution exposures.
Working with the Community Engagement Core and Milwaukee-based community partners, the proposed
Research Project will develop a comprehensive menu of technology and policy options to support health, clean
air, and climate mitigation, and transform these into specific policy scenarios for community review and
development. The project will also develop and evaluate a new, high-resolution reduced-form modeling
framework, the Scenario Health Risk for Energy (SHRE, pronounced as “share”) model, to support the design
and implementation of evidence-based health and climate interventions proposed by and co-developed with
community partners. This model will merge best practices to quantify fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Including ambient local pollutant
concentrations, this model will be used to evaluate specific health impacts from both short- and long-term
exposures, with consideration of environmental justice impacts, for use when developing the community-driven
policy scenarios. To support action-oriented solutions, this research project will also quantify the GHG emissions
reductions for each of the policy priorities, using full lifecycle assessment methodology. Community-engaged
social and equity impact tracing techniques will be used to identify interventions impacting a broader set of equity-
relevant metrics (e.g., access, affordability, mobility, etc.). These results will be shared and refined in an iterative
process using quantitative and qualitative data from digital crowdsourcing to complement community-based
individual and group interviews under guidance from the Center’s Community Advisory Board. We also will utilize
tools to share the multidimensional impacts of health-first policies, working with our Data Science Core toward
developing effective data visualizations and knowledge sharing protocols to engage with our community
partners. This project will thus be able to identify climate change actions with the greatest positive health
and equity effects, and is designed for immediate translational impact with the potential to scale to other
regions."

strives to reach a low-carbon energy transition. In support of this objective, the goal of the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) is to ensure that Milwaukee communities most impacted by energy choices and climate
change, as well as community-based organizations that promote environmental justice, exert a meaningful, long-
term influence on the development and direction of the Center and benefit from its research, policy engagement
and capacity building activities. The CEC draws upon existing strengths and partnerships, a set of core values
and effective and innovative community engagement strategies to accomplish this goal. Specific Aims are: (1)
Establish and build power with an active Community Advisory Board (CAB) to ensure that Center priorities,
activities and investments align with and are responsive to community goals for climate action and health equity
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, (2) Build the Center’s capacity in community engaged data science to engage new
audiences, leverage community-generated knowledge and data, and utilize innovative technologies and
communication strategies to maximize the potential impact for community-driven climate policy solutions, (3)
Establish multidirectional communication among Center researchers and communities most impacted by energy
choices and climate change to ensure that Center research is strongly aligned with community priorities and
research findings are effectively communicated to diverse audiences, and (4) Evaluate the Center’s community
engagement activities to ensure that power is balanced between community and academic partners, that
necessary course corrections and new directions are implemented expediently, and that community engagement
processes and outcomes meet established metrics for authentic, reciprocal community-academic partnerships.
The vision of the CEC is a Center where community and academic partners share influence and benefit to
achieve common goals of climate change mitigation and reduction of local environmental health inequities. If the
proposed aims are achieved, we anticipate realizing this vision and maximizing the positive impact of this new
Center for Milwaukee communities long impacted by environmental injustice."
10982300,"PROJECT SUMMARY - DATA SCIENCE CORE
Significance: Effective climate change actions are hampered by a lack of transdisciplinary and community-
informed data, fragmented health surveillance systems, and insufficient local and regional climate data.
Community engagement is pivotal for meaningful data collection and effective policy change, yet challenges
arise from the digital divide. An integrative data approach, and advanced data science methods, such as 'climate
computing', can address these complexities and lead to effective and sustainable climate–health policies and
ensure their adoption with community involvement. Innovation: Central to our Data Science Core (DSC) is a
groundbreaking initiative: the union of data science with deep, reciprocal community interaction. Our team aims
to embed community feedback into every facet of research, including data collection, synthesis, and
dissemination of results. Historically, community-focused research and bioinformatics have been distinct fields.
This initiative strives to bridge the gap by “bringing the power of data to all the stakeholders.” Our proposed
approach includes: 1) a revolutionary, crowdsourced, community-based data collection system, in which data is
relevant and actionable, 2) a holistic approach to data integration, combining diverse disciplines, 3) advanced
data analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and 4) effective communication of
results to all stakeholders, including community, academia, government, and public. Our team has extensive
experience in developing and applying analytical techniques and public interfaces that can enrich research
projects facilitated by the Center. Building upon prior work of community-engaged data science from national to
local scales, the proposed research activities will consist of three primary aims: 1) Community Integration with
Data which underscores the importance of embedding community feedback into our data foundations. The DSC
will develop state-of-the-art informatics tools to effectively engage communities, including, an AI-assisted tool
translating findings into digestible insights for the wider public, 2) Real-World Data Commons which revolves
around the creation of a prototype integrating community insights with multifaceted data on climate, policy, and
health. It will also serve as a public resource, providing scripts, datasets, and visualization tools that ensures
community voices are central, through collaboration with the Community Engagement Core, and 3) Analytical
Support which provides robust analytics for the center's various projects. This includes advanced air quality
monitoring and modeling, with integration of ML to enhance forecasting accuracy. Overall impact: The DSC’s
proposed infrastructure is poised to set a precedent whereby it serves as a national blueprint for climate policy
researchers. Adhering NIH data sharing principles, this infrastructure will act as a comprehensive repository for
diverse data on climate policy and health. The ultimate vision of DSC is to harness cutting-edge and equity-
centered data science tools and insights to guide the development of policies aimed at countering the adverse
effects of climate change on public health, benefiting not just the state of Wisconsin, but the nation and globe."
10982352,"Here we seek to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic modeling of cerebral aneurysms. This goal of this
project is to predict the outcome of cerebral aneurysm treatment. This is significant due to the prevalence of
cerebral aneurysms, their dismal prognosis when ruptured, and treatment failure rates (resulting in aneurysm
recurrence and risk of either brain hemorrhage or need for retreatment) of up to 40%. Hemodynamic forces are
thought to influence aneurysm treatment outcomes, and can be simulated using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methods, but such studies have not been widely accepted due to conflicting results. Traditional CFD
analysis (termed “Eulerian” metrics) only studies the effect of blood flow on the vascular walls, largely ignoring
circulating blood products such as platelets that initiate intra-aneurysmal thrombosis (termed “Lagrangian”
metrics), which have a critical role in treatment outcome. Better prediction through a holistic approach
combining both types of analyses could identify patients at risk for treatment failure, influencing pre-surgical
decision-making.
 This project builds on our ongoing NIH-funded expertise (via a renewal of R01NS105692) in the CFD
modeling of cerebral aneurysms before and after treatment. We have developed an innovative method of
incorporating novel Lagrangian metrics, such as residence time and shear history, into CFD simulations in with
existing Eulerian hemodynamic metrics, to create a holistic approach to modeling the effects of aneurysm
treatment. Feasibility studies have characterized the post-treatment hemodynamic environment with special
attention to platelet-representative particles that experience prolonged intra-aneurysmal residence time and
low cumulative shear history within treated aneurysms. Previous in vitro studies of platelets in similar
conditions demonstrate thrombosis in such environments, which would be advantageous after aneurysm
treatment to develop a stable thrombus leading to aneurysm healing.
 First, we will perform CFD simulations before and after treatment on a cohort of cerebral aneurysms
whose treatment outcome (success or failure) is known. We will include both Eulerian and Lagrangian metrics
to determine associations with treatment outcome. Second, we will use an established animal model of
cerebral aneurysms, treated with commercially-available endovascular devices. We will perform CFD
simulations a similar holistic model as the human aneurysm cohort, and investigate the relationship between
Lagrangian metrics and treatment-related thrombosis on histological analysis. The final result will be an
optimized CFD methodology and set of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables predictive of outcome after cerebral
aneurysm embolization."

The Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR) requests funds to purchase a Leica ARTOS
Ultramicrotome for sample preparation for Electron Microscopy (EM). CISR is an institutional, fee-for-
service, advanced microscopy resource. The CISR provides researchers with access to state-of-the-art
imaging equipment which includes a modern FIB-SEM and TEM. CISR provides full-service electron
microscopy sample preparation including sample embedding, thick and thin sectioning, staining, and
image acquisition for either SEM or TEM. These instruments and services are available to support any
investigator with an appointment at Vanderbilt University or Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The
CISR serves over 200 labs per year, and processes approximately 1,000 SEM and TEM samples per year.
Manual serial sectioning for 3-D image reconstruction is currently an error prone, labor and time
intensive process that slows down work flow. The Leica ARTOS will allow automated serial sectioning of
cells and tissues for downstream array tomography and serial tomography transmission electron
microscopy applications. The ARTOS can automatically cut tissue serial sections between 50-100 nm
with an advanced set of features to enable collection of hundreds of sections without error. These
features include automated ribbon sectioning with horizontal movements at a set number of sections, a
specialized cutting knife that can hold and cut sections for an entire coverslip, a mechanism to recover
all these sections without introducing wrinkles, and a vibration and acoustic isolation platform to
facilitate section reproducibility. These serial sections will be used for tissue reconstructions of up to
100,000 µm3 volume at nanometer resolution. This is not currently possible with the equipment at
Vanderbilt.
If funded the Leica ARTOS would be incorporated into the CISR workflow run by our expert CISR staff.
Dr. Evan Krystofiak manages the CISR electron microscopy staff including Maria Vinogradova. Both Evan
and Maria are experts in ultramicrotomy and regularly prepare thin and thick sections on the CISR’s
existing Leica ultramicrotomes, including manually prepared, short serial section ribbons. The requested
Leica ARTOS would be housed in existing CISR space in RR-1207 MCN along with current CISR-EM sample
preparation equipment. In summary, acquisition of the Leica ARTOS will allow for unprecedented
volumetric imaging capabilities of biological samples at scales and spatial resolutions not currently
available to Vanderbilt and will facilitate research on a diverse set of NIH funded research."
10987640,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intimate partner violence (IPV), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) are highly
co-occurring conditions. Up to 94% of individuals using opioids report current or past IPV, and 64% of individuals
with IPV meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. There are increasing calls for all people to be screened for IPV across
healthcare settings. However, to date, there are no well-established evidence-based screening, assessment,
and referral programs for IPV or its consequences, such as PTSD, in opioid treatment programs (OTPs).
Validated assessments and evidenced-based care programs—such as violence shelters and PTSD
treatments—exist; however, current data show valid assessment tools may not be routinely implemented in OTP
settings and that treatment providers in these settings may not feel confident in their ability to assess and refer
for IPV and related issues. The proposed study directly addresses this major clinical gap by testing whether the
development and implementation of a digital, decision-support toolkit for IPV and co-occurring mental health
conditions will increase standard screening for IPV, uptake of referrals, improve clinic workflows, and enhance
clinical outcomes. The proposed study includes three separate aims, two in the R61 phase and a stepped-wedge
randomized trial in the R33 phase. In Aim 1 (R61), informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research, we will conduct stakeholder interviews with providers, IPV advocacy specialists, and IPV survivors to
inform the development of the digital toolkit to assess for IPV, PTSD, and associated conditions in OTPs. An
iterative process of design for the digital toolkit will be employed. The decision-support algorithms will be
developed to enhance automation of referrals following assessments. In Aim 2 (R61), we will beta test the digital
toolkit with 12 provider-patient dyads in each participating OTP and further refine the digital toolkit. Go/No-Go
criteria for the R33 phase will include quantitative and qualitative thresholds of acceptability, feasibility,
appropriateness, and usability of the toolkit based on data provided from beta testers. If criteria are met, in Aim
3 (R33), we will apply the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
framework to evaluate the digital toolkit in a randomized stepped-wedge, hybrid implementation-effectiveness
type II design among N=780 individuals with OUD seeking care at one of the three OTPs in South Carolina. Drs.
Jarnecke and Saraiya (MPIs) have assembled a team of renowned investigators with expertise in OUD, IPV,
PTSD, clinical trials, digital interventions, and dissemination and implementation science. Findings could
transform clinical practice by enhancing standard screening, assessment, and referral of IPV and associated
conditions, and reduce IPV, PTSD, and OUD in the state of South Carolina, which has one of the highest rates
of IPV in the U.S."
10988065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lewy Body Diseases (LBD), which include Parkinson's Disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB),
represents a spectrum of progressive, debilitating neurological disorders for which there is no cure. Emerging
evidence indicates that for some individuals with LBD and those with prodromal LBD (pLBD), including those
with isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD), peripheral organs are involved including the gut.
Furthermore, peripheral insults including alterations to the gut microbiota, immune dysregulation, and toxin
exposure have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, few studies have provided comprehensive
characterization of pathologic, immunologic, microbiologic and physiologic parameters in patients with PD or
iRBD thereby precluding definitive conclusions about the role peripheral organs have in pathobiology and
disease signatures. The proposed multidisciplinary study will integrate novel technologies and
concepts exploring the interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system in the
pathogenesis of LBD. We have found that a population of gut macrophages (MΦs) residing in the enteric
nervous system (ENS), an autonomous branch of the peripheral nervous system that spans the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, shares genetic and functional characteristics with microglia, the predominant brain
MΦ population critical to both pathogenesis and prevention of neurodegenerative disease. We identified
clearance of α-synuclein (α-SYN) aggregates, the pathologic hallmark of LBD, as a homeostatic function of
these MΦs. We propose a novel paradigm whereby the gut microbiome influences neurodegenerative disease
through immune mechanisms. We hypothesize that altered gut neuro-immune interactions, mediated by
microbial derived factors, promotes LBD progression. We will test this hypothesis through the following Aims:
Aim 1 will use a multi-modal approach to characterized peripheral involvement in PD, iRBD and healthy
controls. Our analysis will include use of (i) a novel wearable HR-EGG-EEG device to interrogate gut-brain
function, (ii) seed amplification assay on biopsy tissue to investigate enteric Lewy pathology, (iii) fecal analysis
to evaluate microbiota structure/function, and (iv) characterization of immune response with flow cytometry,
NanoString analysis, and immunoassays on colon biopsies and paired serum. Aim 2 will assess whether the
microbiota promotes LBD by gut immune mechanisms. We will directly test stool collected in Aim 1 on mice
using fecal microbiota transplants and evaluate effects on gut immune phenotype/function. We will utilize an α-
SYN gut injection model to explore how microbiota modulation affects PD progression. Successful completion
of the proposed studies will help understand critical pathophysiological pathways involved in early-stage
PD and inform novel strategies to prevent, risk stratify, and treat those at risk for LBD."

 Diseases of aging, like Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington disease, are expected to affect 153 million individuals
worldwide by 2050.1, 2 Treatments to prevent or slow these diseases will significantly decrease the projected impact,
and modeling how disease symptoms worsen over time—the symptom trajectory—before and after a diagnosis can help
evaluate if a treatment can prevent or slow a disease. Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy because these
diseases of aging progress slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before a diagnosis can be made.
This makes time to diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient will reach the criteria for a diagnosis sometime after the
last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom
trajectory without full information about when diagnosis occurs.
 This challenge creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-
censored covariate, time to diagnosis. Tackling this problem with “model-based methods,” which use models to estimate
the expected time to diagnosis and then predict the symptom trajectory, are convenient, but when the model for time
to diagnosis is wrong, so too is the estimated symptom trajectory. In contrast, a model-free strategy makes it easy to
estimate the symptom trajectory without bias, but no model-free strategy yet exists that is simultaneously robust and
predictive. This NIH supplement will provide technical training opportunities to Mr. Vazquez, a doctoral candidate of
biostatistics at UNC-Chapel Hill, so that he may develop a model-free strategy that is simultaneously robust and predictive
to improve both forecasting of expected symptom trajectories during clinical trials (Aim 1) and patient selection for those

 Preterm birth (PT, <37 weeks of gestation) is a significant public health concern due to the increased survival
rates combined with elevated risks of developing neurocognitive impairments among survivors. Extensive
research indicates that, relative to full-term infants (FTs), PT infants (PTs) exhibit deficits in basic visual attention
functions and motor skills emerging from the first year of life, accompanied by language delays in the first two
years. While attention and motor abilities serve a foundational role in language acquisition, there is limited
understanding of the mechanistic pathway from PT birth to language learning performance. Infant-parent
coordinated visual attention (CVA) that reflects infants’ ability to coordinate attention to an object with a caregiver
provides critical moments for language learning. Emerging research studying CVA in free-flowing FT-parent
interactions highlights that bouts of CVA arise from attention-motor coordination within individuals and between
infant-parent dyads. CVA bouts enhance FTs’ sustained attention to the toys and coincide with parents’ naming
of the toys. The multisensory experience facilitates real-time word learning and predicts better language
outcomes. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined how PT birth may impact the formation of
CVA and real-time word learning. There is also limited knowledge of the developmental cascading effects of
attention and motor deficits on CVA in PTs. To address these gaps, The present proposal aims to 1) examine
the impact of very PT birth (<32 weeks of gestation) on CVA and real-time word learning performance, and 2)
assess the longitudinal effects of infant and attention functions and motor abilities on CVA. In this longitudinal
study, comprehensive assessments of infant attention and motor abilities will be carried out at 12 months of age.
Attention subfunctions will be examined using three screen-based eye-tracking marker tasks. This age is marked
by the emergence of individual differences in endogenous attention control (i.e., executive attention). Gross
motor and fine motor skills will be assessed using a laboratory paradigm and a standardized assessment. At 18
months, we will incorporate mobile eye tracking in an infant-parent free-play paradigm to study the formation and
impacts of CVA from the first-person perspective. The infant-parent dyads will play with six novel toys with
pseudoword names. Real-time comprehension of the toy names will be examined immediately after the free play
using an eye tracking Looking-While-Listening task, a well-established paradigm that has been used to measure
word comprehension in 18-month-olds. Our innovation is marked by 1) uncovering mechanisms contributing to
PT-induced individual differences in language learning experiences, and 2) implementing a multi-timescale
investigation to study child-centered factors (i.e., attention and motor) that shape inputs for language learning in
real time (moment-by-moment) and across a 6-month span of development. In line with NICHD’s priority, the
findings will shed light on the developmental cascades from PT birth and enhance the ability to identify clinically
useful predictors of disrupted language acquisition following PT birth."

 Transplantation of solid organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, heart, lungs) can save the lives of
many patients with irreversible organ disease or injury. In the U.S., more than 40,000 transplants were performed
in 2021 alone. After a solid organ transplant, lifelong immunosuppressant therapy must be used to prevent and
treat organ rejection. The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus is a major therapeutic in such cases. Due to the risk of
organ rejection, infection, and drug toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring is advised to ensure pharmacokinetic
(PK) targets. Typically, the need for precise dosing has been linked to genetic differences, particularly those
affecting drug PK. Despite the important role of pharmacogenomics in precision dosing, large expression
variability occurs within each genotype, which can be captured by expression data. Moreover, no known genetic
signatures define the wide expression variations for certain key enzymes, such as CYP3A4. Hence, assessing
variability in expression of gut and hepatic CYP3A4 is a promising alternative to inform drug development and
precision medicine. This promising approach may capture transcriptional regulation effects, such as the
downregulation of CYP3A4 by proinflammatory cytokines.
 Recent exploratory studies showed the application of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) and omics
technologies deployed as a liquid biopsy to assess the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and
transporters. Hence, EV are gaining traction as new phenotyping biomarkers. Various EVs are shed into the
blood and contain cargo representing their tissue of origin. Building upon earlier findings, we will answer the
following research question: Can we use liver-derived EV as in vivo CYP3A4/5 expression biomarkers to inform
tacrolimus dosing in liver transplant patients? A prospective clinical study will be conducted in patients
undergoing liver transplants to explore whether liver and gut-derived EV expression data can be used to predict
the variability in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and ultimately to propose an optimal dosing regimen. In summary,
we will integrate PK, transcriptomic data, and modeling and simulation to establish an innovative strategy to
individualize tacrolimus dosing. The use of expression data to support precision dosing can potentially overcome
the exclusion of under-represented population subgroups (e.g. rare genetic variants of CYP3A4/5 and P-
glycoprotein (P-gp). Thus, this proposal will promote diversity in immunosuppression therapy by enhancing the
number of subjects responding to tacrolimus efficacy and reducing the risk of adverse reactions. Our research
will develop an integrated package of highly predictive mathematical models and dosing optimization strategies
for tacrolimus. By tracking different sources of variability in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, we will inform precision
public health interventions in solid organ transplant patients. Importantly, our liquid biopsy approach can be
further evaluated and applied in other solid organ transplant patients such as heart, lung, and kidneys."

The new OpenNotes rule in the United States enables all patients easy access to their medical
records. The policy affords many benefits to patients such as increased accessibility, improved
transparency, and better communication with medical providers. Additionally, OpenNotes may
improve health disparities by holding providers more accountable for their documentation
practices and medical decisions. However, concerns have emerged about the negative impacts
of this policy on the quality of clinical documentation. Notes may become less detailed and
patients may not understand the medical terminology, problems that may be more prevalent in
populations that experience health disparities. While the nationwide rollout of OpenNotes may
have enormous implications for the quality of documentation and patient perceptions of care,
little empirical evidence is available to guide policy decisions on how to adjust the policy or
mitigate harm. We will characterize the effects of OpenNotes on clinical documentation through
an empirical computational analysis comparing the change in the clinical language before and
after the policy implementation. In support of our analysis, we will develop clinical Natural
Language Processing (cNLP) based tools to analyze medical language focused on the most
likely types of documentation changes. We are especially focused on how these changes
manifest for populations that experience health disparities. Our focus will be on mental health
care due to the particularly sensitive nature of these notes. Furthermore, health disparities are
particularly pronounced in mental health care, and stigmatizing language in behavioral medicine
is of high concern. Our study will characterize changes in medical record language before and
after implementation of OpenNotes policies. We will utilize cNLP tools that can identify changes
and patterns in language use in EHR notes comparing language before and after OpenNotes
went into effect. We will also evaluate the effect of OpenNotes policies on language in patient
records for populations that experience health disparities. We will include an analysis of the
presence of stigmatizing language about the patient and examine how policy changes either
entrenched or improved existing healthcare disparities. Our analysis will draw on clinical notes
from patient care settings within the Johns Hopkins Medical System and two specialties: mental
health, selected because of the potential high impact of OpenNotes, and primary care, a control
setting for which we expect minimal impact."

Adoption of digital histopathology has increased demands for gigapixel image analysis tools and methods for
clinical applications. Integration of deep learning algorithms for automated tumor segmentation and cancer
diagnosis from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) dye or virtual (stainless) staining of tissue biopsy images have
been reported. There is a significant lack of explanation and performance evaluation (black box phenomenon)
of tumor segmentation and stainless staining deep learning models limiting clinician adoption in oncology
practice. Results from these deep learning systems are known after the biopsy is irreversibly processed by
H&E staining, and do not include confirmatory immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarker staining diagnosis
performed on adjacent tissue sections. We have previously described deep neural network systems to convert
native nonstained whole slide prostate tissue biopsy images (WSI) to virtual computationally H&E stained
versions validated for tumor segmentation with high precision. The goal of this proposal is developing novel
methods and algorithms for pixel-by-pixel explanations to clinicians and cancer researchers for explainability of
virtual H&E staining augmented with prostate tumor grade segmentation and IHC expression patterns by deep
learning models for digital biopsies. Our previously published and physician authenticated Generative
Adversarial Neural Network (GAN-CS) models trained with 93,199 image pairs of prostate biopsy images for
virtual H&E staining and prostate tumor segmentations, and a publicly available database of clinically validated
IHC analysis of prostate biopsy images will be used to generate the explainability software. A histological map
that visualizes and interprets correspondence between neural representations in GAN-CS model with virtually
stained prostate Gleason grade tumors in WSI at a pixel level will be generated. A separate explainable GAN-
CSS model for segmentation and Gleason grading of tumors using clinician annotations from H&E and
conjunctive IHC image biomarker labels will also be generated. Researchers can upload WSI into GAN-CS/S
software to perform computational H&E staining multiplexed with morphological tumor segmentations and IHC
expression with pixel-by-pixel visualization and explanation to characterize cellular phenotypes for cancer
research and accelerate histopathology diagnoses. The open source software toolkit developed from this
research can be generalized to majority of deep learning model architectures using disease labels from widely
available non-stained, chemical, or virtual H&E and IHC stained images from different cancer types."

Deficits in chemosensory processing are associated with healthy aging, as well as numerous neurodegenerative
disorders including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In many cases, chemosensory deficits are harbingers of
neurodegenerative disease, and understanding the mechanistic basis for these changes may provide insight into
fundamental dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegeneration. The genetic and physiological
accessibility of chemosensory neurons and their defined higher order processing centers provide a unique
opportunity to investigate the effects of aging-related processes on neural function, including sensory
responsiveness, plasticity, and synaptic connectivity. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a powerful model
for studying chemosensation, aging, and aging-related pathologies, yet the effects of aging on chemosensation
remain largely unexplored in this model, particularly with respect to taste. A large genetic toolkit combined with
functional imaging allow for cell-type specific manipulation of taste circuits. Numerous models of AD been
developed in Drosophila that largely phenocopy two hallmarks of AD: amyloid beta (Aβ)-mediated toxicity and
tauopathy caused by hyperphosphorylation of the Tau protein. My preliminary findings reveal that taste
perception and taste memory deteriorate with age, and this is exacerbated in a fly model of AD. Here, I will
examine the physiological and molecular basis for age-associated reduction in taste and taste memory in models
of natural and pathological aging. These experiments build on my expertise in chemosensory processing and
functional imaging, while providing training in aging and genomic approaches."

 Mechanical forces exerted by fetal movement during development influence skeletal morphogenesis. Thus,
fetal akinesia (insufficient movement), caused by low amniotic fluid volume, breech position or impaired muscle
development, can cause skeletal disorders such as hip dysplasia, arthrogryposis, and impaired bone
development. We found that maternal exercise (via wheel-running) rescued both bone and joint development
in “muscle-less limb” (Spd) mice and that bioreactor-based mechanical loading of explanted Spd limbs rescued
key aspects of limb development, directly implicating mechanical cues. To enable development of maternal
exercise-based interventions for fetal akinesia, we need to know how maternal exercise rescues akinesia-
impaired bone and joint development. Therefore, the goals of this application are to determine the cells that
respond to maternal exercise to rescue akinesia-impaired development and to define the underlying signaling
mechanisms. This will provide new insights into fetal akinesia and potentially identify maternal exercise as a
therapeutic intervention."

Adolescents in residential substance use (SU) treatment have the most serious SU disorders and the highest
rates of psychological, behavioral, legal, environmental, and vocational problems. Adolescents in residential
SU treatment are also at high risk of relapse, with follow-up studies demonstrating that 60% of discharged
adolescents relapse within 90 days. Parenting practices, including parental monitoring and parent-adolescent
communication, have been established as key predictors of adolescent SU outcomes and likelihood of relapse,
but parents are notoriously difficult to engage in adolescent SU treatment. Accordingly, there is a clear need for
effective, accessible, and scalable interventions for parents of adolescents receiving residential SU treatment.
Building upon our successful NIDA-funded R34, this study evaluates a technology-assisted parenting
intervention called Parent SMART (Substance Misuse among Adolescents in Residential Treatment), which
has evidence of high feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness, as an
adjunct to short-term residential treatment as usual (TAU). Parent SMART centers around an off-the-shelf
computerized intervention, Parenting Wisely (PW), which has demonstrated robust evidence of improving
parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems in multiple clinical trials. We conducted extensive
formative research with parents, adolescents, and residential staff to guide the development and delivery of
two highly scalable enhancements: 1) access to a state-of-the-art mobile networking app; and 2) up to four
telehealth coaching sessions to tailor PW content. Our networking app allows parents to submit questions to
an SU expert and connect with other parents of adolescents in residential SU treatment in real-time, while
reinforcing parenting skills via “Tip of the Day!” push notifications. In our pilot trial, Parent SMART was highly
feasible and acceptable, and demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in improving parental monitoring and
communication, reducing days of adolescent binge drinking and all other drug use, and reducing school-related
problems, among parents in short-term residential treatment. This R01 proposes a fully powered evaluation of
Parent SMART. Adolescent-parent dyads (n = 220 dyads; 440 in total) will be randomized to receive either
TAU only or Parent SMART + TAU. Multi-method follow-up assessments (i.e., self-report parent and
adolescent measures, parent-adolescent in vivo interaction task, 8-panel urine screens) will be conducted 6-,
12-, and 24-weeks post-discharge, to examine parenting skills, adolescent SU, and adolescent problem
behaviors. Exploratory analyses will test whether improvements in parenting skills partially mediate reductions
in adolescent SU. The proposed research has the potential to advance the field by: serving a high-need,
underserved population during a vital treatment juncture; targeting parenting practices (putative mediators) that
have been shown to predict adolescent SU outcomes; addressing barriers to accessing continuing care; and
testing a highly scalable intervention model informed by extensive formative research."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."

Host-microbe interaction plays a critical role in regulating the host’s nutrition, development,
immune system, and aging. Whether it is the microbe or its host, both have evolved to deal with
systemic or environmental stresses such as temperature, redox imbalance, xenobiotics, etc.
However, this ability of host organisms to respond to stress declines as they age, which
is associated with aging-related diseases. Considering microbes live in close proximity to the host
and experience the same stresses, the question arises as to whether microbial stress responses
may modify the host's stress response and longevity. Addressing this question could significantly
contribute to developing novel therapeutic paradigm targeting the microbial stress signaling for
regulating host stress responses and promoting healthy aging. Using laboratory adaptive
evolution, we evolved bacteria that resist oxidative stress and found that worms grown on these
genetically modified bacteria could live longer and resist oxidative stress. This preliminary data
provided the basis for our central hypothesis that alteration in the bacterial stress response can
change its metabolism, in turn regulating worms' metabolism, stress response and lifespan. The
specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) Characterize the role of stress evolved bacteria
on worm’s stress tolerance and lifespan; (2) Elucidate the role that bacterial iron-sulfur
homeostasis plays in regulating worm metabolism and longevity; and (3) Investigate bacterial-
host mitochondrial signaling in stress and lifespan regulation. Successful completion of this
project will highlight how microbial stress signaling is tied to host stress response and longevity,
paving the way for formulation of genetically modified probiotics for slowing aging and age-related
diseases.
Through this career development award, I will gain a deeper understanding of the stress response
and metabolism, as well as acquire new techniques to study the host-microbe interaction in order
to establish an independent career which will investigate how microbial genetic variation affects
host stress responses and longevity. In conjunction with my mentorship team, the University of
Michigan offers an excellent environment for my training for this proposal and my transition to an
independent career."
