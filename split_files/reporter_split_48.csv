A bidirectional relationship exists between Alzheimer’s disease and sleep, where disrupted sleep increases
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology and conversely, Aβ and tau aggregation disrupt sleep. The sleep/wake
cycle is a master regulator of metabolic and neuronal activity, where daily oscillations in activity are coupled to
the production and clearance of Aβ and tau. Although modulating neuronal activity alters both sleep/wake cycles
and Aβ/tau release, less is known about how fluctuations in glucose metabolism drive changes in sleep and
Alzheimer’s disease related pathology. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to determine whether changes in
metabolic activity lead to changes in neuronal activity to disrupt sleep in Alzheimer’s disease and whether
metabolic dysfunction can serve as a novel therapeutic target to rescue sleep and Alzheimer’s pathology. Using
hippocampal biosensors coupled with EEG/EMG recordings, this proposal will investigate how glycemic
variability and peripheral glucose intolerance affect sleep and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models of
Alzheimer’s related pathology. Moreover, we will establish whether normalizing peripheral glucose homeostasis
through treatment with the diabetic medication, metformin, is sufficient to preserve and restore sleep architecture
in the setting of Alzheimer’s disease."

Among the various areas in brain research, brain imaging is the most appreciated by a general audience. Due
to recent advances in imaging technologies, we can “see” brain in action. One of the most promising and
widely used noninvasive imaging technologies is functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based on the
Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. However, the physiological basis of this technique is
still poorly understood. Electrical recordings and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging have enabled us to
understand functions of identified neuronal populations. A major challenge of today is to connect these
microscopic neuroscience insights, which require invasive imaging and recording tools, with macroscopic
noninvasive fMRI signals.
To address this challenge, I propose to combine optical imaging of electrical neuronal activity
simultaneously with BOLD fMRI measurements in awake behaving mice. These experiments will leverage
an MRI-compatible optical imager that I have engineered and integrated into an animal holder since the first
submission (the old Aim 1). In the new Aim 1, I will explore the relationship of cell-type-specific neuronal
voltage and BOLD fMRI signals during spontaneous and task-induced neuronal activity. The BOLD signal can
be both positive and negative, and previous findings from my lab demonstrate the importance of a specific
population of cortical inhibitory neurons that release a signaling molecule Neuropeptide Y (NPY) causing
vasoconstriction via Y1 receptors. In the new Aim 2, I will address the role of NPY-positive neurons in
generation of BOLD signals. To this end, I will combine voltage imaging and BOLD fMRI with optogenetic
silencing of NPY-positive neurons and antagonizing the NPY-Y1 pathway.
From a technological perspective, my study will be the first to perform voltage imaging inside an MRI scanner.
On the biological side, my study will provide empirical data addressing the relationship between cell-type-
specific neuronal activity and the BOLD signal and evaluate the dependence of a specific macroscopic imaging
signal – negative BOLD – on a concrete cellular/molecular pathway. While working on my dissertation project, I
will expand my scientific knowledge base, produce high-profile publications, and build a foundation for my
future career as an independent investigator."
10830352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goals of this project are to 1) define the functions of Pax2 and Pax8 in recovery from kidney injury and 2)
provide the candidate with detailed training to facilitate an independent research career in renal regenerative
medicine. How the regeneration of renal epithelia is controlled remains poorly understood. Pax2 and Pax8 are
two homologous proteins that are re-expressed in regenerating renal epithelia after kidney injury, but their
function in these cells is unknown. Pax2 and Pax8 also are essential for normal kidney development and can
recruit histone methyltransferase complexes that can modify chromatin accessibility. Our preliminary data
show that selective deletion of Pax2 and Pax8 in the proximal tubule results in decreased renal epithelial
proliferation and impaired recovery after kidney injury. These observations suggest the hypothesis that Pax2
and/or Pax8 regulate regeneration by promoting de-differentiation, entry into mitosis, and the reestablishment
of epigenetic marks. Our first aim is to define the steps in renal epithelial regeneration that are dysregulated by
Pax2 and Pax8 deletion. Our second aim is to identify critical regeneration pathways regulated by Pax2- and/or
Pax8-mediated epigenetic modifications. These studies will form an experimental framework for training the
candidate in the epithelial biology of renal regeneration, epigenetics, transgenic animals, animal models of
kidney injury, and bioinformatics. Training at the bench will be supplemented with didactic courses, workshops,
and conferences. A mentorship team of established investigators in renal regeneration, renal physiology, and
bioinformatic analysis of kidney diseases has been assembled to guide the candidate through these
experiments and training activities to ensure a successful transition to independence. New expertise in the
biology of renal regeneration will augment the candidate’s prior experience in clinical nephrology and
biomaterials engineering to enable an independent and unique career studying renal regeneration."
10830432,"Project Summary: Integrins are transmembrane extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors composed of α and β
subunits that form heterodimers. Integrins regulate many functions including cell adhesion and migration as well
as signal and mechano-transduction. Integrins require both an ECM-binding ectodomain and a cytoplasmic tail
that binds a variety of intracellular proteins to promote signaling. Integrins are implicated in tumor initiation,
progression, and metastasis. However, integrin-targeted drugs, which focused on antagonizing the ectodomain,
have largely failed in oncology clinical trials. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail may drive
tumorigenesis independent of the ECM-binding ectodomain, though the mechanisms remain undefined.
 The principal integrins in the lung contain the b1 subunit. I have shown that integrin b1-knock out (KO) human
lung adenocarcinoma cells injected into the lungs of athymic mice fail to form tumors. These data suggest that
integrin b1 is required for lung adenocarcinoma development. Next, I developed integrin b1-KO cells that express
either wildtype (WT) integrin b1, integrin b1 with a non-functional/mutated tail (b1 mt-tail) or integrin b1 with a
non-functional ECM-binding ectodomain (Tac-b1). The WT and Tac-b1 cells formed soft agar colonies whereas
the b1 mt-tail cells formed none. These data suggest that the integrin b1 tail is sufficient to permit tumor growth.
 RNA-seq gene expression analysis identified decreased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
TGFb signaling signatures in integrin b1-KO cells. This correlation between integrin b1-KO and decreased
expression of EMT-related genes was corroborated in human tumors. When the integrin b1-KO cells were further
examined, I observed that while canonical TGFb signaling was unaffected, TGFb1-induced AKT phosphorylation
was decreased. This observation is consistent with my mentor’s previous data that integrin b1 regulates AKT
activation in a PI3K-independent manner that involves AKT lysine-63 polyubiquitination mediated by TRAF6. In
summary, integrin b1 tail is required for tumor growth, and loss of integrin b1 is associated with loss of EMT and
TGFb signal transduction. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that ECM-independent integrin b1 tail signaling
regulates EMT and permits lung cancer growth by regulating TGFb1-induced AKT activation.
I have developed two aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that integrin b1
promotes tumor growth by facilitating EMT. I will use lung cancer mouse models and evaluate EMT in tumors
with and without integrin b1 using histologic techniques and single cell RNA-seq. In Aim 2, I will test the
hypothesis that the integrin b1 tail is sufficient for tumor development, and tail interactions with TRAF6 are
required for TGFb-dependent AKT activation, EMT, and cell proliferation. I will use b1 mt-tail and Tac-b1 cells
to define the role of the integrin b1 tail and the mechanisms whereby it facilitates TGFb signaling to promote
lung cancer. Moving forward, I expect to leverage this training and data for R01-funding focused on integrin-
targeted cancer therapeutics."
10830433,"ABSTRACT
Normal aging is characterized by deficits in cognition particularly in the domains of memory (1-6) and executive
function.(1, 2, 7-11) Evidence suggests these changes are not a consequence of widespread cortical neuronal loss,
but rather are attributable to alteration and/or loss of white matter myelin, axons, synapses and dendrites, and
changes in oxidative metabolism and inflammation.(12-18) Further there is growing evidence that accumulation of
pathological Tau and A-Beta are related to age-related cognitive decline, even in the absence of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Thus, one potential therapy, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have
recently received attention as a possible intervention in aging,(19-22) as they are known to suppress inflammation
and facilitate tissue repair and remyelination. (19, 23, 24) Further, we have demonstrated that human umbilical-
derived cells, and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), the active product of MSCs, reduce inflammation
and enhance recovery of motor function in non-human primates (NHP) and rodents following cortical injury(25, 26)
and promote axonal growth and myelination in vitro.(27-37) Similarly, EVs have been shown to improve cognitive
deficits in diabetic rats and APP/PS1 mice (model of Alzheimer’s disease).(24, 38, 39) Whether these EV-mediated
beneficial effects can be applied to normal aging and age-related neuropathology in primates is largely unknown.
However, our pilot data show that administration of MSC-EVs in aged female rhesus monkeys decreases A-Beta
deposition. Based on this evidence and our data showing EV-mediated enhancement of recovery after cortical
injury in NHPs, we build upon on our experience over the past three decades (NIH-NIA Program Project
AG00001-34) characterizing cognitive function in the rhesus monkey across the life-span and age-related
changes in the brain (40, 41) to assess the impact of MSC-EVs in our rhesus monkey model of aging. Specifically,
we will investigate the efficacy of EVs to slow or reverse age-related cognitive decline and reduce markers of
inflammation, myelin atrophy, and tau and A-Beta deposition. We will then quantify the effects of EVs on reducing
age-related synaptic dysfunction and changes in electrophysiological properties of neurons. Finally, we will
conduct an in-depth proteomic analysis of treatment and endogenous EVs to establish the profile of the active
biological cargo load responsible for treatment efficacy. This longitudinal, multi-disciplinary study will shed light
on the relationships of neuroinflammatory pathways, myelin damage and ADRD like pathology and cognitive
decline associated with normal aging, and test the efficacy of EVs in ameliorating these age-related deficits in
neural structure and function."
10830993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapies, survival of metastatic epithelial ovarian
cancer remains dismal due in part to tumor heterogeneity and residual microscopic disease undetectable by
traditional imaging modalities. This malignancy involves peritoneal carcinomatosis at advanced stages; that is,
extensive tumor studding of the pelvic cavity and its resident organs. To address these “invisible” tumors, we
introduce a series of molecular-targeted and cell-activatable imaging and therapeutic agents integrated with a
newly developed miniaturized microscope for multiplexed molecular imaging in vivo—a cellular-resolution
hyperspectral fluorescence microendoscope—that uniquely enable visualization of microscopic deposits of
tumor cells deep inside the body. The multiplexed biomarker imaging feature is motivated by the critical need
to quantitatively monitor cancer cell phenotypes salient to treatment resistance and escape (e.g., cancer stem
cells are defined by multiple cell-surface biomarkers). In parallel, we have also developed near-infrared
photocytotoxic immunoconjugates (PICs) that target cell membrane molecules overexpressed by cancer cells,
including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), to create a combined photodynamic and receptor
antagonist therapeutic agent for tumor-targeted, activatable photoimmunotherapy (taPIT). The photodynamic
and fluorescence components become de-quenched (activated) upon cancer cell binding, cellular
internalization and lysosomal antibody proteolysis. This strategy overcomes off-target phototoxicity, including
bowel phototoxicity, the major clinical obstacle for photoactivated treatments in complex sites such as the
pelvic cavity. Here, we build on our prior work that shows the PIC is activated within ovarian micrometastases
with 93% sensitivity and 93% specificity in vivo, in a xenograft mouse model using EGFR overexpressing
human epithelial ovarian cancer cells, enabling accurate recognition of tumors as small as 30 μm and selective
destruction of disseminated peritoneal micrometastases. We propose to further develop this platform to
address tumor heterogeneity and chemoresistant phenotypes lurking within residual tumor deposits, which
represents a critical niche in cancer therapy. Current clinical imaging technologies cannot resolve microscopic
tumor deposits left behind by surgery and chemotherapy, and there are limited treatment options for patients
with recurrent, chemoresistant tumors. We anticipate that this new paradigm for microendoscopy-guided taPIT
will complement current treatment modalities for patients with advanced-stage disease and those receiving
salvage therapies, opening new avenues for personalized medicine. The new capabilities will be applied to
guide dynamically targeted taPIT adaptive to phenotype evolution in response to therapy and for monitoring
treatment response of microscopic residual disease."
10849301,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematological malignancies are the most common childhood tumors. Despite remarkable advances in survival
rates, they remain a leading cause of cancer death. Great progress has been made in understanding the genetic
basis of these tumors, which now requires systematic efforts to translate these discoveries into mechanistic
insight into the basis of tumorigenesis and advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Advancing
outcomes for children with hematologic malignancies requires training independent investigators with expertise
in genomic analysis, experimental modeling, translational science, and preclinical modeling of childhood
hematological malignancies (CHM). No other T32 training programs are solely devoted to training in CHM, nor
is there a training program that relies on the rich foundation of genomic discoveries from the Pediatric Cancer
Genome Project. This training program has been designed to equip the next generation of scientists with the
skills and knowledge needed from multifaceted disciplines to become leaders in childhood hematological
malignancy research. The T32 has funded eight postdoctoral trainees, and two additional trainees were
supported by institutional funds. In the current cycle, continued funding is requested for four postdoctoral trainee
T32 positions, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital will continue to support one slot to enhance recruitment
of an additional trainee from an underrepresented minority background. The program is designed to deliver an
individualized and enriched training experience for each trainee through the support of a team of multi-
disciplinary faculty with a wide range of expertise, cutting-edge core facilities, and robust training in genomic
approaches. Each trainee will have a mentorship team to include scientific and clinical investigators, with
oversight provided by an Internal Advisory Committee of dedicated faculty and an External Advisory Board
comprised of five national leaders in childhood cancer research and postdoctoral training. Trainees host
speakers for a lecture series on CHM topics related to genomics, biostatistics, experimental modeling, genome
editing, immunotherapy, and preclinical studies and present their research as part of an annual Training Day
attended by faculty and External Advisory Board members. A critical aspect of the program is participation in an
interactive grant writing workshop, with the expectation that trainees submit a fellowship application by their
second year. All trainees have completed or are enrolled in the workshop, and of the six initial trainees supported,
five successfully transitioned to independent funding. All trainees are closely integrated with the rich portfolio of
research activities of the St Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center Hematological Malignancies Program, which
coordinates the translation of basic science discoveries to clinical trials. This program provides an unrivaled
opportunity to train scientists to address critical unmet needs in childhood hematological malignancies."
10849303,"The goal of this proposal is to purchase a Bruker 15.2T magnet to replace the out-of-date 14T
Magnex magnet, which has been dedicated to supporting the high-resolution anatomical and
functional dynamic brain and whole-body mapping of animals and ex-vivo human brain tissue
imaging. The Martinos Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital has been at the forefront
of developing advanced functional mapping methods, e.g., functional MRI, and implementing
cutting-edge MRI methods to bridge the basic and translational studies. To pursue the next-
generation cutting-edge imaging methodology and prepare for the higher field MRI translational
studies, there is an urgent need to improve our ultra-high field preclinical MRI platform for high-
resolution animal and ex vivo imaging. In particular, the proposed Bruker Magnet upgrade will
boost the translational potentials of the novel methodology, e.g. the single-vessel fMRI, to bridge
cellular and microvascular anatomy and functional dynamics from animal to human brains. Also,
this proposal will support over 20 research projects funded by NIH, presenting critical translational
efforts on the mechanistic studies of brain disorders including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),
cerebrovascular dementia, and brainstem injury-induced coma. etc., as well as for the internal
organ imaging of animal models. The highly synergistic and collaborative research projects
outlined in our proposal can be summarized in three main themes: 1) Neurovascular dynamic
signaling, 2) Cutting-edge neuroimaging methodology, and 3) Multimodal mechanistic signatures
of animal disease models. We have established the multi-modal neuroimaging platform to
combine high-resolution anatomical and functional MRI imaging with the emerging neuro-
techniques, e.g. optogenetics, optical fiber-mediated biosensor recording of Calcium, Glutamate,
etc, promoting novel mechanistic understanding of the complexity of brain function. The proposed
ultra-high field magnet upgrade will provide key technological improvement to support the
performance of the novel brain mapping methods based on state-of-the-art electronics and
software design. Therefore, the proposed instrument upgrade would not only accelerate the
progress of the listed projects but also facilitate the translation of cutting-edge MR methodologies
as a truly multidisciplinary, regional resource for PHS-funded investigators."
10849312,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a complex disease with multiple risk factors/causes, and a broad spectrum of complications. The
rational development of novel clinical treatments for diabetes will require interdisciplinary approaches to integrate
multiple data sources, build predictive models, and develop new technologies that will together reveal the
multifactorial underpinnings of the disease. Such approaches are well-developed in engineering, but they have
not been widely applied to diabetes, in part because of a lack of people skilled in both engineering and biomedical
research. To develop such an interdisciplinary workforce, we propose to continue a novel Integrated Training in
Engineering and Diabetes (ITED) program to attract both predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows with
engineering and quantitative physical science backgrounds to work on research problems at the interface of
engineering and diabetes. Vanderbilt University is an ideal location for this program because of the close
integration and proximity of the Schools of Engineering and Medicine, the outstanding environment for diabetes
research, and the long-standing tradition of collegiality and collaboration across the Vanderbilt campus. The
overall goal of the program is to provide talented individuals from engineering backgrounds with state-of-the-art
training in diabetes research, which will give them a broad perspective of both basic biomedical research and
associated clinical challenges. Fourty-six faculty preceptors, evenly distributed between those with an
engineering background and a diabetes research focus, will work together to offer a wide variety of research
opportunities in engineering and diabetes research. Our program includes: a) a novel dual mentor plan where
each trainee performs interdisciplinary research in two labs, b) an efficient didactic program that provides
trainees with the necessary knowledge base in a compact time-frame that promotes timely completion of their
degrees, and c) interactions with other trainees, faculty, and visiting scientists. Two experienced mentors, one
from engineering and one from a diabetes research background, will supervise each trainee. This
interdisciplinary approach will require the trainees to spend significant time in each of the mentors’ labs. A broad
educational program for predoctoral trainees will leverage existing courses in the Schools of Engineering and
Medicine, supplemented by research seminars, a biweekly data clubs, and an annual ITED Retreat.
Postdoctoral trainees with engineering or physical science degrees will be specifically recruited to this program,
and will participate in all ITED activities. We do not expect all postdoctoral trainees to have a background in
diabetes research, so they will achieve competency through didactic instruction to fill existing knowledge gaps.
Support for 4 predoctoral trainees and 2 postdoctoral trainees is requested based on the research resources of
the faculty preceptors. A Steering Committee that represents the breadth of participating investigators will select
trainees based on their academic and research performance, and their promise as independent investigators.
The program will provide RCR training and actively seek to support individuals from underrepresented groups."
10849313,"Every living organism is made up of cells that are organized into tissues, whose micron-scale features define
normality and disease. These principles inspire the long-term goal of this project: to enable the quantitative
characterization of the Geometry of Life and Disease as a foundation for a comprehensive and integrative
understanding of how genes, environment and disease determine anatomical and microanatomical phenotypes.
Ideally, the effects of genes and environment on anatomical and microanatomical phenotypes can be assessed
across the whole organism. We understand the cellular basis of disease as a result of histology's representation
of all cell types and two centuries of application to clinical medicine. However, histology is 2-dimensional,
qualitative, subject to sectioning artifact, and samples only ~1-2% of specimens. To facilitate anatomically
comprehensive phenotyping across whole organisms, we have developed a unique, state-of-the-art 3D modality
(histotomography) based on the principles of X-ray tomography and the creation of large-field, high resolution
instrumentation for tomographic, synchrotron-based beamlines. The ability to conduct histological assessment
in a whole organism in 3 dimensions promises revolutionary advancements on numerous fronts. We propose to
establish the groundwork for large-scale access to synchrotron microCT for biology, including a pilot imaging
facility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and then at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for
histotomography, to initiate access to visualizations and histotomograms of whole, centimeter-scale model
organisms and tissues, and to establish a basic set of web-based visualization and cross-referencing tools for
the scientific community.
Cloud-based dissemination of raw and reconstructed image data will be piloted at the National Energy Research
Scientific Computing Center operated by LBNL or Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at ANL, to
enable users to advance their educational, functional, and scientific goals. Notably, the proposed groundwork
will comprise a foundation for computational phenotyping that is more comprehensive, objective, precise, and
statistically validated. Broad accessibility to microanatomical resources would enable valuable, new means of
model validation, reproducibility, and discovery, and provide a new foundation for a more comprehensive
understanding of genetic, molecular, and cellular function in the study of normal biology and disease. We expect
the proposed work to lead to unexpected research observations, improved clinical outcomes, enhanced
robustness and reproducibility of biomedical research, and enhanced sustainability and human health by
advancing the quality and comprehensiveness of global monitoring of environmental toxicity and climate change."
10848881,"The overarching objective of the proposed program is to provide an enriched and innovative predoctoral training
experience to foster the next generation of stellar neuroscientists. The Broad-based Research, Analytics, and
Innovation in Neuroscience (B2RAIN) Predoctoral Training Program takes advantage of the University of
Florida’s exceptional strength in neuroscience and its burgeoning Artificial Intelligence/data science
communities. Given these strengths, the University of Florida (UF) is uniquely suited to offer a training program
that strongly aligns with the stated goals of the Jointly Sponsored NIH Predoctoral Training Program in the
Neurosciences and to offer the first such program to predoctoral trainees in the State of Florida. Indeed, UF
offers an exceptional environment for the B2RAIN program that includes a strong cadre of dedicated and
productive mentors. The B2RAIN program is carefully designed to integrate a well-rounded core neuroscience
curriculum with coursework and practical experiences that will enable neuroscience predoctoral trainees to build
strong quantitative skills that emphasize AI principles, coding, experimental design, and statistical rigor.
Moreover, students will acquire a full complement of critical interdisciplinary skills around communication,
collaboration, rigor, and resilience that will bolster individual scientific and professional success. The requested
funds, together with a strong institutional commitment, will enable a minimum of eight neuroscience predoctoral
students to enter the program annually and for these students to be fully supported during their initial two years
of doctoral training while acquiring the essential foundational skills offered by the B2RAIN program. A minimum
of forty doctoral neuroscience students will benefit from this training over the course of 5 years. Following the
comprehensive training in fundamental neuroscience and rigorous quantitative approaches offered by the
B2RAIN program, the students will be well-prepared to complete doctoral research with one of over forty
outstanding preceptors. These mentors, who hail from across the UF campus, are dedicated to the training
mission and offer a wealth of expertise across a wide range of neuroscience subdisciplines including
systems/behavioral neuroscience, neurogenetics, cognitive neuroscience, and neurodegeneration. Trainees will
be recruited from a talented cohort of applicants to the UF neuroscience Ph.D. program and will demonstrate
the potential to become the next generation of innovators to drive progress in uncovering the complexities of the
nervous system in both health and disease. The emphasis on quantitative skills, scientific rigor, and on acquiring
essential professional skills important for long-term career success will add significant value to the participating
students’ doctoral training experience. Specifically, the B2RAIN Training Program will equip trainees with the
cross-disciplinary knowledge, skills, and perspectives to launch and maintain productive research careers at the
forefront of the rapidly-advancing neuroscience field."
10848883,"The purpose of this training program is to nurture the next generation of leaders in diabetes,
metabolism, and endocrinology research by providing post-doctoral candidates of exceptional
promise with the opportunity to train for successful careers in academic endocrinology. The
program is limited to post-doctoral applicants who hold MD and/or PhD degrees and have
demonstrated a strong interest in or prior exposure to biomedical research. Key program
features include intensive research in the laboratory and programs of participating faculty
members and broad didactic exposure to basic science, translational and clinical investigation.
Research areas span a wide range of endocrine disciplines, including diabetes, energy
homeostasis and weight control, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, neuroendocrinology,
metabolic bone diseases, genetic foundation of endocrine diseases, and enteroendocrine cell
pathophysiology. Scientific methods employed by the faculty span the gamut from early
discovery using model organisms, biochemical, biophysical, and systems biology approaches,
clinical hypothesis-testing, early validation of new treatment modalities, clinical trials, and public
health outcomes of commonly employed standards of care. By virtue of the breadth of expertise
of the participating faculty, trainees can select research questions that leverage their own
interest and enthusiasm to best suit their career goals. Training faculty and facilities are
predominantly in the Division of Endocrinology of the Department of Medicine at the Vagelos
College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University. However, the program is
distinguished by its broad reach into different areas of medical practice, as well as scientific
homes in Departments of Genetics, Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Pathology and Cell
Biology, and Pharmacology. Trainees are selected from a competitive applicant pool after
thorough vetting of their credentials by the Recruitment and Admissions Committee, with
significant involvement of the Diversity Enhancement Committee. Applicants admitted to the
program are carefully mentored by Research and Mentorship as well as Career Development
Committees, which form the basis of individual trainee committees. Post-training, the proposed
training program provides continued mentoring and advice on the transition to faculty positions

10849535,"Project Summary/Abstract:
This competing application seeks an additional five years (Years 11-15) of support for a postdoctoral research
training program in pain and substance use disorders (SUDs). The magnitude of these two problems in the
United States is astounding. Over 100 million Americans have pain that persists for weeks to years, and over
20 million meet the diagnostic criteria for a SUD, costing our country over $1 trillion annually. Contemporary
neurobiological, psychological, and epidemiologic research, as well as the tragic experience of the opioid
addiction epidemic show a clear intersection of pain and SUDs. Two of the National Academy of Medicine
Relieving Pain in America committee’s recommendations for improving research at a national level are to (1)
increase support for interdisciplinary research in pain and (2) increase the training of pain researchers.
Similarly, the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative has called for increased training of
multidisciplinary researchers in SUDs, pain, and their intersection.
Our proposal describes a collaborative, interdisciplinary postdoctoral (PhD, MD/PhD, and MD) training program
that will produce diverse scientists with a rigorous grounding in pain and SUD research. We request support for
10 postdoctoral fellows. The fellowship typically lasts 2 years for PhDs and 3 years for MDs seeking a robust
research foundation. The 23 accomplished faculty mentors are committed to interdisciplinary collaboration and
team-based mentorship across their substantive areas of expertise, which range from cells to society. Specific
faculty expertise and training opportunities include molecular and cellular biology, optogenetics,
electrophysiology, genetics, cognitive neurosciences, psychology, neuroimaging, data sciences, epidemiology,
health policy, and economics of pain and SUDs.
The training program, housed in the Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Stanford
University School of Medicine, develops postdoctoral trainees’ skills to prepare them to become independent
investigators in the fields of pain and SUDs. The training program includes required and elective coursework,
mentored research experiences, an individual integrated research project, seminars, and professional
development, including grant and manuscript writing. The training program will continue to be led by Sean
Mackey, MD, PhD, in collaboration with a steering committee comprising senior scientists/mentors and a
faculty leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion. This team will oversee the program's recruitment, training,
scientific, and administrative aspects, including a rigorous internal and external evaluation process. In
summary, this training program will bring together a diverse and talented group of postdoctoral trainees, an
accomplished team of interdisciplinary mentors, an effective administrative structure, and a world-class
research environment at Stanford University. The combination of talent and environment will launch the next
generation of independent investigators dedicated to pain and SUD discovery research and clinical translation."
10849879,"Two in five U.S. adults have obesity, and up to 30% of treatment-seeking adults with obesity engage in binge
eating, an eating disorder behavior characterized by eating a large amount of food and experiencing a loss of
control while eating. First-line interventions are face-to-face treatments, but current approaches commonly fail
to address both conditions and cannot reach all people in need. To fill this gap, we designed FoodSteps, the
first intervention for both obesity and binge eating, delivered by mobile device to increase scalability. We
integrated key mechanisms of behavioral and psychological treatments to provide a personalized medicine
approach that intervenes on five evidence-based treatment targets. Each week, users select a target and
create a plan for how they will practice that target to change their behavior. Our pilot data show FoodSteps is
engaging with high rates of completion and compliance, and intervening on the targets improves weekly binge
eating and weight on average, but rates are suboptimal. Our data indicate more precise intervention is needed,
but three challenges impede achieving this goal. It is unknown 1) which evidence-based targets are most
impactful for which people; and 2) in what sequence; as well as 3) how best to deliver targets to propel users to
change their behavior. We will resolve these challenges with a micro-randomized trial, the methodologically
ideal design because it uses repeated randomization to inform how to precisely intervene based on individual
needs. Adults with obesity and recurrent binge eating will receive FoodSteps for 16 weeks. Each week, 1 of the
5 targets will be randomly delivered to each user, to identify which targets work for whom (Aim 1) and in what
sequence (Aim 2). Weekly targets also will be randomly delivered either as a recommended target users can
select or as an assigned target, to identify how to deliver targets to propel behavior change (Aim 3). We will
assess time-varying user characteristics as moderators to inform the development of personalized algorithms
to tailor interventions to user needs over time. Our outcomes of interest are weekly changes in binge eating,
since it is a behavior that puts overall weight loss at risk, and change in weight long-term (Aim 4). Our data will
provide the infrastructure to build a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) capable of delivering highly
personalized intervention for binge eating and weight-related behaviors at a critical point in the behavior
change process; we will test the JITAI in a future trial. This trial furthers NIH and NIDDK’s mission to advance
treatment via more precise approaches by specifying which treatment targets drive behavior change, led by a
team expert in optimizing digital interventions, intervening on obesity and binge eating, and conducting micro-
randomized trials. Results have implications beyond FoodSteps given the role of these targets and processes
for behavior change broadly, and will propel personalized medicine by informing sophisticated models for
achieving the ultimate goal of personalizing the delivery of digital and non-digital interventions."
10849882,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia
(ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) often carry JAK2(V617F), MPL(W515L) and mutations in
calreticulin (CALRmut). These aberrations may be accompanied by mutations in TET2, ASXL1,
DNMT3A, EZH2, and other genes further complicating utilization of MPNs genetic/epigenetic
signatures as potential biomarkers for therapeutic decisions.
Current treatment options for MPNs include myelosuppressive therapy in the form of
hydroxyurea and JAK1/2 inhibitor QAK1/2i) ruxolitinib. MPNs can have prolonged chronic phases,
but may eventually accelerate and transform into a secondary acute myeloid leukemia that is
ultimately fatal. Therefore, it is imperative to generate new therapies that alone or in combination
with already approved drugs could potentially extend the complete remission time and/or be used
in patients which progressed to the malignant stage. Since all 3 ""main"" mutations [JAK2 (V617F),
CALR(del52), and MPL(W515L)] were found in MPN stem cells (MPNSCs) these cells must be
eliminated in order to improve therapeutic outcome. Unfortunately, the potential therapeutic
approaches against MPNSCs are limited.
MPN cells, including MPNSCs accumulate potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
which are repaired by two major mechanisms, BRCA-mediated homologous recombination (HR) and
DNA-PK -mediated non-homologous end-joining (D-NHEJ). HR and D-NHEJ repair DSBs in
proliferating cells and D-NHEJ plays a major role in quiescent cells. PARP1 -dependent back-up NHEJ
(B-NHEJ) serves as back-up in both proliferating and quiescent cells.
Cancer-specific defects in DSB repair create the opportunity to employ synthetic lethality, e.g.
elimination of BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells by PARP1 inhibitor (PARP1i). However, BRCA1/2
mutations are rare in MPNs. We hypothesize that MPN-inducing mutations are prognostic
biomarkers of therapeutic synthetic lethality triggered by DNA repair inhibitors.
We will determine if specific MPN-inducing mutation(s) (biomarkers) predispose quiescent
and/or proliferating MPN stem and progenitor cells from individual patients to PARP1i-induced
synthetic lethality combined with the inhibitors of HR and D-NHEJ (Aim #1) or with JAK2i (Aim #2).
We will also employ murine knockin/knockout models of MPNs and primary MPN xenografts in
humanized immunodeficient mice to determine if DNA repair inhibitors and/or JAK2i exert anti-MPN
synthetic lethal effect in pre-clinical settings (Aim #3)."
10849772,"Project Summary/Abstract
In most countries approaching elimination, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) represents an increasing proportion relative
to P. falciparum (Pf). Mass drug administration (MDA), as a way target subpatent, asymptomatic infections, is
recommended for P. falciparum elimination, but the recommendation does not extend to P. vivax given limited
evidence, tools, and safety concerns. The objective of our study is to evaluate the long-term impact, safety,
and cost-effectiveness of focal MDA (fMDA) for Pv transmission reduction. To test our hypothesis that fMDA, in
addition to standard aggressive interventions, will safely reduce transmission, we propose a 3-year open-label
CRCT in the low endemic setting of Loreto Region, Peru. Villages or clusters will be randomized to control or
fMDA. The control arm will receive standard interventions (vector control, symptomatic case management, and
active case detection of asymptomatic cases). The treatment arm will receive standard interventions plus fMDA,
which will utilize a new drug for radical cure of P. vivax, tafenoquine, and a new quantitative glucose 6
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency rapid test to support safe administration of tafenoquine. fMDA
will be targeted to consenting and eligible high-risk villagers, defined as household members and neighbors of
recent Pv index cases. fMDA will be conducted in 2 rounds per year, two months apart during the low malaria
season, and over 3 years. Eligibility will be re-assessed each year, and prior to each fMDA round. Specific
aims are to: 1) Determine the effectiveness of fMDA to reduce Pv transmission as measured in a primary
outcome of incidence and secondary outcomes of infection prevalence, seroprevalence, and genetic diversity,
2) Evaluate the safety and tolerability of fMDA, and 3) Measure the cost-effectiveness of fMDA. To maximize"
10853442,"SUMMARY: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cardiac condition that is frequently associated with trace
to mild mitral regurgitation, is usually asymptomatic, and most often ignored. When MVP progresses to significant
regurgitation, patients may develop heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension and is a frequent
indication for intervention. However, MVP is a phenotypical presentation of numerous underlying diseases and
is commonly encountered in collagen vascular disorders and a large variety of congenital disorders. Underlying
tissue characteristics including fibrosis of the left ventricle and papillary muscles, and mitral annulus disjunction
are associated with MVP, predispose to ventricular arrhythmias which may be fatal, and do not necessarily
correlate with severity of MVP and regurgitation. The purpose of this project is to enhance the clinical
identification of people who are at risk of moderate to severe MVP or have associated factors that indicate risk
of unexpected health events or complicate the treatment. In Aim 1, this project will describe the history of MVP,
related cardiac morbidities, and other conditions that may contribute to or identify the risk of poor health
outcomes. This will involve evaluation of a large population in Intermountain Health, a health system with more
than 30 years of data warehousing of electronic health record (EHR) data. Intermountain’s 33 hospitals, 385
medical clinics, and integrated services provide health and healthcare services to people across 7 mountain
states and includes a broad rural health component. Outcomes will include MVP diagnosis and post-diagnosis
health events. For Aim 2, the project will evaluate heritable risk factors for MVP endpoints. This will first leverage
a unique population genealogy of tens of millions of people in family pedigrees and linked EHR data to examine
familial risks. It will also employ a large-scale genetic testing project with hundreds of thousands of participants
to evaluate polygenic risk scores. Unfortunately, no risk stratification nomogram exists for assessing MVP risks
and predictors of MVP onset and progression are reported in piecemeal form, thus in Aim 3, drawing together
clinical and genetic risk prediction approaches, a novel set of clinical decision tools will be created using EHR
data to empower the identification of people who are at risk of MVP-associated outcomes. Most importantly, this
will include multivariable risk equations for stratifying risk of severe health endpoints for people with MVP that
can be used to inform risk assessment and clinical care plans in guiding management and treatment of people
with elevated risk of death or major health events. One set of risk models will be developed with the aim of
creating a clinical decision tool that predicts a near-maximum amount of variance in risk using a parsimonious
set of clinically-available factors that can be used in the EHR background to calculate a risk score that the EHR
delivers to the point of care without needing modified data collection or clinician input in the EHR process. This
project will resolve disconnects in MVP risk assessment and treatment, providing decision tools that can be
clinically implemented for standardized MVP risk assessment to achieve the healthiest MVP outcomes possible."
10853674,"Abstract
A hallmark of aging is an impaired ability to adequately recover following a stressor, such as muscle disuse,
resulting in muscle fibrosis and weakness thereby increasing the risk for falls and loss of independence.
Mechanistic-based therapeutic strategies to enhance muscle recovery in older adults do not exist. Synchronized
muscle interstitial cellular events involving immune cells (e.g., macrophages), fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP)
cells and satellite cells are critical to promote myogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and ultimately,
restore muscle size and function. However, in aging, senescence cells exceed the rate of removal during
recovery from injury resulting in excessive senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP; secretion of
factors such as pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators) thereby amplifying dysfunction in macrophages,
FAPs and satellite cells and resulting in poor ECM remodeling. Metformin has been implicated to have positive
effects on muscle size and function through non-glycemic mechanisms. Of interest to the current proposal,
metformin has been shown to enhance macrophage function and lessen cellular senescence burden by targeting
SASP in a variety of muscle interstitial cell. However, the role of metformin to improve ECM remodeling and
muscle recovery in older adults following disuse atrophy through immunomodulating and senomorphic
mechanisms have not been examined. We provide compelling data in older adult skeletal muscle that a clinical
dose of metformin can potentially improve muscle macrophage, FAP and satellite cell function while also
decrease muscle fibrosis and cellular senescence and SASP. Therefore, the purpose of this application is to
conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in older adults to determine if short-term
metformin delivery (vs placebo) during the recovery phase following disuse atrophy can improve macrophage
function, reduce cellular senescence and SASP, and enhance ECM remodeling thereby facilitating muscle
regrowth. We will use state-of-the-art methodologies and elegant in vivo and vitro approaches to identify the
impact metformin treatment on macrophage, FAP and satellite cell senescence and SASP, collagen
organization, and muscle regrowth in aging. We anticipate that the findings will aid in the repurposing of
metformin to be timely delivered to accelerate the recovery of aged muscle following disuse related events (e.g.,
surgery, illness)."
10854617,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Developing a preventative HIV vaccine remains a global health priority and to be effective will most likely
need to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). HIV bnAbs are derived from rare, unmutated common
ancestor (UCA) B-cell precursors in elite HIV+ human repertoires. To reproducibly activate such UCA+ B-cells
to affinity mature and acquire bnAb function, `Germline Targeting' (GT) vaccine protocols are being developed
typically for a single bnAb lineage, and only induce sporadic and/or weak serum bnAb responses using
protracted boosting schemes that are clinically impractical. Clearly, more efficient GT regimens are needed
that can elicit multiple bnAb specificities, and appropriate animal models to track and follow up on promising
lead neutralization signals in the serum. We recently equipped a new membrane (m)Env liposome (MEL)
platform with a GT mutation in mEnv that reproducibly induces tier 2 serum neutralization using semi-
polyclonal CH103 UCA knockin (KI) mice after only two boosts. This represents the first GT regimen to elicit a
`CDRH3 dominated' nAb response to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) in which UCA B-cells are also under
anergy control. The overall objective of this proposal is to build on this novel GT platform, to both improve
HCDR3-dominated specific responses, and to adapt it to target the relatively better-studied VH restricted-
targeted CD4BS cluster and HIV's Fusion Peptide (FP) domain. We hypothesize that GT MEL sequential
priming modalities (and mRNA-LNPs) tested in strategically selected CD4BS bnAb UCA knock in models
(while manipulating frequencies and tracking development of multiple UCA lineages), will help us identify a
vaccine regimen that will elicit HIV serum neutralization in “higher bar”, fully polyclonal human Ig pre-clinical
animal models. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will optimize the existing MEL-based GT regimen, as above, in the
lead CH103 UCA KI model. Then, in Aim 2, we will test the ability of mEnv modalities first to drive physiological
numbers of `VRC01-class' CH31 UCA precursors towards breadth in WTàCH31 KI chimeric mice, and then
evaluate CH31/CH103 UCA multi-GT mEnv regimens promoting elicitation of both CD4BS bnAb lineages (in
CH31àCH103 chimeras). Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the ability of FP nanoparticle (FP-NP) prime-mEnv
boosting regimens to elicit serum nAb responses in WT and UCAàWT chimeric mice, and ultimately test the
best FP and CD4BS regimens combined in Omni Mice and Omni Rats, which express fully polyclonal,
unrearranged human V (D)J repertoires. These studies, even if partially successful, will reveal the serum HIV
nAb breadth that can be elicited by next-generation mEnv vaccine platforms against multiple overlapping
targets on the CD4BS and FP, and may be advantageous in overcoming Ig repertoire holes across individuals,
preventing viral escape, and requiring less overall boosting.

Bipolar disorder I (BD1) is characterized by pathological mood swings ranging from mania (e.g., high energy,
minimal sleep) to depression (e.g., low energy, increased/decreased sleep). BD affects ~2% of adults, and is
associated with increased disability and mortality. Disrupted sleep and circadian patterns are a primary feature
of BD. Relative to healthy controls and unipolar depression, BD adults are more likely to have a late
chronotype (reflecting later circadian timing) and have more variability in sleep. We have reported that a late
chronotype and increased variability in sleep are predictive of mood and energy in BD. BD1 may be associated
with increased sensitivity to light. Most studies that examined the suppression of nocturnal melatonin secretion
to light have reported increased sensitivity to light in BD1 versus controls, regardless of mood and medications.
However, melatonin suppression is an indirect measure of light sensitivity, is highly variable, and assessment
is limited to night-time. The post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) is a more direct measure of the sensitivity
of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) which signal light levels to brain centers that
modulate mood, sleep and circadian rhythms. Only one study has assessed PIPR in BD and found no
difference from controls, but participants’ eyes were dilated which may have maximized light sensitivity (ceiling
effect), and most assessments were at midday when light may have reduced impact. Given the known impact
of light on sleep, mood and energy, there is an important need to assess PIPR in BD. The objective of this
study is to assess light sensitivity with PIPR in BD (euthymic or depressed) and age and sex-matched healthy
controls and to do so at times when light exposure during the waking period has the greatest impact on the
circadian system: right before and right after the nocturnal sleep episode. We will also examine light sensitivity
(PIPR) as a potential driver of variability in sleep, mood and energy. We will leverage our highly engaged and
well-characterized cohort of BD adults who regularly participate in research (Prechter Study). We will enroll 80
participants for a sample of n=60 after attrition (30 BD1, 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls). We
propose a 3-week protocol with 1 week of sleep monitoring using wrist actigraphy (to determine habitual sleep
timing), one night in the sleep laboratory with PIPR assessed 30 minutes before habitual bedtime and 30
minutes after habitual wake time, followed by 2 weeks of wrist actigraphy and ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to assess variability in sleep, mood and energy. Aim 1: compare light sensitivity between
BD1 and controls. Aim 2: determine if light sensitivity drives variability in sleep, mood and energy in BD1 and
controls. Exploratory Aim: determine if light sensitivity is associated with seasonality and mood course in the
previous year in BD1 and controls. Results will reveal the mechanistic links between light sensitivity (PIPR) and
variability in sleep, mood and energy – key clinical targets in the treatment of BD. Findings will also inform trials
aimed at shaping light exposure to shift circadian timing earlier and reduce sleep and mood variability in BD."

bladder and erectile dysfunction following pelvic surgery.
Abstract:
Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy are at high risk of developing both bladder and erectile dysfunction,
even when minimally nerve-sparing approaches are used to avoid direct damage to the urogenital organs and
their neurovasculature. The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that result in this coordinated
development of bladder and erectile dysfunction (ED) following pelvic surgery.
We recently reported that in rats, simple laparotomy results in ED 3 days after surgery, and is accompanied by
systemic and also local inflammatory responses in penile cavernosal tissue, cavernous nerve (CN) and major
pelvic ganglia (MPG). Interestingly, even though this surgical procedure avoids direct nerve injury, the profile of
molecular changes in cavernosal tissue was strongly indicative of CN injury, suggesting that development of ED
following nerve-sparing pelvic surgery may involve a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in indirect nerve
injury. In preliminary data presented here, we demonstrate that in both rat models of minimally invasive pelvic
surgery and direct CN injury, the development of ED is accompanied by significant changes in bladder function.
Moreover, we also observed an inflammatory response at the level of the MPG, which innervates both cavernosal
and bladder tissues. A pathological inflammatory response in the MPG may therefore mediate pelvic organ
crosstalk leading to the coordinated development of bladder and erectile dysfunction.
These observations have led us to the hypothesis that even following minimally invasive, nerve-sparing
pelvic surgery that avoids direct damage to the urogenital organs, there is a pathological inflammatory
response in the MPG that mediates pelvic organ crosstalk and coordinated development of bladder and
erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that modulating the inflammatory response will improve
post-operative urogenital function outcomes.
We will test these hypotheses with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will utilize animal models to compare the
impact of different levels of pelvic surgical trauma (naïve rats compared with those undergoing laparotomy,
sham-CN injury, CN crush or CN transection) to correlate the time-course and severity of post-operative bladder
and erectile dysfunction with the levels of the inflammatory response (systemically, in urogenital tissue, and in
the CN and MPG). In Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of post-surgical inflammation on the MPG and
determine the extent to which MPG molecular and structural remodeling provide a substrate for pelvic organ
crosstalk leading to coordinated post-surgical development of bladder and erectile dysfunction. In Aim 3 we will
use anti-inflammatory drugs to determine the role of the inflammatory response on the coordinated development
of urogenital pathology and obtain pre-clinical rationale for the potential use of anti-inflammatories to improve
post-operative urogenital function."

 2 Obesity and related chronic diseases that result from years of poor diet and physical activity (PA) may be
 3 prevented by wellness programs for toddlers (18–36 months) and their parents. It is difficult to engage families
 4 in such programs, but we successfully engaged a diverse (>70% African American or Hispanic) sample of parent-
 5 toddler dyads in our FUNPALs Playgroup pilot study. Typical toddler obesity prevention programs instruct
 6 parents to improve the nutritional quality of meals and snacks and to find ways to increase toddler physical
 7 activity (e.g., WIC, SNAP Ed). However, attempts to improve toddler health behaviors are less effective if not
 8 delivered within a warm and nurturing parent-child relationship, and parents are often uncertain how to feed their
 9 children a healthy diet and encourage physical activity when toddlers resist (e.g., food refusal, tantrums, whining,
10 etc.). To address this need, our team, using the Intervention Mapping Framework, created the FUNPALs
11 Playgroup, which includes educational, but fun interactive programming to help parents from mostly African
12 American and Hispanic backgrounds reduce obesity risk among toddlers by addressing general parenting skills
13 in conjunction with traditional nutrition and physical activity content. Playgroups—parent-child groups that meet
14 regularly for social, physical, and educational play—present an opportunity to engage families in obesity
15 prevention efforts while offering positive parenting instruction. Our pilot study (n=50) showed toddlers in the
16 FUNPALs Playgroup, particularly those with overweight/obesity (OW/Ob; 52%), experienced desirable changes
17 in weight, diet, sleep, and parenting. The FUNPALs Playgroup was feasible and as effective or more effective
18 (e.g., reducing sugar sweetened beverages) than the standard health education control group on most
19 outcomes. Further, the FUNPALs Playgroup was superior in terms of acceptability and engagement. This study
20 will test the efficacy of the FUNPALs Playgroup to reduce obesity risk among toddlers from ethnically diverse
21 backgrounds. The central hypothesis is that the FUNPALs Playgroup will reduce obesity risk among a diverse
22 sample of toddlers more than no treatment or standard parent health education. In this multi-methods 3-arm,
23 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 340 toddlers (18-36 months) and parents from an underserved community
24 will be randomly assigned to receive: 1) 10-weekly sessions of the FUNPALs Playgroup, 2) 10-weekly sessions
25 of a standard parent health education class, or 3) no treatment. Weight status, diet, and activity will be assessed
26 at baseline (T1), 12-14 weeks after baseline (immediate post, T2), and 24-weeks after baseline (follow up, T3).
27 The RE-AIM framework will be used to determine key elements for maximizing external validity and
28 implementation.

10857766,"Platelets are critical in maintaining hemostasis and platelet counts are tightly regulated in healthy individuals. In
several pathologies, the disruption of thrombopoiesis leads to abnormal platelet counts which significantly
impact clotting and/or bleeding risks. Thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling through the myeloproliferative leukemia
virus (MPL) receptor is the only known driver of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and maturation from
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, therapies targeting the TPO/MPL axis do not work for all patients,
leading to an unmet need for identifying new targets to modulate platelet counts. We have found that
membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in MK progenitors regulate MK development and platelet
production, representing a novel target for modulating megakaryopoiesis and platelet count. Our main
hypothesis is that MKs and their progenitor cells utilize the CD36 receptor to take up PUFAs from exogenous
sources, and accumulation of membrane PUFAs is essential for maintaining normal MK development and
platelet count. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims using novel techniques such as click
chemistry, cellular barcoding and phospho-flow cytometry, and the newly published Fatty Acid Library for
Comprehensive ONtologies (FALCON) platform paired with human and murine in vitro models, in vivo murine
models, and human iPSC-derived organoids. Aim 1 will determine the cell-type-specific enzyme requirement
for PUFA accumulation during megakaryopoiesis. We will use in vivo and in vitro models to determine which
enzymes play a role in PUFA accumulation in MKs and whether they are viable targets to manipulate MK
development. Aim 2 will reveal if the CD36 receptor preferentially takes up PUFAs at the expense of saturated
fatty acids. We will use CD36-/- mice and a novel in vivo click-chemistry technique to provide the first in vivo
evidence of selective PUFA uptake. We will determine if CD36 within MKs and MK progenitors preferentially
promotes the internalization of fatty acids with a specific saturation status and whether this process is impacted
by dietary fatty acid composition. Aim 3 will examine the mechanisms by which PUFA uptake influences
megakaryopoiesis. This inquiry will be addressed using 1) a targeted approach focusing on MPL signaling via
interaction with membrane lipids and 2) a hypothesis-generating approach using the FALCON platform to
generate new leads into potential TPO-independent MK differentiation pathways impacted by fatty acids.
Successful completion of the proposed experiments will extend the discovery of the role of membrane PUFAs
in MK development and platelet production to reveal a detailed and actionable roadmap of the mechanisms by
which both human and murine MKs and progenitors accumulate and utilize PUFAs to drive platelet production,
potentially leading to therapeutic and dietary interventions to modulate platelet production for patients with
diverse thrombotic and platelet disorders."
10857612,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anhedonia (ANH), the reduced ability to anticipate or experience pleasure, is a major transdiagnostic contributor to
disability, inferior quality of life, and a core characteristic of multiple severe psychopathologies. ANH emerges in
adolescence prior to the onset of these disorders and is highly prevalent (up to 20%) in youth 13-15 years. However, ANH
in adolescence is poorly understood and interventions remain few. A growing body of evidence suggests that stress
exacerbates ANH and dysregulated acute stress response mechanisms may critically contribute to ANH. Yet, little is
known about the role of stress neurobiology in the emergence, course, and severity of ANH in adolescence, a critical
developmental period marked by significant pubertal changes and steep maturation of neural circuits implicated in the
recalibration of the stress-response systems and mood regulation.
The objective of the current proposal is to characterize how biological acute stress response mechanisms influence the
severity and trajectory of ANH. ANH research to date has almost exclusively focused on single-system physiological
responses to acute stress, such as autonomic nervous system (ANS - parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system
branches - PNS-SNS) or endocrine (HPA - Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal) system responses. New evidence supports the
need for multi-system approaches to detect clinically meaningful patterns of stress responses associated with ANH.
Recent research from our labs (PI Belger and Co-PI Roubinov) has shown that (1) discrete physiological latent stress-
response profiles (Buffered, Vigilant, Sensitive) that integrate unique patterns of responses across HPA and ANS systems
have additional utility in predicting both clinical and functional development outcomes beyond single-system biomarkers.
In this proposal, we will examine how a novel constellation of complex neurobiological stress response mechanisms
interactively contributes to ANH in adolescence. Using a multimodal approach including functional MRI (Magnetic
Resonance Imaging), physiological HPA and ANS stress reactivity, and clinical and cognitive assessments, the proposed
study will be the first to integrate physiological and neural acute stress response mechanisms to derive multisystem stress
response biotypes (MSRB) and explore their contributions to ANH severity and trajectory in adolescence. We will study
192 adolescents ages 13-15 years experiencing a range of ANH at baseline, 10 months, and 20 months across 2 aims. In
Aim 1 we will identify multisystem stress response biotypes (MSRBs) integrating physiological and neural responses to
acute stress in adolescents and examine their longitudinal stability. In Aim 2, we will determine the characteristics of
multisystem latent stress profiles that predict the severity and trajectory of ANH in adolescence. Across both aims, we
will examine age, sex, and pubertal stage as covariates.
IMPACT: This project will contribute a novel framework for understanding and modeling the complex multisystemic
biological mechanisms governing stress responsivity during adolescence. Understanding the individual and interactive
contributions of physiological and neural systems to ANH presents a unique opportunity to develop specific interventions
that target malleable stress systems in adolescents with ANH."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH is a rare, progressive, incurable, and fatal cardiopulmonary vascular
disease leading to right ventricle failure and ultimately to death. Despite the available treatments and ongoing
research efforts, there is currently no curative treatment against PAH or pathological vascular remodeling.
Changes in chromatin that can influence the epigenetic regulation of many genes and their functional
consequences on vascular remodeling in PAH are poorly understood. The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable
(SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes control the accessibility of chromatin to transcriptional and
coregulatory machinery. The AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1a (ARID1a), a subunit of the
SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, plays key roles in normal physiology and diseases. The functional
implications of ARID1a deficiency are dependent on its downstream transcriptional consequences, which can
be altered by other epigenetic transcriptional regulators in the specific cellular context. Homeostasis requires
balanced action of ARID1a and the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, through
chromatin-mediated gene expression. Yet, the role of ARID1a in PAH remains understudied. Given the various
studies implicating ARID1a as a critical tumor suppressor, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the
expression level of ARID1a and the link between ARID1A and EZH2 in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells
(PASMCs) growth and dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that ARID1a loss impairs enhancer-mediated
gene regulation and drives aberrant growth of PASMCs in PAH through altered chromatin accessibility and/or
DNA methylation via EZH2. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data of a significant reduction of ARID1a
expression level in PAH human and animal models of PAH. Importantly, ARID1a depletion increases PASMC
proliferation and increases EZH2 expression. Hence, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following
three specific aims: 1) Investigate the function of ARID1A in PASMC phenotype, and the central role of ARID1a
in the chromatin dynamics and the regulation of gene expression in PASMCs; 2) Evaluate the impact of SMC
conditional ARID1a ablation in the pathogenesis of PAH; and 3) Assess the effectiveness of the combination
therapy of AAV2.5/ARID1a with EZH2 inhibitors in the context of severe rat models of PAH. The data generated
from this proposal will advance our knowledge about the role of ARID1a in the phenotype of PASMC-driven
pulmonary vascular disease with implications for potential therapeutic interventions in PAH."

Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSBs) can help prevent obesity and dental caries, two of
the most prevalent pediatric diseases, disproportionately impacting marginalized youth. Adequate hydration
also impacts cognitive function, essential for academic success. Federal policies require public schools to
provide free drinking water and place restrictions on SSB availability. Yet, these policies alone have not
optimized student hydration practices and numerous barriers to healthy hydration remain. An urban Virginia
school district has partnered with our team to optimize hydration. This district has newly installed water bottle
refill stations (“hydration stations”) and a model hydration policy. Yet challenges with policy implementation and
inadequate drinking vessel access presented major barriers to hydration. To address this concern, we used a
participatory approach to build capacity and gather in-depth information on community strengths and needs
related to hydration. Grounded in participatory research methods and informed by extensive formative work,
we developed a multi-faceted program that aligns with the social-ecological framework to optimize hydration
and advance drinking water equity, builds on district strengths, and addresses gaps. We propose to conduct a
stepped wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention within 12
randomly selected, matched Title I elementary schools serving predominately Black and Latinx students from
lower income backgrounds who all receive free meals (N=~6400 students). This intervention was designed
collaboratively with key stakeholders, partners with teacher and student ambassadors, and includes social
marketing, behavioral reinforcement, and education and outreach. Students and staff receive refillable water
bottles and promotional materials encouraging water consumption over SSBs. Teachers receive training on the
hydration policy and hydration lessons to integrate into their curriculum. School-wide assessments of: 1)
hydration station usage (primary outcome), 2) water bottle usage and beverage selection at lunch, and 3)
beverage intake will be conducted. Longitudinal assessments of anthropometrics and dental caries will be
conducted with a randomly selected subset of 3rd grade students (N=406). We will also obtain data on
beverage sales, NSLP participation, and academic outcomes, and conduct a systematic evaluation of
sustainability. Consistent with the stepped wedge design, concurrent assessments will be conducted at 6
timepoints in all 12 schools over 3 years, with all baseline (T0 [timepoints prior to the intervention]) and post
(T1-T6 [timepoints after receiving the intervention]) data used in primary effectiveness analyses. Results will
directly inform school-based interventions addressing these urgent public health needs and guide policy
mandates regarding access to and promotion of water within the school setting."
10834124,"Synapses throughout the central nervous system are sculpted by neural activity through
changes in their size, shape and molecular composition, which either strengthen or weaken
communication between neurons. This “plasticity” in synapse function is widely viewed as the
central mechanism for information storage in the brain. While many forms of synaptic plasticity
have been discovered and their molecular mechanisms intensely investigated, in many cases
there is surprisingly little direct evidence linking them to the cognitive functions they are
proposed to control. This has remained a challenge due to a lack of tools for rapidly and locally
switching on or off the requisite biochemistry and cell biology underlying different plasticity
mechanisms in real time, in vivo. We are developing new tools that fill this void with the long-
term goal of addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge concerning how synapses are
modified at the molecular level through development and plasticity, how these modifications
influence synapse/circuit function and ultimately the relevance of these mechanisms for
important cognitive functions like learning and memory."
11116831,"In recent years, excessive impulsivity and impulse control disorders (ICDs), which commonly include
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping, binge-eating, and hypersexuality, have been recognized as an
important complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). Both impulsivity and ICDs negatively affect patients and
their family quality of life and emotional well-being. In addition, ICDs are a cause of considerable increase in
care burden. For these reasons, the problem of excessive impulsivity has become a crucial issue in regards to
the care of PD patients. Dopamine-replacement therapy (DRT), in particular dopamine agonists and to a
lesser extend l-dopa, have been recognized as a major factor in the increase in impulsivity in PD patients.
Accordingly, the main treatment response currently is the decrease or removal of dopamine agonist
medications, which however entails the risk of development of dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome and of
recurrence of more severe motor symptoms. However, when excessive impulsivity results from l-dopa alone
not much can be done currently to control both motor symptoms and impulsivity. For these reasons, more
research is critically needed to better understand the pathophysiology of impulsivity in PD, and to develop
more effective care.
Impulsivity in PD patients has been found to be composed of two main dimensions identified as motor
impulsivity and decision-making impulsivity. This distinction suggests that different neural networks may be
affected across PD patients. Accordingly, the limited effectiveness of current treatments of PD-related ICDs
may be due to divergent pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as to the scarce understanding of how
impulsivity modulates the brain networks associated with decision-making and response planning. Some
studies have investigated the neural mechanisms of motor impulsivity in PD patients, and a few have
investigated those of decision-making impulsivity. However, to our knowledge no study has ever been designed
to investigate specifically how DRT affects the electrophysiological activity within the neural networks
associated with the two main dimensions of impulsivity and how this information can prospectively improve
patient care. With this project, we intend to begin to fill this gap.
We plan to identify the neural signatures of impulsivity in controls and Parkinson's patients using
magnetoencephalography (MEG), which provides high temporal resolution of oscillatory activity over the
whole brain. Subjects will complete questionnaires relative to impulsivity and ICDs, and then perform two
tasks –go/no-go task and Iowa gambling task– assessing the two main dimensions of impulsivity (i.e., motor
impulsivity and decision-making impulsivity, respectively) during MEG recording. Patients will be studied
both on and off their DRT to determine its effect on the networks associated with each dimension of
impulsivity. In addition, these data will be used to create neurophysiological models of the dimensions of
impulsivity in PD patients and compare those to matched controls. Furthermore, we will identify the patterns
of neural activity that covary with the level of dopamine-induced impulsivity. Advancing our understanding of
the brain mechanisms associated with impulsivity in PD will provide a path to more individualized therapy and
better outcomes. It will also define the network nodes involved in impulsivity and ICDs and therefore identify
potential targets for future interventions by transcranial or deep brain stimulation."

Manganese (Mn) plays an essential role in normal growth and development The Communities Actively
Researching Exposure Study (CARES) was built upon community-engaged research practices. Participants
reside in three communities with the nation's highest levels of ambient Mn: Marietta and East Liverpool, Ohio,
and Southeast Side Chicago, Illinois. The CARES cohort consists of over 600 children and their primary
caregiver, with two time-points (ages 7-9 years and ages 13-17 years) of extensive neurodevelopmental
outcomes, biomarkers of exposure, and home environmental measures. The CARES has been supported by
multiple NIEHS-funded grants and has been instrumental in the training of next generation community-
engaged environmental health scientists for over a decade. The cohort has been instrumental in the
development of a lab-on-a-chip sensor for blood metals assessment and is currently exploring the impact of
Mn on neuroanatomy, function, chemistry, and physiology through magnetic resonance imaging. Through this
project, the CARES research team will be able to conduct the following: Aim 1) Maintain the integrity of the
CARES cohort by implementing community-engaged research strategies to improve participant retention; Aim
2) Expand CARES to enhance characterization of critical windows of exposure across the lifespan, and assess
the role of caregiver, child, and community-level psychosocial factors on the etiology of toxicant-induced
neurodevelopmental deficits; and Aim 3) Maintain and enhance biorepository and data management
infrastructure and develop methods to implement data sharing. The CARES is the only cohort poised to
investigate ambient exposure to Mn and its relationship to brain function in both a pediatric and adolescent
population. The proposed cohort retention, enhancement, and maintenance plans will accelerate and sustain
the ability of the CARES cohort to investigate the impact of ambient Mn on neurodevelopmental outcomes,
inform federal polices related to ambient exposure to Mn, and serve as a valuable resource for environmental
health science trainees and scientists across the globe."

10830179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic suppurative respiratory disease is characterized by persistent and recurrent otitis media, sinusitis,
bronchitis as well as bronchiectasis. Genetic etiologies include inborn errors of immunity (IEI) with defective
cellular and antibody-mediated responses and disorders of impaired mucociliary clearance like primary ciliary
clearance (PCD). Early and accurate diagnosis of these genetic etiologies can lead to more effective prevention
of recurring infections, functional decline, and structural respiratory tract damage. Prior studies conducted by the
NIH-funded Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) focused on characterizing
patients presenting with suspected PCD. These led to better understanding of the clinical phenotype and
contributed to the discovery and characterization of over 50 genes causing this disease. Those studies also
showed that some patients presenting with signs and symptoms of PCD actually had milder or later onset
manifestations of IEI identified genetically. This project seeks to complement the extensive PCD clinical, genetic
and management experience of the GDMCC with the corresponding IEI expertise of the NIAID Sequencing and
Primary Immune Deficiency Programs to test our central hypothesis that tiered clinical and genetic evaluation of
patients with suppurative respiratory disease will identify people whose confirmed genetic diagnosis of PCD or
IEI requires whole genome sequencing and expertise in variant significance resolution. Utilizing patients
identified from a multicenter GDMCC suppurative respiratory disease protocol, we propose the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Assess the potential of Whole genome sequencing (WGS) for diagnosis of IEI or PCD in
patients who have undergone a systematic evaluation for suppurative respiratory tract disease and have
negative commercial IEI and PCD gene testing panels. Expertise in variant curation and significance
resolution for gene variants not currently categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic will be utilized to confirm
the genetic diagnoses. Specific Aim 2: Referral of GDMCC patients to the NIH Clinical Center for NIAID
protocol directed clinical, laboratory, or genetic diagnostic evaluation will facilitate confirmation of
genetic IEI diagnosis. Patients will have the opportunity to participate in NIAID protocols designed to more
precisely define immune disorders at the NIH Clinical Center. Specific Aim 3: Referral of GDMCC IEI patients
to the NIH Clinical Center for NIAID protocol directed biologic, gene correctional or transplant treatment
will enhance therapeutic options. Patients diagnosed with a genetic IEI will have access to potential lifesaving
therapeutic advances. The collaborative efforts between the multi-site GDMCC based at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and the NIAID Centralized Sequencing Program, and Primary Immune Deficiency
Program based at the NIH Clinical Center will lead to improved genetic diagnostic capabilities and optimization
of management strategies for patients presenting with chronic suppurative respiratory disease."
10832672,"This study aims to examine the neurodevelopmental consequences (specifically risk for ADHD phenotypes) of
prenatal maternal air pollution exposure and to examine two potential mechanisms, prenatal maternal
inflammation and offspring sleep disruptions. Epidemiological studies support this association; however,
studies have yet to determine (1) important exposure periods, (2) pollutant exposure effects independent of
socio-economic status and adversity, (3) offspring sex effects, and (4) the underlying mechanisms. Air pollution
exposure is often higher in disadvantaged communities; studies that do not consider the socioeconomic and
adversity history of participants run the risk of reporting confounded effects. We will address gaps by
examining the influence of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on neurodevelopment (via MRI) while controlling for
postnatal PM2.5, critical environmental aspects (intergenerational adversity, SES, family functioning), and
polygenetic ADHD risk. We will examine offspring brain white matter twice, in infancy (~2 weeks) and in
childhood (2-9 yrs). We will work within a two-generation, epidemiological cohort of Puerto Ricans that has
been followed since 2000 and carefully characterized for adversity, family functioning, and psychiatric illness.
We will study BYS-ECHO children (Generation 2; G2's), who are currently being scanned during infancy
(UH3OD023328) and propose to re-assess white matter development in toddlerhood (n=84; 12-24 mos) or
childhood (n=98; 6-9yrs). We will index the effects of mother’s prenatal PM2.5 exposure estimated using highly
resolved spatio-temporal prediction models (and supplemented by real-time air quality data via portable
sensors in a sub-sample) on G2’s ADHD-related neurocircuitry and phenotypes, while controlling for the
aforementioned variables. The overarching aim of this study is to examine the neurodevelopmental
consequences of prenatal PM2.5 exposure and test two proposed underlying mechanisms: (Aim1) prenatal
maternal inflammation, OR (Aim 2) sleep deficits in offspring (measured via in-home actigraphy assessments).
Maternal inflammation is a prenatal mechanism, thus we hypothesize in Aim 1 that neurocircuitry alterations
will be present in both infancy and toddler/childhood MRIs. Because offspring sleep is a postnatal mechanism,
in this alterative (Aim 2) hypothesis we predict alterations in ADHD neurocircuitry in toddler/childhood, but not
in newborns. It is also possible we find support for both aims, in which case we would be uniquely poised to
examine cumulative and interactive effects. We will also test the moderating role of infant sex (Aim 3), and
based on pre-clinical studies, hypothesize that males would demonstrate more susceptibility to prenatal air
pollution. This study will be the first to utilize infant longitudinal neuroimaging to understand prenatal air
pollution exposure. We will be uniquely able to disassociate the effects of prenatal PM2.5 exposure from those
of postnatal factors and PM2.5 on brain development, and to test two putative mechanisms, both of which are
potential modifiable targets for intervention."
10832674,"Abstract.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital viral infections. HCMV’s ability to
infect the placenta plays a central role in its pathogenesis during pregnancy. Placental infection can be
sufficient to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes and is likely a prerequisite to congenital cytomegalovirus
infection. The placenta is resistant to viral infection in part due to the antiviral activity of trophoblasts. These
fetal-derived cells form the physical barrier that separates maternal and fetal circulation and secrete a variety
of factors, including type III interferon, exosomes, and antimicrobial peptides, that collectively defend the
maternal-fetal interface from infection. However, HCMV can replicate in trophoblasts and may injure the
placenta either by directly infecting and killing trophoblasts or by stimulating an injurious maternal or fetal
immune response. Two preliminary studies have led us to hypothesize that trophoblast differentiation
sensitizes the placenta to infection-associated injury late in gestation. Firstly, we have found that human
trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) can be infected by HCMV but are not permissive to replication. Transcriptome
profiling revealed that, like other embryonic and multipotent stem cells, TSCs constitutively express a subset of
interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Suspecting that one or more of these factors protect TSCs and their
derivatives from HCMV during early differentiation, we will conduct an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen to
identify HCMV restriction factors in these cells. Follow up studies will use targeted mutagenesis to study how
ISG deletion affects the sensitivity of TSCs, TSC-derived trophoblasts, and trophoblast organoids to infection.
Separately, studies in a guinea pig model of congenital cytomegalovirus infection revealed that maternal
infection after mid-gestation causes a unique pattern of viral infection in the placenta and a transcriptional
response that implicates placental immunopathology as a cause of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction.
Infection at an earlier time point had no apparent ill effect on the guinea pig placenta. Thus, we will complete a
longitudinal study that examines the effect of maternal cytomegalovirus infection at three different times--
pre/peri-implantation, at the end of the embryonic period, and after mid-gestation--on placental development
and function. To complement traditional assays of viral load and placental histopathology, we will use spatial
transcriptomics to longitudinally study gene expression in the guinea pig placenta at an unprecedented
resolution and elucidate how infection affects the distinct regions of the placenta. Collectively, these studies will
reveal how placental susceptibility to viral infection varies across gestation and identify targets for therapeutic
interventions that are designed to prevent infection-associated adverse fetal outcomes."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease, is characterized by

10833543,"Chronic liver disease and its common sequela cirrhosis, are growing public health concerns, and major risk
factors for the development of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). HCC incidence and mortality is growing in the
USA. Optimal medical therapies for HCC are lacking. FDA approved agents are modestly effective. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including PD-1 inhibitors Nivolumab and Pembrozilumab, have been both
approved and show good response rates but only in a subset of HCC cases. Biomarkers of response remain
unknown. Recent years have seen a revolution in HCC GWAS studies to identify molecular drivers. Mutations
in CTNNB1 activate b-catenin in the Wnt pathway & seen in up to 37% of HCCs. However, b-catenin activation
alone does not lead to HCC. Analysis of 2 large HCC cohorts (TCGA & French) revealed CTNNB1 mutations to
co-occur with alterations in MET, MYC, TERT, NFE2L2, MLL2, ARID2 & APOB. Overexpression/activation of
Met along with CTNNB1 mutations is seen in ~11% of HCCs. Coexpression of these genes in a subset of
hepatocytes using sleeping beauty transposon/transposase (SB) & hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HTVI) led
to HCC by 6 weeks in mice (hMet-b-catenin model). Gene expression analysis confirmed 70% similarity
between hMet-b-catenin model and HCC patient subset with Met activation & CTNNB1 mutations. In aim 1,
we will generate and characterize mouse models using SB/Crispr and HTVI to co-express mutant CTNNB1 and
other genes frequently co-altered in subsets of human HCC including MYC, TERT, NFE2L2, MLL2, ARID2, &
APOB. We already show HCC development in Met-b-catenin, MYC-b-catenin, TERT-b-catenin & NFE2L2-b-
catenin, while others are ongoing. Comparison of gene expression between mouse models and human HCC
subsets will validate the relevance of these models justifying a more comprehensive cellular & molecular
characterization for innovative therapies. We will also test dependence of all mutant CTNNB1-mouse models to
b-catenin by using of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) containing CTNNB1-siRNA (CTNNB1-LNP) to suppress b-
catenin and assess response as we have shown for Kras-b-catenin (akin to hMet-b-catenin) model. In aim 2, we
will focus on b-catenin-glutamine synthetase (GS)-glutamine-mTORC1 axis in mutant-CTNNB1 HCC, recently
discovered and reported by us (Publication in Cell Metabolism). All mutant-CTNNB1 driven HCC models with
all co-occurrences will be tested for response to mTORC1 inhibitors like Everolimus and RM-006 (novel
exclusive mTORC1 inhibitor) and to upstream GS via genetic deletion of GS in established HCCs or via use of
irreversible GS inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine (MSO) and glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 that hampers
production of glutamate, a substrate for GS to generate glutamine. In aim 3, we will investigate how to make b-
catenin-active HCCs shown by us to be resistant to ICIs (publication in Cancer Discovery), sensitive to ICIs
through use of combination therapy. Using an immunogenic Myc-lucOS-mutant-b-catenin HCC model, that is
resistant to PD-1 inhibitor, we will test role of concomitant b-catenin suppression via CTNNB1-LNP, mTORC1
inhibition via Everolimus or GS inhibition via MSO, as sensitizing agents to PD-1 inhibitor. Thus overall, our
proposal will develop clinically relevant and validated preclinical models utilizing mutant b-catenin as one
cooperating oncogene and demonstrate role of mutant b-catenin in regulating tumor metabolism and immune
microenvironment. Completion of ours study will thus provide justification for targeting b-catenin in a notable
subset of HCC patients through innovative therapies and eventually pave the way for personalized medicine."
10833653,"SUMMARY
Mutations in splicing factors (SF) are highly enriched in a variety of cancer types, particularly myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in addition to solid
tumors such as uveal melanoma. Our group has identified that cells bearing SF mutations cannot tolerate
further perturbations to splicing catalysis and, consistent with this, we have identified that spliceosomal mutant
cancer cells are preferentially sensitive to small molecules that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing.
While the above effort has resulted in an ongoing phase I clinical trial of a spliceosome modulatory compound
for patients with refractory myeloid leukemias, we do not currently know the safety or efficacy of pharmacologic
modulation of core spliceosome function. To this end, our group has also recently identified that inhibiting
spliceosomal assembly through inhibition of arginine methylation of Sm proteins provides an alternate means
of therapeutic splicing inhibition. We have identified that inhibiting either symmetric arginine methylation
(mediated by the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)) or asymmetric dimethyl arginine methylation
(mediated by type I PRMTs (PRMT1, 4, and 6)) reduces splicing fidelity resulting in strong preferential killing of
SF-mutant leukemias over their wildtype counterparts.
Here we aim to determine if in leukemia, SF-mutations portend greater vulnerability to a “second hit” targeting
splicing through inhibition of type I (PRMT1/4/6) and/or type II (PRMT5) PRMTs. In Aim 1 we will define the
therapeutic potential of inhibiting PRMT5, type I PRMTs, and core spliceosome function, alone or together in
leukemia models with or without a SF mutation. In addition, we will understand the consequences of combined
PRMT inhibition on RNA splicing and gene expression relative to inhibiting PRMT5 or Type I PRMTs alone.
In parallel to the above studies, in Aim 2, we will define the molecular basis for the cooperation between PRMT
inhibition and SF mutations, by first determining the methylation substrates of PRMT5 or Type I PRMTs, and
secondly by determining if individual spliceosomal changes mediated by inhibiting PRMTs or core spliceosome
function can be mimicked by anti-sense oligonucleotides, thereby providing an orthogonal novel therapeutic
approach to eliminate SF-mutant cancer cells.
The significance of these studies is that inhibitors of PRMTs are now entering phase I clinical trials in patients
with a variety of cancer types and defining the mechanistic effects and therapeutic utility of PRMT inhibitors for
specific genetic subsets of cancers may have incredible therapeutic importance. The health relatedness is
that our studies may identify new therapeutic opportunities for a variety of cancer types that have no curative
therapies for the majority of patients with these diseases currently."
10833657,"Juvenile justice officers (JJOs)—responsible for the over 1 million youth arrested each year in the U.S.—face
exceptionally high chronic workplace stress. This stress is implicated in a constellation of adverse outcomes
underpinned by emotion dysregulation: depression, anxiety, and workplace burnout. Importantly, JJO workforces
are comprised heavily of Black/African American and Latinx employees, and these same groups face disparities
in mental health symptoms and burnout compared with peers from other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Interventions
that address the effects of chronic workplace stress among JJOs thus stand to yield meaningful public health
benefit while helping redress health disparities. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improve emotion
regulation and reduce depression, anxiety, and burnout. JJOs express strong interest in MBIs, which can be
tailored and delivered to employees during their workdays via mobile health (mHealth) technology. This project
will adapt an MBI smartphone app for delivery to JJOs based on empirically-supported adaptation targets, and
will conduct a feasibility clinical trial. It will build on parallel procedures and technology developed through a prior
NIH award to adapt and test an MBI app for arrested youth, offering a unique, efficient, and cost-effective
opportunity. The study will take place in Chicago Cook County, the 2nd largest juvenile justice system in the U.S.,
where the study team has conducted NIH-funded research for 18 years. To guide adaptation and implementation
of the app, the team will conduct key informant interviews rooted in a theoretically-driven implementation science
framework. Interviews will be held on both the individual (JJO) and organizational (leadership) levels. The team
will work with professional programmers to translate the interview findings into a secure app adapted from
existing source code. For the feasibility clinical trial, JJOs (n=50) will be individually randomized to use the
adapted MBI app or an equally intensive control app daily for 30 days. In-app analytics will capture objective use
of each app feature. An adaptive intervention design will be employed to engage non-users of both apps,
whereby analytics data indicating non-use will trigger delivery of an enhanced engagement strategy (e.g., text
messages encouraging use). Mental health symptoms and burnout among JJOs will be assessed at baseline,
1, and 6 months via self-report. JJOs will also complete 1-week “bursts” of ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) of their objective contexts and affective states at baseline and 1 month in order to capture the mechanistic
target (i.e., emotion dysregulation) in the workplace. At 1 month, both JJOs and leadership will report on
acceptability and feasibility via an in-depth, mixed-methods design. Completion of this study will develop building
blocks for high-impact, large-scale trials that formally evaluate the adapted MBI app. The use of theoretically-
driven implementation science principles coupled with mHealth technology will position the MBI app to be
sustainable and scalable across diverse juvenile justice systems, improving the health trajectories of their
frontline workers."

Celiac disease (CeD) is a gluten-induced inflammatory disorder of the small intestine for which no non-dietary
therapy has been approved for clinical use. In this ongoing collaborative project, we study the pathogenic role
of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a validated drug target for CeD, through a synergistic combination of tools and
concepts from chemical biology and mucosal immunology. During the past grant cycle, we have uncovered
a novel pathway by which antigenic gluten peptides are potently escorted into the endosomes of antigen
presenting cells through the formation of complexes involving TG2, 2-macroglobulin (2M), and low density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). In the next cycle, we will characterize this mechanism for TG2-
dependent inflammatory T cell activation through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Structure-function analysis of molecular interactions involved in LRP1-mediated gluten antigen
presentation: We will biochemically characterize how a representative intermediate formed between TG2 and
a gluten peptide is recognized by 2M. Our goal is to define the molecular features facilitating 2M-TG2
recognition and the role of the peptide in this three-component interaction. Separately, we will also study how
the resulting peptide-TG2-2M complex is recognized and endocytosed by the LRP1 receptor.
Aim 2: Defining the pathogenic role of the LRP1 pathway for gluten peptide uptake in CeD pathogenesis:
While LRP1-mediated gluten antigen endocytosis has been studied in cultured cells, we do not know the
identities of small intestinal cells that deamidate and take up gluten peptides and present them to CeD-specific
T cells. Using fluorogenic peptides and peptidomimetics that undergo LRP1-mediated endocytosis, we will
identify intestinal cells that exhibit this property in selected strains of mice. In turn, we will leverage mouse
models developed through the support of this grant to examine the role of the TG2-2M-LRP1 pathway in the
loss of oral tolerance to dietary gluten as well as the onset of gluten-induced villous atrophy.
Not only does our proposed research offer the promise of breaking fundamentally new ground in our
understanding of CeD pathogenesis, but the resulting tools and methods could be leveraged to investigate
the relevance of the TG2-2M-LRP1 endocytic pathway in other patho-physiological situations."
10833714,"ABSTRACT
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a
polymorphic CAG repeat in the HTT gene that triggers cell death with specificity towards neurons in the
striatum and cortex. Although the underlying genetic mutation was discovered over 25 years ago, there is still
no cure or effective treatment despite extensive efforts. The HTT CAG repeat mutation is highly unstable both
in transmissions to subsequent generations and somatically. Notably the repeat undergoes dramatic tissue-
specific somatic expansion, particularly in the brain regions affected in the disorder, strongly suggesting that
somatic HTT CAG length increases in target tissues contribute to HD pathogenesis. Recent human genetic
data provide compelling support for somatic CAG expansion as a driver of the rate of HD pathogenesis,
identifying DNA repair genes as modifiers of disease onset in HD patients, many of which modify somatic CAG
expansion in accurate genetic HD knock-in mouse models. In this study, we will perform experiments to deeply
interrogate these modifier genes at a number of fundamental levels. In Aim 1 we will use genetic experiments
in the mouse to test the impact of altering somatic expansion on disease expression. In Aim 2, we will perform
biochemical studies in patient cells and in mouse models to understand the mechanism of action and
functional consequences a human modifier variant. In Aim 3 we will examine the impacts of human modifier
variation on CAG instability and gene expression in specific cell types in the brain. Together, these
experiments that are driven by human genetic data, will provide critical insight into mechanisms of disease
modification in HD and will guide development of therapeutics targeting CAG expansion."
10843276,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Genetic mutations underlie many lung
diseases. For instance, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene can
directly cause cystic fibrosis (CF) or increase the risk of other non-CF lung diseases, like chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma. To date, over 2,000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, classified
as CF-causing or non-CF-causing polymorphisms. Correcting CF-causing mutations and exploring the function
of non-CF-causing polymorphisms could help treat a wide range of lung diseases.
CRISPR-associated base editing mediates the irreversible conversion of A>G (Adenine Base Editor, ABE) or
C>T (Cytidine Base Editor, CBE). The goal of this proposal is to use base editing to correct CF-causing CFTR
mutations in CF primary cells and mouse models, and to investigate whether non-CF-causing polymorphisms
affect CFTR activity and lung cell function. Preliminary data show that ABE can correct a CF-causing nonsense
mutation (W1282X) to restore CFTR expression and function in immortalized human lung epithelial cells. In the
K99 phase, ABE will be delivered to a clinically-relevant cell model, CF patient-derived primary bronchial
epithelial cell line, to correct W1282X, and rigorous off-target analysis will be performed to study the efficiency
and specificity of ABE (Aim 1). Moreover, an in vivo delivery method targeting lung airways will be developed by
packaging an intein-split ABE system into AAV5 (Aim 2). The delivery efficiency will be tested in wild type
C57BL/6 mice. GFP-CFTR reporter cell lines will also be established using CRISPR-mediated homology directed
repair method to integrate a GFP sequence to CFTR genomic locus (Aim 3). Research in the mentored phase
will be performed under the guidance of an esteemed mentor committee, whose expertise range from CRISPR
engineering and application to pulmonary biology. By the R00 phase, the PI will be ready to establish an
independent laboratory focused on using base editing techniques to study point mutations in lung disease.
During the R00 phase, AAV5-ABE will be delivered to W1282X CF mice to determine its potential as a novel
gene therapy method to correct an “untreatable” CFTR mutation in CF (Aim 2). Furthermore, non-CF-causing
mutations will be introduced by CBE in lung airway epithelial cells to understand how they affect CFTR
expression, localization, and function, and how they respond to known CFTR modulator drugs – e.g. ivacaftor
(Aim 3). These studies will reveal if and how non-CF-causing mutations contribute to lung disease, and suggest
potential treatment approaches for lung diseases associated with non-CF-causing mutations. Collectively, the
proposed studies will shed light on diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases that are associated with CFTR
polymorphisms. This project will foster the PI’s continued scientific and professional training and facilitate her
transition to independence."
10834002,"Many individuals in our Veteran population, especially the Vietnam era cohort, suffer from dementia-related
cognitive impairment. This number is expected to increase as the population of Veterans age. Developing
effective treatment strategies is of the upmost importance, as this impairment places a huge burden on the
Veterans themselves, their caregivers, and the resources of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Repetitive
transcranial magenetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising treatment strategy, that utilizes electromagnetics
to noninvasively activate cortical cells and restore cognitive functioning. It is thought that this process
increases neurotrophic signaling throughout the brain, and could potentially increase the integrity of brain
structures sensitive to a loss in neurotrophic factors, especially those structures that declince early in the
course of Alzhiemer's disease (AD).
This proposal aims to improve our understanding of the neurochemistry of cognitive decline, and
subsequently, rehabilitation from rTMS treatment using both human and animal models. We will assess
changes in the neurotrophic factor Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) as a result of AD and how
rTMS treatment influences BDNF signaling. The role of this measure will be related to cognitive
performance in both humans and mice. We will first assess the extent of changes in BDNF signaling in a
mouse model of AD, and then we will implement an rTMS system for mice to increase BDNF in the brains of
these mice. This system will be used to test the brain neurochemistry of changes in cognitive function in AD.
Utilization of a mouse model will allow us to comprehensively investigate neurochemistry in a controlled
experimental settting. Specifically, we will measure alterations in the signaling pathway of BDNF in a mouse
model of AD for both rTMS-treated and control mice. We will also determine if rTMS can be utilized to
prevent AD pathology in these mice by providing long-term treatment, and measuring both biochemical
changes and cognitive performance. Finally, BDNF will be measured in blood samples from humans with
cognitive impairment either treated with rTMS or a sham in order to related biochemistry to changes in
human cognitive dysfunction. Exploratory research on key proteins from cerebral spinal fluid and plasma in
humans will pave the way for future funding opportunities in the biochemistry of cognition.
Results from this proposal will provide valuable insight into the biochemical mechanisms of cognitive
decline. This research will also identify key biomarkers that can be related to cognitive performance and be
utilized as concrete measures of treatment outcome. The combination of biochemical and cognitive
measurements on both humans and animals provides an innovative, multi-faceted approach that can be
directly translated into medical treatments for our Veterans."

cholestatic liver failure that is fatal without liver transplantation. Because patients are sensitive to visible light
and not UV light, sunscreen is not effective in EPP. Afamelanotide, which increases cutaneous melanin, was
recently approved by the FDA for the prevention of photosensitivity in EPP. Additional therapies besides
afamelanotide are necessary because afamelanotide is does not change PPIX level and therefore does not
prevent the life-threatening complications of EPP. Cimetidine has gained attention as a possible treatment for
human porphyrias because of a potential off-target effect of inhibition of ALAS, the first enzyme of heme
biosynthesis. This inhibition was first described in vitro. Later case reports suggested that cimetidine was
beneficial for the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda. Subsequently, case
reports also described a potential effect in EPP. However, these reports are anecdotal and uncontrolled. Some
patients also had pre-existing hepatic damage from EPP, which complicates the observations of drug effects in
EPP. Communications in the porphyria community indicate that a large number of patients, including children,
have used cimetidine without oversight and without a systematic record of dosage or symptomatic
improvement. The considerable interest in the larger porphyria community to assess with care its possible
benefit as a treatment approach has therefore neither been addressed nor satisfied. Therefore, the objective of
this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of oral cimetidine administration in the protoporphyrias. The
study design is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, and
efficacy will be based on protoporphyrin levels, photosensitivity, and quality of life questionnaires. If the results
are positive, this would be the first study providing quality evidence for an agent acting as a disease-modifying
therapy for protoporphyria."

This competitive renewal application is for continuation of the Training Program in Psychiatric
Genetics and Translational Research, offered by the Departments of Epidemiology,
Biostatistics, and Social & Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health. The principal objectives of the training grant are to educate promising pre- and
postdoctoral trainees as quantitative scientists in psychiatric research, with two focus areas:
psychiatric genetics and analytical methods for translational research. This renewal expands the
training program to include the Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences in order to
strengthen the program’s focus on translational research, particularly with reference to social
epidemiology, diverse populations, and understanding social disparities. We aim to train
psychiatrists and other mental health researchers in methods relevant to these fields, and to
train methodologists working in these areas with genuine engagement in psychiatric research
and an understanding of psychiatric diagnosis, assessment, and outcomes. The Departments of
Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Social & Behavioral Sciences have an accomplished faculty
who have worked collaboratively in genetics and translational research for many years. We also
draw on the expertise of Harvard faculty from other world-renown institutions, including Harvard
Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham & Women’s Hospital, and McLean
Hospital. These collaborations offer a rich source of ongoing projects for student and
postdoctoral training. We are requesting a total of seven trainees across the three departments,
three predoctoral and four postdoctoral (typically two clinical scientists [psychiatrist or clinical
psychologist] seeking a masters or doctoral degree and two traditional postdoctoral fellows).
Training will be a combination of coursework, seminars, practica, and independent and
collaborative research in mental health. High-level training in the core disciplines of
epidemiology, biostatistics, and social and behavioral research, properly accounting for diversity
and health disparities is critical to leadership of mental health research in the coming decades."
10834397,"Project Summary/Abstract
 At cell division, the cell must accurately segregate its chromosomes to its two daughter cells. To
do so, the cell builds the spindle, with kinetochores connecting spindle microtubules to chromosomes.
The kinetochore is a macromolecular complex that performs both physical and biochemical roles: it
must resist and transmit force as microtubules pull on it to move chromosomes, and must also process
microtubule signals to control cell cycle progression. Errors in this process lead to aneuploidy, which
can then result in disease and birth defects.
 The kinetochore is assembled hierarchically: inner kinetochore proteins bind centromeric
histones, and outer kinetochore proteins assemble on this inner plate, eventually binding microtubules.
While much is known about the mammalian kinetochore’s architecture and composition, little is known
about its mechanics. Yet, its functions are mechanical – to segregate chromosomes. The kinetochore
is under varied forces, for example from different microtubule attachment states. How the kinetochore
structurally responds to different forces – and maintains its structure and function under force – is poorly
understood. In large part, this is because we cannot as yet purify the mammalian kinetochore in vitro,
where quantitative mechanical approaches exist. Recent progress in our lab to measure kinetochore
shape with high space and time resolution in vivo under natural forces brings this question within reach.
 Here, we propose to test physical and molecular models for how kinetochores maintain their
structure while under force. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that kinetochore shape changes
originate in the inner kinetochore, and are due to high forces. We will do this by using live super
resolution imaging of inner and outer kinetochore proteins, and analyzing their shapes, movement, and
under how much force they are under (using centromere stretch as a proxy). In Aim 2, we will test
hypotheses on the molecular basis of kinetochore structural integrity under force: basal stability from
the centromere and lateral inner kinetochore reinforcement. To do so, we will use chemical and genetic
perturbations of candidate mechanisms, and use the same imaging approach as in Aim 1 to ask
whether these perturbations change the kinetochore’s shape under force.
 Overall, we aim to uncover the physical and molecular basis of the kinetochore’s ability to
maintain its structure and function under force. This will not only help us understand how the
kinetochore’s function emerges from its structure, but ultimately how its malfunctions can emerge from
structural failures in disease contexts. Key to this proposal, this work will provide training in biophysics,
quantitative microscopy, molecular approaches, mentorship, and science communication to graduate
student Vanna Tran towards her goals of becoming an independent group leader."

 Approximately 10% of people in the U.S. suffer from infertility, about half of whom are thought to have a
genetic basis. However, the underlying causes remain undetermined in the great majority of patients.
Traditional methods for identifying inherited disease loci, such as GWAS, have been confounded by
heterogeneity of infertility phenotypes and the large numbers of genes involved in reproduction. Nevertheless,
there are probably numerous “infertility” alleles segregating in populations, affecting diverse processes at all
stages of gamete development. Our goal is to identify these alleles, their nature, and their in vivo impacts to
reproduction. Under previous funding, we used a radically different approach to the problem that involved
prediction and modeling of human coding variants biochemically and in mice. Here, we propose to employ
innovative strategies for identifying and characterizing infertility variants (particularly SNPs) that segregate as
minor alleles in populations. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in high-throughput genomics, reproductive
genetics, proteomics, computational biology, and transcriptional regulation has been assembled to identify both
protein-coding and regulatory variants affecting “fertility” genes. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Use
computational approaches and high-throughput in vitro assays to identify nonsynonymous SNPs in human
reproduction genes that are likely to disrupt protein function. These alleles will be precisely modeled in mice
using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and thoroughly phenotyped to inform patient diagnosis. 2) Exploit
subfertile mouse models of human variants, exhibiting decreased chiasmata, to understand mechanisms of
premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and recurrent pregnancy loss. 3) Identify human germ cell regulatory
variants via indentification of active (eRNA-transcribing) enhancers using ChRO-seq technology, followed by
mouse transgenic assays. We will also identify eQTL residing in gametogenesis promoters by exploiting GTEx,
high-throughput vector-building technology, and expression assays.
 Successful execution of this project would constitute the most comprehensive study ever conducted to
identify and validate both coding and non-coding genetic variants in human populations that contribute to
infertility in both sexes. Since the variants are carried by millions of people collectively, this project can have a
major and lasting impact on the field of reproductive genetics in the precision genomics era."

Based on World Health Organization estimates, the annual rate of preterm birth (PTB) is greater
than 10% in the majority of countries. Premature birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation
is the leading cause of mortality in the first year of life and is associated with morbidity that has
life-long cognitive consequences. Acute and lifespan care costs associated with preterm births
have broad and sustained effects on families and are enormously expensive for society. Causes
of PTB are multifactorial, but the single most common cause of PTB is inflammation. Sadly,
there is currently no United States Food and Drug Administration approved drug for the
prevention of PTB. One of the hurdles in translational research and drug development in this
field is the risk of drug related toxicity affecting the fetus. Several years ago, we made the
fortuitous discovery that the safe pharmaceutical solvent, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), prevents
PTB and rescues pups from spontaneous abortion in our mouse model. Further studies in our
laboratory revealed that DMA suppresses nuclear translocation and activation of nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-kB), a transcription factor that regulates immune cell-mediated inflammation. In
addition, we have shown that DMA attenuates cytokine secretion from cultured human
trophoblasts and from human placental explants. Recently, our laboratory has teamed up with our
collaborator’s to develop a vaginal (pv) self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS),
which takes advantage of the first uterine/cervix pass effect to deliver drugs introduced into the
vaginal cavity directly to the cervix and uterus, thereby minimizing risk of systemic toxicity and
teratogenicity. The specific aims of the current project are to 1) test the effects of our pv DMA
SNEDDS on histomorphology and inflammatory responses in the cervix in a murine model; 2)
determine the molecular mechanism whereby DMA inhibits NF-kB transcriptional activity; and 3)
compare toxic and teratogenic effects of a DMA SNEDDS to intraperitoneal administration of
DMA. To accomplish these aims, we assembled a team of experts in PTB, cervix histomorphology
and drug formulation. This multidisciplinary team will be working alongside our students, who
come from a diverse and underserved population. Although PTB is a global public health problem,
rates of PTB are significantly higher among underserved populations. The novelty of re-purposing
a readily available and inexpensive common drug excipient to prevent PTB, together with
designing a vaginal formulation that can be administered by patients remote from clinics or
hospitals, addresses a critical gap in the field of drug development for PTB."

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) represent a spectrum of disorders that cause significant
morbidity in persons living with HIV (PLWH). While the prevalence of HIV-associated dementia has
significantly decreased since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), milder forms of HAND are quite
common among individuals on ART. The molecular, cellular, and viral contributions to the pathogenesis of
HAND remain incompletely understood. HIV readily infects microglia of the central nervous system (CNS), and
there is evidence from animal models that microglial infection occurs within days of acute infection. Microglia
are mobile and frequently interact with other cells within the CNS, potentially mediating transmission of HIV to
uninfected cells. Recent advances in cerebral organoid development provide a means of dissecting virus-cell
and cell-cell interactions in the CNS that may be relevant to the development of HAND, including mechanisms
of cell-cell transmission of virus. Our laboratory has been studying iPSC-derived microglia in order to define
how HIV attaches to and infects this cell type. Siglec-1 is an interferon (IFN)-inducible molecule that attaches
to gangliosides on the HIV-1 lipid bilayer, leading to subsequent internalization and formation of the virus-
containing compartment (VCC) in monocyte-derived macrophages and facilitating transmission of virus to T
cells. In this project, we will define the role of Siglec-1 in mediating HIV interactions with iPSC-derived
microglia, including its role in infection of microglia and trans-infection to uninfected microglia, T cells,
macrophages, and potentially to astrocytes. Novel SIGLEC1 knockout iPSC lines will be utilized to provide new
insights into Siglec-1 in CNS infection and inflammation. Experiments will then be extended to cerebral
organoid models, and the contribution of microglial capture of HIV and microglial infection to cerebral
inflammation assessed in both 2D and 3D organoids. The effects of fentanyl exposure of HIV-infected
microglia and organoids will be analyzed, and may alter IFN signaling and the dynamics of HIV spread and
inflammation in CNS tissues. Together, these studies will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HAND,
and identify novel therapeutic targets for this important group of disorders."

Alzheimer’s disease is a disease of neurodegeneration and aging that affects millions of Americans, and is
expected to impact millions more without further significant breakthroughs.1 However, much of the etiology
and progression of Alzheimer’s is still unclear, especially given the complex interactions of many different
molecular, cellular, and environmental cues that are correlated with phenotypic outcomes. An emerging focus
in Alzheimer’s study is the role of the cerebrovasculature in the initiation, progression, and exacerbation of
symptomatic disease.2-4 Disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which tightly controls any exchange between
systemic circulation and brain tissue, has manifested in post-mortem and in vivo studies of late-stage
Alzheimer’s disease as microbleeds, dysfunctional glucose transport, and impaired efflux of toxins;5 additional
animal studies have indicated that some vascular dysfunction precedes neuronal degeneration in the
progression of the disease.6, 7 Thus, to understand the drivers and progression of Alzheimer’s disease in
hopes of identifying therapeutic breakpoints, the role of blood-brain barrier dysfunction must be investigated.
To do so, we propose using a tissue-engineered model of the blood-brain barrier with high spatiotemporal
resolution to assess its dysfunction under three key categories of perturbation associated with Alzheimer’s
disease. These perturbations will span cell-intrinsic mutations associated with Alzheimer’s (APP(Swe) and
PSEN(M146V)), extrinsic cues of oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide exposure), and the systemic influence of
aged blood components (exposure to aged vs. young human serum). We hypothesize that this combinatorial
approach will best recapitulate human BBB phenotype in Alzheimer’s, and allow for modular study of each
contributor. These perturbations will be compared transcriptomically, proteomically, and functionally.
Transcriptomic changes will be studied through bulk RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis to
highlight similarities to published human datasets, identify hallmark pathways that are impacted by Alzheimer’s
cues, and motivate functional assay design for further validation in the tissue-engineered model. Proteomic
and functional assessments include changes to barrier function, cell identity, and validation of pathways
implicated by transcriptomic analysis. This study will provide a deeper understanding of the role of the blood-
brain barrier in Alzheimer’s progression and emphasize candidate targets for future intervention.
This project and related research training will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Peter Searson at Johns
Hopkins University and the Institute for Nanobiotechnology. Skills including functional assay design, stem cell
differentiation, microfabrication, and RNA-sequencing analysis will be supported by the educational resources
available within the institution. Additional goals of the fellowship training period will incorporate professional
development for future career success, with an emphasis on communication, mentorship, and leadership skills."
10835049,"Project Summary/Abstract
The available antifungal drugs against invasive fungal infections are limited due to the challenge in selectively
killing eukaryotic pathogens without harming humans. Chitin synthases (CHSs) represent one of few proven
targets whose inhibition provides highly selective antifungal effects without any detectable toxicity to humans.
CHSs are transmembrane processive glycosyltransferases (GTs) responsible for the biosynthesis of chitin, an
essential polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall. Due to their essential function in fungal physiology,
CHSs are targeted by naturally occurring peptidyl nucleoside (PN) antifungal agents. PNs exhibit in vivo activities
against multiple endemic fungal pathogens without adverse effects on humans, and exhibit a strong synergy with
current FDA-approved antifungal drugs. However, their development has been slow because of only moderate
antifungal activities against more clinically prevalent fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and the
absence of atomic-level understanding of CHS. Our long-term goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding
of CHS catalysis, regulation, and inhibition at the atomic level. The current application focuses on structural and
mechanistic studies of the catalysis and inhibition of C. albicans CHSs. C. albicans has four CHSs of which
CaCHS1 and CaCH2 require simultaneous inhibition for fungicidal effects. While existing PNs potently inhibit
CaCHS2, they are much weaker against CaCHS1 and thus exhibit only moderate antifungal activity against C.
albicans. The molecular mechanism behind the difference in PN potency between CaCHS1 and CaCH2 is
currently unknown. For the future development of CHS-targeting anti-candida agents, it is essential to
understand their structural and mechanistic differences for both catalysis and inhibition. As a preliminary study,
we heterologously expressed and purified catalytically active CaCHS1 and CaCHS2, and solved the cryo-EM
structures of CaCHS2 in the apo-, substrate-bound, and PN (nikkomycin Z and polyoxin D)-bound forms. We
also developed novel activity assays for the determination of chitin chain length and quantitation of both long
insoluble chitin and short soluble chito-oligosaccharides, and established a method for chemo-enzymatic
synthesis of nikkomycin analogs. Based on these developments, we propose to study the mechanism of chitin
formation and extrusion by CaCHS2 (Aim 1), the functional and structural basis of the lower susceptibility of
CaCHS1 to PNs as well as the synergy of using both CaCHS1 and CaCHS2 inhibitors (Aim 2), and the detailed
and systematic structure-activity relationships of PNs (Aim 3). For Aims 2 and 3, clinical isolates of C. albicans
and non-albicans candida strains will also be included for inhibitor testing, increasing the translational potential
of our research program. The proposed research is significant because it will provide the molecular basis for
future development of novel antifungals against a clinically unexploited target."
10835050,"Human reproductive success and the development of healthy offspring depend on accurate transmission of
genetic material from parent to child. Homologous recombination during meiosis plays a central role in this
genetic transmission by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Errors in recombination can lead to
aneuploidy or mutations in gametes that in turn cause miscarriage or developmental defects in children.
Understanding the mechanism and regulation of recombination is thus critical for understanding how meiotic
errors affect human fertility and child development, but the molecular principles of recombination remain
incompletely understood because of a paucity of biochemical and structural information. Meiotic recombination
initiates with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by the Spo11 protein in collaboration with a suite of
accessory factors. We recently overcame longstanding barriers to progress by purifying for the first time
recombinant complexes of DSB-promoting proteins. Building on this advance, the Keeney and Patel labs
propose to extend their ongoing collaboration to combine biochemical, structural, and single molecule
biophysical approaches in vitro with functional experiments in vivo to illuminate the molecular principles that
govern how DSB formation by Spo11 occurs. By conducting these studies in parallel on proteins from mouse
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we will dive deeply into the mechanisms of evolutionarily conserved processes
while retaining the ability to explore mammal-specific aspects. Aim 1 will focus on a “core complex” of Spo11
with its direct binding partners TOP6BL (mammals) and Rec102–Rec104–Ski8 (yeast). We will apply cryo-EM,
x-ray crystallography, and computational modeling along with biochemical studies to define the structure of
Spo11 core complexes and their critical protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces. We will also test the
physiological relevance of our structural and biochemical findings in vivo. To this end, we will use molecular
genetic, genomic, and cytological studies in yeast and will employ a novel approach to parallelized genetic
screening in mouse by competitively transplanting pools of genetically modified spermatogonial stem cells into
testes of germ cell-depleted mice. Aim 2 will focus on the conserved accessory proteins Rec114, Mei4, and
Mer2, which are important as a nexus for regulating DSB timing, number and location. We will use NMR
spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and computational modeling to define the structures and protein-
protein interfaces of heterotrimeric Rec114–Mei4 complexes and of homotetrameric Mer2 complexes. We will
use bulk biochemical and single molecule biophysical approaches to define the mechanism and dynamics
behind the cooperative assembly of these proteins to form nucleoprotein condensates on DNA, which we
hypothesize to be a central feature of their ability to support Spo11 activity. We will also apply a battery of in
vivo assays to test functional predictions arising from the structural and biochemical findings."

The Mayo Clinic BIRCWH program has been funded for two cycles since 2010. Over the 9 years of the
BIRCWH program, we have demonstrated progress toward our long term goal of increasing the science
workforce of interdisciplinary teams translating scientific discoveries into clinical practice to improve women’s
health. Evidence of this success is provided by the fifteen scholars trained in the BIRCWH program who
enhanced the interdisciplinary research in women’s health at Mayo Clinic. BIRCWH scholars received 61
grants as Principle Investigators with a return of investment of $2.91 per NIH dollar as Principle Investigators
and $30.2 per NIH dollar as Principle Investigators or Co-Investigators. Our short-term goal in this cycle is to
provide training to investigators who can assume leadership roles in interdisciplinary research teams in
women’s health. In order to achieve these goals, our program plan is structured around three aims that align
with the three pillars of the BIRCWH program: interdisciplinary research, mentoring, and career development.
First, we aim to recruit a diverse group of early-stage investigators with an outstanding potential to lead
interdisciplinary research teams in women’s health. Our second aim is to provide both structured and tailored
educational experiences based on career development needs that include didactic programs and a mentored
research experience in an interdisciplinary environment. And finally, we aim to partner with other BIRCWH
programs, career development programs within Mayo Clinic, and nationally, to enhance training in women’s
health research and foster a community of scholars. A strong community of fellow scholars and established
investigators in women’s health research provides the networking opportunities and supports collaborations
essential for sustaining and developing new interdisciplinary research programs. The rich environment of other
career development programs at Mayo Clinic such as the Mayo Clinic Center for Translational and Clinical
Science (CCaTS) and the Specialized Centers of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences
programs, training in incorporating sex as a biological variable in research, and our collaborations with the
BIRCWH programs at other institutions provide outstanding networking opportunities for our scholars."
10839468,"The dramatic rise in opioid use and misuse over the past decade has resulted in an upsurge of
infants born dependent upon opioids. Many of these babies will experience neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) as their bodies withdraw from high levels of opioids in the
maternal-fetal circulation. While there has been significant improvement in implementing and
standardizing treatment protocols for managing NOWS infants, there remain significant
concerns regarding the long-term impact of prenatal opioid exposure. Moreover it is unclear
whether the severity of NOWS has any relationship with adult outcomes. Animal studies can be
useful in identifying both potential long-term vulnerabilities as well as underlying changes in
neurodevelopment that may confer increased risk. Preclinical data on prenatal oxycodone
exposure are limited which is unfortunate given the widespread use of this particular opioid by
women of reproductive age. We have recently developed an animal model of prenatal opioid
exposure that utilizes self-administration of oxycodone with use beginning prior to conception
and continuing throughout pregnancy. Our initial findings demonstrate dose-dependent changes
in offspring body weight gain and ultrasonic vocalizations that emerge during the early postnatal
period. In addition, we have documented significant changes in the transcriptional regulator
MeCP2 on postnatal day 1 in these offspring. The current set of studies will determine whether
brain region specific effects on MeCP2 persist across development and to what extent these
effects are mediated by maternal intake and/or and postnatal withdrawal signs (Specific Aim 1).
Studies will also determine the relationship between maternal intake, postnatal withdrawal signs
and adult substance abuse liability and impulsive behavior, as these represent two potential
vulnerabilities suggested in clinical findings (Specific Aim 2). Finally, these studies will
determine whether similar outcomes are observed when females abruptly stop use during
pregnancy (forced abstinence) or are transitioned from oxycodone to either methadone or
buprenorphine, two common medications used in opioid replacement therapy (Specific Aim 3).
Overall, these studies will determine the relationship between voluntary maternal intake of
oxycodone, neonatal signs of withdrawal and long-term outcomes and test the hypothesis that
these effects are due to epigenetic events induced by changes in MeCP2 expression."

10837271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mitochondria have retained a small circular genome (mtDNA) that encodes essential components of the elec-
tron transport chain. Mutations in the mtDNA can cause devastating maternally inherited diseases, while the
accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations is linked to common pathologies. Although mtDNA mutations impact
human health, the process(es) that influence their occurrence and level with the cell (i.e., heteroplasmy) remain
under considerable debate, despite nearly 30 years of study. Using cutting edge sequencing methods, we have
made key contributions to understanding the drivers of mtDNA mutagenesis in a variety of diseases and animal
models. This includes the discovery that the types and frequencies of mutations varies considerably between
organisms and tissues, evidence that deaminations arising from a single-stranded replication interemediate is
the driver of mutations in most vertebrates, and strong evidence that selection of mtDNA is occurring in somatic
tissues.
 Here, we aim to understand the cellular mechanisms that regulate mtDNA heteroplasmy and its intersection
with mitochondrial quality control pathways. Testing hypotheses related to heteroplasmy and mtDNA selection
has been difficult due to the reliance on bulk sequencing approaches. However, the advent of new methods, such
as single-cell and ultra-high accuracy sequencing, has opened up the possibility of answering these questions.
We will use a combination of these two technologies to directly assess how mitochondrial quality control mecha-
nistically influences the occurrence and accumulation of mtDNA mutations. Specifically, we will pursue three main
focus areas: 1) Using a modified form of scATAC-Seq adapted to quantify mtDNA mutations/heteroplasmy, we will
perform experiments that will test hypotheses related to if/how mitochondrial quality control (mQC) mechanisms
regulate mtDNA heteroplasmy in cells and thereby keeping deleterious mutations from exceeding a phenotypic
threshold by small molecule interventions and manipulations genes known to be involved in quality control; 2)
We have identified mutationally intolerant sites in mouse mtDNA. We will determine the specific molecular cause
behind the presence of these apparent “immutable” sites by using cutting-edge base editing methods and then
performing biochemical and in vitro assays to determine the impact of the induced mutation on mitophagy, mtDNA
replication, oxidative phosphorylation, and other mitochondrial functions; 3) Develop single-cell ultra-high accu-
racy long read sequencing that will allow for the simultaneous accounting of single-nucleotide variants, structural
variants, and heteroplasmy. Such technology is needed in order to fully understand the biology of mtDNA mu-
tations in disease. The long-term objective of our work is to define the cellular mechanisms that influence the
occurrence of mtDNA mutations in the germline and somatic tissues. This work will contribute to an understanding
of the molecular mechanisms that influence heteroplasmy which, in turn, could ultimately lead to the development
of much needed treatments for diseases caused by mtDNA mutations."

Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica; DM) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease that causes
progressive muscle weakness, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep disturbance. No effective treatments are
available to slow or reverse symptoms. DM type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the DM
protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Clinical features result from pathogenic effects of the DMPK mRNA that lead to
deregulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing of at least several dozen transcripts. In pre-clinical studies,
alternative splicing outcomes in muscle tissue have been used as sensitive pharmacodynamic indicators of
therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug response. Many patients with DM1 also experience central
sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished working memory, impaired visuospatial skills, and
deficits in problem-solving skills. These central nervous system (CNS) symptoms are associated with mis-
regulated alternative splicing patterns and gene expression changes in post-mortem brain. Cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) surrounds and protects the brain and CNS from injury. Changes in the composition of CSF can serve
as early indicators of changes in the molecular pathology of the CNS in living individuals. However, methods
for the use of CSF to measure DM1-specific splicing patterns or gene expression changes in the CNS are
unavailable. Extracellular RNA (exRNA) refers to mRNAs and noncoding RNAs that are released from and
taken up by cells as a novel form of cell-to-cell communication. Our recent work suggests that splicing
outcomes in urine exRNA have the capacity to serve as robust biomarkers of peripheral disease activity in
DM1. In this prospective study, we will test the hypothesis that exRNA contains a representative transcriptome
that is altered in DM1 and quantifiable in CSF. Splicing outcomes in CSF exRNA are expected to correlate
with DM1 disease activity using clinical measures of CNS function. Aim 1 will identify and characterize the
CSF exRNA profile in DM1 patients and unaffected control subjects. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a state-of-
the-art technology, will be used to quantify a panel of CSF exRNA splice events previously reported as altered
in DM1 CNS. To identify new potential biomarkers, we will perform exRNA sequencing. Aim 2 will determine
the test/re-test reliability of the exRNA profile by longitudinal monitoring in a prospective cohort of DM1
patients. Aim 3 will establish a relationship between the exRNA profile and quantitative clinical measures of
CNS disease activity, including cognitive testing and brain MRI. Proposed context of use (COU): monitoring
biomarker for the serial assessment of disease status and burden in DM1 patients. In future clinical trials, CSF
exRNA biomarkers would enable patient stratification and convenient monitoring of molecular disease activity
in the CNS during the course of drug treatment. The approach used in this proposal also will be applicable to
DM type 2 (DM2) and to other neurodegenerative diseases more generally."

The NJ/NY Hazardous Materials Worker Training Center has a long history of effective training that meets the requirements
of OSHA 29CFR1910.120, providing hazardous materials knowledge and skills to over 450,000 workers since 1987. Our
Center has effectively trained unemployed and underemployed individuals in job skills and environmental clean-up procedures.
The courses develop competency in workers to critically analyze dangerous situations, and enable them to identify safe work
practices. Key principles of adult education are incorporated into our training, and training courses are developed to include
peer-learning, hands-on activities, and development critical thinking skills. The Center has a robust evaluation plan, and will
continue to expand the types of data collected on the impact of training on workplace practice, as well as how training can
more effectively influence workplace safety culture. Our Center has effectively been able to place our program graduates in
sustainable jobs. Our Center proposes to expand to include Make the Road New York to reach additional target populations.
The ECWTP will utilize focused strategies to recruit, train and employ underserved residents living in disadvantaged
communities for construction and environmental remediation work. The Center has long-term, effective partnerships in
minority and underserved communities that help reinforce occupational health and worker education, and mitigate health

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GB) or grade IV glioma, is one of the most lethal human malignancies
and the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with a current median survival of only
14 months. Despite aggressive standard-of-care treatments including surgical resection, radiation, and
chemotherapy, local recurrence of GB is essentially universal, and recurrent tumors are highly resistant
to conventional cytotoxic treatments. New treatment strategies based on an improved understanding
of recurrence mechanisms are desperately needed to improve overall survival for these patients. It has
been highly suggested that treatment-resistant glioma cells, particularly glioma stem cells (GSCs), i.e.,
tumor-initiating cells or tumor-propagating cells, contribute to GB recurrence via translocation from
parenchymal GSC niches. We propose an intriguing new mechanism whereby glioma cells in
circulation can similarly contribute to tumor development/regrowth. Utilizing human specimen and
orthotopic, genetic mouse tumor models our preliminary data demonstrate that these circulating glioma
cells (CGCs) acquire a cancer stem cell-like phenotype: activated in stemness, resistant to genotoxic
treatments, and more importantly, capable of homing to a primary tumor site to repopulate locally and
contribute to new tumor formation. This suggests a previously unidentified role of CGCs in tumor
micrometastases and local relapse in GB and possibly other solid tumors. We are uniquely positioned
(as the first group to report on the identification of circulating glioma cells - CGCs) to extend our
investigations to: i) decipher the key molecular features underlying CGC development and the potential
contribution of CGCs to tumor bed recurrences, ii) discover novel therapeutic interventions against
CGCs to overcome the universal local recurrence patterns seen in GB. Our proposal seeks to
accomplish these translationally-relevant objectives through an innovative set of complementary
strategies. Based on our preliminary results and expertise of the assembled team, we propose to test
the hypothesis that CGCs recapitulate the features of CSCs, contribute to primary tumor reseeding and
that molecular targeting of CGCs provide a novel strategy to overcome GB therapy resistance. To test
this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: AIM 1. Define the potential stem cell features
and transcriptional landscape of CGC by performing single cell RNA-seq. AIM 2. Determine the WNT-
dependent mechanisms for CGC-mediated GB tumorigenesis. AIM 3. Test the therapeutic efficacy of
WNT inhibition in GB tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. By accomplishing these aims via our
combined interdisciplinary expertise, infrastructure, and discovery of a novel GB recurrence paradigm,
we seek to build the foundation for an improved therapeutic approach for GB."

Migraine is a common, painful and highly disabling disorder. Depressive symptoms are common in people with migraine and are associated with increased suffering. Despite the significant emotional, social, and economic burden of this comorbidity, no existing treatment adequately addresses both migraine disability and elevated depressive symptoms. Development of scalable and integrative treatments that address both migraine disability and comorbid depressive symptoms has been identified as a major gap in migraine treatment. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based and standardized treatment that is an excellent candidate for reducing disability and depressive symptoms in people with migraine. Our preliminary data show that MBCT reduced migraine-related disability; however, during exit interviews, participants noted the burden of attending 8 weekly in-person sessions was a substantial barrier to accessing care. Our preliminary data suggest an abbreviated and telephone-delivered MBCT (MBCT-T) protocol is a feasible alternative to in-person treatment. However, video- based delivery (MBCT-V) may improve patient engagement. This project aims to prepare for a definitive multi-site Phase III trial of remote-delivered MBCT-T or MBCT-V or both in patients with migraine and depressive symptoms. During Study 1, we will use guidelines from the NIH’s Behavioral Change Consortium to optimize fidelity MBCT-T and MBCT-V for patients with migraine (as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders – 3) and depressive symptoms (as defined by empirical cut-offs on the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9). Products developed during Aim 1 will be: training protocols, facilitator treatment manuals, fidelity checklists, MBCT-T/V Adherence and Competence Scales, fidelity coding manuals. Products will be iteratively optimized using quantitative and qualitative fidelity metrics assessed at the patient-level (comprehension) and facilitator-level (corrective feedback, intervention delivery) following the delivery of one MBCT-T and one MBCT-V group led by a certified MBCT facilitator at a site in New York, NY. Also, during Study 1, a 22-hour training will be conducted for facilitators across two additional sites in the Bronx, NY and Winston-Salem, NC. During Study 2, we will conduct a multi-site pilot RCT (n=144) of MBCT-T, MBCT-V, and Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). We will evaluate fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability of each arm across three sites in patients with migraine and depressive symptoms. Pre- specified decision rules for fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility will determine the arms of the future phase III trial evaluating remote-delivered MBCT for migraine disability and depressive symptoms."

Ninety percent of pregnant U.S. women have simultaneously over 50 different chemicals in their bodies. With
over 70,000 chemicals registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and with many of which not
yet evaluated for reproductive toxicity, understanding the effects of chemical exposure on placental function is
much warranted. This is significant as many of these chemicals have the potential to alter placental function and
the health of the placenta is critical to a healthy pregnancy as well as fetal and maternal well-being. However,
studying the effects of chemical exposure on human placental function in vivo is filled with challenges, including
ethical concerns, inadequacy of animal models to recapitulate human trophoblast cell invasion, and difficulty of
working with limited primary cells that cannot be passaged many times. To advance the field of placental
toxicology, suitable in vitro human models capable of mimicking in vivo conditions and enabling dynamic drug
delivery in higher-throughput screening formats are urgently needed. Key limitations of available models include
low throughput and chemical hepatic biotransformation that occurs in vivo. In this proposal, we plan to develop
a high throughput system to test placental cell invasion using a 3D placental microtissue coupled with hepatic
liver biotransformation. This first-of-its-kind hepatic-placenta organ-tandem on a chip will simulate the liver
metabolism that chemicals undergo in vivo prior to reaching the placental bed. This state-of-the-art in vitro
platform will be the first step towards incorporating organism-level organization into reproductive risk assessment
using a non-animal-based approach. We anticipate that this new platform will be a key tool to be incorporated in
the development of adverse outcome pathways for future placental risk assessment."

UTIs occur in 8% of pregnant women, affecting ~500,000 women annually in the U.S. Serious maternal and
infant consequences include pyelonephritis, sepsis, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Guidelines
recommend screening and empirical treatment of UTIs (including asymptomatic bacteriuria) in early
pregnancy. This approach has become standard of care, yet there is a lack of rigorous evidence to inform
antibiotic selection or duration in pregnant women. Most evidence about the benefits and harms of antibiotic
regimens has been generated by randomized clinical trials that excluded pregnant women, and which are
further limited by small sample size, short follow-up, and heterogeneous treatments. Despite clear guidelines
for non-pregnant women, treatment standards for pregnant women are vague. The American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends nitrofurantoins and sulfonamides as first-line during the
second and third trimesters, but provides no guidance for first trimester management. Uncertainty remains
about the teratogenicity of nitrofurantoins and sulfonamides due to limitations of previous observational
studies. In addition, ACOG does not define appropriate antibiotic duration, instead recommending the “shortest
effective duration.” Overall, the lack of guidance about antibiotic selection and treatment duration leads to
substantial practice variation and the potential for harm. For example, clinicians commonly prescribe broad-
spectrum agents despite antimicrobial stewardship initiatives that recommend narrow-spectrum agents.
Providing optimal antibiotic agents and durations could prevent avoidable adverse events, microbiome
disruption, and antibiotic-resistant infections. A comprehensive evaluation using real-world data is needed to
quantify the benefits and risks of commonly used antibiotic regimens to treat pregnant women with UTI. We will
conduct a non-experimental study to examine the utilization, effectiveness, and safety of several commonly
used antibiotic regimens in a real-world setting of diverse pregnant women in the U.S. We will apply modern
epidemiological study design and analytic approaches to study almost two million pregnant antibiotic recipients
and a subset of their infants, from two national databases as well as EHR data from three regional healthcare
systems. Our utilization analysis will use microbiology results to characterize variability in antibiotic prescribing
within the context of local uropathogen susceptibility patterns. Our antibiotic effectiveness analyses will provide
insight into whether the risks of antibiotic treatment failure outcomes vary by antibiotic regimen. Our safety
analyses will compare the risk of birth defects and other perinatal complications by antibiotic regimen.
Exploratory analyses will examine additional adverse drug events (e.g., Clostridioides difficile diarrhea). This
large study will generate evidence to address critical gaps in knowledge about optimal treatment of UTIs in
pregnant women. Our results will inform clinical decision-making and reduce suboptimal antibiotic prescribing,
which will ultimately prevent adverse events, improve perinatal outcomes, and minimize antibiotic resistance."

Heightened performance monitoring and overcontrol (HPM/OC) is a transdiagnostic phenotype comprised of
perfectionism, extreme concern for errors, cognitive inflexibility and excessive need for control. There is
increasing evidence that the HPM/OC phenotype is identifiable in early childhood and underlies obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and anorexia nervosa (AN). These psychiatric
disorders are severe, chronic, and treatment-resistant disorders with high rates of comorbidity. However, there
is surprisingly little research examining the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that make up the
HPM/OC phenotype in early school-age childhood in relation to the development of transdiagnostic psychiatric
symptoms. Moreover, it is unknown how the HPM/OC phenotype interacts with rapid developmental
progression during this age or is influenced by social-contextual features, such as social evaluation, peer
rejection or parenting styles. Determining answers to these fundamental questions could provide insight into
the emergence of the HPM/OC phenotype and provide novel treatment targets for early intervention. The goal
of the current proposal is to improve understanding of the HPM/OC phenotype in early childhood in relation to
early markers of OCD and SAD by assessing the developmental progression of cognitive facets of
performance monitoring and reactive versus proactive cognitive control and the influence of social-contextual
features on psychiatric outcomes. We posit that cognitive processes that make up the HPM/OC phenotype,
including heightened performance monitoring and more reactive versus proactive cognitive control, interact
with various social contexts to differentiate early school-age children with impairing HPM/OC. The early school-
age period is when HPM/OC is first evident and is a time of rapid cognitive and social development, making it a
pivotal time to understand the developmental psychopathology of this presentation. We will employ cutting-
edge and cost-effective electroencephalogram (EEG) event-related potential (ERP) and time-frequency (TF)
analyses to examine multiple Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs across three repeated yearly
assessments in a sample of 300 community children oversampled for elevated dimensional HPM/OC, ages
spanning 4 - 9 years. This fine-grained evaluation will provide an opportunity to characterize 1) how HPM/OC
impacts normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of RDoC constructs during an age of high neural plasticity,
2) the developmental progression of cognitive facets of the HPM/OC phenotype in relation to transdiagnostic
psychiatric impairment and 3) the impact of social-contextual features that may influence these relationships.
This knowledge could have far-reaching effects on our understanding of the early neurodevelopment of the
HPM/OC phenotype prior to disorder onset, which could inform early identification of high-risk children and
targeted early interventions that could lessen the severity, course and impairment of multiple psychiatric
disorders across the lifespan."

 A majority of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) have behavioral health conditions. Racial
and ethnic minority CSHCN are more likely to have these health conditions and less likely to have them
diagnosed and treated compared with other CSHCN. Disparities in access to care contribute to disparities in
use of behavioral health treatment, and inadequate insurance leads to poor health outcomes among CSHCN.
Early identification and treatment for behavioral health conditions is critical to support the health and well-being
of CSHCN over their lifetimes. Yet, many racial and ethnic minority families of CSHCN experience challenges
in accessing needed behavioral health services. Disparities in behavioral health outcomes can be mitigated by
expanding insurance coverage and encouraging use of treatment. Addressing these mechanisms early in life is
critical to mitigate health disparities over the entire life course.
 There is mixed evidence on the extent to which general insurance expansions reduce disparities, and
some studies even find that racial and ethnic disparities in coverage and health service use increased after
recent health insurance expansions. Other policies, including streamlined or automatic enrollment in Medicaid,
have been shown to increase Medicaid enrollment, retention and overall insurance coverage rates, but there is
no evidence about the impact of these policies on disparities in coverage or utilization for racial/ethnic minority
CSHCN, or CSHCN who have mental health conditions. Targeted interventions in expanding services may be
more effective at reducing disparities for these populations but evidence on the effects of targeted interventions
is limited. More research is needed to understand the extent to which targeted policies can reduce disparities
in health insurance coverage and behavioral health care utilization among racial/ethnic minority CSHCN.
 This study will examine the effects of a targeted intervention to increase insurance coverage and
behavioral health service utilization among racial and ethnic minority CSHCN: automatic enrollment in
Medicaid via Supplemental Security Income (SSI). We propose two complementary analytic approaches, one
with nationally representative survey data and one exploiting a natural experiment in Medicaid claims data. We
will quantify the effects of Medicaid automatic enrollment via SSI on disparities in insurance coverage and
behavioral health service use among racial and ethnic minority CHSCN; identify the demographics of CSHCN
who are newly enrolled in Medicaid due to automatic enrollment policies and examine potential disparities in
their health needs; and examine how the effects on behavioral health service use, health outcomes, and
disparities in service use and outcomes evolve over time for newly enrolled CSHCN. Our findings will provide
critical insights about how targeted Medicaid automatic enrollment could improve behavioral health outcomes
for this underserved population and will contribute to broader understanding of how reducing administrative
burden may improve health equity for disadvantaged and underserved CSHCN."

As a sleep-medicine physician, I seek to understand how sleep health affects the progression and long-term
consequences of chronic disease and, ultimately, implement sleep-based interventions to improve the health of
patients. Sleep disorders are highly prevalent among people with HIV (PWH), and emerging evidence suggests
that sleep disorders may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in PWH. Sleep disorders, such as
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insufficient sleep duration, are recognized as indepdent risk factors for
cardiovascular risk. However, little is known about how sleep disorders worsen chronic inflammation among
PWH. One understudied pathway by sleep disorders may increase inflammation and cardiovascular risk is by
promoting monocyte activation. PWH experience chronic monocyte dysregulation despite antiretroviral therapy,
and those with a greater burden of monocyte activation are at an higher risk of developing cardiovascular
disease. Monocytes from individuals exposed to OSA or insufficient sleep exhibit markers of monocyte activation,
such as greater production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of cellular adhesion markers. Various
stimuli have been found to contribute to excessive monocyte activation, but the impact of sleep disorders on
monocyte activation in PWH has not been investigated. I hypothesize that PWH are vulnerable to amplified
monocyte activation from exposure to the “second hit” of a sleep disorder. In Aims 1 and 2, I will utilize stored
samples to evaluate monocyte activation in PWH by chronic and acute sleep exposure, respectively. Aims 1a
and 1b will investigate if OSA and insufficient sleep are a) associated with a monocyte activation phenotype in
PWH and b) explore if there is a differential effect of sleep disorder exposure on monocyte activation profiles by
HIV status. In Aim 2, I will quantify the impact of acute sleep deprivation on monocyte activation among PWH
who participated in an acute sleep deprivation protocol. In Aim 3, I will prospectively enroll PWH with OSA and
evaluate the impact of OSA treatment on reducing monocyte activation among PWH. Lastly, in Aims 4a and 4b,
I will utilize stored and prospectively enrolled samples utilized in Aims 2 and 3 to investigate differences in gene
expression in circulating monocytes a) before and after acute sleep deprivation and b) before and after treatment
of OSA, respectively. If successful, this proposal will identify a biological mechanism by which sleep disorders
contribute to HIV-associated inflammation, identifying a targetable pathey to reduce CVD risk in PWH by either
sleep-based or pharmacologic interventions. Through completing the proposed experiments alongside formal
didactic education and intensive mentorship, I will develop my expertise in HIV-associated inflammation and
immunophenotyping, develop new skills in systems immunology, and gain experience in conducting human
subjects sleep research. This proposal takes advantage of the robust resources and research environment at
the University of Pittsburgh, which includes my excellent mentorship team to support my development as an
independent-physician scientist."
10838165,"Fungal infections are an increasing human health risk, and the development of fungal resistance to the
limited repertoire of available drugs is exacerbating this threat. Five species within the genus Candida
predominantly cause disease manifestations in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
Indeed, candidiasis is the most common opportunistic oral infection affecting people with AIDS. Earlier work by
our group and others demonstrated changes in oral fungal composition and mutational changes in
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes throughout the course of HIV infection and treatment, suggesting a
uniqueness to the oral environment. Although there are several known molecular mechanisms that confer
antifungal resistance, recent studies suggest the high likelihood that there are many novel mechanisms yet to
be identified. Our goals are to employ evolutionary genomic approaches to gain both basic and applied insights
on the oral environment that will inform diagnostics and ultimately treatment. Our central hypothesis is that
fungi will evolve over time in the oral environment, and this R03 is designed to demonstrate both support for
this hypothesis and feasibility of the novel methods we are developing. Our proposed work leverages an earlier
case-control study (“Crosstalk”) by one of our team members and includes a set of 50 HIV-positive and HAART
naïve individuals, and 76 HIV-negative controls, over a 5-year study period. Deidentified and cryopreserved
saliva, caries swabs, fungal cultures, and bacterial cultures from these patients are immediately available,
along with associated clinical and demographic data.
 In Aim 1 we will use direct long-read sequencing on patient saliva and caries swabs to determine the
fungal mycobiome at unprecedented resolution. This profiling will come from direct sequence analysis of the
full-length Candida rRNA operon from patient samples.
 In Aim 2 we will determine the fungal resistome of the same samples over the course of treatment. We
will perform longitudinal profiling by hybridization-capture with biotinylated probes to target known fungal AMR
and biofilm-associated genes. These genes will then be analyzed for SNPs over time and for signatures of
positive selection pressure.
 We will next propose an R01 with a goal of identifying new fungal genetic AMR determinants using
pan-genomic and molecular adaptation analyses on fungal cultures from Crosstalk and more recent isolates.
This takes advantage of the recent discovery that fungi, like bacteria, have a core and an accessory genome;
we plan to correlate the genes from the accessory genome, and SNPs across the genome, with AMR
phenotype data, concentrating on Candida species common to the HIV oral environment. We expect that this
project will identify putative novel Candida antifungal resistance mechanisms and provide much needed
information on Candida evolution in the oral environment."

Generalized epilepsy treatments focus on seizure suppression, rather than halting the underlying pathogenesis that is
initiated by seizure-associated changes in brain plasticity. Mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis are difficult to
identify in humans due to genetic and environmental diversity, and as such, preclinical models provide advantages for
elucidating epileptogenic processes. Our Fos activation pathway and lesion analyses suggest that the ventromedial nucleus
of the hypothalamus (VMH) is a critical anatomical node for the propagation of seizure discharge from the forebrain
seizure network to the brainstem seizure network. Our preliminary data further support this hypothesis as loss of
glutamate transport into presynaptic vesicles by deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter gene, Vglut2, solely in the
VMH can block seizure propagation into the brainstem seizure network, which contains cardio-respiratory centers. Access
of seizure discharge into the brainstem results in both brainstem-tonic seizures and increases the probability of Sudden
Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). These data suggest the hypothesis that the VMH is a critical anatomical node
for seizure-induced plasticity. It also indicates a VMH neuroanatomical pathway, which may be important in SUDEP,
since preventing seizure discharge from propagating into brainstem cardio-respiratory centers could prevent SUDEP. Our
long-term goal is to identify neuroanatomical substrates and signaling pathways critical for epileptogenesis, so that
therapeutic treatments and preventative strategies can be developed for epilepsy and SUDEP in humans. The overall
objectives of this proposal build upon our previous work and preliminary data leading to the following aims/objectives: 1)
Elucidate the mechanisms by which the VMH is involved in the epileptogenic process for allowing ictal discharge
propagation from the forebrain seizure network into the brainstem seizure network and 2) Determine the genomic
landscape in the VMH using spatial transcriptomics before and during epileptogenesis. In Aim 1, we will assess VMH
reorganizational process using 1) mice with VMH-targeted deletion of genes (i.e., Vglut2, trkB, Bdnf) in our repeated
flurothyl model to assess seizure outcomes and 2) assess changes in afferent and efferent connectivity to the VMH via
Timm’s staining (fiber sprouting) and tract tracing. For Aim 2, we will utilize the novel approach of spatial
transcriptomics to perform cell-type and regional whole transcriptome analysis using a NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial
Profiler and Illumina sequencing to determine gene expression changes in different populations of VMH neurons.
Expression differences will be confirmed by qRT-PCR and/or immunolabeling. Overall, our proposal will elucidate
seizure response mechanisms that initiate and contribute to epileptogenesis and provide a framework of transcriptional
networks contributing to epileptogenesis that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention for epilepsy and/or SUDEP."
10860935,"The rearranged during transfection (RET) gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). RET aberrations
are found in various types of human cancer. Highly potent and selective RET protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) are in the later stage of clinical development for precision cancer treatment. A lesson learned from the
previous experience is that the PTK-targeted cancer therapy often fails because of adaptive resistance evolved
from the drug-tolerant, residual tumors. Results of our preliminary studies indicate that the RET-targeted cancer
treatment is no exception to this rule. To prolong the suppression of tumors and the lives of patients, we must
eliminate the residual tumor cells, identify target mutations that cause drug resistance, find or develop drugs
effective against different drug-resistant mutants, and discover alternative signaling mechanisms that promote
tumor progression. The overall goal of this project is to improve the targeted therapy for RET aberration-
associated cancer. The objectives of this project are to map the landscape of drug-resistant RET kinase
mutations, identify drugs effective against mutant RET, determine the structures of RET kinase variants,
characterize the structural bases of interaction between RET and its inhibitors, and evaluate a method to
minimize the residual lung tumors. Specific Aim 1 is to identify and characterize RET mutations resistant to
selective RET TKIs in preclinical models and cancer patients, and find potential secondary drugs. Specific Aim
2 is to determine the crystal structures of drug-resistant RET mutant proteins and RET-inhibitor complexes.
Specific Aim 3 is to test RET mutant-sensitive TKIs in vivo and evaluate a method for reducing the residual
fibrotic stroma and the associated residual tumor cells. Taken together, this study will provide a RET mutation-
TKI toolkit for precision management of RET-aberrant cancers to maximize the benefit of RET-targeted cancer
therapy, lay the foundation for developing a continuous pipeline of mutant-effective RET TKIs, and find a method
to reduce the residual drug-tolerant tumors to delay tumor recurrence. The outcomes of this project will have
positive translational impact on prolonging the survival of patients with cancer."
10849699,"ABSTRACT: In the classical mammalian cell cycle model, CDK and cyclin complexes are responsible for
driving specific events in a sequential fashion. Mitogenic or oncogenic signals drive the activation of CDK4/6
complexes that initiate cell cycle progression. These complexes promote RB phosphorylation that leads to the
expression of a highly conserved cadre of genes that are required for progression through the remainder of the
cell cycle. The concept put forward by this model is that cell cycle control is linear and highly predictable.
However, recent findings related to the inter-dependencies of CDK/cyclins illustrate the need for better
understanding the cell cycle repertoires that are operable in tumors. In preliminary data using unbiased and
targeted approaches we have interrogated the extent to which the “utopian” simple version of the cell cycle
breaks-down. This work indicates that in cancer models there are multiple different cell cycle modes, which
have significance for tumorigenic proliferation and therapeutic interventions. Here we will take an integrated
approach to fundamentally understand “dystopian” cell cycle states (Aim 1) and define mechanisms of collateral
therapeutic resistance and new vulnerabilities (Aim 2) which associate with non-canonical cell cycle states."

 Exposure to social stressors is an important risk factor for the development of mental illnesses such as
anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress-related mental illnesses are more common in
women than men, and these differences arise during adolescence. Androgens work to change brain structure
and function during adolescence, how this transformation impacts behavior is poorly understood. We will test
the hypothesis that the activation of androgen receptors during puberty permanently programs neural circuits
of social behavior to be less sensitive to social stress. Our studies will be conducted using California mice
(Peromyscus californicus), an ideal model system for studying adolescent development. In this species
adolescence lasts almost twice as long as conventional mice and rats, which will allow us to apply advanced
neuroscience and molecular methods in way that would be difficult or impossible in standard model systems.
 In adult California mice, females but not males exposed to social defeat stress orient towards an unfamiliar
target mouse while simultaneously avoiding it, a behavior we define as social vigilance. However, in juvenile
California mice, social stress increases social vigilance in both males and females. In males, prepubertal
castration results in female-typical social vigilance responses in adulthood, while pubertal treatment with the
non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone reduces sensitivity to social stress in both males and females.
We will test the hypothesis that activation of the androgen receptor (AR) during puberty permanently
programs neural circuits of social behavior to be less sensitive to social stress.
 First, we will use CRISPR-based gene editing to knock-down AR expression in ventral hippocampus
(vHPC) neurons projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or nucleus accumbens (NAc). The
prolonged development of this species will allow us to knock-down AR expression before the onset of
adolescent development. Second, we will use state-of-the-art sequencing methods to identify AR genomic
binding sites in the vHPC and assess maturation of hippocampal cells with single-cell resolution. Finally, we
will determine how circuit-specific AR knock-down alters membrane excitability of vHPC neurons using whole-
cell slice electrophysiology. These analyses bridge the gap between the molecular and behavioral data in the
other aims. Our team is ideally suited to execute these studies. Dr. Trainor is a leader in developing the
California mouse stress model and open access tools. Dr. Tollkuhn is a leader in the application of modern
sequencing methods to identify the molecular mechanisms of sexual differentiation of the brain. Dr. Robison is
a leading expert in the use of electrophysiological approaches to study the impact of stress on neural circuits.
The proposed studies will be the first to identify androgen-dependent molecular pathways activated during
adolescent development in neural circuits that drive translationally relevant behavioral responses to stress."

This project is focused on understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control energy conversion within
the cell power plant, the mitochondrion. Transport of ion and metabolites across the inner mitochondrial
membrane is the foundation of mitochondrial physiology. Here we study the molecular mechanisms involved in
passive uptake of H+ (“mitochondrial H+ leak”) and Ca2+ (“mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake”) into mitochondria down
the negative voltage () across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial H+ leak is responsible
for the conversion of chemical energy of mitochondrial substrates into heat. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake lets
Ca2+ enter mitochondria during cytosolic Ca2+ transients to stimulate Ca2+-dependent enzymes of the Krebs
cycle and mitochondrial energy conversion. The mitochondrial H+ leak and Ca2+ uptake are mediated by
specialized integral proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane called uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and
mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) correspondingly. The molecular and functional characterization of UCPs
and MCU has been difficult due to the inability to measure H+ and Ca2+ currents across the inner mitochondrial
membrane directly. We have resolved this major technical barrier and developed a method for direct patch-
clamp recording of UCP and MCU currents across the whole inner mitochondrial membrane. Using this
method, we propose to address the structure-function relations within UCPs and MCU to understand the
molecular mechanisms that govern H+ and Ca2+ translocation via these membrane transport proteins. For
UCPs, we plan to identify the mechanisms by which free fatty acids, the endogenous UCPs activators, cause
H+ translocation via UCPs. We also propose to develop a new generation of drugs that can activate H+ leak
via UCP and be used for the treatment of type II diabetes, obesity, and fatty liver. For MCU, we propose to
reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for the exceptionally high Ca2+ selectivity of MCU, the MCU
inward rectification (one-way permeation of Ca2+ into mitochondria), and the MCU potentiation by cytosolic
Ca2+. This research will resolve several long-standing problems in the field of bioenergetics and will eventually
enable pharmacological control of key mitochondrial functions in therapeutic and research purposes."

Injectable therapies for blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have provided impressive initial
benefits to most patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), though some have a
suboptimal response. Other vasoactive proteins in addition to VEGF may contribute to the progression of
nAMD. An alternative strategy would be to target hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a master regulator
of these other vasoactive proteins. We have demonstrated that intraocular delivery of HIF-1 inhibitors is
effective in preventing retinal neovascularization (RNV) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a variety of
mouse models, where achieving therapeutically relevant drug levels without reaching toxic concentrations is
both achievable and key in developing an effective treatment strategy. Another drawback of anti-VEGF
therapies has been the disappointing long-term outcomes, as the injections do not eliminate CNV but rather
temporarily stop vessel growth and leakage. Further, the short duration of action requires that injections be
repeated every 1-2 months. When injections are missed, vessels continue to grow and leak, resulting in
permanent retinal damage. One solution is to develop a non-invasive treatment that can be self-administered
by patients so that treatment can continue even when patients are unable to return to their retina specialist.
However, thus far, it has not been possible to deliver adequate amounts of drug to the retina in large animals
(like humans) by topical eye drops. We have discovered an approach for effectively delivering drugs to the
posterior segment in large animals, including rabbits and pigs, with once daily topical eye drops. Our unique
eye drop-based drug delivery technology provides improved intraocular delivery of both water soluble and
water insoluble drugs, including acriflavine. We hypothesize that a new hypotonic gelling eye drop formulation
designed to maximize the residence time, intraocular penetration, and drug delivery to the posterior segment
with minimal toxicity will be an important step toward the development of a new eye drop-based treatment for
nAMD and other ocular diseases with neovascular sequelae. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop and fully
characterize new polymer blends for optimal viscosity, shear thinning, gelation rate, and intraocular penetration
of acriflavine. In Specific Aim 2, we will test gelling formulations optimized for various key properties versus
standard liquid eye drops for maximum tolerated dose and efficacy in preventing CNV in a rat model. In
Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate ocular pharmacokinetics and efficacy in rabbits, which are considered a
relevant animal model to humans, particularly for characterizing delivery to the posterior segment with topical
formulations. We will further evaluate ocular biocompatibility in rabbits, the most commonly used animal model
to assess safety of ocular products due to the similarities in eye structure and the sensitivity of the eye to
potential toxicity. If these preclinical studies progress as expected, we will be well-positioned for translation of a
first-of-its-kind eye drop to the clinic."

 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common complication in extremely preterm infants,
is characterized by impaired lung development. Decreasing oxidant stress which plays a significant role
in BPD pathogenesis remains a critical unmet need. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a known mediator of
pathological oxidant stress, disrupts alveolar epithelial function and promotes lung fibrosis. Dysfunctional
mitochondria generate more oxidants, exhibit impaired mitophagy, and trigger the release of pro-
inflammatory mitochondrial DNA-damage associated molecular patterns (mtDNA-DAMPs) and lung
injury. Furthermore, mtDNA haplogroups, which are inherited polymorphisms that vary with ethnicity,
have been implicated in various lung pathologies. Our group has observed that perinatal mesenchymal
stem cells (MSC) and human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) mitochondrial dysfunction
predicts BPD risk and that decreased MSC mitophagy correlates with increased BPD severity. We have
also found that intranasal thyroid hormone-induced mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with
decreased hyperoxic lung injury and that mtDNA haplogroups mediate differences in hyperoxia-induced
mtDNA damage, inflammatory lung injury, and arrested lung development in newborn mice. In this
""MtDNA Haplogroups in BPD"" project, we will build on these findings and test the central hypotheses that
mtDNA haplogroup variation-mediated differences in postnatal mitochondrial function, mtDNA-DAMPs
and mitophagy modulate BPD risk in infants, and that TH-mediated pulmonary mitochondrial biogenesis
can mitigate such differences to decrease neonatal hyperoxic lung injury through these specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1 Hypothesis: mtDNA haplogroups modulate BPD risk through differences in
platelet bioenergetics, apoptosis, and plasma mtDNA-DAMPs in infants. Approach Determine infant
mtDNA haplogroups, platelet bioenergetics, apoptosis, plasma mtDNA-DAMPs and lung injury severity
(Jensen BPD status).
 Specific Aim 2 will test the Hypothesis that mtDNA haplogroups modulate BPD risk through
differences in oxidant stress, mtDNA damage and mitophagy in infants. Approach Determine
HUVEC, MSC and platelet oxidant generation, plasma oxidant stress, mtDNA damage, and mitophagy
and lung injury severity.
 Specific Aim 3 will test the Hypothesis that thyroid hormone signaling effects mitigate mtDNA
haplogroup-mediated differences in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury in mice. Approach: Expose
wildtype and MNX mice to normoxia/hyperoxia and saline/TH and measure lung damage, inflammation,
oxidant stress and single-cell genomic transcriptional/methylation differences."
10858586,"B lymphocytes are critical players in the development of protective immunity, as well as in pathological states
such as autoimmunity. Careful regulation of the strength and quality of biochemical signals that originate from
their antigen receptors (BCR) is essential to prevent the unwanted activation of potentially harmful autoreactive
B cells, and to generate optimally protective antibody responses. Inhibitory signaling mechanisms play a
central role in regulating BCR signaling. Best characterized is the role of Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based
Inhibitory Motif (ITIM)-containing inhibitory receptors that become activated upon co-aggregation with actively
signaling BCRs. The BCR-associated Src-family kinase Lyn tyrosine phosphorylates their ITIM motifs, resulting
in the recruitment of phosphatases such as the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and the inositol phosphatase
SHIP-1 that actively suppress BCR signaling. SHIP-1 activity is increased in autoreactive B cells and plays a
critical role in maintaining B cell tolerance by suppressing PI3K-dependent signaling. How SHIP-1 is activated
in autoreactive B cells is still unclear. BCR stimulation by itself, without recruitment of known ITIM-containing
inhibitory receptors, activates SHIP-1. In an unbiased screen, detecting tyrosine phosphorylated receptors that
bind SHIP-1, we identified CD79A as containing the SHIP-1 docking site. CD79A and CD79B form a
heterodimer that mediates signal transduction following BCR stimulation. Each chain contains a single
Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM). Phosphorylation of the two conserved tyrosines in the
ITAMs is the critical first step towards activating signaling. Previously, we showed that in autoreactive B cells
CD79A ITAMs are predominantly monophosphorylated. Studies of cell lines expressing chimeric receptors
suggest that monophosphorylation of the CD79A Y182 residue biases signaling towards inhibitory signaling.
We hypothesize that CD79A ITAMs can act like a molecular switch wherein ITAM monophosphorylation tips
the balance towards inhibitory signaling by preferentially recruiting the regulatory proteins Lyn and SHIP-1. To
test this hypothesis, we have generated novel mouse models in which the ability of the CD79A ITAM to
become tyrosine phosphorylated is variably restricted to monophosphorylation of the membrane proximal
(Y182) or membrane distal (Y193) residue. In Aim 1 we will determine how individual CD79A ITAM tyrosines
impact BCR signalosome composition and downstream signaling, both directly and indirectly via co-
aggregated ITIM-containing receptors. In Aim 2 we will determine the impact of individual CD79A ITAM
tyrosines on biological processes such as B cell development, B cell activation, antibody responses, and B cell
tolerance. Specifically, we will determine if CD79A ITAM monophosphorylation of CD79A Y182 drives the
anergic phenotype of autoreactive B cells. These studies will provide unique insights into the earliest activating
and inhibitory events that shape B cell activation and tolerance. It will also lead to a better understanding of
ITAM biology with direct translational implications for chimeric antigen receptor design."
10901840,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the 10th leading cause of death in the US. A major
barrier to suicide prevention has been that the cutting-edge scientific advances that have occurred in the past
few decades have not yet been translated and implemented into clinical practice settings. We propose the
development of a practice-based Center for Suicide Research and Prevention (CSRP) that will support the
development, deployment, and evaluation of practice-ready and deployment-focused interventions aimed at
improving the identification and effective treatment of those at risk of suicide. This Center will be a collaborative
effort between researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders at Mass General Brigham (MGB) and Harvard
University. Our focus is on improving the identification and prevention of suicide-related behaviors (SRBs)
among patients presenting for treatment at emergency departments (EDs) and psychiatric inpatient units.
Decades of research have shown that 50% of people who die by suicide are seen in a healthcare setting within
one month before their death, 40% visit an ED the year before their death, and the suicide rate is highest in the
weeks immediately following discharge from a psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. Our first aim is to build and
maintain a cohesive and innovative transdisciplinary Center dedicated to advancing suicide prevention. This
will be accomplished via the work of our proposed Administrative Core and Methods Core. Our second aim
is to conduct four practice-focused research projects that target prediction and prevention of suicidal behaviors
in ED and inpatient settings. Our Signature Project (SIG) will implement a previously-develop machine learning
prediction algorithm based on electronic health record (EHR) and self-report data collected in the ED and
randomly assign the clinicians of 4,000 patients to receive (experimental condition) or not receive (control
condition) the predicted probability that their patient will make a suicide attempt after ED discharge. We will test
the impact of this intervention on the suicide attempt rate and clinician decision-making. The SIG also will
examine clinician acceptability and adherence, prediction model improvement, and the development of
treatment optimization rules regarding patients' likelihood of benefiting from hospitalization versus alternative
treatments. Our three Exploratory Projects (EXP): (EXP1) will use the SIG prediction model to identify ED
patients at risk of suicidal behavior and experimentally test the effectiveness of an enhanced outreach
intervention administered in collaboration with a community partner – Samaritans of Boston; (EXP2) will
implement and test EHR-based risk algorithms in two inpatient units with a special focus on the use of social
determinants of health to improve prediction among under-represented adolescents; and (EXP3) will test a
just-in-time adaptive intervention using an innovative micro-randomized trial design to connect at-risk patients
with care when needed most. The third aim of the Center is to support education, dissemination, and
implementation efforts that will have a significant and sustained effect on suicide prevention."

 Rapid and sensitive point of care tests that can detect all forms of drug resistance are urgently needed to
enable appropriate treatment for TB. Molecular drug susceptibility tests (mDSTs) which use nucleic acid
amplification techniques to detect mutations associated with resistance to the primary tuberculosis (TB) drugs
isoniazid (INH), and rifampin (RIF), and in a few rare cases fluoroquinolones (FQs) have demonstrated the
potential of this susceptibility testing approach. However, current mDSTs are unable to detect the large numbers
of mutations which encode for resistance to the critical new anti-tubercular drug, bedaquiline (BDQ), and linezolid
(LZD). These new drugs along with FQs and another new drug Pretominid (Pa) comprise the backbone of the
most promising TB treatments of the future. Yet, without the availability of companion mDSTs, the world risks
losing these new drugs to drug resistance within a few years of deployment. We propose to use innovative new
fluidic and assay designs to enable detection of hundreds of different mutations encoding FQ, LZD, and BDQ
resistance using the standard Cepheid assay cartridge. This new test would retain all the advantages of current
Cepheid TB assays, a robust manufacturing and instrument placement base enabled by the high volume of
assays currently produced. This research program will include 4 aims. Aim 1. Develop mis-match tolerant or
“sloppy” molecular beacons (SMBs) that identify mutations associated with FQ and LZD resistance that are
optimized for ultimate use in the new three-phase highly multiplex system to be developed in this grant. Aim 2.
BDQ assay development detecting mutations in atpE and a new SMB tiling approach that queries the entire Mtb
Rv0678 gene to identify mutations causal of BDQ resistance. Aim 3 Optimize three-phase cartridge fluidics for
highly multiplex mutation detection. Aim 4. Perform an initial laboratory and clinical validation study of the final
aim 1-3 assays using stored clinical samples."

 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an uncontrolled host response to infection and is a leading
cause of death in intensive care units. Liver dysfunction contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality
associated with sepsis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play a critical role in hepatic immune and
metabolic functions, but their specific role in bacterial infection and sepsis remains poorly understood.
 Our study focused on HSPA12B, a member of the HSP70 family, shows distinct expression in liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), being prominent in periportal LSECs and reduced in midzonal LSECs.
Interestingly, mice lacking endothelial cell HSPA12B (eHSPA12B-/-) exhibit disrupted hepatic Kupffer zonation
and impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis even under normal conditions. Furthermore, we induced sepsis in these
mice and observed severe LSEC capillarization, along with increased bacterial load and lactate accumulation
compared to WT septic mice. These findings highlight the importance of eHSPA12B in maintaining LSEC
phenotype and as well as hepatic immune and metabolic function during sepsis.
 Further investigations revealed that eHSPA12B is necessary for GATA4 nuclear translocation in LSECs.
Endothelial cell-specific GATA4 deficiency resulted in an abnormal LSEC phenotype, impaired Kupffer cell
zonation, and dysfunction of hepatic gluconeogenesis. These data suggest a cooperative role of eGATA4 and
HSPA12B in maintaining the specialized phenotype and function of LSECs. Patients with NASH/cirrhosis are
more susceptible to bacterial infections and sepsis. Our study found decreased HSPA12B expression and
impaired GATA4 transcriptional activity in LSECs of NASH/cirrhosis patients, suggesting their contribution to
NASH/cirrhosis associated hepatic immune and metabolic dysfunction and increased susceptibility to bacterial
infections.
 Based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that eHSPA12B serves as a novel co-transcriptional factor of
GATA4 to maintain the unique phenotype and function of LSECs, and that functional LSECs play a crucial role
in maintaining Kupffer cell zonation, enhancing bacterial clearance, and regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis
during bacterial infections and sepsis. To critically evaluate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims.
Aim 1. Investigate how HSPA12B and GATA4 cooperatively regulate LSEC phenotype and function during
sepsis. Aim 2. Define the mechanisms by which LSECs regulate hepatic Kupffer cell zonation and bacterial
clearance during sepsis. Aim3. Investigate the mechanisms by which LSECs regulate hepatic
gluconeogenesis.
 Successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the novel role of LSEC in regulating
hepatic immune and metabolic function. These findings could be an important foundation for the development
of innovative therapeutic approaches to enhance hepatic hepatic immune and metabolic function, leading to
improved outcomes in patients with bacterial infections and sepsis."
10834043,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are used to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D)
due to their ability to increase urinary glucose excretion; however, new evidence suggests SGLT2 inhibition
also improves skeletal muscle insulin action as a mechanism to improve glycemia. Recent studies in humans
and rodent models report SGLT2 inhibitor treatment increases insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, even after
accounting for urinary glucose losses. Despite the clinical significance of these findings, mechanisms to
explain this effect remain unresolved. The current project will test the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitor
treatment stimulates changes in skeletal muscle fat metabolism that serve to improve skeletal muscle insulin
action. Our preliminary studies in model systems demonstrate SGLT2 inhibitor treatment alters mitochondrial
function, can induce energetic stress signaling (AMP-activated protein kinase), and even lower accumulation of
bioactive lipids known to negatively regulate insulin signaling. These findings support our hypothesis and
highlight the need to better understand the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on human skeletal muscle given its
critical role in regulating whole-body glucose metabolism. The current project will also test the hypothesis that
SGLT2 inhibition may provide therapeutic benefit (via improved skeletal muscle metabolism) before the onset
of T2D. Treating individuals with prediabetes with SGLT2 inhibitors is an especially attractive option given their
dysglycemia, high risk for advanced cardiometabolic disease and limited current treatment options (i.e.,
lifestyle modification and metformin). Taken together, the overall objectives of the current proposal are to
identify mechanisms of how SGLT2 inhibition improves skeletal muscle insulin action and test the ability of
SGLT2 inhibition to improve skeletal muscle metabolism among individuals with prediabetes. The current
project is a randomized, double-blind, 13-week intervention comparing SGLT2 inhibition with placebo among
overweight and obese adults with prediabetes. Participants will undergo robust metabolic phenotyping before
and in response to the intervention to achieve the following specific aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that
SGLT2 inhibition improves skeletal muscle insulin action and insulin signaling in prediabetes; Aim 2: Determine
mechanisms responsible for increased skeletal muscle fat oxidation during SGLT2 inhibition; Aim 3: Determine
the extent to which SGLT2 inhibition lowers skeletal muscle diacylglycerol and ceramide content in
prediabetes. The proposed studies can be expected to generate new information regarding the mechanisms of
how SGLT2 inhibition can improve skeletal muscle metabolism and provide new understanding of the
therapeutic potential of using SGLT2 inhibitors as a treatment for prediabetes."

This K99/R00 proposal examines the joint impacts of local alcohol and cannabis policies on violence in
California before and after recreational cannabis legalization in 2018. Self-directed and interpersonal violence
are leading causes of death and injury in the United States. Changes in alcohol and cannabis use, driven by
state cannabis legalization policies, may be important but unrecognized contributors to these outcomes.
Alcohol’s role in violence is well established. Evidence on cannabis’ effects on violence is limited and mixed.
Cannabis legalization could lower rates of alcohol-related violence through cannabis-alcohol substitution.
Existing research on cannabis legalization often focuses on state-level variation. However, most states defer to
city and county governments to implement cannabis legalization policies, including determining where outlets
are located. Local control results in enormous local-level heterogeneity in local policies and outlet density. High
geographic density of alcohol outlets increases rates of violence; recent studies report similar patterns for
cannabis outlets. In legalizing states, cannabis outlets are being disproportionately co-located with alcohol
outlets in low-socioeconomic status (SES) communities. However, no studies examine if and how local alcohol
and cannabis policies together contribute to intoxicant saturation (i.e., high densities of both alcohol and
cannabis outlets) in low-SES communities. Further, there is no evidence on whether co-located cannabis and
alcohol outlets interact to affect the health of community residents.
We will perform quasi-experimental geospatial analyses of publicly-derived policy, outlet, and administrative
health data to: (1) assess how alcohol and cannabis policies in 241 California cities and counties impact outlet
density and geographic co-location; (2) determine the interactive effects of alcohol and cannabis outlet
densities on rates of emergency department visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and deaths due to self-harm and
assault throughout California; (3) evaluate how the relationships documented above contribute to disparities in
alcohol and cannabis outlet co-location, densities, and effects on self-harm and assault.
The research plan is complemented by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of
California, San Francisco and NIAAA-funded Prevention Research Center. The plan builds on the applicant’s
background in violence prevention research and includes new training in alcohol and drug use as contributors
to violence, alcohol and drug control policies, and geospatial statistical methods. The combined research and
training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent epidemiology research career focused on
how to design optimal alcohol and drug policies to prevent violence and reduce health disparities.
This research aligns with NIAAA’s strategic goal to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of new
policies for preventing alcohol-related consequences such as violence. This research is urgently needed as
other localities consider cannabis legalization and models for regulation."

Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide, especially in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs). High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the main causative agents of cervical
cancer and its precursor lesions; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended HPV DNA
testing for cervical cancer screening in LMICs. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been
widely used for HPV DNA detection, they are restricted to centralized clinical laboratories due to the need for
labor-intensive procedures and expensive equipment. Here, we propose to develop a simple, rapid, highly
sensitive, and specific CRISPR-on-paper diagnostic platform to simultaneously detect multiple high-risk HPV
genotypes for cervical cancer screening at the point of care. This innovative diagnostic system is based on our
recently developed all-in-one dual CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR) assay, which combines the simplicity and
high sensitivity of isothermal nucleic acid amplification with the high specificity of CRISPR detection. To develop
a low-cost, multiplexed molecular detection technology, we will incorporate the AIOD-CRISPR assay into a
paper-based microfluidics platform. To eliminate the need for complex electronic instruments, we will take
advantage of an exothermic reaction to generate chemical heat for the CRISPR-on-paper system by using a
disposable hand warmer, thus enabling instrument-free cervical cancer screening. The detection results can be
read by the naked eye or reported by a programmed smartphone without the need for an expensive optical
detector. We will rigorously evaluate and validate the clinical applications of our CRISPR-on-paper diagnostic
system by testing clinical samples in collaboration with clinicians and healthcare workers in UConn Health and
Zambia. If successful, the proposed project has an important impact on global health by providing a simple,
affordable, and sensitive method for rapid screening of cervical cancer in resource-poor settings. As a platform
technology, the proposed CRISPR-on-paper diagnostic system can be easily adapted to detect other emerging
pathogens."

to achieve low disease activity and/or limit progressive joint damage in many patients, and 4) lack of
robust biomarkers necessary to personalize appropriate treatment strategies. We propose that
cellular and molecular variation in synovial tissue underlies this heterogeneity and that understanding
the basis for this will improve the prediction of disease course and provide a rationale for the timely

sustained collaborative global team-science, the AIM-for-RA Team has already developed state-of-

targets, identified disease biomarkers, and opened new opportunities in disease prevention. However,
it remains unclear how molecular interactions in the synovium relate to the evolution of defined
clinical outcomes, from the at-risk preclinical period to arthritis onset, and then through to synovitis

pathways and dynamic crosstalk to environmental exposures, disease outcomes and treatment
response, thereby reconstructing the disease pathogenesis trajectory. In a DMARD-naïve RA cross-
sectional synovial biopsy-based study of 50 RA patients across 9 sites using harmonized protocols and
integrated technologies, Aim 1 will deliver high-quality multimodal clinical phenotype and histology
data, along with synovial tissue and other biosamples, to evaluate how synovial cellular and molecular
pathways relate to disease onset. With longitudinal follow-up and repeat biopsy of these individuals
after methotrexate monotherapy, Aim 2 will address whether synovial signatures and multi-modal
data predict first-line methotrexate response, or failure in patients with early previously untreated
disease. Finally, in Aim 3, in patients with methotrexate inadequate response we will address whether
distinct synovial cellular or molecular features predict a positive response to biologic therapies directly
targeting these features. The outcomes of this program will have potential for rapid translational
application to improve treatment outcomes at all RA disease stages. Collectively, the collaborative,

The current state of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods in neurooncology offers great
potential for providing rich characterizations of structural, physiological, and metabolic character-
istics of brain tumors, especially gliomas, which are complex and highly heterogeneous cancers.
Glioblastoma (GBM), in particular, has a grim prognosis, with median overall survival (OS) less than
15 months with relatively little improvement in the past 15 years since the Stupp protocol was
introduced. Many experimental treatments are being pursued; however, OS has largely remained
stagnant. Some of the obstacles in improving this outcome have been 1) disease heterogeneity,
which both renders it difficult to detect treatment effects in Phase 1 or even Phase 2 trials, and calls
for personalized, rather than one-size fits-all, treatment strategies; 2) methods used for tumor
characterization based on size, enhancement, perfusion and diffusion properties are relatively
crude and don't fully leverage the richness of imaging data or their spatial heterogeneity. Quanti-
tative imaging and machine learning (QIML) methods developed in the past decade have shown
great potential for dissecting the spatial, temporal and inter-patient heterogeneity of GBM; for
discoveringrelationships between imaging and molecular characteristics ; foroffering personalized
predictions of clinical outcome; and for leveraging subtle multi-parametric relationships in the data
to detect peri-tumoral infiltration or distinguish treatment related changes, i.e., pseudo-progression
(PsP), from true tumor recurrence. Our group has been at the forefront of QIML, with emphasis on
a) obtaining rich imaging phenotypes relying on multi-parametric signals, texture parameters, shape
properties, spatial patterns derived from atlas registration, and biophysical models of tumor growth,
and b) integrating such imaging signatures using machine learning into predictors of clinical
outcome, early recurrence from peri-tumoral infiltration, PsP, and radiologic subtypes of GBM.
Despite their promise, QIML methods have a notorious limitation: they might overfit specific
datasets from which they are derived, and might display poor reproducibility under real-life
conditions of variable scanner types and imaging protocols. In this proposal we aim to leverage the
recently formed ReSPOND (Radiomics Signatures for PrecisiON Diagnostics) consortium, to
integrate, harmonize, and analyze 4,578 datasets from 14 centers around the world, and hence
more appropriately train and cross-validate QIML tools for a wider generalizability. This consortium
will generate an unprecedented database of diverse and carefully harmonized sets of MRI and
clinical measures, and aims to provide the community with robust and reproducible QIML models
contributing to precision diagnostics and personalize treatment for this dreaded brain cancer."
10845497,"Among couples trying to conceive, 10-15% will be affected by infertility, which can be caused by
impaired gametogenesis. Effective post-transcriptional gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)
is crucial for normal gametogenesis, with mutations in RBPs impairing such regulation and causing
infertility in humans. For example, the Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ) family of RBPs are essential for
human fertility, because during spermatogenesis they regulate translation of a subset of mRNAs by
binding to their 3′ UTRs; their molecular mechanism of action was understood only after their
Drosophila ortholog was identified and studied genetically. However, the full repertoire of RBPs that are
essential for gametogenesis is currently unknown. To fully understand the complex post-transcriptional
gene regulation during gametogenesis, it is critical to identify novel RBPs that are important for these
processes and elucidate their molecular functions and mechanisms of action.
 We have recently identified three previously uncharacterized RBPs (MARF1, Tanenashi, and
CG44249) that are essential for fertility in Drosophila. Our data suggest that MARF1, which is
expressed in oocytes and is required for female fertility, regulates mRNA poly-A tail length during
oogenesis. Tanenashi, which is expressed in spermatocytes and is required for male fertility, plays
roles in promoting the expression and splicing of male fertility factor genes containing mega-base-sized
introns with highly repetitive DNA sequence on the Y chromosome during spermatogenesis. CG44249,
which is expressed in ovaries and is required for female fertility, likely plays a role in splicing regulation
during oogenesis. We also showed that a fourth RBP (Loqs-PB), which is important for female fertility
and germline stem cell maintenance in ovaries, regulates the length of microRNAs in ovaries. These
four RBPs are conserved from flies to humans.
 Using Drosophila, I now propose to further investigate these four RBPs, and determine their
precise molecular functions and mechanisms of action in gametogenesis. By investigating mutant flies
in vivo and the proteins in vitro, we will test our hypothesis that: (i) these RBPs each bind specific target
RNAs by recognizing specific RNA sequence and/or structure motifs, and (ii) thereby promote or inhibit
the processing of bound RNAs at specific molecular steps, allowing highly regulated spatiotemporal
expression of targeted genes during gametogenesis.
 These studies will advance our fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of post-
transcriptional regulation of gene expression, especially by regulating the mRNA poly-A tail length,
mRNA splicing, and microRNA length, during gametogenesis, providing potential for improved
diagnosis and treatment of human infertility."

Use of nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) among youth is a persistent public health problem in the United
States. Initiation of NTPs in adolescence is associated with increased frequency of use, adverse impacts on
brain development, nicotine addiction, and increased risk of cancer. Major factors associated with NTP use
include youth-targeted marketing and media advertisements for these products; this is particularly true for
Black, Hispanic, and sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. These youth are intentionally targeted with
messaging by nicotine and tobacco companies through carefully curated media advertisements and marketing
meant to build trust and recruit new users. With the proliferation of social media, this is more pervasive as
these youth are now exposed to messaging from both tobacco company marketing and self-generated content
from social media users. However, it is not well known how these youth are exposed to NTP-related
misinformation on social media and how these exposures are associated with susceptibility to NTP initiation.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to first identify NTP-related misinformation on a variety of youth-oriented
social media platforms and then assess associations between misinformation exposure and susceptibility to
NTP initiation among youth, particularly youth who identify as Black, Hispanic, and/or SGM. Informed by these
results, we will develop health communication messages to counteract misinformation and assess their
acceptability to youth. Core to this proposal is the use of a Youth Participatory Action Research approach via
the development of a Youth Collaborative (n=20). Comprised of an inclusive group of youth ages 13-17, the
Youth Collaborative will play an integral role in completing the following specific aims: (1) classify the most
pervasive and salient NTP-related misinformation on youth-oriented social media platforms via human-
centered design (HCD) activities, social media data collection, qualitative and automated data analysis
processes, and social network analysis; (2) assess social media-based exposure to NTP-related
misinformation and associations with susceptibility via a cross-sectional survey of with 700 youth ages 13-17
with oversampling of Black, Hispanic, and SGM youth; and (3) develop health communication messages using
HCD activities and assess the acceptability of these messages with a subsample of youth from Aim 2 who are
susceptible to NTP initiation. Our interdisciplinary team has collaborated for over a decade to examine youth
attitudes and behaviors related to nicotine and tobacco products, social media use, engagement with media,
and community-based participatory research. We will leverage this knowledge and experience to complete
these aims, the results of which can be used to develop scalable interventions that can counteract targeted
misinformation and prevent NTP initiation among Black, Hispanic, and SGM youth and ultimately eliminate
disparities in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality, including cancer, among these populations."
10832057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men. Typically,
treatment for PCa involves blocking androgen synthesis or androgen receptor (AR) signaling known as
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Although initial response rates are promising, all men eventually progress
on ADT and develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) concomitant with metastatic burden.
Metastatic CRPC is incurable and an increasing number of men are developing a highly lethal variant of CRPC
known as aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC). AR signaling is lost in AVPC rendering the existing
hormone targeting treatments ineffective. About a third of AVPC tumors also express neuroendocrine (NE)
genes and are classified as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), which is the focus of our studies. Very
few therapies exist and only offer minimal survival benefits in this setting. Hence, functional assessment of
other protein drug targets is needed to effectively treat NEPC. We have previously shown that kinase signaling
pathways may be promising therapeutic alternatives in CRPC. The goal of our research is to understand the
mechanisms regulating increased kinase gene expression, leading to kinase pathway activation, and how to
effectively target these kinases in NEPC. Our hypothesis is that RET mRNA and protein up-regulation is driven
by ASCL1, a master neural transcriptional regulator, and that RET kinase-mediated activity serves as a
therapeutic vulnerability in NEPC. It is known that RET mutations are key drivers and therapeutic targets in
other cancers with NE features such as papillary thyroid carcinoma and small cell lung cancer. Importantly, the
contribution of RET kinase signaling in NEPC viability is not entirely elucidated. Our preliminary data shows
that RET kinase is overexpressed via activation of a neuronal differentiation transcription factor, ASCL1, and
enzymatically activated in mouse models and organoids of NEPC, in human cell lines, and clinical NEPC
tumors. Our work also shows that RET kinase inhibition reduces in vivo xenograft tumor growth and in in vitro
mouse organoid models of NEPC. The goals of this project are to: 1) confirm ASCL1 as a direct transcriptional
regulator of RET, 2) define a RET activity signature and assess the association of this signature to treatment
resistance and NEPC in clinical samples, and 3) optimize co-targeting strategies with novel RET inhibitors in
NEPC model systems. These goals are collectively designed to investigate the mechanism of RET kinase as a
key therapeutic target in NEPC, an incurable variant of PCa. While kinase inhibitors are approved for treatment
of several epithelial cancers, clinical trials of kinase inhibitors in PCa have been disappointing. Our data
indicate this is likely due to lack of appropriate patient stratification, administered in the wrong clinical context,
and improper combination therapies. Hence, the outcomes of the proposed work will provide new insights into
select combination therapies for treating NEPC, using re-purposed kinase inhibitors that may be implemented
quickly in clinical trials of patients with this subset of lethal PCa."

The fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), are deeply impacted by systemic
educational inequities in the U.S. public school system, creating barriers to science, often among racial minorities
and individuals from underserved communities. Results of our recent work suggests that some of these barriers can
be mitigated through weekly STEM enrichment activities in underserved high school classrooms, facilitated by a
team of near-peer mentors (NPMs) from the same or nearby communities; high school students gain more positive
attitudes toward science and scientists, increased content knowledge, and increased understanding of the relevance
of science in their lives by the conclusion of the program. Our objectives in this proposal are to disseminate
sustainable, refined NPM-led science enrichment programs with enhanced in-classroom and virtual mentoring
in underserved classrooms through partnerships within our home state, and to further investigate shifts in
participants’ attitudes toward science. In pursuing these objectives, we aim to: (1) Determine whether enhanced
in-classroom mentoring, paired with virtual mentoring can be used as effective strategies to engage underserved
students; (2) Elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) for students’ attitudinal changes towards science with near-
peer mentoring; and (3) Evaluate effective strategies for the dissemination and the sustainability of NPM programs.
We will partner with minority-serving universities in Maryland, and local high schools in their communities to
disseminate the NPM model. We hypothesize that dissemination of this enhanced NPM model will lead to a network
of sustainable programs that will promote shifts in students’ classroom performance, attitudes, engagement, and
growth mindsets. Our expertise puts us in a unique position to train others in implementation of this model, thus
increasing the number of under-represented students who have access to meaningful and preparatory experiences
in STEM. We will use a matched comparison group design to evaluate the efficacy of the near-peer mentorship
programs for students, and fidelity surveys to evaluate the consistency of program implementation across sites. The
dissemination of a sustainable NPM model will help us accomplish our long-term goal of addressing systemic
educational inequities, and increase our capacity for recruitment of students from underserved and underrepresented
backgrounds into STEM internships, providing an element of continuity for participants. The proposed work will
also provide a blueprint for other SEPA programs to disseminate evidence-based outreach programs."
10832569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is the premier data set worldwide for the study of aging in all its
complexities. The RAND HRS Longitudinal File and its supplementary files, that constitute the RAND HRS
Data System, have been instrumental in facilitating the use of the HRS in the work of thousands of researchers
in the U.S. and around the world. This project will substantially expand the RAND HRS Data System to realize
the full potential of the HRS and to facilitate rigorous multidisciplinary research on health and aging.
 We propose to create innovative summary measures and improve upon existing ones. One main effort will
be to create indices of high-level concepts such as health and disability, psycho-social construct variables, and
subjective well-being and to develop estimates of pension and Social Security wealth. We will develop these
measures involving experts so as to provide researchers in one discipline with state-of-knowledge measures
from other disciplines, thus encouraging transdisciplinary research. A second effort will be to develop new data
products such as a longitudinal Respondent-Parent file and Respondent-Helper files to advance research on
long-term care. We would investigate the feasibility of a restricted data file that would incorporate variables
derived from administrative Social Security data. We will improve the derivation of a number of existing
variables in the RAND HRS and maintain and update all supplementary data products and new data elements
as additional waves of HRS data become available.
 This will be a collaborative effort between the HRS and the RAND HRS teams. The HRS team will bring
the scientific expertise of the HRS Co-Investigators to the development of new data elements that can be used
across all disciplines. The RAND team will bring methodological and technical skills and over twenty years of
experience in programming using the HRS data. The proposed expansion of the content of the RAND HRS
Data System requires innovative use of the rich and complex original HRS data. We will develop data elements
using rigorous, systematic methods in consultation with experts, with focus on longitudinal consistency.
 The new data elements in the expanded and improved RAND HRS Data System will strengthen an
important data infrastructure and will facilitate downstream high-quality multidisciplinary research in high-
priority areas of NIA in health and aging, including, for example, investigations of disparities in health and
subjective well-being, the personal, interpersonal and societal causes of physical and mental health at older
ages, the burden of caregiving on family members, and disparities in the use and provision of informal care.
With the availability of the expanded RAND HRS Data System, researchers will be able to more rapidly
address new and evolving issues and challenges facing burgeoning older populations, including their care,
financial, and health needs."
10832594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The average American undergoes nine surgical or interventional procedures over their lifetime, many related to
diseases of the digestive track or conditions associated with obesity. Despite being common, most of these
procedures have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness. In addition, the best practices
needed to accomplish the best outcomes, population-level results, patient-reported perspectives, and cost
considerations have yet to be addressed. As healthcare systems strive to deliver greater value and increase
the effectiveness of the care they deliver, addressing these gaps is critical. One reason for the shortfall in
rigorous clinical research in gastrointestinal conditions commonly treated with surgery is a paucity of formal
training in health services, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness research for surgeons. To address this
need, we propose the continuation of the University of Washington's T32 fellowship in clinical, health services,
and comparative effectiveness research for surgeons. This fellowship involves didactic training and practical
experience in advanced clinical research methodology focused on interventions related to the gastrointestinal
system, diabetes, and obesity-related conditions. The training is focused in 6 areas (research using
observational data, patient-centered outcome and preference assessment, health economics and behavioral
economics in healthcare, implementation and health system science, clinical trials, and research operations
management) and is intended to develop surgeon-scholars who will be successful scientists and leaders in
academic medicine. The didactic component includes coursework that results in a Master of Public Health or
Master of Science degree. Trainees complete a set of projects and studies using the full spectrum of research
methods and approaches. The trainee's experience is fostered by a structured mentorship program, led by
investigators who have a career commitment to training and demonstrated success in high-level research and
integrating evidence into practice. Many of the projects led by fellows involve collaboration with a unique,
statewide data sharing network of 45 hospitals and a national research platform of over 40 hospitals in 15
states. These networks allow for observational cohort studies and support the conduct of randomized trials in
the management of common gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., appendicitis and diverticulitis). Trainees
participate in the fellowship for two years and then serve an additional 3-5 years of clinical training. Past and
current fellows have had high levels of research success judged by publications and presentations, and the
program has had a considerable impact on trainees, the community, and the nation. Prior trainees who have
completed their clinical training are now taking academic positions and have been finding success as
independent investigators. The significant changes planned for the training in this cycle include a greater focus
on clinical trials and learning health systems research related to gastrointestinal conditions. This emphasis
parallels the increased number of funded RCTs and health system science studies being led by the mentors."
10832595,"Longitudinal studies of the population near, through and after the retirement stage, such as the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), play an important role in aging research because they provide data from a life
course perspective, allowing researchers to make population-level causal inference. Because such data
collection is a social interaction between researchers and the population, the methods employed to collect
data in these studies need to accommodate societal changes. The aging population in the U.S. is
experiencing rapid changes. First, its racial, ethnic, and linguistic composition is being shifted by the
growing Hispanic and Asian American populations. Second, the reliance of this aging population on new
mobile and video technologies has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the
research environment for population-based data collection has also evolved, with an increased availability
of administrative records that can be integrated with survey data and the increased use of modern devices
for collecting anthropometric and biomarker data that can complement traditional, self-report survey data.
Researchers can capitalize on these naturally occurring trends and shape methodological innovations for
future longitudinal studies. For example, as the population has become accustomed to communicating via
electronic devices during the COVID-19 pandemic, population-based studies have transitioned from using
one interview mode to mixing modes, including web-based data collection and virtual interviewing.
Unfortunately, the methodological research on optimal data collection approaches for aging populations
that has been performed to date has several critical shortcomings: there is a notable lack of data on
minority subgroups, optimal approaches to obtaining consent for administrative record linkage and
biomarker data collection are unknown, methods for combatting increasing rates of attrition are needed,
and there is an absence of methodological research on the use of new technologies for data collection.
 We propose to form a network of internationally-renowned methodological and substantive experts who
are actively researching the benefits of new data collection methodologies in response to these societal
developments. The proposed network will meet regularly to shape methodological innovations specifically
for the measurement of aging populations and design studies that will produce evidence-based best
practices for this type of longitudinal measurement. There are a large number of influential longitudinal
studies of aging in the field at present that would stand to benefit from this type of coordinated, rigorous
methodological investigation of more efficient approaches to collecting longitudinal measures from (and for)
aging populations. Via a coordinated international program of training, consulting, thematic working group
meetings, and pilot research projects, we aim to set the agenda for methodological research on longitudinal
studies of aging and protect NIA investments in population-representative longitudinal studies."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects millions of people in the US and worldwide, and is becoming an increased
burden on individual and society. Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at greater
risk for development of AD. A reliable method of treatment for individuals with aMCI could help not only to
improve the lives of elderly individuals with memory impairment, but also potentially prevent or delay the
development of AD. Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation
method that shows promise for improving memory and may be applied to brain areas that are functionally
connected to the hippocampus in order to restore memory function. Because the ability to apply stimulation to
modify memory functions depends on the application of stimulation at distinct and specific sites in the complex
neuronal circuitry underlying these functions, neuroimaging guided targeting of TBS treatment will provide
individualized tailoring of therapeutic intervention needed for maximum efficacy. The proposed project will
therefore implement a novel high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) guided TBS method
to improve hippocampal-cortical connectivity and consequent episodic memory in elderly aMCI individuals with
and without genetic risk for AD. Functional MRI, scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and genetic testing will
also be used to characterize brain network changes and genetic factors that are associated with TBS related
memory restoration. The implications of TBS related memory restoration to patients affected with disorders of
memory is of great significance and of urgent need. The proposed project will therefore develop a novel
method for memory enhancement, characterize associated brain changes, contribute to the understanding of
hippocampal-cortical networks and their role in memory, and ultimately provide a novel therapeutic approach to
human memory disorders. The data from this project will demonstrate a proof-of-concept that TBS can be used
to improve memory in aMCI, and will launch an emerging and pivotal area of research that will provide
therapeutic interventions for patients afflicted with life debilitating cognitive disorders."
10832477,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammation is recognized as a major underlying mechanism for a number of diseases with an environmental
etiology that have serious pathologic outcomes such as autoimmunity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung
disease, neurodegeneration as examples. Mast cells represent a major sensory arm of the body's innate
immune system by functioning as environmental `sensors' to communicate with other physiological and/or
immune responses due to their widespread tissue presence at mucosal surfaces, near blood vessels and the
nervous system. Through funding from R01 ES019311, we have begun to unravel novel mechanisms of non-
IgE mast cell activation that contribute to inflammation. While mast cells are implicated as pathogenic in a
number of diseases beyond allergy little is known on mechanisms and even less is known regarding how
environmental toxicants trigger mast cell responses that contribute to these disease outcomes. Therefore, our
overarching research goal has been focused on delineating the role of mast cells in environmental health
through better understanding of their role as first responders in environmental insult, resulting effects on innate
and adaptive immunity, and their communication with other cells and physiological systems. Our research has
uncovered novel non-IgE mediated mechanisms of mast cell activation driven by particulates (e.g.
nanoparticles, air pollution particulate matter, silica, etc) that contributes to adverse outcomes in the pulmonary
and cardiovascular system. In addition, through genome wide association studies using the hybrid mouse
diversity panel as well as transcriptomics studies we have uncovered novel genetic regulation of non-IgE mast
cell activation driven by particulates. In particular, we have found a regulatory role for thioredoxin interacting
protein (Txnip) in non-IgE mast cell activation. In this proposal, we will investigate both redox-independent and
-dependent Txnip regulation of mast cell activation by environmental particulates (nanoparticles and ambient
particulate matter) and its influence on G protein-coupled receptors, glycolysis, redox regulation and granule
exocytosis. In addition, we will investigate the role of Txnip using mast cells from patients with chronic
idiopathic urticaria (a mast cell activation disorder largely driven by non-IgE mechanisms and which is thought
to be triggered by environmental exposures). Our overall goal is to delineate the role mast cells in
environmental health through better understanding of their role as first responders in environmental insult, their
activation by particulates and novel mechanisms of non-IgE activation that contributes to disease outcomes."
10833545,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Intragenomic conflicts are fueled by rapidly evolving selfish genetic elements,
which emerge intrinsically within genomes. If left unchecked, these can be disastrous to
the individual and/or the population. Thus, such conflicts induce strong pressures to
innovate opposing mechanisms of repression. This is patently manifest in paradoxical
meiotic drive systems, in which the wildtype activities of selfish genes can have
deleterious consequences to bias the sex ratio of progeny (typically eliminating males),
or to induce frank sterility. However, relatively little is known about the molecular
mechanisms of meiotic drive genes and their control. Our recent work provides first
evidence that related, recently-evolved, sex-biasing and sterility-inducing systems in the
non-model fruitfly D. simulans are suppressed by endogenous siRNA loci. This provides
a unique foundation to study how meiotic drive loci are tamed at the post-transcriptional
level. Although little is generally known about the biochemical function of selfish meiotic
drive loci, our data support testable models in which these D. simulans distorter gene
products may interfere with chromatin packing in sperm. Finally, we will examine the
broader evolutionary implications for how endogenous siRNAs may unlock maps of
intragenomic conflicts in multiple Drosophila species, and examine a rationale for
analogous molecular battles during mammalian meiosis. Our multidisciplinary
investigations will elucidate mechanisms that link tissue-specific de novo gene activity
and small RNAs with rapid genome dynamics that may impose the reproductive isolation
of individuals, potentially early steps on the path towards speciation."
10833617,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cell migration is required for many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic
development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. As a process that involves concerted action of multiple
ensembles of molecules over the length of the entire cell, cell migration cannot be understood using
conventional molecular approaches alone without considering sensing, actuation, and control at the whole cell
level. This project seeks to approach migrating cells in a top-down manner as an integrated mechanochemical
system. Based on observations that likely represent the manifestation of a complex network of molecular
interactions, we may deduct how the underlying machine operates. The project will be facilitated by the
development of new technologies, including 3D printing of polyacrylamide hydrogels and machine learning for
cell tracking, traction force microscopy, and super resolution imaging. We will address three important aspects.
First, we will ask how cells initiate migration through a process known as symmetry breaking, which causes a
symmetrically spreading cell to initiate directional migration. We will examine various anisotropic properties of
the substrate as potential symmetry breaking cues. In addition, the function of filopodia as possible sensors for
symmetry breaking will be studied with imaging and pharmacological approaches. Second, we will address
several poorly understood aspects of 2D and 3D cell migration. By following migrating cells over a long distance
at a high magnification, we expect to place the newly discovered process of contact following in the context of
cell collectives. To understand how cell shape control, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration respond to 3D
environment, we will use 3D printed polyacrylamide to create model systems and systematically vary
geometrical and mechanical parameters. We will then extend the experiments to decellularized lung scaffolds,
which have been used for tissue engineering, to determine how migration characteristics in 3D is related to the
promotion of tissue formation. Another overlooked area we will examine is the function of the tail in defining
cell polarity and mediating contact following. Third, we will seek mechanistic understanding of cellular
responses to cyclic stretching, which occurs in various tissues. A novel imaging approach will allow us to
determine the responses during the stretching and relaxation phase respectively. A combination of
experimentation and computer modeling is planned to explain why epithelial cells respond to static stretching
along the direction of forces but perpendicularly in response to cyclic stretching. We will also test the
hypothesis that responses to cyclic stretching can cause cell intercalation, a fundamentally important process in
embryonic morphogenesis. We expect our results to complement studies at the molecular level and bring
paradigm shifting insights into cell migration for both basic cell biology and repair of tissue functions."

The underlying mechanisms of brain stimulation in humans are poorly understood, especially at the level of gene
expression. To address this gap in knowledge, in the parent award, we proposed a series of three experiments
that take advantage of the opportunity to obtain high-quality human neural tissue from neurosurgical patients in
order to measure the impact of brain stimulation on gene expression. Our experiments will generate data from
human subjects that underwent neurostimulation and unstimulated control subjects to measure the impact of
stimulation on brain circuit changes and their underlying gene expression signature. Our study team has seven
years of experience analyzing gene expression using an established pipeline for studying human cortical tissue
from neurosurgical patients, including application of cutting-edge methods for measuring gene expression.
These methods include single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and the exciting addition of single nuclei
ATAC-sequencing (snATAC-seq) to understand stimulation-related changes in transcription factors and
chromatin remodeling. Our hypotheses regarding specific gene classes were developed from our published data
correlating gene expression changes with neurophysiological signatures (brain oscillations) linked with
successful memory formation. In this administrative supplement, we will integrate the multiomic datasets being
generated in the parent award with available human brain genomic datasets from BRAIN Initiative mechanisms.
We will determine how our stimulation paradigms both in vivo and in organotypic slice culture (OSC) mimic
genomic features of other human brain datasets both over development and/or with underlying disease
pathology. We will test if stimulation reverses gene expression programs relevant to disease. In Aim 1, we will
integrate our datasets with those derived across development. In Aim 2, we will integrate our datasets with those
derived from individuals with a number of brain disorders, and we will use the integrated data from Aim 1 as
comparison. In Aim 3, we will directly examine whether stimulation mimics control or disease genomic states
more closely. The experience of our research team and proven record in publishing data using neurosurgical
tissue specimens, especially within the context of genomic analyses, supports our expectations of success."

 There remains a critical need to develop synthetic methodology that increases the efficiency and diversity
of access to chemicals desired in medicinal research. In particular, fundamentally new transformations that
employ abundantly available starting materials can greatly facilitate the discovery and manufacture of new drugs.
The long-term goal of this research program is to use strong bases as catalysts and promoters for new reactions
that address major limitations in organic synthesis. The overall objective for this application is to use inexpensive
Brønsted and Lewis bases to achieve new functionalization methods of aryl halides, heteroarenes and
trifluoromethylarenes. This proposal is built on the hypothesis that strong bases can unlock previously unknown
or underutilized mechanistic processes of common organic functional groups. Specifically, the research plan will
exploit base-catalyzed aryl halide isomerizations and intermolecular halogen transfers, as well as single electron
transfer processes from base-activated organosilicates. Based on extensive preliminary results, a series of novel
arene functionalization reactions are described that are primarily targeted at improving heteroarene
derivatization. The monoselective coupling of organosilanes to trifluoromethylarenes is also presented as a
practical and broadly useful approach to difluorobenzylic compounds. The impact of these methods is
demonstrated through single-step access to compounds that were either previously inaccessible or required
tedious multistep operations, their use for late stage diversification of drug-like structures and dramatically
improved routes to specific drug candidates. Upon completion of the proposed work, chemists will have at their
disposal a set of powerful reactions that increase the efficiency, practicality and scope of access to molecules
widely desired in the pharmaceutical industry."

favorable course of movement disorders in PD, is contingent upon frequent, regular, and patient-specific exercise
regimen that is customized to the individual needs. Latter requires regular interventions from the provider and
frequent visits to the rehab facility. Lack of access, poor social support, inability to travel, home-bound status, or
pandemics are significant hurdles in delivering effective rehab to the PD patients. Our vision is to offer
customized and cost-effective PD rehab using a remotely operated technology near or at the patients’ homes.
This technology would be remotely monitored and customized online to titrate therapeutic outcomes optimized
for each patient. The proof of this concept was already established in our laboratory, a technology called dynamic
cycling. The highlight of this technology is a stationary bike operating at a rapid speed (cadence) with
programmable variability in speed and power/torque hence promoting motor performance superior to traditional
motorized bikes (i.e. static cycling). The next step towards our ultimate vision of at-home exercise therapy is
remotely operated dynamic bike. We have already built remotely operated dynamic bike; the current proposal
will objectively examine the efficacy of a novel, remotely delivered and remotely adjusted dynamic cycling
paradigm using remotely monitored motor outcomes. Comparison will be made with remote static cycling. The
study will be launched at three community based wellness locations to assure the subject safety, ease of access,
compliance, and as needed support. Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that dynamic cycling will immediately
improve the motor function in PD. The effects will be prominent on the dopamine-sensitive motor deficits. The
repetition will enhance motor improvement. The participants will use wearable sensors for the remote
assessments of motor symptoms in PD before and immediately after each exercise session. The information
from the wearable sensors and the bike will be utilized to further adjust the bike parameters for the next dynamic
cycling session. We will also measure effects on subjective ratings of motor function, cognition and balance
before, and at 0, 3, and 6 months after the cycling intervention. Aim 2 will analyze the effects of dynamic cycling
on motor fluctuations, declining response to levodopa in an early and unpredictable manner significantly affecting
the quality of life in the PD. We hypothesize that dynamic cycling will reduce the motor fluctuations in PD. The
efficacy of dynamic cycling on improvement in motor fluctuation over a 12-hour awake period will be measured
every day with the wearable sensors that communicate via secure cloud. The immediate clinical impact is that
the technology will be immediately deployed to the Veteran’s group homes, nursing homes, and community
based VA clinics. The project will provide sufficient information to carry our ultimate vision, at-home dynamic
cycling serving three critical needs: 1) customized therapy, 2) easy access, and 3) safety and cost-effectiveness."
10835068,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infertility occurs in approximately 15% of women of reproductive age in the United States. Approximately half of
the cases involve impaired ovulation, the cause of which is often elusive. The aim of this project is to achieve
new understanding of ovulatory defects that will serve as a foundation for effective treatment of infertility. It is
known that obesity negatively impacts female fertility and ovulation, but the underlying mechanism remains to
be elucidated. Recent findings highlight the crucial role of preovulatory ovarian vascular remodeling in successful
ovulation: the ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge induces a series of vascular remodeling processes in the
ovary, including changes in vascular permeability, vessel contraction and formation of new blood vessels.
CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins alpha and beta (C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, jointly abbreviated C/EBPα/β) are
rapidly induced in granulosa cells by the LH surge and function as important regulators of ovulation. Based on
our preliminary data, which show the profound effects of C/EBPα/β deficiency on ovarian vascular remodeling in
mice, we hypothesize that C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are key mediators by which the LH surge controls vascular
remodeling in preovulatory ovaries. Given obesity’s negative impact on vascular function in general and on
ovarian blood flow in women in particular, we also propose the novel concept that ovarian vascular remodeling
is a key mediator between obesity and ovulation failure. This proposal first seeks to use murine models of
ovulation failure and disrupted ovarian vascular remodeling to identify their regulatory mechanisms downstream
of the LH surge, then addresses the knowledge deficit around obesity’s impact on ovarian vasculature. To
achieve these goals we will apply 3-dimensional quantitative intravital imaging to a transgenic mouse line with
ovary-specific ablation of C/EBPα/β to first define the specific vascular remodeling events regulated by C/EBPα/β
in preovulatory ovaries, then determine in a diet-induced obese mouse model the impact of obesity on the activity
of C/EBPα/β and vascular remodeling during ovulation. We will further seek understanding of cell type-specific
mechanisms regulating preovulatory vascular remodeling and ovulation using single-cell, next-generation
sequencing technologies; these approaches will also reveal whether epigenetic mechanisms regulating
chromatin accessibility play a key role in preovulatory vascular remodeling and ovulation, and whether C/EBPα/β
mediate this interaction. Successful completion of the proposed studies will advance our understanding of
ovulation regulation and have a major impact by elucidating links among obesity, epigenetic regulation, and
ovarian function, thus enabling improved treatment of many cases of female infertility."

Universal influenza vaccines should be possible if conserved antigens of influenza are effectively targeted and
effective antiviral immune responses are generated against those antigens. DNA vaccination is an appealing
approach for delivering universal influenza vaccines, however, natural immune responses to conserved influenza
antigens are typically weak and most DNA vaccines tested in humans have not elicited robust humoral immunity.
To overcome the obstacles to developing universal influenza DNA vaccines, we are using novel composite
immunogens and delivering them with a next generation Gene Gun device that combines several engineering
and formulation innovations that increase immunogenicity by increasing the number of skin cells and antigen
presenting cells expressing vaccine antigen. We have already obtained encouraging results with a universal
influenza A (UFluA) DNA vaccine. Under this SBIR proposal, we intend to test a companion universal influenza
B (UFluB) DNA vaccine to create a more comprehensive universal A/B vaccine (UFluA/B) that will provide broad
protective coverage from all influenza A and B types capable of infecting humans. If we are successful at
demonstrating that a single UFluA/B DNA vaccine can induce broad responses and protection in mice in the
phase I effort, we will advance this this product to preclinical testing under the phase II portion of this application
where we will investigate immunogenicity and protective efficacy in naïve and pre-immune ferrets and safety and
efficacy in a nonhuman primate model that closely resembles humans in their dosing, immune response to DNA
vaccination and susceptibility to influenza. If successful, these data will provide Orlance with a strong preclinical
IND data package to advance this strategy to phase I human clinical trials. 2"

We will extend an active NIA cohort study of diverse, middle age and older adults with ≥1 chronic
conditions to assess COVID-19’s long-term and disparate impact on health and healthcare experiences.
 COVID-19 has become an unprecedented public health threat in modern times, especially for older adults
with a chronic illness. As of January 2021, 94% of COVID deaths have been among adults over 55; 92% of those
who have died had ≥1 underlying health conditions. Beyond consequences to personal health associated with
acquiring COVID-19, the impact of the pandemic may likely extend to non-COVID-19 outcomes as a patient’s
ability to self-manage chronic conditions during and after a pandemic may be compromised for several reasons.
 In March 2020, our team rapidly launched the COVID-19 & Chronic Conditions (C3) study as cases of
COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. to assess how adults with ≥1 chronic conditions were responding to the
pandemic. Five active studies with uniform data collection on a range of patient-reported outcomes prior to
COVID-19 and with electronic health records access were leveraged to establish the C3 cohort; 673 adults in
Chicago were interviewed during the 1st week of the outbreak. The cohort was immediately expanded using two
of the ‘parent studies’ that also had sites in New York City (n=200; N=873). C3 participants are diverse by
socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, health literacy, and comorbidity. An NIA COVID-19 supplement
was awarded in August 2020 to expand the cohort via the parent studies (N=1200) and continue data collection
up to 2022; 5 of 7 planned survey waves have been completed (83-94% retention). C3 findings reveal many
adults exhibit sustained, high stress due to COVID-19 that impacts lifestyle, treatment adherence, and healthcare
use. Disparities by sex, race, ethnicity, and SES also are present. Health professionals and researchers are now
voicing concern for possible long-term consequences of COVID-19 on personal health & healthcare.
 In response, we propose to continue to follow the C3 cohort to capture data 5 years post onset of the U.S.
outbreak. All participants will have a ‘Pre-COVID’ baseline and 7+ follow-up assessments to assess trajectories
in health care use, patient-reported & chronic disease outcomes. Our primary aims are to: 1) evaluate changes
in lifestyle, health behaviors, healthcare use, health status, and chronic disease outcomes from a pre-pandemic
baseline through 5 years after onset of COVID-19; 2) determine the extent to which stress, anxiety, and
depression contribute to poor health status and chronic disease outcomes through 5 years after the pandemic’s
onset. Our secondary aim is to: 3) identify factors that mediate or moderate associations between stress,
anxiety, and depression during/after the pandemic with health status and chronic disease outcomes, while our

 HDPTP Abstract
The NJ/NY Hazardous Materials Worker Training Center has a long history of effective training that meets the requirements
of OSHA 29CFR1910.120, providing hazardous materials knowledge and skills to over 450,000 workers since 1987. Our
Center will train workers about safety issues during emergencies and disasters. Our Center has effectively trained workers and
volunteers to respond safely to disasters including Ebola, Hurricanes, and other national disasters. The courses develop
competency in workers to critically analyze dangerous situations, and enable them to identify safe work practices. Key
principles of adult education are incorporated into our training, and training courses are developed to include peer-learning,
hands-on activities, and development of critical thinking skills. The Center has a robust evaluation plan, and will continue to
expand the types of data collected on the impact of training on workplace practice, as well as how training can more effectively
influence workplace safety culture. The Center proposes to expand our efforts in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands by
adding the Migrant Clinicians Network (PR) and working with community based organizations in the USVI.
The HDPT program enhances the safety and health of current hazardous materials workers and chemical responders by
delivering training to workers responding to disasters. These courses focus on prevention and preparedness so that disaster
response personnel are aware of safety and health hazards and mitigation techniques before they initiate a disaster response.
Over the next five years, the Center proposes to train 9,060 workers in 1,120 courses resulting in 71,905 contact hours in the
HDPTP."
10848231,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Structural Circuits Core
Modern tissue clearing and imaging methods provide the potential for a wealth of information regarding nervous
system anatomy and function. However, to best utilize such methods, understanding the options for tissue
clearing, and the advantages and disadvantages of various imaging methods need to be appreciated.
Furthermore, data handling, analysis, and storage all provide significant obstacles when attempting to make full
use of the capabilities of these modern techniques.
The goal of the Structural Circuits Core (SCC) is to help researchers best utilize ultramodern technology for the
anatomical mapping of brain circuitry involved in drug addiction. In order to do so, the SCC partners with the
University Imaging Center (UIC), the University of Minnesota Informatics Institute (UMII), the Minnesota
Supercomputing Institute (SCI) and the Data Repository for the University of Minnesota (DRUM). The SCC
provides the infrastructure for automated use of brain clearing technology paired with meso- and micro-scale
imaging of the central nervous system. Importantly, the SCC helps tailor experiments to best utilize the most
appropriate methodological and technological approaches, and, integrating with the Addiction Connectome
Core, provides standardized resources for the analysis, storage, and distribution of these imaging datasets. The
SCC not only allows investigators to quickly and thoroughly interrogate their own data, but also allows
quantitative comparisons across laboratories through a common format structure and custom designed software."

When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach.
The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map
epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or
neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal
intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care.
Over the past four years we have made substantial progress towards these goals. We have developed: (1)
robust measures derived from subdural intracranial EEG (ECOG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery;
(2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on
seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and IEEG. We also have a
track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on http: //ieeg.org, to accelerate research.

10830304,"Project Summary
The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of the few mammalian brain regions that continue to add new neurons through
adulthood. Adult neurogenesis is thought to confer advantages by improving spatial and context memory
discrimination: loss of neurogenesis impairs the ability to discriminate between similar but distinct places while
enhancing rates of neurogenesis improves this ability. Adult-born neurons, during a critical time in their
maturation when they have enhanced excitability and plasticity, are thought to improve the precision of neural
coding in the DG by making spatial representations more distinct. However, it is not yet known how adult-born
neurons affect the activity of the DG during behavior, as in vivo recordings in this area have only recently become
possible. We hypothesize that adult neurogenesis improves spatial memory by increasing the spatial information
encoded by the DG, via local feedback networks. To test this hypothesis we will use 2-photon microscopy to
image DG neural activity in vivo in behaving mice with manipulations of neurogenesis. We aim to: 1) Determine
if depletion of adult neurogenesis or silencing of new neurons decreases the encoding of spatial information in
the DG. 2) Determine if enhancing rates of adult neurogenesis is sufficient to increase spatial information in the
DG and whether the activity of new neurons is required for these changes, and 3) determine whether
hippocampal mossy cells, which receive inputs from DG granule cells, may be a critical circuit component in the
mediation of neurogenesis-dependent changes to DG spatial information. From these experiments, we will gain
essential knowledge of the processes through which adult neurogenesis contributes to spatial memory."
10838276,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
An effective HIV-1 vaccine will be one that elicits diverse anti-viral immune responses, including broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Here, we focus on eliciting anti-CD4-binding site (CD4-BS) bnAbs, including
VRC01-class bnAbs, through a guided immunization approach with specifically designed Env-derived
immunogens. We previously reported on the design of a clade C Env-derived immunogen that activates naïve
B cells expressing the bnAb precursors of VRC01-class antibodies in vivo. We also reported on the design of a
second immunogen, derived from a clade B Env, that when administered as a 1st boost, increases the
maturation of the emerging VRC01 B cells. Our proposal is based on our recent identification of two additional
Env immunogens that complete the maturation of VRC01-class antibody responses towards their cross-
neutralizing forms. Thus, after 4 Env immunizations of knock-in mice expressing elements of human VRC01
BCRs, we isolate VRC01-class antibodies that neutralize ~33% of heterologous tier 2 viruses. Here, our efforts
focus on optimizing this immunization schema to improve the neutralizing breadth of the elicited VRC01-class
antibodies. An important aspect of our proposal is that we will not limit our work to well-controlled knock-in
mice, but transgenic mice that express diverse human VH/VL genes, as well. Because the B cell repertoire of
these mice better reflects that of humans, we expect that our optimized immunization schema will not only lead
to the generation of VRC01-class antibodies, as it does in the knock-in mice, but that additional classes of anti-
CD4-BS antibody responses will also be elicited. A second important aspect of our proposal is that we will
examine whether mRNA-based immunogen-delivery platforms accelerate the development of cross-
neutralizing CD4-BS antibody responses."

Reproductive health is the window to overall health and offers enormous opportunities and challenges for high-
quality interdisciplinary research and careers. The goal of this renewal is to continue the efforts of the Career
Training in Reproductive Biology (CTRB) Program to train exceptional predoctoral students for diverse
scientific careers in the reproductive sciences. Funds are requested to train four predoctoral students per year
in a dual program consisting of two main parts. First, to prepare for a research career, students will engage in
rigorous, hypothesis-based scientific laboratory work in reproductive biology. Second, to prepare students for
varied career paths, they will complete a University of Michigan-sponsored Certificate program or other
structured career development activities to hone skills in teaching, translational research, public policy,
biotechnology, entrepreneurship, biotechnology or other areas of their choosing. These career development
programs were specifically designed to dovetail with graduate work to prepare students with the qualitative and
quantitative skills needed for careers in specific disciplines. This innovative program addresses the needs of
reproductive biology trainees in a way unlike any other program at the University of Michigan. Ten select
faculty mentors, who are highly-recognized scientists with a passion for and extensive combined experience in
predoctoral education, enthusiastically comprise the CTRB Program faculty. Trainees are drawn from
exceptionally strong graduate programs in biomedical sciences, biomedical engineering and environmental
health sciences. Specific training activities include formal courses (Mammalian Reproductive Physiology,
statistical analyses/experimental design, Responsible Conduct of Research, Rigor and Reproducibility),
participation in a structured mentoring workshop with their preceptor, scientific communication and
grantsmanship training, monthly mentored trainee research presentations, group discussions of laboratory
management, two annual symposia in reproductive sciences and yearly meeting with the Executive
Committee. Trainee input has and will continue to actively shape the training program, including via
anonymous surveys. Trainees and mentors submit formal competitive applications that are reviewed and
required for appointment to the CTRB Program. The CTRB Program is monitored through active engagement
of faculty and trainees in program development, and by an experienced internal advisory committee. These
mechanisms ensure program responsiveness to demands of a continuously-evolving research environment
and changing trainee needs."
10844020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Integrated Biological Systems Training in Oncology (IBSTO) program was established in 2008, with the
objective of providing pre-doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows with cancer-focused training that
integrates basic biological processes and translational research through understanding of the approaches
and model systems that fuel cancer discovery. The IBSTO philosophy is that future breakthroughs in the
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer will most likely be made by those individuals who are facile in
a broad suite of methodologies and approaches, who understand the importance of collaboration and cross-
disciplinary research, and who can bridge the divide between basic scientific discovery and clinical
implementation. The IBSTO program takes place in a vibrant and inclusive cancer-forward research
environment with superb resources, state-of-the-art facilities, top-ranked basic science departments, an
outstanding NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and world-class basic and translational
researchers and physician-scientists. Since its inception, we have recruited a diverse and outstanding cohort
of more than 60 pre- and post-doctoral trainees, researching in the laboratories of well-funded and productive
preceptors in a wide range of areas including cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, cancer
immunology, computational and systems biology, single cell approaches, omics, and translational cancer
research. Productivity and outcomes for IBSTO trainees—both short and long term—are superb. In this third
renewal application, we fortify our traditional areas of training strength and introduce a number of exciting and
innovative new initiatives that keep this program fresh and effective. Four pre- and four post-doctoral trainees
will spend two years each in the program, receiving a foundational training in cancer biology, sharing their
discoveries, being exposed to the latest in basic and translational cancer research, and receiving intensive
training in grant writing, scientific and lay communication, and career building. A new career series ""Cancer
Research Journeys"" will provide first-hand exposure to the interplay between scientific discovery and
professional development in the cancer realm. A new signature course ""Scientific Exposition, Ethics, and
Equity in Cancer Research"" will coach skill building through the lens of communication and interactivity, and
teach the tools, approaches, and strategies needed for an impactful career that contributes to the amelioration
of cancer. A streamlined administrative structure will keep the program nimble, and reinforce our commitment
to diversity, equity, and inclusion. And a new program co-Director will further our efforts in this regard, bring
new ideas and energy, and position IBSTO for continued success in the next period and beyond."
10849776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of obesity and associated comorbidities is a major public health concern with significant
personal and societal consequences. Weight loss pharmacotherapies that target known food intake-inhibitory
mechanisms (e.g., hindbrain and hypothalamic circuits) have been largely unsuccessful at promoting sustained
weight loss. This suggests the existence of yet-to-be-identified nodes that regulate food intake, and uncovering
such mechanisms holds promise for the development of more effective obesity treatments. To this end, we
recently used a “reverse translational” approach to identify and characterize a novel population of cerebellar
neurons and their importance to feeding behavior. Starting with human subjects and following up with
mechanistic experiments in mice, we discovered that glutamatergic neurons in the anterior, lateral deep
cerebellar nuclei (aDCN-lat) are activated by food and have the ability to dramatically reduce meal size. These
data demonstrate that glutamatergic aDCN-lat neurons are critical regulators of feeding behavior, and highlight
this population as a potential target for obesity therapeutics. Here, we leverage these findings to understand
how activity in these cerebellar neurons is regulated and how it is altered in obesity. The goals of this proposal
are to (1) reveal the sensory, nutritive, and gut-brain pathways that activate cerebellar satiation neurons, (2)
determine how activity in these neurons changes in obesity, and (3) test whether chronic activity in these
neurons is sufficient to prevent or reverse diet-induced obesity in mice. These results will provide a
comprehensive understanding of cerebellar mechanisms for feeding behavior, illuminating a novel satiation
center in the brain that may be targeted for the development obesity therapeutics."
10900621,"In response to RFA-RM-18-031, we will establish a “Data Center for Acute to Chronic

Administrative Core (AC). The AC will be led by the Principal Investigators, Martin
Lindquist and Tor Wager, with support from a steering committee consisting of the
leadership of the various components of the Center and external consultants with
significant experience with leading large-scale multisite projects. The AC will oversee
and manage the Center components, including fiscal management; personnel
management; scheduling and organization of meetings; and maintenance of resources.
The AC will also be responsible for facilitating communication and interaction between
the components of the Center, as well as with the Clinical Coordinating Center, Multisite
Clinical Centers, Omics Data Generating Centers, and NIH staff. It will: (1) reduce
administrative barriers across the A2CPS consortium by providing management
resources; (2) facilitate presentation of consortium results to the broader scientific
community; (3) serve as a central hub for organizing recurring A2CPS consortium
meetings, including both face-to-face and virtual meetings; (4) provide regular

and data usage statistics, both to the NIH and to other members of the A2CPS
consortium; and (5) maintain access to the necessary infrastructure for accomplishing
the specific aims of Center, including research, collaboration, and dissemination.
Overall, the AC will promote a stimulating intellectual environment to knit researchers
involved in A2CPS activities into a strong interdisciplinary community."

As we age, our organs experience molecular and physiological damage that prevents them from functioning
properly, which ultimately leads to disease. In the case of the heart, age-associated dysfunction causes the top
killing and most expensive diseases to treat worldwide. Over the years, it has been established that cardiac
dysfunction is largely dependent on the interaction between the exposome and genetics; however, accumulating
evidence indicates that aging in distant organs such as the lung, muscle, and kidneys can also accelerate heart
age. In this proposal, we will use deep learning and deep phenotyping data from large longitudinal cohorts (BLSA,
UK Biobank) to generate sex-specific clinical-based estimators of the biological age of different organs and
define the complete network of organs that affect each other’s aging across populations in different sexes. A
mechanism that is known to drive age-related dysfunction in the heart is the accumulation of senescent cells,
which are growth-arrested cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and
proteases known as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). SASP proteins can induce
senescence in healthy cells, and their components have been shown to increase with age in the blood,
suggesting that they could mediate the propagation of aging between organs. In fact, experiments in animal
models indicate that induction of cellular senescence in an organ, via transplantation or genetics, induces cellular
senescence in distant organs. Using blood multi-omics data from individuals with clinical-based estimations of
age in different organs and non-linear machine learning methods, we will generate an atlas of the SASP-linked
blood biomarkers associated with biological age in different organs. By performing interventional studies in
human-derived heart organoids combined with high-throughput functional electrophysiological and imaging
analysis and multi-omics, we will study the causal effects of SASP-associated proteins on cardiac function. This
will indicate the SASP-associated molecules secreted by each organ that impact cardiac health and enable the
discovery of new targets to ameliorate heart-related diseases. Finally, we will apply our novel signature-based
drug repurposing method (GCEA) to identify compounds that reverse the molecular changes induced by multiple
SASP-associated proteins in the heart. We will study in mice the effect of these compounds on maintaining
cardiac function during aging and the molecular mechanisms involved using multi-omics. The experimentally
validated compounds will hold great potential to slow down and reverse the aging process in the heart and delay
the onset of cardiovascular diseases."
10832023,"Abstract
The most common known genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) is a G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9orf72 gene. This repeat undergoes
a non-canonical form of protein translation initiation known as repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation
(RANT). RANT initiates from non-AUG codons and in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD (C9ALS/FTD) produces
dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) that aggregate within inclusions in patient brains. DPR expression separate
from potentially toxic repeat-containing RNA species is sufficient to induce cell death and reduce cell viability in
many model systems, including primary mammalian neurons. As such, RANT is thought to contribute to
disease pathogenesis. Despite this central importance, the exact endogenous repeat-containing transcripts
from which DPRs are translated remains unknown. The repeat is located within the first intron and typically,
introns are spliced from pre-mRNA as RNA lariats and rapidly degraded. In C9ALS/FTD, repeat RNAs are
observed in the cytoplasm and undergo translation. Initial studies suggested that RANT could occur from a
linear mRNA in which the repeat-containing intron is retained or via internal ribosomal entry from a C9orf72
lariat that fails to undergo degradation. However, our group recently identified a third potential source template
for C9RANT: repeat triggered transcriptional initiation within the first intron itself that generates capped repeat
containing mRNAs. This proposal will determine the RNA templates that undergo C9RANT in patient neurons
and whether targeting pathways which influence their production and stability are capable of modulating RANT
production and suppressing toxicity in C9ALS/FTD patient-derived iNeurons. Using patient-derived neurons, I
will determine the molecular nature of repeat containing C9orf72 transcripts that undergo RANT using
polysome profiling, qRT-PCR, and hybridization chain reaction coupled with confocal microscopy and
biochemical assays. In parallel, I will develop antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively target this
novel C9orf72 transcript and determine the impact of modulating C9orf72 splicing and RNA species production
on C9RANT generation and repeat toxicity. The training described in this proposal will prepare me to work at
the interface between cellular and molecular neurobiology and its application towards patient-oriented
therapeutics."
10832025,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for the noninvasive, real-time visualization of biological structures and with refined approaches, the assessment of their associated functions and physiological and pathophysiological processes. While providing intriguing opportunities to probe placenta health across gestation, it is not routinely used in pregnant women due to fetal safety concerns. However, the powerful biological potential of these approaches can be applied to experimental animal models, and for the maternal- fetal interface, the nonhuman primate is the most compelling parallel to the human from a histological, endocrine and immunological perspective. We have optimized the sequences and determined the limitations for imaging the pregnant macaque uterus and maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in previous studies, and validated dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) for assessing flow and perfusion in the placental intervillous space. In this grant we will apply our established MRI approaches to novel physiological stressors generating inflammation or dysfunction at the MFI and determine their feasibility as experimental tools in NHPs for assessing, in real time in vivo, perfusion, oxygenation, and progression to fetal growth restriction (FGR) in two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1. To utilize a physiological stimulator of macrophage trafficking, MCP1, to define the utility of MRI in detecting inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface and its potential to develop an NHP model of FGR. Specific Aim 2. To use a hemostatic agent injected into the MFI to create vascular pathology, triggering inflammation and villous ischemic injury to define the utility of MRI to identify inflammation associated with vascular pathology at the MFI, and the potential for this insult to develop an NHP model of FGR. In these studies blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI will define tissue oxygenation and ferumoxytol DCE MRI will assess noninvasively changes in the populations of phagocytic cells retaining contrast agent at the MFI, to be associated with intervillous perfusion, oxygenation, histopathology, and cellular and molecular immune responses that we predict will ultimately manifest by the development of FGR in the macaque. At UW-Madison we have developed ferumoxytol imaging in the pregnant rhesus monkey to evaluate placental perfusion and translated this approach to the clinic in our current Human Placenta Project U01 grant with an approved IRB Human Subject study. Assessment of placental hypoperfusion lesions with DCE validated by confirmation of an adjacent villous hypo-oxygenated state and placental histopathology and immunopathology, will advance clinical care by dramatically improving the accuracy of diagnosis of FGR and enhancing our ability to identify fetuses at greatest risk for consequences of significant hypoxemia."
10832026,"PROJECT SUMMARY
First-line chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). While
short-term response is achievable, most patients succumb to recurrence due to metastasis. Micrometastasis
encompasses a small population of dormant disseminated tumor cells (dDTCs) that survive in
quiescent/senescent states prior to initiating their ‘explosive’ metastatic outgrowth. Standard chemotherapy is
completely ineffective against the slow-dividing dDTCs. In contrast, cancer immunotherapy is based on the
premise of immune-recognition and targeted killing of tumor cells, thus possess the promising power to control
dormant metastatic cancer cells. However, one major hurdle in immunotherapy is to overcome the profound
immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME is associated with the accumulation of
dysfunctional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). An effective approach to alter TME is to reprogram these
inhibitory APCs into properly activated APCs that stimulate tumor antigen-specific T cells. We designed an
immuno-stimulatory nanoparticle that exploits the unique physiological features of metastatic TME, which
allows the systemic delivery of nanoparticles to achieve a robust immunostimulation within the TME. First, to
drive a sustainable antitumor immune response, we harness two synergistic innate immune pathways by co-
delivering two immune agonists. The immuno-NP is co-loaded with an agonist of the Stimulator of Interferon
Genes (STING) pathway and a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, which synergize to produce high levels of
Type I interferon (IFN) β. The dual-agonist NP guarantees uptake of both agonists by the same APC, which
elicits functional synergy. Second, the immuno-NP facilitates proficient presentation of each agonist to the
appropriate intracellular location of APCs. Third, the immuno-NP is designed for systemic administration
targeting the APC-rich perivascular areas of metastasis, leading to uptake predominantly by APC cells. As a
result, high levels of IFNβ produced within the tumor site lead to the activation of APC and NK cells that
consequently drive the recruitment of additional immune cells as well as the activation of tumor-reactive
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Any immuno-NP-associated toxicity was minimal and reversible. Our central
hypothesis is that the dual-agonist cargo (STING and TLR4 agonists) of the immuno-NP targeted to the
perivascular regions of metastasis will produce a strong IFNβ-driven antitumor immune response.
Aim 1: Optimize an immuno-NP design that targets the metastatic TME with high efficiency and mediates co-
delivery of the dual-agonist cargo at the ratio of STING/TLR4 agonists for optimal functional synergy.
Aim 2: Evaluate the short and long-term safety profile of the immuno-NP and characterize the mechanism of
antitumor immune responses associated with dosage and frequency of immuno-NP administration.
Aim 3: Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the immuno-NP as a monotherapy and in combination with immune
checkpoint inhibitors in murine models of metastatic TNBC."

We propose to design and pilot-test a technology-based, multicomponent behavioral health intervention for JIY.
The design and functionality of the mobile health intervention is grounded in two pivotal developmental
frameworks. First, the intervention will address the well-established bidirectional relationship between substance
use (SU) and co-occurring problems (CP), a defining characteristic of JJS-involved youth (JIY). Second, in
keeping with contemporary patient- and youth-centered health care delivery models, the mobile health
intervention will have an interactive design permitting youth to receive feedback and make active choices about
the care they receive. This youth-centered approach is a clear departure from traditional JJS service models.
These conceptually informed design features and functionalities will optimize youth engagement, empowerment,
and agency in order to maximize clinical outcomes. A digital health resource scalable to any smart phone would
avert the need for delivery by highly trained professionals, and could be easily accessed across the JJS, including
rural settings. The goal of the proposed Stage 1a/1b Treatment Development research is to refine and pilot test
“ePACE” (eHealth Personalized Approach for Change Efficacy), designed as a JJS- and JIY-friendly
personalized, youth-centered, mobile health resource. ePACE is composed of a multi-problem screener to guide
the implementation of a set of key integrated behavior change modules (Drug Abuse, Interpersonal Relations,
Negative Emotions, Stress) providing a cohesive focus on SU and CPs. The specific aims of are: Aim 1: Finalize
ePACE development by: 1) Conducting separate focus groups with JJS staff and JIY to seek input on the
functionality, feasibility, and initial acceptability of the resource’s screening tool and initial version of the behavior
change modules, and 2) Revise program features based on focus group results and new research literature. Aim
2: Evaluate the impact of ePACE and a “fixed” non-personalized version (eFACE) counterpart for JIY with co-
occurring problems, relative to a waiting list group (WLG) on SU and CP outcomes. We expect better SU and
CP outcomes for both ePACE and eFACE vs WLG over the 6-month follow-up and expect that ePACE vs WLG
effects will be larger than eFACE vs WLG effects. Aim 3: Evaluate the direct effects of ePACE and eFACE on
targeted areas of functioning and skill development hypothesized to produce change in SU and CP. We expect
youth assigned to ePACE and eFACE to exhibit greater improvements compared to those assigned to WLG,
with the effects of ePACE larger than those of eFACE. Aim 4: Examine factors associated with
successful implementation of ePACE, including participant ratings of usability, acceptability, and satisfaction.
The proposed brief, personalized, youth-centered, early intervention approach, web and smart-phone friendly,
offers a promising solution for the JJS to address the underserved needs of youth, potentially mitigating the need
for more intensive, costly interventions later and potentially accommodating a youth-serving system that often
lacks accessible and affordable behavior health services."
10832030,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in the U.S. has nearly doubled over the past two
decades. Liver transplant (LT) is the only life-saving option for ESLD and is projected to increase 23% by 2040.
LT requires considerable healthcare resources, costing the U.S. health system $26.7 billion annually. It is
increasingly performed among older adults; from 2006 to 2018, adults 65 and older were the most rapidly growing
age group on transplant waitlists. By 2019, 70% of LTRs were adults 50 and older. With advances in
immunosuppression (IS) and surgical techniques, average 5-year post-LT survival now exceeds 70%. However,
maintaining optimal, long-term liver graft function and overall health are contingent upon proper adherence to
prescribed treatment. This can be difficult, as liver transplant recipients (LTRs) contend with high regimen
complexity, taking on average 11 new medications that have side effects and require frequent dosage changes.
Many LTRs have lingering cognitive impairments due to pre-transplant hepatic encephalopathy, or other
psychosocial, financial, or cultural factors that all can affect the ability to adhere to treatment. As a result, a third
of LTRs demonstrate inadequate adherence to IS regimens. Poor adherence is a leading cause of liver graft
rejection, liver failure, poorly controlled medical comorbidities and subsequent mortality. Similarly, inadequate
medication knowledge and unintentional misuse are associated with post-transplant hospitalizations. Despite
the negative and costly consequences of inadequate adherence, very few prospective interventions have been
developed and tested to optimize medication-taking behaviors and subsequent outcomes post-LT. However,
there are unique considerations within the context of LT that can be leveraged by interventions: 1) LTRs remain
indefinitely connected to transplant centers for follow-up with a range of available resources; nurse coordinators,
pharmacists, psychological and social services; 2) to be eligible for LT, patients must have involved caregivers
to provide post-LT support (yet no interventions to date have involved caregivers). Our primary aim is to test the
effectiveness of a technology-enabled intervention (TEST trial) to improve treatment adherence and optimize
patient-centered and clinical outcomes among a cohort of 360 de novo LTRs at 3 diverse transplant programs
in Philadelphia, PA, Chicago, IL, and Miami, FL. Our intervention leverages existing transplant center resources,
caregiver support, and widely available patient-centered mobile health tools to remotely monitor LTRs'
adherence behaviors, `phenotype' adherence concerns, and tailor transplant center responses to those
concerns. We additionally plan to assess intervention fidelity, enabling us to evaluate patient, caregiver, provider
and health-system barriers to optimal implementation to enhance scalability. Finally, we will determine the costs
and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a transplant center and healthcare sector perspective. The TEST
trial will enable the timely identification of the presence and nature of LTR adherence barriers and mobilize
transplant centers and caregivers to deploy tailored solutions by leveraging existing resources to optimize health."
10857449,"Increased prevalence of obesity in the US population continues to drive greater risk for developing type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Excessive caloric intake stresses adipocytes into storing lipid in an
unhealthy manner, directing lipid into existing adipocytes, known as adipocyte hypertrophy. On the other hand,
healthy adipose tissue expansion and remodeling occurs when adipose tissue precursor cells (PC) in the stromal
vascular fraction (SVF) differentiate to create new pre-adipocytes which store lipid, called hyperplasia. Single
cell sequencing of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has identified two main types of PCs in the SVF, one called
adipocyte precursor cells (APCs), while the other is a fibroinflammatory adipocyte progenitors (FAPs). As their
names implies APC are pre-adipocytes which given the proper signals, differentiate into mature adipocytes, while
FAPs, can secrete cytokines inhibiting APC differentiation and initiating inflammation. Also influencing APC and
FAP lineage in the SVF are the transforming growth factor beta (TGFb)-like signaling pathways which inhibit
adipogenesis, while bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-like signaling promotes adipogenesis. Overall, little is
known about how signaling through these pathways alters the fate of APCs and FAPs especially during increased
lipoprotein flux resulting from a high fat diet (HFD). Recently we discovered that both VAT PCs, APCs and FAPs
express high levels of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, procollagen endopeptidase enhancer protein 2
(Pcpe2, gene Pcolce2) whose expression decreases as APCs become committed adipocytes. We found that
Pcpe2 is significantly upregulated (>2-fold by HFD feeding) suggesting that Pcpe2 may play a role in TGFb-like
signaling pathways in VAT PCs. Thus, the study of how Pcpe2 expression impacts TGFb /BMP-like signaling
pathways within VAT PCs represents a major knowledge gap in our understanding of how PCs respond during
HFD induced adipose tissue expansion and remodeling. Based on our preliminary data and previous Pcpe2
studies in mature adipocytes from global Pcpe2 knockout mice, we hypothesize that PC-Pcpe2
expression stimulates TGFb-like and/or suppressing BMP-like signaling pathways in VAT resulting in
fibroinflammatory, hypertrophic adipose tissue and thus, unhealthy adipose expansion. To test our
hypothesis, we will carry out two aims; Aim 1: Elucidate the mechanism by which Pcpe2’s regulates TGFb and
BMP-like signaling using PC-specific Pcpe2-hemagglutinin tagged (HA) over-expressor (ox) (PC-PcpeoxHA) and
PC cell-specific Pcpe2 knockout (KO) (PC-Pcpe2KO) mice lines. Preliminary studies show PC-Pcpe2KO mice
have reduced (~35-40%) body and VAT weight, while PC-PcpeoxHA mice showed an increase (~40-45%) in body
and VAT weight, characterized by hypertrophic adipocytes. Aim 2 Investigate Pcpce2’s structure-function
relationship based on its newly identified mucin-like O-linked glycoprotein linker domain and examine its ECM
localization and function in TGFb-like signaling. Successful completion of these integrated but independent aims
will reveal novel mechanistic insight into the dysfunctional fat storage, Pcpe2, lipoprotein metabolism and CVD."

Lung transplantation (LT) is the only definitive therapy for many patients with end-stage lung diseases, but many
LT recipients experience allograft failure with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that early detection
of allograft rejection can change their prognosis by optimizing therapies before irreversible damage occurs.
Unfortunately, we do not have good diagnostic methods to address this need. In this proposal, we plan to develop
new diagnostic and guidance tools to address this deficiency using Hyperpolarized Gas MRI (HGMRI). Our
group has reported that HGMRI can detect and endotype regional abnormalities occurring in several lung
diseases with high definition and resolution, including lung transplants. We anticipate that incorporating HGMRI
signatures into the standard clinical workflow will significantly increase the detection rate of acute cellular
rejection (ACR) in asymptomatic LT recipients. Herein, our aims will test the performance of our HGMRI
signatures to enhance the detection and endotyping of ACR. Three sub-aims of Aim 1 are; (1) Aim 1a -
correlating the results of the tissue pathology (current clinical gold standard) with HGMRI signatures; (2) Aim 1b
- determining the HGMRI signature responses before and after ACR treatment; and (3) Aim 1c - determining
the correlation between HGMRI signatures and single-cell RNA-sequence (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic
signatures, showing dysregulated host immune responses. Two sub-aims of Aim 2 are; (1) Aim 2a – determining
if the regional ACR diagnosis by HGMRI signatures and tissue pathology persists from Visit 1 at baseline (Aim
1) to Visit 2 at 12-month follow-up (Aim 2); and (2) Aim 2b - determining additional correlations at 12 months
between the HGMRI and scRNA-seq signatures and test if HGMRI signatures reflect underpinning
immunopathology in LT recipients with rejection. Successful completion of this proposal will ready HGMRI
signatures with which ACR can be detected early, followed noninvasively, and corroborated by the state-of-the-
art scRNA-seq transcriptomic signatures. Our proposal will test the performance of HGMRI signatures by
independent but corroborating approaches to maintain scientific rigor with the potential to advance the field of
pulmonary transplant medicine."

Intrauterine infection/inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor and fetal inflammation leading to
injury responses in fetal organs such as the brain, lung and the GI tract. However, the mechanisms and precise
therapeutic approaches remain elusive largely because of lack of relevant animal models. We have developed
a powerful new model of intrauterine infection in preterm Rhesus macaques: Intraamniotic (IA) injection of live
E. coli followed 24h later with antibiotics. This model results in persistent IUI. Importantly, the maternal and fetal
inflammation persists despite clearance of E. coli bacteremia, resulting in preterm labor (PTL), fetal immune
aberrations and fetal neuroinflammation. After an expert FDA panel recommended withdrawal, the only drug
approved drug for preterm labor, 17-hydroxy progesterone caproate (17-HPC) was withdrawn from the market
by its manufacturer in 2023. Our data suggests that a major reason for failure of 17-HPC is that progesterone is
inactivated intracellularly by an enzyme encoded by the gene AKR1C1. We further demonstrated that IUI induces
AKR1C1 expression both in the Rhesus macaque uterus and choriodecidua. We therefore propose using a novel
synthetic progestin R5020 that is resistant to AKR1C1 mediated inactivation. R5020 is already in clinical use in
some European countries for menopausal therapy and certain gynecological disorders. The grant is based on
the premise that drug repurposing of a novel progestin with favorable pharmacological properties of enhanced
affinity for the progesterone receptor and resistance to AKR1C1 inactivation will be an effective therapeutic
strategy. We propose to test the hypothesis that R5020 will reduce the residual maternal and fetal inflammation
in infectious models that closely simulate IUI in pregnant women with two Aims. In Aim 1, we will test if R5020
will decrease IUI induced inflammation and preterm labor. We will use state-of-the-art single-nucleus
transcriptomic approach and inflammatory marker discovery science to unravel cellular and molecular
mechanisms of inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, and define labor associated pathways of IUI. Using
multi-parameter flow cytometry, we will identify mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment and activation in the
chorio-decidua. In Aim 2, We will identify systemic fetal immune perturbations resulting from IUI. We will
determine if R5020 can reduce fetal systemic inflammation. We will uncover mechanisms of neuroinflammation
resulting from IUI by single nucleus RNA seq and multi-parameter immunohistology. These studies will develop
the critical knowledge base for future studies aimed at repurposing of R5020 as a novel preterm labor
preventative therapy for human IUI. A collaborative multi-disciplinary team will use high-resolution immunology,
genomics/proteomics, neuro-science, and translational approaches in modeling IUI and fetal inflammation in an
animal model that closely mimics the human pathology."
10834080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal obesity and excess weight gain in pregnancy are the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity.
Randomized trials in women with obesity have shown that lifestyle interventions in pregnancy produce modest
reductions in gestational weight gain, yet unfortunately fail to produce clinically significant improvements in
maternal and child outcomes as long hoped. Several well-defined prospective cohort studies suggest that for
women with obesity, weight maintenance during pregnancy – and specifically loss in fat mass – may be
required to reduce adverse maternal and child outcomes. However, there are no randomized controlled trials
testing the health effects of weight maintenance and significant maternal fat mass loss during pregnancy in
women with obesity. Our novel preliminary energy balance and body composition data showed that weight
maintenance during pregnancy could be achieved with careful timing of caloric restriction during the second
trimester and eucaloric goals during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Based on these and our other preliminary
data, we propose a highly rigorous proof-of-principle trial to determine the effects of a 6-month gestational
intervention with calorie restriction and food provision to promote maternal weight maintenance and fat loss in
women with grades 2 and 3 obesity. Pregnant women with grades 2 and 3 obesity (N = 100; 30% Hispanic;
30% Black) will be randomized to usual care or a gestational fat mass loss (FML) intervention. The principal
aims are to determine the effects of FML during pregnancy on changes in 1) maternal weight, fat mass, and
cardiometabolic risk factors; and, 2) safety measures, including fetal and neonatal growth. All women will be
assessed at baseline (13-16 weeks), 27-29 weeks, and 35-37 weeks gestation and at 2 weeks postpartum;
safety measures are collected every 4 weeks throughout the trial. This project is significant because findings
have the potential to set the stage for a revision in national recommendations that currently encourage weight
gain during pregnancy in women with severe obesity; findings may lead to new guidelines that encourage
practitioners to not delay intensive weight management treatment in women with obesity who become
pregnant and present for healthcare. The study is also innovative; there have been no randomized controlled
trials evaluating the effects of a an intervention intensive enough to actually achieve weight maintenance
during pregnancy and provide much needed safety and efficacy data to inform practice recommendations for
diverse women with severe obesity who lack effective treatment options."
10834083,"Habituation is a simple form of learning in which animals reduce responsiveness to repetitive stimuli. Habituation forms a foundation for normal cognition; without the ability to filter irrelevant stimuli, animals are unable to perform more complex cognitive tasks. Indeed, habituation learning is impaired in a wide range of heritable human disorders that present with more complex cognitive symptoms, including Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorders and Huntington’s Disease. Habituation learning is also a significant component of our innate decision-making: habituation to particular foods or drugs of abuse influences our responses to these stimuli and our decisions to seek them. Beyond its relevance for human behavior and disease, habituation can provide a simple and accessible model for examining some of the most exciting mysteries that inspired the BRAIN initiative, such as how proteins are mobilized during learning to alter synapses, circuits and behavior. Despite great interest, decades of study, and relevance for human disease, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of habituation learning.  This proposal is based on the candidate’s discovery that post-translational palmitoylation plays a critical role in habituation learning. Specifically, using the larval zebrafish, she has found that the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 targets the Shaker-like channel Kv1.1 to regulate learning. This novel learning pathway represents an entirely independent research niche from which the PI will establish her own laboratory. The Granato lab, although expert in behavioral genetics, has never systematically examined how post-translational modifications influence protein dynamics, synapses, and behavior in real time. The PI will receive training from world experts in palmitoylation (Dr. Eric Witze) and in vivo electrophysiology (Dr. Alberto Pereda), integrating these approaches into a well-rounded system to examine learning across genes, circuits, and behavior.  The PI will be based in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Granato at the University of Pennsylvania for the entire K99 period. During this time, the PI will learn to perform electrophysiological recordings in vivo to identify how activity within individual neurons is dynamic during habituation learning, and how plasticity is disrupted in mutants lacking Hip14 or Kv1.1 (Aim 1). This approach will be combined with calcium imaging, unbiased whole brain activity mapping, and transgenic rescue experiments to identify new circuit loci for habituation learning. Simultaneously, the PI will perform biochemical and live imaging experiments to examine how protein palmitoylation changes during learning, and how palmitoylation affects target protein localization in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, the PI will conduct a candidate screen to identify additional learning-relevant targets for Hip14 palmitoylation (Aim 3). These efforts will establish a broad and independent foundation for the candidate’s independent career investigating how post-translational modifications influence synaptic plasticity within defined neural circuits as we learn."
10834191,"Project Summary
Inflammatory bowel disorders represent insufficient epithelial repair and colorectal cancer (CRC), the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, reflects disruption of intestinal stem cell
(ISCs) homeostasis. ISCs depend in part on underlying mesenchymal signaling gradients that balance
proliferation versus differentiation capacity of crypt cells, including ISCs. Moreover, ISCs regenerate
efficiently after ablation, by de-differentiation of crypt cells. It is unknown which signals or mesenchymal
cells promote this regenerative process. My preliminary studies uncover three distinct mesenchymal cell
types, two of which orchestrate BMP signaling gradients. High PDGFRA- expressing cells, which
correspond to recently described telocytes, lie closest to the epithelium, are most abundant at the villus
base, and express high levels of BMP ligands. Low PDGFRA-expressing cells contain two
subpopulations: a CD81+ fraction found exclusively below crypts and expressing high levels of the BMP
antagonist Gremlin1, and a CD81- fraction (CP cells) which resides above and around crypts but lacks
Grem1. In co-cultures of isolated crypt epithelium with each of these strictly purified cell types,
CD81+PDGFRAlo cells functionally replace all growth factor-supplemented media, while CP cells do so
minimally and telocytes do not. Furthermore, ablation of Grem1+ cells in vivo results in loss of ISCs,
hence I call these cells trophocytes. How each of these distinct mesenchymal cell populations regulates
fetal ISC plasticity during development and ISC regeneration during loss, is unknown. I hypothesize that
telocyte, CP, and trophocyte functions evolve during development, leading to genesis of a stable crypt-
villus niche and that some of the same populations promote crypt regeneration after ISC ablation. In
Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular profiles and functions of telocytes, CP cells, and
trophocytes during mouse fetal ISC development. I will determine when these cells arise during
development, investigate their full transcriptional profiles, and use an established crypt co-culture
method to define their supportive roles. In Aim 2, I will test how these mesenchymal cells respond
to ISC loss and promote crypt regeneration. Using in vivo assays of ISC regeneration, combined
with bulk and single-cell RNAseq and in vivo genetic knockouts, I will test which cells promote ISC
regeneration and specifically if this occurs through supraphysiologic BMP inhibition. Collectively, these
studies will provide fundamental insights into the development and regulation of ISCs in fetal
development and regeneration, with broad implications for intestinal biology and disease."
10834245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human genome is regulated through interactions between DNA and proteins in the nucleus that define and
maintain the epigenetic state of cells. Therefore, large consortia such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE) are dedicated to comprehensively mapping regulatory elements such as transcription factor binding
or histone modification so that we may understand regulatory processes that guide development, disease, and
the everyday functioning of cells in our body. However, current methods for genome-wide measurement of
protein-DNA interactions are unable to map regulatory elements in highly repetitive regions of the genome
because they rely on high-throughput, short-read DNA sequencing platforms. This limitation prohibits
comprehensive investigation of roughly 8% of the human genome including centromeres and ribosomal DNA
arrays, which play essential roles in chromosome segregation and nuclear organization. Furthermore, these
methods typically lack the sensitivity to profile the epigenetic landscape of single cells, preventing high-resolution
measurements of regulatory variation in complex tissues. The goal of this research program is to expand the
toolbox for mapping protein-DNA interactions genome-wide and extend capabilities to long-read sequencing and
single-cell sequencing technologies with the development of two methods: (1) Directed methylation and long-
read sequencing (DiMeLo-Seq) and (2) single-cell directed methylation and sequencing (scDiMe-Seq). To record
the genomic position of protein binding or histone modification, a methyltransferase fused to protein A will be
directed to the targeted regulatory element with a primary antibody. Upon activation, the methyltransferase will
methylate adenines in proximal DNA sequences. DiMeLo-Seq will implement long-read DNA sequencing
technologies such as nanopore sequencing to directly detect the position of these modifications on long
molecules of DNA, taking advantage of the differential signal generated by methyl-adenines as they pass through
the nanopore. This approach will produce sequencing reads of up to hundreds of kilobases long, providing high-
confidence mapping of regulatory elements to regions of the genome that are unmappable with short-read
sequencing. To detect these modifications with single-cell sensitivity, scDiMe-Seq will enrich genomic loci
containing methyl adenines through targeted digestion, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. These enriched
fragments will then be sequenced using standard high-throughput sequencing. This project aims to develop
DiMeLo-Seq and scDiMe-Seq through rigorous protocol optimization of the directed methylation strategy and
sequencing library preparation for long and short-read sequencing. The methods will then be characterized and
validated by targeting well studied features such as lamina associated domains, and CTCF landscapes, as well
as H3K9me3 and CENPA which are both enriched in centromeres. The overall goal of this project is to produce
two robust and scalable methods that may shed light on regulatory mechanism in previously unexplored regions
of the genome and aid in Human Cell Atlas initiatives by providing epigenetic information for single-cell analysis."
10928223,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Muscle atrophy resulting from physical disuse (such as post-surgery, or with extended periods of physical
inactivity) increases fall risk and disability in older adults. With a growing aging population, the dysfunctions
related to physical disuse will be widespread contributing to large-scale decreases in healthspan, and increases
in morbidities and hospitalizations as skeletal muscle health is important for whole body glucose regulation,
postural stability/balance, and strength to perform activities of daily living (independence). Unfortunately, physical
rehabilitation alone does not always adequately restore muscle size and function in older populations. The use
of mechanistic-based, translational therapeutics may provide a much-needed solution to improve muscle
recovery in older adults following disuse, however, well designed, translational pre-clinical trials testing
therapeutic agents are required. Here, in the F99 phase, I propose a rigorous pre-clinical trial utilizing a metformin
and leucine combination treatment (MET+LEU) to promote muscle recovery from disuse in aged mice. My
current progress supports that MET+LEU promotes recovery from disuse in aged mice as evidenced by
increased strength, satellite cells and reduced muscle fibrosis. Through in vitro and in vivo methods, we aim to
test the mechanism of MET+LEU action. The goal of this work is to identify if MET+LEU treatment confers
positive benefits in a skeletal muscle cell autonomous fashion, and if the effects of MET+LEU are regulated
through the SIRT1-AMPKα-PGC-1α signaling axis, implicated to be targeted by MET+LEU. During the K00
phase, I will work under an expert in muscle aging specifically in extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroblast-
satellite cell crosstalk, to further elucidate the effects of MET+LEU and other translational therapeutics on muscle
health. In doing so, we will become closer to providing a solution to promote muscle recovery following disuse
by furthering our knowledge on how MET+LEU and other translationally relevant therapies influence muscle
dysfunction with disuse and aging. Through these two critical phases and the mentoring across two exceptional
academic institutions, I will fill current gaps in my skillset using skeletal muscle cell genetic manipulation, genetic
mouse models, guidance in utilizing potential translatable pharmaceuticals in pre-clinical research, exposure to
related clinical trials, and new knowledge and techniques to investigate cell-to-cell crosstalk in aging muscle. I
will additionally gain grant writing and outreach skills to promote diversity in health-related biomedical research.
These skills gained will enhance my long-term career goal to become a tenured professor running an
independent, NIH-funding laboratory focused on novel, translatable therapeutics to promote muscle
health in aging."

10834164,"HIV-affected adolescents and young adults (AYA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experience stressors that
increase their risk for problematic alcohol use, which in turn can lead to HIV infection or transmission and poor
HIV outcomes, including linkage to care and ART adherence. Efforts to address the HIV epidemic among
adolescents and young adults in SSA have therefore focused, in part, on treating risky alcohol use. Yet, the
vast majority of HIV-affected AYA in SSA who need alcohol services do not receive them, resulting in a
substantial treatment gap. A critical barrier to the accurate screening for risky alcohol use among AYA and
provision of appropriate treatment is a lack of objective measures for alcohol consumption in HIV care settings,
which rely primarily on self-report alone. This K01 mentored research scientist development proposal aims to
examine the role of biomarkers in improving alcohol screening and treatment referral among AYA in HIV
prevention and treatment clinics. Specifically, the proposal will investigate a urine-based biomarker, ethyl
glucuronide (UEtG), which has displayed potential as a point-of-care diagnostic tool among clinic-based
populations in the U.S. but has not been investigated as a valid and feasible method within HIV care settings
among AYA. Research activities for this proposal will take place in Zambia, a country with one of the highest
HIV prevalence estimates in the world. The research will leverage over a decade of HIV research in Zambia by
Johns Hopkins University and a longstanding collaboration with Centre for Infectious Disease Research in
Zambia (CIDRZ), the local implementing partner. Specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) assess the test
characteristics of UEtG among HIV-affected AYA in Zambia; 2) develop a protocol for the use of rapid UEtG
dip card testing embedded within AYA HIV prevention and treatment; and 3) pilot the UEtG protocol developed
in Aim 2 and refine procedures with a formative evaluation process. Findings will inform implementation
strategies that can be tested in a follow-up study. The research is designed to be an integral component of a
rigorous training and career development plan focused on HIV/AIDS, alcohol biomarkers, and implementation
science. Training will take the form of coursework, lab training, and one-on-one mentorship with an
experienced and dedicated team of multidisciplinary mentors and consultants who are widely considered to be
experts in their respective fields. The goal of the professional development plan is to facilitate the candidate's
transition into an independent investigator in alcohol epidemiology and implementation science with specific
expertise in HIV and biomarkers. The proposal is directly in line with Goal 2 (“improve diagnosis and tracking of
alcohol misuse”) and Objective 5c (“facilitating dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices
for diagnosing alcohol misuse”) of the NIAAA Strategic plan 2017-2021. The proposal is consistent with NIH

“research training of the workforce required to conduct high priority HIV/AIDS or HIV/AIDS-related research.”"
10834268,"Project Summary Epilepsy affects up to 1% of the population worldwide, and 3 million in the United States
alone. A growing proportion of pediatric epilepsies are tied to causative variants in ion channel genes, including
the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A. The 2020 Epilepsy Research Benchmarks of NINDS prioritize
identifying how genetic variants cause epilepsy and related neurodevelopmental disorders. SCN2A variants that
manifest with loss-of-function are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and late-onset epilepsy.
On the other hand, gain-of-function SCN2A variants predominantly have a phenotype of early-onset epilepsy.
The encoded sodium channel (NaV1.2) is highly expressed in excitatory glutamatergic neurons early in
development, presenting a unique opportunity to examine how excitatory neuron dysfunction leads to early-onset
epilepsy. Animal and human tissue-derived neuron models have brought mechanistic insight to how Dravet
syndrome results in interneuron dysfunction and epilepsy. Among SCN2A-related diseases, animal models
illuminate how loss-of-function leads to autism spectrum disorder with late-onset epilepsy. Due to lack of readily
available disease models, there is sparse mechanistic understanding of how excitatory neuron dysfunction early
in development leads to early-onset epilepsy. This proposal will exploit two early-onset epilepsy variants of
SCN2A that have a convergent clinical phenotype yet divergent biophysical mechanisms. Patient-derived neuron
models and mouse models provide the opportunity to define the point of mechanistic convergence at multiple
scales: from single neurons to neural circuits influencing epilepsy phenotype. Aim 1 will determine how two gain-
of-function SCN2A variants, encoding missense mutations M1879T and E430A, confer increased excitability by
distinct mechanisms. Functional analysis of iPSC-derived neurons in isolation and in elementary circuits will
define how the different variants impact excitability and thus converge toward an epileptic phenotype. Aim 2 will
define hippocampal higher-level circuit perturbations in epileptic mice designed with genome editing to
recapitulate the SCN2A-E430A human epileptic encephalopathy. Ex vivo analysis of changes in excitability,
synaptic signaling, and network output in the hippocampus will lead to new understanding of how gain-of-function
SCN2A variants affect neuronal networks. EEG and depth electrodes will provide spatiotemporal correlate to the
in vivo epilepsy phenotype. This proposal will propel the awardee to independence as a physician-scientist by
incorporating new expertise in multi-scale modeling of genetic epilepsy, focused relevant didactics, and a diverse
career development team specializing in neurodevelopmental and genetic disorders, all in a highly collaborative
environment fostering junior faculty development. This award will provide a platform to 1) define variant-specific
contributions to epilepsy phenotype in self-limited and intractable epilepsies and 2) investigate how targeted
epileptic circuit dysfunction influences circuit output and epilepsy phenotype in future R01-funded independent
research."

The premise for the proposed research stems from precedence in other diseases, such as cancer,
cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and most relevant to the current proposal, autoimmune diseases, in which
extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in the pathophysiology and are important biomarkers for early detection.
However, in human type 1 diabetes (T1D), little is known concerning EVs in cellular communication. Our overall
hypothesis is that autocrine-paracrine interactions, mediated through EVs, between the islets and islet-infiltrating
immune cells in the pancreas contribute to the development and progression of T1D. Our specific aims are: 1)
to assess the functional impact of islet-infiltrating T-cell derived EVs (T-EV) from T1D and autoantibody+ (Aab+)
donors on islet health and on distinct immune cell populations; 2) to investigate the contribution of stressed or
T1D islet-derived EVs (I-EV) on immune cell phenotype and islet health; and 3) to decipher the differential protein
cargo in T-EV and I-EV from T1D and Aab+ donors. To address these aims, we have assembled a team of
investigators with highly relevant expertise, techniques and unique resources of cell lines and tissue samples.
From 36 human tissue donors with T1D or Aab positivity, we have >600 T cell lines grown directly from the
individual islets of pancreata. We have the expertise and technical ability to isolate EV from islets (I-EV) and
from islet-infiltrating T cell lines (T-EV) from T1D donors. Our preliminary data indicates I-EV and T-EV have
both paracrine and autocrine effects on islet health and immune cell phenotype. Our Research Plan is to
generate T-EV and I-EV from donors with T1D of distinct durations or positivity for islet autoantibodies, to
evaluate their effects on islet health and immune cell function, and to determine the uniquely packaged protein
cargo from these EVs whose molecular composition reflects the pathophysiologic state of the disseminating cell.
These studies will yield important information concerning the communication between immune cell populations
and islets via EVs in the pathogenesis of T1D, and potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for T1D."
10834276,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is a deadly disease ranking 5th in cancer deaths in women, with the 3rd highest mortality
to incidence ratio of all cancers. With patient overall survival not significantly changed for several decades, there
is a clear unmet clinical need to develop new therapies for OvCa. Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A enzymes
(ALDH1A) represent a therapeutic target for OvCa. ALDH1A enzymes are upregulated in ovarian cancer
initiating cells (CIC) and mediate the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA), to regulate numerous cellular
processes. We recently identified a novel ALDH1A family inhibitor (ALDHi). Our preliminary data indicate
that ALDHi treatment of cancer cells and immune cells have opposite effects, both of which could promote anti-
tumor immunity. ALDHi treatment of CIC induces an RA and transcription- dependent necroptotic cell death,
potentially related to altered function of the RA transcription partner NR4A1. This ALDHi-induced CIC death is
associated with the release of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) and other inflammatory
mediators. In contrast, ALDHi treatment is associated with enhanced proliferative response of both dendritic cells
(DC) and CD8+ T cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALDHi can act as an immune modulator and
can be used to enhance immunotherapeutic approaches in OvCa. To test our hypotheses, we propose the
following specific aims: SA1: To identify the RA receptors and downstream factors that drive ALDHi induced CIC
necrosis and to determine whether ALDHi-induced CIC necroptosis is inflammatory cell death. We propose to
test the role of individual RA receptors RAR/RXR and NR4A1 co-receptor in ALDHi-mediated CIC death and
evaluate the impact of ALDHi/NR4A1 on CIC release of inflammatory mediators and this stimulation of an anti-
tumor T cell response. Next, we will, in SA2: Assess the impact of ALDHi on host DC and T
cells. As RA can regulate the differentiation of T cells and DC, we will use reporter mice to evaluate the role
of ALDHi on disruption of RA/NR4A1 signaling and DC and T cell biology in vitro and in vivo. We will evaluate
the capacity of DC to differentiate into IL-12 producing DC1, and CD4 T helper cell subsets differentiation with
focus on the Th17/Treg trans-differentiation. Finally, our preliminary data suggest ALDHi may enhance anti-
tumor immunity both via actions on the tumor cell and immune cells. We therefore propose SA3: To determine
the ability of ALDHi to enhance immunotherapy in OvCa. To test this hypothesis, we will use several immune
competent models of OvCa to determine the ability of ALDHi to enhance checkpoint inhibitor therapy and
antitumor vaccines.
IMPACT: While immune therapy has demonstrated significant benefit in many cancers, the impact in OvCa has
been limited. The studies proposed here will define the role for a novel therapeutic ALDHi in immunotherapy in
OvCa. Given ALDH is broadly linked with therapeutic resistance in cancer, these studies will have far-reaching
implications for cancer therapy."

10831981,"This application is to extend a MERIT award to study RNA synthesis in minus-strand RNA viruses. Nonsegmented
negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses include some of the most significant human pathogens that are an ongoing threat
to US public health. For measles, mumps and rabies there are licensed vaccines, but for most NNS RNA viruses there
are no vaccines and no antiviral drugs. Our long-term objective is to understand the mechanisms by which the
replication machinery of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototype of the NNS RNA viruses, functions. VSV is the
ideal choice for such studies because it is the only NNS RNA virus for which robust transcription can be reconstituted
in vitro from purified recombinant components. The catalytic core of the RNA synthesis machinery is a 241 kDa large
protein (L) that contains an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase)
that caps the mRNA, and a dual specificity mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase). During mRNA synthesis, those
activities are coordinated so that the nascent mRNA is capped, methylated and polyadenylated. Although L contains
all the enzymatic activities for RNA synthesis, it requires a 29 kDa phosphoprotein (P) that bridges interactions
between L and the nucleocapsid protein (N) that completely coats the RNA template. Since the last competing
renewal of this grant, we have obtained an atomic model of the VSV L protein. That structure profoundly changes our
understanding of the RNA synthesis machinery of the NNS RNA viruses revealing that dynamic inter domain
rearrangements in L protein must occur during RNA synthesis, identifying an intimate linkage between capping and
RNA synthesis and identifying key P-L interactions that likely facilitate the inter domain rearrangements. Our
underlying hypothesis is that the catalytic activities of L in RNA polymerization, mRNA cap addition and cap
methylation which reside within structurally separate domains are coordinated by the presence of the P and the
template associated N to regulate their activities during mRNA synthesis, and to downregulate them during assembly
by complex formation with the viral matrix protein (M). A major gap in understanding the machinery of RNA synthesis
is the existing structures of L likely represent the pre-initiation form of the transcriptase. We have in hand an
interpretable density map of a rabies virus L-P complex from cryo EM. During the next funding period, we will continue
to use cryo electron microscopy (EM), negative-stain EM, X-ray crystallography, in vitro biochemistry of polymerase
and molecular virology to provide unique structural and functional insights into VSV and rabies virus polymerases
during distinct stages of RNA synthesis and assembly. The successful completion of this work will provide an atomic
level structure of an NNS RNA virus polymerase complex and new mechanistic insights into the function and
regulation of this RNA synthesis machine during transcription, replication and assembly. Those results may aid efforts
toward rational attenuation of NNS RNA viruses for vaccine purposes, and the development of antiviral therapeutics."

 Students in marginalized communities who `strive' to rise above adversity to achieve academic success
are considered `resilient'. However, youths' resilience in one domain (i.e. academic) can come at a cost in
other domains including physical and mental health morbidities that are under-identified and under-treated.
Previous research suggests that Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) who exhibit a “striving
persistent behavioral style” in the face of adversity evince later health morbidities. Ironically, the same self-
regulatory skills that promote academic achievement amid chronic stress can also result in physiological
dysregulation that harms health and mental health1–3. Self-regulatory processes that involve emotion
suppression, experiential avoidance, and unmodulated perseverance can culminate in allostatic load which
fuels health disparities1,4 and internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety5.
 The proposed mechanistic trial will utilize mindfulness training to permit examination of questions about
the causal role of emotion regulation strategies linked to the striving persistent behavioral style in driving
mental health and health morbidities among BIPOC78. The proposed Project STRIVE (STudents RIsing
aboVE) will identify BIPOC students who are academically resilient in the face of disadvantage and will offer a
tailored mindfulness intervention targeting self-regulation processes as a putative mechanism to interrupt the
links between the striving persistent behavioral style and negative health outcomes. We propose a multisite
randomized trial randomizing 504 high achieving, socioeconomically disadvantaged Black, Latinx and Asian
American students in 18 schools to receive a mindfulness intervention or an attention control condition focused
on study skills. The study will: (1) test the effects of the STRIVE intervention on putative self-regulation
mechanisms (emotion suppression, experiential avoidance, and unmodulated perseverance) among. (2) test
the effects of the STRIVE intervention on health and mental health outcomes at 12-month post-treatment,
including biomarkers of allostatic load (cortisol, blood pressure, body-mass-index, waist/hip/neck
circumference), health complaints, and internalizing symptoms, and (3) examine the mechanistic model linking
striving persistent behavioral style and health outcomes within the STRIVE trial. If successful, this trial will
build toward a scalable, secondary preventive intervention with potential for preventing both health and mental
health disparities among underserved BIPOC youth at the population-level."

Malaria is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and one of the biggest
impediments to the economic development. The major method for controlling these malaria-transmitting
mosquitoes is through the use of chemical insecticides but resistance has emerged and is a major threat to the
recent reductions in both deaths and malaria infections.
A major challenge facing malaria control program managers is knowing to what extent insecticide resistance is
impacting control and when to take action eg by switching to a new intervention. In the first cycle of this
award we exploited the advent of population genomic technologies to develop an improved understanding of
the evolution and distribution of insecticide resistance mechanisms. In this proposal we describe how we will
integrate this resistance marker discovery work with new functional genomic approaches and large vector
control trials to demonstrate how genomic surveillance can be used to guide vector control.
We will leverage our work on two large vector control trials in East Africa. In Uganda we embedded a cluster-
randomised control trial (RCT) of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) with, and without, the synergist PBO
into a countrywide distribution campaign. In Kenya together with KEMRI we are conducting an RCT of novel
intervention, Attractive Targeted Sugar Baits. We will use whole genome sequencing of the three major
malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and An. arabiensis from these trial sites to identify genomic
regions that are associated with insecticide resistance. We will then develop two contrasting models of the
genetics of resistance. The first that assumes that we can accurately describe the likelihood of mosquito being
insecticide resistant to by examining a small number of well characterised markers. This model capitalises on
our recent developments in CRISPR/Cas9 transformation of Anopheles. The second model uses a polygenic
score approach that requires a far larger number of markers, significantly-associated with resistance, but with
no need for an understanding of causal mechanisms.
By screening mosquito collections from the clusters within the RCTs and by, re-analysing the epidemiological
data with the inclusion of the two resistance models, we will quantify the impact of resistance on the
intervention efficacy. We will test whether the model based on a small number of genetic variants has
sufficient predictive power for resistance monitoring or whether a larger number of loci provides superior
predictive power. The former would aid widespread adoption of genetic surveillance of programmes. Finally
through two modelling approaches we will 1. deliver predictions of molecularly-defined resistance at the
administrative unit level in East Africa and 2. integrate these resistance data into transmission models of
falciparum malaria to inform decisions on what is the optimal type of vector control to deploy."
10832575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Androgen Receptor (AR) may be the earliest known example of a lineage oncogene: a master regulator of
cell survival and growth to which neoplastic cells derived from prostate epithelium are addicted. Recognizing this
unique feature, concerted efforts have focused on developing therapeutics capable of suppressing AR signaling.
Emerging strategies, mirroring successes in treatment for infectious diseases, will eventually deploy
combinations of drugs that will likely extinguish AR signaling, an event that may cure a subset of prostate
cancers. However, the plasticity of carcinomas, in part generated by highly unstable genomes, suggests that
prostate cancers are likely to emerge from this therapeutic pressure with a phenotype/genotype that is entirely
independent of AR signaling. This proposal is designed to anticipate that combinatorial AR pathway inhibition
will contribute to cell plasticity and select for subpopulations of resistant tumor cells that are completely
independent of AR signaling and do not exhibit neuroendocrine characteristics. We will test the hypothesis that
AR Pathway-Independent Prostate Cancers (APIPC) activate, and are dependent upon, a limited set of specific
survival and growth regulatory pathways that are regulated via de-repressed feedback loops and/or
genetic/epigenetic alterations in specific oncogenic networks.
Our Aims and strategies are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling promotes the
 progression of AR-dependent PC to AR-null APIPC and assess outcomes of FGF-targeted
 therapeutics. Cell lines and PDX models of disease representing a spectrum of AR-dependent
 and AR-independent lines will be evaluated.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms contributing to FGF pathway activation in APIPC. We will utilize
 relevant in vivo model systems and biospecimens to determine genomic and epigenomic
 mechanism(s) that activate FGF signaling and determine how the FGF pathway promotes
 adverse prostate cancer phenotypes.
Specific Aim 3: Identify and target mechanisms of resistance to FGF pathway inhibition and to other drivers
 of prostate cancer lineage plasticity. We will evaluate relevant model systems and human
 biospecimens for the heterogeneity and diversity of mechanisms contributing to tumor cell
 plasticity, and assess the effectiveness of therapeutics that intercept, reverse or inhibit
 emerging drivers.
In order for effective therapeutics to be developed that can adequately address this new class of malignancy,
the pathways utilized by APIPC must first be clearly defined; this project aims to elucidate those underlying
mechanisms."

Ribosomes are large ribonucleoprotein complexes that are integral to translational control. The assembly and
maturation of ribosomal subunits involves a multitude of trans-acting factors that render the subunits
translationally competent. Maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit is accomplished by the release of eukaryotic
initiation factor-6 (eIF6) with the help of the maturation factors-SBDS and EFL1-GTPase. eIF6 sterically hinders
association of the 60S and 40S subunits and therefore, its release from 60S is critical to permit interactions
between 60S and the mRNA-bound 40S subunits. In addition, eIF6 is essential for rRNA processing in the
nucleolus and is associated with the translationally stalled 60S-ribosome quality control complex. Given its
essential roles, the spatial and temporal aspects of eIF6 activities and its release from 60S must be tightly
regulated to ensure successful initiation of translation. Impaired release of eIF6 is the defining hallmark of certain
ribosomopathies: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and RPL10 mutations-driven pediatric leukemias. eIF6 levels
are also deregulated in several cancers and its enhanced expression is associated with a poor prognosis.
Remarkably, restricting eIF6 levels inhibits growth of certain cancers without affecting normal growth. Therefore,
targeting eIF6 and its release from 60S has been proposed to be a desirable therapeutic strategy for cancers
and ribosomopathies. However, we are yet to understand the role of eIF6 in modulating the distinct steps of 60S
assembly and maturation. Also, the molecular mechanisms that regulate eIF6 interactions with the 60S are not
completely understood. Towards understanding these mechanisms, our recent work has identified key residues
in critical interfaces of eIF6 that modulate its interaction with 60S, and our preliminary data provide direct
evidence that the disruption of this interaction is detrimental to cancer cell viability. We have also identified novel
sites of regulation in the C-terminus of eIF6 and have uncovered its importance for controlling translational rates.
Building on these discoveries, in the current proposal we aim to define the mechanistic steps that promote the
release of eIF6 by SBDS, and EFL1 from distinct functional states of 60S and to uncover the role of GTPase
activity of EFL1 using a rigorous set of biochemical, biophysical, and single molecule approaches. In addition,
we aim to uncover the mechanism of allosteric regulation by the C-terminus of eIF6 and elucidate the functional
and phenotypic effects of disease-specific mutations of eIF6 using cellular and in vivo approaches. These studies
will provide crucial mechanistic insight into 60S dynamics and will enable the development of therapeutics
focused on eIF6 and its regulators."

 Memory CD4 T cells residing at sites of infection are key orchestrators of immunity. It is increasingly clear
that key signals promoting such tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells do not overlap completely with those that
support generation of conventional memory T cell subsets. Delineating signals that optimize CD4 TRM generation
is important to improve vaccine-induced immunity against pathogens like influenza A virus (IAV) against which
antibody alone cannot confer lasting protection. Our data indicates that type I interferons (IFN) can promote a
unique activation module that optimizes the transition of anti-viral CD4 T cell effectors into TRM, and that Th1
programming, through the transcription factor T-bet, restricts the ability of cells to adopt this ‘pre-TRM’ effector
state. This proposal will breakdown key mechanisms underlying the ability of type I IFN to promote lung CD4
TRM during IAV infection and in a translational model of intranasal vaccination.
 In Aim 1, we will use mouse models to differentiate how direct type I IFN signals to CD4 T cells, and indirect
effects through modulating the inflammatory environment, impact the functional and transcriptional identity of
pre-TRM effectors and ultimately shape the TRM landscape. We will also determine the extent to which T-bet
expression by CD4 T cells effects the ability of I IFN to modulate TRM priming. In Aim 2, we will determine how
IAV-primed CD4 T cells interpret type I IFN signals through signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) molecules, and the extent to which specific STAT activation signatures by type I IFN change through the
kinetic window when we find memory fate to be determined. This analysis will be used to optimize strategies to
boost TRM through increasing availability of type I IFN to responding CD4 T cells. A hallmark of effective CD4
TRM responses is their rapid activation which results in control of viral titers before systemic immune responses
are initiated. As Type I IFNs have a suppressive impact on naive CD4 T cell activation, we propose that CD4
TRM are specialized to not only escape this suppressive impact during antigen encounter, but to harness type I
IFN as an acute ‘trigger’ optimizing their recall. In Aim 3 we will determine the extent to which this mechanism
operates, and how T-bet and specific STAT expression by TRM fine-tune this response.
 This proposal will provide high impact mechanistic data by elucidating how type I IFN can be harnessed to
improve the generation and recall of CD4 TRM, with relevance to IAV and likely other respiratory pathogens. Our
long-term goal is develop vaccine and therapeutic strategies incorporating insights from this research to improve
durable and rapidly responsive cellular immunity in the lung."

Perceived lack of control, especially during stress, has garnered substantial interest as a core mechanism
underlying major depressive disorder (MDD), particularly in the context of elevated anhedonic symptoms. This
mechanism is especially relevant for depressive symptoms that develop during adolescence, and particularly
for female adolescents, who show heightened susceptibility to disruptions in their sense of control compared to
their male peers. Yet, the neural underpinnings of perceived control disruptions in MDD remain poorly
understood. Mounting evidence indicates that perceived control shares a common neural circuitry with stress
and MDD that is rooted in the ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Neuroimaging
studies have consistently linked reduced VS activation to hedonic capacity deficits in MDD. Moreover, an
inability to recruit the vmPFC under stress has been posited to underlie maladaptive stress responses in MDD.
Directly relevant to the proposed research, perceived lack of control has also been associated with reduced
activation of this same VS-vmPFC circuit in healthy adults. However, studies to date have yet to examine
neural mechanisms of perceived control in MDD, and how stress may modulate perceived control-related
neural circuits. Additionally, neuroimaging of perceived control has not yet been extended to adolescent
populations. The current K23 proposal was designed to fill these critical knowledge gaps. Accordingly, female
adolescents (age: 14-18) with and without MDD will undergo a stress induction in conjunction with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A novel fMRI task designed to manipulate perceptions of control will be
administered before and after the stress induction. In order to assess neural predictors of “real-life” stress
responses and anhedonic symptoms, an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol will be
administered in the two weeks after the scan and at three- and six-month follow-ups. We hypothesize that VS-
vmPFC activation/connectivity in relation to perceived control will be blunted in adolescents with MDD
compared to healthy adolescents. We also expect that relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with MDD
will show decreases in VS-vmPFC activation/connectivity associated with perceived control from before to after
stress. Using different units of analysis, this study will provide a rich understanding of stress-linked
mechanisms in adolescent MDD and will be the first to utilize perceived control-related neural mechanisms to
predict future MDD symptoms. Drawing on the expertise from a complementary team of mentors (Drs. Diego
Pizzagalli & Erika Forbes) and consultants (Drs. Mauricio Delgado, Blaise Frederick, Kate Harkness and
Garrett Fitzmaurice), the applicant will receive training in adolescent MDD functional neuroanatomy (Goal #1),
task-based fMRI (Goal #2), stress neurobiology and stress assessment (Goal #3), and EMA (Goal #4). The
proposed training plan will launch the applicant into an independent research career focusing on stress-related
mechanisms underlying adolescent MDD."

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States, frequently leading to speech impairment that
creates barriers to participation in professional, social, and family settings. While recovery can be promoted
with speech motor learning treatment, residual disability remains a prominent issue. The long-term goal of this
research is to enhance intervention outcomes for individuals with acquired speech impairment by combining
theoretically-guided behavioral intervention with targeted neuromodulation. The main objectives of this
proposal are to verify the role of left ventral premotor and motor cortices in speech motor learning and to
establish that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance speech motor learning treatment by
strengthening the cortical speech network. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that speech recovery in
chronic stroke can be improved by stimulating perilesional left ventral premotor and motor cortices, thereby
promoting their engagement during speech motor learning treatment and strengthening the cortical speech
network through associative learning. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Establish the neural regions that underlie tDCS-facilitated speech motor learning; 2) Determine the extent to
which active tDCS with individualized electrode placement can enhance speech motor learning intervention
relative to sham tDCS in impaired speakers with apraxia of speech; and 3) Determine the functional
connectivity changes associated with speech motor learning-based intervention with active vs. sham tDCS in
impaired speakers with apraxia of speech. Under the first aim, the proposed research will systematically verify
the role of left ventral premotor and motor cortices in tDCS-facilitated speech motor learning using three
controls: electrode polarity, electrode position, and presence of active current. For the second aim, single-
subject intervention experiments will be used to evaluate the extent to which tDCS enhances apraxia treatment
outcomes, using individualized current modeling to target left ventral premotor and motor cortices. The third
aim determines the extent to which the treatment conditions in Aim 2 can change functional connectivity
measured with resting-state functional neuroimaging. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's
opinion, because it combines practice-based speech treatment with targeted tDCS to intensify Hebbian
plasticity and measures the extent to which this approach changes functional connectivity in the speech
network. This research will be significant because it will establish the combined effectiveness of speech motor
learning treatment and tDCS in AOS, an understudied condition. Understanding the interaction of treatment
and neuromodulation will build capacity to optimize chronic stroke recovery, with direct application to
enhancing speech skills to improve communication ability and quality of life."

Dr. Rusley is pursuing this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award to facilitate his
transition to an independent HIV prevention scientist. His career goal is to eliminate health disparities among
adolescents and young adults at risk for HIV. He has a background in pediatric and adolescent medicine, clinical
research, public health, and motivational interviewing (MI) that create a strong foundation for the proposed training and
research plan. He has assembled a highly accomplished and diverse team of mentors with complementary expertise in
adolescent sexual minority male (ASMM) health, HIV prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), behavioral
interventions, family-based interventions, implementation science, and ethical issues in adolescent sexuality research.
These mentors, along with an excellent and highly-interdisciplinary research environment at Brown University and
Rhode Island Hospital will facilitate his training and research plan, as well as his transition to an independent, NIH-
funded researcher. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV borne by sexual minority males in the US—especially
young men—and the fact that most of these men have their first sexual experience as adolescents, ASMM are a key
population for HIV prevention interventions. However, there are very few evidence-based HIV prevention interventions
for this group, in part due to complexities with parental involvement in research. Many experts have called for inclusion
of parents in HIV prevention interventions for ASMM, given the key protective roles they can play in their children’s
lives; yet there are no family-based HIV prevention interventions for ASMM in the US. PrEP is a highly effective HIV
prevention tool that has recently been added to the existing HIV prevention toolkit with FDA approval for adolescents in
2018, yet uptake among ASMM has been low. The few studies that address this gap in PrEP uptake among ASMM
suggest possible barriers may include: concerns about disclosure of sexuality to parents (“outing”), knowledge of and
motivation to use PrEP, and lack of access to primary care clinicians who prescribe PrEP. Therefore, we will develop a
family-based HIV prevention intervention for ASMM that can be used in primary care settings. First, we will conduct a
formative evaluation using in-depth individual interviews with ASMM (n=12-15) and parents (n=12-15) to determine
barriers and facilitators to the success of the planned intervention (Specific Aim (SA) 1). Second, we will adapt an
existing evidenced-based, motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to include PrEP education and counseling, as well
as a family-based component (a video-based education module about parental support, sexuality communication, and
PrEP as HIV prevention). We will then pilot the intervention with ASMM-parent dyads (n=10) (SA2). Finally, we will
conduct an exploratory randomized trial of the intervention with ASMM-parent dyads (n=100) to test its effect on PrEP
uptake at baseline and 8-week follow up, and to determine feasibility and acceptability (SA3). Overall, the intervention
will reach a difficult to access population, build protective parent relationships, and increase PrEP uptake among a key
population at risk, thereby reducing new HIV infections. The proposed training and research plan will provide Dr. Rusley
the experience and mentoring needed to expand his skills and become an independent and leading HIV prevention
scientist."

Effective cell-based immunity depends on two major systems: (i) the ability to generate a diverse TCR
repertoire capable of recognizing antigens from previously unencountered pathogens, and (ii) the ability to
discriminate between self- and non-self-antigens and prevent autoimmunity. Inappropriate balance between
these two systems causes a variety of disease states including ineffective tumor immune surveillance and poor
pathogen clearance due to gaps in the TCR repertoire, or the onset of autoimmunity and off target
immunopathology during infection. Autoimmunity can be curtailed by deleting autoreactive TCRs or diverting
them into the Treg lineage in the thymus. However, given the high degree of cross-reactivity of TCRs this
process cannot be truly efficient at removing all self-reactive TCRs as this would remove much of the potential
diversity of the conventional TCR repertoire, thereby impairing immunity to pathogens. Thus, a key biological
question is how thymic selection functions to balance protection against autoimmunity while providing
effective immunity against pathogens. We hypothesize that a unique population of thymic recirculating
Treg cells (RT-Treg) act as a rheostat to decrease the stringency of selection once peripheral Treg cell
tolerance is established, thereby allowing for a more diverse and pathogen-reactive conventional
immune system. This will be examined in two specific aims: Aim 1: Define RT-Treg heterogeneity and
functional consequences of RT-Treg accumulation. Aim 2: Identify the mechanisms by which RT-Treg cells affect
immune repertoires and mTEC numbers. The proposed experiments will elucidate the role that RT-Treg play in
governing the stringency of central tolerance, both promoting effector cell diversity and ensuring maintenance
of self-tolerance by Treg cells."

3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by a typically de novo 1.6 Mb deletion of 21 genes. The syndrome is
associated with an astonishing 40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia, as well as cognitive disability, a high
rate of autism and social disability, executive function deficits and pronounced prevalence of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clinically significant graphomotor weakness, and manifestation of anxiety
disorders. The factors that contribute to this phenotypic heterogeneity are not understood. We propose to
evaluate 200 individuals with the 3q29 deletion, to better define phenotypic manifestations and identify risk
modifiers for key phenotypes. In particular, we seek to understand how polygenic background and sex of the
proband may modify risk for psychosis, cognitive disability, social functioning, and other phenotypes. To
facilitate our evaluation and attenuate ascertainment bias, we have developed a remote phenotyping battery,
which does not require travel to a testing site. This remote battery removes barriers to participation for our
study subjects and dramatically reduces costs, improving the efficiency of our study. Using this validated
phenotyping protocol, we will characterize 200 new study subjects with the 3q29 deletion, and identify the full
phenotypic spectrum, sex-dependent phenotypic risks and significant comorbid relationships. We will also
phenotype biological parents to contextualize the burden of illness in 3q29 deletion syndrome relative to
departure from mid-parental phenotype, and clarify the range of phenotypic heterogeneity in 3q29 deletion
syndrome. We will collect DNA from our study subjects, to directly test the contribution of polygenic risk to
selected phenotypes. Finally, in a collaboration with the NIMH-sponsored Genes 2 Mental Health Network, we
will compare the phenotypic spectrum and risk modifiers of 3q29 deletion syndrome with >2,000 samples from
other genomic disorders associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including
22q11.2 deletion and duplication, 16p11 deletion and duplication, 1q21 deletion, and others. At the end of this
project, we will have a comprehensive survey of 3q29 deletion associated phenotypes, an understanding of
how sex and polygenic background may increase or attenuate phenotypic risks in 3q29 deletion syndrome,
and an appreciation for how the 3q29 deletion compares to the broader landscape of rare genetic disorders
associated with developmental brain disorders. All genotype and phenotype data from this study will be shared
in publicly-available databases, including dbGaP and NDAR."

 A remarkable feature of lipid membranes is their fluidity: they can self-heal, bend, and circulate.
Individual cells also experience and respond to the flows in their environment. Flow responses regulate diverse
processes such as blood pressure, bone density, and neural growth. This is particularly apparent in blood
vessels, where a monolayer of endothelial cells forms the interface between flowing blood and stationary
tissue. Correlation between regions of low flow and atherosclerotic plaques was observed a century ago,
leading to the hypothesis that shear flow impacts endothelial cell function. Understanding how cells accomplish
mechanotransduction of shear stress into cellular signals is of wide interest. However, the molecular
determinants behind flow mechanotransduction remain unclear. Particularly, we lack information on the lateral
movement of extracellular membrane proteins located at the cell-fluid interface. While flow has been observed
to transport membrane proteins, how this transport affects protein function and cell responses remains
unknown.
 The goal of the proposed studies is to quantitatively measure the physical interactions specific to lipid
membranes that determine how lipids and proteins move in response to flow and test whether flow transport of
a membrane protein activates intracellular signaling in endothelial cells. Our central hypothesis is that
physiologically significant protein and lipid concentration gradients arise from physical interactions between
fluid flow and complex membranes. This hypothesis is based on the premise that extracellular lipid-anchored
proteoglycans like glypican-1 can be transported along the plasma membrane by external flow, with the
aqueous part of the protein acting as a molecular sail. We will accomplish three specific aims: Our first aim is
to identify the fundamental properties and principles that govern flow transport of membrane-linked proteins in
model membranes and to build a model to predict protein motion in physiological contexts. In the second aim,
we will determine how the flow-mediated lateral transport of a physiologically important membrane protein
(glypican-1) initiates the short-term flow response in endothelial cells. In our third aim, we will investigate how
lipid sorting by flow contributes to flow signaling in our model system and living cell membranes.
 Our approach is to conduct parallel experiments in model membranes and living cells, allowing us to
directly relate physiological function to molecular biophysics. The experiments rely on the PI's expertise using
experimental microfluidics and confocal microscopy to determine fundamental membrane properties. While the
model protein studied here is specific to endothelial cells, the principles of fluid mechanics that we will uncover
are universal. We, therefore, anticipate that our models will apply to multiple cell lines and flow conditions, and
will lay the groundwork for future research directions."
10834234,"Neurons communicate using both chemical transmission at traditional synapses and electrical transmission
through gap junctions. Electrical transmission is well studied in the mammalian retina, where gap junctions
exist between all five major classes of neurons. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output cells of the retina,
comprise ~40 functional types in mammals. Gap junctional coupling among RGCs has always been described
as “homotypic,” that is, between RGCs of the same type. We have discovered, for the first time, heterotypic
electrical coupling in the mouse retina, between two RGCs of different types, called F-miniON and F-miniOFF
RGCs.
The existence of heterotypic RGC coupling breaks the rule of functional parallelism between RGC channels
and requires new ideas about the role of coupling in retinal computation. This project aims to explore the
functional role of heterotypic RGC coupling in the F-mini network through two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will
determine whether coupling between F-miniON and F-miniOFF RGCs creates a novel pathway for mixing ON and
OFF signals in the inner retina. In Aim 2 we will determine which features of moving stimuli are encoded by
synchronized spiking between F-miniON and F-miniOFF RGCs.
The proposed studies will advance our understanding of how chemical and electrical synaptic inputs interact to
perform neural computations and how sharing of signals between parallel pathways contributes to sensory
encoding."
10839362,"The overall aim of this application is to better understand the role of endogenous Glucagon-Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) signaling, primarily in the fasting state, to influence α-cell and β-cell function both during the fasting state and in response to subsequent meal challenges. This has been an ignored aspect of GLP-1 physiology, given its primarily post-prandial effects. However, therapeutic agents that harness the GLP-1 pathway lower both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In addition, a non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in the GLP-1 receptor, rs3765467, previously shown by us to enhance response to hyperglycemia and to GLP-1, lowers fasting glucose and protects from type 2 diabetes (T2DM). GLP-1 arises by post-translational processing of proglucagon by a specific prohormone convertase enzyme (PC-1/3). There is evidence that this enzyme can be expressed within the islet enabling local production of GLP-1. This may function in a paracrine fashion to augment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose mediated suppression of glucagon. Expression of PC-1/3 and GLP-1 is increased in T2DM and also by exposure to hyperglycemia and free fatty acids. An explanation of these observations is that GLP-1 may help islet adaptation to metabolic stressors at least early in the course of T2DM. Intriguingly, our preliminary data shows that the effect of antagonizing fasting endogenous GLP-1 secretion differs between people with and without T2DM. Another aspect of α-cell to β-cell communication is that intra-islet glucagon concentrations can act as stimulus to insulin secretion, signaling partially through the GLP-1 receptor. The importance of this in normal physiology and in T2DM is unknown. The proposed experiments will elucidate how rs3765467 alters islet function in the presence and absence of GLP-1 receptor blockade. In addition, we will examine the role of endogenous GLP-1 secretion in T2DM and compare responses to metabolic stress. The experimental conditions will also enable us to examine the role of GLP-1 signaling in the insulin secretory response to glucagon. Successful completion of these experiments will clarify the role of endogenous GLP-1 in vivo."

 The critical national shortage of veterinary scientists with PhD training who can provide their unique
expertise in biomedical research recognized. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Research
Council have recognized that veterinarians are broadly trained health professionals who are uniquely qualified
to lead biomedical research, having an understanding of disease in the context of the whole organism. The
Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (TAMU CVM) T32 training program is a three-year post-doctoral
training program with the objective of providing PhD training to veterinarians in cutting edge biomedical research
approaches and address the national need for this expertise. This renewal builds upon two previous successful
project periods, 2010-2014 and 2015-2020, under the directorship of Dr. Ann Kier, who will assume an Advisor
role to the PD (Albert Mulenga) and this renewal and serve on student committees. The TAMU CVM T32 will
recruit outstanding trainees DVMS. In previous budget periods, trainees were recruited after they had completed
their DVM residency program at the TAMU CVM or other schools in different specialties and had passed their
specialty boards. During the residency program, prospective trainees with expressed desire to join the T32
program are advised to take relevant coursework pertinent to the PhD training. In this way, trainees will focus on
conducting their dissertation research and complete PhD degree requirement within the three years that is
supported under T32 funding. In the event that the trainee does not meet requirement for PhD graduation during
the three-year T32 support, the mentor will provide support. During the two project periods, the program recruited
14 DVMs into graduate school. Of the 14 trainees, eight have graduated with their PhDs and seven have taken
employment in biomedical research, one is in a temporary private practice, one is on schedule to complete her
PhD, and five are still in training. Of the five; one trainee on track to finish in spring of 2020. Of the five, one
trainee is on track to finish in spring of 2020 and the remaining are scheduled to graduate during this renewal:
one trainee in year one of this renewal, and two in year two, and one in year 3.
 The NIH has recognized the fact that although the veterinary curriculum is analogous to medical school
training, it provides an added benefit, the comparative nature of training in normal anatomy/physiology and
abnormal disease states, providing an excellent basis for biomedical disease inquiry. This specialized training
uniquely prepares veterinarian researchers to contribute to biomedical research in the modeling of human
pathophysiology using laboratory animal models. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research is designed to open
up new opportunities to tackle the multifactorial causes of diseases not yet understood, particularly those
associated with a longer lived, aging population, including heart disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus,
autoimmunity, and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. The comparative nature of their training equips
veterinarians with insight and expertise to conduct clinical research."
10932346,"Abstract
 Millions of people suffer from chronic pelvic pain that is often associated with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain
syndrome (IC/BPS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Several factors have been implicated in the
pathophysiology of these disorders but mechanisms underlying pain chronification are still poorly understood.
 This proposal is motivated by our previous studies characterizing neuron-glial interactions in sensory ganglia
and demonstrating their importance in chronic pain models involving orofacial and hindlimb inflammation. Based
on these findings, we focus on neural integration processes that occur within the sensory ganglia (dorsal root
ganglia: DRG) that innervate pelvic organs, and investigate whether and to what extent altered intercellular
signaling between DRG sensory neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs) provides a common mechanism in
bladder and colon pain. Moreover, we propose that such neuron-glia interactions may contribute to pelvic organ
crosstalk that underlies the known comorbidity of IC/BPS and IBS.
 We have shown that neurons in sensory ganglia are in close spatial and functional contact with SGCs. SGCs
support neuronal homeostasis but also respond to neuronal stimulation through release of “gliotransmitters” and
other chemical mediators, such as ATP and cytokines, which modulate neuronal excitability. There is strong
evidence that activation of glia in the CNS and PNS play key roles in development and maintenance of pain, and
the importance of the crosstalk between SGCs and neurons in pathological pain is becoming increasingly
evident. Little is still known, however, of whether and to what extent the crosstalk between SGCs and neurons
contributes to pelvic organ sensitization and cross-sensitization, and through which mechanisms SGC-neuron
signaling may be enhanced and thereby contribute to pelvic pain. We have shown that in experimental colitis,
gap junction (GJ) mediated neuron-SGC signaling is enhanced in the DRG innervating the colon. Moreover,
findings from our studies with deletion of P2X7 receptors and pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels, main molecular
mediators of SGC-neuron signaling, suggest that enhanced SGC-neuron communication through activation of
the P2X7R-Panx1 complex plays a key role in development of DRG hyperexcitability and tactile hypersensitivity.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intercellular GJ and P2X7R-Panx1 mediated signaling in the
DRG play a key role in sensitization of pelvic afferents by contributing mechanisms that enhance SGC
activation and neuronal excitability and can contribute to colon-bladder cross-sensitization. To test this
hypothesis, we will employ well established models of direct bladder and colon insult, and combined behavioral,
functional and molecular approaches using wildtype and transgenic mice with global or cell-specific deletion of
Cx43, Panx1 and P2X7R. Findings from these studies are expected to demonstrate the key role of pathologically
enhanced SGC-neuron signaling in the development of pelvic pain and visceral cross-sensitization, and reveal
that gap junctions and the P2X7R-Panx1 functional complex drive the enhanced SGC-neuron intercellular
signaling in this process, providing novel therapeutic targets for future clinical translation."
10846622,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cells respond to their environment by detecting extracellular signals that dictate how energy resources,
including lipids, are utilized. In complex tissues, cells with specialized metabolic functions perceive
developmental, nutritional, and environmental inputs that strictly control the allocation of lipids into different
metabolic pathways in order to maintain organismal energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of these pathways
can lead to metabolic disease and cancer. The molecular mechanisms that govern lipid homeostasis,
including the intercellular signals and the intracellular regulatory factors that control metabolic flux, remain
poorly understood.
 Proliferative signal transduction pathways, including mTOR and MAP Kinase, promote cellular growth and
influence metabolic function; however, the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of these pathways
that control lipid homeostasis remain largely unknown. The long-term scope of this research program is to
uncover new regulatory factors of pro-growth signal transduction pathways and to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms by which they exert metabolic control. We will employ an interdisciplinary approach, using
unbiased genetic strategies in combination with functional genomics and biochemical analyses in different
biological systems, to address several fundamental questions in the field of lipid homeostasis.
 Although mTOR and MAP Kinases are known to participate extensively in metabolic and growth control,
major gaps exist in our understanding of how these pathways influence lipid allocation. The first goal of this
project is to identify the inter-tissue signaling events that regulate the activity of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2),
which is poorly understood in any system, and to further define the metabolic function of mTORC2 in a
specialized cell type - the C. elegans intestine. Leveraging the power of unbiased genetic and genomic
approaches in the worm, we will then identify the transcriptional effectors of mTORC2 signaling that are
responsible for controlling the expression of metabolic genes in order to gain a comprehensive view of how
mTORC2 regulates energy homeostasis.
 MAP Kinases, which function broadly in stress responses and cell proliferation, are crucial for maintaining
cellular homeostasis; however, how MAPK signaling controls lipid metabolism pathways is poorly understood.
The second goal of this project is to define how different MAPK pathways influence lipid homeostasis, then
investigate the potential avenues of cross-talk between MAPK and other pro-growth pathways, and finally to
employ an unbiased genetic approach to identify the downstream effectors of MAPK signaling that control lipid
homeostasis and growth. Together, this research will shed light on how proliferative signaling pathways act
together to shape the metabolic function of specialized cells and provide mechanistic insight into how
dysregulation of these pathways can lead to metabolic dysfunction and disease."
10846626,"Project Summary
A substantial proportion of psychiatric inpatients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Readmissions not
only are disruptive but also cause enormous economic burden for patients and families, and are a key driver of
rising healthcare costs. Reducing and predicting unplanned readmission are therefore major unmet needs of
psychiatric care. Developing machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP) prediction tools
using electronic health records (EHRs) is a key priority as such tools could not only be used to help target the
delivery of resource-intensive interventions to those patients at greatest risk, but also reduce psychiatric health-
care costs. A key aspect in building effective risk predictive models is the modeling of temporal structure in the
narratives. Information about the historical and present health states and timing of events (e.g., substance use
start/stop timing, recent fluctuations in suicidality or symptoms), may play a key role in predicting readmission
risk. Natural language annotation (i.e., tagging text such as events, symptoms, and anchoring them on a timeline)
is a key step for training ML classifiers. No psychiatry-specific resources or guidelines exist for the modeling of
temporality in clinical text, and as a result no robust scalable and explainable ML predictive models incorporating
temporal information have been developed.
We propose to deliver a psychiatric specific temporal relation annotation scheme, build open-source tools for
extracting temporal information, and develop readmission prediction models for psychiatric patients. Aim 1 is a
data resource creation aim in which we create a large repository of psychiatric text for building our readmission
classifier, de-identify a subset of that data to allow for sharing with the research community, and create a layer
of temporal annotations for that subset. In Aim 2, we extract temporal information from the data in the repository
to create temporal graphs, and apply graph neural networks to these graphs to extract features for predicting
30-day readmission risk. In Aim 3 we build and evaluate multiple versions of 30-day readmission risk classifiers,
and feedback performance to Aim 2 to improve temporal modeling. We develop unsupervised clustering on top
of our classifiers to discover patient sub-groups. We include practical evaluations including a comparison to
human experts and an evaluation of model performance on simulated future data. The study brings together a
team experienced in psychiatric phenotyping and application of EHRs, and a team active in developing cutting-
edge methods in ML for natural language data. This work will serve as the foundation for future translational
studies, including implementing readmission classifiers into clinical workflows and clinical trials of interventions
to reduce readmission risk."

10848814,"RP1: Molecular Determinants of GIST Pathogenesis
Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is one of the most prevalent sarcoma subtypes and mesenchymal
neoplasms of the GI tract. Clinically, advanced unresectable and/or metastatic GISTs are rarely curable despite
their initial responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Current risk models (e.g., Miettinen, NIH modified), although
useful to predict patients at high risk of recurrence following surgery, often underestimate recurrence risk in
cases of intermediate size or mitotic count and non-gastric location, and no current risk stratification schemes
consider molecular biomarkers. Discovering, validating, and incorporating molecular determinants of aggressive
and metastatic clinical behavior in GIST clinical care are critical knowledge gaps. Our recent pan-cancer genomic
characterization of metastatic vs. primary tumors and GIST-specific genomic and clinical analysis of a MSK
discovery cohort of >400 untreated patients revealed that biallelic loss of function mutations in MAX or MGA
(each 5%), and MYC amplifications (0.5%), were enriched in untreated metastatic GIST compared to primary
localized GIST. Further, MAX/MGA/MYC genetic alterations and arm-level deletion of 1p were associated with
worse relapse free survival (p<0.001). MAX is the obligative heterodimerization transcriptional activator of MYC
and modulates MYC regulation of cellular function. MAX also interacts with MGA, a core component of the
PRC1.6 complex that regulates cellular differentiation. We hypothesize that genetic perturbations of
MAX/MGA/MYC and arm-level copy number alterations (e.g., -1p) in GIST promote cellular plasticity,
tumorigenesis, and aggressive metastatic behavior through functional inactivation of the PRC1.6 complex and
may represent independent molecular risk biomarkers for GIST relapse and facilitate discovery of rational
pathway targets for metastatic GIST. Here, we propose preclinical and clinical investigations, leveraging
sophisticated and novel multi-omics (e.g., transcriptome, cistrome, epigenome, single cell (sc) and/or single
nuclei (sn) RNA-seq, scATAC-seq coupled with a CellTagging system for clonal tracking) and machine learning
approaches to 1) elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MAX/MGA/MYC perturbations involved in enhanced
cellular plasticity, migration, and metastatic behavior in GIST, and 2) identify and validate molecular biomarkers
predictive of recurrence risk and adjuvant therapy determination in primary GIST after resection, using discovery
and multiple validation GIST patient cohorts to develop a combinatorial pathologic-genomic nomogram to guide
adjuvant imatinib therapy decisions. These studies could change clinical practice in GIST adjuvant treatment
and identify novel therapeutic strategies to target metastases in GIST management."
10848815,"RP2: Targeting Hippo Pathway Dependence in Genetically Complex Sarcomas
ABSTRACT
Our overall goal is to find effective targeted therapies for 4 of the most common and clinically aggressive
histologic types of genetically complex sarcoma: well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS), dedifferentiated
liposarcoma (DDLS), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). Disease
recurrence after surgery and metastasis are common, and patients have few treatment options once they
develop advanced disease. Therefore, new targeted therapies are urgently needed to improve patients'
outcomes. However, the complexity of alterations in these sarcomas has made it difficult to find the true drivers
of oncogenesis. Despite this complexity, we have found that all 4 subtypes appear to share critical dependence
on activation of the Hippo pathway through increased expression of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and
TAZ. Our preliminary results have further shown that WDLS, DDLS, MFS, and UPS rely on the RNA helicase
eIF4A for the translation of the YAP, TAZ, and TEAD mRNAs into protein. We therefore hypothesize that most
WDLS, DDLS, MFS, and UPS tumors depend on Hippo signaling and eIF4A for growth and survival. In this
research project, we will first examine the role of the Hippo pathway in promoting sarcoma genesis,
differentiation, progression, and metastasis. Second, we will evaluate the single-agent efficacy of the new
eIF4A inhibitor TDI-7663 in genetically complex sarcoma models, both in cell lines and in a preclinical phase
2–like trial design using 182 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that capture the range of genotypes of
these genetically complex sarcomas. The PDX trial will also allow a rigorous study of the mechanisms of es-
cape from eIF4A inhibition by uncovering biomarkers of innate and acquired resistance through prolonged
treatment with TDI-7663. We will map the effects of TDI-7663 on mRNA translation in relevant sarcoma cells
and PDX models using ribosome footprinting. Finally, we seek to advance TDI-7663 toward the clinic through
investigative new drug (IND)–enabling toxicity, pharmacology, and efficacy studies. Clarification of the roles of
the Hippo pathway and oncogenic translation will elucidate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis,
identify new drug targets, identify effective combination therapies to combat resistance, and enable precision
oncology. We expect that the IND-enabling studies will lead to a phase 1 clinical trial of TDI-7663 in patients
with DDLS, MFS, and UPS within 5 years."
10848816,"RP3: Identifying Targetable Epigenetic and Immuno-Oncologic Vulnerabilities in Synovial Sarcoma
ABSTRACT
Synovial sarcoma (SS) is driven by SS18::SSX-dependent chromatin dysregulation, suggesting that elucidating
key aspects of this deregulation might point to therapeutic epigenetic vulnerabilities. At the same time, driver
fusions such as SS18::SSX may generate a unique class of shared, or public, neoantigens because they create
novel peptide sequences that diverge significantly from self-proteins. Specifically, the junctional amino acid
sequence of the chimeric SS18::SSX proteins is unique to SS cells. In addition, there is evidence that epigenetic
modulation may potentiate immunotherapy approaches. Thus, our overall goal is to identify epigenetic and
immuno-oncologic vulnerabilities in SS and potential synergies between them towards an overall goal of long-
term responses in metastatic SS. To accomplish this, our multidisciplinary research team of experts in cancer
genomics and epigenetics, T cell immunobiology and immune-peptidomics, and clinical trials in pediatric and
young adult sarcomas will pursue 3 specific aims. Aim 1 is to decipher H3K36 methylation-dependent crosstalk
and vulnerabilities in SS, on the basis of our clinical genomic profiling data on SS identifying recurrent loss of
function in histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferases (e.g. SETD2) in ~10% of cases. In isogenic cell lines,
we will determine how decreased H3K36me3 affects the genomic localization of SS18::SSX and fusion protein-
dependent transcriptional programs and establish the key determinants of DNA methylation and polycomb-
mediated chromatin domains. We will validate these observations in prospectively collected patient-derived
tissues and xenografts (PDXs). Finally, we will identify SETD2-/--specific dependencies in SS using a chemical
probe approach; resulting hits will be studied mechanistically and validated in both PDXs and isogenic SETD2-/-
models. Because epigenetic mechanisms are important tumor-intrinsic mediators of immune escape, we will
also explore whether SETD2 loss affects SS immunogenicity. Aim 2 is to measure the immunogenicity of an
SS18::SSX public neoantigen and test the antitumor efficacy of T cells genetically engineered with a T cell
receptor recognizing it. Specifically, we will define the HLA-restricted immunogenic peptides resulting from the
SS18::SSX fusion protein, retrieve the TCR α/β gene sequences associated with SS patient-derived T cells that
recognize such peptides, and validate that cloned TCRs confer fusion-derived reactivity and tumor regression in
vivo when retrovirally transduced into a polyclonal T cell population. In Aim 3, we will determine the tolerability,
immunogenicity, and antitumor efficacy of a multivalent mRNA vaccine encoding the SS18::SSX(1/2) junction
sequence and multiple cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) highly expressed in SS, in combination with an anti-PD-L1
antibody, via a phase I/II clinical trial in collaboration with Moderna and TRACON. Correlative analyses
associated with the trial will measure how the vaccine affects the T cell response to polypeptides containing the
above sequences and resolve the HLA restriction and TCR clonotypes for T cells responding to the SS18::SSX
fusion and CTA sequences."

In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses
(arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses
within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction
and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great
concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas.
Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species
harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown.
Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and
global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health
structures in Venezuela.
 The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-
NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling
approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known
arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics,
map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within
these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other
vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these
samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine
learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on
prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing
human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a
particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity.
We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human
and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.
 Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health
agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence
into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity
to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential
to avert full-blown emergence."

 The U.S. is experiencing a sea change in healthcare delivery, with ever more physicians employed by
hospitals. Cardiology, in particular, has changed dramatically: a decade ago, 90% of cardiologists were in
private practice, while today, in many states, a majority are employed by hospitals. Yet almost nothing is
known about how this “vertical integration” affects patient care or outcomes. We will study the effects of
hospital-cardiologist integration for patients hospitalized with incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or heart
failure (HF), using a novel integration measure and a large, longitudinal Medicare dataset. We will use time
variation in the amounts that Medicare FFS pays providers for cardiac tests as a plausibly exogenous driver of
integration, which permits difference-in-differences analysis and “causal” estimates of the effects of integration.
 Integration proponents argue that integration can improve healthcare “value” – increase quality, reduce
utilization and cost, or both, through better care coordination and innovation in care delivery. However, there is
limited evidence to support these claims. Meanwhile, critics note that integration often leads to higher prices
paid by commercial insurers. Cardiology is an excellent area in which to study the effect of integration due to
dramatic growth in vertical integration, the importance of cardiovascular disease, and the complexity of AMI
and HF treatment, which increases the potential for integration to affect care and outcomes.
 Our study sample is all cardiologists (~40,000) who care for the 4 million Medicare patients who experience
an incident AMI (1.5 million) or HF hospitalization (2.5 million) from 2002-2021. This large, longitudinal sample
provides sufficient power to assess a broad range of care processes, patient outcomes, utilization and costs
that the potential benefits of integration (care coordination, monitoring, innovation) can plausibly effect. As a
basis for this study, we developed, and pilot tested in Colorado, a measure of vertical integration, which
substantially outperforms prior measures in avoiding both false negatives (not identifying integrated
cardiologists) and false positives (identifying cardiologists as integrated when they are not).
 It is critically important to patients, providers, insurers, and policymakers to determine how vertical
integration affects healthcare quality, outcomes, and cost. CMS is assessing whether to enforce pay parity
(thus removing the financial spur for integration) and legislators in several states are debating whether to
restrict integration, with limited evidence on its effects. This project is innovative because of its 1) use of a new,
validated, accurate measure of vertical integration, 2) use of a DiD research design which permits credible
causal inference, 3) evaluation of patients with incident AMI and HF hospitalization across a broad range of
care processes, patient outcomes and costs that integration can potentially effect, and 4) use of a large,
longitudinal Medicare dataset that provides sufficient power to detect small differences in outcomes."

This T32 application seeks to equip pediatric rheumatology fellows with the investigative skills
necessary to succeed in meaningful scientific careers in academic pediatric rheumatology. The
program is based in a large Division of Pediatric Rheumatology (PR) with several center grants
and NIH-funded investigators. The Pediatric Rheumatology Division, including its related clinic,
is part of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and The Children's Hospital
Research Foundation (TCHRF), as well as part of the University of Cincinnati College of
Medicine (UCCOM) with its clinical and biomedical science departments. The Pediatric
Rheumatology divisional research program draws strength from uniquely integrated teams of
clinical, translational and basic researchers involved in active ongoing collaborations with
members of Divisions of Immunobiology, Human Genetics, Hematology/Oncology, Bone
Marrow Transplantation, Nephrology, Pharmacology, Radiology, Psychology and
Bioinformatics. The primary faculty advisors were selected from 15 specialties divisions based
on the ongoing collaboration with Rheumatology faculty, high research productivity and strong
record of training of young scientists. Although the main emphasis will be placed on MD and
MD/PhD trainees in the PR Fellowship Program, PhD candidates with strong interest in
translational research in pediatric rheumatologic diseases will be sought as well. The majority of
trainees will focus their research and training activities in one of the two special emphasis areas
of strength, unique to the CCHMC research center and the Division of Rheumatology: (1)
application of bioinformatics and “omics” technologies including genomics, epigenetics,

10848457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The liver exhibits remarkable capacity for regeneration, but chronic injury or severe acute damage can
overwhelm regenerative mechanisms and lead to end-stage liver disease. The lack of effective medical therapies
combined with insufficient donor organ availability necessitates the development of new regenerative medicine-
based therapies and a deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms of liver repair. The transcription factor
Sox9 is required for stem/progenitor cell function in a number of epithelial tissues and has been shown to
establish cellular identity. In the liver, Sox9 is required for timing of biliary epithelial cell (BEC) specification in
development and is broadly expressed in adult BECs. Sox9 deficiency worsens cholangiopathy in mouse models
of Alagille Syndrome. My preliminary data demonstrate ductal paucity in Sox9 knockout mice, suggesting a
central role for Sox9 in BEC specification. This proposal seeks to define functional regulation of intrahepatic BEC
networks by Sox9, during development and injury-associated ductular reaction (DR). DR is a common
characteristic of liver disease and is defined by the proliferative expansion of BECs. Furthermore, based on
damage type, timing, and/or extent of damage, DR can involve lineage conversion between mature hepatocytes
and BECs that contributes to tissue regeneration. The genetic regulation of DR remains poorly understood. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that Sox9 is required to establish proper intrahepatic BEC
networks in development and ductular reaction. I will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim 1A will establish the developmental requirement of Sox9 to form functional intrahepatic bile ducts in mice
through the use of histology, bile acid assays, organoid assays, and 3D tissue imaging. Aim 1B will investigate
the role of Sox9 in specifying BEC subpopulations through scRNA-seq. Aim 2 will determine how Sox9 maintains
adult BEC populations during DR using inducible Sox9 knockout mice. BEC function will be assayed by liver
serum biochemistry, histology, and lineage tracing. This project will determine how Sox9 establishes and
maintains BEC populations and provide me with training towards my goal of obtaining a research-focused faculty
position studying GI tissue homeostasis and regeneration. This work is significant because the findings will help
develop an understanding of basic mechanisms of liver repair that can be used to identify novel targets for
therapeutics to restore liver function in end stage liver disease."

Breastfeeding is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service and American Academy of Pediatrics to
optimize infant nutrition and health. Breastfeeding initiation is approaching 85% of U.S. mothers, yet significant
gaps remain regarding our understanding of human milk and lactation as a biologic system. These gaps
undermine our ability to identify influences that may impair breastfeeding or reduce quality of milk. Obesity is
an ongoing public health epidemic that affects at least 29% of pregnant women and 19% of children and
adolescents. Maternal obesity influences not only pregnancy but also reduces breastfeeding duration and
exclusivity. In turn, reduced breastfeeding is associated with greater risk of childhood obesity in most studies,
though concerns about residual confounding undermine confidence in these findings. In addition, many small
studies have reported that maternal obesity is associated with shifts in milk components (notably, leptin,
inflammatory cytokines, fatty acids, oligosaccharides, and peptides) associated child adiposity or obesity. Many
of these shifts could be unhealthy and contribute to child adiposity by various means. To convincingly define
the impact of maternal obesity and its associated inflammation and co-morbidities on human milk, lactation and
child health, a systems approach is needed, drawing on the power of next generation technologies and large
cohorts. Here, we propose the MOM2CHild Study, which leverages systems biology towards discoveries in
maternal obesity, milk, and translation to child health. MOM2CHild will use data and samples from the
PREVAIL and IMPRINT birth cohorts, which are funded under cooperative agreements with CDC and NIAID,
respectively. These cohorts enroll Cincinnati mothers in pregnancy and follow children to >2 years. PREVAIL
has completed follow-up of 245 mother-infant pairs. IMPRINT will complete enrollment of 1,370 mother-infant
pairs by 2023. Both cohorts were designed and enacted by the same team, involve comprehensive
questionnaire and health databases and sample collection, including milk and other samples. Standardized
human milk collections from study mothers are undertaken at weeks 2 and 6. Neither cohort was originally
funded to extensively characterize human milk components, but samples have been carefully collected and
banked for that purpose. Under MOM2CHild, we will use the wealth of data and samples from PREVAIL and
IMPRINT cohorts, and apply metabolomics, fatty acid profiling, proteomics, glycomics, and microbiome
analysis, supported by state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning to: 1) Extensively characterize the
impact of maternal obesity, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation on milk composition using a systems
biology approach; 2) Identify the impact of maternal obesity, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation on
lactation success; and 3) Determine the impact of breastfeeding and variation in human milk composition on
child adiposity/obesity, inflammation, and metabolome to age 2. Our team is well-qualified in the scientific
domains needed to succeed in our aims, which align with the NICHD BEGIN initiative and RFA-HD-22-020."
10848464,"Metformin has healthspan and lifespan enhancing effects in model organisms and is a candidate therapy for
aging in humans. The exact mechanism of action of metformin is poorly understood, but the mitochondrion is
clearly a critical metformin target involving modulation of respiratory-chain function attributed to inhibition of
Complex-1 as well as other mitochondrial actions on fission, reactive oxygen species production, etc. Our lab
described the presence of multiple small open reading frames (smORFs) within mitochondrial DNA that
encode a novel class of mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs). These MDPs have diverse cellular actions,
often leading to improved metabolism, cytoprotection, and healthspan. We also demonstrated that
mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) within these MDPs change their activity and increase
risk of aging-related diseases. Recently, we developed a novel bioinformatic approach to assess changes in
the expression of the entire mitochondrial smORFome called MDPseq. Using MDPSeq, we can demonstrate
profound changes in the expression of MDPs in disease states as well as during aging. We re-analyzed
multiple publicly available RNAseq datasets of humans and mice treated with metformin and observed
dramatic changes in the MDP smORF RNA transcript levels. After synthesizing the MDPs most potently
regulated by metformin and comparing them to metformin in several in vitro systems, we identified a number of
candidate metformin-induced MDPs that act in a metformin-mimetic fashion. One of these MDPs, named
Metformin-stimulated Mitochondrial-Derived Peptide (Ms.MDP), has similar activity to metformin on glucose
metabolism, mitochondrial function, and AMPK signaling. Ms.MDP siRNA diminishes some of metformin
actions. When administered to mice fed a high-fat diet, Ms.MDP significantly attenuated weight-gain and
dramatically reduced blood sugar, ALT, AST, and multiple inflammatory cytokines similarly – or more potently –
than metformin. Thus, we hypothesize that a key mechanism of metformin is MDP regulation, and that these
metformin-regulated MDPs mediate some of the functions of metformin. We further hypothesize that MDPs are
crucially involved in the anti-aging effects of metformin, which in turn can potentially help define individuals that
will respond to metformin and possibly serve as alternative healthspan-enhancing treatments. Our specific
aims to test this are as follows: 1: Identify human MDP smORF RNA transcripts in liver that are regulated by
metformin, and mitochondrial DNA variants that determine the clinical response to metformin in several large
human cohorts. 2: Compare the effects of aging and metformin on the MDP expression signature in mice. 3:
Characterize the aging-related effects of metformin-regulated MDPs in vitro, in various cell types, and 4:
Examine the in vivo mechanisms and therapeutic potential of chronic administration of promising metformin-
regulated MDPs in aged mice. Together, these studies will define a completely novel direction in
understanding the actions of metformin on delaying aging, and will establish novel biomarkers as well as
complementary/alternative anti-aging approaches."
10830378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is the major underlying risk factor for most chronic diseases, including sporadic or late onset Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Several pillars of aging, which have been proposed to underlie biological aging and its diseases,
could provide an important roadmap for identifying strategies to target and protect against AD, as has been
proposed by the geroscience hypothesis. While examples of single interventions and strategies resulting in
improved lifespan, healthspan and lower AD burden exist in preclinical models, there is now evidence that
combinatorial strategies designed to simultaneously target multiple pathways and pillars of aging can result in
greater efficacy than single agents. This may be particularly critical when attempting to translate these
discoveries to humans where disease etiology is multifactorial and complex. Given the sheer number of potential
geroprotector combinations, empirically identifying the most efficacious options to treat LOAD in a mammalian
system is simply not feasible or efficient. However, a systems approach that integrates multi-level data based
upon comparative and genomic effects in AD models, could potentially make powerful, informed predictions
regarding probability of synergistic effects between seemingly unrelated compounds and interventions.
Moreover, these predictions can be empirically tested and validated in vivo. Therefore, in response to RFA-AG-
20-013, we hypothesize that most effectively targeting AD will require the integration of comparative and systems
geroscience approaches to identify formulations that synergize to optimally target aging pillars and pathways to
prevent or delay AD beyond what can be achieved with single approaches. To this end, Aim 1 will determine the
relative ability of age-delaying strategies to modulate important pillars of aging, cognition, and gene networks in
a mouse model of amyloidosis (APP/PSEN1). This aim will use several approaches to characterize established
and emerging strategies and their effects on aging pillars, including proteostasis, inflammation, metabolism, and
macromolecular damage in relevant brain regions and peripheral tissues at 12 mo of age. We will further perform
a comparative analysis among age-delaying strategies to prevent pathology and preserve cognition, and perform
RNAseq to support to support systems analysis. We will next build a systems geroscience view of AD leveraging
multiscale data and rank the relative efficacy of each intervention, the pillars implicated in their effects, and
associated gene regulatory networks for their ability to modify the AD-related phenotype, to build a systems view
of interactions. Based upon this model, Aim 2 will use a systems approach to identify synergy for targeting
pathology and symptoms in a mouse model of amyloidosis among candidate strategies. This will first occur by
constructing a systems model to identify combination(s) with potential synergy to outperform single strategies.
The combination predicted to produce the greatest synergistic effect in silico will then be validated in vivo as
compared to controls and each intervention alone, thereby demonstrating the potential utility of systems
geroscience to identify novel combinatorial treatment strategies to treat or prevent AD."

a critical unmet need for understanding social and societal contributors to disparities in brain health. A major

Over 6 million adults in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease
Related Dementias (ADRD), a population estimated to double by 2050. Medicare costs
associated with individuals with AD/ADRD are more than three times higher than for those
without and the total Medicare spending for beneficiaries with AD/ADRD is projected to reach
$584 billion in 2050. People with ADRD are also characterized by higher complexity of comorbid
conditions and coordination of care. There is evidence of potentially inappropriate or suboptimal
care for individuals with ADRD. Medicare Advantage (MA) provides a potential opportunity to
improve the efficiency and quality of treatment for individuals with ADRD. Because MA plans
receive capitated monthly payments from Medicare, they have strong financial incentive to
manage chronic conditions and avoid unnecessary health care use. However, MA plans'
incentives to control costs could also lead to reduction in beneficial care for enrollees with
AD/ADRD. Prior research suggest that MA enrollment is associated with lower healthcare
utilization for ADRD individuals, but the results were based on cross-sectional comparisons in
self-reported outcomes between MA and TM, which could have biased estimates if MA
enrollees differed from TM enrollees in unobserved ways. With the growing share of Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in MA, it is important to understand the causal effects of MA coverage on
health care use and outcomes for beneficiaries with ADRD. Our proposed project will use
plausibly exogenous variation in MA enrollment in seven states that shifted public retiree health
benefits from TM with supplemental plans to mandatory MA plans (or in one state, from a
mandatory MA plan to TM coverage) in 2016-2019. We will use these natural experiments,
along with comprehensive Medicare data for TM and MA enrollees, to estimate the causal
effects of MA coverage on health care use, management of comorbid conditions, potentially
inappropriate medication use and polypharmacy, and institutionalization for individuals with
ADRD. These results will provide insights on the relative benefits and harms of MA enrollment
for this vulnerable population and contribute important evidence to policymakers weighing
broader expansions of Medicare Advantage."

RE: Flexible Funding Model-Infrastructure Development and Maintenance for State
Manufactured Food Regulatory Programs (U2F) Clinical Trials Not Allowed (Funding
Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number RFA-FD-23-027).
The goal of this project over the 2023-2026 three-year Period of Performance is to maintain
our agency’s full conformance with each of the 10 Manufactured Food Regulatory Program
Standards by continuing to actively participate and advance state/federal efforts for a
nationally integrated food protection system. Previous Cooperative Funding Agreements since
2011 have allowed our agency to build and maintain a quality state program for the
regulation of our manufactured food industry. In addition to MFRPS
maintenance/conformance, this project will utilize Cooperative Agreement funding to
expand our current regulatory foundation incorporating Dietary Supplements as part of our
Manufactured Foods Regulatory Program.
In an effort to better prioritize and direct our regulatory activities at reducing foodborne illness
outbreaks, our agency further intends to maintain and expand the framework and network
relative to our Food Protection Task force. Funding under a Special Projects add-on will also
be utilized to enhance our current food manufacturing database to enable quicker access to
inspectional information along with bidirectional data sharing. In order to enhance
responsiveness in terms of reducing food safety risks and prevention of foodborne outbreaks,
data sharing with our FDA partners will promote faster communication relative to violative
conditions observed during manufactured food firm inspections.
Continuing our agency’s partnership with FDA under this Cooperative Agreement is essential
for building a solid regulatory foundation, maintaining and sustaining consistency in our
agency’s inspectional approach, supporting a framework aimed at reducing foodborne illness,
and contribute to projects which support and enhances an IFSS."
10838286,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal’s objective is to determine whether changing the signaling patterns between the skeletal stem
cells (SSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
Previous data from our lab suggests that aging SSCs can cause HSC inflammaging, defined as a skewing of
HSC progeny toward myeloid lineages that may be more dysfunctional, leading to the development of vascular
disease. Whether rejuvenating the SSCs can be used as a therapy in ASCVD remains unclear. Our long-term
goal is to develop novel therapy to reverse age-related ASCVD. Our central hypothesis is that the SSC
rejuvenation will rebalance HSCs and improve the function of their progeny that travel to the
vasculature in response to injury, preventing the progression of atherosclerosis. The rationale is that
previous work by our labs and others: 1) identified and characterized the existence of SSCs in mice and
humans, 2) demonstrated that transplantation of SSCs from aged mice cause inflammaging of HSCs in young
mice, 3) showed that HSC inflammaging contributes to ASCVD, and 4) observed that activated immune cells,
some of which originate from HSCs, contribute to plaque progression. Our work will enhance the understanding
of the cross talk between organs that contribute to ASCVD, paving the way for the development of novel
strategies for disease treatment. To test our central hypothesis and attain our objective, we propose the
following aims: 1. To characterize the effects of SSC aging on the vasculature (including the perivascular
fat). We hypothesize that aged SSCs skew HSCs toward dysfunctional myeloid progeny that promote ASCVD.
For this aim, we will first perform lineage tracing experiments. The expected outcome from the lineage tracing
experiments is that older mice with atherosclerosis have the highest proportion of HSC-progeny in their
vasculature. In our second set of experiments for Aim 1, we will determine whether HSC inflammaging induced
by aged SSCs contributes to atherosclerosis progression. We hypothesize that 2-month HSCs transplanted
into 20-month mice become aged and their progeny then cause atherosclerotic progression in pro-atherogenic
mice fed a high fat diet. We will perform cell transplantation studies to determine whether exposure to youthful
or aged SSCs affects atherosclerotic progression. We expect that young HSCs exposed to aged SSCs will
develop HSC inflammaging and contribute to plaque progression. Finally, we will compare the proteomic and
genomic signatures of these multiple organs in humans to confirm that SSC aging also contributes to human
atherosclerosis. 2. To determine whether targeted reversal of age-related decreases in BMP2 signaling
in SSCs can alter atherosclerosis progression. We hypothesize that BMP2 infusion or application of a BMP2
infused hydrogel to aged bones creates a more balanced HSC progeny, decreasing vascular inflammation and
preventing the progression of ASCVD. We will perform a randomized, control trial of local BMP2 treatment into
the bone marrow and measure its effects on plaque size and composition."
10839863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA therapeutics hold great promise for the treatment of a number of diseases significantly impacting human
health, such as chronic infections, genetic disorders, certain cancers, and presently COVID-19. The leading RNA
delivery vehicles approved by the FDA, as well as being considered in several clinical trials, are non-viral lipid-
based nanoparticles (LNPs). State-of-the art LNPs comprise standard phospholipids, cholesterol, and ionizable
lipids (ILs) that get protonated in acidic conditions. Analogous to enveloped virus, LNPs hijack the endocytic
pathway to enter cells. The efficacy of RNA delivery hinges on the ability of LNPs to escape the endosome by
fusing with its membrane. However, the factors that control LNPs–endosome fusion remain largely unknown.
Enveloped viruses contain proteins that promote fusion by stabilizing the formation of highly curved membrane
pores. In LNPs, alternative strategies to bolster fusion include using lipids with non-zero spontaneous curvature
that are elusively deemed “fusogenic”. However, understanding membrane fusion requires the consideration of
membrane elasticity beyond spontaneous curvature. Specifically, the formation of a fusion pore between two
bilayers is dictated by an interplay between the bending modulus and the Gaussian curvature modulus. However,
the Gaussian modulus is rarely considered when designing “fusogenic” LNPs, even though bilayer fusion is an
occasion for which its value matters the most.
The central hypothesis of this work is that raising the Gaussian modulus of LNPs by inclusion of a new class of
lipids termed Gaussian curvature lipids (GCLs) has a dramatic effect on the ability of LNPs to fuse with
endosomal membranes. Furthermore, we conjecture that membrane fusion, as boosted by GCL integration, is
synergistically favored in living systems during active proton pumping and endosome acidification.
We combine a team of experts in RNA delivery to cells, membrane protein purification as well as experimental,
computational, and theoretical membrane elasticity to test the central hypotheses via two aims. In Aim 1 we will
establish the biophysical elastic properties of LNPs to maximize fusion with endosomes. We investigate how
fusion takes place at a microscopic level, namely deciphering if the dominant effect is the formation of fusion
pores and/or if LNPs feed lipids to endosomal membranes remodeling them and making them more prone to
rupture. In Aim 2 we investigate the impact of membrane activity and endosome acidification by measuring in
live cells RNA delivery and endosomal fusion of LNPs comprising increasing amounts of GCLs. We will also
develop endosome-mimetic vesicular systems reconstituted with endosomal membrane proton pumps (V-
ATPase) to elucidate the mechanism of LNP-endosomal membrane fusion during active proton pumping.
Our work will raise new physical insights on LNP endosomal escape and establish the desired LNP membrane
properties to boost fusion in living systems, resulting in substantially more effective RNA delivery vehicles."

Most mammalian retrotransposons are strictly silenced in development and physiology, yet induction of
some retrotransposons can be observed during specific developmental processes. Interestingly, a portion
of the reactivated retrotransposons, particularly LTR retrotransposons, confer a gene regulatory role, at
least in part, by acting as alternative promoters to drive chimeric transcripts with proximal protein-coding
genes. Such retrotransposon promoters frequently alter gene structure and/or gene expression, yet their
functional importance remains largely unclear.
Mammalian preimplantation embryos are an excellent experimental system to probe the functional
importance of retrotransposons. Dynamic induction of retrotransposons in preimplantation embryos have
been observed in all 8 mammalian species examined, and the global retrotransposon expression profiles
across mammalian species are similar. Using published single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse, human,
primate and livestock preimplantation embryos, we discovered hundreds of retrotransposon promoters,
which drive preimplantation-specific, proximal gene isoforms. Interestingly, most retrotransposon
sequences and integrations are species specific, yet many retrotransposon promoters yield gene
isoforms that encode evolutionarily conserved proteins. Hence, these data suggest that retrotransposon
promoters can regulate conserved protein sequences and bestow them with species-specific gene
regulation. One of such evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon driven gene isoform, Cdk2ap1N(MT2B2),
encodes an N-terminally truncated isoform for Cdk2ap1, a negative regulator for cell proliferation by
repressing Cdk2. Cdk2ap1N(MT2B2) is generated by an MT2B2 promoter, whose deletion in mice yield
reduced cell proliferation, impaired implantation and embryonic lethality. This is among the first study
demonstrating an essential function of a retrotransposon element in development. Here, we hypothesize
that retrotransposon-mediate gene regulation play an essential role in mammalian preimplantation
development. Using bioinformatics prediction combined with experimental validation, we propose to
comprehensively and accurately categorize retrotransposon-promoters in mouse, primate and livestock
preimplantation embryos, and elucidate the diverse molecular mechanisms for retrotransposon-mediated
gene regulation. Additionally, we will employ a highly efficient CRISPR technology, CRISPR-EZ, to
generate mouse deletion mutants for selected retrotransposon promoters or for the corresponding
canonical gene isoforms. We will compare the roles of retrotransposon-dependent gene isoform and the
canonical gene isoform, elucidate the molecular mechanisms of their action and explore the evolutionary
significance of such regulation. Taken together, these proposed studies will generate a comprehensive
atlas of retrotransposon-dependent gene regulation during preimplantation development, and provide a
new paradigm to investigate retrotransposon functions both computationally and experimentally."
10846676,"Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a family of resilient devastating cancers of bone and soft tissue
affecting primarily children and young adults. Current highly cytotoxic combination therapy of five drugs provides
only 30% overall survival. The aberrant transcription factor EWS-FLI1 present only in tumor cells is the oncogenic
driver of EWS. However, transcription factors were believed to be “undruggable”, until a recent NCI screening
found mithramycin (MTM) to act as a potent EWS-FLI1 antagonist. MTM has proven to be too toxic with a narrow
therapeutic window and poor pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Here we propose mechanistic and pharmacology
studies of novel MTM analogues (MTM-SA) with significantly reduced toxicity, increased target specificity and
greatly improved PK properties. In contrast to other analogues reported elsewhere, which still suffer from poor
PK properties, the MTM-SA analogs display superior kinetics and reduced toxicity. The goal of this project is to
gain molecular insights into the mode of action of MTM via structural, biochemical and pharmacological studies
to generate a highly efficacious and selective anti-ESFT treatment. To aid synthetic efforts in Aim1 and identify
analogues with clinical potential, we will perform molecular structure-function level studies in Aim 2 to determine
how transcription factor EWS-FLI1 interacts with DNA microsatellite repeats and transcription factor Runx2 (each
a necessary interaction for oncogenesis), and how these oncogenic functions are disrupted by MTM-SA. In Aim
3 will assess the in vitro cytotoxicity and target selectivity to identify analogues that will be evaluated in
pharmacologic studies that will assess toxicity in humanized liver mice, PK and metabolism, as well as efficacy
in xenograft and PDx models of Ewing Sarcoma. The project will be carried out by a team with an established
collaboration who have extensive experience in fragment-based drug design and semi-synthetic routes of natural
products, X-ray crystallographic, biophysical and molecular biology studies, and pharmacological evaluations.
We expect that these structure-function studies will identify a lead-candidate that could enter a clinical trial for
the treatment of ESFT."

contributions to human welfare through critical roles in One Health initiatives, including in global food
security and in emerging and zoonotic diseases and ecosystem health. One key area of importance is
that approximately 75% of recenUy emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are diseases of
animal origin some of which are in wildlife reservoirs. However, the US National Research Council, an
NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report, and the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure
Programs have all emphasized that the veterinarian-scientist workforce is far underrepresented and
underutilized in biomedical research. Reasons for this include limited access by veterinary students to
biomedical research programs and appropriate training. The objective of our ""Veterinary Summer
Scholars in Comparative Medicine"" T35 training program is to provide direct biomedical research
experiences to first and second-year veterinary students in order to increase the numbers of
researchers in the veterinary-scientist pipeline. Our approach will consist of 1) providing opportunities to
conduct comparative biomedical research in an environment of collaboration and discovery by mentors
who are basic and clinician-scientists, and 2) providing research training in the form of lectures,
discussions and activities focused on responsible conduct and ethics in research, experimental design
and quality assurance, conflict management, research communication, and career pathways in the
biomedical sciences. New innovations described in this renewal application include additional science
communication sessions, increased opportunities for continued research experiences during veterinary
school, as well as more interprofessional interactions by our T35 trainees with other health professionals
in the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI}, with trainees in our CVM T32
Comparative Medicine Training grant, and other similar health sciences programs to promote
team-science. The proposed T35 training program involves a critical mass of faculty mentors from our
health sciences schools (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine) at the University of
Minnesota for providing multidisciplinary and state-of-the-art research experiences."

Infants with orofacial clefts (‘cleft’) are at high risk of malnutrition. Over 5,000 infants are born with a cleft in the
United States each year. By 3 months of age an estimated 27% of these infants are underweight when
compared to World Health Organization infant growth curves (weight-for-age z-score ≤ -2). The reasons for this
are multifactorial, and involve the anatomical impact of the cleft, lack of timely clinical care with the appropriate
specialists, social determinants of health, lack of access to necessary resources (e.g., cleft bottles, breast
pumps), caregiver factors, and infant health characteristics. We do not know which infants with cleft will
develop undernutrition, which factors are most salient, how undernutrition impacts health outcomes, or how to
prevent undernutrition in this population. The purpose of this project is to address these gaps. We aim to: (1)
Predict which infants with cleft will develop undernutrition and determine associations between undernutrition
and surgical outcomes via a large clinical retrospective cohort study (N~18,000); (2) Quantify associations
between caregiver/infant factors and undernutrition, and quantify relationships between undernutrition and
adverse caregiver/infant outcomes in a prospective cohort study of caregiver/infants (N=336); and (3)
Determine the contribution of caregiver/infant factors to our clinical predictive model for undernutrition. Our
aims complement one another and provide a holistic view of infants with cleft and their experience with
undernutrition and adverse health outcomes. The retrospective cohort study in Aim 1 will leverage curated
electronic health records from PEDSnet, a consortium of U.S. children’s hospitals and a database on over 12
million children with records from 2009 to the present. The prospective cohort study in Aim 2 will include
caregiver/infant dyads and elicit caregiver/infant experiences from birth to 15 months of age. It will focus on
information not in the electronic health record. This prospective cohort study will capture factors related to
caregiver/infant feeding experiences, social determinants of health, frequency of infant infections, caregiver
stress, caregiver quality of life and more. Aim 3 is an exploratory aim in which we will combine data from
PEDSnet with data from our prospective cohort to examine caregiver/infant contributions to our clinical
predictive model developed in Aim 1. Optimal nutrition in early life is a cornerstone of infant health.
Undernutrition in US infants with cleft is unacceptably high and there is insufficient research on how to address
this issue. Our study will address this gap and is responsive to NIH/NIDCR Notice of Special Interest for data
science project in dental and craniofacial research. We will shed light on an under-investigated area in cleft
research and generate a robust, new body of evidence on undernutrition and its impact on adverse health
outcomes in cleft. Our findings will inform the development of a tailored, high impact intervention to ensure
timely growth and health of US infants with cleft."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health crisis, and persistent cognitive-affective symptoms are common
among TBI survivors. Methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) inhibitor, has demonstrated
improved outcomes with sex differences in the response. Our prior work suggests daily MPH treatment in rats
with experimental TBI helps normalize electrically evoked striatal DA, but the effect on striatal basal DA level
and the postsynaptic striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) has not been investigated. The other major striatal
input, glutamatergic cortical neurons, can contribute to TBI-induced excitotoxicity. We hypothesize ongoing
Glu-induced excitotoxicity post-TBI not only reduces tonic [DA] firing but also limits MSN outflow via
MSN damage, consequently leading to DA transmission dysfunction and cognitive-affective deficits that
are rescued by MPH. A detailed investigation of the striatum, including its inputs (DA/Glu) and output (MSN
firing) is critical to understand TBI-induced striatal damage, behavior effects, MPH mechanisms and sex differ-
ences to customize treatment for TBI patients. To enable such investigation, we will develop a multimodal mi-
croelectrode array (MEA) to monitor the rat striatum for 3 wks after TBI and MPH, and correlate MSN neural
activity, basal [DA] and [Glu] to molecular and behavioral assessments.
 Current state of art MEAs typically use one modality or assess one analyte, and suffer from chronic recording
or sensing degradations due to biofouling, inflammatory tissue reaction, or sensor/electrode material degrada-
tion. TBI exerts additional mechanical and biochemical challenges to the implanted device, and its effect on
device function is unknown. By pairing novel square wave voltammetry with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio-
phene)/acid functionalized carbon nanotube (PEDOT/CNT) coating, we have achieved basal DA sensing in vivo
for 3 wks. Meanwhile, an innovative nanoparticle technology shows promise in stabilizing Glu oxidase, allowing
for selective functionalization of individual electrode sites for Glu sensing. Additionally, flexible substrates and
antifouling coatings have independently shown benefits in the seamless tissue integration of MEAs. The goal of
this project is to take advantage of these novel technologies to build a flexible MEA that can chronically
interrogate striatal DA & Glu neurotransmission while recording striatal MSN firing, in order to advance
our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying sex-specific cognitive-affective symptoms and treatment
post-TBI. To accomplish this goal, we will 1) develop and optimize a flexible multimodal MEA for in vivo sensing
of basal [DA] and [Glu], and neural recording in naïve rats, 2) investigate TBI effects on device performance, and
3) explore striatal mechanisms of cognitive-affective symptoms after TBI and MPH treatment using recorded
striatal neural activity and basal [DA/Glu] paired with behavioral, molecular, and histological analyses to build a
holistic mechanistic picture of the striatum post TBI and treatment."

Obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet are major modifiable risk factors for cancer — a leading cause of death
among US Hispanics. US Hispanic youth have the highest rates of pediatric obesity and show faster increases
in body mass index (BMI) from age 12 to <20 years than non-Hispanic Whites. Most Hispanic adults also carry
excess weight, and Hispanic youth and adults do not often meet national guidelines for physical activity and
dietary intake. Family-based interventions can improve health outcomes in both youth and parents and are highly
relevant to Hispanics due to the cultural value of familismo (familism). However, very few existing family-based
obesity prevention interventions for Hispanics target adolescents and their parents, and those that do are not
designed to facilitate widespread reach. An underutilized approach for promoting a healthy weight status among
Hispanics is through digital (i.e., eHealth/mHealth) interventions. US Hispanics are just as likely as non-Hispanic
Whites to own a smartphone and more likely to be smartphone-only internet users. Our team employed a user-
centered approach to develop and pilot a family-based digital lifestyle intervention known as Healthy Juntos
(Healthy Together). This innovative six-month intervention (three-month intensive phase; three-month
maintenance phase), grounded in family systems and behavioral theories, is one of the few obesity prevention
interventions for Hispanic adolescents with digital delivery. It targets improvements in parent BMI and lifestyle
behaviors, family functioning, and health-related positive parenting practices as the means through which
adolescent BMI and lifestyle changes are hypothesized to occur. Unlike existing digital interventions for
adolescents, the intervention makes parents the primary agents of change, with parent-adolescent participation
a team effort through shared decision-making. Given promising findings for Healthy Juntos, the primary goal of
this study is to evaluate, in a randomized controlled trial with 375 Hispanic adolescents and their parents, the
efficacy of Healthy Juntos compared to a digital health referral to publicly available websites and apps (control)
condition in preventing increases in BMI and improving moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and diet
quality among adolescents. The aims of the study are: AIM 1: To determine whether participation in Healthy
Juntos prevents increases in BMI (primary outcome) and improves MVPA, diet quality, and percentage body fat
(%BF; secondary outcomes) in Hispanic adolescents. AIM 2: To examine whether and to what extent changes
in parent BMI and lifestyle behaviors mediate the effects of Healthy Juntos on adolescent outcomes. AIM 3: To
examine whether and to what extent family functioning and health-related positive parenting practices mediate
the effects of Healthy Juntos on adolescent outcomes. We will also explore the role of sociodemographic (e.g.,
acculturation, adolescent sex, weight status, neighborhood deprivation) and user engagement as moderators as
well as the mediating effects of individual-level constructs (e.g., self-efficacy, autonomous motivation)."
10858142,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a condition affecting 2-3% of the general populace, is typified by irregular thickening
of valve leaflets. The histopathological modifications associated with MVP are well known, yet a comprehensive
understanding of the specific molecular structures and their impact on the disease's onset remains elusive. Bulk
RNA-sequencing has been utilized to investigate gene expression in MVP, although inconsistencies between
these data and those derived from traditional IHC and RT-PCR analysis have been observed. This discrepancy
may be due to the fact that averaged expression cannot accurately portray heterogeneity across different cellular
populations. At present, the study of MVP mitral valve leaflet samples using single-cell approaches is
considerably limited. Moreover, spatial omics methodologies, capable of illustrating the spatial heterogeneity
within tissue microenvironments, have not been applied to MVP research. To address this knowledge gap, we
intend to construct a single-cell and spatial molecular atlas using mitral valve leaflet samples from both MVP
patients and healthy contributors. In-depth data analysis will enable us to elucidate the molecular underpinnings
of the disease. In this endeavor, we will focus on three specific objectives: 1) we aim to accurately identify cell
subpopulations and molecular states in MVP using single-nucleus multi-omics sequencing; 2) we plan to
characterize MVP's mitral valve tissue through spatially resolved transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic
techniques such as spatial-CITE-seq and spatial ATAC-seq; 3) we will extend our research to construct a
molecular atlas of Marfan syndrome MVP utilizing single-cell and spatial omics analysis. In sum, the molecular
data and insights gained from this research will facilitate further exploration into the diverse cell populations and
tissue microenvironment associated with MVP."
10858070,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Due to the lungs’ constant exposure to environmental irritants and airborne pathogens,
 polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) play an essential role in the pulmonary host defense system to rapidly
 respond to pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. The lungs are the organ responsible for gas exchange between
 blood and air, and the minimum functional unit, alveoli, have a characteristic structure with thin capillaries
 stretched in close proximity. This proposal is based on the postulate that these characteristic lung micro-
 environmental structures spatio-temporally regulate neutrophil plasticity during acute lung inflammatory injury.
 To support this proposal, we have developed a Computer-Vision Stabilized intravital imaging (CoVSTii) system
 for highly efficient mouse lung imaging and have quantified PMN motility and activation dynamics during acute
 inflammatory lung injury. My supporting data show that PMNs recruited into the lungs extrude their nuclei and
 become PMN cytoplasts (PMNcyts) without nuclei. Surprisingly, those cells efficiently deform their cell shape due
 to the absence of nuclei and migrate faster than normal PMNs in spatially restricted infected areas of the lung
 (PMN rapid response). During this process increased calcium influx and mitochondrial polarization, probably as
 result of cell deformation, were also directly observed. On the other hand, PMNcyt activations disappeared during
 prolonged injury condition (PMN paralysis), leading to the fundamental question of whether they can be restored
 by intervention at the molecular level. I posit that these findings are due to lung-specific PMN dynamics caused
 by the characteristic structure of the lung and that understanding this phenomena may provide an interesting
 perspective on the paradox of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is
 characterized by excessive uncontrolled PMN. In Aim 1, I will elucidate the spatio-temporal regulatory
 mechanisms of pulmonary PMN nuclear extrusion and rapid PMNcyt activation. Here, I will carry out quantitative
 lung intravital imaging to visualize PMN motility and organellar dynamics such as nucleus/mitochondria and
 signaling dynamics such as role of calcium in controlling these functions. I will focus on the involvement of Piezo1
 (mechanosensitive calcium channel present in myeloid cells) and Protein Arginine Deiminase 4 (PAD4) (a critical
 calcium dependent enzyme mediating NETosis, resulting in formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
 composing of genomic DNA and bactericidal components) pathway. I will define the role of these pathways in
 lung using dynamics imaging system/drug modulation/genetically engineered mice. In Aim 2, I will address the
 spatio-temporal regulatory mechanisms of paralyzed PMNcyts found in distal lung microvessels and ways to
 reactivate these cells. Here, I will carry out quantitative lung intravital imaging of paralyzed PMNcyts. I will focus
 on Piezo1-Hif1a (Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, a Piezo1 dependent transcriptional regulator) pathway that may
 reanimate paralyzed PMNcyts. I will also attempt re-energize paralyzed PMNcyts via mitochondrial transplantation
 and mitochondrial nutrient delivery."

This proposal concerns the broad question of how relevant information is extracted from the environment and
formatted according to animal needs. We focus on the process by which light synchronizes the circadian clock
with the solar day and thus sets appropriate patterns of physiology and gene expression throughout the body.
In mammals, this process requires neurons in the eye that sense light directly using a molecule called
melanopsin and indirectly by receiving input from retinal circuitry. These melanopsin neurons wire into the
principal circadian clock—the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain—via the retinohypothalamic pathway. We
have developed new methods of investigating this pathway ex vivo under naturalistic conditions. First is a
means of identifying melanopsin neurons that maintains their maximum photosensitivity (both intrinsic and
extrinsic). Second is an experimental preparation in which the retina and suprachiasmatic nucleus retain
functional connectivity. Using these methods, we will investigate how photic information arises in the retina and
acutely drives neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We will focus on how this process produces a
representation of the overall light intensity, which reflects the sun’s position in the sky and is used by the clock
to maintain alignment with the day/night cycle. Specifically, we will ask how retinal and suprachiasmatic
circuitry smooth away rapid fluctuations in light intensity, which tend to be uninformative for the clock (being
caused, for example, by a passing cloud or flash of lightning). We expect that this work will provide knowledge
of how neural processing is tailored to specific tasks and how environmental cues interact with internal states
according to animal needs."

 Cell metabolism regulates epigenetic reprograming to determine cellular identity and fate.
Intermediary metabolites serve as essential cofactors for epigenetic modifying enzymes. Epithelial-
mesenchymal crosstalk is critical for the maintenance of adult tissues/organs and in regenerative
responses to tissue injury. In the lung, alveolar maintenance and regeneration are orchestrated by the
interaction of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, a facultative stem/progenitor cell population, with the
adjacent mesenchyme that contributes to “niche” support of the regenerating epithelium. These
homeostatic type 2 niche-supporting stromal cells (T2NSCs) may transition to pathological
mesenchymal states/fates during lung injury-repair.
 We have identified a metabolic enzyme, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), that regulates
the plasticity of tissue-resident fibroblasts (FBs) and the transition of lipofibroblasts (lipo-FBs) into
myofibroblasts (myo-FBs). NNMT catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridine
compounds; by utilizing the universal methyl donor, SAM in this reaction, NNMT functions as a
“methyl sink” in many tissues, while also depleting cellular NAD+ levels. Our data indicate that NNMT
is upregulated in lung mesenchymal cells of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and is induced by the
pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1, in human lung fibroblasts. NNMT functions as a
critical switch from lipo-FB to myo-FB differentiation that acquire apoptosis resistance, thus impairing
fibrosis resolution.
 In this project we will test the hypothesis that metabolic-epigenetic reprogramming of activated
stromal T2NSCs by targeting NNMT potentiates lung regenerative capacity and facilitates fibrosis
resolution by augmenting cellular levels of NAD+ and/or SAM. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify
T2NSCs subpopulations and characterize their regulation by NNMT; (2) determine mechanisms by
which NNMT regulates lipo-FB to myo-FB transition; and (3) determine whether targeting NNMT
accelerates fibrosis resolution in an animal model of lung injury-induced fibrosis. A combination of
bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, metabolomics, bioenergetics, and epigenetic profiling in 3D
alveolospheres, IPF lung FBs, and an in-vivo lung injury model will be employed. The studies
proposed in this grant application will advance the field by identifying a critical regulatory switch in
lipo-FB to myo-FB differentiation, linking metabolism to epigenetics by an enzyme that controls both
cellular bioenergetics and protein methylation, defining a therapeutic strategy that achieves fibrosis
resolution/reversal in established lung fibrosis, and elucidating a functional role of alveolar stem cell
niche-supporting fibroblasts in stem cell rejuvenation and tissue regeneration."
10858227,"Chronic infections and cancer cause CD8 T cell exhaustion, a differentiation state characterized by the inability
of CD8 T cells to provide immunological protection. Improving the function of exhausted T cells (TEX) by
antagonizing checkpoint inhibitors is a potent immunotherapeutic strategy. However, most patients do not exhibit
long-term protection, creating a need for improved immunotherapeutic strategies. Resistance to immunotherapy
is mainly attributed to the inability of checkpoint inhibitors to reverse the TEX epigenome. Therefore, epigenetically
re-directing TEX differentiation to induce durable responses is key to overcoming resistance to immunotherapy.
 To date, modifying a single transcriptional pathway has had limited success in providing full TEX
reinvigoration and inducing long-term persisting immune responses. Instead, microRNAs (miRs) can have a
profound impact on the epigenetic regulation of immune cells; however, the role of miRs in TEX differentiation is
understudied. We recently identified miR-29a as a unique memory-associated miR that is repressed in TEX. We
demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-29a enhances TEX persistence, attenuates their exhaustion,
and promotes differentiation of a TEX subset with progenitor, stem-like characteristics that responds to
immunotherapy. Importantly, our preliminary data suggest that miR-29a alters the epigenetic profile of TEX and
promotes durable CD8 T cell responses, in striking contrast to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Mechanistically, we
demonstrate that miR-29a directly targets the key DNA demethylating enzyme TET2 and that TET2
overexpression abrogates key effects of miR-29a in TEX differentiation. However, the molecular circuits involving
miR-29a and TET2 and the implication of miR-29a-TET2 axis in checkpoint inhibitor therapy is unknown. The
goal of this proposal is to uncover the role of miR-29a in targeting the key epigenetic modulator TET2
and, thus, define the role of miR-29a in synergizing with checkpoint inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is
that miR-29a regulates DNA methylation by directly targeting TET2, therefore, synergizes with checkpoint
inhibitors to re-direct TEX differentiation.
Aim 1. Identify the role of the miR-29a-TET2 axis in regulating TEX differentiation. We hypothesize that miR-
29a regulates DNA demethylation, by directly targeting TET2, thereby fundamentally alters TEX differentiation.
We will elucidate the TET2-dependent versus TET2-independent effects of miR-29a in TEX differentiation and
the downstream effects in DNA methylation.
Aim 2. Identify the pathways by which miR-29a synergizes with anti-PD-L1. We hypothesize that miR-29a
epigenetically alters the differentiation of the progenitor TEX subset and, thereby, synergizes with anti-PD-L1 to
promote durable TEX reinvigoration. We will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of synergy between miR-29a
and anti-PD-L1 and we will define the TET2-dependent and TET2-independent roles of miR-29a in synergizing
with anti-PD-L1 in mouse models of LCMV and B16 melanoma."

About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly
diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV
Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and
1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV,
alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall
HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately
3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The
highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals
anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents.
Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group
of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on
understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and
failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to
achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to
decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong
collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation,
participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort
to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic
suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and
prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated
mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of
microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary
antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term
goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from
seroconverting."

The recently proposed Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative includes four pillars: Diagnose, Treat, Protect,
and Respond. Research that involves the “Respond” pillar of the EHE Initiative may be associated with barriers
not observed with the other three EHE pillars, due to a set of associated scientific, ethical, legal and social
challenges. The success of EHE research applications will be contingent upon carefully addressing the
implementation challenges of this prevention strategy. This proposal will take the innovative leap of addressing
the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of an array of potential ME-informed HIV prevention efforts
developed by simulations, parameterized using real-world data, and incorporating current and emerging
technological and analytic approaches. These quantitative estimates will inform our efforts to understand the
ethical, legal, and social issues related to ME, as well as guide policy development to attenuate concerns related
to them. The proposed study, “Perspectives Among Key Populations of the Risks and Benefits of Molecular
Epidemiology for HIV Prevention (HIV-ME)” will engage a national population of persons living with HIV (PLWH)
and persons at risk without HIV (PWoH) in a multi-method examination of the ELSI of ME-informed inferences
(i.e., identification of individuals with genetically linked HIV sequences) to facilitate successful implementation of
ME-guided HIV prevention research. Key populations, including men who have sex with men, transgender
women, and persons who inject drugs in geographic areas prioritized by the EHE initiative will be included.
Quantitative and qualitative methods will be informed by well-characterized estimates of benefit (e.g., improved
risk stratification by molecular surveillance) and risk (e.g., inferred directionality of transmission and false
identification) derived from simulations of a well characterized U.S. HIV epidemic. To date, there has not been a
comprehensive effort to provide quantitative estimates of the actual risks and benefits associated with ME-
informed HIV prevention interventions among PLWH and PWoH in the U.S. and there has been no large-scale
engagement of key populations to determine how these risks and benefits are perceived. Furthermore, no
previous studies focus on high HIV burden jurisdictions.
Our overarching goal is to gauge the acceptability of ME approaches for HIV prevention research among key
populations of PLWH and PWoH across the US, informed by well-characterized estimates of the risks and
benefits. We will identify the facilitators and barriers that may impact those most affected by HIV-ME and develop
guidance to improve acceptability of ME guided HIV prevention research. To do so we will address the following
Specific Aims: 1) AIM 1 - Identify the perceived ethical, legal and social risks of molecular epidemiology for HIV
prevention; 2) AIM 2 - Estimate the measurable scientific benefits and risks of molecular epidemiology; and 3)
AIM 3 - Develop points to consider and guidance for designing and implementing research involving molecular
epidemiology-informed approaches to HIV prevention."

Interactions between long noncoding RNAs and epigenetic complexes are now increasingly recognized as
important regulators of developmental decisions. A classic example is X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), an
epigenetic process by which one X-chromosome becomes inactivated in the early embryo. XCI can take
place randomly or in an imprinted manner on the paternal X. In the mouse, random XCI is observed in the
embryo proper (soma), and imprinted XCI in the placenta. Both require the ‘X-inactivation center’ (Xic), an
X-linked region that harbors several essential noncoding genes. A key gene is Xist, which produces a
noncoding RNA that ‘paints’ the X-chromosome and recruits silencing factors in cis. Our work has shown
that, during random XCI, Xist is regulated both positively and negatively by Xic factors, with Jpx in the
positive pathway and Tsix/Xite in the negative pathway. We have also shown that homologous X-
chromosome pairing coordinates which X chromosome will be inactivated. In this funding cycle, we have
further advanced understanding of the Xic’s role in X-chromosome counting, allelic choice, and imprinting.
For the counting mechanism, Jpx RNA — an Xist activator — serves as an X-linked “numerator” by titrating
the autosomal “denominator”, CTCF. This titration accounts for the X-to-autosome (X:A) ratio and creates a
permissive state for Xist induction. We also learned that X-X pairing requires a new long noncoding RNA
called “PAR-TERRA” produced from the X-linked pseudoautosomal region (PAR). Interestingly, all pairing
interactions take place within a “tetrad” of two Xic’s and two PAR’s. X-X pairing is then resolved by mRNA
decapping enzyme, DCP1A. For imprinted XCI, we have generated an ex vivo cellular model to study XP
imprinting. We have demonstrated that a 200-kb Xic region is sufficient to direct Xist imprinting and that Xist
imprinting requires an unpaired state in the male germ line that is akin to meiotic sex chromosome
inactivation (MSCI). Our research has generated new opportunities and many additional mechanistic
questions. In the next funding cycle, we aim to (i) investigate mechanisms underlying X-X pairing and
breaking of X-chromosome symmetry, (ii) determine how Jpx-CTCF titration regulates the initiation of XCI,
and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms of imprinted XCI. The proposed work will require five years to complete
and is expected to train three postdoctoral fellows for academic careers in the fields of epigenetics and RNA
biology."

No targeted therapies exist for treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as the underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. Recent studies implicate the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of ASD, and we have
recently shown that cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to generate ASD-relevant behaviors. However, the
contribution of cerebellar dysfunction to these behaviors in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is unknown.
FXS is the most significant monogenic cause of ASD, and cerebellar dysfunction has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of both ASD and FXS. Previous studies have demonstrated important roles for Fmr1 in the
cerebellum – from dendritic morphology to synaptic plasticity; however, the contribution of cerebellar
dysfunction to autism-relevant behaviors in FXS remains unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize and
present preliminary data to support that cerebellar Fmr1 dysfunction is sufficient to generate ASD behaviors,
including social dysfunction and sensory hypersensitivity. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose in Aim1 to
establish the role for Purkinje cell Fmr1 in the regulation of ASD-relevant behaviors and to further evaluate
electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms that are disrupted upon loss of cerebellar Fmr1.
With evidence that cerebellar dysfunction contributes to ASD behaviors, we also hypothesized and have
generated preliminary data to support specific cerebellar lobule CrusI involvement in ASD-related behaviors
and circuit connections between this lobule and the parietal association cortex, a region implicated in ASD and
in sensory processing. In Aim2, we will delineate the involvement of right CrusI – parietal association cortex
circuits in ASD-relevant behaviors and investigate the impact of circuit modulation on ASD-relevant behaviors
and cortical hyper-excitability in the cerebellar FXS mouse model.
Lastly, we also hypothesize and show preliminary data to support that normalization of cerebellar function
might itself be sufficient to ameliorate ASD-related behaviors in a global (whole body knockout) model of FXS.
In Aim3, we will delineate the benefit of reintroduction of Fmr1 specifically into the cerebellum in an otherwise
global Fmr1 mutant mouse. In addition, we will further evaluate the potential benefit of cerebellar
neuromodulation in this global Fmr1 mutant mouse model on behavior and cortical hyper-excitability.
Taken together, in this proposal, we will establish the roles for Fmr1 in the cerebellum and establish its
contribution to autism-related behaviors. We will additionally examine the molecular mechanisms driving these
contributions and examine the benefits of reintroduction of Fmr1 within the cerebellum in an otherwise global
Fmr1 mutant. Lastly, we will examine the benefit of cerebellar neuromodulation on ASD-relevant behaviors in
cerebellar and global FXS mouse models. Thus, these studies will not only further our understanding of basic
molecular and circuit mechanisms of ASD-relevant behaviors in FXS but will also shed light on potential circuit
and molecular targets for therapy for FXS."

and cortical hyper-excitability in the cerebellar FXS mouse model.
Lastly, we also hypothesize and show preliminary data to support that normalization of cerebellar function
might itself be sufficient to ameliorate ASD-related behaviors in a global (whole body knockout) model of FXS.
In Aim3, we will delineate the benefit of reintroduction of Fmr1 specifically into the cerebellum in an otherwise
global Fmr1 mutant mouse. In addition, we will further evaluate the potential benefit of cerebellar
neuromodulation in this global Fmr1 mutant mouse model on behavior and cortical hyper-excitability.
Taken together, in this proposal, we will establish the roles for Fmr1 in the cerebellum and establish its
contribution to autism-related behaviors. We will additionally examine the molecular mechanisms driving these
contributions and examine the benefits of reintroduction of Fmr1 within the cerebellum in an otherwise global
Fmr1 mutant. Lastly, we will examine the benefit of cerebellar neuromodulation on ASD-relevant behaviors in
cerebellar and global FXS mouse models. Thus, these studies will not only further our understanding of basic
molecular and circuit mechanisms of ASD-relevant behaviors in FXS but will also shed light on potential circuit
and molecular targets for therapy for FXS."

The mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes represent a family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes (CRCs) that play critical roles in the maintenance of chromatin accessibility and gene expression.
Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are combinatorically assembled from 29 different gene products to generate
three distinct 11-15-subunit classes termed BAF, pBAF, and ncBAF complexes. Importantly, mSWI/SNF genes
are mutated in over 20% of human cancers, underscoring their critical roles in oncogenesis. While biochemical,
structural and genomics-based studies over the past several years have begun to define subunit-specific
contributions to overall protein complex function, most subunit functions remain unassigned. BCL7 is a recently-
discovered component of all three SWI/SNF complex classes. Despite other mSWI/SNF complex subunits being
conserved throughout evolution, BCL7 has only recently emerged in higher-order organisms, suggesting it may
be necessary for specialized organismal processes such as mammalian cell differentiation or immune system
development. I aim to define the role of the BCL7 subunit in mSWI/SNF complex function in the human cell
context.
I hypothesize that BCL7 is required for a) SWI/SNF complex biochemical integrity; and b) for genome-wide
SWI/SNF targeting and DNA accessibility generation in lymphoma and primary B cells. The role of the
mammalian-specific BCL7 subunit in the biochemical composition, targeting, and activity of SWI/SNF complexes
remains unknown. First, I aim to determine the impact of BCL7 deletion on SWI/SNF complex biochemical
integrity (subunit assembly and stability) and to define the region of BCL7 required for its incorporation into
SWI/SNF complexes. BCL7 mutations, including deletions and single-residue substitutions, have been identified
primarily in lymphomas and myelomas, cancer subtypes that affect B cell maturation and function. Second, I aim
to determine the impact of BCL7 perturbations on the SWI/SNF complex genomic targeting, DNA accessibility
generation, and subsequent gene expression in B cell lymphomas such as DLBCL. Third, I aim to determine the
functional impact and role of BCL7 in SWI/SNF complex genomic targeting and accessibility generation in
healthy human primary B cells.
This research will elucidate key features of BCL7-mediated SWI/SNF complex composition, chromatin
localization, and resulting DNA accessibility, and gene expression programs in normal and malignant B cells.
The mechanisms governing chromatin remodeling complex activities during basic cellular processes and in
human disease remain incompletely understood, and with the highly frequent mutations in these processes
observed in human cancers, this is a uniquely pertinent and high-impact priority for the field at-large."

One of the main bottlenecks to therapeutic development is the rapid synthesis of complex
organic molecules to evaluate for bioactivity. One of the best means of accomplishing the
discovery of the next generation of therapeutics is the late stage functionalization (LSF) of lead
structures, such that key properties (KD, log P, PK, PD, etc) are optimized along specific growth
vectors of the core structure. Consequently, synthetic methodologies that are able to modify
complex target molecules at specific aliphatic and aromatic sites either through C–H or C–O
bond functionalization are ideal so as to avoid de novo synthesis of the target of interest. The
aim of this MIRA grant is to merge two productive NIGMS-funded projects that broadly seek to
develop new catalytic chemical transformations for immediate use in the biomedical community
for rapid derivatization of complex organic molecules. More specifically, we aim to develop new
catalytic methods for functionalization of aliphatic C–H bonds and aromatic C–O bonds by
activation of organic substrates using potent single electron organic photooxidants. We envision
that activation of typically unreactive C–H bonds can be accomplished via the catalytic
generation of heteroatom radical species that is capable of selective H-atom abstraction. The
resultant radicals can engage in a number of radical group transfer reactions including
conjugate addition, halogenation, azidation and thiotrifluoromethylation. We aim to target
unreactive primary and secondary C–H bonds by modification of the heteroatom-centered
radical species. Importantly, enantioselective variants of the radical reactions herein will be
explored, as few reactions of this type are known. Further elaboration of these radical
transformations will allow for cascade-type reactions wherein complex chiral building blocks can
be forged without the need for prefunctionalization of the starting materials. Opportunities to
utilize some of these radical transformations in cascade sequences for natural product synthesis
will be exploited, as in the case of stemocurtisine, a member of the stemona alkaloid family. We
also will continue a program aimed at aromatic C–H and C–O bond functionalization. A novel
method for catalysis of the venerable nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction using
alkoxyarenes as substrates will allow for direct substitution by amines, cyanide, fluoride and
azoles with the alkoxide acting as the nucleofuge. These newly developed transformations will
enable synthetic practitioners with new tools for complex molecule synthesis aimed at
therapeutic discovery."
10834024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dopamine (DA) signaling in the ventral striatum has received considerable attention for its role in relapse and
drug craving, both in rodent models of addiction and in humans. A popular belief is that dopamine neurons in
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) communicate a prediction error to the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc),
where the error reports the difference between observed and expected values of cues and rewards. A critical
assumption is that prediction errors are based on values, and this idea has been used to explain how drugs of
abuse exert their reinforcing effects by hijacking DA-mediated value learning. However, in most studies that
measure DA cell activity and neurotransmitter release, value is confounded with another variable critical for
learning: mutual information, or the degree to which cues in the environment signal relative changes in reward
rate. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to investigate the extent to which an information-theoretic
account of learning can be captured by mesostriatal DA dynamics. Behavioral manipulations will utilize
established methods of inducing changes in mutual information between cues and rewards independent of
value during Pavlovian conditioning in rats. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will use fiber photometry to assess
whether bulk activity in VTA DA neurons and DA release in the NAcc encode prediction errors based on
mutual information, and whether cue-evoked responses in NAcc neurons scales with mutual information. Aim 2
will determine whether conditioned behavior will diminish when degrading mutual information between cues
and optogenetic DA stimulation in either VTA cell bodies or VTA axon terminals in the NAcc. Experiments in
Aim 3 will assess whether optogenetically inhibiting VTA DA neurons that project to the NAcc during moments
of Pavlovian information loss will rescue conditioned behavior from dissipating, and whether stimulating cue-
sensitive ensembles of NAcc neurons at the onset of information-degraded cues will also have the same effect."
10834277,"Project Summary
Mood and anxiety disorders are common and highly comorbid conditions with peak incidence in emerging
adulthood (~ages 18-23). Developmental psychopathology models suggest that vulnerability to internalizing
disorders in emerging adults is driven by interactions between still maturing self-regulatory abilities (as
executive function [EF] continues to mature into young adulthood), and individual differences in reward and
threat sensitivity. Together, this highlights the importance of complex neurocognitive profiles consisting of
abnormalities across these three RDoC constructs for internalizing disorders. However, prior research has
largely investigated these constructs individually, in relation to individual disorders or symptom dimensions.
Given the high co-occurrence and complex multi-causality of internalizing psychopathology, the critical next step
is to build a framework for understanding how these neurocognitive dimensions interact to predict
transdiagnostic person-specific symptom trajectories. The proposed study aims to advance this precision
medicine goal, by evaluating how the neurocognitive dimensions of EF, reward and threat sensitivity interact to
produce risk phenotypes; and by using machine learning techniques to identify the most parsimonious set of risk
markers (across units of analysis) that forecast psychopathology. This longitudinal study will recruit a final
sample of 480 emerging adults during the transition to college, when stress and psychopathology risk increase,
to test risk pathways for transdiagnostic (common across internalizing symptoms) and specific (anhedonia,
anxious arousal, mania) internalizing dimensions, using a methodologically rigorous latent variable approach.
Our first aim is to test interactions among the neurocognitive dimensions of executive function, threat sensitivity
and reward sensitivity as risk mechanisms for transdiagnostic and specific internalizing symptom profiles and
trajectories. We hypothesize that poor EF is a transdiagnostic risk factor, with specific symptom profile
depending on threat (contributing to anxious arousal) and reward (contributing to anhedonia or mania)
sensitivity, and different maladaptive behaviors (e.g., social withdrawal vs. risky behavior). Our second aim is to
perform automated risk profiling, using machine learning to determine most parsimonious set of units that
predict outcome– a key objective for future clinical translation for screening for internalizing psychopathology
risk. Strengths of this approach include model-driven dimensional constructs of cognitive control, negative and
positive valence, spanning units of analysis (physiology, behavior, self-report) at a critical developmental risk
period. The robust sample size enables a rigorous statistical modeling approach and testing of moderating
influences (e.g., sex). By elucidating interactions between neurocognitive risks and the specific biobehavioral
mechanisms involved, we can make a novel impact that will be critical for developing translational tools that
predict person-specific symptom trajectories, informing future diagnostic systems (RDoC priority) and
personalizing promising interventions (which risk mechanisms to target for intervention, and for whom)."
10845568,"ABSTRACT
Many harmful environmental exposures humans experience, such as UV radiation, air pollutants, and exposure
to arsenic compounds, lead to oxidative stress from the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
cell. A vast array of disease progression results from oxidative stress, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and
atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease. In response to oxidative stress, humans rewire cellular processes
at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level. A central aspect of this response includes the
ubiquitin modification, as its global accumulation during oxidative stress is essential for cell survival. These roles
that promote cellular defense include proteasome degradation, autophagy, translational control, and antioxidant
protein production. However, many roles of the ubiquitination in the context of oxidative stress remain
unexplored. My sponsor’s laboratory has begun to uncover new roles for ubiquitination under oxidative stress,
such as how mutations preventing specific K63 ubiquitin linkages increase sensitivity to oxidative stress in yeast.
Additionally, recent unpublished findings highlight an accumulation of K63 ubiquitin at the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) under oxidative stress in mammalian cells, which is likely to modify ribosomes. This proposal aims to
characterize vital roles of the ubiquitin modification within the oxidative stress response in humans, in my first
aim by defining the outcome of this localized K63 accumulation, and in my second aim by defining vital roles for
ubiquitin enzymes in cell viability through use of a pooled CRISPR loss-of-function screen. For aim one, I will
first test the impact of DUB activity, autophagy and proteasome degradation on removing ER K63 ubiquitin during
stress recovery by western blot and immunofluorescence. If related to DUB activity, which is my leading
hypothesis, I will then use siRNAs to identify a specific ER-resident DUB from a candidate list whose depletion
prevents recovery, then determine how redox levels regulates the DUBs through in vitro and in vivo studies. For
aim two, I will use sgRNA libraries to target 40/40 E2s, 512/~600 E3s, and 90/102 DUBs to identify candidate
enzymes whose sgRNAs become underrepresented under higher ROS levels. Once identified, I will then define
the roles of the most underrepresented enzyme by identifying its stress-associated targets of ubiquitination, as
well as how oxidation regulates its function. Deeper understanding of ubiquitin’s role in the basic mechanisms of
oxidative stress response pathways will inform clinical strategies to mitigate disease progression under ROS
accumulation. This proposal will ultimately support my training to become an independent physician-scientist.
My training plan includes presenting my findings of this work at multiple conferences, and structured interactions
with my mentoring team. With the support of this F30, I will develop the required skill set to successfully transition
to my post-doctoral and residency training."

qualified, independent investigators, clinically trained in obstetrics and gynecology, to conduct
innovative and significant women’s health research. In the past 5 years, the Department of
Gynecology and Obstetrics has made a significant investment in clinical and translational
research under the leadership of the PI, Dr. Andrew Satin. The opportunities for research training
have increased with the expansion of NIH-funded translational and clinical research programs. In
addition, the Department has established a successful program to support faculty development.
Departmental initiatives include a seminar series to promote academic career development, a
grant writing course and workshop, and new resources for statistical support. Within the
Department, collaborative discovery/scholarship has been fueled via the addition of both senior
and mid-career faculty conducting research. In addition to Departmental resources, the leadership
and faculty across Hopkins Schools of Medicine, and Public Health are committed to the JH-
WRHR program. Evidence of the success of these interventions include new K awards for Gyn/Ob
faculty as well as the increase in NIH-funded research across the Department. The JH-WRHR
program will build on this success by: 1) recruiting promising and highly motivated junior faculty
nationally, with priority given to groups underrepresented in research; 2) using a learner-centered,
competency-based approach to career development under mentorship of nationally recognized,
leaders in the specialty; and 3) developing independent, ethical women’s health research leaders.
During their mentored research, WRHR Scholars will gain critical skills necessary for a research
career in the specialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The JH-WRHR program core strength areas
include: 1) clinical and outcomes research across the specialty, integrated with other programs in
the Schools of Medicine and Public Health; 2) a Departmental clinical research core with
dedicated support staff for data management and outcomes research; 3) clinical and translational
research opportunities within five NIH-funded laboratories; and 4) translational research
opportunities in related disciplines within the School of Medicine (e.g. immunology, neuroscience,
cardiovascular and genetics). All Scholars will have 75 percent-protected research effort and pilot
research funding over two years, with additional support as needed. The Department has
demonstrated success and commitment to transforming promising scholars into independently
funded investigators who will help advance and elevate the care of women through research."
10845575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application investigates the relationship between obesity, senescence, brain aging and the
development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cellular senescence is a well-established driver of
tissue and organismal aging, a process thought to be partly mediated via the induction of a
chronic Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consequently, there is great
interest in selectively targeting senescent cells as a strategy to promote healthy aging. We have
found that senescent markers accumulated in glia cells and neurons in different brain regions of
obese and aged mice. Importantly, we showed that clearance of senescent cells, using both
genetic and pharmacological approaches, restored neurogenesis and significantly decreased
obesity-induced anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, we found that senescent cells were a
contributor to the accumulation of fat deposits in the brain, a phenotype common between
aging, obesity and AD. This led us to hypothesize that obesity, by inducing senescence in the
brain, exacerbates age-related cognitive decline and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases
such as AD.
In order to test our hypothesis, we will use innovative mouse models which allow the elimination
of either p21Cip1 or p16Ink4a positive senescent cells (p21-ATTAC and INK-ATTAC), as well as a
novel transgenic model LOX-ATTAC (which we will cross with different Cre-expressing mice)
allowing us to clear p16Ink4a senescent cells specifically in neurons, microglia and astrocytes.
Using these models, we will be able to elucidate the functional impact of senescent cell
clearance during aging and obesity, in particular, the relative contribution of different cell-types
(aim1). Additionally, we will examine the mechanisms mediating impaired lipid metabolism
during senescence in particular the role of lipid import, lipogenesis and β-oxidation to cellular
senescence by using a combination of genetic and imaging approaches as well as mass
spectrometry lipidomics studies. Finally, we will investigate if diet-induced obesity in mouse
models of AD exacerbates neurodegeneration via increased cellular senescence as well as the
impact of removal of senescent cells to the pathology of AD during obesity.
Our ultimate goal is to identify new interventions that target senescent cells to alleviate cognitive
decline during aging and AD."
10832063,"The overall vision of our NIGMS-supported program is to address the molecular mechanisms of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signal transmission as guided by scaffold proteins.
Essential for the normal functioning of the cell, the ERK1/2 ability to “rewire” signaling pathways is a major
problem for clinical intervention. The rationale for the proposed studies is that a thorough understanding of the
mechanism by which key regulators, such as scaffold protein Shoc2, modify ERK1/2 signaling is essential for
understanding dysregulated mechanisms in ERK1/2-related diseases and for identifying new drug targets. Our
studies have raised many exciting questions, and the most transformative research will be pursued in the next
five-year period.
 Our efforts during the first cycle of NIGMS funding led to the discovery that the ubiquitin machinery
regulates the signal transmission of ERK1/2 signals through the Shoc2 scaffolding module and controls
assembly of the proteins in the complex. We identified key enzymes modulating the ability of Shoc2 to transmit
ERK1/2 signals. We then discovered that organized spatial distribution of the Shoc2 complexes is critical for
the proper transmission of ERK1/2 signals. Our work further revealed a distinct function of the signals
transduced by the Shoc2 scaffold in ERK1/2 in mediating cell adhesion and motility. We also established that
loss of Shoc2 in zebrafish has a systemic effect of on early development recapitulating congenital
malformations observed in patients with Shoc2 mutations.
 For MIRA application, we propose to define the mechanisms by which endosomal sorting regulates the
ubiquitin-driven remodeling of the Shoc2 complexes and signaling. The key steps that segregate Shoc2 into
the distinct intracellular sorting pathways will be delineated. The molecular details of how Shoc2-activated
ERK1/2 signals promote early developmental stages will be determined. We will use an innovative
comprehensive approach encompassing genetic, state-of-the-art microscopy, as well as cell-based and
biophysical methodologies. Of note, we will use zebrafish as a vertebrate model to investigate the in vivo effect
of Shoc2 gene editing on the early stages of development since they offer distinct advantages for studies of
development, including their transparency, as well as external and rapid development. The proposed research
is expected to produce an ambitious and comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how Shoc2 is involved
in determining the specificity of ERK1/2 signaling outcomes, and has the potential for high impact by laying the
groundwork for future studies on developmental disorders and contributing to the advancement of novel
therapeutic strategies and biomarkers."
10832064,"Bacterial viruses, known as bacteriophages or phages, are among the most abundant biological entities on the
planet. These viruses vary broadly in terms of genome content, infection mechanisms, replication cycles, and
structure. With an increasing interest in using bacteriophages to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, it is
necessary to understand mechanisms of how these viruses infect their hosts; replicate and regulate both their
genes and their hosts’ genes; and how they persist in various environments, including the human body and/or
storage conditions. However, our current model systems inherently only represent a fraction of bacteriophage
diversity. The long-term goal of this work is to develop an additional bacteriophage system—the Moogleviruses—
that appear to be ubiquitous in the environment and clinically useful qualities. They have, however, only recently
been isolated because they do not commonly infect the model species of bacteria Escherichia coli and
Salmonella enterica. Instead, these viruses are often isolated against the pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri
or opportunistic pathogens such as Citrobacter freundii. Because these viruses are obligately lytic and specific
to one of the most common etiological agents of diarrhea, S. flexneri, they could be used for controlling this
species of bacteria in food or water, or for treating antibiotic-resistant infections. At this time, however, we lack
sufficient understanding of their biological processes. Moogleviruses have distinct characteristics versus other
bacteriophages, including a semi-specific host range, a large number of tRNAs encoded in their genomes, and
uncommon capsid and genome sizes. The central hypothesis of this work is that these viruses use alternative
strategies to infect and persist compared to more thoroughly characterized model systems. The objectives of
this specific proposal are therefore to determine the mechanisms Shigella-infecting Moogleviruses use to identify
their hosts, modulate the expression of viral and host genes on a translational level, and assemble into new
particles that can persist in the environment. The expected outcomes of this proposal are: 1) the identification of
critical interacting regions between the phage receptor-binding proteins and both primary and secondary
receptors on the S. flexneri host, along with determining the kinetics of attachment and entry; 2) complete Ribo-
seq and RNA-seq datasets from a variety of environments and infection conditions, leading to a mechanistic
understanding of how phage infection alters translational efficiency of phage and host genes; and 3) a broadly
resolved assembly pathway of the Mooglevirus capsid, with an indication of proteins or protein domains
responsible for affecting capsid stability. This work will have impacts for both basic biology, expanding our
repertoire of known bacteriophage strategies and mechanisms for infection and persistence; and medical
application, informing how these phages themselves could be applied to combat S. flexneri infections in the
clinic, or how their properties could be used to engineer novel phages for medical or industrial applications."
10832070,"Project Summary
The goal of this research is to enable the integration of advanced polarimetric imaging into existing optical
coherence tomography (OCT) hardware and expedite its clinical translation. OCT is essential in contemporary
ophthalmology and is routinely used to guide percutaneous coronary interventions. Extending OCT to measure
polarization effects arising from tissue anisotropy affords contrast between tissues that are indiscernible in
OCT’s conventional scattering signal. Polarization provides insight into the make-up and physical orientation of
tissue microstructure beyond the spatial resolution of OCT. Intravascular polarimetry with polarization-sensitive
(PS)-OCT offers refined insight into coronary atherosclerosis in patients suffering from myocardial infarction
and other coronary syndromes and may improve patient management and guidance of percutaneous
interventions. In the eye, PS-OCT has shown promise to detect alterations of the retinal nerve fiber layer
(RNFL) that precede the degeneration of its retinal ganglion cell axons encountered in glaucoma, the leading
cause of irreversible blindness. However, the dissemination of PS-OCT relies on adoption by a wider
community, which has been hindered by the excessive hardware complexity of conventional PS-OCT.
This project develops a universal and robust signal processing framework for optical coherence polarimetry
(OCP) that accommodates novel simplified hardware implementations. Coherent measurements of the
polarization response to propagation through tissue conventionally require polarization-diverse detection and
illumination with two input states. To avoid the acute complexity of multiplexing two input states, prototype PS-
OCT systems currently employed for imaging the coronary arteries or the lung use sequential input modulation.
Still, this remains incompatible with the substantial commercial OCT instrument infrastructure available in the
clinic today. OCP capitalizes on an intrinsic symmetry constraint manifesting in round-trip measurements
performed with OCT, which enables the recovery of polarization effects from previously ill-conditioned
configurations and enables adaptation of existing commercial OCT instruments to perform advanced tissue
polarimetry. Aim 1 integrates concepts from magnetic resonance image reconstruction into OCP to
compensate for detrimental system effects and suppress speckle-induced polarization noise. Aim 2 adapts
OCP to commercial clinical intravascular OCT instruments using a single, spectrally varying input state and
polarization diverse detection for investigating plaque rupture and healing in patients. Aim 3 performs OCP with
retinal OCT instruments using a single spectrometer, relying on a rotating waveplate module, fitted into the
accessible round-trip path and repeated scan patterns established for OCT angiography. RNFL birefringence
will be investigated with the adapted clinical instruments in glaucoma patients and healthy controls.
Combined, this work will provide the clinical OCT imaging community with a toolbox of algorithms that
transforms existing OCT instruments with minimal modification into powerful polarimetric imaging platforms."
10832682,"The effects of cannabinoids are diverse and dose dependent. For instance, low doses produce anxiolysis
whereas high doses induce anxiety; similar effects have been seen on memory and cognition. However, the
reasons for this are not clear. At the synapse level, the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is known to impact
transmitter release through inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels, including the N-type (CaV2.2) channels
that are paramount in coupling neuronal activity to transmitter release in the hippocampus (HPC). This brain
area is important for emotional processing and learning, and CaV2.2 channels are essential in one of the best-studied circuits in the brain. Our long-term goal is to decipher the regulation and function of CaV2.2 channels at
specific HPC synapses to inform basic mechanisms of HPC activity, and enable novel therapies based on CB1R
signaling.
Alternative splicing is a cell-specific mechanism that impacts the function and regulation of CaV2.2 channels.
Splicing of exon 18a generates the +18a-CaV2.2 and D18a-CaV2.2 splice variants. Neurotransmission in
synapses that express +18a-CaV2.2 variants exhibit enhanced probability of transmitter release, and reduced
modulation by CB1R agonists compared to those that express the +18a-CaV2.2 variants, but the underlying
mechanisms are unknown. +18-CaV2.2 splice variants contain a 21 aminoacid insertion in the region that
interacts with the release machinery. Our central hypothesis is +18a-CaV2.2 splice variants enhance transmitter
release and prevent CB1R inhibition of neurotransmission via differential interaction with SNARE proteins. To
test this, we will use validated mouse models with restricted splice choice (+18a-only or 18a-only) and
recombinase-based labeling of specific neurons in HPC for electrophysiology in acute slices, and biochemical
assays to evaluate protein interaction. The specific aims of the project are: 1) To determine the functional impact
of +18a-CaV2.2 and D18a-CaV2.2 splice variants on transmitter release in HPC, and 2) To determine the role of
+18a-CaV2.2 and D18a-CaV2.2 splice variants on CB1R modulation of transmitter release in HPC. The results of
this project are expected to provide insights into the basic mechanisms underlying hippocampal function, as well
for the contradictory effects of cannabinoids. Novel cell-specific effectors of CB1R signaling could positively
impact development of cannabinoid-based therapeutics"

 Efforts to transform medicine from a reactionary, trial-and-error endeavor to an anticipatory, evidence-
based endeavor referred to as “precision medicine” have been underway for several years. Concurrently,
efforts also were undertaken to promote patient-centered “learning healthcare systems” (in which scientific
research informs the delivery of healthcare and healthcare influences research) and to modernize the
applicable ethical, legal, and regulatory frameworks in order to accelerate biomedical innovations. Novel
biomedical technologies (including AI-driven robotic surgical technologies, bionic technologies such as the
artificial pancreas systems for type 1 diabetes, and bioprinting of organs such as hearts) are advancing rapidly.
Yet there are a wide range of ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) that remain under-examined and call
into question whether existing laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines are adequate for ensuring that these
technologies are safe, effective, equitable, and privacy-preserving (while not unethically or unlawfully
obstructing patient access to their own health information or hampering the research, development, and
realization of the full potential of “mix and match” biomedical technologies tailored to each individual's needs
and preferences).
 In this exploratory project, we seek to examine the data practices, data privacy, data access, and data
justice issues (Aim 1); examine regulatory pathways and identify regulatory gaps (Aim 2); and examine liability
risks (Aim 3) related to the development and use of three technologies in healthcare: robotics, bionics, and
bioprinting. To do so, we will rely upon an innovative combination of bioethical, legal, and anthropological
approaches involving key informant interviews with scientists/engineers and lawyers, internet research of
technology developers' website disclosures, normative bioethics and comparative legal research (comparing
the US and EU regulatory frameworks), and legal research of emerging case law in four areas: products
liability, medical malpractice liability, organizational liability, and intellectual property infringement. This
approach could identify similarities and differences among the three technologies and also identify gaps in
perceived and actual liability risks.
 The successful completion of this project would provide important insights that would not only lay a
solid empirical foundation for subsequent empirical and normative ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI)
research regarding robotics, bionics, and bioprinting but also provide important insights to inform the
development, and refinement of educational materials, engineering standards, research and clinical practice
guidance, and institutional and public policies and procedures to help ensure the technologies' ethical and
responsible use in precision medicine."

Due to the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) are now
experiencing life expectancies similar to those of people without HIV (PwoH), and accordingly
living into older ages. Numerous aging-related diseases are now occurring in PLWH and there is
abundant evidence that these occur at earlier ages (chronologically) than in the general
population or in demographically similar PwoH. This earlier occurrence has posed a major
problem in the clinical care of PLWH- both in understanding what the optimal care is, and in
providing clinical settings in which it can be delivered. These are major problems worldwide, but
especially in resource-limited settings. While large meetings are important venues for scientific
exchange regarding the latest knowledge concerning the care of PLWH as they age, there is a
compelling need for smaller meetings that facilitate the personal discussions and networking that
are critical to effective dissemination of advances and to the career development of early-stage
investigators in the field of HIV and aging. The International Workshop on HIV & Aging has
addressed this important need annually since 2010, bringing together 150-200 international
delegates to discuss the latest findings and controversies in the biology of aging as it is affected
by HIV and in methods for incorporating these into the delivery of clinical care to often challenging
populations. The Workshop has traditionally been held in one site over two days (although this
went to a 3-day virtual format because of the COVID-19 pandemic), with expert plenary speakers
either from pertinent areas outside of HIV research or performing research or care on PLWH, and
oral and poster presentations based on submitted abstracts. Also included are interactive panel
discussions with audience involvement; short talks dealing with topical issues in these areas, and
guided tours of related posters. Researchers receive ample feedback and evaluation on their
work. This R13 application proposes the following aims to enhance the 14th International
Workshop on HIV & Aging, which will be held on Oct. 26-27, 2023 in Washington, DC, USA:
1) To provide scholarships to trainees and investigators who need financial support in
order to attend the Workshop, especially those from resource-limited settings; and 2) To
provide support for experts from resource-limited settings to give plenary lectures at the
Workshop. Funding of this application will greatly enhance the diversity and geographic reach of
the attendance at the Workshop, which in turn will facilitate dissemination of expertise and
experience globally and translation of research findings into clinical strategies that can improve
the lifespan and healthspan of PLWH now and for years to come."

This application aims to establish a Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center at the University of Michigan for the
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Our Center is anchored at the Michigan Center for
Translational Pathology and brings together a multi-disciplinary team of leading scientific experts in the
foundational areas of proteomics, cancer genomics, immunomics, and integrative systems biology. Our team
established the foundations for precision oncology and proteogenomics at the University of Michigan and has
a long history of successful inter-institutional collaborations. This positions us well to apply, working in close
collaboration with other CPTAC groups, our innovative algorithms, comprehensive computational

ascertainment of their biological implications. Both of these features are of paramount importance to
understand disease mechanisms and discover prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. Our proposed
strategy combines well-established and innovative data analyses and modeling approaches, cognizant of
continuing developments in the corresponding areas. In addition, we propose a conceptually novel approach
of “integrative cellular network analysis” and advanced data visualization modules, capitalizing on recent
advances in single cell and spatial proteogenomics research. These features will refine inference from the
bulk tissue omics data in terms of tumor microenvironment, ploidy and cellularity, identification of cell of origin
and clonal expansion, cell-cell interactions, distinguishing lineage versus cancer-specific biomarkers, and
gene signatures associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. Such precise and refined integrative
analyses across genome and proteome data require advanced bioinformatics tools and stringent quality
control measures. Our integrated genome/transcriptome/proteome pipelines – already in wide use by the
research community - will be further optimized for speed and accuracy and enhanced with data visualization
and report generation capabilities for presenting the findings to cancer biologists in a transparent and readily-
interpreted manner. Furthermore, our extensive experience in the area of biomarker discovery and precision
oncology, further enhanced through participation of our investigators in the EDRN, SPORE, and other NIH

specific proteins and peptides for subsequent targeted validation assays."

This application aims to establish a Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center at the University of Michigan for the
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Our Center is anchored at the Michigan Center for
Translational Pathology and brings together a multi-disciplinary team of leading scientific experts in the
foundational areas of proteomics, cancer genomics, immunomics, and integrative systems biology. Our team
established the foundations for precision oncology and proteogenomics at the University of Michigan and has
a long history of successful inter-institutional collaborations. This positions us well to apply, working in close

Numerous studies in human populations, human tissue, animal models and cell culture demonstrate that
environmental genotoxic and oxidative stress are associated with accelerated telomere shortening and
dysfunction. Telomeres at chromosome ends are essential for genome stability and sustained cell
proliferation, and dysfunctional telomeres contribute to degenerative diseases and carcinogenesis in humans.
The goals of this project are to advance exciting discoveries and highly innovative work from two NIEHS
funded R01 awards investigating the consequences of nucleobase damage and excision repair at telomeres.
The overarching hypothesis for this R35 proposal is that telomere shortening and dysfunction caused by
environmental genotoxic and oxidative stress, occurs via formation of specific base lesions and toxic repair
intermediates that directly interfere with telomere replication and maintenance. Working with collaborators we
pioneered a highly innovative chemoptogenetic tool that selectively induces DNA lesions at telomeres. This
technology is transformative because targeting well-defined base damage to telomeres allows us to
unequivocally attribute phenotypic changes and health outcomes to the induced telomere lesions, eliminating
confounding effects of damage elsewhere. We fully validated this system for the targeted formation of a
common oxidative guanine lesion at telomeres, and remarkably, we discovered that the chronic generation this
lesion induces profound hallmarks of telomere dysfunction that mimic genetic loss of telomere shelterin
proteins. This project will probe and uncover the mechanisms of DNA lesion induced telomere loss and
dysfunction. A major strategy is to extend and modify this flexible technology in a phased approach for
introducing base damage, toxic repair intermediates, bulky monoadducts, and other lesion types. We will
measure various cellular and telomeric endpoints after lesion induction and will use candidate and unbiased
approaches to identify proteins required to protect telomeres against the various forms of environmentally
relevant DNA damage. This chemoptogenetic tool has been adapted for use in model organisms, and as the
R35 evolves we will translate what we learn in cell culture to experiments in transgenic zebrafish and mice.
Using this system, we will generate telomeric damage in key organs and cell types and will measure the impact
on organ function and health. This program will lead to significant advances in mechanistic understanding of
how environmentally relevant forms of telomeric DNA lesions impact telomere function, cellular function, and
organism health. Ultimately, knowledge gained from this program will be highly valuable for developing new
strategies that 1) preserve telomeres to ameliorate the effects of genotoxic and oxidative stress in healthy cells
or conversely, that 2) inhibit telomere maintenance in malignant cells to arrest proliferation."

10832485,"During alveolarization, the final stage of lung development, angiogenesis drives the exponential, postnatal
increase in gas-exchange surface area. Pericytes play a dual role in angiogenesis. Initially, pericytes stimulate
and guide endothelial cells (EC) during early microvascular growth and subsequently constrain EC proliferation
and migration during vessel stabilization. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate pericyte phenotype
to drive these distinct roles in vascular growth and stability remain poorly defined. Addressing this gap may
motivate the development of therapies to treat neonatal lung diseases marked by compromised angiogenesis,
including bronchopulmonary dysplasia. O2-sensitive transcription factors, termed hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)
are central regulators of angiogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that HIF activity in select subsets of lung
mesenchymal cells (MC) is required for postnatal angiogenesis and alveolarization. Genetic gain- and loss-of-
function studies using Tagln promoter driven Cre-recombinase (a gene expressed by multiple MC including
pericytes), demonstrated that Tagln-specific HIF stabilization preserved pulmonary vascular and alveolar
growth in hyperoxia. Conversely, Tagln-specific Hif-1a deletion impaired pulmonary angiogenesis and
alveolarization even in normoxia. However, the specific Tagln-expressing MC responsible was not identified. Our
single cell transcriptomic studies point to a unique, hyperoxia-sensitive, developmental role for pericytes and
HIF signaling in pericytes during postnatal lung development. These studies identified: (i) marked changes
in the transcriptome of early (P7) versus late (P21) pericytes with blood vessel morphogenesis as the most
enriched biologic pathway; (ii) a peak in both proliferating pericytes and microvascular EC at P7; (iii) persistent
Hif-1a, -2a, and HIF downstream target expression in pericytes, including Rgs5, a gene that marks activated,
angiogenic pericytes, and Lgals1, a gene encoding a secreted, pro-angiogenic, carbohydrate-binding protein;
and (iv) hyperoxia-induced loss of ~90% of pericytes, all proliferating pericytes, and suppressed HIF-dependent,
pericyte-EC interactions. These observations suggest the overall working hypothesis that HIF-mediated
alterations in pericyte phenotype during postnatal development modulate the pulmonary angiogenesis
that drives alveolarization. that will be tested in 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will use genetic mouse models, primary
pericyte cultures, and ChIP-Seq to define the developmental role of HIF in pericytes on lung vascular growth.
Aim 2 will use primary pericyte and EC co-cultures and loss of function strategies to determine if developmental
regulation of select HIF-regulated targets in lung pericytes modulate pericyte phenotype and EC angiogenic
function. Aim 3 will use HIF reporter mice, deep scRNA-Seq and genetic lineage tracing to determine if hyperoxia
suppresses pericyte HIF-signaling, and disrupts pericytes fate and ontogeny during late lung development. By
focusing on the lung pericyte, at single cell resolution, these studies will provide insight into pulmonary vascular
development and identify strategies to promote lung growth and regeneration."

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor 2 is a presynaptic receptor enriched in active zones of
glutamatergic nerve terminals within the striatum and is pivotal for brain functions and some
mental illnesses. Recently, we found that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)
directly binds to mGlu2 receptors and phosphorylates mGlu2 receptors at a threonine residue in
the intracellular C-terminal tail. These findings for the first time reveal the mGlu2 receptor as a
direct substrate of CaMKII. Encouraged by this novel discovery, we propose this renewal
application to systematically study this previously unrecognized CaMKII-mGlu2 coupling and to
explore roles of CaMKII and mGlu2 receptors in the pathogenesis and symptomatology of a
common mental illness. Our hypothesis is that CaMKII regulates mGlu2 receptors and links
mGlu2 plasticity to depression-like behavior. Using multidisciplinary approaches, this hypothesis
will be tested both in vitro and in vivo in the following four inter-supportive Aims. Aim I will
characterize fundamental protein biochemistry of the CaMKII-mGlu2 interplay in vitro. Aim II will
define the regulation of CaMKII-mGlu2 interactions and mGlu2 receptor phosphorylation by
changing Ca2+ signals in striatal glutamatergic nerve terminals in vivo. Aim III will explore
functional roles of CaMKII in modulating trafficking and subcellular expression of mGlu2 receptors
and in controlling the efficacy of various mGlu2 signaling events. Aim IV will first monitor long-
lasting neuroadaptations of the striatal CaMKII-mGlu2 system in response to prolonged social
isolation in adult rats, a chronic stress paradigm modeling anhedonic depression in adulthood
animals. Aim IV will then clarify functional roles of CaMKII-mGlu2 interactions in the isolation-
induced depression-like behavior. Results achieved here will conceptually advance our current
understanding of a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism in regulating glutamate receptor
signaling at presynaptic sites. They will also ultimately contribute to the development of novel
pharmacotherapies, by targeting CaMKII and mGlu2 receptors, for the treatment of core
symptoms of depression."
10832606,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is central to host immune responses and is important for protective responses to pathogens. We report here a non-canonical role for TRAF6. The tick- borne flaviviruses (TBFVs) have evolved a unique mechanism to use TRAF6 to benefit infection. Understanding how the balance between TRAF6’s antiviral and proviral effects is tipped in favor of TBFV replication may reveal how flaviviruses overcome the cellular antiviral environment, to ultimately cause disease. We identified an interaction between TRAF6 and the TBFV protease, NS3pro. TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is normally associated with antiviral functions in the context of virus infections. Surprisingly, TBFVs use TRAF6 to replicate in cells. Here, we show that TBFV NS3pro protein interaction with TRAF6 during infection supports TBFV replication. The proviral role of TRAF6 was not seen with mosquito-borne flaviviruses, consistent with the lack of a conserved TRAF6 binding motif. Disruption of the TRAF6-NS3pro interaction by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a significant reduction of mature protease protein expression, and attenuation of in vitro virus replication. To investigate the TRAF6 proviral function, we assessed the ubiquitination status and found that NS3pro is ubiquitinated in the presence of TRAF6. The overall objective of this application is to determine how NS3-TRAF6 interaction affects protease structure and function(s), virus replication, and pathogenesis in a mouse model of TBFV infection. We hypothesize that NS3pro is activated by TRAF6 through direct interaction and ubiquitination, ultimately to promote productive virus replication. To test our hypothesis, we will use two specific aims. 1) To determine how TRAF6 benefits TBFV replication we will use cell biology and biochemical approaches to determine how NS3pro is modified by ubiquitination and how ubiquitination affects the structure and function of NS3pro. 2) To determine the proviral role of TRAF6 in primary cells (e.g., dendritic cells and neurons) and in pathogenesis in vivo we will use therapeutic and genetic methods to manipulate TRAF6 expression in primary cells and in a mouse model of TBFV pathogenesis. By understanding how TRAF6 benefits NS3pro and its role during infection, we will gain insight into the regulation of a critically important viral enzyme. Then by using a mouse model of TBFV infection we will determine the extent to which the NS3-TRAF6 interaction may be targeted for flavivirus drug development."
10832610,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 6.5 million people in the United States currently live with progressive neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementias including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), yet no treatments to stop their
progression are available. The presence of aggregated proteins in the brain (tau, amyloid β (Aβ), and α-
synuclein) is thought to underlie disease, and clinical overlap in presentation of these diseases associates with
the presence of more than one type of pathology. The factors influencing cellular and network vulnerability to
each individual pathology or co-occurring pathologies are not well-understood. A proper understanding of
vulnerability in the context of co-pathologies is necessary for the development and evaluation of novel disease-
modifying treatments.
This project will test the hypothesis that progression of intracellular α-synuclein and tau pathologies are bound
by neuroanatomical connectivity but influenced by network and cell-level vulnerability. Network and cell-level
vulnerability may also be influenced by additional factors such as the presence of co-pathologies, including
extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques. To test this hypothesis, the following aims will be pursued: (i) progression
of α-synuclein and tau pathologies will be mapped in wildtype mice bearing single or multiple pathologies at high
resolution using registration to a common neuroanatomical atlas, and network parameters of progression will be
assessed with computational modeling (Specific Aim 1); quantitative pathology and network analysis will be
utilized to assess the impact of Aβ plaques on the development, spread, and network vulnerability to α-synuclein
and tau co-pathology in knock-in mice that express human tau and develop Aβ plaques and in a time-dependent
manner (Specific Aim 2); spatial transcriptomics of human AD brain, DLB brain, and mouse co-pathology brain
will be used to determine unique molecular signatures of neurons vulnerable to α-synuclein or tau pathologies.
Vulnerability signatures will be validated with combined in situ hybridization-immunofluorescence and integrated
with network vulnerability and regional gene expression to develop and evaluate a model of human co-pathology
progression as a resource for understanding disease progression and evaluating therapeutic efficacy (Specific
Aim 3).
The proposed research is expected to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal progression of co-
pathologies and to develop improved tools to evaluate efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies that could slow
the progression of neurodegenerative diseases."
10834109,"Although benzodiazepines (BZs) are considered to be among the safest prescription drugs in modern medicine,
their utility is constrained by a number of side effects, including the liability for abuse, and recent epidemiological
research suggests BZ abuse is on the rise in the U.S. The overall goal of this application is to investigate the
extent to which GABAA receptor subtypes are differentially involved in self-administration vs. anxiolytic-like
effects of BZ ligands, with the goal of developing medications to treat BZ addiction. This renewal application
builds on our work from past project periods that has implicated unique roles for α1, α2, and α3 subunit-containing
GABAA receptors (α1GABAA, α2GABAA, α3GABAA receptors, respectively) in the anxiolytic-like effects and
abuse potential of BZs. The key findings from our work include: (1) compounds lacking efficacy at α1GABAA
receptors and relatively low efficacy at α2GABAA/α3GABAA receptors may have reduced abuse potential
compared with conventional BZs, but retain robust anxiolytic-like effects; and (2) antagonists that target
α1GABAA, α2GABAA, and α3GABAA receptors, but not α5GABAA receptors, can block the reinforcing effects of
BZs. In addition, we have obtained enough data and novel ligands to propose the development of
pharmacotherapies for BZ addiction, i.e., medication-assisted treatment. Nevertheless, significant knowledge
gaps remain before lead compounds can be selected and optimized. Using relevant nonhuman primate models,
our proposed studies specifically will evaluate the hypotheses that (1) the anxiolytic-like effects of BZs are
mediated by α2GABAA receptor subtypes; (2) intrinsic efficacy at α1GABAA receptor subtypes is a key
determinant of the reinforcing effectiveness of BZ-type ligands; and (3) different levels of intrinsic efficacy at
GABAA receptor subtypes determine the extent to which subtype-selective ligands alter the reinforcing effects of
abused BZs. Anxiolytic activity will be evaluated in rhesus monkeys using conflict procedures in which food-
maintained behavior is concurrently suppressed by response-produced presentations of an aversive stimulus.
Abuse potential will be assessed using behavioral economics and progressive-ratio schedules, in conjunction
with quantitative pharmacological analysis. Our approach to identifying receptor mechanisms and therapeutic
strategies may have a profound and long-lasting impact on not just the scientific field, but also the treatment-
provider community and, most importantly, the patients struggling with BZ addiction."

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been very successful in identifying genetic variants
associated with complex diseases and traits, it is still challenging to translate GWAS results into clinically
useful disease risk models for improved disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and
treatment. Furthermore, most GWAS conducted to date have focused on individuals of European ancestry,
making it difficult to derive risk models in other populations. Recent research has suggested shared genetic
contributions to complex diseases across populations and the potential benefit of considering functional
annotations in cross-population analysis. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop rigorous, efficient,
and robust integrative modeling approaches for risk prediction across populations by capitalizing on the vast
amount of publicly available GWAS summary data, abundant functional annotations, and a growing number of
studies with participants from underrepresented populations. This will be accomplished through five specific
aims. The first three aims will develop three complementary approaches for cross-population risk predictions,
including: (Aim 1) a Bayesian approach (ME-Pred), along the line of our published work to incorporate either
functional annotation information or multiple trait information, that explicitly models joint effect sizes from
multiple populations and functional annotations; (Aim 2) an empirical Bayes approach (GWEB) that considers a
more general and flexible effect size distribution and statistical inference that does not need a validation cohort
for tuning some model parameters; and (Aim 3) a fast and robust Bayesian nonparametric method (SDPR) that
is highly adaptive to different genetic architectures and is computationally efficient. Extensive simulations will
be performed to compare the performance of these methods and other existing methods. In Aim 4, we will
apply these methods to evaluate the potential clinical utility for various diseases and traits, with a focus on
underrepresented populations. We will also work closely with investigators from the Yale Generations Project
to study the potential benefit of these tools for its study participants, including many from the underrepresented
populations. We will then refine the implementations of some methods to reduce computational time and
improve the user interface and analysis pipeline in Aim 5. We have assembled a team of investigators with
expertise in statistical genetics, medical genetics, and high-performance computing to develop, implement,
evaluate, and disseminate the proposed methods. If successful, these methods and tools will lead to more
accurate genetic risk predictions in underrepresented populations, addressing a critical need in reducing health

Since December 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended lung cancer screening
(LCS) with low-dose computed tomography for high-risk individuals with a smoking history, affording a major
opportunity to reduce lung cancer mortality, especially in racial/ethnic and disadvantaged populations that are
disproportionately affected by the disease. Yet, there is concern that LCS is not being delivered effectively and
equitably, given its many unique implementation challenges. LCS utilization remains low. Emerging data also
suggest poorer uptake of LCS in Black versus white individuals. Even less is known about racial/ethnic
disparities in smoking cessation, although smoking cessation counseling is an integral component of the LCS
process. Identifying factors associated with LCS utilization, particularly those that contribute to racial/ethnic
disparities, is thus critical to deliver LCS optimally. Following well-established conceptual frameworks in which
multiple levels of influence affect cancer screening behaviors, we posit that LCS utilization is affected by
individual-, neighborhood-, provider-, and health facility-level factors. Studies to identify multilevel factors
associated with LCS utilization have been limited to date, due in part to known constraints in the data sources
available to evaluate LCS, especially at steps before screening initiation. Electronic health records (EHR) are a
recognized but largely untapped data source to address LCS. Compared to other data sources, integrated
health system EHRs capture comprehensive longitudinal data on clinical services from a defined population,
providing a robust and efficient means to investigate multilevel determinants of disparities in LCS utilization. In
our foundational work using EHR data to characterize early patterns of LCS utilization, we found evidence of
racial/ethnic disparities in the process after screening initiation. In this proposal, we aim to identify and
understand multilevel determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in LCS utilization, before and up through
screening initiation. Specifically, we will determine the influence of factors at the individual, neighborhood,
provider, and facility levels on disparities in LCS utilization, starting from the opportunity to be screened, as
measured by the completeness of EHR documentation on smoking history to assess LCS eligibility (Aim 1),
followed by LCS referral and initiation (Aim 2) and referral and use of smoking cessation services (Aim 3). We
will compile, link, and analyze available EHR, questionnaire, and geospatial data from a sociodemographically
diverse population of over 1.3 million adults in an integrated health system from 2014 to 2023. Overall, our
multilevel analysis will generate valuable insight into the major and modifiable drivers of racial/ethnic disparities
at key steps in LCS from eligibility assessment to screening initiation. These findings will provide an empirical
basis to guide health systems in developing multilevel interventions that improve LCS outreach and utilization,
both effectively and equitably."
10834743,"Project Summary: Cancer is a leading global cause of mortality. The goal of this multi-disciplinary
project is to pre-clinically advance a novel concept for selective and efficient mRNA delivery that enables a
highly promising vaccination strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Given the potential of cancer vaccination
to both generate new antigen-specific T cell responses against tumor cells and amplify existing responses,
cancer vaccination could be an especially effective therapy on its own or in combination with, e.g., check-
point blockade. Through a unique collaboration of chemists, cancer immunologists and biostatisticians we
propose to advance just such a method called CART-RNA which in preliminary studies has produced
cures of up to 80% in animals with established tumors.
 The critical technological challenge for mRNA and all gene-based therapies is the development of
safe, effective, accessible and selective mRNA delivery vectors. This project exploits a unique class of
charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs) that complex, protect and selectively deliver mRNA to
target cells/organs and then release mRNA intracellularly through an unprecedented charge-altering
mechanism, mediating exceptionally effective translation to proteins both in cell culture and in live animals.
 The three interrelated specific aims are directed at the design and evaluation of novel CARTs that
deliver mRNA to a variety of cell types, elicit functional protein expression, and induce a therapeutic
immunological response. Aim 1 leverages the synthetic expertise of the team and the ease of formulation
of CART-RNA vectors to assess the relationship of CART chemical structure, formulation and
administration to the efficiency and selectivity of protein expression in culture and in live animals. Aim 2 is
directed at the evaluation of CART-RNA vaccination to elicit protective immunological responses in
validated mouse models for cancer immunotherapy. Aim 3 focuses on pre-clinical investigations to elicit
protective immunity against clinically-relevant antigens (specifically B- and T-cell lymphoma idiotypes) in
primary human cells from human patients.
 This project exploits an interdisciplinary approach that integrates materials design and synthesis,
chemistry, microbiology, non-invasive cellular and live animal imaging, immunology and biostatistics to
develop, evaluate and refine strategies for the development of novel vaccines based on the new CART-
RNA platform. Cellular and live animal imaging techniques will be employed to assess the efficiency of
both mRNA delivery and expression as a function of mode of administration in mice. This research will
identify and clarify design criteria for engineering effective mRNA delivery systems and the effectiveness
of mRNA-based approaches for immunotherapy. This project is directed at new families of superior
transfecting agents for mRNA delivery and mRNA vaccination for treating and curing cancer."

Immunotherapy has shown remarkable benefit for some patients with solid cancers. However, it has largely been
ineffective for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Notably, cancers with liver metastasis
often show decreased responsiveness to immunotherapy and PDAC commonly metastasizes to the liver. Our
lab has previously shown that PDAC triggers liver inflammation during early disease pathogenesis that
subsequently supports metastasis to the liver. However, it remains unclear how the liver might influence
outcomes to immunotherapy. The liver is classically known as an immunoregulatory organ involved in regulating
T cell tolerance. Preliminary data show that serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins released by the liver in the setting
of PDAC development suppress T cell surveillance in mouse models of PDAC such that genetic deletion of SAA
converts PDAC tumors from T cell “poor” to T cell “rich”. SAA are known to signal through toll-like receptor 2
(TLR2) and consistent with this, preliminary data also show that genetic deletion of TLR2 causes T cell infiltration
into PDAC tumors even in the presence of high levels of SAA. This finding implicates the SAA/TLR2 signaling
pathway as a determinant of T cell surveillance in PDAC. However, little is known about how TLR2 regulates T
cells surveillance in cancer. It is the central hypothesis of this proposal that TLR2 signaling causes
sequestration of tumor-specific effector T cells in the liver which then undergo apoptosis, thereby
limiting productive T cell surveillance in PDAC. To test this hypothesis, in Aim One I will define cellular
mechanisms by which TLR2 regulates T cell surveillance in PDAC. In Aim Two, I will determine the impact of
TLR2 on tumor-specific T cell fate and the efficacy of T cell immunotherapy. Altogether, studies in this proposal
will improve our understanding of the role of tumor-extrinsic features in regulating immune resistance in PDAC
with the aim to identify novel strategies for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. This project will be
sponsored by an established mentor with expertise in cancer immunology and tumor biology. This sponsorship
entails a strong commitment to mentorship at an institution with an exceptional environment for training in cancer
immunology and tumor biology. The project also includes a rigorous graduate training plan to complement
training in scientific research with didactics and training in scientific communication and teaching."
10834749,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
By the time they are typically detected, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) are already challenging to treat. ADHD is characterized, in part, by deficits in self-regulation,
while social communication deficits are a hallmark of ASD. Although traditional diagnostic definitions imply
distinct phenotypes, co-occurrence is common with evidence of shared heritability, but little is known about
overlapping versus unique markers and mechanisms early in development. Putative shared processes include
dysregulation of attention and affect. Based on links with these processes, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA),
an index of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) functioning reflecting effort allocation and emotion
regulation, has been suggested as a potential transdiagnostic biomarker. No prior studies have examined shared
versus distinct contributions of atypical infant PNS functioning, attention regulation, and affect regulation to later
self-regulation and social communication deficits in infants at genetic risk for such challenges. Moreover, few
studies have characterized continuity of symptoms across early childhood in high-risk samples, nor have infant
predictors of symptom continuity been examined. Addressing these points is imperative to enhancing early
detection efforts, delineating mechanisms underlying symptom development, identifying targets and time points
for prevention and intervention, and determining novel markers of treatment efficacy. This proposal seeks to
better understand developmental pathways to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of cognitive
systems (cognitive control/self-regulation) and social processes (social communication) across early
development in a sample enriched for such challenges: infants at familial risk for ASD (n = 60), familial risk for
ADHD (n = 60), and low risk for both (n = 40). We aim to: (1) identify shared and distinct early behavioral and
physiological markers of, and mechanisms underlying, self-regulation and social communication problems
among infants at risk, and (2) evaluate continuity of self-regulation and social communication problems across
early childhood, including delineation of infant predictors of such continuity. Leveraging previous NIH support
(K99/R00 MH106642) and employing a multi-method, multi-informant, multi-dimensional design, infants will be
evaluated at 6 or 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age with a focus on trajectories and mediational mechanisms.
This R01 proposal responds to the NIMH Strategic Plan to “Define the Mechanisms of Complex Behaviors” and
“Chart Mental Illness Trajectories to Determine When, Where, and How to Intervene.” Exploring shared versus
distinct mechanisms underlying the development of self-regulation and social communication symptoms will
improve early identification of disorders like ADHD and ASD and encourage the development of transdiagnostic,
process-focused early interventions, consistent with RDoC goals."
10834752,"The five year survival rate for ovarian cancer (OC) patients has remained at 47% for over two decades.
OC is characterized by a highly suppressive tumor microenvironment and current research efforts focus on
reversing this immune suppression. One way to activate the immune response against OC is using epigenetic
therapeutics, which stimulate an interferon response in cancer cells by inducing the transcription of repetitive
elements (REs)—genomic regions that resemble the genetic material of some viruses. As REs are normally
silent in terminally differentiated cells, their upregulation in tumor cells suggests that these genomic elements
can be used as inducible treatment targets. T cells specific for an RE-derived antigen, the non-functional
envelope gene of endogenous retrovirus K (ERV-K-Env), can recognize their cognate antigen and kill OC cells
while sparing healthy cells. Whether these T cells will be more lytic when combined with immunogenic epigenetic
therapy is unknown. Aside from ERV-K-Env, other epigenetically upregulated REs serve as an unexplored pool
of tumor-associated antigens that may be novel treatment targets. I hypothesize that combining epigenetic
therapy with RE-specific T cells will have potent immunogenic and targeted anti-tumor efficacy in OC.
 In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of combination epigenetic therapy and ERK-K-Env-specific T cells in
OC. Preliminary data suggest this candidate RE, ERV-K-Env, is a targetable tumor-associated antigen in OC. I
hypothesize that combining epigenetic therapy with ex vivo expanded ERV-K-Env-specific T cells will
result in targeted immunogenic OC cell killing. ERV-K-Env-specific T cells will be expanded ex vivo from
whole blood donors and assessed in vitro for antigen specificity. I will co-culture the expanded T cells with
epigenetically treated OC cells and assess T cell activation and cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
 In Aim 2, I will identify and target additional tumor-associated RE peptides as novel OC tumor antigens.
Preliminary data from my lab suggest that epigenetic treatment results in the upregulation of REs and their
presentation on the surface of OC cells to the immune system. I hypothesize that diverse tumor-associated
REs upregulated by epigenetic therapy can be therapeutically relevant T cell targets in OC. Bioinformatic
tools will be used to identify which REs upregulated by epigenetic therapy have the potential to be T cell antigens.
I will validate the immunogenicity of these antigens by expanding RE-specific T cells from healthy donors and
assess the clinical relevance of the experimentally validated REs as treatment targets using OC patient T cells.
 Completion of the proposed project will provide new knowledge on the combination of epigenetic therapy
with RE-specific T cells as a novel immunogenic and potentially curative treatment strategy for OC. Collectively,
these innovative interdisciplinary experiments will shed light on the understudied role of REs as therapeutic
targets while further elucidating the mechanisms involved in activating an anti-tumor immune response that may
be applicable to other solid tumors."

the WRIISC & PNS are focusing on is Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The VISN 21 MIRECC has a long research
history addressing sleep disorders in Veterans including several research projects on insomnia in Veterans. In
recent years over 650 VA mental health clinicians have been trained in CBT-I by the VISN 21 MIRECC. The
proposed collaboration between WRIISC, PNS and MIRECC will evaluate the efficacy of Cognitive Behavior
Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in TBI Veterans with chronic insomnia in a randomized controlled trial. CBT-I
has been suggested to be a good alternative to pharmacological approaches in the treatment of TBI patients
with insomnia but evidence to support this claim is lacking.
This trial will compare CBT-I with a previously used manualized active control condition called “Credible
Control Therapy for Insomnia” (CCT-I) in mild TBI (mTBI) patients suffering from insomnia. Like many
previous control conditions in randomized controlled trials CCT-I includes a sleep hygiene component.
Our hypotheses will be tested in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The randomization will be stratified by
potential comorbidity of current Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and use of sleep medications. After
screening and randomization in the 2-week baseline phase, subjects will receive either CBT-I or CCT-I in the
6-week treatment phase. This 4-year proposal will include 120 mTBI patients (2 groups of n=60 each) with
relevant measures collected at baseline, week 8 after treatment and week 32 for follow-up. The primary
outcome will be the Insomnia Severity Index. The secondary outcome will be the SF 36-Item Health Survey."

Delivering diagnostic services at the point-of-care (POC) can improve the quality of healthcare in clinics, in
emergency settings, or at home, which can potentially ease hospitals’ burden, for instance, during the COVID-
19 pandemic. Precision and personalized medicine revolution also require POC testing to provide readily
available biomarker information to clinicians. The goal of this career development proposal is to create fast,
inexpensive, sensitive, and reliable molecular diagnostics to address the 21st-century healthcare challenges.
The central hypothesis is that we can efficiently utilize computational protein design to create modular
allosteric protein switches, named LOCKR (Latching Orthogonal Cage–Key pRotein), that enable the rapid
and reversible conformational changes upon interaction. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that LOCKR-
based biosensors can be configured to produce bioluminescence upon the addition of clinical targets (e.g.,
botulinum toxin, cardiac troponin I, HER2 receptor, Fc domain, anti-HBV mAb, anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies,
and SARS-CoV2 receptor-binding domain/spike protein, Fig 1 and 2) in homogeneous “all-in-solution”
assays. Due to the modularity of LOCKR sensor platform and the advance in de novo binder design for
arbitrary protein targets, we proposed the integration of both features as the universal strategy to develop
tailored biosensors for user-defined targets. The main specific aims for the independent phase are to
iteratively expand LOCKR-based diagnostics with the synergy of (1) de novo protein binder design to directly
detect various disease protein biomarkers, and (2) indirectly detect the antibodies that compete with the
designed interface, as POC devices; and (3) to repurpose the original luminescence signal with other
compatible readouts by exchanging the reporter modules. For more specific proof-of-concept projects during
the mentored phase, I describe in Aim 1 the use of state-of-the-art computational protein design methods to
create an interleukin-6 binder and biosensor. In Aim 2, I propose a general way to develop antibody
biosensors by demonstrating COVID-19 serological tests as an example. With my expertise in biosensor
engineering, I attempt in Aim 3 to develop a ratiometric bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
biosensor to analyze the HBV antibody and a colorimetric biosensor to measure human cardiac troponin I
level. Ultimately, I anticipate this new sensor platform is significant for the development of robust protein
sensors that will be broadly applicable to arbitrary targets and enabling its POC compatible readouts for future
diagnostics."
10846854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Healthy functioning necessitates an ability to manage our emotions. A growing body of evidence suggests that
sleep plays a crucial role in this adaptive process by maintaining the neural circuitry required to optimize emotion
regulation. Further, chronically disrupted sleep is a common feature and potentially an underlying cause of a
number of psychiatric disorders marked by impaired mood and emotion regulation, such as depression. The
consequences of this relationship become even more dire with the recognition that chronic sleep disruption more
than doubles the risk of suicide. The objective of the proposed study is to determine the overlapping and
differential impact of clinical insomnia in patients and multiple nights of insufficient sleep in healthy controls on
behavioral and neural responses during an emotion regulation task. My central hypothesis is that clinical sleep
disturbance and multiple nights of truncated sleep both disrupt the circuitry needed for successful emotion
regulation, and therefore are critical drivers in the dysregulation of emotional functioning. The primary rationale
is that a vast majority of our understanding of the relationship between disrupted sleep and emotion function has
relied either on single-night, acute sleep deprivation or assessment of trends in large samples, leaving a major
gap in understanding the mechanistic impact of longer, more chronic sleep loss on emotion regulation. This
information is essential to understand the degree to which different forms of disrupted sleep account for mood
and emotion dysregulation in a host of psychiatric conditions. In the proposed study, I will recruit patients with
Insomnia Disorder (ID; n=25) and healthy individuals that undergo a normal sleep (n=25) or sleep restriction
(n=25) protocol. All participants will complete an emotion regulation paradigm on two occasions, once as a
baseline, and a second time during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I predict that when employing
emotion regulation strategies to aversive stimuli, sleep restricted participants and ID patients will have largely
overlapping behavioral and neural network outcomes, including impaired ability to volitionally reduce negative
behavioral responses, amygdala hyperactivity, and weaker negative connectivity between the amygdala and
prefrontal cortex. The study is a necessary next step in determining the behavioral and neural consequences of
chronic sleep disruption on the ability to effectively regulate emotions, which can then be used as targets for the
development of new therapies. My training plan adeptly complements both the technical and theoretical aspects
needed to successfully navigate the proposed project and my trajectory of future research. The selected activities
will provide the opportunity to develop expertise in the design of longitudinal sleep studies, fMRI data processing
and analysis, theoretical understanding of Insomnia Disorder and its relationship to psychiatric presentations,
and how to design and implement large-scale RCTs. Through this award, I will receive the necessary data and
training to establish myself as an independent investigator and prepare for future R01 submissions investigating
the variance in emotional dysregulation due to sleep disruption relevant to a host of psychiatric conditions."
10845955,"ABSTRACT
GPR37L1 is a recently deorphanized receptor belonging to the larger family of seven transmembrane receptors
that couple through G-proteins to regulate numerous biological functions. Using an unbiased computational
approach to probe its clinical significance, we identified a statistically significant association between human
genetic variants in GPR37L1 and a clinical diagnosis of migraine in a large, unselected patient population. Our
subsequent characterization of GPR37L1 receptors carrying human coding variants revealed robust signaling
differences and further study of gene targeted mice lacking the receptor demonstrated some interesting
behavioral features such as altered sex-dependent anxiety-like behavior, which is often associated with chronic
migraine-like states. Altogether, the results from these complementary approaches and the restricted GPR37L1
expression in astrocytes, whose dysfunction promotes migraine-like pain, strongly support the hypothesis that
GPR37L1 signaling plays a protective role in migraine.
Here, we propose to dissect the novel role of GPR37L1 signaling in the neuropathology of this disorder through
a concerted effort combining a wide range of complementary approaches to: 1) Assess GPR37L1 expression
and localization in mice exposed to a chronic migraine-like state; 2) Address the impact of genetic GPR37L1
deletion on astrocyte modulation of neuronal activity; and 3) Examine the effects of genetic GPR37L1 deletion
on a chronic migraine model that involves progressively increased measures of cephalic allodynia, photophobia
and anxiety-like behavior associated with repeated systemic administration of exogenous CGRP in female and
male mice. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled an investigative team with the interdisciplinary
expertise to conduct the broad range of genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches
that are necessary for a full understanding of the contributions of GPR37L1 to chronic migraine.
Altogether, we expect the results will show that altering the GPR37L1 signaling pathway produces astrocyte
dysfunction that critically affects neuronal function(s), resulting in increased sensitivity to head pain triggers and
other responses consistent with migraine. If validated, the demonstration that GPR37L1 activation is protective
with respect to migraine may have broad implications for other neurological disorders."

In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were
brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old.
Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example,
tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly
misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies,
debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high-
grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for
other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS
lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and
reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors
prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline
risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven
by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the
same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have
shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We
have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma.
We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to
diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus
personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based
machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and
solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic
glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary
brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning
model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective
cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is
actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative."

Child maltreatment is a significant and costly social issue with over 670,000 documented cases annually. The
effects of maltreatment are wide-ranging and include increased rates of morbidity and mortality from chronic
diseases. To improve the health and mortality of this vulnerable population it is critical to delineate the
pathways through which maltreatment contributes to increased risk for disease and identify opportunities for
prevention. Dysregulation of the body’s physiological stress response systems constitutes a key pathway
through which early maltreatment shapes biological aging processes and risk for subsequent disease. In
addition, recalibration of the stress system during adolescence may mitigate the effects of early trauma on
disease risk. Although the HPA axis in particular has been implicated as a key mechanism linking maltreatment
with disease, these associations have only been tested between any two of these variables (i.e., maltreatment
and HPA axis function, maltreatment and disease, or HPA axis function and disease) using cross-sectional or
retrospective reports of maltreatment. This study will be the first to test this hypothesized mediation model from
maltreatment to disease risk via HPA functioning using a developmental framework from childhood to young
adulthood, incorporating multiple indices of disease risk. Second, the proposed work will be the first to use
innovative new modeling techniques to characterize HPA axis functioning across four timepoints in
adolescence to pinpoint the particular aspects of the stress response and developmental periods of stress
system sensitivity that may lead to disease risk. Finally, this study will move beyond current conceptualizations
of stress system dysfunction by identifying resilient profiles of HPA axis functioning and moderators of HPA
axis recalibration that will provide critical new insights for intervention efforts focused on mitigating the effects
of maltreatment on disease risk. The importance of assessing disease risk in young adulthood is bolstered by
data indicating this period of life as a potential inflection point for long-term disease risk. As such, young
adulthood may be a critical window for prevention and an optimal time to assess modifiable health risks. To
accomplish this, we will leverage a unique prospective longitudinal dataset including youth with documented
maltreatment histories and a comparison group from the same communities (90% minority race/ethnicity). This
exemplary dataset will be augmented with follow-up assessment in young adulthood to capture disease risk.
The findings will provide the first longitudinal evidence of HPA axis as a critical mechanism through which
childhood maltreatment contributes to a lifelong trajectory of disease and whether recalibration of the HPA axis
in adolescence can mitigate the effects of early trauma on disease risk in young adulthood. Identification of
specific moderators of HPA axis recalibration can directly inform intervention and prevent stress-induced
disease."
10848424,"Hemodialysis treatment non-adherence is a public health issue because of its association with excessive
hospitalizations, high morbidity, and mortality, and increased financial costs. Compared to whites, African
Americans have a four-fold higher prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), higher non-adherence
rates to hemodialysis, and higher odds of hospitalizations. Motivational interviewing, an evidence-based
intervention that creates a bond between patients and providers, targets improvement in motivation-related
psychosocial factors associated with adherence behaviors. Interventions for such factors are typically
developed based on the dominant culture and may not be valid and generalizable to minority groups. Culturally
tailored interventions lead to more durable change in African Americans yet there is a lack of studies testing
the efficacy of such approaches to improve hemodialysis treatment adherence in African Americans. Use of
culturally tailored motivational interviewing in African Americans with ESKD will promote health equity by
improving dialysis treatment adherence, reducing hospitalizations, and enhancing other critical outcomes.
 Our long-term goal is to establish culturally sensitive strategies and multi-level interventions to improve
outcomes in kidney disease. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a culturally
tailored motivational interviewing intervention developed using a rigorous theoretical framework on improving
hemodialysis treatment adherence in African Americans with ESKD. The central hypothesis is that culturally
tailored motivational interviewing will lead to improved hemodialysis treatment adherence. We will test this
hypothesis in the following Specific Aims in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in African American patients with
ESKD. Compared to usual dialysis care, we aim to: Evaluate the efficacy of 8 weeks of culturally tailored
motivational interviewing (MOVE) on improving hemodialysis treatment adherence at (1) 3 months, and (2) 6
months post-randomization. At the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes
will include evidence of the efficacy of culturally tailored motivational interviewing on improving hemodialysis
treatment adherence in African American patients with ESKD. The proposed research is innovative because of
the novel application of a culturally tailored, evidence-based behavioral intervention developed using a rigorous
theoretical framework (PEN-3); the use of specifically-trained health coaches to optimize intervention delivery;
and the focus on understudied and overrepresented African American patients with ESKD to address the
public health issue of hemodialysis treatment non-adherence. Study results will provide a strong basis for
conducting an effectiveness and implementation trial, which is expected to have a significant impact on
hemodialysis adherence, hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality. This research strongly aligns with NIDDK's
mission to promote health equity by addressing health disparities in kidney disease."

We propose to create a multidisciplinary Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical Proteomics with the overarching goal
of identifying and validating proteomic biomarkers for treatment response in multiple myeloma. This center is a
unique alliance comprising of two teams within the Mayo Clinic umbrella and one team at Brigham Young
University. This team of physicians and scientists at Mayo Clinic with expertise in multiple myeloma
diagnosis, treatment, clinical trials and basic research as well as technologies such as mass
spectrometry, genomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics and clinical assay development will be joined
by a world expert in novel instrument/platform development at Brigham Young University to create a
unique center. Multiple myeloma is a complex disease with several distinct cytogenetic subtypes. A recently
developed class of drugs designated immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) has become a mainstay of
treatment of multiple myeloma although relapses among patients is high mainly due to drug resistance. The
primary target of IMiDs is cereblon (CRBN), which is absolutely required for its anti-cancer and immune activity.
IMiDs activate the enzymatic activity of the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex leading to ubiquitylation and
degradation of transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3, thereby regulating tumor survival and immune response
through downregulation of IRF4 and MYC. For the preclinical arm, our interdisciplinary team will undertake
discovery studies involving comprehensive proteogenomic characterization (proteome, phosphoproteome,
ubiquitylome, genome, transcriptome) of multiple myeloma models (genetically engineered cell lines, humanized
mouse models and patient samples) to identify molecular markers of IMiD resistance. Given the centrality of
CRBN-mediated pathways in IMiD resistance, we will jumpstart our targeted proteomics efforts by
focusing on developing targeted assays for CRBN and its downstream effectors. In parallel, we anticipate
identifying additional candidate proteins through our discovery studies, for which targeted assays will also be
developed. Finally, Dr. Vincent Rajkumar, a co-investigator on this proposal, will provide access to samples from
three NCI-sponsored clinical trials specifically designed to look at effects of IMiDs enabling validation of
candidates through a targeted approach. By incorporating continuous development of multiple technology
platforms including CyTOF, we will ensure that we maintain agility over the duration of the proposal.
With an established advanced infrastructure, personnel experienced in the development of CAP/CLIA assays,
dedicated instrumentation, high analytical capacity and existing pipelines for QC, data handling and
bioinformatics, the proposed Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical Proteomics is poised for success to discover and
validate proteomic markers of IMiD resistance in multiple myeloma."

Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a higher risk for acquisition, persistence, and progression of cervical
human papillomavirus (HPV) to precancerous lesions, which, in the absence of effective screening and
treatment services, can progress to invasive cancer at five-to-six times higher rates than in women without
HIV. The massive global mobilization of humanitarian resources spanning over the past couple of decades,
through initiatives such as the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has resulted in
millions of WLWH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now accessing affordable antiretroviral therapy
and consequently living longer lives. Yet, their risk for cervical cancer continues unabated since effective
screening and pre-cancer treatment services remain unavailable in most LMICs.
The HIV/Cervical Cancer Prevention “CASCADE” Clinical Trials Network plans to conduct pragmatic clinical
trials evaluating the effectiveness of clinically proven interventions to optimize the cervical cancer screening,
management, and pre-cancer treatment cascade for WLWH. These clinical trials will be conducted in intended-
use environments in resource-constrained settings in LMICs and in regions with health disparities in the United
States. The CASCADE Network will have four major scientific focus areas: increasing screening uptake,
improving management of screen positives, facilitating pre-cancer treatment access, and optimizing pre-cancer
treatment for cervical cancer prevention in WLWH. The CASCADE Network clinical trials will focus on the
measurement of the clinical effectiveness of interventions in intended use settings while gathering crucial
information informing the implementation and scale-up of such interventions across the cascade of screening
and pre-cancer treatment for WLWH. Such hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs will primarily focus on
clinical effectiveness endpoints such as HPV positivity rates and/or pre-cancer detection/incidence/recurrence
rates and will secondarily gather data on implementation-informing aspects such as costs, acceptability, and
intervention fidelity while studying implementation strategy.
To support the CASCADE Clinical Trials Network in partnership with the NCI's Division of Cancer Prevention,
CASCADE Research Bases and CASCADE Clinical Sites, the CASCADE Network Coordinating Center will (i)
provide overall network coordination and facilitate scientific review of network clinical trial concepts and
protocols, (ii) provide centralized support for data management for network clinical trials, and (iii) conduct
independent risk-appropriate auditing of network clinical trials. The CASCADE Network Coordinating Center
will serve as the organizational and coordination hub for the CASCADE Network and provide multi-disciplinary
expertise in program and operations management, clinical research informatics/information technology, and
clinical trials auditing."
10830479,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Disparities in the health care system are substantial, leading to worse health outcomes
and quality of care for marginalized groups. These disparities reflect that our current health system has an
inequitable equilibrium. Imbedded within health care data are societal biases, including racism and barriers in
access to care for individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds and rural areas. However, many
algorithmic approaches are inadequate for addressing health disparities because the algorithms do not
evaluate or optimize performance in these groups. Existing tools to ameliorate differential performance for
multiple marginalized groups in realistic health care settings are extremely limited. Our innovative approach to
the data and algorithmic bias problems in health disparities is to create a first-of-its-kind overarching
algorithmic fairness framework for multiple marginalized groups. In the initial phase, we will focus on data
transformations—intervening on the data in order to ‘de-bias’ it to represent a desired equilibrium rather than
reinforcing the unfair equilibrium. The second stage builds novel fair regression estimators to enforce fairness
constraints for prediction. Our goal is to create reusable tools that advance the equitable provision of health
care. We will accomplish this by developing generalizable methodology that follows an ethical pipeline for
algorithms guided by a social determinants of health framework. Our specific aims are to: (1) develop and test
novel data transformation methods that rely on microsimulations for de-biasing health care data, (2) develop
and test new fair penalized regression approaches optimized for multiple groups, (3) test the performance of
the new algorithmic framework for a high-impact primary care application in chronic kidney disease prioritizing
fairness for multiple racial and ethnic groups facing health disparities, and (4) create open-source
computational tools, tutorial vignettes, and a synthetic data resource for reproducible research and
dissemination. The proposed research will yield a statistically innovative reusable algorithmic fairness
framework unifying data transformations and fair regression to reduce health disparities with robust testing in a
chronic kidney disease study of quality of care. This primary care application will leverage rich registry data,
including measurements of social determinants of health, collected in usual care settings from a
geographically, racially, and ethnically diverse population across multiple payers. Our approach centers
robustness with rigorous methodological design, including comparisons to alternative existing estimators and
standard practice in comprehensive simulation studies and national, real-world registry data. Addressing health
disparities in primary care—a hub of continuous, coordinated care—has the potential for substantial impact on
improving public health via the health care system. The broad applicability of our framework and creation of
reusable computational tools will facilitate deployment in many practical settings."

Maternal health in the US is in crisis, where low-income pregnant and postpartum people (PPP) and PPP of
color experience suboptimal quality of care across the prenatal, delivery, and postpartum periods. As the
largest payer of maternity care, covering 66% of Black births and 60% of Hispanic births, the Medicaid program
plays a critical role in shaping maternal health for lower-income PPP of color, with significant opportunity for
care delivery models such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to improve PPP’s outcomes and equity
at scale through improved care integration, coordination, and quality improvement incentives. Despite growing
state interest in Medicaid ACOs, empirical evidence on the effects of Medicaid ACOs and ACO model types on
PPP is very limited. Yet, identifying optimal ACO model designs is critical for the 35 states that have not yet
implemented Medicaid ACOs and for other states looking to reform their ACOs. This R01 will fill these gaps by
evaluating the innovative, statewide Massachusetts (MA) Medicaid ACO, which aims to integrate medical,
behavioral, and social services and improve care quality and coordination across 16 ACOs under two distinct
ACO model types: (1) a primary care physician (PCP)-led ACO, where specialists (e.g., OB/GYNs) are not part
of the ACO and (2) a health system and Medicaid managed care plan partnership ACO, where PCPs and
specialists are part of the ACO. As patients do not select into a Medicaid ACO or model type, this creates a
novel nested natural experiment, which we will leverage in combination with qualitative methods, to examine
how Medicaid ACO programs affect health care quality and equity for PPP. Specific aims are to (1) evaluate
the effect of MA’s Medicaid ACO program on quality of care-sensitive measures for PPP, including prenatal
measures, delivery-related measures, and postpartum measures, using a difference-in-differences approach
with claims data, where sub-analyses will examine differential effects by racial/ethnic zip code group, (2)
evaluate the effect of PCP-led vs. health system partnership Medicaid ACO models on PPP, using the same
outcomes and analytic approach as in Aim 1, and (3) assess how efforts to address maternal health outcomes
are being operationalized and prioritized within MA Medicaid ACOs, and how this varies by model type, by
conducting semi-structured interviews with clinicians, care coordinators, and leadership; interviews will further
capture successes and challenges of these efforts, different organizational programs used to improve maternal
health care and equity for the ACO, and how inclusion or exclusion of OB/GYNs and specialists from the ACO
affects care management and coordination for PPP. As more states and Medicaid providers implement ACOs,
little evidence is available to guide them. Understanding how Medicaid ACOs can improve quality of care for
one of their most vulnerable populations—PPP—through value-based care is imperative both to value-based
model success and to improving health and equity at scale in this moment of maternal health crisis."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Forced expression of transcription factors (TFs) can reprogram cell state. The discovery of direct reprogramming
has been a catalyst for our understanding of the molecular and genetic drivers of cell state. However, despite its
successes, only a handful of successful reprogramming cocktails have been identified, the conversion process
is often inefficient, and the mechanistic reasons for reprogramming failure are often unclear. Thus, a key obstacle
to further progress is our incomplete understanding of the determinants and mechanisms of cell state conversion.
Our long term goal is to understand the genetic and molecular basis of cell state, which has important implications
for synthetic control of cell state for regenerative medicine. Towards this goal, the objective of this proposal is to
elucidate the molecular and cellular determinants of cell state reprogramming. Specifically, we seek to address
several fundamental gaps in knowledge on cell state reprogramming with three central research directions: 1)
Epigenetic determinants of cellular reprogramming, 2) Genetic and temporal determinants of cellular
differentiation, and 3) Initial cell state determinants on reprogramming. This scope is made possible by our
innovative platform that couples multifactorial, pooled perturbation with multidimensional readouts for each cell
spanning perturbations (induced TFs), mechanisms (epigenome), and phenotypes (transcriptome). By tracing
thousands of individual cells on their path to reprogramming across a multitude of distinct perturbations, our high
throughput functional experiments will reveal insights and suggest mechanisms for the determinants of
reprogramming. Our rationale is that learning these fundamental rules of reprogramming will improve our
understanding of the molecular basis of cell state and enable improved approaches to manipulate it."

A significant gap in understanding is how suboptimal control of hyperglycemia from type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
and prediabetes, particularly in young adults (18-45), influences later-life cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and related dementias (ADRD) risk. This gap is a critical barrier to developing T2DM prevention and
management interventions for reducing vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).
Hyperglycemia increasingly develops in younger adults and may impair their cognition.
 The central hypothesis is that higher cumulative hyperglycemia levels over the life course and subopti-
mal T2DM management contribute to faster cognitive decline and higher ADRD risk. Guided by robust prelimi-
nary data, the team will test this hypothesis using 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will quantify the influence of cumula-
tive hyperglycemia from young adulthood to late life on cognitive trajectories and ADRD in adults with and with-
out T2DM, and explore how sex, race, and hyperglycemia duration affect these relationships. Aim 2 will deter-
mine the impact of T2DM management (cumulative hemoglobin A1c levels) on cognitive trajectories in adults
with T2DM, and explore how sex, race, and T2DM duration affect these relationships. Aim 3 will identify poten-
tial mechanisms for T2DM-related ADRD. It will clarify the relationships between cumulative hyperglycemia
and magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease in adults with and without T2DM,
determine how much cerebral small vessel disease burden explains associations between cumulative hyper-
glycemia levels and cognitive decline and incident ADRD, and explore the role of stroke. Aims 1 and 3 will use
pooled cohort studies to measure the effects of glycemia and other vascular risk factors, cerebral small vessel
disease, and stroke on ADRD risk. Aim 2 will use an individual participant data meta-analysis of 3 trials to
quantify the effects of T2DM management and control of other vascular risk factors on cognitive trajectories.
 The multi-disciplinary research team has the proper expertise and a strong record of executing multi-
center pooled cohort studies of VCID. The study is innovative because it includes young adults and those with
prediabetes, and it will create new pooled datasets with unprecedented size and diversity in age, sex, geogra-
phy, race, ethnicity, and hyperglycemia duration for VCID research. Aims 1 and 2 will provide crucial evidence
on optimal control of glycemia and other vascular risk factors to reduce ADRD risk in people with T2DM and
prediabetes, especially in younger adults. Aim 3 will identify potential mechanisms for VCID interventions. The
study is significant because it will generate empirical evidence to guide future trials, shared decision-making in
clinical practice, clinical guidelines, and health policies to preserve cognitive health and prevent VCID in adults
with hyperglycemia. Over the long term, this knowledge will lead to new and innovative strategies for prevent-
ing VCID in diverse populations of adults with hyperglycemia, which is our goal."

The oxidation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds is a central biochemical process required by all aerobic
organisms. The microbial conversion of these bonds endows potent bioactivity on natural products and enable
pathogens to thrive on otherwise inert host-derived biomolecules. These reactions are currently known to be
accomplished by a short list of cofactors that include heme, nonheme iron, and copper. While manganese
cofactors perform difficult oxidation reactions, including water oxidation within Photosystem II, they are generally
not known to be used for C-H bond activation. We recently discovered that the 2-aminoisobutyric acid
hydroxylase from Rhodococcus wratislaviensis, AibH1H2, requires manganese to functionalize a strong,
aliphatic C-H bond (BDE = 100 kcal/mol). Structural and spectroscopic studies of this enzyme revealed a redox-
active, heterobimetallic manganese-iron active site at the locus of O2 activation and substrate coordination. This
result expands the known reactivity of biological manganese-iron cofactors, which was previously restricted to
single electron transfer or stoichiometric protein oxidation. Since the AibH1H2 cofactor is supported by a protein
fold distinct from typical, well-studied bimetallic oxygenases, our proposed research centers on the
characterization of ill-defined members of this protein family. Our preliminary results indicate that many of these
proteins harbor two active-site metal ions, behave as monooxygenases and, in some cases, display enhanced
enzymatic activity when manganese ions are preferentially incorporated within the active site. The core scientific
hypothesis for this study is that the unique sequence and structural features of this emergent class of
monooxygenases endows embedded manganese ions with otherwise unknown biological reactivity. To
investigate this hypothesis, the specific aims of this study are to (1) understand the signature amino acid motifs
that differentiate these monooxygenases from their ancestral, structurally-related amidohydrolases, (2)
characterize the geometric and electronic structures of mixed iron/manganese-containing enzymatic
intermediates, and (3) evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic competence of cambialistic Mn/Fe
monooxygenases. The resulting enzymatic information, methods, and structures will be of specific interest to
those in the fields of metallo-enzymology, structural biology, and synthetic bioinorganic chemistry, and of broad
interest to microbiologists in general."
10858162,"Project Summary
Neonates can now survive premature birth from as early as 22 weeks’ gestation, but often suffer from bron-
chopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) – chronic lung disease of prematurity. BPD consists of several phenotypes –
hyperdense lung consisting of fibrotic tissue or inflammation, hyperinflated airspaces, and airway collapse at
various levels from the upper airway to the distal airways. However, even if a patient’s phenotypes are identified,
there is no mechanism to calculate the relative contributions of the phenotypes to disease severity and symp-
toms. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to create and validate a tool to calculate the contribution of each
BPD phenotype. Such a tool would allow patient-specific treatment based on an individual’s disease phenotypes.
To address this clinical need, this proposal will create a tool to calculate the contribution of each phenotype of
BPD to elevated breathing effort. Breathing effort, known as the work of breathing (WOB), is comprised of elastic
work, which is used to expand the lungs and chest wall, and resistive work, which is used to move air through
the airways. Resistive work can be further broken down into where in the airways the resistance occurs, e.g.,
upper airway, trachea, etc. Each component of WOB is related to a specific phenotype of BPD: hyperdense lung
tissue will result in increased elastic WOB; hyperinflated airspaces indicate increased resistive WOB in the distal
airways; obstruction or collapse in the bronchi, trachea, or upper airway will result in increased resistive WOB in
each specified region. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal will validate each of these relationships between compo-
nents of WOB and phenotypes of BPD and Specific Aims 2 and 3 will assess how they change in response to
two common treatments for BPD – the bronchodilator albuterol and steroids, respectively.
This proposal is innovative in its use of a novel, neonate-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner,
which can be sited within a neonatal intensive care unit, novel MRI reconstruction techniques to assess lung
parenchymal health, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to assess respiratory airflow and re-
sistance throughout the airway tract.
We anticipate this study will result in more personalized diagnosis of premature neonates’ respiratory disease
and more precise use of drugs used to treat them. Neither albuterol or steroids are effective in all neonates and
may cause harm in some patients; for example, albuterol can exacerbate tracheal collapse by relaxing the pos-
terior tracheal membrane, while steroids pose neurodevelopmental risks. This study will identify which patients
will benefit from these treatments. In the long-term, the tools created for this study will be translated to other
respiratory diseases with multiple levels of airway obstruction and lung issues, in which the main cause of res-
piratory distress is challenging to identify, and may be used to titrate respiratory support, demonstrating the
significance of this proposal to older pediatric and adult medicine, in addition to the target neonatal population."
10858018,"Project Summary
Over 61% of adults surveyed in 2017 across 23 states experienced at least one type of adverse childhood event
(ACE). Black, Indigenous, and other Youth Of Color (BIYOC) are more likely to report having experienced four
or more types of ACEs than their White counterparts, rendering it even more critical to understand the culturally
specific protective mechanisms that buffer the negative impact of ACEs. Despite exposures to ACEs, at-risk
youth still thrive; though a clear understanding of the underlying conditions that build resilience remains widely
unknown, particularly for BIYOC youth. While the past 20 years of research has also shed light on the toll ACEs
has on adolescent psychopathology, most findings to date: (1) do not include samples from racially diverse
populations, (2) disproportionately focus on adult populations, and (3) do not capture an adequate number of
data collection timepoints from early to late adolescence. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study
started collecting data on social, behavioral, physical, and environmental factors that may affect health outcomes
in 2016, when youth (N=11,874) were between 9-10 years of age. This socio-demographically diverse national
study of 21 research sites across the U.S. entails collecting data for 10 years, until 2026. Utilizing these data,
we aim to examine the following: 1) prevalence of ACEs among BIYOC, 2) BIYOC's long-term impact of ACEs
on internalizing/externalizing behaviors from early to late adolescence, and 3) whether social supports
(caregiver, peer, neighborhood) buffer the long-term effects of exposures to ACEs on behavior. We will analyze
longitudinal data from BIYOC to identify the critical junctures by which trauma and social support impact
behavioral functioning. Relying upon a cross-lagged analytic approach, we will generate an empirical model
elucidating the extent to which social supports influence the long-term effects of exposures to ACEs on behaviors
among BIYOC. Results will identify how to cultivate and make accessible the specific types of social support that
mitigate the effects of ACEs."

Over the past twenty years, the use of prescription opioids among the American population has reached
alarming levels, with over 17% of Americans using prescription opioids annually, leading to its designation
as a public health emergency. In 2020, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified
use of opium (natural source for many opioids) as ""carcinogenic to humans"" based on evidence for causing
cancers of the lung, larynx, and bladder, and possibly pancreas and esophagus. This classification raises
major concerns on how using prescription opioids may relate to subsequent cancer risk, as they are closely
related to opium in terms of their composition and mechanisms of action.
Prior efforts to assess the link between prescription opioids and cancer in humans have been limited by the
lack of studies with prospectively collected data on both opioid use and confounders such as tobacco,
alcohol, and chronic health conditions. We initiated the pilot phase of the Opioid Cohort Consortium
(OPICO) in 2020, to overcome the existing methodological limitations by applying highly innovative multi-
disciplinary approaches to leverage and harmonize data from (1) prospective cohort studies, (2) medication
dispensing records, and (3) healthcare databases across multiple countries.
In this R01 project, we will extend OPICO to leverage and harmonize existing data from 19 sources across
the United States, Europe, and Australia to build a unique resource with high-quality data from more than
1.7 million individuals, including over 385,000 who used prescription opioids at baseline. In addition to
harmonizing data on demographics, confounders, and cancer incidence, we will use healthcare records to
assess participants’ comorbidities, and will use medication dispensing records to assess participants’ use
of prescription opioids at baseline and during follow-up.
OPICO will first address the hypothesis that use of prescription opioids is associated with increased risk for
opium-related cancers, including lung, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, and laryngeal cancers. Analyses
will assess relationships with different aspects of opioid use including their strength, duration of action, and
types. We will also assess dose-response relationships and will use multiple strategies to eliminate
confounding and indication bias. Furthermore, we will apply novel statistical methods to account for opioid
overdose deaths and variations in using prescription opioids over time.
We expect OPICO to deliver robust and conclusive evidence on the relationship between opioids and
cancer, and to generate an international resource that can support future studies on opioids and their long-
term health effects. These findings would have a significant impact on developing national prevention
strategies and targeted early detection policies to mitigate the future burden of the current opioid crisis."
10858096,"Project Summary/ Abstract
In order to do a better job identifying complex molecules with novel bioactivity and suitable bioavailability profiles,
chemists need a larger supply of promising small molecules, which requires new methods for their efficient
synthesis. However, there are many molecules of interest, both natural and non-natural, that are still difficult to
prepare with high efficiency and selectivity. Synthetic chemists are constantly searching for versatile new
methods for building densely functionalized molecules that contain vicinal chiral centers and quaternary centers.
The development of efficient, stereoselective carbon-carbon bond-forming methods will enable chemists to more
effectively prepare biologically relevant target molecules, and enable more detailed study of these compounds
for applications as chemical therapies. During this project, strategies will be developed to enable efficient,
convenient, and stereocontrolled synthesis of highly functionalized cyclic carbocycles and heterocycles from
simple precursors, with the formation of two or more carbon-carbon bonds. The new methods are expected to
deliver differentially functionalized ring systems with useful synthetic handles for further transformations. The
chemistry of various cationic intermediates will be exploited to access a series of bioactive complex molecules,
including the natural products tubingensins A and B, and polycyclic intermediates related to Daphniphyllum
alkaloid natural products.
Modern public health challenges demand a drug pipeline full of promising compounds that represent the entire
spectrum of biologically relevant small molecules. This project is expected to make an impact at the very
inception of the drug discovery process. Successful development of this versatile new method will enable for
the synthesis of small, drug-like molecules with unique shapes, and help chemists expand the catalog of
compounds available for biological evaluation. Over the course of the project, novel molecules with drug-like
properties will be synthesized, characterized, and submitted for biological evaluation through agreements with
different screening programs (NCI (both DTP and MTP), HTS facility at Roswell Cancer Center, BU-CMD (Center
for Molecular Discovery). In this way, the two- and three step methods that will be developed during these
projects, as well as the intermediates prepared during synthetic efforts toward natural product targets, will
become tools for chemists and biologists to use in their efforts to discover effective new medicines."

This proposal aims to address the critical need for cost-effective, sensitive, and accurate point-of-need
(PON) testing for infectious diseases by developing an adaptable and deployable sensing platform.
Currently available molecular diagnostic tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral
flow assays (LFA), exhibit limitations in terms of either ease of deployment or accuracy and sensitivity.
This tradeoff between accuracy and cost-effectiveness/distribution has hindered the containment of
the current pandemic and could limit our surveillance capabilities of emerging diseases. To overcome
these challenges, we propose to develop catalytic surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
sensors based on functional DNA sequences, offering several advantages over existing diagnostic
methods.
The long-term goal of this project is to create a sensing platform capable of detecting multiple genetic
biomarkers in liquid biopsies, enabling effective PON diagnostics. The proposed SERS sensors
provide highly multiplexed assays, improving accuracy in pathogen and variant identification.
Furthermore, these sensors offer quantifiable results that can be used for prognostic purposes,
enabling viral load determination. These SERS sensors are easily deployable and exhibit superior
sensitivity compared to LFA, resulting in more accurate PON diagnostic tests. In this project, we plan
to leverage inverse design and machine learning techniques to study the key functional DNA features
that influence sensor performance. The insights gained for optimal design rules will be used to
develop an automated sensor design algorithm capable of producing designs with predictable figures-
of-merit, given a target genetic code.
Additionally, we aim to exploit the reagentless feature of the sensors by developing lyophilized sensing
tablets containing all necessary components for the sensing process. These tablets enable on-
demand testing by simply adding the sample, thereby providing a practical means to administer this
one-pot SERS assay at the PON. To validate these advancements, a multiplexed assay will be
developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and validated on saliva samples containing various inactivated
viruses from different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We will test the diagnostic accuracy in the identification of
viral load and specific variants."

Sleep problems such as excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia are common in the United States. They
are found in many psychiatric and neurological disorders and cause deficits in attention, learning and memory.
Some sleep problems may be caused by disrupted circadian rhythms, but others may reflect changes in sleep
homeostasis; an enigmatic regulatory mechanism that increases sleep drive, sleep amounts and sleep
intensity as a function of prior time awake. The cellular mechanisms of sleep homeostasis are incompletely
described but have traditionally thought to be neuronal. We, however, have shown that glial astrocytes are part
of this mechanism. More specifically, we propose that sleep homeostasis arises from interactions between
astrocytes and neurons. We therefore hypothesize that the normal compensatory response to sleep loss
involves intracellular and molecular changes in astrocytes. This A1 submission has been extensively revised in
accordance with initial review. New experiments and preliminary data are included (indicated by red font).
We will test this overall hypothesis with three innovative approaches in vivo. In Aim 1, we combine genetically
encoded Ca2+ indicator (GECI) astrocyte imaging with simultaneous polysomnographic recording in
unanesthetized mice in vivo. This allows us to measure astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics in natural states of rapid-
eye-movement (REM) sleep, non(N)REM sleep and wakefulness using both 2-photon and epiflorescent
microscopy. We also more directly test the necessity of intracellular Ca2+ in sleep homeostasis by inducibly
reducing this signal in vivo and measuring changes in sleep expression and homeostasis. In Aim 2, we use
inducible molecular techniques to alter the major signaling pathways known to exist in astrocytes (i.e. Gq, Gi
and Gs proteins) and examine the resulting changes in sleep expression and homeostasis. In Aim 3, we use
next generation sequencing technology (single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)) to isolate additional (but
currently unknown) signaling pathways that are involved in astrocyte-mediated sleep homeostasis.
Mammalian astrocytes are highly diverse based on morphology, cell-specific markers (e.g. GFAP+), ion
channels, glutamate transporters and metabolic substrates. The relative contribution of these different
astrocytes to sleep is unknown. scRNA-seq provides a new and powerful method to address this problem.
Impact: Our characterization of a novel glial sleep mechanism will provide new insights into the etiology of
abnormal sleep and arousal. Our experiments will also provide new insights into the function of non-neuronal
brain cells. This in turn can lead to the development of new therapeutics that target glia, rather than neurons."

Modern genome projects have dramatically increased the amount of genetic and associated biomedical data
available to researchers. Turning the flood of data generated by rapidly evolving genomic technologies and other
biomedical data sources into actionable knowledge is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st
Century. It will take a new generation of scientists trained in the biological, mathematical, and computational
sciences to push forward our nation’s genomic agenda. It is also important to prepare a cohort of scientists with
the tools and skills they need to thrive, not only in their research and analytical endeavors, but also in their
careers and lives. Our objective is to continue to train a diverse cohort of students with the research and career
skills needed to thrive in this modern, data-driven era of biomedical research. We anticipate that our trainees will
advance biomedical knowledge and impact public health in ways that we can only dimly foresee.
The GATP is much more than a funding mechanism for our trainees. It is a program with clear research and
career training objectives and approaches. Few universities have the research infrastructure and human
resources to mount a genomic training program of the scope possible at UCLA. The convergence of cutting edge
genomic technologies, world-class computing resources, an outstanding basic and clinical research faculty, and
a highly rated educational institution allows us to attract and train students of the highest caliber.
Our proposed renewal of the Genomic Analysis Training Program will support ten predoctoral trainees per year
from a variety of disciplines. Students will be supported for two years, contingent on sustained progress in the
program and their research. Those who have completed the program will be encouraged to continue to join the
training activities throughout their time at UCLA. The program course curriculum provides a rigorous and
comprehensive foundation in the biological, computational and statistical sciences. The core curriculum includes
courses in molecular biology, human genetics, probability, statistics, bioinformatics, and biomedical ethics. To
help students build successful research careers in the current era of rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary science,
the program also emphasizes training and resources in critical communication, collaboration, and career
development skills. Our diverse training faculty come from multiple UCLA departments and disciplines; all have
strong records in both research, and mentoring students. In this renewal we have undertaken a comprehensive
evaluation of the program, using feedback from our trainees, advances in scientific knowledge, and applicable
education theory. Based on this evaluation, we have revised the program to improve the overall quality of the
training experience. We believe this will allow us to continue to produce excellent trainees who leave the program
with the knowledge and skills to pursue and support independent research careers, and train and mentor the
next generation of scientists. Our trainees will make a substantial impact on biomedical research and the nation’s
health goals for decades to come."
10862818,"Abstract
Neuroblastoma (NB) is an aggressive pediatric malignancy originating from cells of neural crest origin. NB is
among the most frequent pediatric solid tumors, with 37% of patients diagnosed as infants. Patients with high-
risk NB have a five-year survival rate of ~50% despite intensive therapy that can cause several negative
outcomes, including low body weight, hearing loss and nerve damage, death, or other sequelae. To improve
treatment for these pediatric patients, new approaches are needed. SMARCA4 (BRG1), the primary ATPase of
SWI/SNF complexes, has been identified as an oncogenic dependency for NB, with frequent gene amplifications
in advanced disease. Unfortunately, the suitability of targeting SWI/SNF ATPase activity and the mechanisms of
its inhibition in NB have remained poorly understood. We have employed new fast-acting tools to target
SMARCA4 in our preliminary data, which revealed that its inactivation induces profound loss of viability of NB
cells independently of MYCN or other cytogenetic features. We have found that inactivation of SMARCA4
induces cell death near the G1-S boundary, consistent with replication stress or cell-cycle dysregulation. In this
proposal, we seek to: (1) Map the direct cell cycle-specific effects of SWI/SNF complexes towards DNA
accessibility, transcription, and cell death; (2) Identify the mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation and replication
stress induced by SWI/SNF inhibition; and (3) Identify tumor-specific synergistic drug combinations in vitro and
validate their efficacy in vivo. We will employ a panel of drugs currently used clinically to treat high-risk NB, to
examine therapeutic synergy with SWI/SNF inhibition in 2D cells, 3D spheroids, and examine their combination
in a rigorous immune-competent mouse model of neuroblastoma. Our strategy to identify combination therapies
will be informed by a counter-screen with human neural crest and peripheral neurons, to identify drug
combinations that show minimal toxicity to non-tumor cells. Our studies will identify the principal pathways
influenced by SWI/SNF inhibition in NB related to replication stress and cell cycle dysregulation. Our findings will
furthermore enable identification and validation of therapies that potentiate SWI/SNF blockade in vivo. Because
small-molecule SWI/SNF inhibitors are well tolerated by mice, our translational studies represent an important
preclinical step that may lead to clinical trials for the 50% of unresponsive high-risk NB patients."

of Core A is to provide administrative support, financial and regulatory compliance, operational
logistics, and scientific input and oversight of the research activities performed by the five
Projects, the Data Management Core and the three Scientific Cores. Core A also will function
to strengthen communication and data sharing within the FLARE Center, within the larger
ReVAMPP network, and with other external stakeholders to ensure successful execution of the
proposed aims in a highly collaborative environment. The following services, structured into two
aims, will be provided by the Administrative Core A: (Aim 1) To provide overall grant
management for the FLARE Center, such as budgetary support and fiscal oversight for the
overall center; the nomination and establishment of a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and
coordination of their activities; in collaboration with Project and Core Leaders, assurance of
regulatory compliance as well as NIH required documentation; the development and

The Data Management Core B (hereafter, Core B) will be the nexus for all data management,
analysis, and harmonization activities in the Flavivirus and Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE)
Center. The goal of Core B is to provide the expertise and resources necessary to collect,
evaluate, analyze, and share the data generated by the multidisciplinary research studies
performed by the five Projects and three Scientific Cores in the FLARE Center. As part of the
ReVAMPP Network, the Core B also will work closely with investigators in the FLARE Center
and the ReVAMPP Coordinating and Data Sharing Center (CDSC) to facilitate data harmonization
and sharing to enhance collaboration across the entire ReVAMPP network and with other external

management systems and provide statistical analysis support for the FLARE Center. Core B will
establish and augment cloud-based data platforms (CIELO [Collaborative Informatics
Environment for Learning on Health Outcomes] and REDCap [Research Electronic Data
Capture]) for data capture, storage and sharing; develop a comprehensive quality-control system
to ensure high-quality data using prospective (quality checked in real time) and retrospective (data
cleaning) quality-control approaches; and support dissemination of results through statistical data
analysis and data visualization using SAS and R analytic platforms. The second aim will catalyze
data sharing and harmonization within the FLARE Center based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Core B will enhance data findability using built-in
and customizable features of CIELO and REDCap that facilitate searching and metadata creation
and make data publicly available in both CIELO as well as other external data repositories (e.g.,
ImmPort, NCBI Genbank and SRA, PDB, EMDB, and EMPIAR). Core B will improve data
accessibility by leveraging Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in both CIELO and
REDCap and ensure that data repositories have minimal restrictions for accessing publicly
available data (e.g., only requiring email address) and that all metadata is available on
repositories regardless of data availability. Finally, Core B will ensure data interoperability and
reusability by developing common data models and having metadata that describes usage
licenses, data provenance, and is consistent with community-accepted data standards. By
promoting and supporting the seamless exchange of high-quality data, within the FLARE Center,
across the ReVAMPP Network, and with external stakeholders and the public, Core B will play
an integral role in the development of novel immunogen designs and vaccine platforms and
monoclonal antibody therapies to be used for rapid deployment against emerging flaviviruses and

Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are emerging arthropod-borne viruses that cause severe and often life-threatening
disease in humans, and ongoing and recent epidemics have infected millions of people and threaten global
health. Currently, no specific treatment is available for any flavivirus or alphavirus, and licensed vaccines are
available for only a few flaviviruses. Given their global health burden, the worldwide spread of mosquito vectors,
and expanded global travel, there is a pressing need for the development of countermeasures against these
viruses. The major goal of the Flavivirus and Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE) Center is to establish ‘plug-and-
play’ modular platforms with optimized design technologies for vaccines and antibody therapeutics against
prototype alphaviruses and flaviviruses that can be readily applied to newly emerging related threats with
pandemic potential. Research in our Animal Vaccination, Immunogenicity and Challenge Model Core D
(hereafter, Core D) will use proven animal models for the secondary down-selection of prioritized vaccine
candidates generated by Projects 1-4 and lead monoclonal antibodies generated by Project 5 directed against
a diverse group of highly pathogenic flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses) and
alphaviruses (Chikungunya and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses) to be used as models for future
emerging agents. Core D will also support the testing of late-stage “sprints” including a vaccine against western
equine encephalitis virus and mAb combinations against Mayaro virus to validate the modular platforms. Core
D is led by Dr. Streblow with key contributions by Drs. Diamond, Klimstra, Morrison, Rossi, Freiberg, and Shresta.
This team of investigators contains the world’s leading experts in alphavirus and flavivirus animal model
development and viral pathogenesis with substantial experience in vaccine and therapeutic testing. With input
from other FLARE Center members, Core D will coordinate experimental design, animal usage, vaccine/mAb
type and dosage, sample collection and distribution as well as perform immunogenicity and challenge studies.
Core D will standardize delivery modes, challenge strains, animal care, blood draw timing and processing, and
necropsy procedures. This coordinated approach will provide the Projects with consistent data of the highest
quality that can be cross-compared. The data generated in Core D will be provided back to the Projects and
Core B as well as Core E to assess correlates of protection and identify optimal platforms and antigen designs
for preparedness against future emerging flavivirus and alphavirus pandemic threats."
10863001,"Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause epidemics
of human disease on a global scale, with new family members regularly emerging and causing
severe disease. The major goal of our Flavivrus and Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE) Center is
to establish optimized design and modular ‘plug-and-play’ technologies for vaccines and antibody
therapeutics against prototype flaviviruses and alphaviruses that can be readily applied to newly
emerging related threats in this family with pandemic potential. Research in the Correlates of
Protection Core E (hereafter, Core E) will use “state-of-the art” immune assays to evaluate
vaccine and monoclonal antibody efficacy and safety against a diverse group of highly pathogenic
flaviviruses (DENV, WNV, and TBEV) and alphaviruses (CHIKV and VEEV) as models for future
emerging agents. Core E, led by Drs. Diamond and DeSilva, with key contributions by Drs.
Cherry, Wang, Shresta, Katzelnick, and Goss, will meet this need by establishing high-throughput
virological and immunological assays to assess potency, breadth and safety of vaccine responses
and monoclonal antibodies. Core E also will leverage the testing of archived clinical specimens
from human arbovirus cohort studies and vaccine trials to validate, benchmark, and improve
existing assays, and to develop new assays. The main mission of Core E will be to support and
guide the five Research Projects and Animal Core D by functionally interrogating monoclonal
antibodies and serum samples from vaccinated animals. Core E also will perform univariate and
multivariate regression analysis on assimilated data to define key immune correlates of protection
or enhancement for different flaviviruses and alphavirus vaccine platforms. Establishing the
immune correlates of protection in animals and their relationship to humans will guide Go/No-Go
decisions in the individual Projects and inform the rapid development of protective vaccines and
antibodies against future emerging flaviviruses and alphaviruses."
10863002,"SUMMARY
Emerging and re-emerging arthropod-vectored viruses pose a significant threat to human health. Tick- and
mosquito-transmitted viruses can cause encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever leading to significant morbidity and
mortality. West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) all have tropism for
neuronal cells, which can lead to infection and injury in the central nervous system. Several emerging and re-
emerging neurotropic flaviviruses represent a growing health concern due to their epidemic potential. New
rational immunogen design strategies are necessary to elicit protective responses that confer durable protection
against current and future flavivirus threats. Project 1 of our Flavivirus and Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE)
Center uses iterative immunogen design cycles to develop, optimize, and advance next-generation vaccine
candidates using WNV and TBEV as prototype neurotropic flaviviruses. Our approaches focus on the major
surface envelope (E) glycoprotein, and we hypothesize that the structural conservation of the E glycoprotein will
enable a ‘plug and play’ modular workflow of immunogen and vaccine platform pairs that can be deployed for
other emerging or re-emerging neurotropic flaviviruses. In Aim 1, we design protein-based nanoparticles for
multivalent display of E-subdomains, E-DI and E-DIII. In Aim 2, we use protein engineering strategies to
covalently and non-covalently stabilize E dimers to display complex, conformation-specific epitopes present on
the virion that are the target of potently neutralizing and protective immune responses. In Aim 3, we implement
two immune-focusing strategies, epitope scaffolding and hyperglycosylation, to elicit responses to conserved E-
DIII epitopes. Initial down-selection will occur using protein-based immunogens with some candidates advancing
to mRNA-based delivery with our industry partner, Moderna. Vaccine candidates will be tested for
immunogenicity, antigenicity, and immune focusing with optimal candidates advancing to protection studies
using lethal WNV and TBEV murine challenge models in Aim 4. After down-selection and rigorous Go/No-Go
decision criteria, the top vaccine candidates will be transitioned to Animal Core D for further evaluation in mice
and non-human primates. Project 1 will work closely with Structural Core C to accomplish these objectives and
is conceptually and scientifically linked to FLARE Projects 2 and 3, which are focused on endemic flaviviruses
and alphaviruses, respectively."
10863003,"SUMMARY
Arthropod vector-borne flaviviruses threaten the health of people in nearly all countries of the world. Over the
past 30 years, the epidemiology of flaviviruses has been characterized by intense year-round transmission in
some areas, abrupt and permanent expansion of the range of viruses to new regions and continents, and
severe epidemics caused by viral species previously considered to be a minor nuisance. FLARE Center
Project 2 is based on our recent discovery of a structure-based method, broadly applicable to flaviviruses, for
producing highly stable, secreted envelope (E) protein homodimers displaying quaternary structure epitopes
recognized by human antibodies that strongly neutralize flaviviruses. The goal of Project 2 is to build on this
discovery and establish ‘plug and play’ modular protein subunit and mRNA vaccine platforms to counter
currently circulating and future epidemic flaviviruses. The prototype flavivirus selected for Project 2 is dengue
virus type 2 (DENV2) because this serotype, which is widely distributed, is one of the most studied flaviviruses.
Lessons learned and vaccine platforms developed for DENV2 will be applicable to closely related pathogenic
flaviviruses (e.g., other DENV serotypes and Zika virus) as well as more distantly related flaviviruses. Project
2 has three independent Aims, where each Aim is based on a single design concept for developing a modular
vaccine platform. In Aim 1, we will further improve the E homodimer technology and obtain critical non-human
primate immunogenicity and protection data required for advancement of the platform to clinical trials with our
industry partner, Moderna. Aims 2 and 3 explore new and exciting vaccine design approaches for induction
of flavivirus cross-protective immunity using antigens that display complex structural epitopes on E that require
assembly of higher order E homodimers. Project 2 is closely linked to other Projects and Cores in the FLARE
Center. Project 2 will use animal models available through Core D, up-to-date immunological assays
developed by Core E, and engage with Core C to solve the structure of vaccine antigens and explore alternate
nanoparticle vaccine delivery platforms. Project 2 also will collaborate with Project 1 to design and test E
homodimer vaccines for flaviviruses that are distantly related to the DENV complex, and Project 5 to develop
DENV serotype cross-protective therapeutic mAbs."
10858810,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While extinction learning can reduce excessive fear characteristic of anxiety-based disorders like post-traumatic
stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, behavioral inhibition achieved through extinction is highly
susceptible to relapse. This is because extinction functions to create a new inhibitory memory while leaving the
original fear memory largely unaltered and intact. We have recently identified and characterized behaviorally a
novel approach to behavioral reduction that seems to circumvent the behavioral relapse common to extinction.
In this procedure, weak versions of the fear-provoking unconditional stimulus are presented to alter the
representation of that fearful stimulus to ultimately weaken fear responding to cues previously associated with
it. The present proposal aims to expand on our understanding of this phenomenon and apply it to novel situations
to reduce behavioral relapse following fear-reducing procedures. Our overarching hypothesis is that
unconditional stimulus deflation will be distinct from extinction at the behavioral, circuit, cellular, and molecular
levels and will be tested in three complementary but independent aims. In Aim 1, we will first directly compare
UCS deflation to extinction in the three most commonly-studied relapse paradigms: renewal, spontaneous
recovery, and reinstatement with the prediction that UCS deflation, but not extinction, will reduce all three types
of relapse. Then, we will test the requirement for neural activity in the IL BLA pathway during UCS deflation in
creating these long-lasting reductions in fear responding using an optogenetic approach. In Aim 2, we will
examine the degree to which extinction and deflation activate the original memory ensemble using a robust
activity marker (RAM) approach. Here, our prediction is that UCS deflation will preferentially activate the memory
ensemble tagged during acquisition, with less activation of this ensemble in extinction learning. We will then
quantify the degree to which the original training ensemble is activated following renewal testing. Here, we
hypothesize more overlap between the neural ensemble in renewal following extinction than following UCS
deflation. Finally, we will test the prediction that the ubiquitin proteasome system will have a unique role in UCS
deflation but not extinction. First, we will examine changes in nuclear and synaptic K48 polyubiquitin tagging
following UCS deflation or extinction with the prediction that UCS deflation will produce changes in the synapse
indicative of memory retrieval and updating whereas extinction will produce changes in the nucleus indicative of
new memory formation. We will then test the hypothesis that blocking proteolytic activity will impair UCS deflation
but not extinction using an intracranial approach. These studies will be the first to examine how UCS deflation
functions to reduce fear across multiple levels of analysis (behavioral, circuit, cellular, and molecular). Further,
they will provide detailed mechanistic insight and identify specific targets through which UCS deflation can
weaken the original learning to persistently reduce fear and render this reduction less susceptible to relapse."
10858818,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of this proposal is to utilize quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to establish a clinically
feasible, accurate, and robust treatment biomarker for chronic inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic
active lesions (CALs) characterized by persistent smoldering inflammation significantly contribute to
progressive cognitive and ambulatory decline in MS. Within a subset of CALs, a distinct subgroup has been
identified as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs), where iron-laden pro-inflammatory immune cells are localized at
the edge of the lesion. Leveraging the quantitative capabilities of QSM, we have made a significant observation
regarding the inflammatory trajectory of PRLs. These lesions exhibit an initial increase in susceptibility,
followed by a subsequent decrease, signifying the transition from a chronic active to a chronic inactive MS
lesion. Notably, our findings have also indicated that QSM can detect the longitudinal susceptibility changes in
PRLs resulting from the administration of current disease modifying therapies. Building on our promising
preliminary data, our primary objectives are as follows: 1) develop a high-resolution, clinically feasible
approach to accurately detect PRLs and identify their iron source; 2) provide in vivo validation for precise
detection and quantification of inflammatory changes within individual PRLs; 3) identify existing disease-
modifying therapies that target innate immune burden within lesions and 4) establish the positive impact of
reducing inflammation in PRLs on clinical disability. To achieve these objectives, we have developed the
Learned Acquisition and Reconstruction Optimization (LARO) approach, enabling rapid high-resolution QSM
for PRL detection. We have also implemented a QSM post-processing method to eliminate the confounding
effect of myelin, thereby enhancing rim iron detection sensitivity and quantification accuracy. In Aim 1, we
hypothesize that these advancements in QSM technology will enhance PRL detection. Similarly, in Aim 2, we
anticipate that our new approach will enable accurate quantification of the longitudinal inflammatory trajectory
in PRLs, which we will validate through longitudinal in vivo monitoring of inflammation using TSPO PET. By
building upon our preliminary work, in Aim 3, we will identify and evaluate current therapies that can effectively
benefit patients with PRLs lesions, thereby advancing QSM as a treatment biomarker to target innate immune
activity within chronic lesions. The overall impact of this proposal is to provide an innovative treatment target
for chronic innate immune activity in MS, resulting in a paradigm shift in the care of patients with MS."
10834736,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate patient-specific computational models of cochlear
implant (CI) stimulation and to use these models to create patient-customized, MOdel-based CI Programming
(MOCIP) strategies that optimize implant performance. CIs are a neuroprosthetic devices that use an array of
implanted electrodes to stimulated the auditory nerve and induce hearing sensation. With over 500,000 recipients
worldwide, CI are considered the standard of care treatment for severe-to-profound sensory-based hearing loss.
While results with these devices have been remarkably successful, a significant number of CI recipients
experience poor speech understanding, and, even among the best performers, restoration to normal auditory
fidelity is rare. It is estimated that only 5% of those who could benefit from this technology pursue implantation,
in large part due to the high-degree of uncertainty in outcomes. A substantial portion of the variability in outcomes
with CIs is due to a sub-optimal electro-neural interface (ENI); however, approaches for estimating the patient-
specific ENI have thus far been unreliable.
 The overarching hypothesis of this study is that an accurate estimation of the patient-specific ENI can be
obtained with patient-specific computational models and used to customize CI settings for improved and less
variable implant performance. To test this hypothesis, first, novel image processing and patient-specific
anatomical models, which are tuned using biofeedback signals and permit estimating the ENI by determining
which auditory nerve fibers are healthy and localizing which nerve fibers are stimulated by each electrode, will
be developed and validated. Next, the performance of patient-customized MOCIP strategies that aim to address
sub-optimal conditions found in the ENI will be clinically tested. Finally, MOCIP techniques will be automated
and integrated into software that can be deployed into the clinical workflow. Since MOCIP strategies require only
a change of settings on the CI, they work with existing device technology, do not require further surgery, and are
reversible. If successful, a suite of MOCIP techniques that can objectively guide the programming of CIs towards
optimized settings and improve hearing restoration for new and existing CI recipients will be developed in this
project."
10834025,"The overall goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms of maternal immune tolerance to the fetus in pregnancy. The intimacy between the maternal immune system and the fetal allograft is an unparalleled physiological situation in which antigenically unique, tissue-specific proteins are introduced to the mother’s immune system at the commencement and for the duration of pregnancy. When this tolerance fails, infertility, preterm birth and delivery, preeclampsia, or fetal growth restriction may result. Aire is a transcriptional regulator that induces expression of tissue-restricted genes in the thymus, wherein central tolerance to many self-antigens is acquired. Aire ensures that tolerance to such antigens is established in developing T cells. Tissue-restricted genes regulated by Aire include many that are specific to the fetus and placenta, and we have found not only that Aire is upregulated in the thymus during pregnancy, but also that global Aire deficiency can predispose dams to fetal loss. Intriguingly, our group and others have also identified Aire expression in the ovary and uterus, suggesting an additional, extrathymic role of this transcription factor. In this project, we aim to define the role of Aire in immune tolerance to the fetus, elucidate its regulation by sex hormones, and clarify its immune- independent role in reproduction. We will test the overall hypothesis that Aire is required for central immune tolerance the fetus, and that it functions in parallel within the uterus and ovary to support fertility. We propose two specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the impact of Aire deficiency on maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Aim 2. Ascertain the functional connection between sex hormones and Aire in maternal central tolerance to the fetus. Aim 3. Identify the immune-independent function of Aire in female fertility. The results of these experiments are expected to provide highly novel insight into as-yet unexplored mechanisms of maternal tolerance to the fetal-placental unit, female fertility, and the regulation thereof by sex hormones, greatly advancing our understanding of maternal tolerance to the fetal allograft. The results will have far-reaching implications for women’s wellbeing in the fields of pregnancy, reproductive health, autoimmune disease, transplantation, and cancer immunology."
10834026,"Transport proteins in the liver play a critical role in drug disposition and interindividual variability in medication
response. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence hepatic transporter function. Understanding these
factors, and the mechanisms involved, is fundamental to improving the safety and efficacy of drug therapy. The
overall goals of my research program are to elucidate mechanisms of hepatic transport and further develop
strategies to assess and predict the impact of altered hepatic transporter function on drug disposition to improve
therapeutic outcomes. My laboratory has pioneered the development of in vitro tools to quantify hepatic drug
disposition and biliary excretion, devised novel strategies to address key scientific questions regarding hepatic
drug transport, and investigated the interplay between bile acids (BAs) and hepatic efflux transporters. Supported
by an NIGMS MIRA grant, we established the importance of the human organic solute transporter alpha/beta
(OSTα/β) in maintaining hepatic BA homeostasis and developed new in vitro methods to investigate drug
substrates and inhibitors of OSTα/β, uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms of hepatic transporters, and
advanced transporter science by developing in silico models to predict the clinical impact of altered drug
transport. However, many important questions remain unanswered. What alternative mechanisms of
transporter regulation impact hepatic drug disposition? We will continue to uncover novel mechanisms of
transporter regulation. Using our optimized in vitro system, we will identify drugs that alter cellular trafficking of
transporters, elucidate transporter-mediated drug interactions (tDIs) involving modulation of phosphorylation
sites in transporters, and evaluate the impact of these changes on hepatic transporter function. Which emerging
in vitro liver systems can advance our understanding of hepatic transporter mechanisms? We will assess
hepatic transport in 3D liver organoid and liver-on-a-chip systems, optimize transporter expression, localization,
and function in these systems, and develop strategies to use these systems to inform in silico models to improve
predictions of drug disposition and tDIs. What role do cholangiocyte transporters play in hepatic drug
disposition and tDIs? Cholangiocytes express hepatic drug and BA transporters, and are critical in hepatic BA
regulation. We will define the contribution of cholangiocyte transporters and the hepatocyte-cholangiocyte
interplay in drug disposition and tDIs. Incorporation of cholangiocytes into in vitro liver systems may further
enhance predictions. Can novel tools improve transporter function assessment and predict hepatic drug
disposition in vivo? We will continue mechanistic studies to elucidate factors that impact the use of endogenous
biomarkers for tDI studies, and explore hepatocyte-derived exosomes as a noninvasive method to quantify
hepatic transporter phenotype. Development of novel mechanistic, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic, and
quantitative systems pharmacology models informed by in vitro data will more accurately predict the impact of
altered hepatic transport on drug disposition. This information is critical to optimize therapeutic outcomes."
10834128,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of this K99/R00 application is to provide support for Dr. Vienna Brunt, a promising postdoctoral
fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Douglas Seals, to conduct additional research and training that will allow her to
successfully transition into an independent investigator in the field of translational cardiovascular aging and the
prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). As part of her proposed K99 training plan, she will learn new
technical skills, enhance her intellectual and professional skills, gain valuable mentorship and participate in
various career development activities, including those that will help establish her as a leader in the field of gut
microbiome-related cardiovascular research. Her proposed research project seeks to investigate the effects of
oral supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on improving age-related arterial dysfunction
(i.e., the primary risk factor for CVD), first in mice (K99 phase) and later in humans (R00 phase). Short-chain
fatty acids are byproducts of gut microbiome-dependent fermentation of dietary soluble fiber and are thought to
mediate many of the health benefits of high-fiber diets. Guided by strong preliminary data, Dr. Brunt will first
(Aim 1) confirm efficacy of acetate supplementation for improving arterial function in old mice. With guidance
and training in technical skills from leading experts in mechanistic cardiovascular research, she will then (Aim
2) conduct innovative siRNA experiments in both mouse isolated arteries and cultured endothelial cells to
determine the mechanisms of acetate-mediated improvements in arterial function, specifically the roles of free
fatty acid receptor (FFAR)3 and downregulation of the cardiopathological transcription factor early growth
response-1 (Egr-1). After transitioning to a faculty position, Dr. Brunt will next (Aim 3; R00 phase) translate her
findings to humans by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial
in late middle-aged to older (³50 years) adults investigating the effects of 12 weeks of oral supplementation
with acetate on arterial function. She will also use cutting-edge in vivo and ex vivo approaches to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms. Overall, the proposed research has the potential to address 2 important strategic
research priorities of NHLBI: 1) investigate new pathobiological mechanisms important to the onset of CVD,
and 2) identify a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat age-associated arterial dysfunction, thereby
reducing risk of CVD. The proposed research will provide numerous ideas and opportunities for future fundable
research, culminating in submission of a novel R01 during years 4-5 of this award. The primary mentor, Dr.
Seals, is an internationally-recognized and NIH funded scientist with a strong history of successful mentoring in
translational cardiovascular research. With his guidance and the guidance of co-mentor Dr. Leslie Leinwand,
advisory team members Drs. Mike Widlansky, Dr. Rob Knight, and Michel Chonchol, and biostatistician Dr.
Zhiying You, Dr. Brunt will be able to successfully complete the proposed research and training plan and

Lockdowns and other public health measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
have had profound social and economic consequences. In the United States, over 10 million jobs have
been lost in 2020, and some regions, industries, and demographic groups have been particularly hard hit.
Moreover, lockdowns have substantially limited the capacity for in-person social interaction with close
others and “weak ties,” peripheral members of our social network who contribute to everyday well-being.
These kinds of regularized social interactions have potent effects on mental health. Thus, it is especially
important to understand the broader contextual forces that influence them. In social-contextual
environments that are more trusting and cooperative, social-affiliative behavior is more likely to result
from economic stress, leading to increased capacities for stress resistance. By contrast, social-contextual
environments that are perceived as less trusting and cooperative may inhibit the use of social affiliation,
depriving people of a potent source of emotion regulation and well-being. The proposed project will
examine the interplay of broader social-contextual factors and individual social behaviors in response to
COVID-19-related economic stress. A multilevel longitudinal framework will be used in conjunction with
a quasi-experimental design involving COVID-19 economic impact (High vs. Low) and social capitol
(High vs. Low). This work can provide crucial insight into the economic impact of COVID-19 with
substantial implications for the mental health and happiness of human beings across the globe."

in 2011 and 2016. The program is designed to provide short-term experience and training in
biomedical research for undergraduate students from racial/ethnic-underrepresented groups, and for
students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Since 2016, the program has been jointly based at the
University of Texas Long School of Medicine in San Antonio and the Penn State College of Medicine
in Hershey, PA under the direction of W. Brian Reeves, MD, Chair of Medicine at UTHSA and Gail
Matters, PhD, Associate Professor at Penn State. The program has made targeted recruitment efforts
through several minority student organizations which have resulted in a large increase in the number
of applications received. Applications exceed available positions by a 5:1 ratio. The outcomes of the
program have been excellent. 244 students have matriculated through the Penn State STEP-UP
program since its inception with over 75% of students continuing on to higher education in biomedical
fields and an additional 15% are employed in biomedical fields. The current proposal builds on the
successes of the current STEP-UP program and significantly expands the mentoring activities to
provide more sustained, year round, support to the students. The plan provides background and
hands-on experience in research related to the mission of NIDDK. The plan also provides for technical
advising and mentoring of students during their hands-on research experience at a summer-end
research symposium and during the subsequent academic year. The aims of the proposal are: 1.
Provide a hands-on research experience through which students will learn how discovery, clinical and
translational research are conducted and the results are disseminated to others. 2. Provide year round
research experiences, mentoring and career development activities to enhance entry and retention of
students in biomedical research. The curriculum will also include discussions on normative standards
of conduct, privacy and confidentiality issues, laboratory safety, research integrity, record keeping,
data management, and communication skills. Although the primary goal of this proposal is to increase
the number and competence of members of underrepresented groups in biomedical research, an
important secondary benefit is to expand the proportion of underrepresented population who
understand that life-style decisions have great consequences for their personal health and that of their
family, friends and community."
10831474,"Project Summary: Most genetic variants associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
lie in non-coding gene regulatory elements (GRE; e.g., promoters and enhancers). GREs are tissue- and cell
type-specific and are identified through their epigenomic signatures, including low DNA methylation (DNAm),
DNA accessibility and certain histone modifications. The PsychENCODE Consortium has characterized brain
GREs across brain regions and developmental time points, as well as in the brains of psychiatric patients using
mostly DNA accessibility and histone modification marks. These marks, however, identify large regions of
enrichment (~300-2,000bp), providing only low resolution coverage of the important regulatory nucleotides, e.g.,
transcription factor binding sites. DNAm (especially cell type-specific DNAm) has received less attention,
although it has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD).
 In the adult human brain, ~80% of CG and 1.5% of non-CG (CH) sites are methylated, and can be converted
to hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further demethylated. In postmitotic neuronal genomes, mCH and hmC
accumulate to a significantly higher level than in other tissues--a distinct feature of the brain's epigenome.
Bisulfite sequencing (BS)-based approaches that are used to measure (h)mC can pinpoint GREs with single
base resolution, presenting a unique opportunity to refine the gene regulatory landscape of the brain cell types.
 Here we aim to create reference DNAm maps [mC and hmC, using BS and oxidative (ox)BS sequencing]
and transcriptional profiles (using RNA-seq) in two major subtypes of neurons in the human dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), namely excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons. The
proposed work is based on fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) methods that we recently developed
to separate nuclei of different cell types from autopsied human brain, and on our recent findings that showed
unexpected relationships between DNA(h)m, GREs, and gene expression in the DLPFC Glu and GABA neurons.
 We will perform these studies at key time points of postnatal brain development and adulthood to map
DNA(h)m within active neuron subtype-specific GREs that may be vulnerable to disruption during childhood and
adolescence periods that coincide with the critical processes of brain maturation and circuit refinement (Aim 1).
This work will be complemented with single nucleus mC profiling, which will allow us to define the developmental
trajectories of mC in discrete subpopulations of Glu and GABA neurons (Aim2).
 Finally, we will profile Glu and GABA neurons in 150 autopsied DLPFC samples obtained from controls and
cases of SZ and BD, and will then map neuron subtype-specific gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation
quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTLS, hmQTLs) (Aim3). We will integrate QTL, transcriptome, and DNA(h)m data
with the results of SZ and BP GWAS to reveal DNA(h)m and gene expression-mediated causal risk variants and
genes, and to distinguish specific neuronal subtype(s) that are critical in the etiology of these disorders."
10831477,"SUMMARY:
 Animals modulate their behaviors with social experience to increase fitness. The molecular and neural
circuit-based mechanisms underlying social experience-dependent behavioral modulation remains unclear.
Emerging evidence indicates the intimate connection among sensory experience, chromatin and behavioral
modifications. Defects in chromatin modulation are associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders.
Understanding the role of chromatin in regulating behaviors requires model systems with identified genes and
neural circuits with clear causal links to stereotyped behaviors. The Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent
model where these links were well elucidated for courtship behaviors. In D. melanogaster, Fruitless (Fru) and
Doublesex (Dsx) are master transcriptional regulators that control innate and learned sex-specific courtship
behaviors, respectively. fru is expressed in 2000 interconnected neurons marking courtship circuits. Socially
isolated wild type males show elevated courtship compared to grouped males. Conversely, socially isolated fruM
mutant males do not court, however, if grouped, they use olfaction to learn to court either males or females. This
learning requires the gene dsx, which is co-expressed with fru in decision-making neurons of courtship circuits.
How social experience regulates fru and dsx expression in the courtship circuits to modify circuit function remains
unknown. In published and preliminary data, we demonstrated that social experience and pheromone signaling
induces chromatin-based reprogramming of fru and dsx expression in the peripheral and central courtship
circuits. We also found that social cues change Fru target neuromodulatory gene expression in the peripheral
neurons, which alter neuronal sensitivity and circuit function. We hypothesize that detection of social signals
reprograms chromatin around behavioral switch genes such as Fru and Dsx in the central brain, which
in turn modulate circuit function and behaviors. To test this, we propose to identify social experience and
pheromone signaling-dependent changes in chromatin around fru and dsx genes, their effects on downstream
target gene expression, circuit function and behavioral outputs."

ions down their electrochemical gradients to transduce chemical, mechanical, and optical

allosteric gating mechanisms in two subfamilies of TRP ion channels, TRPV1-2 and TRPM2.
TRP channels are famous for their multimodal gating whereby stimulus modalities as diverse as
heat, cold, ions, lipids, nutrients, other proteins, and a variety of natural products (e.g.,
capsaicin, menthol) are allosterically integrated to determine the activity of a central ion-

solve pressing questions in TRP channel biology. Our long-term vision is to understand the
general themes that underlie allosteric conformational transitions in ion channels. Our recent

capsaicin, menthol) are allosterically integrated to determine the activity of a central ion-
conducting pore. Each stimulus modality regulates the conformational energetics of a sensing
module. The sensing modules in turn regulate the conformational energetics and conductance
of the pore. The sensing modules may be coupled to the pore, to each other, or both. TRP
channels provide an ideal system in which to decipher how allosteric conformational energetics
produce protein function because they are regulated by many stimulus modalities, and we have
significant understanding of the correspondence between their structural domains and sensing
modules. The goal of this proposal is to measure, for the first time, the conformational
energetics of TRP channel sensing domains and their coupling to the pore and to each other to
solve pressing questions in TRP channel biology. Our long-term vision is to understand the
general themes that underlie allosteric conformational transitions in ion channels. Our recent
technical advances combining fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and patch-
clamp electrophysiology to measure conformational energetics in the pore and a sensing
module simultaneously promise rapid progress toward this goal."

This project will establish and implement the Brooklyn Clinical Research Site (Bklyn CRS) of the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) and support its mission to advance the clinical, behavioral, and
epidemiological science of newly diagnosed and chronic HIV infection and associated comorbidities. The Bklyn
CRS evolves from and builds upon a 25-year history of scientific innovation accompanied by community
engagement that facilitated rigorous implementation of the Brooklyn Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS).
The Bklyn CRS will rapidly develop a diverse cohort of men and women reflecting the unique characteristics of
HIV in our geographic area. We will include continued follow-up of WIHS participants, who contribute a rich
longitudinal history of clinical, biologic, genetic, psychosocial and behavioral data derived from midlife and
younger ages, informing questions of HIV and aging in an older population. The Bklyn CRS investigators will
develop and implement protocols of the MACS/WIHS CCS Unified Science Agenda, contribute to the overall
functioning of the administrative infrastructure, and engage a strong and multidisciplinary team of researchers
in addressing innovative science.
Our specific aims are to: 1) recruit and retain a prospective cohort of 500 men and women living with HIV and
matched seronegative controls and implement MACS/WIHS CCS study protocols; 2) engage a
multidisciplinary and experienced team of scientists to develop and implement innovative research that aligns
with and advances the CCS Unified Science Agenda; and 3) provide training and career development
opportunities to support advancement of the next generation of HIV researchers.
The Bklyn CRS provides scientific, administrative and collaborative leadership in cardiovascular disease and
associated lung and sleep outcomes; aging via physical, functional and molecular assessments; psychological
and social environmental aspects of self-management of HIV and associated co-morbidities; and
neurocognition and brain aging. As such, the Bklyn CRS will greatly enhance the MACS/WIHS CCS, ensuring
the rigor and relevance of study questions and methods to address those questions."

Despite the high rates of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) (up to 50%) and their related
mortality/morbidity following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), there remains a paucity
of therapies and biological correlative studies offered. Current therapies are limited to the nonspecific steroidal
targeting of effector cells. Our long-term goal is to identify and validate GVHD biomarkers with the potential for
risk stratification and therapeutic targeting. In the previous cycle, we discovered that: (1) soluble STimulation-2
(sST2), the interleukin-33 (IL-33) decoy receptor, as a biomarker for risk of therapy-resistant GVHD and death
(N. Engl. J. Med, 2013); (2) Mechanistically, we have shown that during GVHD, sST2 was secreted earlier by
intestinal stromal cells and later by cytopathic intestinal T effector cells (Teffs) (Science Translational Medicine,
2015); (3) Furthermore, we have shown that sST2 sequesters IL-33, limiting its availability to T cells expressing
the transmembrane molecule form of ST2, mostly cytoprotective regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Science
Translational Medicine, 2015; Journal of Clinical Investigation Insights, 2019); (4) Through another proteomics
discovery comparing samples at 14 days post-transplantation in patients who develop gastrointestinal (GI)
GVHD vs not, we found a T-cell population expressing CD146 that is Th17 prone and ICOS (Inducible T-cell
COStimulator)-induced (Journal of Clinical Investigation Insights, 2016). Our new hypotheses address gaps
remaining and will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
anti-ST2 neutralizing antibody mediated regulation of inflammation; 2) Implement a prospective multicenter
study to determine ST2 threshold as a prognostic biomarker of aGVHD for enabling a biomarker-based
preemptive trial; and 3) Inhibit the ICOS/ICOSL pathway with a dual ICOS/CD28 antagonist to prevent and
treat aGVHD. The proposed research is significant because the impact of these studies will be 1) to risk stratify
patients before initiating GVHD treatment, and 2) to develop entirely novel therapeutic strategies while
simultaneously providing novel biological insights into a fatal condition, GVHD."
10832072,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective in treating metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (PADC), but all
patients inevitably relapse with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Most CRPCs remain dependent on
androgen receptor (AR) signaling, but a significant fraction lack AR expression, become AR signaling
independent, and aberrantly express neuroendocrine lineage markers (NEPC). The incidence of NEPC
variants among CRPC has increased as more patients benefit from improved ADTs like enzalutamide and
abiraterone acetate. This suggests increasingly stringent AR signaling blockade is driving development of
NEPC. This is an important clinical problem because NEPC is aggressive and lethal; development of effective
therapies is hampered by limited understanding of relevant molecular mechanisms. NEPC clearly arises from
ARpos CRPC as they share clonal origin in patients that harbor both. We have determined that genetic
inactivation of the RB1/TRP53 tumor suppressor genes cooperate to facilitate transformation of ARpos PADC to
NEPC through derepression of epigenetic reprogramming factors. Inhibiting these reprogramming factors
reverses NEPC transformation and restores ADT sensitivity, demonstrating that epigenetic changes are
involved. We hypothesize that a change in NOTCH-ASCL1 signaling triggers the epigenetic
reprogramming underlying NEPC transformation. This hypothesis has clinical ramifications as the pathway
could conceivably be manipulated therapeutically to delay or reverse NEPC transformation, extending the
duration of beneficial ADT clinical responses in some patients. We propose three specific aims using novel
prostate cancer mouse models and unique human clinical specimens to test this hypothesis, characterize how
PADC cells transform into NEPC cells, and explore novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this
lethal form of prostate cancer. We will: 1) Test if NOTCH signaling is sufficient to maintain an androgen
dependent PADC phenotype; 2) Characterize how prostate cancer cells transition from PADC to NEPC; 3)
Determine whether epigenetic modulating drugs reverse NEPC transformation and ADT resistance via
NOTCH-ASCL1 signaling. The long term goal of this project is to improve prostate cancer therapy by
advancing mechanistic understanding of lineage plasticity as a mechanism of acquired therapeutic resistance."
10832074,"Project Summary / Abstract
This project will conduct early-stage development of a paper-based device to facilitate the efficient
recovery of high-quality nucleic acids from breastmilk for use in breast cancer risk assessment, detection
of occult disease, and epidemiologic studies designed to uncover the earliest events in the development of
breast cancer. Collecting breastmilk, which contains millions of epithelial cells from the mammary
gland, is the only noninvasive method of obtaining breast tissue. Current breastmilk collection methods
require expensive overnight shipping of breastmilk on ice and greatly limit studies using this important
biospecimen. The proposed device will facilitate the collection and loading of breastmilk on a small paper
card that can be sent through the mail and stored flat at room temperature for long periods of time, or
indefinitely, allowing subsequent recovery of nucleic acids. Because specimens can be loaded by women
in the privacy of their homes, and because the device is paper-based and inexpensive, we anticipate it will
facilitate collection of nucleic acids from the breast cells of large numbers of women in diverse geographic
locations.
While the breastmilk-collection device is inspired by blood-collection cards, it is designed to process
substantially larger volumes of breastmilk, needed to obtain a large quantity of nucleic acids required for
cancer risk assessment. The device therefore will accomplish several functions: the manipulation of
breastmilk into the paper through capillary action, the separation of excess fluid into a disposable layer
and the retention of a nucleic-rich fraction within the primary device matrix. Removal of the excess fluid
volume will expedite subsequent drying of the captured fluid and simplify transport in the event the user
cannot thoroughly dry the card before transport. The device will additionally incorporate preservatives
into the specimen to facilitate long term stability at room temperature. This program focuses on the
design of the device to facilitate retention of nucleic acids and any cells (also containing nucleic acids)
remaining unlysed in the processing window, at the same time removing excess fluid from this
component of the device. As we target a paper-based matrix, the proposed studies will focus on
evaluating the interaction of breastmilk with papers of varied pore size and surface chemistry with and
without added preservatives. These studies will enable the prioritization of materials for different
components of the device, a working configuration for the layers and other device features, and
accelerated testing to gauge the impact of extreme transport and storage temperatures."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer and cancer mortality in the U.S., with
significant differences in outcomes in historically marginalized populations. Black individuals have the highest
mortality rate for CRC; half of the disparity has been associated with lower screening rates. CRC screening is
recommended by the United States Preventative Services Task Force for adults age 45-75. Patient navigation
is an evidence-based strategy to increase screening rates among racial and ethnic minorities. While patient
navigation is an evidence-based approach to improve screening, there is a gap in understanding the multi-level
influences on implementation of such programs across primary care practices, particularly using a health-
equity focused, stakeholder-centered approach. Our long-term goal is to promote health equity through
understanding contextual factors including system and interpersonal racism and implementation strategies
needed to implement patient navigation across primary care settings with diverse racial and ethnic populations.
We propose mixed methods along with an advisory board comprised of community organizations to iteratively
adapt the patient navigation intervention to consider the patient population, the clinical workflows and staffing,
and the community context. Guided by the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM)
and core health and racial equity principles, we aim to increase reach of patient navigation and show
effectiveness through improvement in the percentage of Black and Hispanic patients completing CRC
screening. We will also utilize longitudinal tracking of implementation strategies to better track implementation
or intervention adaptations navigation delivery in order to inform future scale up. We will conduct a stepped-
wedged, randomized trial to roll out patient navigation and patient and provider reminders across 15 clinics (3
clinics per step, 5 six-month steps). Implementation strategies will include assessing for readiness, audit and
feedback, building a community coalition, engaging consumers, modifying referral tracking, and training and
educating clinical stakeholders. We will use the electronic health record data with consideration for the
Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model, additional patient-reported data,
and study tracking logs to measure reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation (fidelity, feasibility,
acceptability, appropriateness), and will use qualitative measures and site observations to document
contextual factors, including examination of discrimination in patient experiences and provider referral patterns
that may influence intervention delivery or CRC screening completion. Partnership with the National Committee
on Quality Assurance (NCQA) will further allow us to examine sustainability of a community-engaged model for
delivery of evidence-based interventions."
10832577,"Project Summary
 Latino immigrants experience numerous disparities in the receipt of routine health care. They may be at
risk for significant poor outcomes from cancer; however, the extent to which Latino immigrants experience
appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared with US born-Latinos and non-Hispanic
whites, is not well understood. This may be, in part, because studying the health care of Latino immigrants has
numerous challenges. Foreign-born status is not widely and routinely collected, and foreign-born patients may
not have the access to healthcare related datasets that would objectively record their healthcare utilization.
Additionally, while there is some scientific evidence that different sub groups of immigrants (Mexican
individuals, for instance, Spanish speaking individuals, rural- residing immigrants) may utilize services
differently in general than contrasting groups, the knowledge on these differences is incomplete because
studies to date have failed to include all necessary data to understand these relationships.
 In order to better understand cancer prevention disparities between foreign-born Latinos, US-born
Latinos, and non-Hispanic Whites, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of
community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social
determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains country of birth for >100,000 Latinos and
also contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities and better understand which
specific groups are most at risk for the under-utilization of cancer prevention. Understanding these factors that
most heavily impact cancer preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of population-based
interventions to improve cancer outcomes.
 This research will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will help clinical providers understand
their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that
influence their Latino immigrant patients' utilization of recommended cancer prevention services. 2. It will
facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in
social factors in the lives of Latino immigrants. 3. It will enable more informed policy decisions to improve
public health and wellness in foreign born Latinos."
10832579,"Relapse to cocaine use remains a significant challenge in the treatment of cocaine addiction, yet our
understanding of those neural systems that enable individuals to inhibit cocaine seeking and relapse remains
poor. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the neural circuits and the changes in those circuits that
underlie the inhibition of cocaine-seeking behavior, using rat models of cocaine seeking. The current proposal
builds upon the findings we have obtained in recent years as well as new approaches we have developed in
our laboratory. In our studies, rats undergo cocaine self-administration, extinction training and reinstatement
testing of their cocaine seeking. We have found that the infralimbic cortex is a central component of the
systems involved in the extinction and inhibition of cocaine-seeking behavior. Activity in the infralimbic cortex is
necessary for the normal encoding of the extinction learning as well as extinction expression. For example,
infralimbic activation inhibits cocaine seeking following extinction training. However, the larger circuit in which
the infralimbic cortex performs these functions remains unclear. In particular, as evidence suggests functional
heterogeneity within the infralimbic cortex in terms of its role in cocaine seeking, understanding the larger
circuitry may provide insight into these issues. The proposed work will focus on the specific pathways
projecting into and out of the infralimbic that account for its role in extinction and inhibition of cocaine seeking.
The work will include approaches that have not, to our knowledge, been used in studies of cocaine seeking
and, therefore, will enable notable progress in our knowledge of these systems. In particular, our studies will
use multi-site recordings of neural activity during cocaine seeking to understand how a network of brain
regions coordinates behavior. Moreover, the proposed studies will use optogenetic approaches to examine
how different pathways mediate different aspects of the extinction and inhibition of cocaine seeking. The
findings from this work will reveal those specific pathways and network activity related to the IL with regard to
the extinction/inhibition of cocaine seeking. Furthermore, the proposed work will both 1) examine changes in
IL-based circuits as a consequence of cocaine self-administration and extinction and 2) manipulate these
circuits to determine how they functionally control the inhibition of cocaine seeking. The findings from the
studies will furnish critical new basic knowledge of the neural systems underlying the suppression of cocaine
seeking that will potentially lead to the development of more effective treatments that strengthen such systems
in cocaine-addicted individuals."

motors help to establish polarity by transporting mRNAs, proteins, vesicles, and organelles to specific sites
within the cell. A variety of organisms from the single-celled yeast to humans use mRNA localization coupled
with translational regulation as a way to asymmetrically sort proteins. The prevalence of this phenomenon is
best illustrated in developing embryos, neurons and epithelial, in which thousands of mRNAs are spatially
localized. When this process is compromised, it can result in developmental and neurological disorders.
Despite the importance of this topic and the prevalence of this phenomenon, we lack a mechanistic
understanding of mRNA localization. A critical gap in our understanding pertains to how mRNAs destined for
localization are recognized by the cell and distinguished from non-localizing mRNAs. In addition to sequences
present within localizing mRNAs, the proteins that bind these mRNAs are key to their cellular fate. This
complex of proteins is responsible for linking localizing mRNAs with molecular motors and for regulating their
translation. However, identifying these critical proteins has proven to be extremely challenging. By its very
nature, the process of mRNA localization is highly dynamic. Consequently, the protein-protein and protein-RNA
interactions required for assembling localizing messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles are weak and
transient. This has made their identification using classical biochemical approaches almost impossible; the
complex falls apart during the purification step. In this application, we propose novel strategies to address this
critical knowledge gap. The model we propose to use for these studies is the well-characterized Drosophila
melanogaster egg chamber. In Objective 1 of this application, we propose to use proximity biotin ligation to
define the core components of transport particles and to examine the conservation of these factors between
flies and mammals. In Objective 2, we propose to test the hypothesis that granular structures referred to as P
bodies coordinate the localization of mRNAs with their translational regulation."

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has garnered significant interest over the past two decades as a robust and
unique form of plasticity in a region critical for learning and memory. It has also proven to be fertile ground for
understanding fundamental principles of stem cell biology, neuronal development, as well as illustrating the
capacity of the mature brain to integrate immature neurons, which has important implications for regeneration
and transplantation efforts for neural repair following injury or diseases. Despite considerable progress in
understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis, there are still critical
outstanding questions in the field that have not been addressed due to the technical limitations of traditional
experimental approaches. In the proposed series of studies, we will use several cutting-edge techniques that
we have developed or adapted to investigate the developmental origin of adult neurogenesis, its functional
impact in the adult brain, and the fidelity of rodent models to human neuronal development. First, we will
characterize the origin and properties of embryonic neural precursor cells that give rise to the largely quiescent
pool of neural stem cells that maintain neurogenesis throughout life in a rodent model. Building on our recent
findings that Hopx-expressing neural progenitors in the embryonic dentate gyrus can generate the constitutive
populations in the dentate gyrus before adopting a quiescent state indicative of adult neural stem cells, we will
identify the molecular mechanisms regulate this precursor population and its transition into quiescence. These
studies will provide novel insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling cues that establish a long-term pool of
stem cells in the developing and adult brain. Second, we have developed a 3D organoid model of dentate
gyrus development using human induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate the properties of neural
progenitors, neurogenesis and fate specification. These studies could lead to the potential identification of
human-specific markers of neural stem cells and new granule neurons in the dentate gyrus and mechanistic
differences and similarities with rodent models, which would inform the current debate over the extent of
postnatal neurogenesis in the human dentate gyrus. Third, we will investigate the functional properties of adult
neurogenesis in adult behaving mice using an optogenetic strategy to identify and record electrophysiological
activity of single newborn granule cells at different stages of maturation. We will also investigate the circuit-
level impact of silencing these cells at the population level. These data would provide novel information to
evaluate the hypothesis that adult-born granule cells make a unique contribution to information processing in
the hippocampus using techniques with high temporal resolution. Together, these studies combine an array of
approaches to answer fundamental questions about the origin, impact, and plasticity of neural stem cells and
their progeny in the dentate gyrus using both rodent and human models."
10833665,"Regulated trophoblast migration is indispensable for normal placentation. Shallow trophoblast invasion results
in pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm delivery.
Invasive trophoblasts, called spiral artery-trophoblast giant cells (SpA-TGCs), maintain connectivity and exhibit
an epithelial to endothelial-like transformation when replacing maternal endothelial cells. The mechanism that
directs collective and directional cell movement in SpA-TGCs remains unknown. The proposed project aims to
study how planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in cooperation with cannabinoid signaling regulates organized
trophoblast migration for placentation. Studies are aimed to reveal the impact of disrupted protein complex of
cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and VANGL2, a core component of PCP, signaling in placentation, and
downstream signaling pathways regulating trophoblast migration. In addition, the results will show the advantage
of collective SpA-TGC migration and identify signaling pathways critical for migration. Understanding the
molecular basis of SpA-TGC migration may provide a new strategy to treat preeclampsia. We propose that
PCP and CB1 signaling suppresses random cell protrusions to direct collective trophoblast migration in
placentation. Our specific aims are to test the hypotheses: (1) that PCP signaling is critical for SpA-TGC
migration, and (2) that CB1 and PCP signaling converges to regulate organized migration of TS cell
movement via Rac1. Our preliminary results show that the deletion of Vangl2 or Cnr1 (encoding CB1)
compromises trophoblast stem (TS) cell migration in vitro. To study the role of VANGL2 and CB1 in trophoblast
invasion in vivo, we propose to create mouse models with conditional deletion of Vangl2 and Cnr1 in SpA-TGCs
using a Tpbpa-Cre driver (Vangl2f/fTpbpacre/+ mice), and examine trophoblast differentiation, migration, maternal
endothelial cells replacement and pregnancy outcomes in these mice. We expect that SpA-TGCs missing Vangl2
or Cnr1 have compromised trophoblast migration and placentation. Using Cnr1 or Vangl2 deleted TS cells and
mouse models, we will test if CB1 modulates PCP signaling via functional association with VANGL2. We will test
the effects of CB1 agonists and antagonists on TS cell migration in WT, Cnr1-/- and Vangl2-/- TS cells in vitro,
and WT and Vangl2f/fTpbpacre/+ mice in vivo. These studies will be followed by how CB1/VANGL2 protein complex
suppresses random cell protrusion by inhibiting Rac1 GTPase to order directional cell migration. The results of
the proposed research will unravel novel regulatory pathways in the directional migration of SpA-TGCs during
placentation. The formation of a CB1/VANGL2 protein complex will uncover a new molecular function of
cannabinoid and PCP signaling in placentation. The results will also be of great interest to investigators in
neuroscience, as these signaling pathways are active in the brain functions. The findings may help support public
policy initiatives for the nation's overall health from cannabis consumption."

The laboratory has identified a novel type of ependymal cell (E2) that has two long cilia anchored by two basal

strategic locations of the ventricular system, next to Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) in the walls of the lateral
ventricle and in regions of the third and fourth ventricle critical to feeding and glucose regulation, circadian
rhythms, consciousness, alertness and sleep (Mirzadeh et al. 2017). Interestingly, E2-like cells have been also
observed in ependymomas, suggesting a link to proliferating progenitors and cancer (Alfaro-Cervelló et al.
2015; Ho, Caccamo, and Garcia 1994). E2 cells' genetic profile, the composition and organization of their
unique cilia and basal bodies, their developmental origin, their regenerative capacity, and their function are not
known. Ependymal (E) cells remain one of the least understood glial cell types in the brain, yet these cells are
involved in functions that are essential for proper brain function. Multiciliated ependymal (E1) cells, through the
coordinated beating of their ~50 motile cilia, contribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and are required to
prevent hydrocephalus (Jiménez et al. 2014; Ohata and Alvarez-Buylla 2016; Banizs et al. 2005). In the lateral
ventricles, E cells contribute to the regulation of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) and neuronal migration in the
largest germinal zone of the adult brain: the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). How E cells sense and
transmit CSF signals to this germinal niche remains unknown. It is unlikely that E2 cells through their two cilia
contribute significantly to CSF flow. Instead, we propose that E2 cilia and basal body could play a key role in
the detection of CSF signals. Their location at the interface between the CSF and important brain regions
strongly suggests they have pivotal, as-yet unidentified, roles in brain function. Surprisingly, preliminary data
indicate that the lateral ventricle E2 cells are relatively short-lived, decrease in number with age, and are
constantly regenerated in adult mice. We propose to: 1) characterize E2 cells and their cilia and basal bodies
using single cell gene expression analysis, electron and ultra-high resolution microscopy; 2) determine the
development and adult population dynamics of E2 cells, and identify the progenitor cells giving rise to new E2
cells in the adult (preliminary evidence suggests that E2 cells are derived from adult NSCs); and 3) investigate
whether E2 cell cilia signaling modulates adult stem cell niche function, using conditional deletion of a key cilia
signaling molecule enriched in E2 cells. This new knowledge will be essential to decipher the function of E2
cells in the adult V-SVZ. In addition, molecular markers and signaling pathways identified in E2 cells could help
understand the cell of origin and growth control of some ependymomas. Given the presence of E2 cells in the
third and fourth ventricles, and central canal, next to regions of great functional importance, this new
understanding will also help studies of E cell function throughout the brain."

 Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of in utero exposure to alcohol in breast cancer etiology
and develop preventative strategies. The objective of this project is to investigate the mechanisms of in utero
exposure to alcohol-induced mammary tumor development with a focus on stem cell deregulation.
 Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy has a profound impact on fetal development and disease risk later in
life. Increasing evidence indicates that in utero exposure to certain environmental factors is associated with
amplified breast cancer risk. Previous studies also suggest a link between in utero exposure to alcohol (IUE
alcohol) and increased mammary tumors based on carcinogen-induced models. The underlying mechanisms,
however, remain unclear. We will study the effects of IUE alcohol on mammary tumor risk using the MMTV-
erbB2 transgenic mouse model. Our preliminary data demonstrated that IUE alcohol induces significant pro-
estrogenic changes in mammary development and increased tumor multiplicity in this model system. Microarray
analysis showed that IUE alcohol induces distinctive gene expression associated with receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling pathways in the premalignant mammary tissues. We also found that terminal end bud numbers and
estrogen receptor (ER) and erbB2 pathway signaling were modified in the mammary glands in response to IUE
alcohol. Upon examining the effects of IUE alcohol on mammary epithelial cell differentiation, we found that IUE
alcohol induced the expansion of the basal/myoepithelial and luminal subpopulations in pubertal mammary
glands. To advance our understanding of IUE alcohol-associated breast cancer risk, we propose to investigate
the mechanisms of IUE alcohol-induced deregulation of mammary stem cells (MaSCs)/tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) and crosstalk between ER and erbB2 pathways in mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB2
transgenic mice. Supported by our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that IUE alcohol promotes mammary
tumor risk through the upregulation of ER-erbB2 crosstalk and the consequent deregulation of
MaSCs/progenitor cells, which leads to cancer stem cell/TIC expansion and tumor development. The specific
aims are: 1) To determine the effects of IUE alcohol on MaSC and TIC expansion and function in mammary
tissues and tumors from MMTV-erbB2 mice and 2) To investigate the role of IUE alcohol-induced ER and Sox2
upregulation in the deregulation of MaSCs and TICs in mammary tissues from erbB2 mice. With this clinically
relevant mouse model, significant health concern, and novel approaches, the results from this project are
expected to have a profound impact on breast cancer etiology and prevention."
10834229,"Project Summary
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine fatal inherited neurodegenerative
diseases caused by expansion of an inframe CAG trinucleotide repeat. Each repeat tract
encodes a stretch of glutamine residues in the affected protein, in the case of SCA1 the
protein is ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Symptoms of SCA1 include loss of motor coordination and
balance, slurred speech, swallowing difficulty, spasticity, and some cognitive impairment.
A characteristic feature of SCA1 pathology is atrophy and eventual loss of Purkinje cells
from the cerebellar cortex. Like many neurodegenerative disorders, SCA1 is typically a
late onset disease suggesting that physiological changes due to aging contribute to the
onset of the disease. There is currently no effective treatment. Identifying signaling
pathways and cellular mediators of SCA1 pathogenesis in the cerebellum leading to
ataxia and in the brainstem that underlie lethality are critical in the search for
therapeutics and are the focus of the research outlined in this application for continued
support."
10834934,"Title: Role of PP2A in podocyte biology and diabetic kidney disease
SUMMARY
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains a leading cause of chronic kidney disease with limited treatment options.
Arctigenin (ATG) is a major component derived from the extracts of Fructus Arctii, a traditional Chinese herbal
remedy that has shown to confer renoprotection and to reduce proteinuria in patients with DKD. Our preliminary
data show that ATG administration alone is sufficient to attenuate proteinuria and podocyte injury in mouse
models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Transcriptomic analysis of isolated glomeruli from the diabetic and control
mice showed that the major pathways affected by ATG treatment were of cell adhesion and inflammation. ATG
improved cell adhesion and inhibited migration in cultured human podocytes. By combining the Drug Affinity
Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) technique with Mass Spectrometry analysis we identified protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a top ATG-bound protein in cultured renal cells, and this was further confirmed by
western blot, computational docking, and surface plasmon resonance assay. In addition, ATG enhanced the
activity of PP2A in cultured podocytes and in diabetic glomeruli, resulting in dephosphorylation of p65 NF-κB.
Studying the PP2A interacting proteins in podocytes by Mass Spectrometry identified Drebrin-1 (DBN1) as a F-
actin interacting protein. Dephosphorylation of DBN1 at T335 by PP2A in podocytes resulted in increased cell
adhesion and decreased migration. Importantly, podocyte-specific deletion of Pp2a in mice led to aggravated
diabetes-induced podocyte and glomerular injury and the loss of efficacy in ATG-mediated renoprotection. In
addition, we found that PPP2R2B, a regulatory subunit of PP2A, expresses uniquely in podocytes in human
glomeruli. Its expression is downregulated in the glomeruli of human DKD. In human podocytes, the knockdown
of PPP2R2B reduced PP2A activity and expression of PPP2R2B is suppressed by high glucose. Phenome Wide
Association Scan identified several missense variants in the human PPP2R2B gene which were associated with
either worse or better renal outcomes. These data support a critical role of PP2A in human kidney disease.
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PP2A plays a key role in podocyte biology and pathogenesis
of DKD. To test our hypothesis, we will determine the regulation and function of PPP2R2B in podocyte. We will
also study the role of PPP2R2B in the regulation of PP2A activity, subcellular localization, and podocyte function
in vitro under diabetic conditions and determine whether induction of PPP2R2B or its diseased variant expression
in podocytes affects podocyte injury and DKD progression in diabetic mice. We will also determine the
downstream signaling of PP2A in podocytes by focusing on the role of DBN1. We will study how PP2A affects
podocyte function through regulating DBN1 phosphorylation. The role of DBN1 and its phosphorylation will be
also studied in diabetic mice with DKD using transgenic approach. These studies will help us to reveal new
insights in the podocyte biology and the pathogenesis of DKD and identify potential new therapy for DKD."
10834935,"Abstract. Support is requested for the renewal of an integrated, multidisciplinary training program for
pre-doctoral trainees in genomics, with the goal of providing future scientists with the quantitative and
computational tools necessary for successful biological research. The genome-training program
supports students in Princeton University’s Graduate Program in Quantitative and Computational
Biology (QCB) and other partner departments, including Molecular Biology, Computer Science,
Chemistry, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Physics, and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and is
administered by the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics. Genomics trainees are able to do
their lab rotations and thesis research with any of 24 affiliated faculty in seven departments united by
common interests in quantitative and computational biology, across a wide range of research areas.
We request 10 pre-doctoral positions (our current level) each year during the proposed grant period;
trainees typically are appointed to the training grant for a total of two years. Trainees do experimental
and computational research in: experimental functional genomics in a variety of model and mammalian
systems; computational projects ranging from large-scale genomics data integration, analysis, and
visualization to human origins and evolution; single-cell genomics and other genomics technology
development; and systems biology projects ranging from microbial metabolism to the biophysics of
transcriptional regulation. Trainees have individualized, efficient training plans, which span on average
4.9 years, for those who received their Ph.D. in the last ten years. Formal training includes courses in
genomics and genomic analysis, a seminar series, a journal club / presentation course, responsible
conduct in research training appropriate for both experimental and computational research, and other
multidisciplinary activities centered in the Institute. Trainees have the opportunity to teach in an
innovative multidisciplinary introductory program for undergraduates at Princeton. Finally, trainees and
eligible faculty participate in a number of activities designed to recruit and teach individuals who are
members of under-represented minority groups."
10834937,"Background: Veterans’ suicide risk is highest during the first year after military service separation. This
heightened suicide risk has been associated with difficulties reintegrating into civilian life. Deficiencies in role
functioning (knowing who you are and where you are heading in life) is one of the most commonly reported
challenges during reintegration. Role functioning is critical for optimal functioning in adult life roles (e.g.,
employment) and it is predictive of suicidal ideation and attempts. However, there are no evidence-based
interventions that address role functioning to reduce suicide risk and improve functioning in adult life roles.
Significance: The importance of reaching Veterans proximal to service separation outside of traditional clinic
settings is clear; Veterans’ risk for suicide is highest within the first year of service separation and Veterans are
not well-connected to VA care or other services during this time period. Health coaching is a non-clinical health
behavior change modality that is designed to improve role functioning and can be delivered virtually (via
telephone/video). Although health coaching has been embraced by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),
no rigorous, fully powered trials have examined the effectiveness of health coaching. Virtually-delivered health
coaching may be an easily scalable, low-cost approach to reach reintegrating Veterans outside of clinic
settings to reduce suicide risk and improve functioning in adult life roles.
Innovation: No studies have examined the use of health coaching among reintegrating Veterans outside of the
clinic setting. This study’s strategic use of virtually-delivered health coaching builds on VHA’s investment in this
non-clinical modality that has the potential to reduce suicide risk during a high-risk transition period.
Specific Aims: This pilot study will 1) Examine the feasibility of study procedures and acceptability of the
health coaching intervention among reintegrating Veterans; 2) Evaluate measures of mediators and outcomes
for suitability in a future confirmatory efficacy trial; and 3) Determine barriers and facilitators of implementation
of health coaching among reintegrating Veterans.
Methodology: We will enroll a national sample of 94 Veterans within three months of military service
separation and follow them for 9 months, capturing their first year of separation. Participants will be
randomized to health coaching + enhanced usual care (EUC) or EUC only. The intervention group will receive
up to 12 health coaching sessions over the phone or via video (per participant preference). All participants will
receive a booklet about VA benefits and services, organized by functional domains, as an enhancement to
“usual care.” Participants will complete self-report assessments at baseline, mid-intervention (month 2), post-
intervention (month 4), and follow-up (month 9). Approximately 30 participants will complete qualitative
interviews on their experiences with health coaching and intervention coaches will complete exit interviews on
their experiences delivering coaching. VHA administrative data will be used to ascertain VHA care utilization.
We will use study log data, a satisfaction measure, and qualitative interviews to examine feasibility of the study
methods and acceptability of the intervention, including potential harms. Evaluation of measures for inclusion in
a future efficacy trial will involve characterizing typical variation, descriptive analyses of within-person change
across time, and adjusted estimates of treatment effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals. To inform barriers
and facilitators to implementing virtually-delivered health coaching we will analyze Veteran qualitative
interviews and coach exit interviews using a primarily descriptive thematic analysis approach.
Next steps: Data gathered in this study will inform design of a subsequent efficacy trial of virtually-delivered
health coaching among reintegrating Veterans and future implementation strategies. This line of research will
inform the strategic use of virtually-delivered health coaching as a population-based rehabilitation approach to
reduce suicide risk and improve functioning in life roles among reintegrating Veterans."
10834938,"Over one hundred thousand Veterans annually utilize mental health residential rehabilitation programs
(RRTPs) and psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery centers (PRRCs). Through support and comprehensive
programming, these mental health rehabilitation milieus help Veterans with mental illness overcome barriers to
community reintegration. Despite the success of these milieus, cognitive impairment is commonly observed in
Veterans with mental illness, reduces gains from programming, and limits successful recovery. Cognitive
impairment is a common transdiagnostic illness dimension conferred both directly and indirectly by mental
illnesses. Cognitive rehabilitation through remediation strategies can potentially attenuate cognitive impairment
for these Veterans and improve outcomes, but there are two inter-related problems that limit the effectiveness
of such interventions. First, we are not able to identify which Veterans will benefit from mental health
rehabilitation programming at program entry. Second, we are not able to predict which Veterans are going to
benefit from any specific cognitive remediation intervention.
This CDA-2 application seeks to test whether an electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarker, mismatch
negativity (MMN), can be used to predict Veteran recovery in mental health rehabilitation treatment settings,
and identify Veterans who will respond to cognitive remediation interventions. MMN is an event-related
potential which is considered to be a biomarker of information processing, linked to cognition in healthy
subjects and cognitive impairment in a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses. MMN also mediates psychosocial
and functional outcomes in individuals without any psychiatric comorbidities and individuals with mental illness.
Recent work also suggests that MMN can identify individuals who will experience gains from a full course of
cognitive remediation when measured over the first hour of cognitive remediation. These biomarker
relationships (cognition, cognitive remediation sensitivity, functioning) have not yet been definitively established
in a heterogenous Veteran population receiving care in real-world settings like RRTPs and PRRCs.
Veterans with mental illness will be recruited from the VA San Diego Healthcare system RRTP and PRRC at
program entry. Baseline measures of functioning, psychosocial disability, cognition and treatment engagement
will be collected. Following these assessments, Veterans will undergo testing to collect MMN data, and then
will be challenged with a one-hour cognitive remediation exercise, which is a typical component of full multi-
hour cognitive remediation programs. Veterans will be followed with monthly assessments of psychosocial
disability and treatment engagement. At the end of study, functioning will also be re-assessed.
If successful, results from the studies proposed will create an objective, precision-medicine platform which
could fundamentally change how RRTP and PRRC approach rehabilitative programming for Veterans with
mental illness. In carrying out the studies proposed, the PI will gain critical training in advanced EEG biomarker
analyses, computational/statistical methodology and clinical trial design and implementation which will expand
his scientific skill set and lead to scientific independence. This CDA-2 will allow the PI to work towards his
career goal of using EEG biomarkers to personalize cognitive rehabilitation interventions for Veterans with
mental illness."
10835059,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Community gun violence kills more than 15,000 people each year who are disproportionately younger, Black
men. In addition, people living in communities with high rates of gun violence experience long-term negative
physical and mental health effects from persistent trauma. At the root of neighborhood conditions that allow
this violence and trauma to persist are generations of structural racism, including redlining policies and mass
incarceration, which contribute to systemic disinvestment in these neighborhoods and disruption of community
bonds. This proposal challenges long-standing structurally racist policies that limit resources and addresses
the social context that stymies positive relationships by permitting and normalizing trauma after exposure to
gun violence by applying a counteracting positive, systemic community-level approach to change the
context within which intergenerational cycles of gun violence, trauma, and incarceration persist. Dr. Brita Roy,
MD, MPH, MHS, Director of Population Health at Yale Medicine and core faculty at the Yale Center for
Research Engagement, and Virginia Spell, CEO of Urban League of Southern Connecticut, a civil rights
organization, have partnered with stakeholders across New Haven, Connecticut, to design and test a program
to reduce gun violence by addressing structural racism. TRUE HAVEN: TRUsted rEsidents and Housing
Assistance to decrease Violence Exposure in New Haven is a multi-level, multi-component, assets-based
intervention to increase the stability, wealth, and well-being of neighborhoods affected by gun violence by: (1)
setting up a citywide community stakeholder-led governance structure to oversee the program and identify and
address racist policies, (2) increasing housing stability by enrolling 400 families affected by incarceration each
year in a program that couples comprehensive financial education with rental assistance or down-payment and
loan assistance, and (3) providing greater support for mental health and well-being by training trusted
community members (e.g., barbers, educators, faith leaders, youth mentors) in trauma-informed counseling
techniques to recognize and support those affected by the trauma of gun violence. We will target
implementation of this intervention package to individuals and families affected by incarceration residing within
six New Haven neighborhoods with high rates of gun violence. We will perform a hybrid type 1
effectiveness/implementation study to assess the effects of TRUE HAVEN on neighborhood rates of incident
gun violence using a stepped wedge study design and identify organizational and policy factors that act as key
barriers and facilitators to TRUE HAVEN implementation. We will also track the number and types of racist
policies addressed and project their community-wide impact using a simulation model that can be adapted by
other communities aiming to tackle structural racism. This study will yield a roadmap for how cities can
effectively and systematically tackle structural racism to reduce gun violence and improve community health
and well-being."
10835060,"This career development award will provide me with an opportunity to develop the needed skills to become an
independent investigator using advanced machine learning and large-scale clinical cohorts applied to epilepsy.
The research project centers on forecasting the risk of seizures non-invasively using electronic diaries (e-diaries)
and biosensor data. It is unknown if non-invasive seizure forecasting can be sufficiently accurate to have clinical
utility. My prior retrospective work suggests that using advanced machine learning algorithms to evaluate e-diary
data (i.e., internal factors), forecasts of seizure risk are more accurate than chance forecasts. It is unknown if
enhancing these forecasts using additional data from sleep biosensors, medication adherence, stress, weather
patterns, stress, and exercise (i.e., external factors) would improve the accuracy further. Preliminary data
suggest that this additional data may be valuable. For Aim 1, this project will prospectively validate the machine
learning algorithm to forecast seizure risk in a cohort of people with epilepsy using e-diaries alone (internal
factors). The forecasts will be compared with a rate-matched random forecast as a baseline. For Aim 2, the
forecasts will be enriched using data from a wearable biosensor, automated medication adherence, as well as
information about stress, hormonal cycles and weather (external factors). The expected outcome of this study is
a validated method with higher accuracy for forecasting seizure risk using non-invasive techniques. In addition,
this project includes educational objectives through mentorship and online courses and local coursework
designed to prepare for research independence. The main educational objectives are (1) developing skills in
advanced data science techniques, (2) managing a large clinical cohort, (3) build a strong
biostatistics/informatics foundation, and (4) professional development. Dr. Brandon Westover, one of the
foremost data science experts in the field of epilepsy, will serve as the primary mentor for this project. Additional
mentorship will come from Dr. Jimeng Sun, an expert in machine learning and computer science, as well as Dr.
Thomas Travison, an expert biostatistician and clinical trialist. My goal is to establish a state-of-the-art,
independent laboratory focused on data science applied to decrease morbidity and mortality from epilepsy."

 This proposal seeks funding to examine the impact of a 12.5-year long, relationship-based, professional
mentoring program, Friends of the Children (FOTC) within the context of an existing multi-site randomized
controlled trial (RCT; FOTC versus control). The research trial (The Child Study) was funded by the NIH
through the NICHD from 2007-2013. The program has continued through a variety of external funders.
Professional mentors (called “Friends”) have continued working with the youth since the project began.
Mentors receive extensive training and apprenticeship, and then participate in ongoing supervision, working
with a typical caseload of 8 children during elementary school and 10-12 youth during middle and high school.
Across the course of the program, youth involved in the program have interacted both with their mentors and
with other youth-mentor pairs, becoming part of a community of children and adolescents and caring adults.
 To the best of our knowledge, there are no published, rigorous outcome studies of a mentoring program
that has this combination of program elements. The study is built on the rigorous research program that began
during The Child Study (Eddy, et al. 2015, Eddy et al., 2017), which demonstrated the strong adoption and
implementation of the FOTC mentoring model. Further, 5 years after the program began, this study found
growth in parent’s report of the youth’s behavioral strengths, as measured by increased family involvement,
interpersonal strengths and school functioning; positive school behavior; and less externalizing problem
behavior in youth randomized to FOTC compared to controls. The proposed study will reengage participants in
both intervention and control conditions to conduct end-line (just after actual or estimated high school
graduation) and 2-year follow-up evaluations of program impact into young adulthood.
 The study uses a rigorous RCT design that includes two assessments of all of the active participants in
The Child Study (N = 259), a sample of low income, ethnically diverse, at-risk, urban youth. Data will also be
collected from caregivers and school, arrest and court records will be collected at the end point.
Implementation data collected by FOTC will also be used in the analysis. Young adult surveys will be
conducted and arrest and court records collection at the 2-year follow-up (about age 21). Using intent-to-treat
analyses, this study will examine program impacts in 3 primary outcomes -- avoidance of involvement in
juvenile justice, graduation from high school or obtaining a GED, and delaying parenthood into young
adulthood, at the program end point and 2 years later. Further, we will explore whether hypothesized
mechanisms of increased social capital mediates the relationships between intervention and outcomes. Finally,
we will examine the relationship between various levels of program involvement in FOTC and program impact."
10837449,"ABSTRACT
Metastasis contributes to the vast majority of breast cancer deaths but current therapies for disseminated
disease have limited efficacy and significant side effects. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has
outstanding promise for breast cancer in late stages but is currently only approved for triple-negative cancers
(TNBC) that stain positive for PD-L1 protein; of these patients, only ~25% show an initial response. Although
the cause of divergent response is multifactorial, it is believed that “re-educating” immunosuppressive immune
populations within tumors will increase the response rate. However, approaches to modulate cells are primarily
based on systemically administered immunostimulatory drugs which have severe side effects.
This project will develop a targeted therapy that delivers immunostimulatory drugs to immunosuppressive
macrophages in metastatic breast tumors while minimizing effects in off-target tissues. With most
macromolecular delivery strategies, the vast majority of an intravenously administered dose accumulates in the
liver and spleen. We discovered that for certain nanocarriers, liver and spleen uptake can be blocked with
adjuvants so that the nanocarriers accumulate in macrophages of orthotopic TNBC tumors in mouse models.
We determined that this strategy could be used to deliver a compound that reduced tumor burden in
combination with ICB therapy. The free drug alone is potently immune-stimulating but is too toxic for systemic
treatment in humans. Remarkably, the nanocarrier and blocker combination reduces serum cytokine release
37-fold relative to the free drug. The nanocarriers and blockers are composed of highly biocompatible materials
that are in routine clinical use.
This project will optimize the composition of these agents for biodegradation and elimination to maximize the
potential for clinical translation and further optimize the dosing and scheduling for delivery in combination with
ICB therapy. At the conclusion of this project, we will have designed an optimal approach to deliver immune
modulators selectively to metastatic cancerous tissue, and macrophages within that tissue, to maximize
efficacy while minimizing side effects. This strategy has the potential to revolutionize cancer therapy, similar to
how nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) has improved breast cancer outcomes through targeted therapy."

The research strategy and training plan included in this F99/K00 proposal will enhance the career development
and research independence of Caitlin G. Allen, MPH. This research plan aims to advance knowledge of how to
expand the reach and uptake of existing evidence-based genetics tools such as family cancer history (FCH)
among underserved minority populations. FCH collection is a simple, proven way to identify individual's genetic
risk for developing cancer that can encourage tailored cancer prevention and risk-stratified screening. Despite
national efforts, FCH collection remains suboptimal with especially noteworthy disparities in collection among
African American (AA) families. Ms. Allen's F99 research and training will focus on developing her skills in social
network analysis to study individual and family network factors that contribute to poor knowledge of FCH. Ms.
Allen has already completed two complementary dissertation studies that directly inform the proposed F99
research: 1) a systematic review of family health collection tools, and 2) development of a valid and reliable scale
used to identify family network members that are highly likely to share FCH information. She will complete her
dissertation research in the F99 phase of this award, which will involve: 1) 50 AA participants completing their
FCH using a FCH collection tool (ItRunsInMyFamily), and 2) characterizing individual- and network-level factors
that influence FCH collection by conducting personal network interviews using the Colored Eco-Genetic
Relationship Map technique. To accomplish these aims, her F99 training objectives are to: 1) hone professional
skills in grantsmanship, academic writing, and research dissemination, 2) develop scientific independence by
strengthening methodological and analytic skills in social network analysis and relevant research methods, and
3) identify a postdoctoral site and K00 mentor. Ms. Allen's F99 training plan is bolstered by strong support from
an excellent mentorship team at the Rollins School of Public Health and the research infrastructure at Emory
University, creating an optimal training environment. Ms. Allen's postdoctoral research (K00 phase) will expand
upon F99 work by enhancing a FCH collection tool (ItRunsInMyFamily) through human centered design
approaches and implementing this tool in community-based clinical settings. Her training goals aligned with this
phase of research includes: 1) building knowledge in human centered design and health technology assessment,
2) becoming an expert in implementation science, and 3) enhancing professional and research skills to prepare
for an academic research position. Collectively, the integrated research plan and training goals are critical to
establishing a successful, innovative, and meaningful academic career focused on extending cancer-specific
genetics discoveries to marginalized and underrepresented populations by supporting evidence-based solutions
such as FCH to improve cancer prevention and early-detection."
10928275,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy, a condition that impacts over 30 million Americans.
Often, this condition occurs as painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN), which is particularly challenging
to treat in the clinic, in part due to the lack of effective treatments and the risk of dependency for opioid analgesics.
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a treatment that stimulates nerve electrical activity in the spine, and is proven
to be effective for pain conditions, including PDPN, for which SCS is now FDA approved through multiple device
manufacturers. However, the mechanisms by which SCS improves pain are not yet known, and may involve
promoting neural plasticity and small fiber nerve regeneration. We hypothesize that the electrical activity in
stimulated spinal nerves with SCS treatment improves pain due to, or in parallel to, improvements in peripheral
tissue innervation. This is based on decades of research evidence that electrical stimulation can promote nerve
plasticity and regeneration. We will compare 3 PDPN treatment groups (N=15 each) across an 18mo longitudinal
study: conventional medical management (CMM), SCS treatment, or SCS with a delayed activation of the device
at 3mo post-surgery (to control for placebo effect of the surgery or device implantation). A team comprised of
neuroscientists, neurologists, a neuromodulation surgeon, and computational/biostatistical experts will collect an
8-point dataset across this study timeline, in order to rigorously compare pain improvement scores with small
and large fiber neuropathy assessments, quality of life scores, and metabolic parameters. The innovation of this
study is further driven by the inclusion of a new functional measure of small fiber nerve electrical activity, using
the Detecting Early Neuropathy (DEN) device, which employs a microneedle array to collect data on nerve
activity up to 4mm deep from the skin surface. This is the first device capable of measuring small nerve fiber
activity as a diagnostic test for small fiber peripheral neuropathy, such as diabetic neuropathy. Taken together,
this study will provide important new data on PDPN improvements with SCS treatment and whether mechanisms
include changes to small fiber tissue innervation or nerve activity."

 The broad goal of the proposed research is to develop highly enabling and rapid
chemical technologies for the synthesis of life-altering drug compounds. Our focus is in
the area of C–H functionalization, a synthetic strategy that is well-established to expedite
the discovery of bioactive small molecules. Since its conception, the majority of Csp3–H
functionalization methods rely on open-shell mechanistic pathways via alkyl radicals or
metal alkyl intermediates. To continue the advancement of C–H modification technologies,
there is a critical need for new mechanistic designs. We hypothesize that polar (two-
electron) mechanisms can be accessed in a C–H functionalization context to offer
orthogonal reactivity to the current state-of-the-art methods. To this end, our central
hypothesis is to design reaction platforms that can access carbocation intermediates
directly from a Csp3–H bond. The design will bypass the need for pre-installed functional
groups that are usually required to generate carbocations, thus streamlining the direct
modification of late-stage drug leads and resulting in the rapid synthesis of compound
libraries for high-throughput drug development. The innovative approach to convert
Csp3–H bonds into highly reactive carbocations is via a stepwise dismantling process: first
hydrogen atom abstraction at the desired bond followed by a radical-polar crossover, or
oxidation of a carbon radical to its cationic equivalent. With the design of the mechanism
executed with a photocatalytic platform, we envision the reaction to be mild and capable
of engaging a broad scope. The five-year goal is to utilize the proposed strategy to target
benzylic, aliphatic and a-halo C–H bonds and utilize the resulting carbocations to facilitate
high value bond formations with abundant nucleophilic partners. The proposal is
significant in that we will be investigating an underexplored reaction space that is ripe
with new synthetic opportunities that have the potential to offer modularity in approach,
simplicity of reagents, and complexity of products."

groups that are usually required to generate carbocations, thus streamlining the direct
modification of late-stage drug leads and resulting in the rapid synthesis of compound
libraries for high-throughput drug development. The innovative approach to convert
Csp3–H bonds into highly reactive carbocations is via a stepwise dismantling process: first
hydrogen atom abstraction at the desired bond followed by a radical-polar crossover, or
oxidation of a carbon radical to its cationic equivalent. With the design of the mechanism
executed with a photocatalytic platform, we envision the reaction to be mild and capable
of engaging a broad scope. The five-year goal is to utilize the proposed strategy to target
benzylic, aliphatic and a-halo C–H bonds and utilize the resulting carbocations to facilitate
high value bond formations with abundant nucleophilic partners. The proposal is
significant in that we will be investigating an underexplored reaction space that is ripe
with new synthetic opportunities that have the potential to offer modularity in approach,
simplicity of reagents, and complexity of products."

Gut dysfunction, dysbiosis, and residual inflammation are major factors contributing to the high prevalence of
comorbidities such as metabolic, cardiovascular, kidney, and liver diseases in people living with HIV under
antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the immune mechanisms underlying the process of gut dysfunction and
persistent inflammation in the setting of long-term viral suppression with ART remain poorly understood. We
have recently reported in the nonhuman primate model of HIV with ART that following initial resolution of
circulating leaky gut biomarkers during early ART, dysregulation of IL-17/IL-22 functions of intestinal Gamma
delta (γδ) T cells are correlated with resurgence of intestinal epithelial barrier damage (IEBD) and systemic
inflammation during long-term ART. Further, intestinal Vδ2T cell frequencies significantly correlated with the loss
of specific gut microbial species during long-term ART. Based on this, we propose to test the hypothesis that
specific dysregulation of the IL-17/IL-22 pathway in γδT cells, particularly the Vδ2 subset, contributes to
breakdown of the gut epithelial barrier, resulting in microbial translocation (MT) and systemic inflammation during
chronic treated HIV infection. Here, we propose to assess the role of Vδ2 γδT cells in the repair and maintenance
of gut homeostasis through a direct in vivo intervention. We will evaluate the effect of in vivo Vδ2T-stimulation
and expansion on IEBD, MT, and inflammation in long-term ART suppressed SIV-infection via treatment with
the aminobisphosphonate drug, Zoledronate (ZOL) in combination with IL-2 and IL-15 cytokines. Second, we
propose to test the hypothesis that modulation of gut microbiome during chronic SIV+ART with microbial
supplementation combined with in vivo Vδ2T cell stimulation will have a synergistic effect on improving gut barrier
functions. We will administer fecal microbial transplant (FMT) supplemented with anti-inflammatory bacterial
species, with/without ZOL treatment to assess normalization of systemic inflammatory markers and gut immune
functions in FMT-only vs. FMT with immunomodulation. Finally, we will determine the mechanisms by which γδT
cells and microbiome modulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis during long-term treated SIV infection. We will
longitudinally assess the transcriptional and functional signatures of intestinal IL-17/IL-22 producing cells and
evaluate epithelial barrier functions in precisely timed gut biopsies and in vitro coculture assays to identify novel
cellular/molecular mechanisms involved. By exploring the beneficial effects of combined immune/microbiome
modulation on epithelial barrier-protective function and systemic inflammation, this study will have the critical
impact of opening new avenues for the continued development of combinatorial approaches to target
enteropathy and chronic inflammation in people living with HIV."
10848568,"Summary: The central hypothesis of Project 3 is that the rate of stochastic damage at genome and epigenome
level is a major factor in the control of species-specific life span. Both DNA mutations and epimutations figure
prominently as drivers of aging clocks, i.e., biomarkers of aging, and have been implicated as causal factors in
aging and age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. Project 3 is studying the
rate of stochastic alterations in genome, epigenome, and transcriptome. Recent advances in omics technology,
including our own development of new, single-cell and single-molecule methods, allow the accurate quantitative
detection of de novo somatic mutations in normal cells and tissues, including genome structural variants. In the
previous, still ongoing project period we used one of these methods to show that somatic mutation rate inversely
correlates with species-specific lifespan. We also showed that rate and persistence of mutagen-induced,
stochastic changes in the DNA methylome and transcriptome are higher in cells from short-lived as compared
to long-lived rodents. Using these methods, as well as recently emerged long-read sequencing methods we will
now specifically test the hypothesis that genome structural variation (Aim 1) and DNA methylation changes (Aim
2), induced by g-radiation in primary cells from up to 50 species with great differences in lifespan, are more
severe and occur at a higher rate in short- as compared to long-lived species. We will also test specific
interventions to increase genome maintenance developed in Project 1 for an effect on the maintenance of
genome sequence integrity, new rodent models for Azheimer’s Disease developed in Project 2 for increased
somatic mutation rate in brain, and develop new, genome or epigenome-based molecular clocks with Project 4."
10849926,"SUMMARY
Dendritic cells (DC) are responsible for directing T cell responses and macrophages important for modulating
tissue inflammation. A hallmark of these immune cells is their inherent plasticity to govern immunity vs. tolerance.
However, much remains unknown regarding the complex molecular networks that collectively govern
hematopoiesis, inflammation and antigen presentation. Incomplete understanding presents major obstacles to
delineating their underlying roles in health and disease, which has also hindered success in developing effective
immunotherapies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine how pivotal immunoregulatory
proteins govern DC and macrophage differentiation and immune responses. Published findings by my laboratory
have begun to mechanistically define the functional roles of several important genes uniquely expressed in these
myeloid cells. These genes, which include Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF1) and Phosphodiesterase 1b
(Pde1b), among others, were identified using a combination of high throughput transcriptomic profiling coupled
with rigorous RNAi functional screening. My laboratory demonstrated that AIF1 is selectively expressed in
conventional type 1 DC (cDC1), monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) and macrophages and serves as a scaffold to
recruit protein kinase C (PKC) in a calcium-responsive manner to promote inflammation and type 1 polarized
immune responses. Furthermore, AIF1 expression was required for successful generation of cDC1 from
hematopoietic progenitors and both MoDC and macrophages from monocyte precursors. In the context of
disease, AIF1 expression in DC and macrophages is required for initiating and sustaining insulitis and in
regulating effector responses to intracellular pathogens. In another line of studies, the phosphodiesterase protein
Pde1b was found to depress protein kinase A (PKA) activity in a calcium-dependent manner by regulating
cyclonucleotide levels in cDC1, MoDC and macrophages to promote immune effector responses. Thus, my
research group has begun to unravel how Pde1b works in concert with AIF1 to govern immunity by balancing
PKC vs. PKA activities. As important as these initial findings are, there remains several gaps in understanding
the molecular mechanics of how these genes govern immunobiology. As such, our research builds on prior
studies by now employing conditional and global knockout mice and use of innovative experimental tools to
rigorously study mechanistic roles in vivo. My laboratory will pursue the following major goals over the next five
years: (1) delineate how AIF1 and Pde1B govern differentiation of DC and macrophages in vivo; (2) describe the
intracellular processes by which other key novel immunoregulatory genes orchestrate immune responses; (3)
determine the contributing role of AIF1 in initiating inflammation and sustaining autoreactive T cell responses;
and (4) identify how intracellular pathogens antagonize AIF1 and Pde1b through disruption of calcium signaling
and cyclonucleotide levels to evade host immunity. Knowledge gained will fill key gaps in our understanding of
DC and macrophage biology and provide important insights into the molecular networks governing immunity."

10932371,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sepsis affects >70,000 U.S. children annually with 5-10% mortality, 35% long-term morbidity, and annual
national costs of $7.3 billion. Outcomes are improved by timely diagnosis, which is less likely in general
Emergency Departments (EDs) which treat adults and children. Although up to 80% of children with sepsis are
treated in general EDs, the few studies in these settings have not identified strategies to improve diagnosis.
Sepsis is an exemplar condition for challenges to timely diagnosis, highlighting diagnostic complexities noted in
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s 2015 report Improving Diagnosis in Health
Care. This project also addresses challenges in pediatric emergency preparedness noted in the Institute of
Medicine’s 2007 report, Growing Pains. The long-term goals of this work are to identify strategies to improve
diagnosis of high-risk conditions in EDs. While establishing capacity to improve diagnosis across emergency
conditions, the initial demonstration project will focus on pediatric sepsis, using methods of 1) identification,
analysis, and reduction of diagnostic errors, and 2) work system improvements. It will uniquely leverage the
transfer call center and the brief consultative phone call as an opportunity to apply diagnostic safety strategies
and disseminate pediatric subspecialty knowledge. Phone calls with consultants are frequently used in
diagnostic decision-making in EDs and have rarely been studied; this team will apply conversation analysis to
recorded calls to identify opportunities to improve communication and the diagnostic process. This study will
adapt and implement a diagnostic safety toolkit including: 1) a content-specific sepsis diagnostic checklist with
demonstrated effectiveness in pediatric EDs, 2) improvement in subspecialty consultation processes to follow
diagnostic safety principles. The study will be conducted in a children’s hospital transfer call center that
receives calls about >18,000 children in >100 general EDs yearly. The aims are: SA1: Analyze the current
diagnostic process in children with sepsis referred to the transfer center using mixed methods. Conversation
analysis of recorded phone calls and quantitative analysis will guide evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and the
diagnostic work system and process. SA2: Use the Implementation Mapping Adapt process to adapt diagnostic
strategies (content-specific checklist and work system improvements) for implementation in the transfer center
call process. SA3: Implement and evaluate the sepsis diagnostic safety toolkit in an 18-month implementation
study. This work will establish strategies for improving the diagnosis of time-sensitive pediatric emergencies in
general ED settings, where most children receive their critical first hours of treatment. Children’s hospitals’
transfer call centers are a unique, replicable opportunity to disseminate pediatric knowledge at the moment it is
needed, improving diagnostic safety for children in any ED. Strategies identified in this work focused on
content-specific checklists and work system improvements to the phone consultation process can be replicated
in other conditions, improving diagnosis and safety in emergency medicine."
10830997,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent type of cancer diagnosed each year and CRC patients have
the second highest mortality rate, worldwide. Standard of care treatments for CRC is largely ineffective against
metastatic CRC (mCRC), which has an 11% 5-year overall survival rate. Aberrant T-Cell Factor (TCF)
transcription is a major driver of tumor progression to mCRC. Therapeutic development directly targeting the
inhibition of TCF-transcription of genes associated with mCRC may be an effective therapeutic strategy for
mCRC, and currently no such therapies are clinically approved. Using a cohort of ~600 CRC patient tumor
samples (GEOdataset (GSE40967) and CU AMC GI tissue bank), we have identified an oncogene, known as
CHD1L, to be linked as a driver of mCRC and patient poor prognosis. We have characterized CHD1L to be a
required component of TCF-transcription during malignant gene expression. We hypothesize that CHD1L is a
molecular target that functions as a DNA binding factor for the TCF-transcription complex, and CHD1L is
specifically recruited to activate mesenchymal genes and other genes associated with mCRC. Currently there
are no known inhibitors of CHD1L. Thus, we conducted HTS drug discovery targeting recombinant CHD1L
ATPase to identify the first-in-class inhibitors of CHD1L. In Aim 1 we will validate these CHD1L inhibitors as
lead drugs using a hit-to-lead schema in sequence. In Aim 2 we will conduct drug design and medicinal chemistry
based on a validated lead CHD1L inhibitor pharmacophore. In Aim 3 we will prioritize 15 lead CHD1L inhibitors
for in vivo pharmacology, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy in patient derived
xenografts. This research will lead to a diversity of novel CHD1L inhibitors that can be developed as molecular
probes or potential therapeutics that would be expected to impact our understanding and treatment of mCRC."

A fundamental question in cell biology is how cells build functionally and structurally distinct microtubule (MT)
networks using a seemingly simple set of protein building blocks -- -tubulin heterodimers. For many years,
the cytoskeletal field has focused on the roles of MT-binding proteins and motors as the primary regulators of
network structure and function. However, it is now clear that the -tubulin building blocks are not so simple.
Rather than a uniform track, the MT surface is a molecularly diverse landscape that is generated by genetic
and posttranslational differences between -tubulins. The `tubulin code' model posits that changes to the
intrinsically disordered carboxy-terminal tail (CTT) domains of -tubulins create a molecular code at the MT
surface that is “read” by MT-binding proteins. The overarching goals of this proposal are to establish
mechanistic connections between CTTs and the conformational diversity of MT ends and lattices, and to
understand how this regulates complex MT network functions at the cellular level.

My lab has
established expertise in investigating tubulin using approaches that integrate genetic models, live-cell imaging
and protein biochemistry. Our progress over the past five years has furthered our understanding of how -
tubulin CTTs regulate MT networks, and, more broadly, how tubulin heterogeneity impacts cellular and
developmental processes. The proposed project will build upon our expertise to expand the current model of
the tubulin code and give broader insights into mechanisms of MT function. Our goals for the next five years
include 1) define how CTTs guide the structure of MT ends to regulate MT dynamics, 2) determine how blends
of -tubulins with different amino acid sequences and posttranslational modifications give rise to complex
behaviors at the level of MT networks in cells, 3) define how CTTs promote the directionality of kinesin motility
along MTs, and 4) establish a novel role for tubulins in buffering intracellular cation concentrations. Our
synergistic approach is uniquely suited to advance knowledge of tubulin structure and function that will be
important in a broad range of contexts, provide new insights into how microtubule networks regulate and
respond to changes at the level of tubulin subunits, and how these impact different cellular contexts."
10846679,"The proximal intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (FABPs), FABP1 (aka liver FABP) and FABP2 (aka intestinal FABP) have long been thought to function in dietary lipid transport and processing in the enterocyte. Our previous work at the biophysical, cellular, and animal levels has shown clearly that these two coexpressed proteins, both of which bind long chain FA, have distinct functions. While both are involved in intestinal lipid uptake and assimilation, albeit in different ways, they each appear to also function uniquely in regulating systemic energy homeostasis. In particular, whereas high fat-fed FABP1-/- mice are hyperphagic and become markedly obese, FABP2-/- mice remain lean. Since FABP1 is highly expressed in both intestine and liver, we engineered an intestine-specific FABP1 knockout. We find that the obese phenotype is recapitulated in the FABP1int-/- mouse, underscoring an important role for intestinal FABPs in whole body energy metabolism. Unexpectedly, single cell transcriptomics has revealed that both FABP1 and FABP2 are expressed in enteroendocrine cells (EEC), and indeed we find alterations in plasma GIP and GLP-1 levels in FABP1-/- and FABP2-/- mice. Moreover, we and others have shown that in addition to FA, FABP1 and FABP2 bind endocannabinoids (EC). Preliminary results also identify other bioactive compounds as novel ligands for these proteins. Thus, we will explore the hypothesis that intestinal FABPs, potentially via EECs, bind specific ligands derived from the diet or their metabolites, and thereby function as nutrient sensors to effect downstream modulation of systemic energy balance. We will use multiple approaches--biochemical, physiological, and structure-based in silico methods--to begin to address this hypothesis in these Specific Aims: 1) To define the complete lipidomic binding profiles of FABP1 and FABP2, and determine the effects of known and newly identified ligands on intestinal epithelial cell transcriptomics and hormonal secretion. Studies will use in vitro lipidomic biochemical profiling as well as intestinal organoid cultures from FABP2 null and FABP1int-/- mice incubated with known and newly identified ligands to identify pathways modulated by specific lipid-FABP interactions; 2) To identify the roles of FABP1 and FABP2 in enteroendocrine signaling, and how this may regulate systemic metabolic effects. These studies address the hypothesis that FABP1 and FABP2, acting through binding of EC and/or other lipids, modulate EEC signaling and GIP and GLP-1 release into the blood, affecting body weight gain. Studies will use mice with EEC-specific ablation of FABP1 and FABP2, and isolated EECs from WT and FABP null mice. 3) To determine whether specific FABP1 and FABP2 ligands tailor the protein surface for sensing and signaling. We will analyze protein tertiary structures derived from NMR spectroscopy using known substrates and newly identified ligands. We hypothesize that by interacting with specific ligands, FABPs will display uniquely altered surface properties which promote interactions with different downstream effectors, i.e. ligand-dependent differences in FABP-protein interactions."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major epidemic, and its impact may be particularly severe for women. One
of the most striking examples is “the telescoping effect” wherein women meet criteria for SUD and/or seek
treatment after fewer years of drug use as compared to men. This effect has been reported for multiple drug
classes, including psychostimulants and opioids. Our data obtained from the previous funding period establish
that a similar phenomenon occurs in a rat model of cocaine use disorder (CUD) with females developing an
addiction-like phenotype sooner during abstinence than males. We have defined an addiction-like phenotype as
an enhanced motivation for cocaine. This feature develops over abstinence following extended-access (ExA,
>6-hr/day) but not short-access (ShA) self-administration, and like SUD in humans, it represents a lasting shift
toward a higher motivational state. Our data show that 7 days of abstinence is sufficient for inducing this
phenotype in females, whereas males require 14 days. Females tested after 7 days of abstinence also display
greater compulsive cocaine use, as measured using a punishment procedure, but by 14 days of abstinence,
males reach the female-level. Our goals with this competitive R01 renewal application are to characterize
molecular shifts that underlie the telescoping effect, and to determine whether, similar to humans, the
telescoping effect also occurs with opioids. Our primary hypothesis is that a shift from nucleus accumbens
(NAc) dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) to glutamate AMPA receptors (AMPAR) occurs sooner during abstinence in
females than males and underlies the telescoping effect. This hypothesis is based on our findings showing that
following the development of an addiction-like phenotype, the mechanisms motivating cocaine use shift in both
males and females from NAc D1R to AMPAR, and that in females, estradiol is necessary for the development of
this phenotype and the shift to a diminished role of NAc D1R. In Aim 1, using site-specific antagonism of NAc
D1R and AMPAR, we will determine mechanistic shifts that occur with the development of an enhanced
motivation for cocaine and compulsive cocaine use. Effects will be examined following ExA self-administration
and 1-day of abstinence, which will not induce an addiction-like phenotype or molecular shift in either sex, or 7-
days of abstinence, which will induce this phenotype and molecular shift in females with estradiol, but not males
or females without estradiol. In Aim 2, we will use RNA- and ChIP-sequencing to test the hypothesis that estrogen
receptors regulate the transcriptional events that accompany the development of an addiction-like phenotype.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will use an ExA fentanyl self-administration procedure optimized for studying sex differences
to test the hypothesis that, similar to humans, female rats develop an opioid addiction-like phenotype sooner
during abstinence than males. These studies will provide entirely novel information of the mechanism underlying
the telescoping effect and identify possible targets to prevent its occurrence in women. They will also establish
the biological basis for the telescoping effect with opioids."

Climate change is a growing public health priority as extreme heat, wildfires, and other natural disasters have
led to acute effects on morbidity and mortality; yet, the long-term consequences of extreme heat and wildfires
have been sparsely studied. This is due in part to the paucity of studies with longitudinal information on
individual- and neighborhood-level factors and fine-scale climate and wildfire data. There is an urgent need to
investigate the long-term consequences of extreme heat and wildfires in well-designed studies that include a
comprehensive assessment of these exposures and their independent and joint effects on life expectancy,
coupled with a critical evaluation of possible mediators (air pollution) and moderators (socioeconomic status,
demographics, comorbidities, health behaviors, neighborhood environments, and geography). Furthermore,
the biological processes by which climate change affects mortality are not well understood. While evidence of
the impact of air pollution on DNA methylation as a measure of epigenetic regulation is accumulating, studies
of extreme heat and DNA methylation are sparse. Elucidation of the underlying pathways and the identification
of interventions for high-risk groups are needed. To address these gaps, we will conduct a rigorous
investigation of the impacts of extreme heat and wildfire smoke on adult life expectancy, leveraging the unique
epidemiological resources of the Multiethnic Cohort Study, a large population-based study that includes
112,000 adult men and women from California, who were ages 45-75 at enrollment in 1993-1996 and currently
ages 72-103 with strong representation of diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Specifically, we will
generate and characterize extreme heat and wildfire smoke for California Multiethnic Cohort participants
spanning a 24-year period (Aim 1); assess the impacts of long-term exposures of extreme heat and wildfire
smoke on life expectancy (Aim 2); and DNA methylation and epigenetic age (Aim 3). The strengths of this
proposal include: 1) the use of state-of-the-art exposure assessment methods to characterize extreme heat,
wildfire smoke, and important criteria air pollutants; 2) a large population-based sample with detailed individual-
and neighborhood-level data and sufficient power to detect modest effects that are broadly generalizable to
similar sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups in the US; 3) the assessment of the role of biological
pathways (DNA methylation) by which extreme heat and wildfire smoke may operate; and 4) a thorough
investigation of effect modification by a variety of factors including modifiable neighborhood environments as
well as the mediation of effects by air pollution. Findings from this proposal will expand our understanding of
the contribution of long-term extreme heat and wildfire smoke on life expectancy. This knowledge has
translational relevance in providing empirical evidence for policy makers and implementation scientists to
develop strategic interventions and response plans to combat the health effects of extreme heat and wildfire
smoke."
10857949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mammals have evolved several antibody isotypes capable of engaging distinct response pathways upon
subsequent recognition of antigen. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody isotype highly specialized to rapidly
and potently activate Type II effector cells. The deleterious role of IgE in allergic disease has been well-
described in the literature extending back to the early 20th century. However, the roles of IgE in homeostasis
and in host protection from disease remain poorly understood.
One approach to understanding the functional role(s) of antibody isotypes is through identifying targeted
antigens. Reactivity profiling has been performed for all antibody isotypes except for IgE and has been
informative in establishing the tissue sites, effector pathways, and functional consequences of antigen
recognition by specific antibody isotypes. The antigenic targets of IgE have not been broadly characterized to
date largely due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient antibody quantities for testing. We created a genetic tool
to both extend the half-life of IgE and to facilitate IgE purification, enabling high-throughput reactivity
screening. Preliminary data for this proposal showed that during homeostasis and after infectious challenge,
IgE and IgG recognized distinct sets of antigens. Some reactivities unique to the IgE antibody pool were
conserved under all tested conditions, suggesting that these antigen:antibody interactions are an important
component of fundamental IgE biology. Additional data demonstrated that homeostatic IgE had a profound
influence on the host response to acute inflammatory challenge, and that this influence was antigen-
dependent. We propose to fully resolve IgE reactivities in homeostasis (Aim 1), in relevant genetic and
environmental contexts (Aim 2), and ultimately to contextualize IgE effector function(s) within the host
response to acute inflammatory perturbation (Aim 3).

10858609,"Project Summary/Abstract
Breast surgeons have been highly successful at deimplementing some low-value surgical care
but less successful at deimplementing care that is preference-sensitive. Sentinel lymph node
biopsy for women ≥70 years of age (SLN over 70) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy
(CPM) have been deemed low-value by national surgical societies. However, use has remained
unchanged or even increased over time. Patients are frequently motivated to pursue these
operations because of perceived prognostic value or to minimize future cancer risk. However,
while SLN over 70 and CPM have no impact on survival, they may have a substantial negative
impact on psychosocial, physical, and financial outcomes. Surgeons endorse these operations
should not be routinely performed, but also acknowledge that the perceived benefits of the
procedures can outweigh the potential risks for some women. A critical gap towards supporting
deimplementation of low-value preference-sensitive care is our understanding of how decisions
are made within the patient-surgeon interaction. By directly studying patterns of conversation
associated with deimplementation, we can understand whether patients’ preferences are driving
the treatment plan and what tools may help surgeons support patients in these conversations.
In an R01 funded study (NCT03766009), we audio-recorded 594 surgical consultations from a
racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of breast cancer patients cared for at academic
and community centers across the United States. These consults have been transcribed and
the content categorized. The objective is to use this novel dataset to understand the relationship
between what surgeons and patients say during the consult, and how deimplementation
decisions for SLN over 70 and CPM are made. We have three aims: Aim 1, test the association
between performance of shared decision making and deimplementation of preference-sensitive
low-value care; Aim 2, identify patterns of surgeon-patient interactions that are associated with
deimplementation of preference-sensitive low-value care; Aim 3, develop a conversation guide
to support surgeons in discussing preference-sensitive low-value care.
This R21 study will generate key understanding about how decisions to deimplement
preference-sensitive low-value care are made within the patient-surgeon interaction. By
combining our insights with the existing literature on surgeon and patient attitudes and beliefs,
we will develop a multi-faceted strategy to support deimplementation of preference-sensitive
low-value care which can then be tested in a future R01 study."

 Placement of orthopaedic implants, such as guidewires and screws, is a common surgical
task, and accurate placement is critical to the success of a range of orthopaedic procedures.
However, the rate of screw misplacement is highly variable, with one study showing a 14%
misplacement rate in the spine. While screws are often placed during open surgery, allowing
direct visualization of bones, there is a growing trend toward percutaneous screw placement.
The most studied procedure has been pedicle screw placement, where a meta-analysis showed
that a significant percentage of screws are misplaced and that image guidance can improve
placement accuracy. Misplaced screws can put adjacent nerves, vessels, and joints at risk of
injury, leading to complications and revision surgery, which are often invasive and costly.
 The goal of this R01 proposal is to develop, evaluate, and prepare regulatory paperwork for
first clinical studies of a new technique for guiding implant placement in orthopaedic surgery.
The technique combines recent advancements in a low-profile robot with emerging methods for
image reconstruction and registration using a low-dose 3D cone-beam tomosynthesis (CBT)
system. Our long-term goal is to provide a complete solution for precision implant planning,
placement, and verification while minimizing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical staff.
This new methodology would allow surgeons to accurately place implants with fewer images,
reduce radiation exposure, and provide verification of device placement in the operating room
(OR), with opportunity for immediate revision. Our specific aims are to:
1. Develop a surgical navigation workstation based on the open-source software package 3D
 Slicer to integrate a low-profile guidance robot with 2D and 3D imaging for trajectory
 planning and robotic guidance of screw placement.
2. Develop and translate low-dose CBT for SCFE by identifying imaging protocols, optimizing
 reconstruction quality, and segmenting target structures using combined model-based and
 deep-learning techniques.
3. Develop and translate a 3D to 2D image registration and guidance system that exploits the
 rotating source to work off of a static C-arm gantry pose and track surgical instruments with
 respect to anatomy.
4. Integrate the technology developed in Specific Aims 1-3 and evaluate in phantom and
 cadaver studies. Modify as necessary to achieve less than 3 mm end-to-end targeting error.
5. Pursue an IDE submission to the FDA for first-in-human use in future work."
10857990,"Risk of death for Black patients with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is significantly
worse compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian patients even after adjusting for socioeconomic,
demographic and disease related effects. Survey data suggests that Black, Hispanic/Latino and
White patients agree that non-White patients with cancer are more likely than White patients to
receive poor quality care. <5% of the oncology workforce (i.e. medical, surgical, radiation
oncology etc.) identifies as an underrepresented minority (URM), which has implications for racial
bias, discrimination, and cultural compentency.
 The scientific premise of this proposal is based on the integration of spatial
transcriptomics and artificial intelligence (AI) pathomics to conduct a differential expression
analysis between Black and White patients with HPV-negative OPC. We have previous
experience using these approaches as a basis to understand gene expression changes between
Black and White patients with HPV-positive OPC, which is a distinct neoplastic entity when
compared to HPV-negative OPC. Therefore, we will identify differences in gene expression and
stromal and immune cell topology between Black and White patients to identify biologic
mechanism(s) that underlies racial disparities with respect to oncologic outcomes. Moreover,
within this research proposal, in partnership with minority serving schools, we will create two
pathways to address the disparity in the oncology workforce, including translational research. We
will address these gaps in the field by pursuing the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will
determine spatial gene expression differences Black vs. White patients with HPV-negative OPC.
In Aim 2, we will integrate spatial genomics and AI-guided pathomics between high vs. low
pathomic expression within tissue types, controlling for self-reported race and genetically
determined ancestry. To address the gap in URM in the oncology workforce, in Aim 3 we will
work in partnership with City of Medicine Academy and Howard University to provide a
longitudinal oncology research experience for high school students and surgical residents. In Aim
4, we will provide a laboratory incubator space in which URM Duke Faculty will be embedded to
pursue cancer research, along with mentoring from experienced and committed mentors.
 We propose to address these important issues and lack of reliable biomarkers for all
patients by integrating state-of-the-art techniques in genomics, pathomics, and AI, in a setting
fostering diversity and inclusion. The data generated will be of benefit to all patients with HPV-
negative OPCs as we are presently unable to identify poor responders regardless of race."

Veterans are at greater risk for progressive declines in function, lower quality of life, and frequent care needs.
While the VHA has established outpatient programs to address rehabilitation needs, these programs tend to
serve disease-specific populations (e.g. cardiac, stroke) on an episodic basis. Moreover, these programs often
do not meet the needs of medically complex older Veterans, as they typically 1) require in-person attendance,
2) under-dose the physiologic intensity of rehabilitation, and 3) lack self-management approaches for
preservation of function. Telehealth platforms offer a solution to redesign rehabilitation models of care for
medically complex older Veterans and can aid in overcoming access barriers (rurality, transportation), while
also integrating technologies to augment biobehavioral interventions and provide social support. Novel,
scalable telerehabilitation approaches targeting medically complex older Veterans are urgently needed to 1)
address physiologic impairments using progressive, high-intensity rehabilitation, 2) increase physical activity
with biobehavioral interventions which promote self-management, and 3) reduce social isolation and loneliness
via social support. Our proposed MultiComponent TeleRehabilitation (MCTR) program addresses current
healthcare deficiencies by using a multicomponent approach that includes both high-intensity rehabilitation
interventions and self-management interventions that are not part of traditional physical therapy interventions.
Therefore, we propose a two-arm, parallel randomized trial using a crossover study design to determine the
effectiveness (AIM 1) of a 12-week multicomponent telerehabilitation program to improve physical function. We
will also measure Veterans’ clinical outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCTR program to improve
physical activity, health self-management, and self-reported health (AIM 2). Lastly, we will explore the effects
of the MCTR program on safety events such as emergency room visits, hospitalizations, falls, and other
adverse events (AIM 3). Participants (n=126) will be randomized to MCTR or Control group using computer-
generated random blocks, stratified by sex. The MCTR group will participate in the 12-week program
consisting of 1) progressive, high-intensity rehabilitation, 2) self-management interventions, 3) social support,
and 4) technology supports. The 12-week program is split into two phases: the Active Phase (weeks 1-6) and
the Transition Phase (weeks 7-12). The Control group will participate in education and health status update
sessions in parallel to the MCTR 12-week program. Following the program, participants in the MCTR group will
complete a 12-week Sustainability Phase and the Control group will complete a 12-week no-intervention
phase. Outcomes will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (primary endpoint), and 24 weeks.
Achievement of the proposed aims will provide evidence to expand high quality telerehabilitation services for
medically complex older Veterans with multiple factors contributing to poor health (e.g., social isolation,
loneliness, physical inactivity, poor self-management). Importantly, results will guide the advancement of
rehabilitation practices, moving away from a traditionally narrow, episodic, diagnosis-focused approach to a
model emphasizing whole health self-management and sustained healthy living. Study findings will have
immediate clinical impact as they will be directly translatable to other medically complex and underserved
populations who will benefit from innovative telerehabilitation care approaches."
10858545,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the
leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in women, yet it is often undiagnosed until overt
complications have developed. Non-invasive tests can now identify “at-risk” NASH, defined as having the
highest risk for liver disease progression. Women of reproductive age commonly engage with healthcare
systems during their pregnancy care, providing a unique opportunity to identify “at-risk” NASH early,
particularly because metabolic changes in pregnancy may initiate and/ or worsen NAFLD progression. As
such, we first conducted a multidisciplinary protocol to screen for NAFLD in pregnant individuals, Fatty Liver in
Pregnancy (FLIP) I, in which we identified 1) a 14% overall prevalence of NAFLD in pregnant individuals, 2)
Hispanic ethnicity and pre-pregnancy weight as key predictors of NAFLD in pregnancy, and 3) in a pilot study
of postpartum assessment, found that 83% of individuals had worsening NAFLD grade post-delivery. Given
that hepatic lipid metabolism dysregulation plays a central role in NAFLD initiation and progression, in a
preliminary lipidomics analysis in FLIP I participants, we identified distinct lipidomic profiles in individuals with
NAFLD in pregnancy (compared to non-pregnant individuals with NAFLD), and clustering of polyunsaturated
fatty acid-derived oxidized fatty acids in individuals with NAFLD, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia,
emphasizing the potential shared role of these lipid pathways in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and these
adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). With our findings from FLIP I, we are now poised to study the
longitudinal influence of NAFLD in pregnancy, and associated lipid parameters, on women's health. In the
proposed FLIP II study, we seek to evaluate the evolution of NAFLD in pregnancy and its influence on
pregnancy outcomes, identify predictors for the development of “at-risk” NASH after pregnancy, and evaluate
the NAFLD driven lipid based mechanisms that predict these events. We will prospectively screen 1540
pregnant individuals for NAFLD (by ultrasound and Fibroscan) in early pregnancy and enroll them for
longitudinal follow up for up to one year postpartum. We will administer detailed questionnaires collecting
sociodemographic, dietary, and clinical data and collect and bank serum specimens for analysis. Our specific
aims are 1) To determine the association between NAFLD in pregnancy and APOs; 2) To evaluate antepartum
factors that predispose to “at-risk” NASH post-pregnancy; and 3) To investigate the lipidomics-based
mechanisms underlying NAFLD in pregnancy and its association with post-delivery “at-risk” NASH. By
uncovering novel insights into the natural history of NAFLD/ NASH in women in the pregnancy/ postpartum
period, our study will help stratify risk factors for NASH progression and provide valuable information for future
targeted interventions in this subgroup. Ultimately, this research will enhance our understanding of how NAFLD
influences both the course of pregnancy and the subsequent progression of maternal liver disease."
10858306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in many disease
states, including in cancer. Of these, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) MYC TF family members are notorious
drivers of oncogenic expression programs and are implicated in approximately 70% of all cancers. TFs influence
gene expression by binding to their cognate DNA sequences and recruiting the appropriate transcriptional
machinery to activate or inhibit gene expression. Although TFs are well-validated targets for cancer therapeutics,
the featureless nature of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions required for their function is resistant
to traditional drug development pipelines. Indeed, some small molecule inhibitors of bHLH-TF proteins have
been reported, but their low potency and unclear mechanism of action have stalled their translation into clinical
use. To address this challenge, we have developed a platform of fully synthetic, modular TF mimetics. Our
approach employs strategic chemical stabilization of peptide secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure to yield
synthetic transcriptional repressors (STRs) capable of binding target DNA sequences with high affinity and
specificity. The initial class of STRs, derived from the bHLH protein MAX, inhibit MYC/MAX-DNA binding and
block MYC-driven oncogenic phenotypes in cells. Building upon these preliminary data, this proposal aims to
explore and expand into novel STR architectures and validate lead STRs capable of opposing oncogenic gene
expression programs and phenotypes in animal models of MYC-driven cancers. Our expertise in synthetic
chemistry and biochemical profiling of TF function, as well as our established collaborations with leaders in the
fields of epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling and in vivo imaging, will be leveraged in the service of the
following specific aims: 1) structural and biochemical optimization of hyperstable and ultrapotent STRs targeting
MYC, 2) enhancing cellular and pharmacologic delivery of STRs coupled with quantitative mapping of STR-
reprogramming of epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes in MYC-dependent cancer cells, and 3) evaluation
of lead STRs in in vivo models of both MYC-dependent solid tumors (neuroblastoma) and liquid cancers
(lymphoma). Successful completion of these aims will generate potent, specific, and pharmacologically tenable
STRs and prioritize them for further study as MYC-targeted therapeutics. Beyond this direct goal, this work will
provide new insight into MYC-mediated gene regulation in cancer and establish a blueprint for the development
of STRs targeting other TF-dependent gene expression networks in the future."
10858769,"Abstract
The goal of personalized oncology is to select the most appropriate drug(s) for individual cancers.
A number of platforms (e.g., organoids and PDX mice) have been developed to generate human
cancer models for drug sensitivity testing, but they have yet to deliver on their promise as an
every-day clinical assay for use by oncologists. The major hurdles limiting success of
personalized drug sensitivity testing are the long turnaround time and the amount of starting
material needed, in addition to the loss of the original tumor microenvironment. To address these
shortcomings, we developed an elegant assay to evaluate drug sensitivity based on metabolic
changes in fresh tumor tissues obtained through needle biopsies. Our so-called MetaboCore
assay takes advantage of an optimized organotypic culture platform that is suitable drug testing
immediately upon specimen collection, and a novel single-cell metabolic assay that detects
changes in metabolism of cancer cells within a short time of drug exposure. Consequently,
quantitative results of relative drug sensitivity can be obtained within a week of the biopsy.
 In order to advance our assay towards clinical use, we need to create a robust SOP with
defined parameters for each step of the assay in order to achieve reproducible results. The
objectives of the proposal are to examine how biospecimen preanalytical conditions affect assay
performance. Specifically, we will quantify the effects of each of the following variables on tissue
viability and drug response: type and size of biopsy needles, transport solution, overnight storage,
culture conditions, recovery time, drug concentration, treatment duration, and protocols for tissue
dissociation. Based on these findings, we will create a SOP for MetaboCore and test its clinical
performance in a pilot study using needle biopsies of human liver cancers."

As clinical trials have high failure rates, in part due to reliance on animal testing that can produce inaccurate
results, accurate in vitro models of human physiology and disease are needed to bridge this gap. Recent
progress in organoid and organ-on-chip systems demonstrates promising potential to do this; however, in vitro
models have their own limitations. Stem cell derived models tend to have immature phenotypes, primary cell
derived models may be difficult to keep functioning for long periods of time, and in vitro models in general do
not recapitulate the full functionality of human organs. In an effort to increase the physiological relevance of
these systems, we have developed a cardiovascular microfluidic organoid chip, the µCV chip, which develops
according to biomimetic morphogen gradients, and can self-assemble into elongated tube-like structures when
the cells are seeded in specific starting geometries with a robotic seeding machine. These pumping tube-like
structures can generate flow autonomously in our microfluidic chips. Although this preliminary data is
compelling, it remains to be tested whether these tube-like structures have cellular spatial organization or
heart-like functionality that is more physiologically accurate than simpler cardiac spheroids. In this proposal, we
aim to systematically compare cardiovascular spheroids and cardiovascular tube-shaped microfluidic
organoids in depth, in order to further understand how the organization and functionality of organoids change
when seeded with different starting geometries and exposed to different flow conditions, and test the
hypothesis that tube-shaped flow-generating cardiovascular organoids have microphysiology more similar to a
simplified human heart. We will further expand the repertoire of our microfluidic organoid chip by teaming up
with colleagues in the Division of Liver Diseases to create hepatic organoids, both iPSC derived and primary
cell derived, in order to similarly evaluate differences in hepatic function when the organoids are created with
spheroid versus tubular geometries and exposed to different flow conditions. Finally, we will combine these two
microfluidic organoid systems into a single microfluidic heart-liver microphysiologic system, the µCV-MPS, and
characterize the two organoids as they co-develop and function within a single circulatory system. As the liver
is responds to flow and beat rate, and the heart responds to factors secreted by the liver, we hypothesize that
we will observe improvements in functionality, viability, and microphysiology by studying heart and liver
organoids while they are connected via paracrine signaling and homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. We will
additionally use the µCV-MPS as a model of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, which is known to lead to
cardiovascular disease including left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic disfunction, pathologies which we
hypothesize to be observable inthe µCV-MPS. Validation of this model system would represent a significant
step forward in the sophistication and capabilities of human MPS models, helping to provide more predictive
alternatives to animal models for next-generation therapeutic development and regulatory approval."

 Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlies vision loss following traumatic injuries and in optic
neuropathies like glaucoma. Treating these conditions requires interventions that promote RGC
neuroprotection and axon regeneration. While many such treatments have been identified in pre-clinical animal
models, none promote recovery, and typically treatment effects are limited to a small subset of RGCs. To
bridge the gap in understanding why treatments have incomplete effects, we took the approach of resolving
how axonal injury affects distinct RGC types and how each RGC type responds to regenerative interventions.
This approach revealed that RGC resilience and axon regeneration are highly cell type-dependent and
associate with high RGC activity levels. In this proposal, we will explore the mechanistic connections between
cell type-specific RGC activity, resilience, and axon regeneration.
 Neuronal activity mediates numerous cellular processes that could influence injury response including
immediate early gene expression, cAMP signaling, and Ca2+ dynamics. Indeed, increasing RGC activity by
neuromodulation promotes RGC survival and axon regeneration. However, we have limited insight into how
these approaches will work across RGC cell types, which have distinct functional properties and participate in
different neural circuits. Our experiments will employ cutting-edge multidisciplinary approaches to dissect the
molecular and physiological effects of neuromodulatory treatments on different RGC types. We will first
examine a signaling pathway mediated by Urocortin (UCN) and Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which
we recently discovered to promote RGC resilience and axon regeneration after axonal injury. UCN/CRH are
neuropeptides that increase neuronal excitability, but their function in RGCs and the mechanisms underlying
their neuroprotective and regenerative effects are unresolved. We will investigate both the native roles of
UCN/CRH in shaping RGC physiology and the effects of activating UCN/CRH signaling on mitigating RGC
injury response. Next, we will test the effects of increasing or decreasing RGC activity on injury response by
silencing RGC pre-synaptic inputs or by directly altering RGC membrane potential. Our work will be the first to
characterize the combined effects of injury and activity across cell types of a diverse neuronal population. We
will gain mechanistic insight into the connection between high RGC activity and selective resilience and axon
regeneration after injury. Our studies have strong potential to improve approaches for the treatment of RGC
degeneration and are also likely to elucidate generalizable principles mediating neuronal survival and axon
regeneration that will have implications for other neurodegenerative conditions."

Adoptive transfer of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) can provide effective treatment for non-
malignant disorders in the form of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or as a platform
for autologous gene therapy. Bone marrow (BM) niches are the operationally-defined core units that sustain
hematopoietic function, where signals from non-hematopoietic support cells adapt HSPC output to organismal
demand. HSPC occupancy in the BM, however, is a competitive process, and HSCT patients typically require
conditioning to eliminate endogenous hematopoiesis and “create space”, thereby promoting homing and
engraftment in highly vascularized niches. Secretory activity is a fundamental HSPC property, but the impact
of signals that emerge from HSPC, and their cellular targets in the niche are not well understood. The gap in
knowledge regarding the crosstalk between HSPC and vascular niche endothelial cells specifically, may hold
important biological insight and opportunities to improve competitive HSPC niche fitness, and a potentially
novel strategy to offset the toxicity and long-term side effects from HSCT conditioning treatments. The
secretion of nanometer sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) that traffic protein and RNA cargo is a constitutive
cellular function. Intriguingly, mobilized CD34+ HSPC -which provide known advantages to engraftment after
HSCT- have been shown to release EVs (EVCD34) that are highly abundant in microRNA-126, an “angiomiR”
that regulates Akt/mTOR signaling, which in turn is central to EC hematopoiesis support. Others showed that
adoptively transferred EVCD34, rich in miR-126, enhance EC proliferation and function. Our principal
hypothesis is that EVHSPC trafficking of miR-126 actively shapes EC function in the vascular BM niche
to enhance occupancy and improve repopulation. Three aims will test our hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will
determine the cell-autonomous impact of EVHSPC secretion on self-renewal and repopulation potency under
conditions of homeostasis and stress. Aim 2 will test the role of endothelial cells as predominant cellular
targets for EV trafficking in the BM niche. Aim 3 will dissect the specific role of miR-126 and in regulating BM
endothelial cell fates and the involved signaling pathways. As a proof of principle study, this proposal places
an experimental and mechanistic focus on EVHSPC, but insight into the biologic role of the HSPC secretome in
the BM niche will be broad. Translationally, our long-term goal is the development of new, non-toxic
approaches to improve outcomes after allogeneic HSCT and autologous gene therapy."

Several landmark discoveries in cancer genetics have come from studies on a rare childhood cancer of the
developing retina called retinoblastoma. In parallel, advances in preclinical testing and clinical research has led
to improvements in outcome for children with this devastating disease. Despite these advances, there are still
fundamental questions in the retinoblastoma field that remain unanswered. Are retinal cells fully transformed
once they sustain biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene or is retinoblastoma tumorigenesis a multistage
process? Why do some family members with the same germline RB1 mutation have bilateral multifocal
retinoblastoma at a young age while others have no evidence of disease? Can treatment induce a process of
tumor cell clonal evolution and selection that leads to tumor progression and enucleation? These questions
have been impossible to answer because retinoblastomas are not biopsied and enucleation is only performed
for advanced stage eyes. In order to overcome this barrier in the field, we have developed the first
spontaneous human retinoblastoma tumor model using 3D retinal organoids produced from patients with
germline RB1 mutations. I have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in computational and stem
cell biology, oncology, pathology, epidemiology and biostatistics to use this innovative new model of
retinoblastoma to answer fundamental questions in 3 specific aims. We will determine if retinoblastoma
progresses through a multistep process (Aim 1), if molecular, cellular or genetic factors contributes to
differences in penetrance and expressivity (Aim 2) and if there is clonal selection with treatment (Aim 3). I have
a proven record in retinoblastoma genetics and of moving basic science discoveries into clinical trials. This
proposal will impact patients with retinoblastoma through preclinical testing of a novel maintenance therapy
(Aim 3) to prevent new tumors from forming in the peripheral retina in the first few months after completion of
chemotherapy. It may also help to identify a subset of retinoblastoma survivors with germline RB1 mutations
that have an ultra-high risk of developing a 2nd malignancy and require more extensive cancer screening (Aim
2). No other center has the team, resources, expertise, or tools available to perform the studies presented
here and efficiently move the most promising findings directly into a clinical trial."
10834134,"Few viable treatments exist for patients with locally advanced or metastatic well-differentiated or
dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS), which are rare and often neglected orphan cancers. There are
approximately 1000 patients per year in the US diagnosed with WD/DDLS, and these cancers generally do not
respond to chemotherapy. Recent trials of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, motivated by the
finding that the CDK4 gene is amplified in >90% of WD/DDLS, show these agents stabilize disease that had
been growing prior to treatment and demonstrated clinically meaningful median progression-free survival (PFS) of
66% at 12 weeks but responses were uncommon.
 To enhance response rates and improve PFS benefit, we propose to combine the CDK4/6 inhibitor
palbociclib with an antibody against the immune checkpoint PD1. Checkpoint inhibitors have some activity in
DDLS, leading to partial responses in about 8% of patients. CDK4/6 inhibitors have been shown to increase
the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and to promote antitumor immunity in breast cancer patients and animal
models. In responsive tumors, CDK4/6 inhibitors trigger senescence, causing cells to secrete proinflammatory
cytokines and growth factors (termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP), suggesting
that these agents may enhance antitumor immunity.
 To identify patients likely to benefit from this combination therapy, we will investigate mechanisms of
response and resistance using pre- and on-treatment biopsy specimens from patients on the proposed phase
2 trial of palbociclib combined with the anti-PD1 antibody INCMGA0012. These studies will focus on the
cellular markers previously determined to be required for CDK4/6 inhibitor-induced senescence in WD/DDLS
(MDM2 turnover, cadherin 18 expression); markers of terminal senescence (Angplt4), antitumor immune
responses; and gene expression. Thus, our Specific Aims are to: (1) Assess the safety and efficacy of CDK4
inhibition using palbociclib in combination with PD1 blockade using INCMGA0012 in 30 patients with
WD/DDLS (outcomes: overall response rate, PFS, and overall survival); (2) Examine the roles of senescence,
terminal senescence and resultant SASP in response to the combination therapy and, their relationship with
immune response; and (3) Characterize the immune microenvironment (specifically CD8+ T cells and PDL1+
tumor cells) and tumor gene expression (assessed with immunohistochemistry and both bulk and single-cell
RNA sequencing) prior to and during combined treatment of palbociclib and INCMGA0012, and examine their
association with clinical response and outcome.
 Successful completion of this trial may lead to the introduction of a novel combination immunotherapy
strategy for WD/DDLS and identify predictive biomarkers for selection of patients most likely to benefit in both
sarcoma and other malignancies."
10834253,"Project Summary: The overall goal of our research program is to develop chemical tools and an in vivo pipeline
to delineate mechanisms of ferroptosis regulation by endogenous oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
Ferroptosis is a recently discovered iron-dependent non-apoptotic programmed cell death that is characterized
by an increase in membrane lipid peroxidation. Like other programmed cell death, ferroptosis has a broad impact
on cell and embryo development, cell senescence, tissue homeostasis, and many diseases. Several key proteins
and compounds that regulate ferroptosis have been identified, but the underlying mechanism of ferroptosis and
its endogenous mediators are poorly understood. This proposal is based on our research centered around PUFA
oxidative metabolism and health. Our research focuses on generating novel chemical tools to investigate the
mechanism of PUFA metabolites on human health. Specifically, we have developed multiple synthetic methods
to prepare cytochrome P450 (CYP) PUFA metabolites. We also designed and synthesized the corresponding
PUFA novel mimics. We applied these synthesized metabolites and mimics to identify many new biological
effects of PUFA CYP metabolites. To investigate the mechanism behind the biological effects of CYP PUFA
metabolites, we established C. elegans as a novel biological model in our lab due to the vast genetic tools
available and the adaptability for high-throughput screening. All of these features greatly facilitate mechanistic
studies. Using C. elegans, we found that endogenous PUFAs and the corresponding CYP metabolites induce
ferroptosis only in the germline and neurons. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis for this
proposal is that PUFA metabolites are endogenous lipid mediators of ferroptosis. To significantly advance
the understanding of this novel programmed cell death, this R35 will address two questions: 1) What are the
endogenous signaling molecules of ferroptosis? And 2) How is ferroptosis regulated in a cell type-specific
manner? In the next five years, we will use PUFA metabolites, metabolite mimics, and metabolic inhibitors that
we will synthesize in combination with a novel model organism (C. elegans) and their vast genetic tools to answer
our scientific questions by 1) identifying endogenous PUFA metabolites that trigger or inhibit ferroptosis and 2)
developing a novel in vivo platform to delineate cell-specific ferroptosis regulatory pathways.
Understanding how oxidized PUFA metabolites trigger ferroptosis in specific cell types will have implications for
how ferroptosis may affect human health. The outcomes from this proposal will build a strong foundation for our
future research on multiple levels. The identified lipid mediators and protein targets will be further tested in
mammalian models for research translation and mechanistic studies. The discovery of lipid mediators and protein
targets also allows us to develop drug candidates to treat diseases related to ferroptosis. The developed
transgenic strains and in vivo platform will allow us to identify novel signaling molecules or protein targets that
regulate cell-type specific ferroptosis. We will continue to develop novel chemical tools to investigate ferroptosis."

To develop novel, transformative therapies that substantially reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality from
progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a fundamentally new conceptualization of PF is required. It is becoming
clear that lung fibrosis is a consequence, rather than the primary driver, of disease pathobiology and
represents the culmination of a lengthy period of pre-clinical disease progression driven by repetitive cycles of
epithelial injury and dysfunctional repair. Rather than focusing on slowing progression of established PF, we
propose that therapeutic efforts should be directed at preventing the development of symptomatic PF. This
Program will focus primarily on the pre-symptomatic period, which represents the ideal time for interventions to
modify the course of PF. Our overall objective is to re-shape understanding of the natural history of PF by
investigating the transcriptomic, genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and exposome-related signatures that
contribute to disease initiation and early progression. Our long-term goals are to use the knowledge gained in
this Program to develop new strategies for pre-clinical risk stratification and to identify novel approaches for
disease prevention and treatment. This Program consists of 4 Projects and 3 Cores and will leverage our
ongoing cohort study of asymptomatic relatives of patients with familial PF (FPF). Project 1 titled “Mechanisms
of Early Disease Progression in FPF” will investigate single-cell transcriptomics from blood and
bronchoalveolar lavage cells to identify critical mechanisms driving pre-clinical FPF and develop better
biomarkers for identification of early disease. Project 2 titled “Environmental Exposures in Pre-Clinical FPF” will
use cutting-edge technology combined with standardized assessments to measure real-time exposures and
identify specific environmental toxins that contribute to the early development of PF. Project 3 titled “Functional
genomic mechanisms of epithelial dysfunction in Pulmonary Fibrosis” will utilize single-cell multiomics from
lung biopsies and patient-derived organoid models to investigate the mechanisms through which genetic
factors interact with environmentally-driven stimuli to drive the initiation and progression of PF. Project 4 titled
“Defining the molecular natural history of early and progressive pulmonary fibrosis” will utilize state-of-the-art
spatial transcriptomic technologies and ex vivo culture models to generate a spatially-resolved molecular atlas
of pre-clinical and progressive PF. The Administrative Core houses expertise to manage and support the entire
program, the Clinical and Biospecimen Core will conduct all studies involving human subjects, and the
Genomics Core will support data acquisition, analysis, storage, and dissemination. Together, we anticipate that
the highly-integrated and synergistic nature of this proposal will result in a revolution in understanding of early
PF pathogenesis and facilitate future studies aimed at disease prevention."

Soil-transmitted helminth infections are estimated to infected two billion people worldwide, remaining one of the
most neglected groups of infectious diseases and a significant public health and economic challenge. Infected
individuals can suffer from malnutrition, growth retardation, impaired cognitive function, anemia and severe
immunopathology as a result of chronic inflammation. Immunity to helminth parasites is dependent on type 2
inflammatory responses, characterized by activation of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2), eosinophils, alternatively-activated macrophages, and B cell production of IgE and IgG. These protective
type 2 responses are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, including diet and microbiota-derived
metabolites. Therefore, further studies are urgently needed to understand the mechanistic basis of how these
factors influence type 2 immune responses to improve strategies to treat and prevent allergic diseases and
intestinal helminth infections. The microbiota is the source of various metabolites which can exert their effects at
the site of absorption (intestine), as well at distant sites such as brain via bloodstream. Since various dietary
components, including dietary fiber, influence the composition of the microbiota and the types of metabolites the
microbiota produces, many of the effects of diet on immune cells can be mediated via the microbiota. However,
the influence of dietary fiber on microbiota-derived metabolites and their roles in regulating type 2
immunity and inflammation in the context of allergic responses or helminth infection remain poorly
defined. Our new preliminary studies in mice employing untargeted comparative metabolomic analyses
identified that a high fiber diet drives a significant shift in the composition of the microbiota and remarkable
changes in the levels of microbiota-derived metabolites. This metabolic reprogramming was associated with the
development of a proinflammatory type 2 immune response, characterized by activation of group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s), accumulation of eosinophils, and accelerated parasite expulsion in a murine model of
helminth infection. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that high fiber diet-induced modulation of
microbiota-derived metabolites promotes ILC2-induced type 2 inflammation and immunity to helminth parasite
infection. Based on these preliminary data, studies outlined in Aim 1 will test which microbiota-derived
metabolites activate ILC2s and trigger eosinophilia and type 2 inflammation to promote anti-parasite immunity.
In Aim 2, we will employ chemical and genetic approaches to test how the microbiota-intrinsic bile acid metabolic
pathway regulates dietary fiber-induced type 2 inflammation and immunity to infection. Upon successful
completion of our proposed aims, we expect to contribute to a fundamentally new understanding of the biology
of fiber diet, microbiota-derived metabolites, and ILC2s in regulating type 2 inflammation and anti-helminth

working groups, and supporting early career investigators through the collaborative engagement of a large
core of senior SF CRS investigators (five with K24 awards) who have outstanding mentorship skills, with the
goal of developing a new generation of skilled translational scientists. The SF CRS will provide leadership in
several domains of vital importance to the MWCCS scientific agenda including HIV pathogenesis,
neurocognitive impairment and brain structure/function, genomics, cardiac electrophysiology, pharmacology,
informatics, and comorbidities. Specifically, we propose to: 1) contribute to the understanding of the HIV
reservoir through deep phenotyping of leukocyte populations in peripheral blood, gut tissue, endocervical and
seminal cells; 2) examine the relationship of HIV and gonadal aging on deficits in neurocognitive functioning;
3) pursue novel electrocardiographic studies to evaluate subclinical cardiac and neurocognitive injury in
PLWH; 4) leverage linked studies to better understand inter-relationships of multiple morbidities (e.g., cardiac,
peripheral vascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, neurocognitive, physical function; and 5) lead genomic (e.g.,
genetic, epigenetic, mitochondrial) discovery efforts on the outcomes evaluated in the MWCCS."

The overarching strategy of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) clinical research site (CRS) together with our
collaborative clinical site at The Ohio State University (OSU) of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS)/Woman’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS CCS) is to support,
complement and accelerate the CCS unified scientific agenda (USA) by leveraging the strengths and scientific
expertise of CRS investigators. We propose to continue to expand on our 35 years of extensive research on the
natural history of HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that, as men and women with
chronic HIV infection age, they increase their risks for serious, life-shortening comorbidities beyond those of
comparable age, uninfected persons, and this could differ between men and women. As directed by NIH RFA-
HL-19-008, the CRS will provide robust and inclusive leadership focused on five specific aims of the USA, and
targeted collaborative support for the five other aims, to improve our understanding of the epidemiologic, clinical,
virologic, immunologic, and behavioral relationships of HIV infection to chronic comorbidities in men and women
that represent the current HIV epidemic in the United States. The CRS will also contribute longitudinal data and
biological specimens for collaborative research projects on HIV led by CCS and non-CCS investigators. This
research is important to fulfill our mission of improving clinical management, increasing survival and controlling,
preventing and curing HIV infection. The CRS will provide the most current and innovative epidemiological,
clinical and laboratory methods and psychosocial research protocols to accomplish our 5 leadership specific
aims. The Pitt/OSU CRS will be led by a triumvirate of MPIs and several CoIs with broad expertise needed to
lead five highly specialized CCS USA Specific Aims (Aim 2: Pulmonary/Sleep [Morris]; Aim 3: Neurocognitive
[Becker]; Aim 6: HIV/Pathogenesis [Macatangay]; Aim 7: Psychosocial [Stall]; Aim 9: Platform [Rinaldo,
Kingsley]) and to provide insight for the 5 other Specific Aims (Aim 1: Cardiovascular [Kingsley, Martinson], Aim
4: Aging [Koletar], Aim 5: Cancer [Jenkins], Aim 8: Health Disparities [Krier], Aim 10: Career Development [Sluis-
Cremer]. With this plan the Pitt/OSU CRS addresses the basic justification of the FOA, i.e., that the impact of
HIV, its treatment, and the legacy of immune suppression need to be more fully understood to optimize the health
of people living with HIV."

 This project aims at elucidating the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA transcription in hepatocytes, focusing on viral X protein (HBx)-
mediated epigenetic regulation of HBV cccDNA with involvement and fine balancing of host epigenetic
modulators. HBV cccDNA is essential to the virus life cycle, its complete elimination or inactivation during chronic
infection is considered critical to a cure but has not been achieved by current antivirals. HBV cccDNA exists in
the cell nucleus as an individual minichromosome decorated with histones and non-histone proteins. Elucidating
the mechanisms of chromatin compactization of cccDNA and principles of epigenetic regulation of cccDNA
episome in its interplay with host factors could allow us to elaborate new antiviral strategies for addressing the
unmet clinical need. Among the limited number of HBV-encoded proteins, the viral regulatory protein HBx serves
as a multifunctional transactivator of the viral and cellular promoters and has been proven to be a potent
epigenetic modifying factor in HBV-infected livers. To further address the role of HBx in cccDNA transcription,
we have developed a pair of inducible cccDNA reporter stable cell lines with and without HBx expression, namely
HepBHAe82 and HepBHAe∆x67. While both cell lines are able to produce comparable level of cccDNA
regardless of the presence or absence of HBx, the cccDNA in HepBHAe∆x67 cells is epigenetically silenced.
The HBx-dependent cccDNA transcription has also been recapitulated in wildtype and HBx-minus HBV infected
hepatocytes. In this project, by making use of these experimental systems, we will systematically characterize
the epigenetic profile variations between transcriptionally active and inactive cccDNA (Aim 1), map the interaction
of cccDNA minichromosome with host chromosomes (Aim 2), and identify host epigenetic modulators that
regulate cccDNA transcription through comparative proteomic approach, followed by functional validation (Aim
3). In Aim 3, we have already identified HMGB1 as a novel host restriction factor for cccDNA, and will further
elucidate the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated epigenetic repression of cccDNA transcription and the interplay
between HBx and HMGB1 in cccDNA activation. The accomplishment of this project will shed more light on the
cccDNA epigenetics, and provide novel antiviral targets for development of therapeutics that epigenetically
silence cccDNA to achieve a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B."

Overview: The goal of this award is to provide Dr. Ami Patel with the training and mentored research experience
to ensure success in her transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the biology and treatment of
myeloid malignancies. Dr. Patel’s long term goal is to create and support an independent laboratory-based
translational research program dedicated to the investigation of targeted drug resistance in myeloid neoplasms.
Research: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy associated with
dismal survival outcomes and low curative potential. Treatment options are extremely limited, poorly tolerated
and fail to address many disease-related symptoms. Targeted agents represent a promising therapeutic
opportunity for CMML patients with mutations that lead to aberrant signal transduction through the RAS/mitogen
activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. The proposed research aims to understand whether this subset of CMML
patients could benefit from treatment with cobimetinib, a specific inhibitor of RAS/MAPK signaling. The proposal
includes a clinical trial to test the efficacy of cobimetinib in CMML patients with RAS/MAPK activation.
Unfortunately, clinical experience with targeted inhibitors support the eventual emergence of drug resistance.
The proposed research aims to understand, prevent and overcome anticipated MEK inhibitor resistance.
Longitudinal samples from patients treated on the cobimetinib trial will be analyzed using whole exome and RNA
sequencing to identify biomarkers of drug resistance. Laboratory-based preclinical studies will utilize advanced
high throughput sequencing and target validation methodologies in cell lines, primary CMML cells and patient
derived xenograft models of CMML to help identify mechanisms of resistance that can be cross-referenced with
clinical trial findings. Pathways implicated in MEK inhibitor resistance may be candidates for targeted inhibition,
leading to the development of novel combinatorial treatment strategies in RAS-activated CMML.
Career Development: Dr. Patel is an accomplished hematologist-oncologist with a strong background in
translational research in myeloid malignancies. However, prior to starting an independent research program,
Dr. Patel requires further training in advanced sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, genome editing and
techniques and clinical trial implementation and oversight. The structured protected time,didactics and
mentoring provided by the K08 will allow Dr. Patel to complete this essential training. Dr. Patel has assembled
a highly experienced, diverse and internationally-recognized mentoring team committed to her future success.
The Huntsman Cancer Institute, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the University of Utah
provide a rich and supportive institutional environment for Dr. Patel to advance her career."
10832696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 10-20% of women, with immigrant Latinas disproportionately affected.
PPD prevention and treatment is limited among immigrant Latinas due to an array of structural and cultural
factors, suggesting the need to deliver interventions outside of traditional healthcare settings. Virtual
interventions have the potential to reduce barriers to mental health services for immigrant Latinas, but there is
little research on the effectiveness of virtual interventions to reduce PPD symptoms. Mothers and Babies is an
evidence-based group intervention based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy and attachment theory
aimed at PPD prevention. Mothers and Babies was adapted for delivery via a virtual group format (Mothers
and Babies Virtual Group; MB-VG), with a pilot study suggesting good feasibility and acceptability as well as
improved mental health outcomes for immigrant Latinas. The proposed project is a Type 1 Effectiveness-
Implementation randomized controlled trial among pregnant individuals and new mothers at risk for PPD based
on elevated depressive symptoms and/or other established risk factors who are enrolled in early childhood
programs across Maryland. A total of 300 women will be enrolled; 150 will receive MB-VG while 150 will
receive usual family support services. The project aims to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of MB-VG to reduce
depressive symptoms, prevent onset of PPD, and improve parenting self-efficacy and responsiveness; 2)
implementation of MB-VG; and 3) contextual factors influencing MB-VG effectiveness and implementation. An
exploratory aim will also examine child self-regulation and school readiness outcomes among participants
(~N=150) who have older children aged 2.5-4.5 years. Trained early childhood center staff will deliver MB-VG
sessions, with intervention participants receiving virtual group sessions via Zoom using any electronic device
(smartphone, tablet, laptop). Maternal self-report surveys are conducted at baseline, 1 week, 3 months, and 6
months post-intervention, with structured clinical interviews also conducted at 3- and 6-months post-
intervention. Key informant interviews with MB-VG facilitators and recipients, as well as early childhood
program directors will provide data on MB-VG implementation and contextual factors influencing
implementation. Fidelity of MB-VG delivery will be assessed via rigorous coding of intervention session audio
recordings. Our study is the first to deliver a virtual PPD preventive intervention to immigrant Latinas and to
evaluate its impact. Given its virtual delivery modality, MB-VG can be easily replicated and scaled to other
family support programs and settings serving immigrant Latinas. If effective and implemented broadly, more
immigrant Latinas will receive mental health services and fewer will suffer the negative consequences
associated with PPD. The proposed project is aligned with NIMHD’s high priority areas, including developing
and testing interventions to reduce disparities."

Light has a profound effect on human physiology and behavior. In mammals, intrinsically photosensitive retinal
ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a key role in light-dependent behaviors, including circadian photoentrainment,
pupillary light reflex, sleep, mood, memory and learning. Originally thought to be a homogeneous population,
ipRGCs are now known to be a diverse collection of cells with six subtypes (M1-6) in mouse. These subtypes
differ in many ways, including expression levels of the photopigment melanopsin, dendritic stratification, synaptic
inputs, firing patterns, and central projection targets in the brain. These ipRGCs respond to light by integrating
intrinsic melanopsin-based phototransduction and extrinsic synaptic inputs driven by conventional rod and cone
outer retinal photoreceptors. Early studies suggested that melanopsin phototransduction utilizes exclusively a
Gq-signaling cascade that leads to the activation of Plc4 and TrpC-family ion channels. This model has been
challenged, however, by discovery of alternative signaling pathways in non-M1 ipRGCs, but the precise identity
of the signaling components remains controversial. These findings have thereby revealed a large gap in
knowledge about the identity of the downstream components of melanopsin’s phototransduction cascade.
Furthermore, we have recently shown that melanopsin signaling can be regulated by dopamine, a well-known
neuromodulator in the retina, in a cell culture system. Our overall goal for this proposal is to understand how the
complexity of the melanopsin-based signaling pathway and its regulation in distinct ipRGC subtypes contributes
to the large array of behaviors. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the physiological and behavioral
consequences of dopamine-dependent melanopsin phosphorylation in M1 ipRGCs, using a knock-in mouse
model, in which phosphorylation sites in melanopsin are mutated. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify distinct roles
of M1 and M4 ipRGCs in light-dependent behaviors by subtype-selective manipulation of phototransduction
pathways. These studies will provide a critical understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by
which light influences human health and performance through the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep, mood,
memory and learning."

The immune system, especially the T cell component, is particularly sensitive to ionization radiation (IR), and
epidemiologic data, such as the A-bomb cohort, have demonstrated dysfunction and perturbed T cell
homeostasis even decades after exposure. While measurable acute effects of radiation on T cell populations
and activation have been observed in vivo and in vitro, the long-term physiologic consequences on T cell
immunity in acute-radiation-syndrome survivors and multi-organ injury mediated by immune dysfunction, as
well as the underlying mechanisms, still have considerable uncertainty. Using a bacterial infection model, we
have recently observed that the pathogen loads were higher in the irradiated mice at months after IR. We can
connect this compromised protective immunity against pathogens with impaired T cell immunity, where we
have reported abnormal immune metabolic reprogramming and perturbations in specific metabolic pathways in
activated T cells after IR. With the growing appreciation of interactions between metabolism and immune cell
function, it is increasingly appreciated that distinct metabolic needs in naïve, effector, and memory T cells
require proper metabolic reprogramming to maintain effective T cell immunity after IR. One aim will be to
dissect metabolic perturbations in T cells in various activation/differentiation stages as they contribute to
pathogen immunity. A bacterial infection murine model will be used to assess the long-lasting effects of IR on
changes on T cell immunity in a physiologic context. We will focus on CD8+ T cells in this study, because CD8+
subpopulations are more sensitive to IR-caused damage than CD4+, and secondly, they are critical for immune
defense against intracellular pathogens, including viruses and bacteria. In addition to altering T cell
metabolism, we expect that IR also induces distinct systemic metabolic changes, including those in lymphoid
tissue and mucosal niche, as shown in our published metabolomic studies. Pro-inflammatory metabolites may
synergize with IR-induced premature senescence and drive a positive feedback loop resulting in multi-organ
injury. In this project we will examine the impact of the senescence-associated inflammatory phenotype on T
cell metabolism and immune functions, and assess interventions using senescent cell ablation approach.
Considering that in a real-life nuclear incident, an exposure to mixed fields of neutrons and photon is highly
likely, we have already observed distinct differences between mixed field metabolic responses compared to
single photon or neutron beams. So we will investigate the late effects of mixed neutron/photon radiation on T
cells’ metabolism. We also plan to address the question how a radiomitigator modulates those IR-caused long-
lasting effects including a senolytic approach. The successful completion of these aims will help to better
understand how radiation causes persistent immune dysfunction in ARS survivors. The new concept of
metabolic perturbations of T cells in specific activation/differentiation stages, e.g., naïve vs memory T cells, will
lay the foundation for strategies for preventative intervention."

A principle aim of the NINDS is to determine how motor control is successfully implemented by
the nervous system. Locomotion and balance are complex motor functions that are largely
controlled by complex microcircuits that reside outside the brain. Understanding how such
microcircuits function is critical to being able to treat diseases related to age, congenital disorders,
and trauma in which these circuits are impaired. This proposal will leverage advantages of a highly
tractable model system, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), to elucidate the computational
principles underlying the sensorimotor circuits that govern flight stabilization. Fruit flies are an
excellent model system for conducting such studies for several reasons. First, through a
collaborative project with the HHMI, the PI has helped develop ~220 transgenic fly lines targeting
sparse populations of neurons in the fly ventral nerve cord (VNC), which can be chronically
silenced, optogenetically activated, or optogenetically suppressed. Second, in experiments
pioneered by the PI, we showed that the reflexive responses of the fly to yaw, pitch, and roll
perturbations are described quantitatively by a proportional-integral controller—a control strategy
similar to a car’s cruise control or a sophisticated thermostat. Thus, the fly’s stabilization reflexes,
while complex, are well characterized. Consequently, there is an opportunity to systematically
interrogate neurons in the VNC and determine their effect on a sophisticated motor behavior.
Towards this end, in Aim 1 we will map the function of the motor system that actuates rapid flight
stabilization in flies. Specifically, we will chronically silence or transiently manipulate individual
motor neurons that innervate wing steering muscles and test control performance in free flight
and under rapid mechanical perturbations. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the functional role specific
mechanosensory neurons in the control reflex. Once again we will use chronic silencing or
transient manipulation of individual mechanosensory neurons and test control performance in free
flight and under rapid mechanical perturbations. Finally, in Aim 3 we will identify the neural
architecture connecting the mechanosensory inputs to the wing muscle outputs. Specifically, we
will use anterograde transsynaptic circuit tracing (trans-Tango) and ex-vivo functional imaging to
identify motor and interneurons that receive direct input from the genetically-identified
mechanosensory afferents. Together, these studies will enable us to determine with
unprecedented detail the organization and function of these microcircuits. In turn, this knowledge
will inform our understanding of design principles for sensorimotor circuits across animals."
10833674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human cells respond to foreign agents such as pathogens and toxins by initiating a strong innate defense
response that creates a protective environment in the cells and incapacitates the invading pathogens and
foreign substances. The initiation, activation, and resolution of this innate defense response is a carefully
regulated process designed to avoid both hyperactivation and underactivation, either of which can lead to
tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and microbial diseases.
A key strategy that cells use to achieve tight regulatory control of innate defense signaling is the alteration of
protein post-translational modifications (PTMs: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, etc.). The goal of
my lab for the next five years will be to explore the role of an understudied PTM, the site-specific proteolysis,
in regulating innate defense signaling. I have extensive experience in studying antiviral innate immune
responses, and have recently optimized a robust protein N-terminal labeling approach that provides an
unbiased view of site-specific proteolysis in cells — expertise that will enable me to decipher the regulatory
functions of site-specific proteolysis in innate defense mechanisms.
With this MIRA award, my group will pursue two specific research directions. First, we will determine the role
of the proteolytic N-end rule pathway in controlling the stability of proteins involved in defense signaling.
Second, we will investigate the ways in which internal protein cleavages activate defense responses. For the
proposed studies, we will employ a combination of focused molecular biology investigations and systems
biology approaches, such as activity-based protease profiling and protein N-terminal labeling. These efforts
will generate new knowledge about the role of proteases in the regulation of cellular defenses and inform the
development of strategies to improve the performance of innate defense mechanisms against escalating
microbial and environmental threats."

The goal of this training program in environmental toxicology is to produce scientists and engineers
professionally qualified to make original contributions to improved understanding of the impacts of
environmental agents, especially hazardous chemicals, on human health. This program has supported 112
predoctoral and 94 postdoctoral Trainees since its inception in 1975. During that same time period, 356 PhD
or ScD degrees have been awarded to all students in the MIT toxicology program (Trainees plus non-
Trainees). Of our pre-doctoral and post-doctoral Trainees over the past 15 years, 8 out of 66 (12%) are in
academic positions and 42 (64%) are in industry or government, with the balance continuing in training.
Trainees pick projects from the following areas: (1) analysis of genome-, proteome- and glycome-level
responses to toxins and toxicants; (2) characterization of mutagenic responses to carcinogens as expressed
hierarchically at the genome, cell, tissue, organism and population levels of organization; (3) construction of
novel animal models for determining the effects of exposure of mammals to environmental agents; (4) systems
biology of kinase-mediated signaling cascades triggered in response to toxic agents, and during neoplastic
transformation; (5) characterization of the chemistry underlying the reaction of toxins and toxicants with cellular
macromolecules and other targets; (6) mechanistic assessment of the contribution of DNA damage to genetic
disease, and identification of the cellular defenses (e.g., DNA repair strategies) that protect against heritable
damage; (7) engineering-based design of novel model systems for evaluating responses to toxic agents; (8)
unraveling the underlying biology of environmental chemical-infectious agent interactions; and (9) development
of analytical methods for monitoring hazardous chemicals in the environment, and determining of how those
agents chemically change over time. In the previous period of support, 29% of the PhD students supported
were from underrepresented groups, and 59% were female. Regarding postdocs, 18.2% were from
underrepresented groups, and 55% of the cohort was female. More than 600 students apply for the pre-
doctoral program annually, allowing for good program selectivity.
Highlights of the program are a well-structured and constantly updated academic toxicology Certificate
Program taken by PhD students, a pre- and post-doctoral mentoring program, numerous toxicology-focused
seminar programs and a large emphasis on research collaboration. We created a course entitled
Fundamentals of Toxicology and Environmental Health to cross-train our diverse group of engineers and
scientists. It includes formal toxicology lectures, training in responsible conduct of research, authentication of
reagents, rigor and reproducibility, data science and community outreach.
This proposal requests funding for seven predoctoral and six postdoctoral trainees."

With rare exceptions, proteins in all domains of life are biosynthesized using the same twenty canonical
amino acid building blocks. However, the chemical and functional space accessible to proteins are greatly
expanded in living systems by a wide variety of different post-translational modifications (PTMs). These
PTMs play important roles in all aspects of our biology. In recent years, the catalog of known PTMs within
our proteome have expanded at a furious pace, thanks to advances in mass-spectrometry based proteomics
and related technologies. However, functional consequences of the overwhelming majority of these newly
identified PTMs remain poorly characterized. At the core of this deep knowledge-gap on a critically important
facet of our biology lies the difficulty of producing eukaryotic proteins in a homogeneous state of modification
for probing how their properties are modulated by a PTM in vitro or in vivo. For most PTMs identified through
MS-proteomics, the exact biochemical origin is either unknown or challenging to reconstitute without
additional pleiotropic consequences. Genetic code expansion (GCE) technology provides an exciting solution
for this problem by enabling co-translational site-specific incorporation of a modified residue into virtually any
site of any protein. However, despite its enormous potential, the scope of this technology in eukaryotic
systems remains limited by several technical challenges, including the restricted structural diversity of
noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) that can be genetically encoded, poor efficiency of their incorporation,
etc. Over the last five years, our group has greatly expanded the scope of this technology by developing
innovative solutions to overcome these longstanding challenges, including: A) new platforms for genetically
encoding previously inaccessible ncAAs, B) a mammalian cell-based directed evolution system to improve
the performance of this machinery, and C) novel viral vectors that efficiently deliver the ncAA incorporation
machinery to wide variety of mammalian cells and tissues. These advances have opened the exciting
opportunity to use this powerful technology to systematically decipher the role of various PTMs observed in
the human proteome. To this end, in the next five years, we propose to develop new GCE platforms to access
new structural classes of ncAAs, use them to genetically encode previously inaccessible PTMs in eukaryotes,
optimize their efficiency through directed evolution, and use them to decipher the consequences of PTMs.
Furthermore, we will develop technology to systematically explore new protein-protein interactions triggered
by PTMs (e.g., with reader/eraser proteins), by site-specifically incorporating two ncAAs: one modeling the
PTM of interest and another harboring a photo-crosslinker. Finally, by overcoming longstanding challenges,
we will dramatically advance the scope of the GCE technology for application in mammalian cells, which will
have broad and deep impact far beyond the scope of this proposal."

Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show severe deficits in self-agency (i.e., the experience of being the agent of
one's own thoughts and actions), that directly contribute to debilitating psychotic symptoms and distort reality
monitoring (i.e., defined as distinguishing self-generated information from externally-derived information).
Current medications are inadequate with up to 40% of SZ remaining symptomatic, thus compelling the need to
understand the neurobiology underlying self-agency deficits which we believe drives psychotic experiences in
SZ. Here, we test for the first time a novel causal cognitive and neurobiological model underlying self-agency
with the aim of developing new effective treatments in SZ. In particular, we examine whether the resulting
experience of self-agency is driven by the fundamental ability to make reliable predictions about the outcomes
of one's own self-generated actions. This self-prediction ability is critical for the successful encoding and memory
retrieval of one's own thoughts and actions during reality monitoring to enable accurate self-agency judgments
(i.e., accurate identification of self-generated information). This self-prediction ability is also critical for speech
monitoring where we continually compare what we hear while we speak with what we expect to hear. Prior
studies have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a potential neural substrate that mediates both
lower-level self-predictions during speech monitoring, and higher-level self-agency judgments during reality
monitoring in healthy controls (HC). Here, we now test whether mPFC activity can causally modulate this self-
prediction ability to impact self-agency on two different tasks of reality and speech monitoring. We propose a
longitudinal randomized controlled trial in which HC and SZ are assigned to 5 daily sessions of either active high-
frequency 10Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to increase mPFC activity or to sham TMS. We use
repeated measures of magnetoencephalography imaging (MEGI) to assay neural activity underlying self-agency
on reality and speech monitoring tasks from pre-to-post TMS at time-points: (i) baseline, (ii) proximal post-TMS
(i.e., right after TMS intervention), and (iii) distal post-TMS (i.e., 1 week after TMS intervention). The specific
aims are to delineate with MEGI, proximal and distal mechanisms of how active 10Hz TMS modulates mPFC
activity in HC and SZ to induce neural network and behavioral changes in self-agency in reality and speech
monitoring tasks, compared to baseline and sham. The overall hypothesis is that high frequency TMS will
increase mPFC excitability and enhance self-predictions to improve self-agency on distinct tasks of speech and
reality monitoring. If successful, this project will establish mPFC as a new biological target for TMS therapies in
SZ, and will show that mPFC provides a unitary basis for self-agency driven by reliance on self-predictions. The
long-term objective is to delineate mechanisms of durability and generalizability of how improvements in critical
self-agency abilities after TMS of mPFC, can generalize to improvements in cognition, symptoms and life quality
in SZ for future TMS treatment development."

Anxiety and depression are among the most debilitating disorders worldwide and increase the
risk for later-life adverse health outcomes including chronic anxiety and depression, substance
abuse and suicide. Anxiety and depression are also the most common psychiatric disorders
among adolescents with symptoms presenting as early as 4-5 years of age. Yet, we still have a
poor understanding of the etiology of anxiety and depression in youth and the mechanisms
involved. Air pollutants are widely recognized for their ability to affect the central nervous system
and adversely impact neurodevelopment during childhood. The epigenome is particularly
sensitive to environmental stimuli and studies targeting inflammatory and oxidative stress
pathways have identified DNA methylation changes resulting with exposure to air pollutants.
Oxidative stress and inflammation, however, are not the only pathways involved in air pollution
neurotoxicity or the pathophysiology of mental health disorders. Thus, utilizing an epigenome-
wide platform may help identify novel biomarkers of exposure and effect which may otherwise
be overlooked with a targeted approach. The goal of this proposal is to determine whether
exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) during
childhood and adolescence impacts the epigenome and whether changes in DNA methylation
can be used to identify children at increased risk for anxiety and depression. Using the
Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) and Health Outcomes and
Measures of the Environment (HOME) study birth cohort, we will: 1) conduct an unbiased
epigenome-wide search for DNA methylation biomarkers associated with PM2.5 and TRAP
exposure prenatally through age 12 years (n=500) and 2) identify unique and pollution-related
DNA methylation signatures associated with anxiety and depression. In addition, we will
replicate our findings in a third, independent birth cohort, Project Viva (n=652), with similar
sociodemographic characteristics and available air pollution and neurodevelopmental outcome
data. The study design, based on three well-established birth cohorts with nearly two
decades of follow-up, will allow for longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of air pollution,
DNA methylation, and mental health assessments all of which will increase the rigor and
generalizability of our study."
10833621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary afferent neurons in the cochlea, play vital functions in normal
hearing by transmitting auditory information from the mechanosensory hair cells to the brain, and in restoration
of hearing via cochlear implants in deaf individuals. However, exposure to traumatic and/or prolonged noise
causes degeneration and subsequent loss of SGNs and their synaptic connections with hair cells in varied
degrees, leading to degradation of auditory information, and impeding the performance of cochlear implants or
future hair cell or synapse regeneration strategies. The reasons for such SGN degeneration remain unclear. To
inform the development of novel therapies to preserve or regrow functional SGNs, it is critical to understand the
biological mechanisms of SGN degeneration and survival in the injured cochlea. We have recently identified
fractalkine signaling (CX3CL1-CX3CR1) between SGNs (which express chemokine CX3CL1 ligand) and innate-
immune cells such as macrophages and monocytes (which express cognate CX3CR1 receptor) as a key
neuroprotective signaling that promotes SGN survival and synapse repair in the injured cochlea. Here, we seek
to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which fractalkine signaling mediates neuroprotection in
mouse cochleae following graded noise trauma. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the precise roles of CX3CR1-
expressing cochlear resident and blood-derived recruited macrophages in SGN survival or degeneration after
noise trauma. Using fate mapping to distinguish and selectively deplete cochlear resident and recruited
macrophages, we will test the hypothesis that CX3CR1-expressing recruited macrophages promote SGN survival
after noise trauma. Aim 2 will determine whether CX3CR1 regulates macrophage responses after noise trauma
such that absence of CX3CR1 results in an increased and sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and reactive oxidative factors that is detrimental for SGN viability. Effector pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species will be detected in both cochleae and macrophages with intact
fractalkine signaling and those that lack CX3CR1 after noise trauma. Aim 3 will examine the relationship between
human CX3CR1 polymorphisms and noise-induced hearing loss. Approximately 25-30% humans carry two single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CX3CR1 locus (hCX3CR1-I249/M280) that show defective binding to
CX3CL1 ligand and loss of chemotactic function in macrophages. Using a novel humanized mouse model
expressing the aforementioned human CX3CR1 SNPs, we will test the hypothesis that dysregulated macrophage
responses due to impaired CX3CR1 signaling in these variants accelerates synapse and neuron loss and
worsens hearing following noise trauma. Together, these studies will test fundamentally new hypotheses
proposing specific elements of the innate immune system, macrophages and fractalkine signaling as critical
targets for neuroprotective immunotherapies to promote synapse repair and SGN survival in an injured cochlea."

laboratory between each trainee and the responsible faculty member(s), substantial didactic experiences, the
medical school and university environments, along with a series of structured activities foster interactions and
supplement training. Trainees audit semester courses at Harvard Medical School in their field of basic
science, while population science investigators obtain an MPH or a similar degree at the Harvard School of
Public Health. Postdoctoral trainees in a combined clinical and research training program join this program
after completing their clinical training. Graduate students join the program only after completing course work
and are in Harvard Ph.D Programs in Biomedical and Biological Sciences including (1) Immunology and 2)
Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics. The program is hosted in the Division of Rheumatology,
Immunology and Allergy at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Importantly, approximately 40% of faculty are part
of the program but located in other divisions, departments and Harvard Medical School affiliated Institutions
and are selected for their relevance to the program goals and their outstanding scientific and training expertise.
Besides Brigham and Women’s Hospital Departments of Medicine, Orthopedics and Neurology, they include
faculty at 1) the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 2) Boston Children’s Hospital, 3) Massachusetts General
Hospital, 4) Harvard Medical School Departments of Immunology, Biomedical Informatics, and Genetics, 5)
Harvard University Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative medicine, and 6) the Harvard School of Public
Health. The program goal is to provide an ongoing pipeline of highly trained and expert investigators
prepared for and focused in rheumatic and related musculoskeletal disease research."

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ancient cofactors composed of multiple iron and sulfur atoms. Owing to the rich,
tunable redox reactivity and selectivity of the cluster, Fe-S proteins play multifaced roles in redox control under
both physiological and stress conditions, which is required for maintaining normal cellular functions and cell
survival. Thus, Fe-S proteins are tightly linked to health and diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, and bacterial
infection) in humans. The parent Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA; R35 GM138157) project
addresses the critical gaps in structural and mechanistic understanding of Fe-S proteins in the cellular control of
redox homeostasis, including: i) the structural basis of redox reactivity and ligand selectivity in Fe-S clusters; ii)
the mechanism by which the redox state and integrity of the Fe-S cluster allows these proteins to sense redox
states and regulate transcription; iii) the structural biochemistry of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis and regulation; and
iv) the role of non-proteinaceous thiols in modulating Fe-S cluster-mediated redox control. The research goals
and approaches of the parent project are demonstrated in the three selected Fe-S protein-mediated mechanisms
for redox control and stress response in mycobacteria: i) redox sensing and transcriptional regulation by the
WhiB-like (Wbl) family proteins; ii) assembly, transfer, and repair of Fe-S clusters by the sulfur utilization factor
(SUF) system; and iii) mycothiol in Fe-S cluster homeostasis.
This diversity supplement request is to support the research training and career development of the pre-doctoral
candidate Daisy Guiza Beltran. Daisy’s long-term goal is to establish a research career in molecular mechanisms
of diseases. She has already gained skills in protein crystallography and protein biochemistry during her
undergraduate research and the first three years of her Ph.D. thesis research in the PI’s group. The proposed
research experience will expand Daisy’s expertise in structural biology and develop interdisciplinary skills in
biomedical sciences. The training activities will further enhance her leadership and communication abilities and
allow her to build a strong network of collaborations. The postdoctoral fellowship application will provide her with
an opportunity to further her research skills and career development. Additionally, her commitment to promoting
diversity and inclusion in the research environment will create a supportive and welcoming community for all,
which will help her become a successful and impactful researcher."

Copy number variations (CNVs) are a major cause of neurodevelopmental disorders, but their biological
investigation and pharmacological targeting pose many challenges. Deletions

and duplications at the 16p11.2
(ASD). However, alterations in the
corresponding protein networks, especially at key cellular sites for pathogenesis, have not been investigated in
this or other CNVs. We propose to use compartment-specific neuroproteomics, combined with bioinformatics,
super-resolution microscopy, and drug repurposing, to understand and alter dendritic excitability phenotypes
in 16p11.2 mouse and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. Based on our extensive preliminary data,
we hypothesize that altered expression of PRRT2, which likely regulates the trafficking of a subset of ion
channels and receptors, drives and abnormal complement of ion channels and receptor on the plasma
membrane, leading to abnormal excitability, excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, and network properties in
16p11.2 models and patients. These phenotypes may be reversed by targeting ion channel function using FDA-
approved anti-epileptic drugs or ERK signaling using repurposed cancer drugs. Our collaborative team, which
includes experts in neurodevelopmental disorders (Penzes), neuroproteomics (Savas), molecular pharmacology
(Barbolina), and ion channel physiology (George) will employ a powerful and multidisciplinary combination of
highly innovative methodologies to pursue the following Specific Aims: (1) To chart the developmental
regulation and determine molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal excitability in dup and del mice and
human neurons. (2) To chart the developmental profile and determine the molecular mechanisms underlying
the role of PRRT2 as a driver of excitability and seizure phenotypes. (3) Pharmacological reversal of 16p11.2 del
and dup phenotypes. This proposal will be the first to demonstrate that cellular subcompartment-specific
proteomics combined with super-resolution microscopy, informed by highly penetrant monogenic disease
genes within a CNV, can identify novel disease mechanisms. Such phenotypes could be reversed globally by
targeting network hubs using repurposed drugs, opening novel strategies for the treatment of
neurodevelopmental disorders."

 Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels transduce chemical signals to electrical signals in photoreceptors
and olfactory receptor cells and are essential for vision and smell. Mutations in CNG channel genes cause
retinitis pigmentosa and achromatopsia. CNG channels are activated cooperatively by intracellular cGMP or
cAMP. Although rich knowledge has been gained from extensive functional studies of CNG channels,
structural underpinnings of CNG channel properties and mechanisms are limited. Recently, closed- and open-
state cryo-EM structures of the homomeric C. elegans TAX-4 CNG channel and human CNGA1 channel have
been reported. These structures reveal many interesting and unique features that explain some CNG channel
properties. However, these structures do not faithfully represent native mammalian CNG channels, which are
heteroterameric complexes formed by CNGA1 and CNGB1 in rod photoreceptors and by CNGA3 and CNGB3
in cone photoreceptors. It is also unclear how disease-associated mutations (DAMs) alter CNG channel
structure and function. We have recently obtained a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the full-length human
CNGA3/CNGB3 channel in the apo closed state. The structure shows that the CNGA3/CNGB3 channel is
composed of 3 CNGA3 and 1 CNGB3, with an overall structure similar to that of TAX-4 and CNGA1, but
strikingly, R403 (located in the pore helix) and R442 (located at the cytoplasmic end of S6) of CNGB3 protrude
into the pore. We have also found that R410W, a DAM in CNGA3, opens the channel in the absence of cGMP.
Building on these advances, we propose three specific aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
allostery, cooperativity and channelopathy of CNGA3/CNGB3 and TAX-4 channels. (1) We will obtain high-
resolution structures of CNGA3/CNGB3 channels in closed and open states, in the absence and presence of
Ca2+. These structures are likely to shed light on the unique role of CNGB3 and on the fundamental question of
why native cone CNG channels have a CNGB3 subunit. (2) We will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
allosteric cGMP activation of CNGA3/CNGB3 and TAX-4 channels through functional and structural
characterization of partially liganded channels. Partial cGMP occupancy will be achieved by mixing CNGA3 or
CNGB3 with a mutant CNGB3 or CNGA3 subunit unable to bind cGMP, by concatenating CNGA3 and/or
CNGB3 into tandem-dimers that contain a subunit unable to bind cGMP, and by concatenating TAX-4 into
tandem-dimers and tandem-tetramers that contain varying numbers of WT TAX-4 and TAX-4_EA, a mutant
subunit incapable of binding cGMP. (3) We will investigate the molecular mechanisms of CNG channelopathy,
focusing on a systematic examination of the effect of DMAs in S4 and pore helix on the structure and function
of CNGA3/CNGB3 and TAX-4 channels. These studies will enhance our understanding of CNG channel ion
permeation, gating and channelopathy and provide guidance for the development of therapeutic strategies to
treat degenerative visual disorders."

Metastasis constitutes the primary cause of death for patients with cancer. Specific traits in advanced cancer,
including an altered metabolism and reprogramming of the translation machinery to establish selective
translation of specific mRNAs including regulators of cell metabolism, anti-apoptotic and pro-invasion factors,
leads to metastasis. Tumor cells under different physiological stresses such as hypoxia, nutritional deprivation,
and oxidative stress, inhibit global protein synthesis by downregulating canonical mRNA translation, but in
response, cancer cells utilize specialized mechanisms of protein synthesis to sustain their survival1-6. There is
little research to determine which metabolic mRNAs are translationally maintained or even upregulated following
stress, which needs to be elucidated. We propose to study the role of a non-canonical, cap-dependent mRNA
translation mechanism that functions during cell physiological stress when canonical mRNA translation is
inhibited, in the regulation of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), focused on cell metabolism critical for
metastasis. TNBC is one the most aggressive and highly metastatic subtypes and is associated with poor
prognosis7. A feature of TNBC models and patient tumors is dysregulated glycolysis, which is linked to
chemotherapeutic resistance8. In this application, we propose to continue our studies on two hallmarks of
invasive cancers, translational control, and metabolic reprogramming. The goal of this proposal is to delineate
the molecular mechanisms by which the selective mRNA translation by DAP5 regulated TNBC metabolism and
identify the pathways and metabolites that could ultimately be targeted to improved clinical outcomes in
advanced breast cancer. The central hypothesis is that DAP5 is critical in regulating the metabolism of TNBC
through selective translation of mRNA encoding metabolic regulators, particularly glucose metabolism and
calcium homeostasis, which affect metastasis, and this is favored under stress conditions, where canonical cap-
dependent translation is attenuated. The role of selective translation initiation in cancer metabolism is almost
completely unexplored and we propose an exciting and novel concept for understanding a non-canonical
mechanism mediated by DAP5 in the regulation of metastatic cancer cell metabolism. To this end, we will (1)
Identify the metabolic mRNAs translated by DAP5 that are maintained following oxidative stress and characterize
the metabolic functions of DAP5 in TNBC cells. (2) Determine the role of DAP5 in the metabolite identity of
tumors and metastasis in vivo. (3) Validate that increased expression of DAP5 is associated with metabolic
molecular biomarkers in available human primary tumor biopsies by comparing non-metastasized primary tumor
to primary tumors that gave rise to metastases in TNBC."
10846627,"The most common bacterial infections during pregnancy include urinary tract infections, cellulitis and skin
abscesses, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. Management of
bacterial infections in pregnant women requires early antimicrobial treatment to prevent adverse maternal and
pregnancy outcomes. As such, antibiotics are among the most commonly used medications in pregnancy –
approximately six out of ten publicly insured and four out of ten commercially insured pregnant women fill at
least one antibiotic prescription during pregnancy.
To select the optimal antibiotic from the range of available options for specific infections, it is therefore crucial
to understand the comparative safety of in utero exposure to specific antibiotics. Unfortunately, rigorous and
comprehensive safety data to inform the risk-benefit trade-off are sparse and evidence is conflicting. The
primary concern among potential risks associated with antibiotic use in pregnancy are congenital
malformations, which are a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and frequently cause lifelong
disability. Additionally, some studies have pointed to an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and neonatal
jaundice associated with some commonly used classes of antibiotics. Given that 45% of pregnancies in the US
are unintended, understanding the comparative safety of antibiotics in early pregnancy may also inform the
selection of antibiotics in women of reproductive age.
The objective of the proposed studies is therefore to evaluate the comparative safety of antibiotics commonly
used for the treatment of bacterial infections during pregnancy. To accomplish this, we will employ large
pregnancy cohorts of publicly and privately insured pregnant women (N ≈ 4.5 million). For each of the most
common bacterial infections, we will assess the comparative safety of available commonly used antibiotic
treatment options and utilize the rich information in our data sources to control for potential confounding
variables. The large study size will enable quantification of effects for the pre-specified outcomes (i.e.,
malformations overall, specific malformation types, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal jaundice) with great
precision. In addition, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the comparative safety, we will utilize a novel
signal detection method developed by members of our team, TreeScan, for simultaneous evaluation of a broad
range of potential maternal, fetal and neonatal adverse outcomes.
By harnessing the power of existing real-world data, this study will inform strategies for tailoring antibiotic
treatment to optimize pregnancy outcomes in this vulnerable population. As such, the proposed study aligns
well with the main goal of PAR-20-300. By defining the safest treatment options for women of reproductive age
with bacterial infections, the findings of this study will have direct and immediate clinical impact."

The global incidence of diabetes is rising. Gastroparesis is a significant complication of diabetes
that results in debilitating symptoms and affects quality of life. Current treatment options for
diabetic gastroparesis are limited. Significant visceral afferent neuropathy is associated with
diabetic gastroparesis and sympathetic overactivity is seen in nausea, both type 1 and 2 diabetes,
and diabetic complications. These dysfunctions can result from neuropathy affecting the thoracic
spinal nerves that carry both general visceral afferents and preganglionic sympathetic efferents
in the greater splanchnic nerve, innervating the foregut. Neuromodulation of the thoracic spinal
nerves should improve diabetic gastroparesis symptoms and restore quality of life by improving
neuropathy and gastric sensori-motor function. Our lab has developed and refined a novel, non-
invasive, neuromodulation treatment, Thoracic Spinal Nerve Magnetic Neuromodulation Therapy
(ThorS-MagNT). In our uncontrolled trial of adults with diabetic gastroparesis, ThorS-MagNT has
demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and improvement of DGp symptoms. Whether active
neuromodulation is better than sham therapy and the optimal frequency of treatment are not
known. We propose to conduct a dose-ranging, sham-controlled trial (pilot NIH Stage 1b) to
assess the effect of ThorS-MagNT on symptom severity and quality of life in diabetic
gastroparesis (TNM-DGp Trial). We will test the hypothesis that ThorS-MagNT will improve
visceral afferent neuropathy, autonomic and gastric dysfunction, compared to sham. We will also
test whether any improvements are due to neuromodulation of (a) peripheral spino-gut axis or (b)
central structures of the limbic system and autonomic network, or both. Successful completion of
this pilot study will provide insights into gastroparesis disease processes and inform mechanisms
of action of neuromodulation therapy in addressing disruption of the brain-gut axis. Our expected
outcomes include development of a novel, non-invasive, safe and efficacious therapy for diabetic
gastroparesis. These efforts will inform future true efficacy testing in an NIH Stage 2 trial using
multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) design."
10849732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world and risk for the disorder is especially high in offspring
of mothers with depression. Theorists have proposed that the way children process social-emotional information
may serve as an important mechanism of risk for the intergenerational transmission of depression. There is
growing evidence that children’s biased attention to facial displays of emotion – specifically, attentional
avoidance of sad faces – may represent a key mechanism of risk that develops early in life. Although there have
been some mixed findings, there is growing evidence across a number of studies that children of mothers with
a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) during the child’s life exhibit attentional avoidance of sad faces,
which has been proposed as an early emerging emotion regulation strategy. In contrast, there is clear evidence
that at-risk and depressed adolescents and adults exhibit difficulty disengaging attention from sad faces. It
appears, therefore, that the form and perhaps function of attentional bias shifts across development in at-risk
youth. To the extent that this is true, it has significant implications not only for theories of the intergenerational
transmission of depression risk but also for prevention and early intervention efforts designed to reduce this risk.
Primary Aim 1 of the proposed project is to the clarify the nature and trajectories of attentional biases in offspring
of mothers with MDD. We will complete a 2-year, multi-wave study of mothers with and without a history of MDD
and their children (aged 7-14 years old at the baseline assessment). At each assessment, we will use innovative,
multi-method measures of attentional biases incorporating eye-tracking and direct neural markers of attentional
allocation during computer-based tasks and actual mother-offspring interactions. This will allow us to chart
trajectories of change in attentional biases between the ages of 7 and 16 to test the hypothesis that they shift
from a pattern of attentional avoidance to pattern of difficulty disengaging attention from sad faces as children
age into adolescence. Primary Aim 2 is to examine the impact of these attentional biases on youths’ risk for
depression and whether this changes across development. Finally, because age-related changes in attentional
biases could represent a proxy for other developmental changes that occur during this period, a Secondary Aim
is to examine the extent to which changes in attentional bias are predicted by indices of pubertal development
(level, timing, tempo) as well as changes in cognitive processes (i.e., rumination) and interpersonal stress that
are known to occur during the transition to adolescence and that have been linked to attentional biases. In each
of these aims, we will also explore potential bidirectional relations, which could indicate vicious cycles of risk.
Finally, for each aim, we will evaluate specificity to maternal and child depression versus other forms of
psychopathology. This project will help to not only clarify a key mechanism of risk for the intergenerational
transmission of depression, but also highlight how interventions designed to target this risk factor may need to
be developmentally tuned to avoid exacerbating rather than mitigating risk."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common dementia syndrome in patients under age 65, while
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degeneration of motor neurons causing death
from respiratory failure within 3-5 years. FTD and ALS represent a spectrum of
neurodegeneration, with significant overlap clinically, pathologically, and genetically. Aggregates
of TDP-43 are the defining pathology of FTD (FTLD-TDP variant) and ALS, and the most common
genetic cause of both FTD and ALS are repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene. C9orf72 is
expressed in multiple cell types in the brain including in microglia and neurons, and there is strong
evidence that interaction between different cell types are necessary for pathogenesis of FTD/ALS.
We will develop a microphysiologic system (MPS) using human induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) derived cortical neurons, astrocytes and microglia on a 3D platform that includes a blood
brain barrier (BBB) component to model C9-FTD/ALS forebrain on a chip. Our goal in this project
is to develop a highly reproducible and translatable in vitro human cell-based model of FTD/ALS
to discover and validate translatable biomarkers for preclinical efficacy testing, and to assist in
patient stratification for clinical trial design. We propose to i) develop and validate robustness of
a 3D forebrain MPS incorporating cortical neurons and astrocytes, microglia and brain
microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) derived from human iPSCs; ii) utilize FTD and ALS
patient derived forebrain MPS's to identify disease biomarkers in C9orf72 related FTD/ALS; iii)
cross validate biomarkers identified using clinical data and pathology from C9-FTD/ALS patients
used to seed the chips, and iv) assess and stratify responses of C9-FTD/ALS fMPS models to
five different therapeutics entering early phase clinical trials ranging from antisense
oligonucleotides to small molecule modulators of mitochondrial function, endocytic trafficking and
cell death pathways."

Poor diet and chronic physical inactivity synergize with aging to induce physical decline and cognitive
dysfunction. As a result, there is a current push to test various diet and exercise modalities that can improve
metabolic health, preserve cognition, and expand health span. Both various forms of caloric restriction and
exercise have been shown to provide benefits for metabolism, cognition, and physical function. One popular
notion is that fuel oscillations alternating between carbohydrate and fat utilization are beneficial for long term
metabolic and cognitive health. A key corollary is that ketone metabolism, triggered by carbohydrate restriction
and fat catabolism, may mediate the observed benefits. Indeed, exploiting ketone body metabolism has garnered
recent attention as a tool to improve both peripheral metabolism and treat impaired cognition in aging individuals.
Rationale for ketone metabolism in brain health originates from the benefits of ketogenic diets or starvation for
seizure disorders. Due to the robust stimulation of adipose tissue lipolysis and increased fat oxidation in the liver,
exercise is another trigger for hepatic ketogenesis, raising the question of whether the beneficial relationship
between brain health and exercise could at least in part be transduced by ketone metabolism. Currently there
are large clinical trials testing if ketogenic diets can mitigate or treat cognitive decline and neurodegenerative
conditions associated with aging, however, studies investigating mechanisms of action are lacking. This proposal
will fill this void by leveraging novel genetic mouse models and cutting-edge approaches to test the central
hypothesis that nutritional and exercise-mediated oscillations of integrated ketone metabolism improve
neurometabolic health span. Studying mice with selective loss of either hepatic ketogenesis or neuronal ketone
oxidation will allow independent dissection of the mechanistic roles of integrated ketone metabolism in mediating
the well-described benefits of intermittent fasting (Aim 1) and exercise (Aim 2), which are both established
models that provoke ketosis and ketone utilization by the brain, while also improving metabolic and cognitive
phenotypes. The specific roles of ketone metabolism on caloric intake; body composition; whole-body energy
homeostasis, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and ketone turnover; cognitive function, including memory
and executive function; mitochondrial function in brain; metabolic flux (quantified using stable isotope tracers) in
brain; as well as the metabolome and transcriptome of discrete anatomic brain regions will all be quantified. Both
male and female mice will be examined in mid-life (12 months of age) after chronic Western diet feeding when
differences in health span will emerge via cognition, physical function, and metabolic phenotypes. By defining
the independent roles of both hepatic ketogenesis and neuronal ketone body oxidation in health span-promoting
interventions, the results will optimize therapies to be tested in future clinical trials. Moreover, this work will
elucidate specific therapeutic targets linking metabolism, cognition, and physical function in aging."

be to train the future national leaders in academic surgical oncology."
10830281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Germline cancer predispositions are well established for solid tumors. Once thought to be a rare event,
predispositions to myeloid malignancies are now included in the latest leukemia classification scheme from the
World Health Organization. Thus, more patients are expected to be recognized as carriers which can create a
constant fear of developing leukemia in their families. Given the best treatment is prevention, understanding the
important factors in transitioning from pre-malignant to overt disease stage is fundamental in establishing
guidelines for monitoring and treatment of such patients. Of many leukemia predisposition syndromes, we focus
on familial platelet disorders (FPD) caused by monoallelic RUNX1 germline mutations in. RUNX1-mutations in
FPD lead to bleeding disorders, lower counts and dysfunction of platelets. FPD is one of the most common forms
of inherited myeloid malignancies, and patients have ~40% life-long chance of developing leukemia at median
age of 33 years. The transition to overt leukemia is accompanied by acquisition of secondary mutations, though
the complete mechanism of disease transformationis unknown. Intriguingly, FPD patients manifest with different
allergies such as skin eczema, indicating the possible role of increased inflammation in driving leukemia
development. Therefore, we propose that inflammatory stress facilitates leukemia initiation and progression in
FPD. To test this, we performed series of experiments using primary FPD bone marrow cells. We observed that
FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs) show myeloid biased differentiation and increased colony
formation ability, while fall behind in megakaryocyte differentiation. Single cell transcriptome analysis of healthy
and FPD bone marrow cells confirmed the skewed differentiation of progenitors and identified enrichment of
inflammatory response pathways in FPD compared to healthy stem cells. Consistently, we found upregulation
of inflammatory cytokines in the bone marrow niche, including from mesenchymal stromal cells. Therefore, I
hypothesize that a cross-talk between RUNX1-mutations mediated changes in HSPCs and inflammatory
microenvironment promotes myeloid growth and differentiation defects in FPD stem and progenitor
cells. To address this hypothesis, in Aim 1, I will evaluate the impact of inflammatory stress on growth and
differentiation of FPD and healthy HSPCs. I will use the genetic or pharmacological inhibition approaches to
dissect the mechanism by which inflammatory stress impacts the functions of FPD HSPCs. Then, I will identify
whether these effects are directly regulated by RUNX1 using CUT&Tag experiments. In Aim 2, I will determine
the effect of RUNX1-mutated bone marrow stromal cells on the function of FPD and healthy HSPCs using newly
established 3D co-culture methods. Then, I will use a unique mouse model with germline Runx1-hetrozygous
mutation to determine the role of bone marrow niche on stem cell growth and differentiation defects. The
outcomes of this study will improve the existing knowledge of disease biology and contribute to my long-term
goal of identifying new targeted therapies for the treatment and even attenuating disease initiation."

This career development award will establish Dr. Kimberly Narain, MD, PhD, MPH, as an independent
investigator focused on evaluating the health, aging and healthcare costs implications of social, economic and
health policies/programs, among adults with low socioeconomic status (SES), using both quasi-experimental
and microsimulation approaches. This KO8 award will provide her the support she needs to develop expertise
in 3 areas 1) analysis of administrative claims and longitudinal data; 2) aging epidemiology and SES disparities
in aging; and 3) microsimulation and cost-benefit analysis. Non-adherence to medications and treatment
recommendations due to costs is an important driver of the SES gradient in health and disability among adults
with diabetes.1 Value Based Insurance Design (VBID) strategies that reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for
medications to treat diabetes and associated conditions (hyperlipidemia and hypertension) as well as disease
management appointments (primary care and endocrinologist visits) have been shown to improve medication
adherence and cardiovascular risk factor control, among privately insured individuals. However, little is known
about the effects of VBID among low income adults with Type 2 diabetes. 2,3 Understanding the effect of VBID
among low income adults is important because they face the highest disease burden associated with Type 2
diabetes and they may be particularly responsive to VBID given their higher level of price sensitivity, relative to
higher income individuals.4 However, they may also face barriers outside of costs such as low health literacy,
making the effects of VBID among this population uncertain. Additionally, it is important to know if there is any
heterogeneity in response to VBID, across baseline medication adherence levels, given that prior studies have
shown the largest effect magnitudes among subgroups with the lowest baseline medication adherence levels.
Lastly, the long-term impacts of VBID on the health, disability and healthcare costs of low income adults with
diabetes remains uninvestigated. Dr. Narain will clarify the impact of VBID among this population by examining
the impact of the Diabetes Health Plan (DHP), an employer-sponsored VBID, offered by Unitedhealthcare,
among low income (salaries < $30,000), adults with Type 2 diabetes. This project will leverage an existing data
set of more than 200 employers, housed at UCLA, to estimate both the short and long-term impacts of the
DHP, using quasi-experimental methods and a microsimulation modeling approach, respectively. The specific
aims of the proposed project are to 1) Estimate the impact of the DHP on (A) medication adherence, (B)
cardiovascular risk factors (HbA1c and LDL) and (C) healthcare utilization among low income adults with Type
2 diabetes; 2) Compare DHP treatment effects across baseline levels of medication adherence and 3)
Estimate the long-term impact of the DHP, relative to standard health insurance plans, on disability-free life
expectancy and healthcare costs among aging low income adults with Type 2 diabetes. The project will provide
key insight for informing health insurance benefit design and improving health equity."

Bacterial diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continue to be a major worldwide cause of human morbidity
and mortality. Among various enteric pathogens, Shigella spp. are some of the most common and deadly
bacterial pathogens. They are responsible for ~125 million worldwide cases of shigellosis and ~14,000 deaths
annually, the majority in children under the age of 5 and occurring in developing countries [1-3]. Preventing and
treating shigellosis with conventional tools (e.g., vaccines and antibiotics) has proven to be very difficult, and
the increasing prevalence of multi-antibiotic-resistant Shigella strains [4-7] creates the alarming possibility that
these already staggering morbidity and mortality rates may further increase. The CDC [6] and WHO [7] have
recently emphasized the threat of antibiotic resistant Shigella, and is underscored further by the increasing
prevalence of antibiotic resistant Shigella in food [4], occurrence through sexual transmission [5] and unusually
large outbreaks [8]. Therefore, alternative approaches for reducing the incidence and severity of Shigella
infections are urgently needed. Ideally, these approaches will be affordable, so that they can be widely
distributed in developing countries where resources are scarce and Shigella infections are a significant public
health concern. They also should be non-antibiotic-based, so their continued use will not promote the
emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Shigella or other enteric pathogens. We believe that
bacteriophages offer one such approach. Lytic bacteriophages present a platform technology which can be
used to develop a series of products for the treatment of various infectious diseases of bacterial etiology. In
developing this platform technology for human clinical applications and integrating it into modern medical
practices, we focus here on evaluating the safety and efficacy of our Shigella phage preparation (ShigActive™)
in Phase 1/2a human clinical trials. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) manufacture the ShigActive™ clinical
trial material; 2) set the regulatory framework for concurrence and approval by regulatory entities; and 3)
perform an FDA-approved proof-of-concept Phase 1 safety and Phase 2a efficacy trial using a controlled
human infection model of shigellosis. This study will also generate novel, preliminary microbiome data of
bacteriophage interaction with normal gut microbiota. This will be the first clinical trial of a bacteriophage
preparation for managing Shigella infections conducted under FDA guidelines. If successful, our studies here
will provide an innovative, safe, and effective approach for managing Shigella infections. Moreover, they also
will provide critical groundwork for developing additional phage preparations against other bacterial pathogens
of concern, including Vibrio cholerae, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, and other important bacterial agents of GI
tract disease."

The neuromodulator dopamine is critical for motivating, performing, and reinforcing goal-directed behaviors, and
deficits in dopamine signaling are common in neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, addiction and Parkinson’s disease. Central to our understanding of dopamine function is the notion
that phasic increases and decreases in extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum modulate striatal output to
modify behavior on short and long timescales. For instance, phasic elevations in striatal dopamine elicited by
salient stimuli and reward-predicting cues have been proposed to promote arousal, facilitate action initiation and
increase motivation to work on timescales of seconds to minutes, but also to modify future actions and behavioral
decisions on longer timescales extending to days. This raises a fundamental question: How does dopamine
modulate the activity of striatal neurons to exert its influence on behavior? Experiments in vitro have
revealed a myriad of molecular targets sensitive to modulation by dopamine. However, the net effects of these
changes on striatal output in vivo remain unknown. One reason is that few methods are capable of dissecting
dopamine’s cell type-specific neuromodulatory effects on synaptic strength, somatic excitability and network
dynamics in the awake, behaving brain. This proposal aims to fill this gap in knowledge using in vivo whole-cell
electrophysiology and two-photon microscopy, focusing initially on the neuromodulatory effects occurring on
timescales of seconds to minutes. Informed by our published and preliminary data with these techniques, we
will test the hypothesis that phasic dopamine transients reflecting positive and negative reward
prediction errors promote the activation of striatal projection neurons expressing D1- and D2-type
dopamine receptors (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs), respectively, via a combination of intrinsic and synaptic
short-term plasticity mechanisms. To do so, we will harness our ability to record sub-threshold membrane
potential dynamics in vivo to reveal how behaviorally- and optogenetically-evoked dopamine transients alter the
intrinsic excitability of D1- and D2-SPNs (Aim 1) and the potency of excitatory synapses impinging on them (Aim
2). In Aim 3, we will employ calcium imaging to uncover the short-term influence of phasic dopamine transients
on striatal output. Together, our experiments will provide crucial mechanistic insights into the modulatory actions
of dopamine in vivo, shedding light on a key link between dopamine release and behavioral modifications, and
paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at treating neuropsychiatric disorders."
10830482,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Actomyosin stress fibers (SFs) enable cells to tense the extracellular matrix (ECM), a process key to cell shape
determination, motility, and morphogenesis. Over the past 15+ years, including the past period of R01
support, we have made significant contributions to the field’s understanding of SF mechanics and contributions
to cell structure. Our work is particularly notable for the use of femtosecond laser nanosurgery (FLN), which
has enabled us to show that the three canonical SF subtypes – dorsal fibers, transverse arcs, and ventral
fibers – collectively enforce a front-back tension gradient that underlies two-dimensional (2D) mesenchymal
migration. We also showed that the SF network architecture can mechanically reinforce individual SFs, which
has significant implications for symmetry breakage during directed migration and force propagation through cell
monolayers. With this intellectual foundation in place, our renewal application turns to two important
questions: How is polarization of tension in the SF network encoded by molecular signals classically
understood to establish front-back polarity? And how does our knowledge of 2D SF networks translate to
confined migration geometries like those found in tissue? We will address these questions through two
specific aims, both of which build upon publications from this award. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate
mechanistic contributions of cofilin-1 to establishment and maintenance of SF front-back tension polarization
during migration. We hypothesize that cofilin-1 establishes front-back polarization of SF tension by promoting
the assembly and contractile maturation of transverse arcs. By combining biophysical, engineering, and cell
biological tools, we will identify key molecular and force-based signals that modulate recruitment of cofilin-1 to
developing transverse arcs. In an innovative new collaboration with Dr. Bruce Goode (Brandeis) we will
reconstitute actin bundles in microfluidic devices and quantify the relationship between tensile force and cofilin-
1 engagement. In Specific Aim 2, we will dissect contributions of SF networks to migration in confined
geometries where the ECM imposes axial cues and sterically precludes elaboration of 2D SF networks. We
hypothesize that increasing confinement redirects SF assembly from the 2D dorsal fiber-transverse arc-ventral
fiber assembly pathway towards de novo parallelized SF assembly. We will combine microengineered culture
platforms, single-cell mechanical tools, and superresolution imaging to probe confinement-induced changes in
SF assembly, architecture, and mechanics. Aim 2 will leverage two established, productive collaborations:
With Dr. Ulrich Schwarz (U. Heidelberg), we will develop multiscale computational models that relate SF
network architecture and mechanics to cell migration in confined spaces. With neurosurgeon Dr. Manish Aghi
(UCSF), we will test the clinical value of our observations by asking if confined migration of glioblastoma stem
cells is retrospectively predictive of in vivo invasion patterns. Our studies will create unprecedented new insight
into how SFs contribute to migration, with innovative methodology and close connection to human disease."
10830977,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
We propose a novel virtual reality intervention to test for efficacy on reducing stimulant use and increasing
abstinence, with concomitant increases in future self-identification, future time perspective, and delay-of-
reward, in early recovering stimulant use disorder (StUD) persons. Impaired future orientation and delay-of-
reward appear to be behavioral endophenotypes for substance use disorders. With recovery attempts usually
failing within 6 months of treatment, there is considerable room for improved efficacy. Converging evidence
indicates that a hallmark of StUD is impaired visualizing and planning for the future, which corresponds to
greater devaluation of delayed rewards. Our preliminary tests of the intervention were promising, with n=14 out
of n=18 participants remaining abstinent 30 days later; importantly, 10 of the 14 abstainers showed a positive
response to the intervention, suggesting an efficacy marker. The intervention increases future self-identification
and delay-of-reward in people recovering from substance use disorder, and engages brain networks governing
prospection; further, the VR effect on delay-of-reward correlated with introspective-executive brain connectivity.
Extending prior work on episodic future thinking, we employed a precision medicine approach in designing a
personalized immersive virtual experience that integrates personal details and maximizes sensory
engagement. Our intervention increases connectedness with one’s future by immersing subjects in a realistic
portrayal of interacting with their Future Selves in divergent futures. Importantly, we integrate self-discrepancy
theory, focusing on the gap between “what is” and “what could be” to heighten motivation, and we promote
engagement by maximizing the novelty and emotional salience of the experience. Early-recovering StUD
persons enter a realistic virtual world, are introduced to a time travel narrative, and interact with two digitally
age-progressed Future Selves; one after 15 years of ongoing stimulant abuse, and the other after 15 years of
recovery. Both Future Selves speak to the participant about their recovery rewards, or losses from returning to
habitual drug use, and personal struggles during the journey. Strong emphasis is placed on agency, optimism,
and decision-making. After iterative development and tests of feasibility and safety, the paradigm yielded a
promising efficacy signal, behavioral change, and brain target engagement. The current proposal will validate
this paradigm in an expanded sample to show efficacy and behavioral mechanisms using the same VR
paradigm. Aim 1 will test for efficacy on stimulant and drug use outcomes (amount, frequency, type, relapse,
and abstinence) with longitudinal assessments at 1 and 6 months. Aim 2 will determine mechanisms by testing
for changes in future self-identification, future time perspective, and behavioral delay discounting. The long-
term goal of the project is to validate a potent adjunctive intervention with long-term recovery benefits that is
readily implemented during post-treatment aftercare or in a treatment setting."
10830978,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The endogenous circadian clock that synchronizes cellular physiology with the earth's light/dark cycle affects
all aspects of physiology – from molecular to cellular to behavioral. The circadian system has an integral role in
promoting cellular resilience in the face of environmental or internal perturbation. Circadian disruption has been
linked with cardiovascular disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting
the importance of fundamental knowledge of cellular clock mechanisms for clinical medicine. While the
molecular basis for circadian timekeeping has been exquisitely defined, how the clock responds to the
environment to maintain cellular homeostasis remains mostly unknown.
 We will test the hypothesis that the core circadian clock protein CLOCK is a stress sensor that
transmits environmental information through structural elements in its intrinsically disordered region to both the
circadian timekeeping mechanism and the stress-response machinery. We have discovered that the RNA
chaperone DDX3X critically regulates the sensitivity of CLOCK to environmental stimuli such as temperature
and has potent effects on both circadian timekeeping and cellular resilience. We will determine how CLOCK
mechanistically integrates with the cellular stress machinery, including the heat shock response. Beyond its
role as a stress sensor, we will investigate how the circadian system and CLOCK adaptively organize the
biochemical state of the proteome, sculpting the circadian assembly of biological pathways involved in
homeostasis. We will test these cellular data in animals by measuring how genetic and behavioral models of
circadian disruption and sleep deprivation re-program the rhythmicity of protein assemblies. Finally, we will
apply these discoveries to human peripheral blood samples in which we have, for the first time, identified
rhythms of protein synthesis. This proposal is strengthened by its multi-scaled and interdisciplinary approaches
that harness the expertise of the PI in chronobiology, cell biology, and biochemistry in collaboration with
experts in human circadian biology (Klerman), proteomics and phosphoproteomics (Asara), live cell and
super-resolution imaging (Chen), and imaging and assay development (Barrett).
 Our hypothesis is that the molecular mechanisms for circadian resilience and their failure during stress
underlie a maladaptive feedback loop that connects integrated cellular stress responses with circadian
misalignment. Determining the mechanisms by which the circadian clock supervises, senses, and responds to
environmental stimuli is a crucial challenge for linking circadian disruption to disease mechanisms. My clinical
background and experience as a pediatric neurologist trained in sleep medicine supports and informs my
research interest in sleep and circadian disorders. We anticipate that the successful testing of this hypothesis
will offer novel and pharmacologically actionable targets for mitigating the bivalent link between circadian
misalignment and the many human disorders associated with it.

10830980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer sequencing projects have identified a very large number of DNA mutations whose importance in cancer
is not yet understood. To better understand the impact of these mutations, our team has produced a software
tool for computational analysis of cancer mutations that can analyze millions of mutations at one time. This tool
works as a funnel to help researchers to find the small number of mutations that are most likely to be informative
from the very large number of mutations discovered in a sequencing project. The software allows users to design
ways to combine multiple mutation evaluation metrics, and generate a prioritized list of mutations that are more
likely to be biologically important. These evaluation metrics include the molecular consequence, bioinformatic
scores to identify pathogenic and driver mutations, frequency of the mutation in human populations, previous
occurrence in tumor tissue types, pointers to literature, and visualization of annotated protein structures and
networks. A web-based version of the pipeline - Cancer Related Analysis of Variants Toolkit (CRAVAT) has been
widely adopted (3000+ jobs submitted/month on average in 2020). We have attracted a user community that
spans both basic and clinical cancer researchers, all of whom rely on high-throughput tumor sequencing in their
work. In 2019, we introduced OpenCRAVAT, which is distinguished by an open source codebase and an open
app store of tools and resources that can be used to better understand the importance and impact of mutations.
The app store is driven by the user community; new apps are prioritized based upon user requests and the app
store includes many apps that were contributed directly by outside tool developers. The app store currently
aggregates tools from over 70 organizations, and these tools can be combined to identify mutations whose
molecular impact contributes to tumorigenesis, prognosis and treatment selection. Initial adoption of our
OpenCRAVAT tool is encouraging, with over 10,000 local package downloads in the first two years. We expect
that OpenCRAVAT will be adopted by a much larger community, given the increasing importance of DNA
sequencing data in cancer research. We will continue to ensure that our tools are interoperable with other
informatics tools and services, and can be run in different computational environments such as cloud computing
and local installation to maintain data privacy."
10831100,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Incident epilepsy is more common in the elderly than at any other time of life. While some cases are due to
stroke or known Alzheimer’s disease (AD), many cases have no known etiology. This proposal hypothesizes
that late-onset epilepsy (LOE; epilepsy starting at age 60 or later, in the absence of stroke or other identified
cause) is associated with cognitive decline and preexisting neuropathology such as amyloid deposition; i.e.,
LOE may be a marker for future cognitive impairment and dementia. The research will use data from the
ongoing longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort study (Aims 1 and 2), as well as from
a new cohort recruited as part of this grant (Aims 3 and 4). The specific aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that
late-onset epilepsy (LOE) is associated with cognitive decline, and the subsequent development of MCI or
dementia. 2) To test whether Aβ 42/40 ratio is associated with LOE. 3) To determine whether individuals with
clinically-identified LOE have lower cognitive scores than individuals without LOE. 4) (Exploratory) To compare
AD biomarkers in patients with and without LOE, and correlate subclinical epileptiform activity with cognitive
performance in patients with LOE. Defining whether there is an association of LOE with an elevated risk of
future cognitive impairment could allow patients to have earlier interventions, which may help slow future
cognitive decline. This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award
(K23). The overarching training goal of the proposed project is to provide the candidate with the skills
necessary to become an independent researcher in epilepsy related to aging. Specific training goals are to
obtain advanced training in epidemiology and biostatistics; to obtain training in recruiting and leading cohort
studies; to acquire and apply knowledge of AD pathophysiology and the use of biomarkers; to gain didactic and
experiential training in cognitive assessments in neurodegenerative diseases; and to advance professional
development skills in preparing manuscripts and presenting at conferences. The career development plan
includes classes in biostatistics and epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health; regular
meetings with mentors; seminars in biostatistics and the epidemiology of aging; seminars in AD
pathophysiology and research; and attending/presenting at national conferences. The candidate’s primary
appointment is in the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurology, an extremely supportive environment with a
strong history of junior investigators successfully transitioning to independent investigators."
10831101,"Abstract
 Brain arteriolosclerosis (B-ASC) is a cerebrovascular disease characterized by pathological thickening of
the arterioles in the brain. Non-Alzheimer’s disease brain pathologies, including B-ASC, are increasingly
recognized as important contributors to cognitive decline in aged individuals. In autopsy cohorts, B-ASC is
found in over 50% of participants aged eighty years or older at death. B-ASC is associated with multiple other
neuropathologies, including hippocampal sclerosis. Despite its clinical importance, the pathophysiology of brain
arteriolosclerosis and its mechanistic relationship to other pathologies are not well understood. We have
aggregated and harmonized genotype and autopsy data between four high-quality neuropathology cohorts: the
National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging
Project (ROSMAP), the Adult Changes in Thought Study (ACT), and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative Neuropathology Cohort (ADNI). In preliminary genetic association and functional genomic studies
using NACC participants, we identified multiple B-ASC risk loci that replicated in at least one independent
cohort and established a framework for genetic studies of neuropathological endophenotypes (NPE). In Aim 1,
we hypothesize that analyses employing gene expression and DNA methylation will further characterize
genomic risk factors for B-ASC pathology. We will investigate the relationship between B-ASC, gene
expression, and DNA methylation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using ROSMAP. These analyses will be
followed by computational approaches that will estimate the contribution of different cell types and predict gene
expression from genotype data in other cohorts. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that B-ASC shares genomic risk with
associated NPE. We will first use our established analytic pipeline to perform genetic association studies of
NPE comorbid with B-ASC. We will then use statistical methods to quantify and localize shared genetic risk
between B-ASC and other NPE. Findings from these studies will provide a rigorous characterization of B-ASC
risk factors and relevant biological pathways. Our cross-trait analyses will help clarify B-ASC’s place in the
complex web of mixed brain pathologies common in aged individuals. The mentors and collaborators I have
recruited comprise an experienced and multidisciplinary team that includes two biostatisticians, a genetic
epidemiologist, and an experimental neuropathologist. This NIH F30 fellowship will provide the requisite
experience, knowledge, and skills necessary as preparation to the next stage in my career as a clinical
researcher."

The candidate is a tenure-track assistant professor at James Madison University, with the overarching goal of
understanding the development of the structure and function of the cerebral cortex to better diagnose and treat
neurodevelopmental disorders. His long-term research objective is to clarify the developmental and cell-
specific roles of integrins in the brain, and the overall focus of his proposal is to advance this objective by
understanding the developmental, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral roles of integrin beta 3 (Itgb3) in
excitatory cortical circuitry in vivo. His professional goals are to establish research independence and create a
network of outstanding colleagues. Achieving these goals will also strengthen his research program in a
NINDS-relevant area to compete successfully for R01/R15 funding by year 3 of the award and achieve tenure. A
team of outstanding, NIH-funded mentors will guide the candidate toward the stated goals. The primary
mentor is Dr. Mark Gabriele (James Madison Univ.), an expert in developmental neurobiology. The three co-
mentors are neuroscientists Dr. Jonathan Kipnis (UVA), an expert in autism and neuroimmunology, Dr.
Patricia Maness (UNC), an expert in cell adhesion molecules associated with neurodevelopmental disorders,
and Dr. Gregorio Valdez (Virginia Tech), a recent NINDS K01 awardee who has since secured an R01 and
tenure. The candidate has the full support of his colleagues (Career Advisory Committee) and institution.
 The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the developmental role of Itgb3 in excitatory
cortical circuitry in vivo and establish a framework linking the anatomical, physiological, and behavioral
consequences of Itgb3 loss of function. The central hypothesis is that Itgb3 is required during a critical period
for restricting dendritic development in pyramidal neurons, establishing a normal excitatory tone required in
prefrontal cortex for normal social behavior. Preliminary data support this hypothesis, which will be tested by
pursuing 3 aims: (Aim 1) Determine if Itgb3 mediates dendritic development within excitatory cortical
pyramidal neurons, establishing a neural substrate for normal social behavior in prefrontal cortex. (Aim 2)
Define a critical period for Itgb3 function in excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex. (Aim 3)
Define synaptic functions of Itgb3 in excitatory cortical pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex. This
contribution is significant because it will be the first to provide a mechanism for in vivo neuronal function of
integrin beta 3. The research is innovative because it shifts current research toward the neuron- and cortex-
specific functions of Itgb3 by causing cell-type-specific loss of function of Itgb3 in vivo during development.
 Taken together, the candidate has the full support of his mentors and institution as he executes a
research and career plan that will lead him toward his goals of uncovering a role for integrin beta 3 in cortical
development, and of establishing an active research program that will uncover fundamental knowledge about
the brain and nervous system to reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism."

10839884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People living with HIV (PLWH) are aging and have increased risk for age-associated health complications such
as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and low bone mineral density. Both CVD and decreased bone mineral
density accelerate frailty, which is a complex of geriatric conditions underlying biological vulnerability and
decreased physiological competence that results in multiple adverse outcomes. Inflammation plays a critical
role in these ageassociated phenotypes. Identification of novel surrogate inflammatory biomarkers with
inherent potential as disease causative agents not only enhances risk stratification in the aging HIV+
populating but also offers important cues for novel therapeutic strategies. IL-32 is a multi-isoform
proinflammatory cytokine that we showed to be linked with CVD and aging in HIV infection and is negatively
regulated by the gut short chain fatty acid caproic acid. IL-32 is also involved in mechanisms governing bone
metabolism, mechanisms that are potentially involved in atherosclerosis. Here, we hypothesize that in HIV
infection, IL-32 is involved in Premature Aging Phenotypes (PAP) that are manifested by CVD, altered body
composition (low bone mineral density and abnormal fat deposition) and frailty. To validate this hypothesis, our
current applications proposes an approach combining in vivo cardiovascular imaging, ex vivo measures of IL-
32 from PLWH for whom frailty and body composition data are available, and in vitro studies intending to
investigate the mechanistic link between IL-32 expression and PAP. In Aim 1, we will study the expression of
IL-32 isoforms in peripheral blood in PLWH in two large cohorts of men and women; the Canadian HIV and
Aging Cohort Study (CHACS) and the Women's Interagency HIV Cohort Study (WIHS), now combined with the
Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) in the MWCCS cohort, respectively. We will evaluate the potential of
IL-32 isoforms in predicting PAP in these two cohorts using two types of analysis; a binary analysis
(presence/absence of CVD, frailty and osteoporosis) and joint occurrence of the adverse phenotypes. In Aim 2,
we will investigate the mechanisms by which caproic acid regulates IL-32 expression in 3 major cell types;
intestinal epithelial cells (as a primary cell types expected to be exposed to caproic acid in gut), CD4 T cells
(major cells producing IL-32 and main reservoir for latent HIV under ART) and primary vascular endothelial
cells, the dysfunction of which results in frank atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we further propose to dissect the
mechanism(s) by which the CVD-associated IL-32 isoforms impact the process of osteoclastogenesis
(differentiation of osteoclast cells involved in bone resorption, lower mineral bone density and potentially the
development of noncalcified atherosclerotic lesions). Together, the overarching goal of this project is to
demonstrate that IL-32 is a central player in systemic inflammation and an accelerator of multiple aging
phenotypes (CVD, frailty and osteoporosis) and that this cytokine can be used as a predictive biomarker for
PAP and also as a therapeutic target."
10839886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Louisiana exemplifies the disparity between HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) need and uptake in the
South, ranking 4th among US states in HIV incidence in 2018 while ranking 46th in PrEP uptake the following
year. To date, few solutions have emerged to address barriers to optimal PrEP utilization in Louisiana and the
South overall. Our team has previously demonstrated proof-of-concept of the utility of electronic health record
(EHR)-based machine learning (ML) algorithms for identifying incident HIV cases (surrogate for PrEP
candidates) within healthcare systems, outperforming current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) PrEP indication guidelines. This promising methodology has never been implemented in a Southern
healthcare system, and the best approach for incorporating health system-based EHR risk prediction models
into community HIV prevention efforts is unclear. The proposed project seeks to evaluate two novel
approaches to expanding EHR-based model implementation beyond their originating health systems and into
the communities they serve: 1) an asynchronous strategy involving study team and local community-based
personnel notifying community members at risk of HIV infection using a monthly report generated by the EHR
risk model 2) a real-time strategy using best practice advisories to alert ED and UC providers of persons
flagged as increased risk for HIV by the model during acute care encounters. We will test these strategies
within two healthcare systems in Southeastern Louisiana: LCMC Health in New Orleans and Our Lady of the
Lake Health in Baton Rouge. To capture a high HIV risk population, the study will focus on persons in the
health system who exclusively engage the health system through emergency department (ED) and urgent care
(UC) encounters. The project’s specific aims are to: 1) Derive and validate an EHR-based HIV risk prediction
model utilizing clinical data from ED and UC encounters in two Southeastern Louisiana health systems. 2)
Develop stakeholder-informed implementation strategies for extending the reach of the EHR-based prediction
model beyond the health system. 3) Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of two community-facing
implementation approaches to EHR HIV risk prediction model deployment. Aim 1 will adapt our EHR-based
risk prediction model into the local HIV epidemiologic context. Aim 2 will obtain key stakeholder input to guide
the development of culturally-responsive strategies for risk status notification of at-risk individuals identified by
the model. Aim 3 will feature a pilot implementation trial to assess the two implementation strategies: To
execute these objectives, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in HIV health services
research, HIV prevention epidemiology, health informatics and implementation science. This team will partner
with key community-based organizations (Camp ACE of the St. John 5 Missionary Baptist Church in New
Orleans and Metro Health of Baton Rouge), to leverage the power and reach of health system EHR towards
empowering community members with the data they need to make informed decisions about using PrEP."
10846808,"Abstract: Photolithographic Tumor DNA Isolation
 Personalized oncology is based on the idea that the mutations in a cancer determine optimal therapy.
Mutation detection is increasingly possible with newer next generation sequencers and bioinformatics, but
currently the first step of DNA isolation is ad hoc, manual, and non-standardized. Human tumors are complex
mixtures of normal and tumor cells, and mutation detection would become more reliable and reproducible if
nearly pure tumor DNA was extracted. Here we propose to develop an automated system that can extract
>90% pure tumor DNA from conventional H&E stained microscope slides by integrating photolithography with
high resolution slide scanners, image analysis algorithms, and modern 3D printers. Machine learning image
algorithms can distinguish tumor from normal cells, and this information will be transferred to the 3D printer,
which places opaque material directly over tumor nuclei on the slide. The slide is then exposed to short wave
UV light to destroy the DNA in unprotected normal cells whereas tumor DNA is selectively protected by the
photolithographic mask. DNA can be extracted from the entire slide, and only DNA in the protected tumor cells
can be sequenced (whole exome or targeted sequencing) or measured for CpG methylation. The spot
resolution of the 3D printer is about 40 microns, and therefore very irregular complex topography and small
features like a single tumor gland can be protected by photolithography. The entire system (scan, analyze,
print, irradiate, extract) could yield >90% pure tumor DNA from an H&E slide in about 24 hours.
 The transformational potential is that the system converts a currently ad hoc, highly labor-intensive
technical step into an automated, well-documented and reproducible extraction that can add information and
learning because the exact extracted cell numbers, their phenotypes and spatial locations are known. Because
it uses an image algorithm to select the tumor cells, the “same” DNA isolation can be performed by anyone
anywhere in the world. Moreover, image algorithms can “learn” to better extract tumor DNA based on feedback
from the DNA sequencing. The integration of this system into a sequencing pipeline would improve the
reliability, documentation, and reproducibility of mutation calling by extracting nearly pure (>90%) tumor DNA,
which will advance both reproducible cancer research and the clinical translation of precision oncology."
10846809,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A functional multicellular organism consists of various cell types that arise from a single cell. This fascinating
process involves changes in spatio-temporal gene activity and genome organization. Disruptions in
chromosomal interactions and gene expression can lead to developmental disorders or cancer. Despite the
remarkable emerging views on multi-scale genome architecture and gene regulation, our knowledge is still very
limited on how maternal and paternal genomes are accommodated in each cell to achieve diverse cellular
identities. Moreover, it remains poorly understood how structural heterozygosity between parents may impact
genome structure and function to tip over cell state from normal to dysfunctional. Challenges in distinction
between homologous chromosomes, especially at single cell resolution, have hampered our ability to ask
pressing questions about variability and heterogeneity of parental genomes and related functional significance.
Our previous work involved the development of complementary approaches including haplotype-specific omics
and transformative single-cell imaging to distinguish homologs. Our goal is to leverage these powerful
approaches to determine how packaging and functional regulation of diploid genomes are formed and
maintained, and how disrupted genome integrity affects cell fate. Specifically, we will determine how parental
contribution influences intricate early genome packing and regulation. Furthermore, we will investigate plasticity
in establishment and maintenance of single-cell identities within tissues. Finally, we will uncover how
heterozygosity in parental content including transposons affects genome integrity, and thereby increase our
understanding of parental genome compatibility and organismal viability. Together, these proposed studies will
provide an enhanced framework for our foundational understanding of parental chromosome folding and
regulation to better interpret contribution of dysfunctional chromosomes to disease."
10846811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During an asthma exacerbation, the debilitating symptoms of breathlessness is largely driven by airway smooth
muscle (ASM) contraction. To relax the ASM, current therapies are directed either at antagonizing pro-contractile
ASM receptors (e.g. muscarinic antagonists, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists), or activating pro-
relaxant ASM receptors (e.g. 2-agonists). Despite their widespread use, these therapies remain inadequate in
controlling symptoms. Rather than targeting receptor-mediated pathways that are complex, indirect, and
susceptible to desensitization, our key premise is that a more robust strategy for treating asthma is to directly
target the ASM contractile apparatus. To disrupt the ASM contractile apparatus, we have discovered a
compelling action for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, ‘statins’, in the
mevalonate (MA) pathway. First, using human ASM cells and human precision cut lung slices (PCLS), we
observed that statins inhibit basal-, histamine-, and methacholine (MCh)-induced ASM contraction according to
their physiochemical properties (i.e. lipophilic versus hydrophilic statins), and the most pronounced effect is
conferred by the lipophilic statin, pitavastatin. Second, we observed that the ASM-relaxing effects of pitavastatin
occurs by inhibiting Rho kinase (ROCK)-1 activity, myosin light chain (MLC)-2 phosphorylation, and F-actin
stress fibers, by a MA- and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP)-dependent mechanism. Third, pitavastatins’
effect is additive to 2−agonists. Fourth, independent of its ASM-relaxing effect, pitavastatin also inhibits ASM
proliferation, and IL13-induced eotaxin-3 and IL17/TNF-induced IL6 and IL8 production by a MA/GGPP-
dependent mechanism. Finally, in a non-inflammatory mouse model of MCh-induced airway hyper-
responsiveness (AHR), intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of pitavastatin inhibited bronchoconstriction by 48%.
Empowered by these findings, we hypothesize that pitavastatin when delivered intratracheally can provide
optimal therapy for bronchoconstriction by ameliorating ASM contraction and ASM inflammation.
AIM 1: Establish the potential of pitavastatin to inhibit ASM contraction and bronchoconstriction.
AIM 2: Determine pitavastatin’s mechanisms for inhibiting ASM contraction and inflammation.
AIM 3: Examine the effects of asthma pathobiology on the efficacy of pitavastatin therapy.
Long-Term Impact: By inhibiting two key hallmark features of ASM dysfunction in asthma – contraction and
inflammation – inhaled pitavastatin may be superior to or enhance current inhaled bronchodilator therapies for
the treatment of asthma."

 Serious bacterial infections including infective endocarditis and skin and soft tissue infections are
among the most common medical complications in persons who inject drugs (PWID). Hospitalizations for
injection-related infective endocarditis increased twelve-fold between 2010 and 2015 and for heroin-related
skin and soft tissue infections doubled over the last two decades. Costs of these diseases have also increased
dramatically.
 While there are ongoing hospital-based programs to reduce injection-related bacterial infections, their
long-term effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness are unknown. Longitudinal investigation of these
interventions is urgently needed to improve outcomes given the rapid expansion of the US opioid epidemic, but
is challenging due to the relapsing nature of OUD, the heterogeneous nature of persons who inject opioids,
and the shifting nature of the drug supply. Simulation modeling can augment evidence from trials by projecting
the clinical and economic outcomes over longer time horizons for different populations. This proposed research
will use simulation modeling to examine the impact of changes in injection opioid use practices as well as
hospital-based interventions aimed at addressing the underlying OUD on the incidence of injection-related
bacterial infections with the following scientific aims:
Aim 1: To develop a simulation model of injection opioid use to project long-term incidence, outcomes, and
costs of injection-related infective endocarditis, skin and soft tissue infections, and overdose. Aim 2: To
estimate the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-initiated addiction care and rapid-access
linkage to post-hospital medication treatment for persons who inject opioids. Aim 3: To perform a
comprehensive economic evaluation alongside an ongoing clinical trial and to use the simulation model to
estimate the long-term clinical effectiveness of a hospital-based skin and needle hygiene program aimed to
prevent bacterial infections among persons who inject opioids.
 During the K01 project period, the candidate will develop a specific skill set in three primary domains:
(1) advanced quantitative methods for simulation modeling; (2) understanding the design, operationalization,
and evaluation of hospital-based interventions for PWID; and (3) measuring healthcare utilization and cost-
effectiveness analyses alongside clinical trials. Training will be accomplished through an intensive combination
of formal structured courses, training workshops and field experiences, applied research experience, and
focused mentorship in mathematical modeling, biostatistics, addiction, hospital-based interventions, and health
economics. Acquisition of these skills will allow the candidate to accomplish his long-term goal, which is to
become an independently-funded investigator and global expert on clinical decision making and health policy
at the intersection of substance use and infectious diseases."

Pancreatic islet dysfunction is central to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathogenesis and consists of both α-cell and β-cell dysfunction. The regulation of α-cell and β-cell health is determined by a complex network of paracrine regulators that are incompletely defined. To improve the treatment and prevention of T2DM, it is critical to have a complete picture of α-cell and β-cell regulation. We have identified the signaling protein, 14-3-3ζ, as an important regulator of β-cell function and crosstalk between α-cells and β-cells. Specifically, recent work from our lab demonstrates that β-cell 14-3-3ζ inhibition increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and activates α-cell active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production and secretion in mouse and human islets. It is increasingly evident that α-cells play an important role in the potentiation of GSIS, thereby expanding their function beyond that of the traditional counterregulatory role. Efforts to understand the role of the α-cell in the regulation of islet function have revealed both transcriptional and functional heterogeneity. Further analysis of this heterogeneity suggests that functionally distinct α-cell subpopulations display alterations in their hormone profile, with some α-cells producing active GLP-1 from the proglucagon precursor. While GLP-1 and glucagon are both able to potentiate GSIS via local actions mediated by GLP-1R and glucagon receptor expressed by β-cells, only glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose production (HGP). In effect then by switching their endocrine output from glucagon to GLP-1, α-cells favor GSIS over the stimulation of HGP. How plasticity in α-cell endocrine profile is regulated and how it impacts overall islet function is unknown. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that β-cell 14-3-3ζ regulates GSIS by enhancing α-cell to β-cell crosstalk. Aim 1 will determine the role of α-cell GLP-1 in 14-3-3ζ regulation of islet function. To this end, we will assess GSIS in response to β-cell 14-3-3ζ inhibition in islets from wild-type mice and mice with α-cell-specific inability to produce GLP-1. Aim 2 will define the regulation of plasticity in α-cell hormone production by β-cell 14-3-3ζ. To this end, we will define the regulation of GLP-1+ α-cells induced by β-cell 14-3-3ζ ablation and determine the receptor class responsible for activation of α-cell GLP-1 production."

 Trichomonas vaginalis is estimated to be the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection (STI). It
causes considerable and costly perinatal/reproductive morbidity, disproportionately affects persons of color,
and can amplify HIV transmission. After our two trials found multi-dose oral metronidazole (MTZ) to be superior
to single-dose 2 g oral MTZ, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends multi-dose
MTZ as the treatment of choice for T. vaginalis in all women. Since neither trial included men and there is a
paucity of data in men, single-dose 2 g oral MTZ stands as the recommended treatment for men. In both
female trials, however, even though multi-dose oral MTZ was found to be superior to single-dose MTZ, multi-
dose MTZ still had unacceptably high rates of breakthrough infection (9%-11%). With approximately 2.6 million
cases of T. vaginalis per year in the United States, over 280,000 persons/year are estimated to be insufficiently
treated with multi-dose oral MTZ. Thus, there is a critical need to refine T. vaginalis treatment. Single-dose 2
g oral secnidazole (SEC), a next generation 5-nitroimidazole, may be a good option. Our recent trial found that
single-dose 2 g oral SEC was superior to placebo in T. vaginalis-infected women. Oral SEC has multiple
benefits compared to multi-dose oral MTZ including a longer half-life and improved tolerability. Single-dose
SEC poses less burden on the patient and can treat bacterial vaginosis, a common comorbidity among women
with T. vaginalis. On the other hand, MTZ is far less costly and can be given during pregnancy/lactation. The
overall goals of this multi-centered, randomized trial are to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of oral multi-dose MTZ compared to single-dose oral SEC inboth women and men with T. vaginalis. Aim 1. To
examine the optimal treatment for T. vaginalis infection in women and men. This will be done by
conducting an open-label, randomized, multi-centered, parallel phase IV clinical trial comparing oral multi-dose
MTZ (500 mg BID for 7 days) to single-dose oral 2 g SEC for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women and men.
The test-of-cure (TOC) visit will be 4 weeks (± 1 week) after completion of treatment. We hypothesize that T.
vaginalis repeat infection rates at TOC will be 1.75 lower in the single-dose 2 g oral SEC arm versus the multi-
dose oral MTZ arm. Aim 2 To compare the cost effectiveness of multi-dose oral MTZ versus single-dose
oral SEC for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection. We will compare the direct and indirect costs of
treatment using either arm, taking into consideration the reproductive and perinatal outcomes associated with
T. vaginalis infection as well as increased risk for HIV-acquisition. We hypothesize the single-dose SEC will
have higher initial cost but will be more cost effective compared to multi-dose MTZ, largely due to lower
breakthrough rates. Data from these aims will fill critical gaps in the literature and provide data on refining the
treatment of T. vaginalis among women and men, with the long-term goal of reducing health disparities
attributable to this common infection."

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown promise as targeted therapeutics for treating cancer, including
solid tumors. However, no ADC has gained FDA approval for treatment of prostate cancer. Multiple factors
including target selection and heterogeneity, as well as insufficient tumor uptake and intracellular delivery,
could have contributed to the limited success of current ADCs. To overcome these limitations and improve
treatment outcomes, we propose to develop novel bispecific ADCs (bisADCs) that target emerging tumor cell
surface antigens (CD46, B7-H3, and DLL3) with clinical validations. Bispecific targeting, which engages two
distinct tumor antigens simultaneously, holds promise for overcoming target heterogeneity, improving
internalization and tumor penetration. Unlike a combination of monoclonal ADCs, bisADCs possess the unique
ability to exploit synergistic interactions between targets and influence their intracellular fate. This concept
provides a compelling rationale for exploring bisADCs in prostate cancer treatment. We discovered CD46 as a
novel prostate cancer cell surface antigen that is persistently expressed across differentiation patterns. We
developed and translated a CD46-targeted ADC (FOR46) to phases I (NCT03575819) & II (NCT05011188)
trials. This CD46 ADC showed good tolerability and promising early efficacy signals in mCRPC patients. B7-
H3, another emerging target widely expressed in prostate cancer, has been targeted with ADCs like MGC018
and DS-7300, showing acceptable safety and encouraging efficacy in early-phase trials. B7-H3 negativity is
rare in adenocarcinomas but more common in CRPC with neuroendocrine features. DLL3 is overexpressed in
several neuroendocrine tumors, and a DLL3-targeted ADC (Rova-T) has been tested in neuroendocrine
prostate cancer in a phase I trial, making DLL3 a credentialed target for this subtype. We propose to develop
bisADCs based on those emerging novel targets to address both adenocarcinoma (B7-H3 x CD46) and small
cell neuroendocrine (DLL3 x CD46) prostate cancer. In Aim 1, we will determine target co-expression patterns
in mCRPC patient samples, generate novel human monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies against the targets
of interest, and construct bispecific antibodies (bisAbs) using robust Ig-like architectures, and generate
bisADCs carrying diverse drug payloads with clinical validation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the therapeutic
efficacy of B7-H3 x CD46 and DLL3 x CD46 bisADCs in animal models representing adenocarcinoma and
small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, respectively. We will benchmark the bisADCs against current ADCs
being tested in clinical trials, and identify lead bisADCs that demonstrate improved efficacy against
heterogeneous tumors, including target-low tumors, and enhanced survival in animal models of prostate
cancer. The proposed study presents a novel approach to next-generation ADC development and has a clear
path of translation to the clinic in prostate cancer patients who have progressed beyond current therapies."

Organ transplantation remains the best and most cost-effective clinical solution for end-stage organ failure;
however, it comes with the burden of lifelong immunosuppression. Although effective in preventing allograft
rejection, immunosuppressive drugs may not prevent the development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). The
presence of DSA in transplant recipients is associated with an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection
(ABMR), leading to chronic rejection and allograft failure. DSA is a key component of diagnosing ABMR in kidney,
lung, liver, and heart transplants; however, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood and remains
highly variable between transplanted organs. Since DSA are not equally pathogenic, there is an urgent need
to identify the specific DSA parameters that increase the risk of ABMR. Conventional transplant research
to study the role of DSA in ABMR is performed in clinical settings or animal models but rarely uses in vitro
platforms. With the recent passing of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, organs-on-a-chip (OoC) technologies have
gained tremendous attraction for their capability to generate clinically translatable data. Several OoC models of
human organs, such as the lungs, heart, and liver, have been manufactured on chips; however, no existing
model allows for studying ABMR. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop and validate a multi-organ-on-a-
chip (MoC) platform comprised of a vascularized liver-on-a-chip (vLoC) and heart-on-a-chip (vHoC) with a fully
integrated microfluidic label-free electrochemical (EC) biosensor system to study the underlying mechanism
of ABMR. Modeling ABMR on-a-chip requires a microfluidic device that mimics the physiological function of in
vivo tissues. The donor’s endothelium is a crucial determinant in allograft rejection mechanisms because it is the
first contact site with the recipient’s immune system. Despite recent OoC models including microvasculatures,
no vascularized on-a-chip platforms have been established to study DSA-mediated damage of tissue organoids.
To bridge this gap, we propose to develop a functional and automated MoC platform that models and monitors
ABMR. The scientific premise is to demonstrate that not all DSA can induce ABMR and chronic rejection
equally. First, we will engineer a vLoC and a vHoC model using blood-derived endothelial cells to generate a
microvascular bed that mimics the allograft endothelium. Then, we will model ABMR by perfusing allogeneic
anti-HLA antibodies (DSA and non-DSA) through the vLoC and vHoC models. ABMR markers will be assessed
and correlated with DSA parameters (HLA specificity, epitopes, isotype (IgG and IgM), subclass (1-4), C1q
binding ability, and titer). Last, we will develop and validate a fully automated MoC platform for long-term,
accurate, label-free ABMR monitoring through the seamless integration of the microfluidic EC biosensors with
the vLoC and vHoC. This platform can significantly impact the understanding of ABMR and identify permissible
DSA specificities that will increase the translation of novel ABMR treatment, including tolerance-inducing
protocols and regimens, and organ allocation for sensitized patients."
10862545,"Cigarette craving is a key feature of smoking, which is the leading preventable cause of death. While smokers
often recognize this danger, during moments of temptation the appeal of smoking rises and the habit persists.
Unfortunately, research has struggled to develop treatments for craving relief. One approach showing promise
is the strategic use of olfactory cues (OCs) to reduce craving. Two studies from the PI’s lab indicate that
pleasant OCs reduce cigarette craving. Others have replicated this effect for food craving. Yet little is known
about the nature of this urge-reducing effect, its underlying mechanisms, and individual differences that
moderate its benefit. This application addresses FOA PAR 18-323: Fundamental Science Research on Mind
and Body Approaches by testing this use of a natural product (OCs) to control craving and by testing the
“neurocognitive and behavioral mechanisms underlying” OC-induced craving relief (an FOA objective).
Integrating theory and research derived from three disciplines rarely applied to smoking (olfaction, emotion,
cognition), the project will test the impact of pleasant OCs on craving. Also pertinent to the FOA, this project
will use innovative nonverbal measures of emotion and advanced multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) (along
with traditional fMRI analyses) to evaluate precise, theory-driven, underlying mechanisms (working memory,
attentional engagement, delay discounting, response inhibition) for how OCs attenuate craving. The project
will test why certain smokers may have trouble managing their craving and why OCs may be especially useful
for a subset of smokers. Abstinent daily and nondaily smokers (n=250) will attend a multi-session experiment.
They will rate a set of OCs on several dimensions, including pleasantness, mood, and related memories. They
next perform a series of cognitive tasks during an fMRI session. They will receive in vivo smoking cues, which
together with smoking abstinence, elicits robust urges. Next they will sniff an OC (one they had rated earlier as
either pleasant or neutral) while urge and mood are assessed. MVPA will be used to generate “neural
fingerprints” for cognitive and affective processes in each smoker to probe the mechanisms underlying their
own OC-induced urge reduction, and to inform matching of subjects to OCs. Subjects also will attend a
behavioral session using a novel set of craving-related responses, including an urge pressure dynamometer and
the Facial Action Coding System, to identify those most sensitive to urge relief, and to generate behavioral
proxies for patterns of fMRI activity. As a secondary aim, we will test the effects of OCs on urge and smoking in
the field. This translational study, drawing on fMRI and behavioral data regarding the unique power of OCs to
alter affective states, will test key mechanisms of urge relief related to neurobehavioral addiction models. This
interdisciplinary research also should stimulate future research testing the impact of OCs, alone or with other
interventions (e.g., nicotine patches, cognitive therapies) on smoking cessation. Regardless of outcome, this
research will provide important data on the interaction of emotional and cognitive processes during craving."

Influenza virus is a major health burden worldwide, resulting in billions of dollars in medical costs and up to
600,00 deaths annually. Thus, a major challenge of pulmonary vaccinology is to develop an approach that will
provide long-lasting and durable immunity in the lung. Seasonal influenza infection is driven largely by
antigenic shift to avoid established antibody responses, limiting the efficacy of current influenza vaccinations
designed to generate humoral immunity to the hemagglutinin protein. One approach to this problem is the
development of vaccines designed to promote the generation of influenza-specific, lung-resident T cell
memory. In animal models and human studies, memory T cells have been shown to significantly reduce viral
loads after influenza challenge, leading to faster viral clearance, decreased transmission, and milder or sub-
clinical symptoms. Lung tissue-resident memory T cells (lung TRM) have been found to be critical for this
protective cellular response to influenza, but lung TRM numbers gradually decline over time. Despite thie
importance for pulmonary immunity, we still have only a basic understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that control their generation and long-term maintenance, nor have we identified the optimal
vaccination strategies to induce durable lung TRM. Furthermore, the influence on unique microenvironments of
the lung interstitium and lung airways on TRM biology is poorly understood. This proposal seeks to develop a
program in lung TRM biology centered on three related themes: (i) investigating the molecular programming of
TRM that enables their generation following infection and vaccination; (ii) defining the cell- and tissue-intrinsic
mechanisms that drive the gradual loss of lung TRM and testing the ability of novel vaccinations strategies to
improve lung TRM longevity; and (iii) determining the transcriptional and epigenetic programming of influenza-
specific lung TRM at the bulk and single cell level using a biorepository of human lung samples. The overall goal
of this project is to understand the mechanisms driving the initial generation and subsequent decline of
influenza-specific TRM from the lung interstitium and airways. The knowledge gained in this study will provide a
deep understanding of the mechanisms that regulate lung TRM biology to better inform future vaccine design
against respiratory pathogens."
10862548,"Currently, there is no intervention capable of curing or even slowing the cognitive impairment and
neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our long-term goal is to develop safe and
effective, preventive and therapeutic interventions to slow, halt, and/or reverse cognitive decline and
neurodegenerative progression to AD-dementias. The objective of this application is to confirm the safety
and establish the efficacy of an 8-week intermittent-hypoxia training (IHT) program, which can be applied as
a novel treatment to improve neurocognitive function in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
(aMCI), a pre-clinical state associated with a heightened risk of progressing to AD. The central hypothesis is
that IHT imparted by brief, cyclic, repetitive, low-intensity, normobaric hypoxia exposures is a safe and
effective means of optimizing cerebral circulation and conferring neuroprotection, thereby improving
cognitive function in patients with aMCI. IHT has been found to promote neuroprotection, neuroplasticity,
and neurogenesis, and to improve cerebrovascular function and cerebral tissue oxygenation. Therefore, the
rationale for this proposed research is that, by mobilizing neuroprotective growth/trophic factors and by
improving cerebral circulation, IHT is expected to be a powerful intervention to prevent and/or reverse
cognitive decline and neurodegenerative progression to AD-dementias. The specific aims are proposed to
confirm the safety and efficacy of an 8-week IHT program for improving neurocognitive function in patients
with aMCI, and to demonstrate IHT’s capacity to improve cerebrovascular function at rest and during
mental, physiological and hypoxia challenges, and mobilize neuroprotective growth/trophic factors. This
proposed phase I trial is innovative and its contribution is significant because it will be the first step in a
continuum of research that is expected to develop a specific and practical intervention which can be safely
and effectively applied to elderly patients to prevent and treat cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.
Ultimately, this investigation is expected to foster the development of novel interventions for prevention and
treatment of mild cognitive impairment and AD-dementias."

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical during cardiac remodeling in altering the cell’s response. Recently, class I
small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) showed enormous impact on the heart’s function during ischemic injury
or cardiac remodeling. Adverse cardiac remodeling stimulates fibrotic scar deposition due to increased TGFβ
activity on fibroblasts. In the last decade, a non-conventional class I SLRP protein, asporin (ASPN), has been
shown to play a role in regulating TGFβ signaling and cell viability in cancer and osteoporosis. The biological
impact of ASPN in regulating TGFβ and cell viability in heart is unknown. Our long-term goal is to dissect the
detailed mechanisms regulating ASPN activity and its impact on fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, particularly in
the setting of cardiac remodeling. These discoveries will facilitate design of effective ASPN-based therapies for
heart failure. The objective of this grant is to characterize the role of ASPN in fibrosis and cardiomyocyte cell
viability. Our central hypothesis is that ASPN is released by fibroblasts during cardiac stress and inhibits TGFβ
signaling to reduce fibrosis during cardiac remodeling. Further, released ASPN acts on cardiomyocytes to
upregulate autophagy and prevent cell death. Our rationale is that identification of the mechanisms to stimulate
ASPN-protective effects in cardiac remodeling will offer new therapeutic opportunities. This project will further
test therapeutic peptide delivery as well as AAV9-mediated delivery of ASPN gene for efficacy in mitigating
reperfusion injury and cardiac remodeling. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) ASPN
inhibits fibrosis to maintain cardiac function and prevents adverse cardiac remodeling; (Aim 2) ASPN induces
autophagy in cardiomyocytes; (Aim 3) ASPN regulates cardiomyocyte cell death in the setting of ischemia-
reperfusion injury. Upon conclusion, we will better understand the role of novel role of ASPN in inhibiting fibrosis
and activating autophagy for beneficial cardiac remodeling. This contribution is significant since it will establish
the several pathways targeted by ASPN from ECM to fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, current
therapies, while promising in limiting ischemic injury, fail to address the key issue of adverse cardiac remodeling
in heart failure patients. The proposed research is innovative as we will investigate the effects of ASPN in
regulating fibrosis and cardiomyocyte cell death, an unexamined process to date. Insight into the mechanisms
of ASPN activity will pave the way for ASPN-based therapies to benefit cardiac remodeling."

The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is well known to mediate detrimental inflammatory processes in peripheral
tissues. IL-1 is elevated in age and in neurodegenerative disease. As a result, IL-1 has become a major focus
of anti-inflammatory strategies to treat neuroinflammation following acute injury and in chronic
neurodegenerative disease. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence that neurons are damaged through the direct
actions of IL-1. To the contrary, a neuron-specific “non-canonical” IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) pathway that
promotes, rather than erodes, neuronal viability has been identified. Despite this paradigm-shifting observation,
the non-canonical pathway has received little attention. Much remains unknown about how neuronal IL-1R1
signaling contributes to the brain's inflammatory milieu, synaptic physiology, and cognitive function, and
recover from injury and progression of neurodegeneration. This knowledge gap could undermine potential
neuroprotective approaches that target suppression of IL-1 as part of the mechanism-of-action.
To address this knowledge gap, we will use novel mouse models exhibiting neuron-specific modulation of IL-1
signaling (i.e., IL-1R1-floxed mice to look at neuron-specific knockdown and IL-1R1-restore mice to look at the
neuron-specific expression of IL-1R1). Our overarching hypothesis is that neuronal IL-1R1 signaling is
inherently protective.
We will test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:
 SA1 Define the role of the neuronal IL-1R1 pathway in the inflammatory response to a CHI in mice.
 SA2 Define the neuronal IL-1R1 pathway in homeostatic synaptic plasticity after a CHI in mice.
 SA3 Determine the temporal role of neuronal IL-1R1 in the cognitive recovery following a CHI.
If our hypothesis is affirmed, we will provide knowledge of a new neuroprotective approach and enable the
development of new formulations of existing anti-inflammatory interventions that preserve the neuroprotective
functions of IL-1. The development of novel IL-1R1 therapies would include agents that only suppress the
inflammatory IL-1R1 pathway or only activate the neuroprotective IL-1R1 pathway."

 I am a physician/scientist focusing on the development of optical neuroimaging techniques to improve
bedside detection of neurologic injury in critically-ill children. The goal of my mentored career development award
is to acquire training in mouse models of hypoxia as well as in advanced statistical methods for the analysis of
resting-state brain activity. This training will launch an independent research career with the aim to bring imaging
biomarkers from bench to bedside.
 Many pediatric diseases that were once universally fatal (e.g., complex congenital heart disease and extreme
prematurity) now have relatively good survival rates. However, neurodevelopmental outcomes have improved
only marginally. With timely intervention, it is possible to minimize hypoxic injury, but current bedside tools are
insensitive and inadequate for this purpose. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of clinical populations limits clinical
studies. Each patient has a unique injury and treatment, and neuroimaging is performed at varying times after
injury; thus, it can be difficult to rigorously analyze such data to determine the best, most generalizable
biomarkers.
 The present work aims to solve these problems by using mouse models of hypoxemic neurologic injury,
robust statistical methods, optical functional neuroimaging techniques, and resting-state hemodynamic
assessment (e.g., functional connectivity). The optical methods are similar to functional magnetic resonance
imaging but have much lower cost, higher portability, and higher through-put. My proposal will test the hypothesis
that resting-state hemodynamic metrics can serve as neuroimaging biomarkers of injury after acute and chronic
hypoxia. Aim 1 will develop statistical methods adapted to optical neuroimaging to permit more robust noise
filtering, brain segmentation, atlasing, and image analysis. Aim 2 will use resting-state hemodynamics in the
hyperacute phase of ischemic stroke to identify the penumbra. Aim 3 will study the longitudinal development of
functional connectivity networks across mouse development and the disruptive effects of chronic hypoxemia.
 This research will be conducted under the mentorship of Arjun Yodh, PhD, with co-mentorship by Daniel
Licht, MD; both faculty are recognized leaders in the development of optical neuromonitoring techniques. In
addition, I have assembled an interdisciplinary group of collaborators with expertise in mouse models of
hypoxemia, neuroimaging statistics, and advanced network analysis methods. I will benefit from this excellent
mentorship and research environment, and my unique optical neuroimaging methods offer a path to
independence. I am a board-certified pediatric cardiologist, and my long-term career goals are to combine
neuroimaging with a tenure-track position at a pediatric research hospital. The exceptional research environment
at CHOP/Penn will enable future translational studies in the intensive care unit, as well as further animal models
of disease.

10862812,"ABSTRACT
The zinc finger protein 24 (ZFP24) is required for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. ZFP24
binds to a consensus DNA sequence in proximity to genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation, and
this binding enhances target gene expression. ZFP24 contains four C2H2 zinc-finger domains that are
interspersed by three conserved linkers. ZFP24 DNA binding is controlled by phosphorylation of the conserved
linkers: phosphorylated ZFP24, which does not bind DNA, is the predominant form in oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (OPCs). As these cells mature into oligodendrocytes, the non-phosphorylated, DNA-binding
form accumulates. Our findings indicate that changes to ZFP24 phosphorylation control its binding to
regulatory regions of genes important for oligodendrocyte maturation, controls their expression, and thereby
regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination. Therefore, it is critical to identify the kinase(s)
and phosphatase(s) responsible for controlling the functional status of ZFP24. In the first aim we propose two
distinct unbiased screening approaches toward the identification of the ZFP24 kinase(s). We will also examine
the effect of inhibition of the identified kinase(s) on ZFP24 phosphorylation, ZFP24 activity, oligodendrocyte
maturation and myelin related gene expression. The second aim focuses on identifying the phosphatase(s)
that de-phosphorylates ZFP24 to generate the functional transcriptional factor. We will use a candidate
phosphatase screen, as well as an unbiased screen to identify these ZFP24 phosphatases. We will also
examine the effect of inhibition of the identified phosphatase(s) on ZFP24 activity, ZFP24 phosphorylation,
oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin related gene expression. In the third aim we will characterize
phosphorylation intermediate isoforms of ZFP24. We have identified ZFP24 isoforms in which one, two or all
three potential phosphorylation sites in the conserved ZFP24 linker domains are phosphorylated in cultured
oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Currently it is unclear whether these are non-functional, transitional ZFP24
isoforms, or if these forms are important intermediates with unique functions in oligodendrocyte development.
Therefore, in the third aim we will study the half-life of the intermediate forms and determine if the distinct
isoforms have unique functions in oligodendrocyte development. Aim four is devoted to the elucidation of the
potential role that ZFP24 plays in the CNS of adult animals, including myelin maintenance and remyelination.
We also propose to generate a new mouse model that will allow for the inducible expression of the active, non-
phosphorylated, form of ZFP24 in OPCs. This model will be used to test the potential ability of the active form
of ZFP24 to enhance remyelination. Overall, the studies described here will provide a more detailed
understanding of the role that ZFP24 phosphorylation plays in oligodendrocyte maturation, CNS myelination,
and remyelination. This understanding may allow for the therapeutic modulation of ZFP24 activity to enhance
the myelinating and remyelinating potential of OPCs."

There is a compelling and unmet medical need for new immunotherapies as current agents are not successful
for all cancer patients. The transmembrane protein BTN3A1 is a promising new immunotherapy target because
its agonist binding both removes inhibition of αβ T cells and activates γδ T cells. A BTN3A1 agonist effectively
treated a mouse model of ovarian cancer with low toxicity, suggesting further development of BTN3A1 agonists
is warranted. However, current small molecule BTN3A1 agonists are limited by poor PK properties, including low
stability, low membrane permeability, and limited tumor selectivity. Our preliminary data in this area shows that
BTN3A1 agonists based on a phosphonate scaffold have improved cellular stability relative to phosphate-based
agonists, and prodrug forms of these agonists have better potency. We have recently discovered a novel aryl-
acyloxyalkyl prodrug strategy that retains these features while also improving plasma stability and kinetics of
cellular uptake, and may increase tumor cell specificity. The overall objective of this program is to synthesize
novel BTN3A1 ligands with improved drug-like properties and evaluate them in cellular and mouse models of
cancer. Our central hypothesis is that novel synthetic agonists based on a phosphonate scaffold can engage
BTN3A1 to trigger an anti-cancer immune response by stimulating both αβ and γδ T cells. Stimulating both T
cell populations is innovative and potentially adventitious because they infiltrate tumors in a pattern that is not
correlated and γδ T cell infiltration can be more favorable to overall survival. To achieve these goals, we will
apply our novel aryl-acyloxyalkyl phosphonate protecting strategy to BTN3A1 agonists. We will synthesize a
series of aryl-acyloxyalkyl phosphonate BTN3A1 ligand prodrugs optimized for in vivo application, and
characterize their stability, metabolism, potency and selectivity. We will use existing pilot compounds to address
fundamental unanswered questions of how BTN3A1 ligands activate the anti-cancer response of both αβ and γδ
T cells against lymphoma cells, but also more immunologically cold ovarian cancer cells. This would be the first
SAR study of BTN3A1 ligands on checkpoint inhibition of αβ T cells. We will examine the activity of these
compounds in animal models of lymphoma and ovarian cancer, and assess the safety of the compounds. The
ultimate goal is to identify a safe and effective BTN3A1 ligand prodrug that can be used for cancer
immunotherapy. These findings will come at a time when the biological understanding of anti-cancer immunity
and the role of BTN3A1 is far from complete. Thus, these studies have the potential for high impact on the field
of cancer immunotherapy."

The Flavivirus and Alphavirus ReVAMPP (FLARE) Center will develop and optimize protein nanoparticle,
virion-based, and mRNA vaccine platforms, and monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based treatments to rapidly
respond to emerging flaviviruses and alphaviruses with pandemic potential. A key goal is to pair specific
antigen designs and vaccine platforms so that successful paradigms can be rapidly adapted in a “plug and
play” manner to emerging viruses within the same family. Our suite of antigen design strategies, vaccine
platforms, state-of-the-art virological and immunological assays, extensive animal model experience,
detailed analysis of correlates of protection, and experienced industry partners (e.g., Moderna) will enable
us to generate innovative vaccines and mAb combinations against key targeted prototype flaviviruses and
alphaviruses, which then can be applied to related new threats. Moreover, with our collective academic
experience in vaccinology and collaborative experience with industry partners, we can make informed
Go/No-Go decisions to focus on antigens and vaccines with the greatest chance for clinical efficacy and
safety. Our FLARE Center integrates the work of multiple academic groups, with proven records of collaboration,
that have the highest levels of expertise in flavivirus and alphavirus biology, antigen design, structural biology,
antibody structure and function, mAb generation and characterization, vaccine development, B and T cell
immunity, Fc effector functions, and animal challenge studies, all working toward the goal of designing optimized
immunogens for incorporation into lipid-encapsulated mRNA, nanoparticles, or other vectors to create vaccines
that can protect against infection and disease caused by existing and future flavivirus and alphavirus threats.
Our FLARE Center is composed of five primary Research Projects: two vaccine projects that collectively focus
on prototype flaviviruses including West Nile (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), and Dengue (DENV)
viruses; two vaccine projects, that focus on prototype alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV) and
Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) viruses; and a mAb therapy project that focuses on both flaviviruses
(WNV and DENV) and alphaviruses (CHIKV). These Projects are served by an Administrative Core, a Data
Management Core, and three Scientific Cores that perform structural biology and protein engineering, animal
vaccination and challenge, and correlates of immune protection experiments in collaboration with multiple
projects. Our network of expert investigators, innovative Project and Cores, and state-of-the art virological and
immunological approaches will enable us to develop vaccine and mAb therapeutics against prototype flaviviruses
and alphaviruses that can be readily and rapidly applied to other contemporary and newly emerging related viral
threats."

This application focuses on advanced melanoma, a highly aggressive type of skin cancer that arises from the
pigment-producing melanocytes of the body. Despite recent advances in molecularly targeted therapy and
immunotherapeutic agents with impressive response rates, there remain patients who either do not respond to
such therapies or who eventually relapse. The 5-year overall survival rate for metastatic melanoma is below
20%. Progressive dedifferentiation and phenotypic switching of melanoma cells under cellular stress are
considered to be a major driver for both tumor progression and therapy resistance. However, the molecular
mechanisms that govern this process, and their interplay with genetic lesions and the tumor microenvironment
are poorly understood. TFEB is a member of the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors and master regulators
of cell differentiation pathways. Our preliminary studies identified TFEB repression as a novel dependency of
oncogene-driven melanoma progression. We showed that TFEB activation globally re-invigorates
transcriptional differentiation of melanocytes, while its inactivation provokes phenotypic transition towards the
invasive and drug-resistant states that is associated with aberrant TGF-b upregulation. Furthermore,
transcriptomic and immune cell profiling of tumors from primary melanoma patients confirmed dampened
TFEB expression and function that also correlates with tumors’ immune evasive microenvironment. These
findings lead us to hypothesize that TFEB-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of melanoma cell
differentiation states represents a key mechanism disabling melanoma progression, which also
reshapes tumor immune microenvironment for enhanced anti-tumor immunity. We will test the
hypothesis by (Aim 1) defining the molecular mechanisms of TFEB-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of
melanoma cell plasticity and phenotype switching; and by (Aim 2) investigating in detail the in vivo impact of
TFEB alteration in melanoma progression and immune evasion. Successful completion of this study will
provide mechanistic insights into tumor cell-switching processes and hold promise for the development of
novel therapeutic strategies to reverse this process for the prevention and elimination of tumor metastasis and
recurrence."

Small-Molecule Penetration and Efflux in Gram-Negative Bacteria
Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to
combat this growing threat to public health. These pathogens have high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics due
to their combination of a two-membrane cell envelope, which presents a permeability barrier to small
molecules, and prevalent efflux pumps, which eject molecules that have successfully penetrated the barrier. A
major obstacle to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of
small molecules that correlate with penetration and efflux across this barrier. As a result, large screening
campaigns of existing discovery libraries have mostly failed to provide new antibacterials. Similarly, while
potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, converting them into compounds with
whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging.
To address this critical problem, we have developed a comprehensive experimental and computational
platform to evaluate and model Small-molecule Penetration and Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negative
bacteria (SPEAR-GN, “speargun”). We have established all of the key enabling technologies required and
strong proof of concept for the effectiveness of this platform. We will now use our platform to assemble the
larger datasets required to train robust machine learning models of penetration and efflux that will be of broad
utility in antibacterial drug discovery. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries to map bacterial
penetration and efflux space, analyze compound accumulation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Acinetobacter baumannii using isogenic strain sets that decouple outer-membrane penetration from efflux,
evaluate the role of the BamA outer membrane protein in facilitated permeation of antibiotics, develop machine
learning models based on the assay data to predict compound accumulation, and use the models to design
and synthesize new molecules with improved accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria. Success in this project
will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery to address this major public health
threat.
This project will be carried out by an established multidisciplinary team with a proven track record in this field
and extensive combined expertise in library synthesis and medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and microbiology,
high-throughput assays and mass spectrometry, cheminformatics and machine learning, and antibacterial drug
discovery."

Highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) which dramatically improves pulmonary function has been developed
for people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In 2019, the HEMT elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor (ETI) became available
for the 90% of CF teens and adults with at least one F508del mutation. Use of ETI is now widespread in the US
and is standard of care. With chronic use of ETI, some people with CF (PwCF) have resolution of pulmonary
symptoms and successfully wean burdensome daily pulmonary treatments. Unfortunately, the pulmonary
response is variable and there are some PwCF who have no, or only mild, pulmonary improvement with ETI.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of improvement in either exocrine or endocrine pancreatic function in CF teens
and adults with ETI. This lack of a pancreatic response most likely is related to the fact that in CF the pancreas
is largely replaced by lipofibrotic tissue by the teenage years, leaving little to no pancreatic tissue for ETI-
mediated restoration of function. However, recent data show that younger CF children may have a significant
pancreatic response to ETI. In April 2023, the FDA approved ETI for CF children aged 2 to 5 years. Our overall
hypothesis is that in this young age group, chronic ETI will prevent progression of airway disease to
bronchiectasis, prevent further destruction of pancreatic exocrine tissue, possibly permit repair/regeneration of
exocrine function, and prevent CF related diabetes (CFRD), the most serious complication of pancreatic disease.
In this project, we propose to study a cohort of 30 CF children aged 2- to 5-years old before and four years after
starting ETI for clinical indications. We aim to: 1. Determine the impact of ETI-mediated CFTR restoration on
progression of airway disease in these young CF children; 2. Determine the impact of ETI-mediated CFTR
restoration on pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function in this cohort; and 3. Elucidate computational
phenotypes of therapeutic responsiveness in the lungs and the pancreas and their trajectories using machine
learning. This project is important as it has the potential to usher in the next generation of therapeutics for CF
which will be the initiation of HEMT in infancy to prevent the many later manifestations of CF including
bronchiectasis, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and CFRD."
10859043,"Recent outbreaks of arboviral diseases such as Zika and West Nile have their roots in tropical forests.
Their spread coincides with significant land conversion for agriculture, impacting arthropod vectors and
reservoirs of zoonotic diseases. Our decade-long epidemiological studies in Panama's Darien region indicate
high incidence of zoonotic alphaviruses in humans, wildlife and more recently, in livestock. In Darien, open
pasture ranching and crop farming coexist with agroforestry, an important climate change mitigation strategy that
integrates crops, livestock and forest. Despite the rising global adoption of agroforestry, its impact on infectious
disease risk is understudied. Our research aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating zoonotic arboviral
transmission in Darien in relation to its agricultural practices, including agroforestry. Various factors, from
biodiversity shifts to land tenure benefits and irrigation schemes, likely influence disease transmission. We
hypothesize that landscapes that merge forest, agriculture and human dwellings potentially enhance the spread
of zoonotic arboviruses due to increased overlap of vectors, vertebrate reservoirs including livestock, and
humans.
 Our first aim in this study is to assess agroforestry's impact on zoonotic arboviral risk among the agrarian
population and livestock in Darien, Panama, by conducting serosurveys and acute febrile studies to inform
habitat suitability modeling. Interviews with participants will provide data on health and social determinants
influencing agriculture and zoonoses interactions. Our second aim is to characterize vector ecology, infection
rates, and host use across an agricultural gradient. We will study immature vector breeding preferences and
water quality, and employ a variety of vector trapping methods to assess viral transmission rates and blood meal
origins to shed light on shifts is host usage within agroforestry environments. Our third aim is to map zoonotic
arboviral risk using geospatial and field data. We will also analyze natural selection and gene flow of the
predominant zoonotic arbovirus in the region, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, across the agricultural
gradient. We will use genomes derived from field isolates (mosquito, animal and human), along with regional
historical isolates, to test the hypothesis that increased host diversity at the forest/agriculture ecotone fosters
greater VEEV genetic diversification, leading to the emergence of new variants capable of causing epizootics.
 The research outcomes will be instrumental in defining transmission dynamics and health burden of
significant zoonotic arboviruses and informing preventive measures. This understanding will guide land use and
health policies in Darien, serve as a blueprint for interventions, and help ensure alignment of climate and health
objectives within the context of agroforestry. Our methodologies and findings will have broad applicability across
regions with similar ecologies."
10859067,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Aging is the most predictive risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Aged arteries exhibit increased large artery
stiffness and blunted endothelium dependent dilation; both of these changes occur prior to the onset of overt
cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis or stroke. Several lines of evidence have supported the
emerging concept of cell non-autonomous aging, where signals arising from one cell type can drive the
degenerative process of aging in other types of cells. Consistent with this concept, we have recently shown
that T cells play a critical role in the development of age-related arterial stiffening and impairments in arteriolar
endothelium dependent dilation. Despite this observation the T cell subtype(s), the mechanisms that result in T
cell accumulation around the arteries and how T cells influence the cells of the artery remain unclear. We have
found substantial age-related accumulation of memory CD8+ T cells making proinflammatory cytokines in the
aorta and in the mesenteric vasculature. Eomesodermin (Eomes) is a transcription factor that drives many
features consistent with CD8+ T cell aging. We have observed increased Eomes protein in both splenic CD8+ T
cells as well as those that accumulate in the arteries with age. In addition to alterations in CD8+ phenotype,
CD8+ trafficking also appears to be altered with age. CCL5 is a chemokine that is a potent T cell recruiter.
Interestingly, our preliminary data indicates that CD8+ cells themselves generate CCL5, potentially initiating a
feed forward cascade where CD8+ derived CCL5 recruit more T cells to the arteries driving arterial
inflammation and cell non-autonomous arterial aging. In preliminary observations, we have also observed
increased CD8+ proinflammatory cytokine production and increased proportions of Eomes expressing cells in
CD8+ cells from older human donors, supporting translational potential. These observations lead to the
hypothesis that both the memory/proinflammatory phenotype of CD8+ and altered CD8+ T cell trafficking drive
cell non-autonomous arterial aging. To test this hypothesis, we will assess the phenotype of immune cells
accumulating in the arteries, the phenotype of the artery, large artery stiffness and endothelium dependent
dilation in arteries from a range of mouse models including: pharmacological and genetic deletion of T cell
subtypes and adoptive transfer of young and old T cells to T cell deficient mice, as well as, pharmacological
and genetic inhibition of CCL5 signaling and adoptive transfer of CCL5 deficient T cells. We will also determine
whether Eomes and CCL5 signaling is associated with impaired endothelium dependent dilation and arterial
stiffness in older adults. Lastly, we will employ cell culture models to determine whether CD8+ T cells from older
adults can directly induce cellular changes consistent with fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. The results of
these studies will provide translational and mechanistic insight into the role of aged CD8+ T cell in cell non-
autonomous arterial aging and identify targets for intervention to preserve health with age."

The Clinical and Biospecimen Core (Core A) will support each Project in the Program by implementing all
proposed studies involving human research participants. The long-term goal of the Program is to identify new
strategies to prevent pulmonary fibrosis (PF) by advancing understand of the pathobiological cascade that
initiates progressive PF. The Program is focused on the pre-symptomatic period, which represents the ideal
time for therapeutic interventions to modify the course of PF. Using state-of-the-art single-cell and spatial
transcriptomic approaches, biomarker analysis, and environmental exposure assessment, the Projects will
elucidate critical factors that underlie early disease pathogenesis. Dr. Salisbury, Dr. Blackwell, and other Core
personnel have established a reputation as leaders in PF research, including conduct of investigator-initiated
clinical trials and observational studies. The Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF) Registry is an observational
study maintained by Core personnel that has been a key resource to identify asymptomatic members of FPF
families who are at risk to develop FPF. The At-Risk for FPF Cohort, the backbone of this Program, was
incepted in 2008 and directed by Dr. Salisbury since 2019. The At-Risk Cohort has already recruited 489
research volunteers, who are asymptomatic relatives of patients with FPF, to undergo serial screening for pre-
clinical PF with high-resolution chest CTs (HRCTs), pulmonary function tests, and blood donation. The Specific
Aims for Core A are to: 1) Recruit research participants and perform all clinical procedures; 2) Coordinate
clinical studies, collect, maintain, and distribute data collected from human research subjects, and maintain
regulatory requirements; and 3) Process, catalog, and distribute biological specimens collected from human
research subjects. Key At-Risk Cohort sub-studies implemented by the Core include the Lung Sampling
(Bronchoscopy) in Pre-Clinical FPF Sub-Study, in which a total of 40 additional At-Risk Cohort participants will
undergo lung sampling via a research bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial brushing
(for airway epithelial cell collection), and transbronchial lung biopsies, and the Exposures in Pre-Clinical FPF
Sub-Study, in which up to 300 At-Risk Cohort participants will undergo a detailed environmental exposure
assessment with prospective sampling to measure potentially harmful exposures. Core A supports the
Program’s goals by maintaining the At-Risk for FPF Cohort, identifying those with pre-clinical (pre-
symptomatic) PF, implementing key sub-studies, and providing each Project with the necessary samples and
data."

This proposal is for a renewal of NIH funding for Washington University’s Genome Analysis Training Program
(GATP). The overall goal of the GATP is to train a diverse group of multidisciplinary, quantitatively
sophisticated leaders in genomic technology, science, and medicine. In this renewal, we are focusing
exclusively on training predoctoral students, because Washington University has an outstanding pool of highly
talented PhD and MD/PhD students from which we can recruit the very best for the GATP. We are requesting
funds to support 8 predoctoral trainees. If we are granted these slots the university will provide matching funds
to support an additional 4 trainees.
The GATP is designed to produce trainees who are sophisticated in their knowledge of both the experimental
and the mathematical / computational aspects of genome science. This is achieved through a rigorous set of
required classes and through research-based training. We have an outstanding group of 37 training faculty
who run world-class research labs and provide careful mentoring to our trainees. Our PhD programs in
Computational Biology and Genetics/Genomics were jointly ranked #1 in the nation in the 2018 US News &
World Report analysis, tied with MIT and Stanford.
We have made significant changes to our training program based on feedback from our trainees. Our trainees
consistently express an interest in learning about career paths that utilize their skills. In response we have
designed a set of mini-internship programs that take advantage of our connections to the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries, and to clinical genomics services. The opportunities are aimed at cultivating the
leadership capability of our trainees and fostering a broad understanding of the different work environments
and career paths in which genomics plays an important role. Many of our trainees are also interested in how
machine learning is applied to problems in the genome sciences. As such we made changes to the GATP that
ensure that all trainees are exposed to the foundational concepts underlying machine learning and artificial
intelligence. We have also made changes to our evaluation protocols to make sure that we are meeting our
goals in a way that is responsive to our trainees."
10845485,"The overall objective of this application is to build capacity in longitudinal survey research methods and
investigate the burden of dementia and related personal, social and health challenges in the older population of
Lebanon. Population aging is occurring across the entire world, including in many low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC). As a result, these countries face a rapidly growing burden of common age-associated
chronic illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Lebanon is a middle-income
country in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region where the prevalence of ADRD is estimated to be
among the highest in the world. There is currently very limited reliable information on the prevalence and
incidence of ADRD and on the primary ADRD risk factors in this population. Furthermore, LMIC countries like
Lebanon often face substantial challenges in the adequate provision of care for ADRD, and very little is known
about patterns of formal and informal care for the health and personal needs of affected older adults and their
families. There is also insufficient research capacity for the conduct of rigorous studies of ADRD to address the
population burden due to ADRD in Lebanon. The proposed project has two over-arching goals. First, it aims to
build new research capacity for the conduct of rigorous epidemiological studies of ADRD and other important
aging-related health and social outcomes, with particular emphasis on longitudinal research designs and
complex sampling strategies. The research capacity activities will be developed and carried out in close
collaboration between the investigative teams at the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the University of
Michigan, involving a series of training modules that are relevant to the social and cultural context in Lebanon.
Second, it aims to develop a new population-based cohort study and recruit a sample of 3,000 adults aged 60
and older who will participate in a structured assessment of dementia, caregiver needs and arrangements, and
other health and social domains relevant to understanding the challenges of population aging in Lebanon. The
study intends to generate important new information on novel risk factors for ADRD, especially as it relates to
the role of prolonged exposure to stressful social conditions throughout the lifecourse. Large segments of the
adult population have experienced political instability and conflict that has dominated public life in Lebanon
during the last four decades. It will also add important new information on caregiver needs and arrangements,
especially as it relates to the growth in the hiring of domestic migrant workers. This model of care for older
adults is increasingly replacing more traditional care models that rely on relatives. Findings from this work will
not only inform potential strategies to reduce the population burden due to ADRD, but are also expected to
increase our understanding of potentially important new risk factors for ADRD and the care arrangements for
older adults with ADRD in many other settings and populations around the world."
10847502,"Abstract
This application proposes to address one of the major translational limitations of using Bone Morphogenetic
Proteins (BMPs) for local bone induction in spine fusion. Since the FDA approval of recombinant human BMP-
2, it has consistently induced bone formation in widespread clinical use, but also has been associated with
several local side effects including inflammation, vascular permeability, seromas, hematomas, and nerve root
irritation. Our overall strategy is to locally inhibit the primary natural BMP antagonist, noggin, creating a BMP-
privileged zone that allows for lower BMP levels to induce bone formation. We propose to engineer a hybrid
scaffold combining a collagen sponge and a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or a nanostructured mineral
coating to deliver a novel small molecule that blocks noggin activity. In compelling preliminary data from rabbit
spine fusion studies, we show a significant increase in noggin production in surrounding soft tissue, an auto-
induction of local BMP-2 production in the fusion site, and a subsequent increase in noggin production in the
fusion site. To blunt the noggin negative feedback loop, we computationally designed a novel Small Molecule
Inhibitor (SMI) of noggin that blocks its binding to BMP-2 and enhances activity of exogenous and endogenous
BMPs. To provide spatiotemporal control of the noggin SMI, we engineered a hybrid collagen scaffold with either
a nanostructured mineral or a PLGA coating. This innovative noggin SMI strategy will allow lower BMP levels to
locally induce bone formation through enhanced cellular responsiveness. We hypothesize that locally blocking
the activity of noggin will disrupt/uncouple the negative feedback loop and allow the positive feedback loop to
prevail, thereby resulting in greater signal amplification of BMP-2 within the delivery scaffold. We propose the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the noggin SMI to BMP-2 ratio and dose windows to maximize the
positive and minimize the negative BMP feedback signaling loops in vitro and osteogenesis in vivo. Aim 2: To
engineer a hybrid biomaterial delivery system to control spatial and temporal release of the noggin SMI to
potentiate BMP-2 responsiveness. Aim 3: To demonstrate that a hybrid noggin SMI scaffold can lower the dose
of BMP-2 required to produce spine fusion. The potential impact of a decreased BMP dose is substantial for
improving the safety of activating the BMP signaling pathway for spinal fusion clinically."
10847506,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), has shown considerable success in the
treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), leading to durable responses in a subset of patients.
However, most patients do not derive long-term clinical benefit from existing immune therapies. Moving
forward, our team has prioritized identifying the determinants of ICI response in RCC, including the antigenic
targets, T cell phenotypes, and microenvironment features that ultimately dictate the effectiveness of tumor-
specific immunity.
 Human endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are often aberrantly expressed in numerous disease states,
including malignancy, and can lead to activation of both innate immunity (through sensing by the RIG-I/MDA-5
and cGAS-STING pathways) and adaptive immunity (by providing antigenic targets for tumor-specific CD8+ T
cells). The expression of ERVE-4 has been associated with response to ICI monotherapy (i.e. anti-PD-1) in an
analysis of a phase III randomized controlled trial in RCC, and an ERV-derived peptide (from ERVE-4) was
identified as a target epitope in a long-term RCC responder to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Beyond
recognition of tumor antigens, effective anti-tumor immunity requires a tumor microenvironment that permits
infiltrating CD8+ T cells to carry out their effector function. A high level of tumor infiltration by antigen-
experienced, non-exhausted CD8+ T cells has been associated with improved response to ICI monotherapy in
clinical trials of RCC. However, resistance to ICI monotherapy is still common, in part owing to the
immunosuppressive effects of infiltrating Treg and myeloid cells, and consequently combination (and not single
agent) therapies with PD-1 blockade as a backbone are now the standard-of-care treatment for advanced RCC.
It is therefore critical to understand the role of ERV expression, T cell phenotype, and the immune
microenvironment in the context of clinically relevant contemporary ICI-based combination therapies.
 We hypothesize that aberrant expression of ERVs is associated with improved response to ICI
combination therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, and that characterization of T cell phenotypes and the
composition and states of other infiltrating immune cells in the RCC microenvironment will improve our
understanding of the determinants of ICI response. By leveraging our unique access to clinically relevant large-
scale clinical trial specimens of single-agent ICI and ICI-based combination therapy in RCC, as well as our
collaborative team of physicians, translational researchers, and experimental biologists, we aim to systemically
assess the association of ERV expression and ICI response and to determine other immune microenvironment
features that ultimately influence response to current RCC immunotherapies. Our multidisciplinary team brings
together a collective expertise in RCC biology, pathology, and tumor immunoregulation who are dedicated to
bringing meaningful results that will optimize clinical outcomes for patients with RCC."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With increasingly effective universal antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) may now
live nearly normal lifespans. With that success however, comes a series of chronic HIV-related comorbidities,
whose mechanisms are poorly understood, but thought to be related to inflammation and immune activation.
As PLWH age, they are experiencing this high burden of non-AIDS comorbidities at younger than expected age,
including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancers, and neurocognitive and functional impairment -
leading some to suggest that HIV may both accentuate AND accelerate aging. The Women's Interagency HIV
Study (WIHS) and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) cohorts, with long-term follow up over 25 and
35 years provide the ability to measure the onset, progression and impact of HIV-related comorbid disease and
provide a platform for critically important translational studies of pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease
(CVD), human papillomavirus (HPV), aging, and HIV-disease progression. As these two highly successful and
critically important cohorts merge, the Bronx Clinical Research Site (CRS) will support the new Combined
Cohort Study (CCS) in an effort to understand and advance the study of HIV infection and its treatment, with a
focus on HIV-related comorbidities and aging with HIV. The Bronx CRS will provide scientific leadership to
the CCS in three specific areas: CVD, microbiome studies, and HPV infection and disease. In particular, the
Bronx CRS will provide innovative scientific leadership in studying CVD among PLWH with a longitudinal
echocardiography study and a high-caliber Echo Reading Center, including cutting-edge cardiovascular
imaging, and the study of CVD in relation to inflammatory markers, metabolomics, and microbiome among
PLWH. The Bronx CRS will continue to follow our large numbers of well-characterized persons living with and
without HIV, as well as recruit primarily racial and ethnic minority men and women with or at-risk for HIV to
reflect our local NYC HIV epidemic, thus allowing us to investigate the impact of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
health disparities on HIV disease progression and its relation to comorbid illnesses across the lifespan. The
value of these studies goes far beyond the United States, to inform the global HIV epidemic, and care of PLWH."

10831943,"Project Summary
The overarching objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel mechanism for sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). Our laboratory recently made the unexpected discovery that mice genetically engineered for
hyperactive stress circuits exhibit an increased incidence of SUDEP, a finding that was verified to be
translationally relevant from observed neuroendocrine abnormalities in patients that died of confirmed or
suspected SUDEP. Given that both stress and SUDEP link to disruption of central circuits responsible for the
regulation of cardiorespiratory function, we propose that exaggerated activity of central stress circuits on
downstream brainstem autonomic control centers represents a novel mechanism contributing to increased
SUDEP risk. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN) are at the apex of the stress axis and project directly to brainstem regions critical for autonomic regulation,
including the nucleus of the solitary tract (PVN-NTSCRH). PVN-NTSCRH has a well-established role in integrating
cardiorespiratory responses to stress, making them a likely driver of cardiorespiratory dysfunction related to
central stress axis hyperexcitability and, potentially, SUDEP. In fact, our preliminary data demonstrate that
chemogenetic activation of PVN-NTSCRH increases SUDEP incidence. The current application will build on the
expertise of, Drs. Jamie Maguire and Carie Boychuk, to test the hypothesis that HPA axis hyperexcitability in
chronically epileptic mice increases the risk for SUDEP through increased PVN-NTSCRH drive, exaggerating
cardiac vagal output during homeostatic challenges. We will investigate this hypothesis by examining whether
there is increased PVN-NTSCRH drive associated with SUDEP risk and whether excessive activation of this
pathway is sufficient to increase SUDEP incidence. We will interrogate potential, novel pathophysiological
mechanisms mediating the impact of hyperactive stress circuits on SUDEP risk by examining the impact on
cardiac vagal output. Finally, we will investigate whether environmental factors associated with hyperactive
stress circuits, such as chronic stress, can impact cardiac vagal function and SUDEP risk. This application has
the potential to uncover a novel mechanism contributing to SUDEP risk, which may also be relevant to other
forms of sudden death."

The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support my long-term career objective of
becoming an independent investigator who specializes in improving health behaviors and preventing chronic
disease development in high-risk groups, including aging populations and those receiving nutrition assistance.
Older adults have a higher risk of chronic disease, including several conditions strongly associated with poor
nutrition. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables has been shown to lower the risk of multiple chronic
diseases. However, very few older adults consume the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables,
especially those with limited income. While most adults in the U.S. still visit a store to buy groceries at least
once a week, online grocery shopping is rapidly expanding in popularity, including among older adults. The
growth in online grocery shopping offers a promising opportunity to tailor healthy eating interventions to online
food retail environments. However, to our knowledge, no research has evaluated interventions designed to
promote healthier online food purchases among low-income older adults. To address these gaps in the
literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to 1) develop the components of a behavioral economics
strategy (i.e., healthy bundle defaults) to influence diet behaviors; 2) characterize the online grocery shopping
behaviors and attitudes of low-income older adults nationally; and 3) examine the extent to which “healthy
bundles defaults” and other behavioral economic strategies increase fruit and vegetable purchases among low-
income adults in an online randomized controlled experiment. Data to inform the development of “healthy
bundle defaults” in Aim 1 will come from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey
(FoodAPS), a nationally representative survey of household food purchases and acquisitions, including
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households. For Aims 2 and 3, I will recruit a nationwide
nonprobability panel of 2,528 low-income adults aged >50 years through Survey Sampling International (SSI),
an online surveying company that recruits volunteer research participants through their online panels and other
online communities. The findings from the proposed research will support the development of novel and much-
needed approaches to improving food purchases in an aging population with an elevated risk of developing
nutrition-based diseases. My training goals closely parallel my research aims and will further enhance my
understanding of: 1) aging and health, 2) behavioral economics, 3) experimental research methods, and 4)
survey design and development. This training will be augmented with additional professional development
activities, including attending and presenting at national academic meetings to disseminate findings. The
project builds upon the exceptional resources and mentoring at NYU School of Medicine and other institutions
to train me in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, provide opportunities for
collaboration, and attain research independence."
10832457,"Project Summary
 Patients with prediabetes and diabetes are at an elevated risk for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
DPN primarily affects the distal limbs and is associated with pain, loss of sensation, gait abnormalities and
reduced quality of life. This renewal will focus on a dietary intervention using a ketogenic diet (KD) to prevent
and reverse symptoms of DPN. Consumption of a KD results in elevated ketone bodies, with beta-
hydroxybutyrate (bOHB) and acetoacetate as key mediators. Generated by the liver, ketone bodies can be used
directly by non-hepatic cells, such as neurons, as an alternative fuel source to glucose or in a signaling capacity.
Axon degeneration in DPN, particularly small fibers, leads to reduced epidermal innervation for which there are
currently no clinical treatments. The metabolic and energetic status of sensory axons contributes to axon loss,
and the addition of ketone bodies as a fuel source could be an important modulator of cellular energy and
metabolic function. Pain is a major contributor to decreased quality of life in patients with DPN, which is
compromised by a lack of effective clinical treatments. Our overall hypothesis is that ketone bodies improve
features of DPN through actions directly on sensory neurons. We will test our hypothesis using dietary
interventions in mouse models of prediabetes and diabetes, as well as incorporate a Cre-lox mouse model
lacking the ability to utilize ketone bodies in sensory neurons (advCre-SCOT-/- mice) to determine whether direct
effects of ketones on peripheral sensory neurons drive these beneficial effects. Aim 1 will test whether ketone
bodies act directly on sensory neurons to stimulate axon growth in DPN. Experiments will include both in vitro
and in vivo assessment of axon growth as a result of a KD, and explore cellular signaling pathways involved in
axon guidance, energy signaling pathways, and mitochondrial function. Aim 2 will test whether ketone bodies
reduce pain (mechanical allodynia) in DPN by scavenging MGO. Experiments will incorporate ex vivo
electrophysiology to identify response and firing properties of identified sensory neurons in settings of MGO and
a KD. Additional experiments will test whether a KD has similar anti-nociceptive action in a chemotherapy-
induced neuropathy model where changes in metabolism do not play a role. Results from these studies will fill
an important gap in DPN research by providing new information about how a KD can improve neuronal
metabolism and stimulate axon growth. These results will identify interventions that could be developed for pain
control in DPN, including new mechanisms related to MGO toxicity."
10832462,"Voice production is governed by the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) that occurs between the airflow coming from
the lungs and the vocal folds, which results in the self-sustained oscillation of the glottis. This vibratory motion is
characterized by opening, closing, and closed phases, and the majority of sound is produced during the mid to
latter closing. Studies have shown that a faster reduction of glottal flow rate (due to increased closing speed or
increased deceleration of the airflow velocity), also known as the maximum flow declination rate (MFDR),
determines the acoustic intensity and the amount of energy in the higher harmonics. Higher harmonics are
important for intelligibility in noise but not in quiet, a major symptom for patients with voice disorders. The glottis
is convergent during opening and divergent during closing. These alternating shapes result in an increase in
intraglottal pressure during opening and a decrease (and possibly negative) during closing, which facilitate
vibrations. Our long-term goal is to ultimately develop a method that enables detailed intraglottal volumetric flow
measurement in a vibrating tissue model of the larynx. This project will advance the method we have developed
for measuring intraglottal flow distribution in a single plane toward measuring the intraglottal volume flow
distribution in a static physical model of the larynx. The proposed work is based on recent advancements we
have made using tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomo-PIV) to capture the dynamics of the volume flow
distribution above the glottal exit11. Toward this goal, our specific aim is: 1) Develop a method for measuring
intraglottal volume flow distribution. Under this aim, we will first demonstrate the intraglottal flow measurement
technique in a static physical model of the larynx. The model's dimensions will be similar to an excised canine
larynx and its static geometry will capture the main features of divergent glottis. We expect to see differences in
the intraglottal vortices and other glottal jet features between the anterior, posterior, and the mid-membranous
aspects of the glottis. We will then validate the intraglottal volume flow measurement technique with auxiliary
flow measurements techniques. We expect to show that the intraglottal flow characteristics (e.g., mean velocity,
turbulence levels and vortical strength) will match the different measurement techniques within 10%."
10832463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although small-molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) offer potentially powerful new ways to
manipulate biological systems, several scientific barriers to their development have unfortunately limited their
use in life science research. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive SIMCat
discovery program that focuses on their development and translation from the reaction flask to living systems.
The overall objectives of this research are to 1) identify the factors that are important to obtaining fast,
selective, and biocompatible transfer hydrogenation SIMCats; and 2) create new catalytic agents for the
remediation of aldehyde overload. We are interested in SIMCats that catalyze transfer hydrogenation reactions
because they mimic important redox enzymes that are ubiquitous in all life forms. Our central hypothesis is
that these synthetic enzyme mimics could be used to neutralize toxic aldehydes in vivo so that endogenous
antioxidants, such as glutathione, are free to sequester reactive oxygen species that damage cells and tissue.
The rationale for this project is that by selectively converting toxic aldehydes to non-toxic alcohols, transfer
hydrogenation SIMCats could supplement Nature’s defense system against oxidative stress. SIMCats are
expected to be highly efficient detoxification agents due to their ability to catalyze continuous reaction
turnovers, unlike conventional aldehyde scavengers that get consumed upon each reaction. In Specific Aim 1,
a variety of half-sandwich metal complexes will be tested for their activity and the most promising candidates
will be subjected to structure-activity relationship and kinetic/thermodynamic studies to obtain chemical insights
into their catalytic behavior. In Specific Aim 2, the catalytic rates, speciation, and distribution of SIMCats inside
live cells will be determined. This aim will be accomplished by taking advantage of single-molecule super
resolution microscopy and ratiometric fluorescence imaging techniques to visualize SIMCats “in action.” In
Specific Aim 3, the ability of transfer hydrogenation SIMCats to protect neuroblastoma cells and zebrafish
against aldehyde toxicity will be evaluated. The efficacy and aldehyde selectivity of SIMCat detoxification
agents will be compared to that of conventional stoichiometric aldehyde traps. The significance of our
research is the development of synthetic methodologies that are tailored toward the discovery of novel
SIMCats, which considers not only chemical reactivity and substrate selectivity but also biocompatibility. The
innovation of our research is the application of organometallic complexes to protect cells against chemical
toxicants by exploiting their catalytic capabilities. We expect that this work will help streamline the SIMCat
discovery process and lead to new approaches to remedy aldehyde overload, which could have important
therapeutic relevance to the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases in humans."

The elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV Env is one of the major
challenges of HIV-1 vaccine development. As a vaccine component, HIV-1 Env however elicits
limited neutralizing breadth and potency in most pre-clinical and clinical studies to date. The
isolation of second generation of bNAbs from HIV-infected individuals, and characterization
of their cognate epitopes on Env, offer a tremendous opportunity for understanding the
mechanisms underlying the elicitation of bNAb responses. As one of the most functionally
conserved and accessible elements of the HIV Env, the receptor binding site, namely CD4
binding site (CD4bs), plays a crucial role for virus engagement with receptor CD4 while serves
as a vulnerable target for bNAb response in natural infections. VRC01-class bNAbs, a subset
of CD4bs bNAbs isolated from donor 45 and numerous other HIV-infected individuals strongly
supports the premise of utilizing VRC01-class bNAbs as vaccine template. However, current
Env-based immunogens are not capable of eliciting potent VRC01-class bNAb response via
vaccination. The inferred VRC01- class bNAb germline precursors (gVRC01) often display
weak or no apparent affinity to prototypical Env immunogens. Thus, immunogen modifications
including approaches for efficiently activating, selectively expanding, and precisely shepherding
bNAb germline precursors (germline targeting) are needed for CD4bs bNAb elicitation, yet met
with limited success. During the last funding period, we established a panel of Env-based
designer immunogens with desirable antigenicity for eliciting CD4bs bNAb response. In this
proposal, we aim to extend our effort by an innovative program consisting of the following
three complementary specific aims: (1) to investigate the immunogenicity of novel
immunogens/regimens in bNAb germline BCR knockin mice; (2) to investigate the
immunogenicity of novel immunogens in guinea pigs and OmniMouse2 model that carries un-
rearranged human antibody loci; and (3) to explore a novel neutralizing epitope in the C3/V4
region of the Env as potential bNAb response target. We believe that through this study we will
(i) contribute to the thorough understanding of the basic aspects of the B cell response to the
HIV-1 Env following vaccination and natural infection; and (ii) contribute new immunogens,
new vaccine target, and optimized vaccination regimens leading to improved neutralizing
responses targeting conserved Env elements."
10795670,"The stethoscope is a ubiquitous technology used to listen to sounds from the chest in order to assess lung or heart conditions. Despite its universal use, it is considered an unreliable diagnosis tool due to a number of limitations: masking by noise, need for highly trained users and ear to interpret lung sounds and subjectivity in interpreting auscultation sounds. Still, one of the reasons auscultations are a staple of clinical screening is that sound is one the cheapest, fastest and most readily available biomarkers. The simple fact of breathing involves sound traveling through chest cavities that will be affected by presence of obstructions or abnormalities. While the signature of these air flow disruptions may be concealed, the right engineering innovation should not only identify their presence but can be extended as an imaging modality to identify their location, which would be a novel use of breath sounds to image lung cavities. The proposed smart auscultation technology is innovative in three ways: (i) it develops a machine learning architecture that imposes finite-element airway propagation constraints and stochastic variational inference using recurrent neural networks, (ii) a novel piezo-sensing material with tunable acoustic impedance that matches the skin hence eliminating air as transmission medium between the chest and device diaphragm which virtually eliminates pick up of any ambient noise, (iii) an array device that leverages the piezo-sensor to develop an imaging device using passive breathing sounds (instead of radiations or ultrasound probes). The proposed technology is extremely low-cost, deployable under adverse conditions, usable for immediate clinical examination as well as extendable for monitoring as a wearable device. The new technology will be field tested directly in case/control studies at the Johns Hopkins pediatric ER and pulmonary clinics to validate localization accuracy from the auscultation array using physicians’ judgments as gold standard.  If successful, this technology will complement alternative, often costly and time-consuming diagnosis schemes (X-rays or ultrasounds which often cost $100-$1000’s) to offer a fast, cheap (few $) and accessible tool that can be widely disseminated from community clinics to hospitals and potentially home-based health monitoring. Given the dire public health need in addressing ALRI challenges, the proposed low-cost and efficient technology can be a game changer as a point-of-care aid to triage cases that require further medical attention."

 Nearly 10,000 Americans die from melanoma every year. Since 2011, immune checkpoint inhibitors have 
been approved for metastatic melanoma. These antibodies enhance a person’s immune system ability to 
recognize cancer cells. Despite a major improvement in remission rates, the majority of patients do not respond 
to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The identification of approaches to overcome immune checkpoint inhibitor 
resistance, as well as new therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic melanoma, are crucially needed. 
 Cancer cells rely on exogenous sources of methionine, contrarily to normal cells that can thrive off the 
remethylation of homocysteine. Our data shows that at levels that maintain body weight, a methionine restricted 
diet dramatically reduces tumor size and number of lung metastases in an immunocompetent murine melanoma 
model. Our preliminary data indicates that the effect involves mitochondrial function. Recent work highlighted 
the importance of mitochondrial function in immune checkpoint inhibitor responders versus nonresponders. The 
combination of methionine restriction and immune checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness has never been tested. 
In addition to direct effects on methionine dependent cancer cells, we have determined that alterations in dietary 
methionine affect the gut microbiome. It is now well-established that there are significant differences in the gut 
microbiomes of patients with metastatic melanoma that are associated with efficacy of immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy, and that responsiveness can be induced with fecal transplantation in animal models. However, 
the impact of a methionine-regulated microbiome on melanoma growth, metastasis, and immune checkpoint 
inhibitor responsiveness is unknown. 
 According to our data and supporting scientific literature, we hypothesize that dietary methionine restriction 
will promote antitumor mechanisms, including autophagy and microbiome alterations, which will increase 
immune checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness for metastatic melanoma. To test this hypothesis, we propose to 
study the effect of a methionine restricted diet in a preclinical, immunocompetent mouse model of melanoma. 
Following establishment of tumor, mice will receive a standard diet or an identical diet containing low levels of 
methionine to investigate the following: Aim 1) Determine whether methionine restriction increases 
responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade in a preclinical mouse model. Aim 2) Determine the contribution 
of gut microbiota in methionine-dependent antitumor activity. 
 Our study investigates a novel approach to decrease mortality due to metastatic melanoma. We expect the 
results generated from our studies to be translatable to other types of malignancies, especially those for which 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are used for therapy."

The Administrative core will provide leadership, oversight and scientific direction for all aspects of the DRC to
ensure it operates responsibly, effectively and efficiently. Its mission is to facilitate a scientific environment that
fosters interactive research and resource sharing between the interdisciplinary DRC investigators. The DRC
Director (Sussel) and Associate director (Reusch) will work closely with the internal and external advisory boards
to provide oversight of the individual biomedical cores to ensure they offer services that would be difficult for
single users to implement in a cost-effective manner, but would be of broad interest to the research base. In
particular, the Administrative core will work to leverage existing UC AMC research resources and/or provide new
resources, such that DRC investigators have access to the most state-of-art technologies and instrumentation,
specialized reagents and resources for diabetes research, and training, with the intention of removing barriers
that would potentially impede progress in basic and translational diabetes discoveries. The Administrative

10833183,"CLINICAL RESOURCE CORE
PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes represents a worldwide health crisis, with the incidence of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2
diabetes (T2D) steadily increasing. While autoimmunity is central to T1D, many key aspects of the disease
process are shared by T1D and T2D, including beta cell dysfunction, hyperglycemia, metabolic dysfunction and
insulin resistance. Complications of T1D and T2D also have many similarities, including cardiovascular disease
(CVD) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), both leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Center (UC AMC) is among world leaders in clinical translational investigations into
T1D and T2D across the lifespan, as well as in gestational diabetes (GDM) and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
(CFRD). Funding through the Diabetes Research Center (DRC) would capitalize on these existing
strengths and catalyze the formation of an integrated comprehensive diabetes research program.
The Clinical Resource Core (CR) of the UC Denver DRC stands at the interface of multiple institutions, programs
and individuals, all of whom are working to prevent or ameliorate the devastating long term complications of
diabetes and its high economic burden. The CR core would leverage the current clinical research facilities and
equipment available at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (BDC), UC AMC’s Clinical Translational
Research Center (CTRC), The University of Colorado Hospital, Denver Veteran’s Administration Medical Center
(VA) and Children’s Hospital Colorado. The DRC CR core would integrate diabetes research across these
institutions through communication and distribution of the resources available, and create shared sample and
data biobanks and a recruiting database of mothers, infants, children, adolescents and adults with diabetes,
diabetes risk and controls. Such integration would accelerate progress and increase the quality of diabetes
research, coalesce existing strengths and strategically focus faculty recruitment in areas of needed
growth. DRC funding would also attract new talent at postgraduate and junior faculty levels and add
unique components of infrastructure needed for discovery.
Specifically, we will improve access and collaborations for recruiting subjects, tracking data and banking tissue
samples from well-phenotyped participants with diabetes and control subjects across the lifespan; establish
collections of samples from our well-characterized subjects and facilitate the ability of DRC users to perform

No energy transfer processes are perfectly efficient. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
consists of a sequence of reactions with known nodes of inefficient energy transfer. Exercise training is known
to improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency to maximize energy output. The premise of this proposal is
to examine how cardiolipin (CL) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) modulates OXPHOS efficiency to
alter skeletal muscle and whole-body energy expenditure. CL is a cone-shaped non-bilayer lipid that induces
membrane curvature in cristae, and binds with high affinity to mitochondrial respiratory complexes to regulate
their functions. Exercise or inactivity alters muscle mitochondrial CL content, coincidental to changes in
OXPHOS efficiency. Preliminary tissue-specific gain- or loss-of-function studies suggest that reduced
mitochondrial CL diminishes OXPHOS efficiency to protect mice from diet-induced obesity. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that exercise promotes CL biosynthesis to improve OXPHOS energy efficiency.
Combining mitochondrial diagnostics, lipidomics, and metabolic phenotyping, the role of CL in energy
transduction will be examined."

 Signaling networks are crucial for the orchestration of cellular functions in response to stimuli. Knowledge
of the structure of these networks provides a basis for understanding the pathological consequences of their
malfunction and offers opportunities for designing therapeutic interventions. The complexity of these networks
and the speed with which signals are transmitted in cells makes mapping them a formidable challenge. The
typical approach for elucidating the structure of cellular signaling networks involves an iterative process of
creating signaling protein disruptions, domain mutants and site-directed mutants followed by characterization
of each mutant through a battery of cellular activation assays. As a complementary approach, modern
proteomic methods using quantitative mass spectrometry can facilitate the hypothesis-driven characterization
of signaling pathways by providing a global view of cellular phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions
through a variety of activation states.
 The Core B, Proteomics core will make cutting-edge, quantitative proteomic capabilities and computational
analysis available to the investigators of this program project. The core will provide identification and relative
quantitation of the protein composition and post-translational modification state of proteins using modern
LC/MS techniques. This core has a strong track record of fruitful collaboration with the PI's of the program
project culminating in the generation of 7 large phosphoproteomic and 8 CoIP-LCMS protein interaction
datasets and publication of collaborative papers which elucidated the molecular details of how ZAP-70 is
recruited to LAT and how the catalytic activity of ZAP-70 mediates basal signaling and negative feedback of T
cell receptor signaling. The core has recently developed new technologies for the characterization of protein
interaction networks in living cells using TurboID and the deepest possible characterization of phosphorylation
networks using Src SH2 domain Superbinder and TMT BOOST channels. These newly developed methods

10834055,"PROJECT 1 - ABSTRACT
T cells are key components of the adaptive immune system, and have evolved to detect foreign antigens and
generate a response that protects the host from intracellular pathogens and malignancies. The activation of the
T cell receptor (TCR) results in the initiation of signal transduction pathways inside the T cell that generate the
appropriate antigen-triggered responses. The major goals of the Program Project are to understand how the
distinct features of the molecules and cellular circuitry in T cells allows for tonic signaling to self-pMHC, while
also establishing a stimulus threshold, which when overcome results in robust signaling to agonists. In Project
1 we focus on the tyrosine kinases activated by the TCR, to understand the distinct properties of these signaling
molecules, differentiating them from similar proteins operative in B cells. Our strategy is to use focused
biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological studies on kinase variants and particular functions, combined with
high-throughput methods for determining the fitness of variant proteins in supporting signal-transduction
functions in T cells, as contrasted to B cells.
The activation of intracellular signaling pathways by the TCR is mediated by three kinds of tyrosine kinases,
which are members of the Src, Syk, and Tec families. Although they share features of their signaling machinery
with other cells of the hematopoietic lineage, TCRs utilize a distinct set of members of these tyrosine kinase
families (i.e., Lck, ZAP-70 and Itk), interact with unique MHC binding co-receptors (i.e., CD4 and CD8 with Lck)
and phosphorylate unique scaffold proteins (e.g., LAT and SLP-76 for ZAP-70 and Itk) that couple to downstream
signaling pathways. These components evolved contemporaneously with the MHC genes, and have maintained
features in their sequences that mark them as distinct throughout the vertebrate evolutionary tree. A principal
goal of Project 1 is to understand the functional specializations that have optimized these kinases for their roles
in T cells.
Project 1 has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the specialized properties of the Src-family kinase Lck
that are optimized for T cell function. These studies will include single-molecule tracking of Lck and variants to
monitor their activation and localization, as well as structural studies on the interaction between Lck and the
phosphatase CD45. In Aim 2 we will study the differentiation of ZAP-70 and Syk in T cells and B cells, by focusing
on aspects of the activation of these kinases that differ in B cells and T cells. In Aim 3 we study the specialized
differences in the activation mechanisms of Tec kinases, leading to different behavior on the membrane of Itk
and Btk, which are the Tec kinases operative in T cells and B cells, respectively. Together, these studies will
illuminate evolutionary pressures that have molded specialized responses from Lck, ZAP-70 and Itk, providing
a framework for the development of T cell-specific drugs."
10834058,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 2
T lymphocytes (T cells) play a key role in orchestrating an adaptive immune response to infectious pathogens
as well as cancer cells. T cells express T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that respond specifically to MHC-
associated antigenic peptides (pMHC) derived from pathogens or mutant self-proteins of cancer cells. Upon TCR
engagement with such agonist pMHC, intracellular signaling ensues, ultimately leading to new gene transcription
programs required for T cell activation. In the homeostatic state in vivo, naïve T cells require shorter duration
TCR engagement with self-pMHC to produce tonic signaling events that are required for their survival and
homoeostasis. However, these tonic signals do not lead to cell activation as that would result in
immunopathology. The half-life differences between ligands that induce tonic signals and agonists are not large.
Kinetic proofreading is considered to be the conceptual framework for understanding the fine specificity with
which the TCR signaling pathway discriminates between ligands. In spite of much progress in understanding
membrane-proximal TCR signaling and ligand discrimination, how the tonic survival signals qualitatively or
quantitatively differ from activation signals is not completely known. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize
that TCR signaling events resulting from interactions with self-pMHC and agonist-pMHC differ because of
feedback regulatory mechanisms superimposed on kinetic proofreading both proximally and distally from the
TCR. We propose to determine the mechanisms underlying such feedback regulation and their impact on ligand
discrimination by bringing together computational modeling, biochemistry, mouse models, and single molecule
experiments in live cells and reconstituted systems. We will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will define
negative feedback loops and where they act to regulate ligand discrimination. Our preliminary modeling
studies have predicted that that negative feedback, proximal but not distal to the TCR, is important for dampening
noise and inappropriate responses to self-pMHC. We will explore the involvement of 3 proximal negative
feedback loops. Synergistic computational and experimental studies are expected to identify the sources, nodes
of action, and impact of these negative feedback loops on ligand discrimination. In Aim 2, we will determine
the mechanisms underlying the formation of the LAT condensate and its role in positive regulatory
feedback. Our modeling studies suggest that positive feedback regulation distal from the receptor, but still
responsive to TCR-pMHC dwell time, is important for a robust response to stimulation by agonists. Our
preliminary experimental data reveal that LAT, a key regulator of TCR signaling, forms discrete condensates in
response to individual TCR-pMHC binding events. By combining statistical physics-based modeling with
experiments, we will dissect the mechanism of LAT condensation nucleation and its dependence on TCR-pMHC
binding dwell time, and the role of LAT condensation in mediating positive feedback regulation via SOS-catalyzed
Ras activation. The work proposed in this project bridges studies to be conducted in Projects 1, 3 and 4."
10834060,"ABSTRACT - Project 3
A healthy immune system depends on T cells’ abilities to detect foreign agonist pMHC molecules, at near single
molecule levels, among vast numbers of sometimes very similar self-antigens. While the T cell’s fine
discrimination capabilities are experimentally well established, understanding how the molecular machinery of
the TCR signaling system achieves this is far from transparent. Fundamental issues of noise, variation, and
signal fidelity present serious challenges—both for understanding how the T cell works as well as for
development of therapeutic strategies utilizing T cells. Recently, a class of phenomena known as protein
condensation phase transitions have begun to emerge in biology. Originally identified in the context of nuclear
organization and gene expression, a distinct two-dimensional protein condensation on the cell membrane has
now been discovered in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling system involving the scaffold protein LAT. While the
role of LAT as a scaffold for the clustering of downstream signaling molecules in T cells has long been
recognized, experimental realization that this structure can form through distinct types of phase transition
processes is more recent. Protein condensation phase transitions can exhibit a wide range of properties that
differ substantially from more linear molecular clustering processes, and thus offer a variety of different ways to
regulate the functional output of molecular signaling systems. Project 3 addresses the overarching
hypothesis that unique properties of the LAT protein condensation phase transition enable the
remarkable sensitivity and selectivity T cells exhibit during antigen recognition. We propose a series of
investigations to test aspects of this hypothesis that combine highly quantitative experiments in reconstituted
molecular systems with precision single-molecule live cell experiments in primary T cells. We have preliminary
data indicating that LAT condensation in live T cells is controlled by an unusual type of kinetic phase transition
and that specific molecular features of proximal TCR signaling are tuned to take advantage of this. Confirmation
and elucidation of this discovery will form the foundation of our more detailed investigation into the role of the
phase transition in TCR signaling. While Projects 1 and 2 focus on proximal signaling feedback mechanisms
leading up to LAT phosphorylation and condensate nucleation, and Project 4 examines signaling downstream
from the LAT condensate, Project 3 emphasizes experimental and computational characterization of the LAT
condensation phase transition itself and measurements of how its properties modulate downstream signal
propagation through the following specific aims: 1. Define the factors controlling initiation of LAT
condensation in T cells; 2. Engineer non-condensing LAT and LAT-like systems; 3. Define how LAT
condensates control downstream signaling to Ras and Ca2+ pathways. Insights originating from this work
will likely resolve some conceptual mysteries on mechanistic function of the T cell receptor signaling pathway
and highlight alternative angles to engineer and manipulate T cells for therapeutic benefit."
10834063,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 4
 T cells demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to activating TCR signals triggered by agonist pMHC
recognition. These signals elicit T cell activation as well as differentiation in effector T cell subsets to coordinate
immune protection to different pathogens, but the molecular basis for specific and dependable discrimination
and mechanistic regulation of T cell commitment (kinetic proofreading) are not understood. How the
discrimination between activating TCR signals triggered by agonist pMHC recognition versus self-pMHC
encounters occurs at a mechanistic level will be investigated in Projects 1-3, with focus on the proximal kinase
network, proofreading mechanisms through feedback loops, and LAT condensation characteristics. How the
TCR pathway converts incoming signals as a function of agonist pMHC recognition or self-pMHC encounters
and processes this information into instructive Effector Kinase Signals that control T cell activation and
differentiation will be investigated in Project 4.
 In Project 4, we will test our hypothesis that - downstream of the LAT signalosome - Effector Kinase
Signals triggered by two Ras Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (RasGEFs), SOS1 and RasGRP1 regulate
controlled and balanced T cell activation and differentiation. Specifically, we propose that agonist pMHC
recognition triggers the collective output of multiple RasGEF-Effector Kinase Signals that drive T cell activation
and proliferation in a failsafe and efficient manner. Unique nuances in the RasGEF-Effector Kinase effector
signals further influence development into effector T cell subsets, like regulatory T cells. By contrast, we propose
that contacts with self-pMHC do not trigger the same RasGEF signals, but instead, convert self-pMHC induced
sub-threshold, tonic signals into unique RasGEF signals that promote T cell survival and homeostasis. In Aim
1, we will Investigate RasGEF substrates and partner molecules in canonical and non-canonical pathways. In
Aim 2, we will assess tonic RasGRP1-mTOR signals and in vivo relevance in T cells. In Aim 3, we will establish
the functional significance of digital SOS1-Ras-ERK signaling in T cells and regulated immunity. In Aim 4, we
will decipher non-canonical SOS1-P38 signaling in regulatory T cells and tumor immunity.
 Our past and ongoing, collaborative efforts and seminal discoveries on two Ras Guanine nucleotide
Exchange Factors (RasGEFs), SOS and RasGRP, their canonical signals to Ras/MAPK pathways, their
unexpected non-canonical signals to mTOR and P38- kinase pathways, and innovative technologies form the
foundation for the four Aims of Project 4 in this revised P01 renewal. The Kuriyan-, Groves-, Salomon-, and
Roose- teams are poised to address the major questions in T cell biology described in Project 4. Together, these
studies will provide critical results how the TCR pathway converts incoming signals (Projects 1-3) into instructive
signals (Project 4) that control T cell activation and differentiation. We anticipate that results from these studies
will provide novel insights relevant to human autoimmune diseases and cancer immunology."
10834108,"TR&D 1: GENERATING DIFFERENTIAL AND DYNAMIC NETWORKS – PROJECT SUMMARY
Biological systems are incredibly diverse and dynamic, with hundreds of known cell types and states in a
complex multicellular organism such as human. In contrast, molecular network and pathway maps typically
show a single static view of all interactions for an organism, largely because of cost and technical limitations of
gene and protein interaction mapping technologies. Recently, a range of breakthrough experimental advances
is enabling networks to be mapped at much higher coverage and finer resolution in space and time than
previously possible. New mass spectrometry technology can capture comprehensive changes in protein
expression and phosphorylation at lower cost and higher speed, enabling measurement of differential network
expression information in clinical samples and other contexts. Single-cell genomics, including single-cell
RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), now achieves high resolution measurements of transcriptional state on a per cell basis
over multiple time points. Finally, new high-resolution mass spectrometry workflows enable comprehensive
interactome mapping in a sample at multiple time points and with spatial resolution across a tissue or within
different cellular compartments.
In this TR&D, we develop new computational technologies that take advantage of these qualitatively new data
types to better understand and quantitatively model how networks function in differential biological conditions
and to infer whole-cell dynamic network models. The goals of these technologies are to [​Aim 1] capture the
molecular information flow from targeted perturbations to downstream cellular responses in fully data-driven
predictive dynamic network models; [​Aim 2] functionally characterize mechanisms defining individual cell types
and model the dynamics of developmental lineages; and [​Aim 3] visualize, analyze and predictively model
differential changes in protein interactions across biological contexts, such as disease versus normal. Our
technology research and development aims are motivated by a range of Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs),
including global mapping of protein interactions (DBPs 1-2,5) and single cell biology focused on understanding
tissue development with engineering applications in regenerative medicine (DBPs 6,7). These aims will be
supported by Technology Partnerships that will help us use gene function information from biological
ontologies and databases (TPs 1,3) and scRNA-seq data portals (TP 5) to characterize differential and
dynamic networks of cells, tissues and disease states.

10834111,"TR&D 2: MODELING MULTI-SCALE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE – PROJECT SUMMARY
In this Technology Research and Development (TR&D) component, we advance methods to transition Network
Biology from flat diagrams of nodes and edges towards multi-scale models of biological systems. Although
current network models and layouts provide a useful summary of an interaction data set, these visualizations
do not capture the exquisite multi-scale hierarchy of modular components and subcomponents that underlie
many biological systems – from amino acids to proteins to protein complexes to biological processes to
organelles, cells, and tissues. We recently demonstrated that detailed hierarchical information is embedded in,
and systematically revealed by, biological network data. This discovery enabled us to reconstruct and extend
the Gene Ontology hierarchy, yielding a GO based directly on molecular data (Data-Driven Ontologies) rather
than literature. Here we seek to significantly increase the sensitivity and scalability of algorithms for detection
of hierarchical network structure [Aim 1] and our ability to integrate many different lines of network evidence in
building these hierarchies [Aim 2]. We also aim to broaden and generalize the concepts of hierarchical network
analysis to study biological structure at the larger scales of cell populations and tissues [Aim 3]. Methods
development is driven by an array of exciting Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) for which hierarchical
modeling is a major need. These projects include large-scale mapping of human protein interactions with
collaborators Krogan, Emili and Vidal (DBPs 1-3); genetic interaction mapping in yeast and human cell-cycle
control pathways with Boone and Bienkowska (DBPs 4,11); regenerative medicine studies in multiple tissues
(MedByDesign, DBP 6); and studies of cardiac tissue and its development (Chi, DBP 7). These efforts also
invoke significant Technology Partnerships (TPs) with developers of biological ontologies and databases of
gene function (Morris, Mungall, Mesirov, TPs 1-3) as well as experts in algorithms for network community
detection (Fortunato, TP 4). Finally, underlying all of the above aims is the development of significant new
software tools and services to enable a broad range of researchers to build, access and use biological systems
hierarchies. Smart user interfaces (UIs) and services will be made available via a growing NRNB software
ecosystem, including Cytoscape, NDEx, the Data-Driven Ontology Toolkit (DDOT), and the HiView Lens UI for
hierarchy visualization and exploration.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes a life-threatening tick-borne disease in humans.
The disease presents as a severe form of hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of 10–40%. CCHFV
outbreaks have spanned a wide geographic area ranging from Western and Central Asia, the Middle East,
Africa and Southern Europe. Increasing global temperatures, migratory birds, and the international livestock
trade have all potentially contributed toward the spread of Hyalomma ticks—the primary vector for CCHFV.
Expanding endemic zones, widespread morbidity and significant mortality make CCHFV an acute threat to
public health and thus is listed as a NIAID Category A priority pathogen. The viral genome encodes a
glycoprotein precursor that is processed into two structural glycoproteins—Gn and Gc—and two secreted
glycoproteins—a mucin-like domain and GP38. Protective antibodies have been isolated that target Gc or
GP38, suggesting that these two proteins should be given priority for vaccine development. Here we
propose to engineer Gc- and GP38-based immunogens that focus the immune response onto broadly
conserved epitopes that are capable of eliciting protective antibody responses. To accomplish our goal, we
will structurally characterize CCHFV glycoproteins and their interactions with human-derived antibodies,
rationally engineer vaccine antigens based in part on the structural information, and characterize the
immune responses elicited by these antigens in animal models. These results will be used to guide further
improvements of the immunogens, including display on self-assembling multi-valent nanoparticles, and the
most promising candidates will be evaluated in a lethal murine model of CCHFV challenge. Given our
expertise, unique reagents, and preliminary data, we are confident that we can deliver a state-of-the-art
subunit vaccine candidate with the potential to induce cross-reactive protective antibodies, thereby
satisfying an unmet need against this NIAID Category A tick-borne pathogen."
10839376,"Project Summary/Abstract
Large segments of current US middle-aged adults are suffering and doing more poorly than earlier-born
cohorts43,65. These trends are distinct to the US. Several studies have documented that compared to Asian and
European nations, US middle-aged adults exhibit higher rates of disability and chronic illness than same-aged
peers6,10,73. Despite known differences between the US and other nations, little research has examined the
mechanisms underlying diversity in midlife development and individual-level characteristics that either magnify
or mitigate differences. Our objective is to use the HRS family of studies to identify the intergenerational,
financial, and health behavior mechanisms driving diversity in midlife development and whether they differ
across individual-level characteristics that span socio-demographics (i.e., education, gender, and race) and
psychosocial resources (i.e., social support and control beliefs). Our specific aims are: (1) describe similarities
and differences in midlife development of health, well-being, and cognition across multiple nations; (2)
investigate the intergenerational, financial, and health behavior mechanisms driving diversity in midlife
development; and (3) to examine the role of individual-level characteristics that moderate diversity in midlife
development. To address our research questions, multilevel models will be applied to harmonized longitudinal
data (collected from early 1990s to present day) from 17 nations across North America, Asia, and Europe.
Each dataset contains national samples that are repeatedly assessed on interdisciplinary outcomes. The
achievable outcome of Aim 1 is to comprehensively examine similarities and differences between the US
trends and those obtained for other high-income nations. For Aim 2, we draw from the research team's
conceptual and empirical research55,61 to investigate whether changing intergenerational relationships,
increased financial vulnerabilities and a shrinking health behavior safety net are driving diversity in midlife
development within- and between-nations. For Aim 3, we will target key questions of diversity by identifying
population segments within and across nations who are most vulnerable and identify malleable protective
resources to promote better positive midlife development. This project will provide novel insights into identifying
the intergenerational, financial, and health behavior mechanisms underlying diversity in midlife development
and whether they are operating similarly across nations with different policy contexts. For example, in nations
with less comprehensive health care, such as the US, health behavior factors could be a driving force as
opposed to nations with a national health care system. Similarly, we will uncover whether greater
intergenerational dependency in the form of increased contact and financial transfers are a more potent
mechanism in nations with less encompassing family and work policies. Findings from our project will also
shed light on factors that can promote resilient outcomes and inform future prevention and intervention efforts."

Increasing evidence suggests that early life and reproductive events, including specific pregnancy
complications, predict future health risks including cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia,
hypertension, obesity), clinical CVD events, and obstructive lung disease. Similarly, increasing evidence
suggests that exposures during pregnancy may affect offspring’s cardiovascular and lung health throughout
life. In this application, we propose to strengthen the infrastructure necessary to collect data on traditional and
emerging risk factors for heart and lung diseases and to document the occurrence of these conditions within
three related cohorts: the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS-II), the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3), and the
Growing Up Today Study (GUTS). These cohorts collectively follow 188,698 individuals including more than
14,000 minority participants with large numbers of African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The cohorts
also follow more than 65,000 mother-adult offspring pairs, over 13,000 grandmother-mother-adult child triads
and over 16,000 sib-groups; resources that facilitate research aimed at identifying inter-generational risk
factors for CVD and obstructive lung diseases. Women in the two younger cohorts (NHS3 and GUTS) are in
the middle of the reproductive years, resulting in the accrual of approximately 1,000 new pregnancies per year.
Furthermore, study participants are broadly distributed across the United States, giving us the ability to
address questions regarding rural populations including areas considered to be Frontier. The proposed
infrastructure activities in these three related cohorts will ultimately support research aimed at identifying
intergenerational and early life risk factors for CVD (CHD, stroke) and obstructive lung disease (COPD and
asthma), as well as of relevant biologic intermediate endpoints, from genes to geography. We will focus our
efforts in four areas: 1) the maximization of existing resources – including updating and maintenance of food
composition databases and geographically-linked exposure data based on geographical information systems
(GIS), 2) the collection of biological specimens tied to an in-person collection of blood pressure and
anthropometric data, 3) the expansion of web-based mobile technology and “Big Data” capabilities for the
cohorts, and 4) strengthening our capability for data sharing. The ability to combine biomarker data, state-of-
the-art mobile high-resolution measures, and traditional epidemiologic risk factor data, collected across
generations and throughout the life-course in three related cohorts will enable us and others to conduct
powerful etiologic and translational research. Our goal is to maintain the quality of follow-up and associated
data, as well as to broaden the technologies that would provide innovative dimensions to the cohort for novel
scientific discovery."

10839480,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A myriad of human mucosal diseases are intimately connected with the ecology of the flora residing at
disease sites. The etiology of these complex polymicrobial diseases is poorly described by Koch's
Postulates and the key mechanisms of polymicrobial pathogenesis are still emerging in the field. The
limited utility of traditional antibiotic therapies as well as our inadequate understanding of polymicrobial
disease etiology are both currently significant hurdles for the effective treatment of these diseases. The
thematic basis for the current proposal is to utilize genetically tractable members of the oral flora as a
model system to investigate the mechanistic and regulatory foundations of polymicrobial synergy as
well as potential mechanisms to counteract synergistic pathogenesis in these types of diseases. The
proposed research program will consist of 3 conceptually complementary research foci: 1) the genetic
control of virulence, 2) mechanisms of polymicrobial synergy, and 3) novel strategies for targeted
inhibition of bacteria. Success in each of these focus areas will be leveraged by our established
strengths in oral bacterial genetics and the application of a state-of-the-art genetic system. We are
proposing to further develop Streptococcus mutans as a preeminent model organism for genetic
studies of flora pathobiology, while also developing a new model system of polymicrobial synergy using
abscess clinical isolates of Anginosus group streptococci in combination with abscess clinical isolates
of Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella spp. The Anginosus streptococci are vastly understudied
members of the oral flora strongly associated with the formation of severe polymicrobial abscesses in
the oral cavity and throughout the body. Such abscesses are surprisingly common, yet little is known
about the pathogenic mechanisms involved, other than the essential role of polymicrobial synergy,
especially with Fusobacterium and Prevotella species. Thus, we envision utilizing the long-term support
provided by the R35 mechanism to both augment our existing programmatic strengths and also to grow
our research program in an understudied area of major clinical significance."
10839483,"Abstract
Activity in the β-frequency band (15-29Hz) is a highly prominent feature of neural recordings found across
species, recording techniques, and spatial scales. Changes in β-activity are particularly prominent during motor
processes. Movement-related β-activity can be observed in the cortical areas of the pyramidal motor system, as
well as in the subcortical areas of the extrapyramidal motor system. Pathological β-activity is a hallmark of
movement disorders, most prominently of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Indeed, β-activity is used both as a
neurophysiological marker of disease progression in PD and as a target in newly developed, cutting-edge
treatment methods such as closed-loop adaptive neurostimulation.
However, recent studies in non-human animals have cast a fundamental layer of doubt on the nature of this
neural signal and its relationship to behavior. Past studies of β-activity have focused on averaged changes of
signal-power across time (or across trials of a task), as is typical in neurophysiological studies. What recent
studies have shown, however, is that unaveraged β-band activity is not characterized by the type of steady
(de)synchronizations of activity that are found in the average. Instead, β is characterized by short, transient,
burst-like `events'. The burst-like nature of this signal, however, is lost in the average – and along with it, the
systematic relationships that can be found between dynamics of these β-burst events and motor control on
individual trials. Therefore, there is a critical need to investigate how burst-like β-events relate to both normal
and pathological motor control in humans.
We here propose a detailed, systematic investigation of this relationship. In an extensive pilot investigation, we
have found that both human movement initiation and movement cancellation are accompanied by highly specific
and systematic patterns of non-invasively recorded β-bursts. This suggests the overarching hypothesis that β-
bursts are a universal signature that signify inhibitory processes in the motor system. The work in this grant
proposal aims to systematically test this guiding hypothesis by linking specific patterns of β-bursts to established
theoretical models of motor inhibition in the human brain, by investigating the origins of movement-related β-
bursts in both cortical and subcortical regions that constitute the human motor system, and by providing causal
evidence for the role of β-bursts in conveying inhibitory motor control commands across the motor system."

The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-
designated Cancer Center headquartered in the District of Columbia (DC). LCCC was established 52 years ago
by Georgetown University (GU) to impact the cancer burden in a highly diverse and disadvantaged catchment
area (CA) through high-impact cancer research. In 1974, LCCC first received comprehensiveness status and in
2019 realized Consortium status with the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health
(HMH). LCCC’s vision is to impact our diverse CA, the nation, and beyond by pushing scientific knowledge,
creativity, and application; serving all with compassion, equity and respect; and preparing individuals who will
devote themselves to reducing the severity of cancer on the individual, family, and community through improved
access to care. Louis Weiner, MD, a leading medical oncologist and translational scientist with expertise in
immuno-oncology, has led LCCC since 2008. During the project period, Weiner led the development of a
visionary Strategic Plan for the Consortium that emphasizes transdisciplinary collaboration and community
impact around five unifying themes: (1) Translation; (2) Health Disparities and Community Engagement; (3)
Leadership in Clinical Research and Clinical Care; (4) Signature Training and Education; and (5) Organization,
Resources and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. LCCC also (1) received unprecedented financial investments and
commitments from GU, HMH and MedStar Health, its academic medical center partner; (2) appointed 5 new
Associate Directors and 6 Program Co-Leaders, increasing leadership diversity across the Consortium; (3)
infused additional funding and expanded efforts in Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), Cancer
Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI); (4) increased
the diversity of its membership, committees, leadership and other forms of representation; (5) reviewed and
enhanced CCSG Programs and Shared Resources for greater scientific impact; and (6) promoted
transdisciplinary collaboration and bidirectional engagement of the communities we serve. LCCC successfully
executed a multi-year recruitment effort to increase Cancer Focus and research depth across the Consortium,
while applying more rigorous methods to ensure cancer relevance; and expanded clinical trials capabilities
including investigator-initiated trials across the Consortium. LCCC’s 109 members have a total of $38.7M in
annual cancer-focused funding, of which $21.9M is peer-reviewed, including $13.8M (63%) from NCI, $6.4M
(29%) from other National Institutes of Health (NIH) agencies, and $1.7M (8%) from other peer-reviewed sources.
This represents a 61% increase in peer-reviewed funding and a 41% increase in NCI funding over the prior
project period. LCCC Members published 975 peer-reviewed papers in the first 4 years of the current project
period, of which 29% were high-impact (≥10). During the project period 5783 patients have accrued (through
12/31/22) to interventional trials."
10849002,"ADMINISTRATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
Administration, led by the Associate Director for Administration and Planning (ADAP), Sharon Levy, supports

FTEs, provides support to the Consortium comprising Georgetown University (GU), based in Washington,
DC and the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH), which is
headquartered in NJ. Supporting three Research Programs, nine Shared Resources, and 109 members
focused on basic, translational, clinical, and population-based cancer research, Administration manages an
annual operating budget of $73.3M that includes $21.9M (ADC) in cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding,
$16.9M ADC in other grants and contracts, and an annual institutional budget of $34.5M as well as a separate
$129.82M in institutional investments from GU, MedStar Health (MH), and HMH for Consortium-related
activities. Institutional investments are deployed at the Director’s discretion, ensuring that investments are
aligned with LCCC’s strategic plan. Levy assumed leadership of the administrative team in October 2020
when she was promoted from CCSG Administrator to ADAP. Under Levy’s guidance, Administration has
considerably expanded its role in overseeing consortium administrative operations at all sites. This required
development and implementation of robust processes to foster science across the DC and NJ campuses
including revised membership criteria and technology investments to build out infrastructure across the
Consortium (OnCore, Idea Elan, Shiny App grants database). Administration has fostered research program
restructuring, development and expansion of Community Outreach and Engagement, Cancer Research
Training and Education, clinical research infrastructure, and establishment of the new Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion office supporting the Plan to Enhance Diversity. These changes have resulted in a 61% increase in
cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding, the recruitment and onboarding of 30 peer-review–funded faculty
members, expansion of shared resource usage across the consortium with a high satisfaction rate, and a
new 2021-2026 Strategic Plan."

collaboratively expanded training and career development programs. These include: (1) implementing the
evidence-based “Entering Mentoring” curricula to support best practices in mentoring and career development,
(2) creating “Diversity in Cancer Research” internship and career development program for underrepresented
minority (URM) undergraduates funded by the American Cancer Society, (3) creating a “Young Scholars
Program” for catchment area (CA) elementary school students to be introduced to cancer research, (4) receipt
of two new T32s and nine new K awards, and (5) creating tailored oncology research fellowships for medical
students. CRTEC has three Specific Aims, each focused on a specific phase of the training and career
development pipeline, and all are guided by the CRTEC Advisory Council using a robust process to evaluate
and optimize program efficacy and impact. Aim 1 develops and supports programs that encourage K-12 and
undergraduate students to explore careers in cancer research. Aim 2 enhances the multidisciplinary cancer
research training environment for graduate and medical students, residents, postdoctoral and clinical fellows.
Aim 3 provides a strong mentoring and career development structure for early to new midcareer faculty. During
the current funding period, LCCC has provided cancer training, education, and career development for 181 K-
12 and undergraduates, 94 PhD, MD, and MD/PhD students, 70 postdoctoral and 42 clinical fellows, and 42
early career faculty of which 23% are URM. Plans for the next project period include: (1) collaborate with COE
and DEI to develop signature training programs that better serve students in our CA, (2) increase grant-funded
training and career development opportunities for clinical investigators, and (3) recruit, support, and retain early
career URM faculty in cancer research."

Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center’s (LCCC) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Plan aims
to evaluate, develop, and implement strategies to enhance and promote equitable participation, inclusion, and
leadership of individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in cancer research. The overall vision of the LCCC
DEI Plan is to create and sustain diversity within a culture of equity and inclusive excellence. LCCC will
implement and evaluate strategies to (1) increase diversity of trainees, Members, and the research workforce,
(2) enhance equitable participation, and (3) promote inclusion and leadership by individuals from backgrounds
underrepresented in research. LCCC DEI builds on a strong history of attention to social justice and diversity,
equity, and inclusion within Georgetown University (GU) and has aligned the DEI specific aims with values held
across the Consortium. Guided by The Foundational Principles of Inclusive Excellence framework from the
Association of American Medical Colleges, the LCCC DEI goals will be accomplished through three specific
aims. Aim 1: Collect and evaluate diversity metrics and improve infrastructure to recruit, retain, and track trainees
and Members from groups underrepresented in science and cancer research. DEI has established and will
continue to track metrics and support recruitment of diverse Members and trainees with ongoing input from the
LCCC DEI Advisory Council. The DEI Office will collaborate closely with the Cancer Research Training and
Education Coordination (CRTEC) Office for tracking metrics, including demographics (gender, race, ethnicity,
ability), among trainees and Members participating in cancer research. DEI has reviewed and implemented best
practices and policies for recruitment and equity in the hiring of women and individuals underrepresented in
cancer research. Aim 2: Foster a culture of inclusion and active participation in cancer research for women and
individuals from groups underrepresented in research to retain talent and advance professional careers for all.

Health (JTCC/HMH) through fellowship programs focused on cancer research. Among Members, activities will
support professional development and foster a sense of inclusion through peer groups, pilot research support,
and seed funding focused on diversity, equity, and anti-racism. DEI will recognize efforts through annual awards
for Members, staff, and students. Aim 3: Support intentional leadership development and advancement by
women and individuals underrepresented in research. LCCC’s DEI will identify and provide opportunities that
promote leadership development, including leadership training and professional coaching open to LCCC
Members across rank and track. DEI will provide professional development to current leaders in terms of
expanding inclusive leadership practices and sustaining an inclusive culture."
10849005,"CANCER HOST INTERACTIONS: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cancer Host Interactions Program (CHI) aims to identify: (1) cancer-host interactions in the tumor
microenvironment (TME), and host that promote cancer progression; (2) immune cell regulatory mechanisms
relevant to anticancer immunity and treatment; (3) novel therapies to overcome resistance caused by CHI. The
2021-2026 LCCC Strategic Plan led to the emergence of the CHI program. The CHI Program Aims nucleate
existing LCCC abilities and those of new recruits. Led by Co-Leaders, Yi Zhang, MD, PhD and Joyce Slingerland,
MD, PhD, CHI has 39 Members from eight departments at Georgetown University (GU) and the John Theurer
Cancer Center (JTCC) at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) in NJ, spanning all academic ranks, with 62% (24)
Full, 20% (8) Associate, and 18% (7) Assistant Professors. CHI arose from the prior Breast Cancer and
Experimental Therapeutics Programs and reflects new directions and recent recruits, including both Program
Co-Leaders. 13 new Members, including six based at LCCC/HMH, joined LCCC in this grant cycle to increase
scientific depth across the Consortium. CHI Members use all Shared Resources. This strongly translational
Program includes 15 physician scientists. Disease focused research in breast, lung, hepatocellular, and other
gastrointestinal cancers addresses Catchment Area (CA) needs prioritized by Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) and communicated by the COE liaison. CHI Members led 45 investigator-initiated trials (IITs)
this grant period, including 18 currently open IITs (10 therapeutic, 1 non-therapeutic, 7 non-interventional non-
therapeutic). Most IITs arose from LCCC science and all were supported by the LCCC Clinical Protocol and Data
Management (CPDM). LCCC seed funding enabled six early-stage faculty to acquire seven new ACS, DOD,
and NIH R01, R00, and R37 grants. Major accomplishments in Aim 1 include identification of metabolic,
estrogenic, and signaling mechanisms whereby cancer cells interact with fibroblasts, adipocytes and immune
cells in the TME to oppose antitumor immunity and drive metastasis. Aim 2 investigators have identified novel
epigenetic and transcriptional programs that regulate T memory stem cell abundance and plasticity, NK cell
immunity, macrophage polarization, and cytokine effects on tumor immune surveillance. Findings from CHI
science of Aims 1 and 2 have generated hypothesis-driven therapeutic trials of Aim 3, exemplified by a Phase II
trial of a novel immunotherapy approach in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CHI Members hold $5.8M in cancer-
focused, peer-reviewed funding (ADC), with $2.3M from NCI and $3.5M from NIH and other peer-reviewed
sources, and $0.5M in Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) research support.
Members authored 428 cancer-relevant publications, of which 18% were intra-programmatic, 20% inter-
programmatic, and 67% inter-NCI-designated Cancer Center collaborations. Forty percent (41%) were in high-
impact journals (IF ≥ 10). Future plans will strengthen studies linking obesity, cancer-microbe interactions, and
immune evasion and expand capacity in DC for cellular therapies."
10849006,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The scientific goals of the Cancer Prevention and Control Program (CPC) are to help alleviate the burden of
cancer by elucidating the biobehavioral underpinnings of cancer risk and response, motivating lifestyle and
associated changes, and informing cancer care delivery and policy. Research falls under three integrated
Specific Aims: (1) identifying risks associated with cancer causation and progression; (2) intervening to improve
cancer outcomes and promote survivorship; and (3) conducting health services research to advise cancer
practice and policy. This programmatic work addresses molecular and social determinants of health, and
eradicates disparities and cancers highly prevalent within the Catchment Area, including screening-eligible
cancers. CPC is co-led by Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, APRN, Laura Rozek, PhD, and Kenneth Tercyak, PhD, with
complementary expertise in clinical science, molecular epidemiology, and health behaviors and outcomes. The
recruitment of Carter-Bawa and Rozek to CPC's leadership structure provides additional depth and strength in
translating interventions to populations, and new opportunities for inter-programmatic partnerships with basic
and clinical scientists. CPC includes 33 Members across 10 departments: 17 of these Members (52%) were
recruited (13 strategically with 12 external, 1 internal) to the Program in the current cycle, with attention to gender,
racial, and ethnic diversity. During the reporting period, CPC benefited from $17M+ in strategic investments to
extend its research portfolio. Georgetown University invested an additional $1M in physical space for the
Program in Washington, DC. Hackensack Meridian Health invested an additional $3M in 6,000 sq/ft of new
research space for the Program in Nutley, NJ. In April 2023, CPC holds $7.5M in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed
funding, of which $5.6M (75%) is from NCI, $1.4M (19%) is from other NIH sources, and $0.5M (6%) derives
from additional peer-reviewed agencies. CPC's total peer-reviewed funding is $7.5M (23% over 2018). Scientific
leadership roles this cycle include 17 multi-PI grants, an FDA/NIH center for tobacco regulatory science, two NCI
Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network teams, a minority/underserved Community Oncology
Research Program grant, and six training-related grants (including a new NCI T32 in cancer population science)
that enrich the overall mission and climate of the cancer center. In the current project period, CPC authored 348
cancer-relevant publications, of which 118 (34%) were intra-programmatic, 52 (15%) were inter-programmatic,
and 12% were in high-impact (IF≥10) journals. CPC's influence has grown with the expansion of its leadership
structure across the LCCC cancer research Consortium, the recruitment of highly talented and diverse early-
stage and established faculty, a successful training program, and a substantial funding base. These
transformations are accelerating the tempo of programmatic and interactive scientific discoveries, and deepen
research impact in the Catchment Area. Moreover, they are driving LCCC’s ability to prevent and reduce cancer,
enhance cancer survivors’ quality of life, and improve health equity."
10849007,"CANCER CELL BIOLOGY PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cancer Cell Biology Program (CCB) is an integrative, collaborative, and clinically meaningful program that
represents a strategic evolution of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)’s prior Molecular
Oncology Program, strengthened during the current project period by 4 Members of the former Breast Cancer
Program, 5 from the former Experimental Therapeutics Program and by 12 new recruits. The overarching goal
of CCB is to identify how defects in biological pathways cause cancer and thus expose molecular vulnerabilities
that can be exploited for therapy. The CCB achieves this goal through a focus on two Specific Aims: (1)
understand therapeutic vulnerabilities within cancer-related genetic, epigenetic, and DNA damage response
mechanisms; and (2) elucidate druggable steps within cancer signal transduction networks. These Specific Aims
cut across a spectrum of intrinsic cancer biology, emphasizing the strengths of LCCC investigators. CCB
promotes intra- and inter-programmatic collaboration to address the Aims, with the ultimate goal of
transformative basic science with an eye towards clinical translation. Members have made internationally
recognized and paradigm-changing findings using small molecule and repurposed drug development, with direct
impact for patients with treatment naïve and resistant cancers. CCB Members have demonstrated considerable
entrepreneurial activity, generating and patenting intellectual property and founding their own biotechnology
companies. The strategic recruitment of 12 new investigators to CCB has stimulated an infusion of new energy,
depth, and breadth in each Aim; resulting in the formation of new initiatives and collaborations throughout LCCC,
including targeting additional cancers and research areas that have potential for disproportionate impact on
communities represented in our catchment area. Through these collaborative efforts and Aims, CCB will make
impactful contributions to our understanding of cancer biology and ultimately improvement of clinical care during
the next project period. CCB is home to 37 Members, encompassing 11 departments across the LCCC
consortium. CCB Members possess a total of $5.7M in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed funding (Annual Direct
Costs; ADC), of which $3.8M (66%) is from the NCI, $1.1M (20%) from other NIH sources, and $0.8M (14%)
from other peer-reviewed funding agencies. During the current project period, CCB Members authored a total of
319 cancer-relevant publications, of which 58 (18%) were intra-programmatic, 98 (31%) were inter-
programmatic, and 29% were in high impact journals (IF > 10). CCB Program members have been involved in
the activation of 16 new Investigator-initiated trials (IITs; 9 therapeutic, 2 interventional non-therapeutic, 5 non-
interventional) resulting in a total of 20 active IITs with 280 accruals (108 therapeutic, 131 interventional non-
therapeutic, 41 non-interventional) during the project period. Over the project period CCB members have most
used the Tissue Culture and Biobanking Shared Resource (TCBSR) and Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
Shared Resource (FCSR), with 46% of members using the TCBSR and 38% of members utilizing the FCSR."
10849008,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SRM): PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Shared Resource
Management (SRM) is to ensure LCCC Members across the Consortium have access to cutting-edge
technologies, exceptional staff, and quality services to enable high-impact cancer research and scientific
interaction and productivity. The LCCC Shared Resources (SRs) are directed by Stephen Byers, PhD, Associate
Director (AD) for SRs since 2005. In 2019, LCCC was awarded consortium status with the John Theurer Cancer
Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) in New Jersey (NJ), and the SR activities broadened to
serve investigators at both LCCC campuses. Byers is supported by two highly qualified SR Administrative
Directors: David Goerlitz, MS (DC), and Steven Park, BS (NJ) to ensure that SRs meet LCCC Member needs.
LCCC currently has nine SRs: Animal Models; Biostatistics & Bioinformatics; Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting;
Genomics & Epigenomics; Histopathology & Tissue; Mass Spectrometry & Analytical Pharmacology; Microscopy
& Imaging; Survey, Recruitment, & Biospecimen Collection; and Tissue Culture & Biobanking. SRM oversees
SR budgets and operations to ensure access, prioritization, and integration of state-of-the-art services and
technologies across the Consortium. SRM carries out annual surveys to assess SR user satisfaction and gather
suggestions regarding new services/instruments. Byers chairs the LCCC SR Oversight Committee, which meets
quarterly and is comprised of Scientific Leaders and representative LCCC Members and provides
recommendations regarding SR space, resources, policies, and procedures. Each SR has a specific SR Advisory
Committee (SRAC) consisting of representative users and SR-specific experts from both LCCC campuses that
meets at least annually to provide oversight of SR services, usage, user satisfaction, personnel, and finances.
Byers actively participates in the LCCC Senior Leadership and Executive Committees to provide strategic input
and ensure SR alignment with the Center’s programmatic research activities and priorities. During the current
project cycle, SRM accomplishments include managing the acquisition and installation of new equipment ($12.3
million) and a biorepository LIMS system (OpenSpecimen), the introduction of NJ-based pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and mass spectrometry imaging services to form the new MSAPSR, expansion of the
zebrafish facility, an S10-supported small animal MRI, and the development of multiple Spatial Biology
applications. SRs provided a broad range of services to all three LCCC Research Programs, supporting the
cancer research activities of 90 LCCC Members, including 17 based in NJ, and directly contributing to 263 peer-
reviewed publications, 50 of which appeared in high-impact journals (IF ≥ 10), and 225 peer-reviewed
extramurally funded research grants."
10849009,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Consortium is committed to reducing the
cancer burden and improving cancer equity through close collaboration with communities in its catchment area.
To achieve this goal, the LCCC Community Outreach & Engagement (COE) office supports multiple cancer-
related activities across the cancer care continuum, including needs assessment and dissemination, community
engagement, prevention and control, screening and early detection, community education, facilitation of
catchment-area research, and influence in cancer-related policy changes. The LCCC catchment area represents
a geographically and socio-demographically diverse population of approximately 6.5 million people comprising
Blacks (25%), Hispanic/Latine (23%) and a rapidly increasing Asian population (13%). This area includes DC
and surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia; and Bergen County and its surrounding counties (Passaic
and Hudson) in Northern New Jersey (NJ) with diverse cancer and cancer risk burdens. Led by Lucile Adams-
Campbell, PhD, Associate Director for Minority Health and COE, the COE office includes a diverse and bilingual
staff representative of catchment area communities. The leadership team includes Chiranjeev Dash, PhD, MBBS
MPH and Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, APRN as co-Directors of COE in DC and NJ, respectively. COE activities are
guided by the LCCC strategic plan, supported by input from external stakeholders and community members
comprising the Community Advisory Council, and are conducted in close collaboration with LCCC Research
Programs, CRTEC and DEI teams. The Specific Aims of COE are to: (1) identify and monitor the cancer burden
and risk factors within the LCCC catchment area; (2) conduct cancer-focused outreach and engagement to
disseminate and implement evidence-based research and policy in the LCCC catchment area and beyond; and
3) facilitate catchment area-relevant research with special emphasis on vulnerable and underserved populations.
COE activities across aims are focused on catchment area priorities of reducing breast, lung, gastrointestinal,
hematologic, and prostate cancer disparities, increasing cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment among
populations with social determinant barriers, facilitating community-engaged translational research on smoking
cessation and genetic counseling and testing, increasing minority accruals to therapeutic and non-therapeutic
clinical trials, and promoting healthy survivorship across the lifespan."
10849010,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: PROJECT SUMMARY
From 2018 to 2022, the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), guided by the LCCC
Strategic Plan and inspired by our catchment area priorities, distributed $1.011M of CCSG developmental funds
to support pilot research projects, aiming to support innovative research with an emphasis on strategic priorities
for multi-PI collaborations that include cross-consortium collaborations. Other sources of funds, totaling $2.1M,
included alternative grant mechanisms and philanthropy, and were used to support career development,
specialized pilot projects and shared resource development in concert with LCCC’s Strategic Plan. CCSG
support of $1.011M was provided to 24 research projects and 1 designated team science initiative from 2018-
2022, yielding an 11.8:1 Return On Investment (ROI) based on $11.93M (total direct costs) in grant funding, with
9 publications. Non-CCSG developmental funds ($865,750) have supported career development research (ACS
IRG), breast cancer, GI cancer, immunotherapy research, cross-consortium collaborative research, shared
resource vouchers, yielding an ROI of 13.9 to date, based on that category of investments. Additional funds have
supported the purchase of equipment, such as a mass spectrometer in the Mass Spectrometry and Analytical
Pharmacology Shared Resource and a slide scanner for the Histopathology and Tissue Shared Resource. In
the proposed project period we intend to prioritize CCSG funds to support pilot projects that include
transdisciplinary teams from basic, clinical, and population science, and focus on catchment area issues. We
also plan to invest developmental funds in pilots that relate to (1) radiation oncology; (2) surgical subspecialties;
and (3) transdisciplinary collaborations between investigators in the Cancer Prevention and Control Program
and either the Cancer Cell Biology Program and/or the Cancer Host Interactions Program. Additional non-CCSG
funds will help further build cross-consortium collaborations and support recruitments needed to advance our
strategic priorities."
10849011,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation is led by Louis
Weiner, MD (LCCC Director) and carried out through LCCC’s Executive and Senior Leadership, with support
from Internal and External Advisory Committees. In 2020, a rigorous process resulted in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, to be succeeded in 2026 by a 2027-2031 Strategic Plan. Through this iterative process, Weiner engaged
senior leaders, members, the Community Advisory Council (CAC), and the Executive Committee (EC) to define
a new mission and vision. LCCC’s mission is to pursue transformative research and its application in order to
more effectively prevent and treat cancer while reducing disparities at the individual, community, and global
levels, inspired by the LCCC community and a diversifying workforce. LCCC’s vision is to impact its diverse
catchment area, the nation, and beyond by advancing scientific knowledge, creativity, and application; serving
all with compassion, equity and respect; and preparing individuals who will devote themselves to reducing the
severity of cancer on the individual, family and community through improved access to care. The strong
commitment to Planning and Evaluation has resulted in strategic enhancements during the project period,
including the remodeling of leadership to reinvigorate and more fully anneal the Consortium by adding a Deputy
Director for Consortium Integration and Strategic Initiatives, a Deputy Director for Clinical Services at the NJ
Consortium partner, and appointing five new Associate Directors (ADs; 80% women); reorganization of
Research Programs with added scientific depth and six new Research Program leaders (50% women); improved
rigor of clinical research operations; and improved cohesion across the LCCC Consortium. The diverse LCCC
Senior Leadership Committee (SLC) is composed of Deputy Directors and ADs and serves as a major decision-
making body for the Center. Under Weiner’s direction, the SLC determines and confirms LCCC strategy and
aims and ensures Research Programs, Shared Resources, and Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG)
components are operational and efficient with the resources needed to meet their goals. The EC is composed
of Senior Leadership, Research Program Leaders, and others key to LCCC strategy and operations across the
Consortium. Chaired by Weiner, the EC serves as a critical forum for bidirectional communication with the SLC
on strategies and decisions for achieving overarching goals and advancing the LCCC mission and vision. In
addition, the LCCC Director relies upon multiple advisory mechanisms for input and advice: The External
Advisory Committee reviews the progress of the center and provides objective evaluation and advice; the CAC
ensures that communities are respected, informed, and engaged to collaborate on culturally relevant study
designs, data collection instruments, and dissemination methods. The Internal Advisory Committee aligns cancer
related activities, engages stakeholders, and fosters alignment of goals and initiatives across departments,
schools and across Georgetown University, Hackensack Meridian Health, and MedStar Health."
10849012,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) The CPDM Office at the Georgetown Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is comprised of 209 FTEs, providing centralized research support to
more than 95 LCCC clinical investigators across three clinical sites: MedStar Georgetown University Hospital
(MGUH) and MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) in the District of Columbia (DC), and John Theurer
Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridien Health (HMH) in New Jersey (NJ). The CPDM Office provides
central management and oversight for coordinating, facilitating, and reporting on cancer clinical trials for LCCC,
and education and training of research staff and clinical investigators. It functions as the interface with the
Protocol Review and Management System (PRMS), Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC),
Institutional Review Board (IRB), budget and contracting offices at Georgetown University Medical Center
(GUMC) and JTCC, Office of Research Quality Assurance (ORQA), disease groups (DGs), and protocol
sponsors to ensure high-quality, safe, and compliant clinical trial conduct. The CPDM Office services include
comprehensive study activation and regulatory support from protocol conception to closeout, Investigational New
Drug support, investigator-initiated trial (IIT) development and conduct, new trial registration, patient screening,
registration and trial participation support, financial management, data management, and assistance with
reporting of results through abstracts and peer-reviewed publications. The CPDM Office ensures real-time
ClinicalTrials.gov trial registration and maintenance. The CPDM Office provides comprehensive reports and
performance metrics to LCCC leadership for oversight and strategic planning including process improvement
efforts. Over the project period, the CPDM Office reported accruing 11,196 subjects to clinical research studies
conducted within LCCC (5,783 interventional and 5,413 non-interventional), including 1,073 interventional and
691 non-interventional accruals in 2022. Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) DSM efforts include a
multipronged approach of quality assurance and quality control at the protocol and institutional level. A DSM
Plan is required for all interventional studies. For LCCC IITs, an LCCC-established DSMC performs real-time
monitoring to ensure subject safety, scientific validity, and data integrity. Effective quality control functions are
also instituted to ensure the highest level of protocol compliance according to the LCCC’s NCI-approved DSMP.
Part III and IV: Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Individuals Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research
CPDM supports the LCCC and Community Outreach and Engagement priorities to proactively promote the
recruitment of women and underserved populations. In 2022, among the 1,073 individuals enrolled onto
interventional studies, 64% were women and 48% represented ethnic and racial minorities. LCCC supports NIH
policy on the inclusion in research of individuals across the lifespan. During 2022, 28 (3%) pediatric and 386
(36%) adults aged 65 years and over were enrolled onto interventional studies, respectively."
10847748,"Sialylated antibody defense against intracellular infections
Abstract. Division of labor between humoral and cellular adaptive immune components for effective host
defense is a foundational immunological tenet. Antibodies are thought to offer limited protection against
intracellular pathogens since they cannot efficiently cross the plasma membrane to enter most cells, which
may explain the prevalence of intracellular infections in fetuses and newborns given their dependence on
vertically transferred maternal IgG for early life immunity. However, we recently demonstrated that pregnancy
enables antibody-mediated protection against the prototypical intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes
(Lm). The key molecular change during pregnancy is deacetylation of sialic acid (Sia) located in the terminal
position of N-glycans on preconceptually primed Lm-specific IgG. Maternal deacetylated IgG then modulates
neonatal B cells via the Sia receptor CD22, which can only bind to deacetylated Sia. This establishes a
framework whereby differential acetylation versus deacetylation of sialylated IgG serves as a previously
unrecognized molecular “switch” that greatly impacts immunity through CD22, which in turn controls responder
B cell activation and immunomodulatory functions. While our findings reshape paradigms of antibody-mediated
host defense, they also unveil several important new gaps in knowledge, including mechanisms responsible for
addition of a six-atom, acetyl group to IgG Sia to purposefully “switch off” CD22-mediated protection. This
includes the enzymatic machinery required to add acetylated Sia to IgG N-glycans, as well as factors
controlling germinal center responses leading to production of acetylated IgG. Additionally, the subset of
neonatal CD22+ B lymphocytes that respond to “switched on” deacetylated IgG and how these B cells
modulate other immune cells are unclear. Our overall hypothesis is that overturning maternal B cell Sia
acetylation allows deacetylated IgG to bind to CD22 on neonatal Breg, suppressing their IL10 production, and
enabling protection against intracellular infection. Shared susceptibility to Lm infection between human and
rodent neonates will be exploited to further investigate how deacetylated IgG is formed and mediates
protection, through the following specific aims. Aim 1, define cell-specific control of antibody sialic acid
acetylation; Aim 2, interrogate how germinal center suppression drives antibody sialic acid acetylation; Aim 3,
investigate neonatal B cell IL10 inhibition of antibody-mediated protection. Aims 1 and 2, therefore, will
interrogate antibody secreting B cells as producers of “switched off” acetylated IgG, while Aim 3 will investigate
“switched on” deacetylated IgG modulation of IL10-poducing Breg. Completion of these aims will expand our
understanding of how to control antibody sialylation and acetylation to boost host defense against intracellular
infections, informing design of novel vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics given the ubiquity of
antibody glycosylation."
10847846,"The Interdisciplinary Program in Neurosciences (IPN) at Georgetown University (GU) is a broad-based, non-
departmental PhD program in Neuroscience. Established in 1994 and supported by the NIH from 2001 through
2023, the IPN’s primary goal is to develop “Stewards of the Discipline” by training students in the scholarly pursuit
of research in integrative neuroscience. The 33 core training faculty and 14 supporting faculty in this application
are drawn from nine clinical and basic science departments on the Medical Center and Main Campus, co-located
in Washington, DC. IPN faculty span a breadth of inquiry; core faculty are split evenly between cellular/molecular,
systems, and cognitive sciences. IPN students are very successful, those appointed to this JSPTPN published
an average of 4.8 papers with 2 as first author from their thesis training. Students average 5.6 years to conferral
of the PhD. Institutional support covers recruitment, program retreats, bridge funds for thesis students and
faculty. T32 funds are requested to support pre-thesis training for eight students (4 slots each for the 1st and 2nd
years), while GU provides matching support of eight students in those years. Participating core faculty has
increased from 25 previously to 33 due to recent recruitments of faculty into the Departments of Psychology,
Neuroscience, Pharmacology & Physiology, and Biology expanding the faculty and facilities available. A new
initiative of the Medical Center called “25 x 2025” plans to bring six new faculty this year to expand on cross-
disciplinary research with a focus on neuroscience and prioritizing recruitment of faculty from underrepresented
minority groups (URM). Five new T32s, in addition to two others, are available to support pre-thesis students to
provide more extensive training in specialized areas that fit students’ interests. The IPN consists of 40-50 thesis
and pre-thesis students. Aggressive recruitment of applicants from URM groups have been successful (29% of
students in the IPN and 66% of those appointed to the JSPTPN); this continues to be a top priority. Training
includes broad-based didactic coursework with increased emphasis on quantitative aspects and scientific rigor.
Training in quantitative critical thinking includes expansion of required coursework, additional coursework tailored
to the student’s area of research, new electives focused on Matlab and python programming for scientists, and
more broadly ongoing assessment of data analytic methods in seminars and journal clubs. Trainees participate
in intensive laboratory research, seminars, professional meetings, journal clubs, and training in essential
professional skills (writing manuscripts and grants, mentorship, teaching, oral presentations, career choices, and
ethical considerations. Students are very active in governance of the IPN. Opportunities to explore career options
are developed throughout the graduate career, particularly with the establishment of a new graduate Office of
Career Strategy and Professional Development. Upon graduation, over 70% of IPN students pursue post-
doctoral research training; 25% of those who graduated since 2006 have earned tenure track faculty positions.
About 15% go into careers related to science policy and administration in the nation’s capital area and the NIH."
10830285,"Abstract
Up to two-thirds of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will not respond to standard
pharmacological and psychological interventions and will be considered treatment resistant (TR-MDD).
Decreased reactivity to positive stimuli, indexed by low amygdala reactivity to positive autobiographical
memory recall, may be a causal mechanism interfering with recovery from TR-MDD. Previous work in our lab
suggests that individuals who do respond to antidepressant medications show increased amygdala activity that
is indistinguishable from controls relative to baseline, while TR-MDD individuals fail to show this increase in
amygdala activity. Furthermore, we have found that MDD participants (more generally, not specifically TR-
MDD) are indeed able to increase their amygdala response during positive memory recall via real-time fMRI
neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, and that this increase is associated with large and rapid reductions in
depressive symptoms. Here, we propose to evaluate whether rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdala
response to positive memories may serve as an intervention for TR-MDD. The R61 period will involve
intervention refinement and evaluation of mechanism; N=40 TR-MDD individuals will undergo five amygdala
rtfMRI-nf training sessions and we will assess changes in amygdala activity with the goal of confirming that
patients with TR-MDD are able to increase the amygdala response to positive memories, and to determine the
minimal number of training sessions required for sufficient target engagement/amygdala asymptote to be
reached. The R33 phase will involve a mechanistic comparison to a control intervention and evaluation of
clinical change (including duration of effects). N=60 TR-MDD individuals will be randomly assigned under
double-blind conditions to the amygdala rtfMRI-nf intervention or to a control rtfMRI-nf intervention where they
are trained to regulate a parietal region putatively not involved in emotional processing or MDD. Success will
suggest a new non-pharmacological, non-invasive intervention for a traditionally treatment-resistant population
of MDD individuals."
10830435,"The overall goal of my NS-supported research program is to understand the mechanisms that
stabilize the function of central nervous system (CNS) microcircuits during experience-
dependent plasticity and learning. Over the past ~20 years of NS support we discovered and
characterized several forms of homeostatic plasticity, including synaptic scaling and intrinsic
homeostatic plasticity, that are postulated to sense perturbations in mean neuronal activity,
then bidirectionally adjust synaptic and cellular properties to keep activity within a set point
range. Our recent work has focused on a) identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
these homeostatic forms of plasticity in order to bolster our mechanistic and functional
understanding, and to generate tools that allow us to selectively block homeostatic plasticity in
vivo; and b) to determine what aspect of neuronal activity is under homeostatic control in intact
CNS circuits in vivo. We recently showed that the mean firing rates of neocortical pyramidal
neurons in freely behaving animals return back to an individual baseline following prolonged
perturbations to sensory drive, strongly supporting the idea that neocortical neurons
homeostatically regulate their mean firing around an individual 'firing rate set point'. Such a
process is theoretically important for preventing circuit hypo- or hyperexcitability during
experience-dependent development, as well as to short-circuit the positive feedback nature of
Hebbian plasticity rules that can degrade memory fidelity. We now have (or are developing) the
tools to disrupt homeostatic plasticity and firing rate set points in vivo, allowing us to assess the
impact of this disruption on network function and memory storage. The major goals of my NS-
supported research program going forward are: 1) to determine how activity set points are built,
and how individual neurons can have set points that are orders of magnitude different from each
other; 2) to understand how multiple homeostatic mechanisms cooperate with each other to
stabilize network activity in the face of profound perturbations; and 3) to test the role of
synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in memory encoding and generalization.
These studies will have important implications for our understanding of neurological disorders
that arise from aberrant circuit excitability (epilepsy, autism-spectrum disorders). They may
also provide a new avenue into understanding disorders such as PTSD that are likely to arise
from excessive generalization during aversive learning."

RE: Flexible Funding Model-Infrastructure Development and Maintenance for State
Manufactured Food Regulatory Programs (U2F) Clinical Trials Not Allowed (Funding
Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number RFA-FD-23-027).
The overall goal of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Division of Food Safety (ODAFS) is to
achieve and maintain conformance with the most current version of the Manufactured Food
Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS), which are intended to enhance food safety by
establishing a uniform basis for measuring and improving the performance of manufactured
food regulatory programs in the United States and help Federal and State programs better
direct their regulatory activities at reducing foodborne illness hazards in plants that
manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods. The participation of ODAFS in the Flexible Funding
Model-Infrastructure Development and Maintenance for State Manufactured Food Regulatory
Programs (U2F) cooperative agreement will assist the program as it continues to develop and
maintain best practices for a high-quality regulatory program. In addition to maintaining

10830982,"Project Summary
Collective invasion is a major mode of metastasis observed in patients across most solid tumor types. How the
collective invasion pack operates, communicates, and navigates as a single cohesive unit remains unclear. To
address this, we published on an image-guided genomics platform to isolate any living cell(s) within a collective
invasion pack, and expand the population for genomic and molecular analysis, a technique termed
Spatiotemporal Cellular & Genomic Analysis (SaGA). We used SaGA to dissect the molecular, epigenetic, and
genomic profiles of leader and follower cells invading as a hierarchical cohesive unit. To determine how
epigenetic reprogramming drives this phenotypic heterogeneity, we deconstructed the collective invasion pack
using SaGA, then integrated genome-wide promoter methylation and transcriptome data to define differentially
methylated regions within the leader and follower phenotypes. We observe global epigenomic re-wiring in leader
cells supporting an epigenetic basis for the phenotypic heterogeneity within the collective invasion pack. We then
identified Myo10 (myosinX) as a top differentially methylated and expressed gene, where the leader cell
promoter is hypomethylated, and leaders in several lung cancer lines overexpress Myo10. Myo10 is a canonical
modulator of filopodia elongation and we show it drives filopodia elongation, collective invasion, leader cell-driven
fibronectin micropatterning (fibrillogenesis), and is transcriptionally activated by Jag1/Notch. We will use this
information to test a mechanistic model with the overarching hypothesis that Myo10 activation via promoter
hypomethylation in leader cells drives filopodia-based micropatterning of fibronectin to create a leader cell-driven
collective invasion path. We propose that this leads to an invasive advantage for lung cancer cells resulting in
metastatic disease. In Aim 1 we test the model that Myo10 hypomethylation in leaders allows for Jag1/Notch1-
driven transcriptional activation, driving filopodia elongation, and fibronectin micropatterning. In Aim 2 we test
how this collective invasion pathway impacts metastasis using in vivo metastasis models and the first patient-
derived leader cells. Throughout, we leverage unique resources developed here including SaGA-derived cell
lines, ex vivo imaging, and patient-derived lung cancer leader cells. We speculate that these data will provide
mechanistic insight into collective invasion and translational value towards understanding lung cancer patient
leader cell biology."
10831062,"Targeting RNA Splicing in Glioma
 RNA alternative splicing (AS) is an evolutionally conserved co-transcriptional process, regulates
transcriptome and proteome landscapes in eukaryotes, and in human diseases such as cancer. Unlike the
numerous studies that have been conducted for characterizing glioma genomes, transcriptomes,
methylomes, and proteomes, little has been done to associate glioma driver mutations with AS programs
and evaluate the impact of dysregulated AS on cancer malignancy. Our analyses of AS in three glioma
patient RNA-seq datasets indicate two AS glioma subtypes that show associations with WHO tumor grade,
glioma driver mutations, and patient prognosis. Utilizing a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-
derived glioma “avatar” model and clinical glioma models, we show that IDH1R132H/WT or PTEN-/-
/CDKN2A/2B-/-/TertpC228T/WT/EGFRvIII genotypes influence subtype-associated AS programs. Two subsets
of RBPs that affect RNA splicing are differentially associated with these two AS glioma subtypes.
Expression of subtype-associated RBPs or AS isoforms also affected AS events and growth of glioma
stem-like cells (GSCs). In this research project, we plan to leverage our previous contributions, existing
research program, recent findings, newly established glioma avatar models, cutting-edge CRISPR editing
technology, and outstanding scientific premise to study whether glioma mutations influence AS programs
and how RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and AS gene isoforms contribute to glioma tumor biology. AS
programs will also be exploited for therapeutic intervention in treating gliomas. This project will address
key gaps in our understanding of the relationships between glioma driver mutations and tumor-associated
AS programs, and test whether targeting RNA splicing constitutes a therapeutic vulnerability to treat
gliomas. In addressing these knowledge gaps this research will influence our understanding and treatment
of glioma, and in so doing will likely influence the study of other cancers."
10831068,"Abstract
Cognitive deficits are major disabling impairments associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently
available drugs have poor efficacy due to a limited understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms
underlying these deficits. Our project addresses this unmet need by exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of
cognitive deficits. Copy number variants (CNVs), such as a 1.5 Mb hemizygous deletion of 22q11.2, and variants
of single genes, such as heterozygous variants of Tbx1, a 22q11.2 gene, have been associated with a high risk
of cognitive deficits in humans and serve as promising mechanistic entry points. As many social, memory, and
cognitive deficits in individuals with these genetic variants manifest during childhood (i.e., a postnatal period after
birth and before full adulthood), our previous work focused on post-embryonic cellular events. We showed that
the heterozygosity of Tbx1 in early postnatal neural stem cells contribute to deficits in social interactions and that
altered postnatal myelination in the fimbria may represent a potential cellular substrate for impaired cognitive
speed. This proposed project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in postnatal myelination due to
dose alterations of genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders negatively impact cognitive speed. To
allow for the disambiguation of the relative roles of postnatal oligodendrogenesis and postnatal neurogenesis in
cognitive speed, we developed two conditional Tbx1 heterozygous mouse models: Ng2CreER;Tbx1flox/+ and
nesCreERT2;Tbx1flox/+ mice. To evaluate the relative roles played by Tbx1 and 22q11.2 CNV in cognitive speed,
we will include a mouse model of 22q11.2 hemizygous deletion. Aim 1 will evaluate the impacts on cognitive
speed of conditional heterozygous Tbx1 deletion from postnatal stem/progenitor cells of oligodendrocyte or
neuronal lineage in mice and determine the relative contributions to cognitive speed of Tbx1 deficiency
compared with global 22q11.2 hemizygosity. We will use rodent tasks for spatial memory, cognitive flexibility,
and working memory, as the speed of these cognitive dimensions are negatively impacted from childhood
among carriers of 22q11.2 hemizygosity. Aim 2 will identify regions with altered white matter integrity, assess
axonal myelination in affected brain regions, and evaluate the conductance speed of myelin-deficient pathways
using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-MRI, electron microscopy, and electrophysiological recordings, respectively,
in the three mouse models. Aim 3 will evaluate the in vivo functional roles of TBX1’s target genes in the
cognitive functions in mutant mice and establish the precise cellular processes associated with postnatal
oligodendrogenesis and myelin production in vivo and in vitro. The current proposal will reveal novel postnatal
cellular mechanisms associated with a distinct dimension of cognitive function, improving our understanding of
the cellular mechanisms contributing to altered cognitive dimensions that are severely impacted by 22q11.2
hemizygosity, Tbx1 and TBX1’s non-22q11.2 target genes, which will provide a mechanistic basis for the
development of therapeutic options."
10831071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the most prevalent and impactful complications of diabetes mellitus
(DM). The combination of diabetes and sexual dysfunction affects family planning and overall quality of life, and
ED is now considered an early marker for cardiovascular diseases and consequently could predate the
development of a life-threatening condition. Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and inflammation are all associated
with DM and induce the generation of vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) is the main source of ROS in the vasculature and ROS activate
intracellular signaling pathways that induce constriction of the penile vasculature. In vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs), this signaling cascade begins with extracellular superoxide (O2-•) production by Nox1 at the
plasma membrane. Extracellular O2-• from Nox1 can alter vascular tone by inactivating endothelium-derived
nitric oxide (NO). But O2-• also triggers activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling to cause constriction of the
penile vasculature. In diabetes, activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling is exaggerated leading to ED.
 We have demonstrated functional and structural inter-dependence between Nox1 and volume-regulated
anion channels (VRACs) composed of leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 (LRRC8) family proteins. LRRC8A is
required for all VRACs and combines with one of four closely related LRRC8 isoforms (LRRC8B through E) to
produce channels with unique biophysical properties. We speculate and provide preliminary data that VRACs
provide O2-• access to the cytoplasm. Our preliminary data demonstrate that LRRC8 knockout (KO) or channel
inhibition enhances dilator function (or reduces constriction) in control blood vessels and null mice are protected
against impairment of vasodilation by TNFα in vitro and angiotensin II (AngII) in vivo.
 This proposal will provide a structural framework to understand how extracellular O2-• produces
intracellular signals that lead to contraction of the penile vasculature. We hypothesize that in diabetes, erectile
dysfunction is partly due to the entry of extracellular O2-• from Nox1 via LRRC8 anion channels to activate
RhoA/Rho-kinase resulting in vascular contraction. Three aims address this central hypothesis: 1) to test
the hypothesis that in diabetes, ED is caused by excess Nox1 and LRRC8A-dependent production of
extracellular O2-• which then enters VSMCs via LRRC8A anion channels, activates RhoA/Rho kinase and
increases vascular tone; 2) to test the hypothesis that diabetic mice that lack the LRRC8 channel in the
vasculature will not develop ED; and 3) to test the hypothesis that drugs that selectively inhibit LRRC8 channels
will be novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of ED in diabetes. This work will provide a comprehensive
approach to understanding the role of LRRC8/VRACs, O2-• and RhoA in the etiology and development of ED in
diabetic males and provide a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of the disorder."

Repeated and excessive alcohol consumption is known to lead to brain damage, and may increase the risk
of developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). A recent study demonstrated that light-to-moderate alcohol
consumption, as low as eight drinks a week, may be associated with cognitive decline and AD. Not
surprisingly, alcohol consumption appears to be more harmful to the elderly. Since alcohol metabolism
rates decline with age, it could have a greater effect and may exacerbate underlying cognitive problems.
However, the limitation of these epidemiological studies includes their observational nature without a
mechanistic investigation of the “cause and effect” on how alcohol may impact the AD development.
Importantly, it is widely known that women are approximately twice as likely to develop AD. However,
genetic and biological basis of the sex specific differences in AD is understudied. Therefore, it is essential
to understand to what extent alcohol could exacerbate the development of AD depending on the starting
age of alcohol consumption, sex, and genetic risk factors. Based on the in-depth expertise in alcohol use
disorder (AUD) (Dr. Choi) and AD (Dr. Trushina), two PIs propose to conduct a collaborative research
applying comprehensive approach to address these fundamental questions. Using two mouse models
representing familial AD (APP/PS1) and late-onset sporadic AD (ApoE4KI), we will examine whether
alcohol exposure has sex and/or age-dependent effect exacerbating the onset and development of AD in
at-risk individuals. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In the first aim, we will
determine whether chronic alcohol exposure exacerbates AD-like behavioral and metabolic phenotype in
APP/PS1 and ApoE4KI mouse models. In the second aim, we will determine the impact of chronic alcohol
exposure on the pathophysiology and biomarkers of AD. The outcomes will be significant providing
comprehensive data and critical biological evidence to establish the preclinical criteria and provide
translatable information regarding the impact of alcohol on AD."
10839982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic burn injuries generate excruciating pain resulting from tissue and nerve damage and the
accompanying exaggeration of inflammation. Necessary wound care procedures such as debridement, burn
excision, grafting, and mobilization only add to this pain. For these reasons, pain from traumatic burn injury is
notoriously difficult to manage; hence current reports suggest that burn-related pain is currently undertreated.
Traumatic injuries have a dramatic increase in pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) and accelerated development of
tolerance to opioid analgesics compared with non-traumatic injuries. Unfortunately, the mechanisms driving
increased sensitivity and tolerance following trauma are unclear. Furthermore, over half of all burn survivors
develop chronic pain, making the transition from acute to chronic pain a significant concern following burn injury.
Research has primarily focused on the innate immune response to injury as a leading candidate; however, the
recent inclusion of female subjects has uncovered sex-specific differences in immune-modulated pain sensitivity.
These findings have led to reconsideration of the influence of sex on pain processing and whether the body of
male-only research is truly applicable. It is well known that females are more likely to report more severe pain
and to experience chronic pain following such injuries; however, the mechanisms behind these sex-specific
differences are currently unknown. Additionally, stress-induced adaptations in the neuroendocrine system are
believed to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pain outcomes. Dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathoadrenal axes following traumatic injury has been shown to reduce
the activity of descending pathways that modulate endogenous pain inhibition and opioid analgesia. We
hypothesize that the immune response involved in the pathogenesis of pain following traumatic burn injury is
regulated in a sex-specific manner through involvement of the neuroendocrine system. Exploiting these sex-
specific differences may be key to understanding how to treat pain generated from traumatic burn injuries. Sex-
specific genes, hormones, and signaling mechanisms may shed light on novel targets that have been previously
overlooked, giving great hope for future sex-specific interventions. Accordingly, the proposed research program
will address this critical gap in our understanding by systematically investigating the role of sex-specific immune
reactivity and neuroendocrine responses in an animal model of full-thickness thermal burn injury. This program
of research will lead us closer to understanding mechanisms that make pain from traumatic burn injuries so
challenging to treat and identify sex-related drivers behind them. Our goal over the duration of this award is to
identify sex-specific mechanisms underlying the accelerated development of tolerance and hyperalgesia and to
provide insight to potential targets for sex-specific interventions to treat acute pain and prevent the transition to
chronic pain. Conduct of these studies will build a robust program of research positioned to investigate any
promising targets we may uncover."

Prenatal exposure to the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a threat to the fetus, putting the neonate at risk for significant
birth defects (termed congenital Zika syndrome) and neurodevelopmental deficits developing during early child-
hood. There are currently no predictors to indicate which children will develop deficits and the neuropathologies
underlying these deficits is not defined. It is critical to predict which infants will later develop deficits to max-
imize long-term sensorimotor development and functional outcomes. Furthermore, understanding underlying
neuropathogenesis is necessary to develop targeted interventions. The purpose of this grant is to define the
long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of ZIKV by rapidly obtaining data from highly controlled studies of
rhesus macaques.
Specifically, we will:
Aim 1: Characterize sensorimotor neurodevelopmental outcomes in macaques with prenatal ZIKV expo-
sure. Behavioral assessments focused on sensorimotor development may highlight the distinct developmental
trajectories and increased deficits with age in ZIKV-exposed rhesus macaques. Because macaques develop
more quickly than humans, sensorimotor neurodevelopmental differences that occur by year 3 may predict
future impacts in children born with prenatal ZIKV exposure.
Aim 2: Identify early neural predictors of sensorimotor neurodevelopmental deficits in ZIKV-exposed
infant macaques with quantitative MRI, hearing and visual studies. We will describe differences between
ZIKV-exposed and mock-infection control infants and identify individual differences within ZIKV-exposed in-
fants to determine the full spectrum of brain abnormalities.
Aim 3: Define neuropathology underlying sensorimotor neurodevelopmental deficits with quantitative
brain histopathology. Using cellular quantification and organization of brain nuclei, we aim to identify the neu-
ropathogenesis of congenital Zika syndrome to better create appropriate, targeted interventions for children.
This study utilizes a large cohort of ZIKV-exposed infant macaques that have been born in other NIH-funded
studies and capitalizes on our collaborative team of experts in neuropathology, neurodevelopment and neu-
roradiology."
10839990,"The objective of this application is to examine how augmented muscle mass, a by-product of the exercise
intervention commonly prescribed for treatment of obesity and sarcopenia, can prevent and rescue metabolic
and vascular dysfunction in sarcopenic obesity. The core hypothesis of this application is that targeting skeletal
muscle function in aging can ameliorate metabolic dysfunction and oxidant-induced hypertension in obesity
and lay the groundwork for establishment of an independent research program directed toward determining if
obesity-derived cardiometabolic dysfunction can be rescued through augmented mass with aging and specific
fiber types.
The goals of this application will be accomplished by examining the effect of augmented muscle mass, through
myostatin deletion, on cardiometabolic function in a mouse model of obesity (the db/db mouse). Experimental
methods include in vivo blood pressure using telemetry in conscious mice, vascular function assessments
using pressure myography of isolated vessels, and metabolic function using metabolic chambers, glucose
tolerance tests, whole body quantification of lean mass and adiposity via DXA Piximus, and blood lipid profiles.
Our data indicate that increasing muscle mass in obese mice protects against the loss of muscle mass and
strength, glycemic control and vascular dysfunction, which accompany obesity in the db/db mouse.
Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that these improvements to metabolic and cardiovascular function
prevent hypertension in the db/db mouse. Further, this application will determine the relative contribution to
organ specific oxidant stress, namely vascular NOX1 and renal NOX4 in a model of sarcopenic obesity.
The model currently used (constitutive myostatin deletion) involves lifelong augmented muscle. A key question
remains unanswered; can augmented muscle rescue/reverse obesity-derived cardiovascular dysfunction or is
lifelong fitness essential? The applicant intends to focus his transition to independence on answering these key
questions. I will use a novel inducible knockout of myostatin in a db/db mouse to determine if augmented
muscle mass can rescue metabolic and vascular dysfunction after development of a fully obese phenotype.
This will serve to mimic the patient population and allow for results to translate to the clinic. Additionally,
literature suggests that skeletal muscle fiber type plays a crucial role in outcomes. The myostatin model used
results in predominantly glycolytic skeletal muscle expansion and it would be advantageous to determine if a
mouse model of obesity with predominantly oxidative skeletal muscle expansion (PGC1) would have similar
cardiometabolic improvements."

Chromosome abnormalities due to meiotic errors are a leading cause of birth defects and spontaneous
abortions in humans. Our overarching goal is to understand how the organization of chromosomes in the
nucleus contributes to the correct pairing, synapsis, and recombination of homologous chromosomes during
meiosis I prophase– and how infidelity in these processes lead to chromosomal abnormalities. The basic
mechanisms leading to homolog pairing, synapsis and recombination are well conserved. The study of a wide
range of organisms has ultimately led to insights into human gamete aneuploidy and infertility. We use two
model organisms, budding yeast and zebrafish, each providing a unique lens to address how the 3D
configuration of chromosomes is governed to accommodate the changes in the nuclear landscape throughout
meiotic prophase. Our work addresses three key questions in the field of chromosome biology: 1) How do
chromosomes balance the contributions of diffusive versus active motion, 2) How does movement promote
molecular transactions between chromosomes? And 3) how do cells sense and respond to unpaired meiotic
chromosomes to ensure reproductive fidelity? 1) To understand how chromosomes move, we will examine the
contributions of diffusion, constrained diffusion, and active motor-driven movement on chromosomal loci in
yeast by comparing data sets of XYZ coordinates of tagged loci over time using our newly developed imaging
pipeline. We will compare these outcomes with newly developed models of chromosome behavior based on
simple biophysical properties of polymers. We will test if the nuclear pore complex also contributes to
chromosome motion, building on our discovery of a role of the NPC in meiotic chromosome dynamics. 2) To
understand how the organization of chromosomes in the much larger vertebrate nucleus contributes to
effective homolog pairing we will build on our recent work in zebrafish showing the initial events of pairing and
synapsis all take place at the telomere bouquet, suggesting that pairing in the larger nucleus is accommodated
by temporally and spatially sequestering pairing factors in time and space. We will test if telomere attachment
or positioning at the nuclear membrane is important for pairing, and we will identify the epigenetic markers that
define pairing-competent features of chromosomes. 3) To understand how cells respond to unpaired
chromosomes and how does this response differ between species, and even between sexes of the same
species, we will take advantage of our recent findings that synaptic errors cause arrest in spermatogenesis in
zebrafish males. Furthermore, synaptic errors in females are tolerated, thus raising the tantalizing possibility
that the surveillance and silencing of asynapsed chromosomes checkpoints does not operate in zebrafish."

 I (John N. Mafi, MD, MPH) am an Assistant Professor at UCLA, with a secondary Natural Scientist
appointment at RAND. I practice general internal medicine and pursue health services research focused on
identifying and reducing low-value care—patient care that provides no net benefit in specific clinical scenarios,
and can also cause harm. After receiving outstanding training in health services research at Harvard University
and publishing a series of papers on low-value care, I have turned the focus of my research on studying older
adults because they disproportionately suffer from low-value care and its consequences. A major barrier to
reducing low-value care in older adults is a lack of valid measures: current measurement relies on claims data
(e.g., billing claims physicians submit to Medicare) that lack enough clinical detail to correctly classify care as
“low value.” In contrast, electronic health records (EHRs) contain richer clinical data and are also a potential
tool for reducing low-value care. To advance my career goals and improve care for older adults, I propose to
develop an EHR-based low-value care measure (“eMeasure”), and then design and test an intervention
consisting of a behavioral economic EHR clinical decision support tool (EHR CDS) to reduce low-value care in
older adults. My prototype focus will address low-value proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs, which are associated
with some harm. My overarching goal is to improve the health and healthcare of older Americans by becoming
a leading principal investigator utilizing the EHR to measure and reduce low-value care in older adults.
 To achieve this goal, I seek support from the NIA Beeson Career Development Award. I have the support
of an outstanding group including primary mentor Dr. Catherine Sarkisian (Professor, PI of NIA-R01 pragmatic
trial), co-primary mentor Dr. Cheryl Damberg (PI of RAND/AHRQ U19 Center), mentors Dr. Ron Hays (Quality
Measure Expert), Dr. Eric Cheng (Chief Medical Informatics Officer), Dr. Noah Goldstein (Economist), and
collaborators Dr. Folasade May (Gastroenterologist), Dr. Sam Skootsky (Chief Medical Officer), and Dr. Chi-
Hong Tseng (Statistician). I will acquire skills in EHR-based quality measure development and utilization
(Damberg/Hays/Cheng), geriatrics (Sarkisian), behavioral economics and behavior change (Goldstein),
pragmatic trials testing user-centered EHR decision support (Sarkisian/Damberg/Cheng), and leadership.
 I propose 3 specific aims for my career development: (1) Develop and test an eMeasure of low-value PPI
prescriptions among older adults, (2) Design and pilot test an intervention (behavioral economic EHR CDS) to
reduce low-value PPI prescriptions in older adults to determine feasibility and (3) Implement and evaluate a
delayed-onset pragmatic trial of the intervention at UCLA Health—informing an NIA R01 proposal for a
multisite pragmatic trial. I will apply knowledge learned from my training to Aims #1-3. The Beeson Award
would provide me with the training and skills needed to become a national leader and independent clinician
scientist utilizing the EHR to rigorously measure and reduce harmful, low-value care among older Americans."
10862551,"This research builds on prior funded research that helped to define a novel approach to improve
exercise for those with high level spinal cord injuries (SCI). SCI is associated with greater risk
for cardiovascular disease compared to the general population, but those with high level SCI
have the greatest cardiometabolic risk factors and highest risk of mortality due to heart disease.
This is likely due to the fact that those with injuries above T3 have the most loss of skeletal and
pulmonary muscle function. As a result, those with high level SCI cannot exercise at intensities
resulting in the unique cardioprotective effects of regular aerobic exercise. We have refined a
unique form of exercise for those with SCI that mirrors exercise in the able-bodied. Functional
Electrical Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled
leg exercise, resulting in the benefits of large muscle mass exercise. However, despite potential
for enhancing aerobic capacity by training the denervated leg skeletal muscle via hybrid FES
exercise, the inability to increase ventilation beyond limits set by high level SCI restricts
exercise capacity. The increase in ventilatory requirements with FESRT results in an imbalance
between ventilatory capacity and greater whole body skeletal muscle demand after FESRT.
This observation led to the exploration of external ventilatory support (NIV) to improve exercise
capacity in high level SCI. This work strongly suggests that NIV acutely increases aerobic
capacity, but only in those with high level SCI and shorter injury duration. In addition,
pharmacologic treatments may augment respiratory control and improve exercise ventilatory
responses. Buspirone can reverse respiratory abnormalities consequent to SCI in rats, and
humans case reports suggest successful Buspirone treatment of respiratory dysfunction.
Therefore, we propose a double-blind 2x2 trial of 6mo of FESRT with NIV or Sham and
Buspirone or Placebo in individuals with acute(<3 years), high-level (>T3) SCI. We hypothesize
that both NIV and Buspirone will improve ventilatory exercise responses and that combined
treatment will have the greatest effect. This will result in greater improvements in aerobic
capacity and concomitant increases in pulmonary function and reductions in cardiometabolic
risk. This work proposes two approaches to overcome ventilatory limitations to exercise in high
level SCI and allow for greater improvements in cardiopulmonary capacity - one that overcomes
mechanical limitations of paralyzed pulmonary musculature and one that treats loss of
serotonergic respiratory control, both of which may contribute to blunted ventilatory responses.
The ultimate purpose of this research is to optimize exercise for a population that both needs
and seeks the broad range of benefits that exercise can confer."

Alphaviruses are mosquito-transmitted viruses that cause severe disease in humans. The genus is divided into
two groups: Arthritogenic viruses cause arthralgia and musculoskeletal disease that can persist for years after
infection, and encephalitic viruses infect the brain and can cause long-term neurological injury or lethality. The
goal of FLARE Center Project 3 is a structure-based and epitope-focused design of next-generation vaccine
candidates for two prototype alphaviruses, one arthritogenic (chikungunya virus, CHIKV) and one encephalitic
(Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, VEEV). CHIKV is globally distributed and has emerged in part due to
sequence adaptations that enabled an expanded range of mosquito vectors. VEEV is endemic to the Americas
and has caused large epidemics in South and Central America. We hypothesize that structural conservation
among alphaviruses, coupled with recent advancements in elucidating details of molecular interactions
between the alphavirus E1/E2 glycoprotein and protective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or host receptors, will
enable immunogen design strategies that yield safe and effective vaccines that can be rapidly adapted to other
alphaviruses. Our objective is to build a ‘plug-and-play’ workflow of immunogen and vaccine platform pairs that
can be deployed for emerging or new alphaviruses. Aim 1 focuses on optimization of the E2 B-domain (E2-B),
which is engaged by broadly protective mAbs. Aim 2 explores the E1 fusion loop (E1-FL) as a vaccine target,
based on the recent discovery that human E1-FL-specific mAbs have pan-alphavirus protective potential via
non-neutralizing, Fc-mediated mechanisms. In Aim 3, structures of the hexameric E1/E2 spike bound to host
receptors MXRA8 (CHIKV) or LDLRAD3 (VEEV) will be used as a template to engineer immunogens that
capture the prefusion complex (preE12), enabling exposure of key quaternary epitopes. Immunogens will be
integrated into protein nanoparticles or, in collaboration with our industry partner Moderna, encoded as lipid-
encapsulated mRNA vaccines. Successful designs will be compared head-to-head with virus-like particle
(VLPs)-based vaccines in murine models of arthritis (CHIKV) and lethal disease (CHIKV and VEEV) in Aim 4.
After down-selection and rigorous Go/No-Go decisions, the top vaccine candidates will be transitioned to
Animal Core D for further evaluation in mice and non-human primates. Project 3 will work closely with the
Scientific and Administrative Cores to accomplish these objectives and is conceptually and technically linked
to other FLARE Center Projects focused on flaviviruses and alphaviruses."

Central visual field loss due to diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a large and growing
problem, particularly in the elderly. Although much has been done to understand visual limitations associated
with this problem in a static context, studies of binocular oculomotor behaviors in a naturalistic context are
lacking. As a result, little is known about how those with central field loss (CFL) meet daily demands, such as
shifting their gaze between targets in depth, stabilizing images on the retina during linear motion, or coordinating
eye and head movements in situations where vestibularly-driven compensatory reflexes are in conflict with visual
gaze shifting demands. These essential behaviors, developed to place and maintain the fovea on target, and
thus use it as the reference in healthy vision. Deficits in these behaviors become particularly dangerous in the
context of mobility and navigation of busy environments, where gaze shifting and retinal stabilization play a key
role in preventing stumbling, collisions, and falls – which can lead to injury or be fatal in older adults most affected
by AMD. These individuals often do not have a functional fovea, commonly using an eccentric fixational locus
that may not be symmetric in the two eyes.
This proposal seeks to address the gap in our understanding of how loss of foveal fixation and acuity, as well as
loss of binocular information affects these essential behaviors. The first Aim examines binocular eye movements
to targets in depth, looking at not only the capacity for vergence, but also accuracy of the eye movement and
depth cues needed to improve gaze placement in individuals with CFL. The world is inherently three-dimensional
and understanding how those with central field deficits are able to acquire information can help better understand
how challenges posed by known visual deficits are further exacerbated in daily living. The second Aim
investigates the interaction of linear motion and retinal stabilization of targets at different depths. We will use
fore-aft motion that emulates translations during forward walking to test individuals’ ability to stabilize objects at
different viewing eccentricities and depths. The experiments in this Aim are the first of their kind and will explicitly
address the capacity for retinal stabilization during linear motion in CFL. The findings can inform specific training
and rehabilitation strategies to reduce instability and falls. The final Aim examines the capacity for cancellation
of the vestibuloocular response (VOR) when it is in conflict with visually-driven oculomotor demands. When the
head moves, the VOR counterrotates the eyes to maintain retinal stability. However, when an individual uses
the head and eyes to track or visually acquire a target, the VOR can pull the eyes away from the object of interest.
If deficient, head movements become disadvantageous, suggesting a different set of strategies for gaze shifting
in CFL. Combined, these experiments could have significant implications on how individuals with CFL are
advised and trained to interact with their environment while maintaining an active and productive lifestyle."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects more than 3 million adults of the United States

However, the molecular mechanism of EC dysfunction and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of HFpEF
are still poorly understood. A recent patient study identified serum neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a prognostic marker
in HFpEF patients. Our preliminary data indicate that endothelial NRP1 is increased in the cardiac tissues of
murine HFpEF models and mice deficient of endothelial NRP1 show improved EC and cardiac diastolic
functions in these models. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a major inducer of EC dysfunction and
associates with the disease progression of HFpEF. Our preliminary data suggest that knockdown of NRP1
reduces TNFα-induced expression of adhesion molecules but enhances the levels of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) in ECs. Computational docking model and protein binding assay collectively indicate the
direct interaction between NRP1 and TNFα. Based on these results, this project will test the central hypothesis
that endothelial NRP1, acting as a novel co-receptor with TNFR, leads to the pathogenesis of HFpEF by
increasing cardiac inflammation and impairing myocardial nitric oxide bioavailability.
Two Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Delineate the crosstalk between NRP1 and TNFα/TNFR in EC
dysfunction. We will characterize the interaction between NRP1 and TNFα/TNFR using microplate-based
binding assay and cultured ECs. The role of NRP1 in TNFα-induced EC dysfunction will be examined in both
mouse and zebrafish endothelial cell specific NRP1 knockout models. Aim 2: Reveal the role of endothelial
NRP1 in the pathogenesis of HFpEF. We will use mouse HFpEF models to investigate how endothelial NRP1
cooperates with TNFR1 to control the disease initiation and progression of HFpEF."

Purinergic signaling plays fundamental roles in activities of the nervous system as diverse as neuroprotection,
synaptic transmission, nociception, inflammation, and taste. This process is initiated by releasing adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) across the membrane through the classic exocytosis or ATP-permeable channels into the
synaptic cleft; the ATP then binds downstream receptors on an adjacent cell. The pannexin family is one of the
key ATP-permeable channels and consists of three family members, PANX1-3. PANX1 is the best characterized
functionally, and it plays crucial roles in a variety of contexts, including blood pressure regulation, glucose uptake,
apoptotic cell clearance, and human oocyte development. Although PANX2 and PANX3 have been less studied
than PANX1, they are important in neuronal development, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and skin/skeleton
development. Thus, the PANX channels have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for a diverse range of
diseases.
The PANX1-3 are nonselective, large-pore ion channels, and they are predicted to share a four-transmembrane-
helix (4-TM) topology with connexins, innexins, and volume-regulated anion channels. Biochemical and
physiological studies provide a consensus view that PANX family members form hexameric channels but do not
form gap junctions. PANX can be modulated by various factors, including mechanical scratch, extracellular
potassium, intracellular calcium, phosphorylation, and caspase-dependent cleavage, but the molecular
mechanisms aren’t known. PANX1 activity is modulated by a wide range of small-molecule compounds, but most
of them are not specifically targeting PANX1. There is currently no well-characterized agent that modulates the
activity of PANX2 and PANX3. Although PANXs are central to human physiology and are potential targets of
therapeutic agents, we do not know their structures. We do not understand, in molecular detail, how the channel
is activated or inhibited, or how it is modulated by small molecules binding at specific sites.
In this proposed work, we will carry out in-depth structural and functional studies of the three pannexin channels
to understand how these molecules work. We have determined the first cryo-EM structure of human PANX1 in
the apo state at 3.7 Å and found a heptameric assembly. We have also shown that human PANX1 can be purified
in a native-like lipid environment. Building on this preliminary data, we propose to continue the structural studies
of these family members, combined with complementary electrophysiology experiments, proteolipsome-based
dye transfer assays, binding assays, and other functional approaches, to define the molecular basis for a
comprehensive gating mechanism. We will also locate the binding sites of various drugs and the molecular basis
underlying their actions on PANX channels, using a combination of structural and functional approaches. These
advances will provide a solid foundation for developing new drugs against PANX-linked diseases and for a
deeper understanding of the function of the ATP release channel family."

 Homeostasis requires most, if not all, pathways to function rapidly and precisely. While
cooperative interactions between proteins and cofactors helps ensure selectivity, the events
mediating dynamic action are less well understood. Further complicating pathway performance is the
nature of the cell interior, as it is densely packed and often contains multiple binding partners for each
protein—both features increase non-productive or off-pathway interactions. These variables present
great challenges for achieving homeostasis especially in the midst of fluctuating internal and external
stimuli that must be monitored constantly to appropriately initiate, continue, or halt cellular processes.
Hence, biological complexes must be actively and persistently disassembled in order to work on a
useful time scale. We suggest that the broad binding specificity and energy-independent molecular
chaperone activities of the Hsp90 chaperone system govern the kinetic behaviors of the diverse
proteins within cells. Basically, Hsp90 and its cochaperones resolve inherently stable cooperative
complexes into a dynamic machinery capable of rapid action that enables efficient and timely
biological pathways."

Women living in historically redlined neighborhoods impacted by structural racism and discrimination (SRD) have
shorter breast cancer (BCa) recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to women living in non-historically redlined
neighborhoods. This disparity persists after controlling for individual, behavior, lifestyle, environmental, tumor, and
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant treatment characteristics, suggesting unaccounted
mechanisms by which SRD impact BCa RFS. Our preliminary data indicate that SRD, through neural influences
on BCa biology, may shorten BCa RFS. Specifically, we leveraged the novel genomic-epidemiologic infrastructure
of our Miami Breast Cancer Disparities study, a prospective cohort study with clinically and survey-annotated blood
and tissue samples, to discover that both objective SRD [defined using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes
(ICE)] and subjective perceived discrimination [PD, defined using the using the Expanded Everyday Discrimination
Scale Survey (EEDS)] are independent predictors of 1) higher levels of myeloid lineage immune cell activation in
blood (a pattern known as the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity; CTRA) and 2) a more aggressive
BCa molecular biology profile (up-regulation of proinflammatory transcription factors (TF) NF-kB and AP-1), after
controlling for individual (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, behavior, lifestyle, comorbidities), environmental (e.g., air
pollution), tumor (e.g., stage, subtype), and treatment (e.g., neoadjuvant chemotherapy) factors. In addition, this
aggressive BCa molecular biology profile correlated with shorter RFS. We also discovered that both SRD and PD
are associated with up-regulation of TF CREB (a marker of SNS activity), implicating the SNS as a potential
mediator of SRD and shorter RFS through pro-inflammatory NF-kB and AP-1 regulation. Combined, our preliminary
data provide strong evidence for our central hypothesis that SRD and PD are associated with shorter RFS, in part,
through biologic mechanisms mediated by SNS regulation (CREB) of circulating myeloid lineage immune cells
(CTRA) resulting in an aggressive tumor biology molecular profile. To test our central hypothesis, we propose the
following aims in the largest social genomics BCa study to date, consisting of 750 diverse (∼18% non-Hispanic
White, 24% non-Hispanic Black, and 58% Hispanic) BCa patients enrolled in our MBCD study: Aim 1) Define the
contributions of objective SRD and subjective PD on BCa RFS. Aim 2) Validate the biologic mechanisms mediating
the effects of SRD on RFS. Aim 3) Evaluate the spatial effects of clinical and biologic correlates of shorter RFS.
Combined, these findings, to our knowledge, will represent the single largest social genomics and geospatial BCa
research effort to study BCa RFS disparities with an innovative focus on 1) isolating the distinct biologic
mechanisms associated with SRD (ICE) and PD (EEDS) and RFS, and 2) geospatial identification of at-risk
neighborhoods defined as having more SRD, aggressive biology, and shorter RFS to inform future policy and
targeted behavioral or therapeutic to deduce SNS activity to adversity and thus based on prior randomized control
trials, reverse aggressive tumor biology, ultimately improving BCa RFS for high-risk marginalized populations."
10860375,"Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a well-developed indispensable tool for
solving complex problems in biochemistry and structural biology. Pulse EPR encompasses several established
methods such as double electron-electron resonance (DEER), relaxation-induced dipolar modulation
enhancement (RIDME), and double quantum coherence (DQC) spectroscopy that are uniquely suited for
obtaining long-range (up to 10 nm or longer) distances and distance distributions between spin labeled sites in
biomacromolecules. The distances between endogenous paramagnetic metal centers can also be determined.
Another particularly impactful application of pulse EPR is in studies of metalloenzymes, where such methods as
3-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy, electron nuclear double resonance
(ENDOR), hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy (HYSCORE), and electron double resonance detected
NMR (EDNMR) spectroscopy have evolved into highly informative techniques for providing mechanistic details
on the function of many important metalloenzymes without the need of preparing protein crystals. However, for
all these pulse methods insufficient concentration sensitivity remains the main roadblock towards their broader
applicability in biochemical and biophysical research. The goal of this technology development project is to
dramatically - by at least one to two orders of magnitude - increase concentration sensitivity of pulse W-band
(94 GHz) EPR spectroscopy by developing large-volume, high-quality factor (high-Q), and high finesse
microwave resonators based on low-loss dielectric materials. So far this new pulse EPR technology has been
only demonstrated as a proof-of-principle and will require further substantial efforts including: (Aim 1) Design
and optimization of high volume / high quality factor resonators for pulse EPR for the best concentration
sensitivity and construction of the resonator prototypes; (Aim 2) Development of critical mm-wave
instrumentation to implement high volume / high sensitivity resonators for routine and advanced W-band pulse
EPR experiments; and (Aim 3) Validating the new technology using well studied and well characterized systems.
The latter will be done by carrying out 14N ESEEM/HYSCORE experiments with Fe center in myoglobin and di-
Mn complexes, evaluating 55Mn EDNMR sensitivity gains for a series of Mn ion complexes, including di-Mn
clusters as well as S3 state of the oxygen evolving complex of PSI, and applying the DEER method to resolve
distance and angular information for a series of rigid biradicals, transmembrane peptides and rhodopsin
oligomers. If successful, this project will provide an innovative technology solution to the paramount long-
standing issues of pulse EPR spectroscopy such as increasing both the excitation bandwidth and sensitivity at
higher EPR frequencies. This will lead to a broader applicability of pulse EPR methods across the fields of
biochemistry and structural biology."
10862866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is accompanied by racial/ethnic disparities, but etiological factors
promoting the T2D epidemic and T2D disparities are not fully understood. Growing experimental evidence shows
that exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
promote T2D development, likely in synergy with known risk factors such as genetic variations. PFAS are
ubiquitous and persistent chemicals that perturb metabolism. However, few prospective studies examined the
association between PFAS and T2D risk, and those were almost exclusively in White populations. Previous
studies also lacked clinically ascertained T2D diagnosis, investigated only a few of the many potentially
hazardous PFAS, and did not examine potential effects of PFAS mixtures or gene–PFAS interactions. State-of-
the-art integrated omics approaches can overcome these barriers to advance the field. We propose the first
integrated metabolome–genome approach to (1) characterize the associations between PFAS concentrations
(individual PFAS and mixtures) in prediagnostic plasma samples and incident T2D risk and potential effect
modification by genetic predisposition to T2D using polygenic risk scores as an innovative solution for studying
interactions, (2) identify underlying dysregulated metabolic pathways, and (3) identify metabolic signatures in
prediagnostic plasma samples defined by EDC exposures and endogenous metabolites associated with T2D
risk. We will perform a nested case–control study leveraging BioMe, an ongoing electronic health record-linked
biobank with >55,000 participants enrolled while seeking primary care at Mount Sinai Hospital (NY) since 2007.
Incident T2D cases are matched (1:1) to BioMe T2D-free controls (N = 1,700) and are of African American,
Hispanic and White ancestry, with ~6 years average time between blood draw and T2D diagnosis. We will use
prediagnostic plasma to measure PFAS and metabolic pathways using state-of-the-art high-resolution
metabolomics (HRM) approaches. We will replicate findings among incident T2D cases and matched controls
from the population-based Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study in Los Angeles and Hawaii with extant genome data
and prediagnostic plasma concentrations of PFAS and HRM measured at the same lab as BioMe samples. In
contrast to prior studies, we incorporate a wide suite of legacy and emerging PFAS, exposure-mixture effects,
and gene–environment interactions by leveraging state-of-the-art metabolome–genome approaches and a
rigorous discovery–replication design in two unique, well-phenotyped multiethnic cohorts with prediagnostic
plasma samples to identify early biomarkers associated with T2D. This research relies on a multidisciplinary
team of seasoned investigators with expertise in environmental/genetic epidemiology, PFAS and T2D research,
and state-of-the-art HRM, genomics, and biostatistical exposure–mixture methods. Findings will inform precision
medicine approaches for T2D prevention and treatment, particularly for high-risk multiethnic populations."
10862718,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Acute and chronic pancreatitis afflict millions of individuals in the US. Mouse models have revealed that acinar
cells can de-differentiate after pancreatic injury to a progenitor-like cell type with ductal characteristics in a
process termed acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). In the absence of oncogenic mutations, ADM lesions can
resolve and reform the acinar compartment. However, in the presence of oncogenic Kras mutations, the ADM
lesions can continue to de-differentiate to a pre-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). The
mechanisms that drive PanIN formation in the context of injury and oncogenic mutations are poorly understood,
resulting in an absence of targets to combat the persistent ADM.
We have identified previously through bulk ATAC-sequencing that the transcription factor Fra1 is differentially
active only in the context of mutant Kras and acute inflammation. We have also generated a unique mouse
model expressing inducible mutant KRAS (iKras) and Fra1 loxp alleles (Fra1 KO) in a pancreatic epithelial-
specific manner. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that Fra1 loss attenuates ADM formation and
stromagenesis compared to the FRA1 WT controls. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how
FRA1 and its interacting partners, which constitute the AP-1 complex, govern ADM progression in the context of
mutant Kras and inflammation. My hypothesis is that FRA1 is a central mediator of ADM. I will investigate
the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects driving FRA1 activation through the following
interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Investigate how Fra1 remodels chromatin in ADM after induction of
pancreatitis; (2) Elucidate the role of fibroblast-secreted G-CSF in Fra1 induction during pancreatitis. I
will use novel mouse models, ex vivo 3D acinar and ADM cell cultures, and state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing
and chromatin precipitation assays to conduct this study. This proposal also encompasses a translational aspect
by proposing G-CSFR as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, this
project incorporates aspects of pathophysiology, molecular/cellular biology, and quantitative data analysis. This
proposal provides me with a robust foundation in both experimental and quantitative analysis and broadens my
fundamental knowledge of pancreatic epithelial cell homeostasis and plasticity.
With the guidance from experienced mentors (Drs. Rustgi and Sims), my advisory committee and the rich array
of resources at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, I will be able to complete my predoctoral PhD training.
Completion of this critical milestone will set the stage for my long-term goal as a physician-scientist who conducts
basic and translational research in an academic medical center with a focus on tissue inflammation, cellular
identity and plasticity, and tissue regeneration."
10862722,"Project Summary
 Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-30% of children and
approximately 5% of adults in industrialized countries. However, effective treatments to prevent and treat
this skin disease are lacking due in part to an incomplete understanding of the disease. The human
pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has been linked to AD pathogenesis because more than 90% of AD
patients are colonized in the lesional skin with the pathogen. Although S. aureus can produce multiple
virulence factors, the mechanism by which S. aureus virulence contributes to AD remains unknown. Using
a recently developed mouse model of epicutaneous S. aureus infection that resembles that observed in AD
flares, we found that activation of the S. aureus accessory gene regulatory (Agr) quorum-sensing system
induces the release of keratinocyte alarmins to trigger skin inflammation. We hypothesize that S. aureus
Agr virulence factors play a critical role in skin inflammation associated with AD.
We propose three Aims to test our hypotheses: 1) Use a novel AD mouse model to study the role of S.
aureus in skin inflammation; 2) Determine the mechanism of S. aureus colonization in the skin and
upregulation of Agr expression in lesional skin using the AD-like mouse model; 3) Examine the expression
of S. aureus Agr virulence genes in lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients and the function of AD-
associated S. aureus in skin inflammation. These studies will provide critical insight into AD pathogenesis
that will help the development of new approaches to treat AD.
The candidate is a basic immunologist and Research Investigator at the University of Michigan. Under the
guidance of his mentors and advisory team, he will acquire new knowledge and research expertise to test
the hypothesis that both S. aureus Agr virulence and skin factors are important for triggering skin
inflammation in AD using a newly developed AD model. The research proposed in his K01 application is a
new scientific challenge in his career that offers the opportunities to integrate clinical and translational
experience with his comprehensive training in basic science. Dr. Matsumoto's career development goals
will be supported through close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team, advanced didactic coursework,
attendance at professional meetings and workshops, participation in regular seminars, guidance in
manuscript preparation and grant proposal development. This training and research activities will provide
him with the necessary skills and experience needed to become a successful independent translational
investigator."

10858211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a prevalent gastrointestinal condition that leads to a significant number of
hospitalizations and high healthcare costs. With no effective therapy currently available, there is an urgent
need for research to develop successful treatments. This proposal aims to investigate the roles of trypsin
and coagulation in the development of acute pancreatitis and explore the hypothesis that thrombin plays a
crucial role in the disease.
Previous studies have shown that thrombin, a dual thrombin and trypsin inhibitor, has superior effects in
preventing and treating acute pancreatitis compared to selective trypsin inhibitors. This suggests that anti-
trypsin and anti-coagulation mechanisms work together to combat the disease. To investigate this further,
genetic approaches will be used, including a newly engineered trypsin knockout mouse model (T2457) and
a conditional thrombin knockout mouse model.
The research will focus on dissecting the roles of trypsin and coagulation in acute pancreatitis initiation and
progression. Additionally, the impact of thrombin on the pancreatic microenvironment will be examined
using a multi-photon intravital imaging system. Thrombin inhibitors, PAR receptor inhibitors, and PAR1
knockout mice will be utilized to gain a better understanding of the coagulation pathway's influence on
acute pancreatitis.
In the final aim, the project will concentrate on enhancing drug delivery to the inflamed pancreas,
addressing the issue of low drug concentrations in the affected tissue. Dabigatran will be used as a model
drug, and proof-of-principle studies will be conducted to develop pancreatitis-specific drugs that improve
drug delivery. An intravenous formulation of dabigatran will be formulated and tested for therapeutic
efficacy, along with two prodrugs designed to activate locally in the pancreas.
The completion of this project will significantly advance the understanding of acute pancreatitis
pathophysiology and contribute to the development of targeted therapies. The knowledge gained will
provide a solid foundation for future clinical trials aimed at preventing and treating acute pancreatitis.
Ultimately, this research has the potential to impact patient outcomes and improve the management of this
challenging condition."
10858302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a growing body of evidence that the allergic immune response is directed toward ectoparasites,
like it is helminths (endoparasites), possibly playing a central role in the phenomenon known as acquired
tick resistance. We hypothesize that human immunity naturally develops following recurrent tick bites,
involves IgE antibodies that target tick salivary proteins, and can result in either IgE-mediated disease
(alpha-gal syndrome) and/or protection from subsequent bites. At the center of the IgE-mediated immune
response is the IgE antibody molecule. In sensitized individuals, re-exposure to the offending antigen
results in IgE engagement, causing Fcε receptor cross-linking and activation of mast cells and basophils.
This triggers the release of mediators into the local tissue, resulting in the mass influx of basophils and
eosinophils. A novel way to study allergic immunity is to use naturally occurring human IgE monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs), isolated from allergic or parasite exposed subjects. We have established a method to
grow, identify and immortalize ultra-rare IgE encoding memory B cells by making human hybridomas
from the peripheral blood of allergic and parasitized individuals. Using our technology, we will generate
IgE mAbs from human subjects with alpha-gal syndrome and/or have received numerous recurrent tick
bites in Aim 1. We believe that IgE expressing B cell clones targeting tick salivary antigens are present
and can be captured from human subjects exposed to tick bites as part of their natural defense against
parasites. Already our preliminary data shows this to be the case, humans exposed to tick bites develop
IgE antibodies to tick salivary antigens. We will in Aim 2 identify, express, and validate the specific tick
salivary protein targeted by each tick-specific human IgE antibody through immunoprecipitation and
proteomics analyses using partially fed tick salivary extracts. We believe that alpha-gal is a very small
fraction of the antigens that the human IgE antibody response is targeting when one is bitten repeatably
by ticks and exposed to their salivary proteins. We will use these human mAbs and their tick salivary
antigens in Aim 3 to characterize the role IgE plays in immunity to tick bites using murine models of
passive systemic anaphylaxis and active tick feeding challenges. Analyses of the bite wound infiltrates
and rates of tick feeding success will allow for careful direct measures of the IgE-mediated immune
response between experimental and control animals. To begin studies to understand human immunity to
ticks, we first must define the dominant immune targets that could allow for interruption of tick feeding
and perhaps pathogen transmission. This work will have tremendous implications in studies of
pathogenesis and immunity of tickborne diseases, such as establishing correlates of protection against tick
feeding in humans, and indirectly, the transmission of infectious pathogens and disease."

There are over 7,300 heart failure patients listed for a transplant in the US, but in 2022, only 35% received one
and hundreds died or became too sick to remain eligible. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine (NASEM) has called for innovations to increase organ availability and longevity. Donation after
circulatory death (DCD) could increase heart availability by up to 30%. However, organs recovered from DCD
donors incur injury due to “ischemic time” – the duration of time an organ is without blood circulation. Ischemic
injury can lead to worse outcomes for recipients of DCD organs compared to recipients of organs recovered
after death by neurologic criteria. Organ injury from ischemic time can be mitigated by perfusion technologies,
either in situ thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) via extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) initiation, or ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of individual organs after
surgical extraction.
NRP might enable more high-quality transplants than NMP because all organs can be functionally evaluated
during NRP, and because the less resource-intensive NRP protocol can be implemented more broadly.
Although at least 26 US transplant programs have implemented NRP for DCD, many programs have yet to
adopt NRP due to ethical concerns about restarting circulation, including heartbeat, inside the donor’s body. In
DCD cases, the Uniform Determination of Death Act requires the irreversible cessation of circulatory and
respiratory functions. Because NRP restarts circulation and restores cardiac function in situ, there is concern
that the donor’s death declaration is invalidated. If the donor is not dead, then recovering these organs might
violate the Dead Donor Rule, the ethics principle that requires patients to be dead before removing life-
sustaining organs. These concerns about NRP could potentially jeopardize public trust in the organ transplant
system. We must understand public perceptions toward NRP to know whether its practice could put the
public’s delicate trust in organ transplantation at risk.
The objective of the proposed study is to understand how NRP affects public trust in the organ transplantation
system, and to inform guidelines for how to ethically explain NRP to donor family members who are
approached to authorize organ donation. We first aim to conduct an environmental scan of how procurement
staff request authorization for organ donation involving NRP by surveying and interviewing stakeholders from
all 56 Organ Procurement Organizations. We then aim to assess donor family and public perceptions of the
ethical basis for NRP by conducting focus groups with donor families and a national survey. Lastly, we aim to
use the Delphi method to reach consensus among experts and disseminate ethics guidelines for explaining
NRP to donor family members. Our ethics guidelines will help the 147 heart transplant programs and 56 OPOs
across the nation to decide whether to perform NRP and how to approach family members to promote trust
and transparency in organ donation."

Among the 10.6 million persons estimated to develop tuberculosis (TB) disease each year, ~40% are never
notified to public health programs, leading to delays in treatment and increased TB transmission and mortality.
Current diagnostics for pulmonary TB require microbiologic testing of sputum specimens, which is often
unavailable in primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries, where most TB disease occurs.
Further, clinicians lack reliable measures of TB disease severity and treatment response, limiting their ability to
individualize treatment regimens and duration. There is a tremendous need for rapid, point-of-care, biomarker-
based tests that can be performed on easily obtained clinical samples (e.g., blood or urine) to diagnose TB
disease and monitor response to treatment. However, the lack of effective TB biomarkers is a critical limitation
to developing a new generation of point-of-care TB diagnostics. To address key knowledge gaps, this research
will examine the use of high-resolution plasma immunometabolic profiling, defined as simultaneous measurement
of plasma metabolites, oxylipins, and cytokines, to discover plasma molecular biomarker signatures with potential
for translation to point-of-care tests to diagnose and manage TB disease. The Specific Aims of this proposal are
to: (1) determine the plasma immunometabolic biomarker signatures that most accurately identify persons with
pulmonary TB disease in a population of adults referred for TB evaluation; (2) determine the accuracy of plasma
immunometabolic signatures to assess disease severity in persons with pulmonary TB; and (3) determine
whether plasma immunometabolic signatures can predict treatment response and risk of relapse in persons with
TB disease. The aims of this project will be achieved by enrolling a cohort of patients at the time of TB diagnosis
and following them prospectively during treatment and for 1-year post-TB treatment. Plasma immunometabolic
signatures will be compared in persons with pulmonary TB disease versus persons with TB symptoms in whom a
diagnosis of TB is ultimately excluded. We will further elucidate plasma molecular signatures associated with
pulmonary TB disease severity as measured by the extent of lung involvement of disease including cavitation on
computed tomography imaging of the chest. Serial plasma samples will be measured during TB treatment to
determine the molecular signatures that predict time to sputum culture conversion, as well as treatment failure
and relapse. The analyses will include multiple modeling strategies to select the plasma biomarkers that most
accurately identify each clinical outcome, with validation in banked plasma samples from geographically diverse
TB cohorts. This proposal will directly address the lack of effective clinical TB biomarkers to improve TB
diagnostics and promote a precision medicine approach to TB treatment by identifying markers of disease
severity and treatment response. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to create point-of-care tests based
on host immunometabolic biomarker signatures that allow clinicians in practice settings without a laboratory to
diagnose TB disease, assess disease severity, and monitor response to treatment."

Unlike many infectious diseases, naturally acquired immunity against Plasmodium do not represent durable
sterilizing immunity. While the gradual acquisition of protective or clinical immunity following repeat infections is
a solace for people living in endemic regions, these symptom-less carriers become critical reservoirs of the
pathogen, facilitating inadvertent transmission. The overarching goal of our research program is to identify
molecular and cellular immune mechanisms and targets that are in play during the pathogenesis of malaria
resulting in suboptimal immune response that fails to induce sterilizing immunity and to devise
immunomodulatory host-directed interventions against this life-threatening disease. Our recent observations
point towards some key pathophysiological features of the disease contributing to this dysregulated and
suboptimal induction of humoral immune response. This project revolves around the central hypothesis that
systemic hypoxia subsequent to malaria-induced hemolytic anemia induces the expression of TAM receptors on
B cells to drive the accumulation of extrafollicular plasmablasts, that in turn exercise an immunosuppressive
function by acting as a nutrient sink. This proposal employs a combination of genetic, biochemical and bone
marrow chimeric approaches to investigate the potential of interrupting the hypoxia-TAM receptors(s)-
plasmablast-nutrient sink axis to improve the overall quality and magnitude of anti-Plasmodium humoral immune
response. In this proposal we also plan to repurpose an immunostimulatory drug, in stage 2 clinical trials that
block AXL, one of the TAM receptors and to investigate how AXL deficiency/blockade may reprogram
Plasmodium specific germinal center B cells by inducing transcriptional and epigenetic changes. By successfully
completing the experiments proposed in this project, we hope to discern (i) the precise mechanism by which
TAM receptor govern the differentiation of plasmablasts (ii) how the pathophysiology of the disease (such as
anemia) itself can alter the immune landscape and (iii) the different interventions to optimize the immune
response to harness its full potential."

Morphogens such as sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid form gradients that pattern the apex-to-base axis of the
mammalian and avian embryonic cochlea, thereby resulting in differential hair cell size and stereociliary
organization. Although much has been learned about how these individual gradients are established, how they
are integrated and translated into region-specific characteristics at the cellular level remains unclear. Therefore,
the objective of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms that encode tonotopic identity at the
transcriptional and epigenetic levels. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hedgehog signaling acts
upstream of a cascade involving retinoic acid, miRNAs, and the chromatin modifier HMGA2, thus imprinting
positional information in the cochlea. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims will be pursued. First, the
hypothesis that hedgehog signaling controls retinoic acid signaling activity will be tested by mapping the retinoic
acid signaling activity in hedgehog gain or loss of function experiments. Furthermore, hedgehog effectors (GLI1-
3) will be classified into transcriptional activators and repressors, and GLI target genes will be identified through
a gene regulatory network analysis. Also, genes modulating retinoic acid activity among the hedgehog targets,
such as Cyp26b1, will be identified using a hedgehog loss of function paradigm. Second, the hypothesis that
retinoic acid induces expression of miRNAs, thus shaping opposing mRNA gradients will be tested. Initial
experiments will determine whether let7 is a critical factor in shaping the cochlear Hmga2 gradient by blocking
of specific let7 family members. Next, miRNAs and mRNAs among the retinoic acid regulated genes will be
identified by using a retinoic acid loss of function allele. Third, the hypothesis that HMGA2 controls tonotopic
maturation of postnatal HCs will be tested. Initially, the temporal requirement for Hmga2 in hearing acquisition
will be determined by deletion of Hmga2 before and after the onset of hearing. Cell type specific functions for
Hmga2 will be elucidated by characterizing hearing and cell type specific markers upon conditional loss of Hmga2
in prosensory progenitors and hair cells. Finally, the impact of HMGA2 on the chromatin landscape will be
determined upon conditional deletion of Hmga2. Our expected outcomes after successful completion of the
proposed project include comprehensive characterization of the gene regulatory network mediating apex-to-base
patterning in the cochlea. The results should explain the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms guiding
tonotopic development in the auditory periphery. Learning how the auditory sensor is constructed will be critical
to enable future studies, including those aimed at regenerating lost hearing."

More than 1.3 million new patients are diagnosed each year with neurological conditions that may result in ele-
vated intracranial pressure (ICP). In these patients, the limited ability to make accurate, stable pressure meas-
urements with wireless, MRI compatible devices contributes to poor clinical outcomes. It is hypothesized that a
novel ultrasound-based wireless transduction approach combined with an implanted pressure-sensitive target
has the potential to nearly eliminate drift, improving patient management. Long recognized as an unaddressed
clinical need, implanted pressure sensors that measure intracranial pressure have been proposed since the
1950’s. Unfortunately, nearly all neuro sensors rely on the same underlying technology: a thin membrane that
can deflect directly adjacent to a sealed air chamber or vacuum. Due to the size scales involved and the material
constraints with traditional radio-frequency approaches, all of these devices experience drift as air or water vapor
diffuse across the thin membrane and/or induce stress in packaging materials. This fundamentally limits the
usefulness of these devices. As an example, the gold standard implanted pressure sensor for neurosurgeons,
the Codman Microsensor ICP Transducer is wired, MRI conditional, and has an average drift of 1 mm Hg over
1 week. While recent innovations have led to the development of fiber optic-based sensors and even dissolvable
sensors, these devices still rely on the same fundamental approach, and do not address the need for long-term
stable sensors. This proposal seeks to advance a new approach to clinical testing: using ultrasound to transduce
information from an implanted microsystems target.
Our novel approach combines: 1) a novel MRI compatible pressure sensor “target” filled with liquids and air that
move in response to pressure, and 2) an ultrasound-based platform that can image the movement of this air and
liquid, thereby enabling a quantitative measurement of pressure. In the target, a thin membrane adjacent to a
liquid-filled chamber deflects in response to pressure. This deflection causes a connected serpentine channel to
fill with liquid. Since air is easily visualized in the device with ultrasound due to the high acoustic impedance
mismatch, and since the air movement is proportional to pressure, this combined system creates an easy to read
quantitative pressure measurement. Therefore, this project aims to accomplish the following:
Aim 1: Development and long-term in vitro testing of membrane-based pressure micro-sensor ultrasound target.
Aim 2: Develop ultrasound-based readout of passive implanted pressure sensor.
Aim 3: Validate in vivo implant procedure and sensor integrity in acute and multi-week porcine models.
When complete, a new class of ultra-stable, testable, long-term ICP pressure sensors will be available to quan-
titatively monitor patients at risk of elevated intracranial pressure. This will spare patients from inconclusive im-
aging studies or ICP sensors implanted in the brain with a cable or tube exiting the skull. More broadly, the new
paradigm of ultrasound telemetry of microfabricated targets can have wide usefulness in medical sensing."
10846630,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hypertension (HTN) is a chronic inflammatory disease and is a primary risk factor for ischemic heart
disease and stroke, the two leading causes of death worldwide. HTN is associated with vascular “oxidative
stress”, yet antioxidant therapy has not proven effective. This may be because reactive oxygen species (ROS)
also participate in normal physiological signaling by molecules like Angiotensin II (AngII) and tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα). Pathology may result from excess activation, loss of spatiotemporal constraints, or
dysregulation of the feedback mechanisms that control these signals. AngII and TNFα both activate NADPH
Oxidase 1 (Nox1), producing extracellular superoxide (O2-•). By an unknown mechanism, this generates an
intracellular signal, and disruption of this protects against vascular inflammation and AngII-induced HTN.
 We previously found that Nox1 physically associates with Volume-Regulated Anion Channels (VRACs) that
are encoded by Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing 8 family proteins. LRRC8A associates with one of four
related isoforms (LRRC8B-E) to produce channels with unique properties. ROS production by Nox1 requires
functional VRACs, potentially for change compensation, and the oxidized environment created by Nox1
regulates VRACs. Thus, VRACs and Nox1 are functionally interdependent. We now provide new evidence
that O2-• also enters cells via these closely associated anion channels. This may allow tight regulation of O2-•
delivery to the cytoplasm, providing spatial control of redox signaling which limits off-target oxidation.
 Blood vessels from mice lacking LRRC8A only in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exhibit normal
contractility but enhanced vasodilation and these mice are protected from AngII-induced HTN. We hypothesize
that by regulating Nox1 activity and O2-• entry into VSMCs, LRRC8 anion channels control cytoplasmic
redox signaling pathways that promote inflammation and impair vasodilation. Aim #1 will determine how
LRRC8 channels facilitate O2-• influx into VSMCs and determine how this is regulated by local redox conditions.
We will use two novel O2-• flux assays that we have developed combined with patch-clamp recording to achieve
these goals. Aim #2 will determine how LRRC8A channels and O2-• modulate inflammation and contractility via
two cytoplasmic targets: 1) RhoA, a small GTPase that controls vasomotor function, and 2) TRIM21, an E3
ubiquitin ligase that we identified by mass spectrometry as a novel binding partner of LRRC8A. TRIM21
modulates both NF-κB-dependent inflammation and the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response. Aim #3 will
define the contribution of specific LRRC8 isoforms to AngII-induced hypertension in mice. Blood pressure
recording, vascular reactivity and molecular biologic studies will define the LRRC8 channel subtype that
controls Nox1 and vascular function in HTN . Relevance: Links between inflammation, oxidative stress and
cardiovascular disease are clear, but methods to control oxidant-dependent signaling are lacking. This project
will identify novel therapeutic strategies that are applicable to the treatment of HTN and vascular inflammation."
10846631,"Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of diverse malignant hematological disorders that
originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA
damage are commonly detected in hematopoietic cells from MDS patients. An elevated level of ROS,
generated from either endogenous or exogenous sources including oncogene activation, leads to loss of
quiescence and self-renewal of HSCs. ROS-induced DNA damage speeds up the aging process of stem cells
and contributes to the mutagenesis associated with cancer development. m6A RNA methylation plays a
significant role in multiple biological processes by introducing another layer of post-transcriptional regulation of
gene expression within cells. The goal of this project is to elucidate the significant role of ALKBH5-mediated
epigenetic regulation in the maintenance of genomic stability in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPCs)
during oxidative stress, and how deregulation of ALKBH5 contributes to promotion of leukemic transformation
of HSPCs in the initiation and development of MDS. We found that ROS significantly increased global m6A
RNA methylation in human cell lines, and that the elevation of m6A mRNA methylation is required for rapidly
repairing ROS-induced DNA lesions and preventing cell death. Interestingly, we found that ALKBH5, the m6A
RNA demethylase, is responsible for ROS-induced elevation of m6A mRNA methylation. ROS induced post-
translational modification of ALKBH5, and inhibited the demethylase activity of ALKBH5. We showed that
forced expression of ALKBH5 inhibited ROS-induced m6A mRNA methylation and significantly delayed repair
of ROS-induced DNA damage. Thus, we hypothesize that aberrant expression of ALKBH5 disrupts HSPC
functions by negatively influencing genome integrity and survival of HSPCs, thereby contributing to leukemic
transformation of HSPCs during the initiation and development of MDS. In this proposal, we will determine 1)
the role and underlying mechanism of ALKBH5 in the maintenance of genomic stability in HSPCs in response
to oxidative stress; 2) the effects of ALKBH5/Alkbh5 overexpression on the maintenance of mouse and human
primary HSPCs during ROS stress in vivo; and 3) whether ALKBH5/Alkbh5 is required for the maintenance of
pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) in MDS. Our study will provide new insights into novel mechanisms of
MDS development and epitranscriptional regulation of gene expression in HSPCs in response to oxidative
stress. Additionally, our study will provide the first set of evidence to support a significant role of ALKBH5-
mediated m6A mRNA demethylation in the maintenance of normal HSPCs and pre-leukemic stem cell (pre-
LSCs)."

The central hypothesis of this work is that increased intestinal permeability (IP), either directly, or via
related comorbidities, promotes the development and worsening of multi-joint osteoarthritis (MJOA).
Multiple joint osteoarthritis (MJOA; referring to OA in more than one joint site within an individual) is common
but understudied. MJOA is progressive, and as whole-body burden of OA increases, associated pain and
disability increases, and treatments are less successful. Despite the significant societal impact of MJOA, most
OA research remains focused on individual joints. There is an urgent need to understand the factors that
promote progression and worsening of MJOA. To address our hypothesis, our group has access to a large,
longitudinal cohort of human patients, and, uniquely, access to the naturally occurring MJOA model in pet
dogs. There are no rodent models of MJOA, but dogs with naturally occurring MJOA have similar disease
manifestations with more rapid progression compared with humans, making pet dogs an ideal model in which
to explore underlying mechanisms of MJOA and potential therapies. We have shown that inflammatory
mediators are related to overall burden of OA; these and other risk factors may at least partly derive from the
gut microbiome via increased intestinal permeability (IP; “leaky gut”). We have evidence that
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP, reflecting increased IP and increased exposure to
microbial products), promote OA. Additionally, serum LPS in humans (and serum LBP in dogs) is positively
associated with the number of joints affected by MJOA. To further elucidate the role of IP as a mechanism in
MJOA, the proposed work will leverage human and dog studies: The JoCoOA, a longitudinal cohort of over
4000 Black and White men and women aged 45 and older; The Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), an
actively enrolling cohort (2019-, n~2000) including younger (35-70 years) and Hispanic individuals; and a large
cohort of readily accessible naturally occurring MJOA in pet dogs. Data from all three cohorts will be used to
address the following three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine cross-sectional associations between altered IP,
systemic inflammation, and radiographic and symptomatic MJOA in humans and pet dogs. Aim 2 will allow
identification of biomarkers predictive of development and worsening of MJOA and determine longitudinal
associations with markers of systemic inflammation and IP among JoCoOA participants and dogs. In Aim 3,
we will test the effects of a prebiotic on IP, the microbiome and MJOA symptoms by randomizing 70 dogs with
MJOA (from Aim 1) to receive either a fructooligosaccharide supplement or placebo for 3 months followed by
re-characterization of biomarkers of inflammation and IP. These studies will both verify the association
between increased IP and MJOA and robustly define biomarkers predictive of development and worsening
MJOA, laying the groundwork for mechanistic studies to understand how increased IP promotes MJOA and to
identify therapeutic targets, as well as provide means to identify at-risk individuals for preemptive management."

 Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the second most common cause of meningitis in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Neurologic disability and mortality are common, mortality is at least 50% in people with HIV. TBM diagnosis
remains difficult and diagnostic delay/missed diagnosis are major contributors to poor outcomes. Acid fast
bacilli smear of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is cheap and fast but with sensitivity of only ~10% in most settings.
CSF culture has improved sensitivity (~50-60%) but is slow, up to six weeks. Our studies on GeneXpert
MTB/Rif and the re-engineered GeneXpert MTB/Rif Ultra showed improved sensitivity (50-80%) with these
rapid (~2hrs) tests. Yet, these tests have inadequate negative predictive value to rule-out TBM, require
expensive instruments and cartridges, and their availability is inconsistent across the areas with the highest TB
incidence. Thus, alternative or additional tests for TBM remain crucial needs to improve outcomes.
 A previous lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen test (Alere) had only ~20% sensitivity in CSF. Our study of
the SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) assay in CSF found 52% sensitivity in definite or probable TBM compared to
55% for Xpert Ultra yet this study was small and requires confirmation. Of the 58 cases of definite or probable
TBM, six were positive by FujiLAM but not Xpert Ultra. Eight were positive by Xpert Ultra but not FujiLAM. This
study was unable to systematically and thoroughly address cases that were possibly false by FujiLAM. Further,
formal cost-benefit analysis for this test, and other important tests for TBM has not been done. Given that cost
remains a major limitation in accessing TB diagnostic tests, the lack of research in this area is problematic.
 Our overall objective is to reduce mortality and morbidity due to TBM by improving diagnostic accuracy,
rapidity, and cost-effectiveness. To accomplish these objectives, the aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine
the accuracy of SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) in CSF to diagnose TBM in comparison to uniform TBM case
definitions; 2) Determine whether positive SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) tests without corroboration by other
TBM tests are false or true positives, using autopsy and metagenomics next generation sequencing; and 3)
Determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of TBM diagnostic testing strategies, including FujiLAM and
GeneXpert MTB/Rif Ultra.
 The first two aims focus on better defining the diagnostic accuracy of FujiLAM, an easy to use, rapid test,
that requires limited technological infrastructure or expertise. The third aim focuses on cost-effectiveness of
this test and other commonly used tests. These studies will impact clinical practice by better informing our
understanding of the diagnostic tools for TBM. This proposal has the potential to shift the paradigm of TBM
diagnosis to two rapid tests, FujiLAM and Xpert Ultra, influencing international WHO guidelines while providing
valuable costing data for stake holders and ministries of health to consider investment and implementation."

 Almost half of American adults have a preventable chronic disease, most of which could be improved
with regular physical activity (PA). These proportions are even higher for racially/ethnically diverse populations
where disparities emerge in both chronic disease and PA behavior. Importantly, adults with ~20 minutes/day of
physical activity have a 33% lower risk for all-cause mortality than those who are inactive We know that
physical activity patterns for adults have their developmental beginnings in childhood. Although we know
roughly when, specifically how to affect these patterns is multi-factorial. Direct “cause and effect” models are
insufficient to accommodate the layers of complexity involved in pattern formation. Such complexity includes
multiple dynamic systems with inter- and intra- interactions that influence children’s PA behaviors, including the
built environment, the social environment (both inside and outside the home), and cognitive processes that vary
during- child development. Providing a deeper understanding of these dynamics can advance interventions and
policies for childhood PA behaviors and long-term health disparities reduction.
 To accomplish this task, we will leverage approaches more commonly used outside of biomedical
research, in fields such as ecology and social science, and bring together a trans-disciplinary and cross-sector
team of experts in complex systems modeling approaches (Brookings Institution) and pediatric PA and health
disparities (Vanderbilt) to build an etiologic Agent-Based Model (ABM) that identifies which modifiable
determinants may have the biggest impact on PA pattern formation for diverse young children. This project will
utilize an independent dataset collected by the Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW) Trial of child-parent pairs
to inform the ABM. All of these families represented diverse under-served populations in Tennessee. The GROW
Trial (total N=610 children ages 3-8) collected detailed objective PA data (via accelerometry) at four annual time-
points over the study period (for child-parent pairs), as well as data on the child’s social environment, built
environment, and cognitive processes. Using ABM in this context leverages the diversity and richness of this
longitudinal dataset to build a model with empirically derived parameter estimates to generate new insights into
supporting early childhood PA in diverse populations. ABMs allows us to examine how, when, and for whom
PA behaviors are dynamically shaped by macro-level influences such as the built environment in which
children reside, meso-level influences such as social environments both in and out of the home, and micro-level
influences such as individual cognitive processes in early childhood development. We will examine the potential
heterogeneity in these influences across child characteristics including gender, race/ethnicity, BMI, and BMI
change over time. The result of this project will be a set of data-driven policy recommendations, based
on a complex systems approach to studying childhood PA behaviors, that can be applied in real-world
community settings."

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a lethal, incurable disease that will kill ~33,500
patients in the US in 2020. Responding to the urgent need for novel treatments that are safe and efficacious,
and leveraging the high expression of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in mCRPC lesions, several
small-molecule-based targeted radionuclide therapies (TRTs) have been developed. Among them, targeted
alpha therapy agent (TAT) with [225Ac]-PSMA-617 in particular has demonstrated striking responses in the
treatment of refractory patients — even achieving complete and durable responses in a subset of patients.
However, many responding patients have discontinued treatment due to non-target toxicity. Salivary gland
toxicity (irreversible xerostomia) and potential renal toxicity place hard limits on patient eligibility, maximum dose
and maximum number of doses, severely restricting the use of [225Ac]-PSMA-617. As such, there is an urgent
and unmet need to develop strategies that can reduce the unwanted side effects of these treatments without
compromising treatment efficacy. We in turn are proposing a simple method to reduce salivary gland and kidney
toxicity by reducing the effective specific activity (ESA) of [225Ac]-PSMA-617 by addition of PSMA-11. In our
preliminary studies, reducing the ESA of [68Ga]-PSMA-11 and [177Lu]-PSMA-617 with PSMA-11 led to
significantly reduced salivary gland and kidney uptake without compromising tumor uptake in mouse models of
prostate cancer. We have assembled a highly qualified and collaborative team of researchers — including
radiochemists, medical physicists, nuclear medicine physicians, genitourinary oncologists, veterinary
pathologists and toxicologists — to unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology for reducing the
salivary gland and renal radiation dose of [225Ac]-PSMA-617 or other PSMA-TRT agents in clinically relevant
mouse and rat models. As part of our proposal, we will determine the range of ESAs that will reduce salivary
gland and kidney dose of [225Ac]-PSMA-617 by > 75% without compromising tumor radiation dose in mice and
rats; demonstrate that salivary gland and renal function are maintained long-term(~2 years post-treatment) while
eliminating tumor burden; demonstrate the methodology’s applicability to other PSMA-TRT agents; conduct a
GLP toxicology study of PSMA-11 at required doses (5–10 mgs/patient) to establish its safety; and make the
data available to all researchers in order to facilitate clinical trials. The experiments are being conducted as IND-
enabling studies for near-term clinical translation. Once established, our simple but innovative approach will
refine treatment with [225Ac]-PSMA-617 and other PSMA-TRT agents by reducing toxicity to salivary glands and
kidneys without compromising treatment efficacy and help to extend the lives of mCRPC patients while
maintaining their quality of life."

RE: Development and Maintenance of Human and Animal Food Rapid Response Teams (U2F)
Clinical Trials Not Allowed (Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number RFA-FD-23-
019).
Kentucky has seen a rise in the number of foodborne outbreaks, activations, and recalls (on a national level). In
order to maintain our current RRT structure, which is designed to rapidly detect and respond to foodborne
outbreaks and other activation events, we are seeking continued funding to support maintenance and
enhancement of our state RRT program. Specific priorities during the 2023-2026 Period of Performance will be to
extend support and develop our efforts to rapidly detect outbreaks and respond to additional activation events in
order to protect public health. Maintain and further develop our state’s new food complaint system so our RRT
program can effectively and comprehensively identify and respond to previously undetected outbreaks.
Kentucky’s RRT structure includes a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary team that operates using Incident Command
System (ICS)/National Incident Management System (NIMS) principles and a Unified Command structure to
respond to human and animal food emergencies. Our agency aims to maintain the written framework for KY RRT
SOPs and MOUs, update our sustainability assessment, continue organizing meetings focused on improvement
with RRT team members and mentors, and learn from outbreaks to better respond to future events. To further
the innovation, integration, and national capacity development, the KY RRT Program will utilize federal funding to
continue collaborating with state partners in the development of Food Complaint Systems (FCS) modeled after the
KY FCS. The KY RRT Program also intends to schedule multiple training and outreach events with stakeholders in
order to increase our capability to respond to human and animal food emergencies.
The KY RRT program will enhance data sharing capacities by gathering and sharing foodborne outbreak data with
relevant KY regulatory agencies and our state/federal partners in order to protect Public Health. Outbreak data
will also be shared with local health departments (LHDs) to heighten responsiveness. Funding from this grant
opportunity is aimed at supporting state and national prevention efforts, in that KY RRT will enter data obtained
from LHD investigations into the National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) while our
Epidemiology partners enter data into the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). The KY RRT Program will
communicate its impact through outreach by providing annual presentations at the local, state, and national level
to meet the requirements detailed in the Funding Opportunity Announcement."

One of the greatest challenges facing biomedical sciences is the development of fundamentally better treatments
for neurodegenerative diseases. Natural History studies (NHS) are critical to enhance our understanding of the
disease, find external matching controls, identify people living with rare and ultra-rare forms of the diseases, and
bring them into clinical research ecosystem.
The heterogeneity of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases complicates predictions of disease progression
and development of potential therapies, making clinical trials challenging. Uncertainty surrounding prognosis is
an enormous burden for people with ALS and their families. Implementing better models to identify and recruit
people living with ultra-rare forms of diseases like ALS with known genetic mutations or PLS is essential.
“Traditional” models of NHS in ultra-rare diseases are not effective, as participating in NHS research sites are
being selected first, while people living with those conditions may not be attending the preselected clinics.
While the Food and Drug Administration encourages the use of approaches and technologies to minimize the
burden of trials on patients and limit the need for travel to study sites and is open to exploring the utility of digital
biomarkers as clinical endpoints, implementation of such methods as decentralized clinical research with key
endpoint measures at baseline and at intervals during the trial conducted in a standardized fashion at central
testing facilities, remote monitoring for some of the visits, etc. are not utilized broadly..
We propose a decentralized model for the NHS conduct, in which we implement a disease-agnostic people-
centric Platform, NeuroPRO™, for recruitment and e-consent study participants, diagnosis confirmation, and
baseline data acquisition. This Platform will be used to:
 • Conduct a stand-alone decentralized longitudinal NHS utilizing digital biomarkers and periodic home or
 nearest clinical hubs visits.
 • Conduct a hybrid NHS, in which this people-centric platform may serve either as an equal partner to a
 “traditional” NHS (ALS/MND Natural History Study), or as participants identification and recruitment tool,
 while clinical outcomes are still being measured during clinical visits, or as also an optimization tool for
 participating sites selection based on geographical distribution of recruited participants (PLS Natural
 History Study).
 • Provide regulatory compliant environment for rapid simultaneous validation of digital biomarkers against
 widely utilized outcomes.
The data from the studies will be anonymized and shared with the medical research community."
10850954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
About half of children in the U.S. experience parental divorce prior to age 16. Parental divorce confers risk for
various mental health problems and disorders throughout the lifespan that incur significant individual and
societal costs. Exposure to high levels of interparental conflict (IPC) accounts for much of this increased risk.
The high prevalence of parental divorce, its significant public health burden, and the strong link between IPC
and children's mental health problems highlight the importance of interventions that reduce post-
separation/divorce IPC. Many family courts mandate high-IPC separated/divorcing parents to attend
interventions but none of the currently implemented interventions has been rigorously evaluated. Although two
interventions have reduced IPC in divorced families in randomized controlled trials, neither has been adopted
as a service by family courts, and thus are not reaching high-IPC parents. The current project represents a
foundational step toward reducing the public health burden of parental divorce by developing and testing a
scalable intervention to reduce IPC. It will use an established adaptation framework and human-centered
design (HCD) methods to develop a relevant, useful, and engaging intervention for high-IPC parents that will
be adopted and sustained by family courts. The project will adapt strategies from the two rigorously evaluated
interventions that have reduced IPC; follow an established framework for adapting interventions; use HCD,
which has been shown to improve effects and scalability of psychosocial interventions; and use state-of-the-art
analytic techniques. We will analyze results from a survey of family court judges and administrators to
determine the intervention format (i.e., digital, in-person, hybrid). In semi-structured interviews and focus groups,
court-based service providers and high-IPC parents will provide qualitative and quantitative data about the
intervention content and engagement strategies. These data will be used to develop a prototype of the intervention.
Input from an advisory board, which consists of a judge, an administrator, a service provider, and four parents, and
data from user testing sessions with parents and service providers will be used to refine the intervention. The
randomized pilot will consist of parents mandated by judges to attend the new intervention or the existing court
program. Parents will opt in or out of the research component. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used
to collect data on acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and usability as well as parents' use of the
intervention skills. Before and after participation, parents will complete questionnaires on IPC and child mental
health problems. The specific aims are to: 1) Use HCD methods to develop an intervention that fits with the
family court and is contextually appropriate for high-IPC separated/divorcing parents and 2) Pilot test the
intervention with high-IPC families ordered to attend by the court. This proposal advances NIMH's strategic
plan (3.2, 4.2), which encourages investigators to adapt existing interventions to optimize outcomes and
leverage effective research-practice partnerships with stakeholders to develop scalable interventions."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating neuro-degenerative disease that causes visual impairment in young, middle aged
and older adults with resulting substantial lost productivity and cost to society. Current thinking attributes vision loss in
MS to death and dysfunction of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that comprise the optic nerve. However, there is only
weak correlation between visual function and RGC atrophy, and some patients without RGC atrophy have vision loss,
suggesting that all relevant contributors to vision loss in MS have not been identified. We have discovered structural
features in the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) of retinas of the majority people with MS and a minority of people with
glaucoma that cast a shadow on the photoreceptor layer and correlate with visual function. Our discovery contributes to
addressing gaps in understanding visual pathway involvement in MS, offering new windows into diagnosis and treatment
of vision loss in MS. This project studies the recently discovered FAZ features in retinas of people with MS and related
diseases using adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy, a high resolution, non-invasive, state-of-the-art imaging
technique. In the first aim, the relationship between central visual function and FAZ features will be defined using MS as
an experimental model. Advanced microperimetry will be used to test the hypothesis that photoreceptor shadowing is
the mechanism of vision loss. In the second aim the cause and composition of the FAZ features will be inferred through
longitudinal studies of people with MS, cross sectional comparison between MS, glaucoma and related neurological and
ophthalmic diseases and histopathological study of ex-vivo MS eyes. In the third aim rapid imaging protocols will be
developed to enable faster detection of FAZ features and these will be applied to estimate the distributions of FAZ features
in the populations with MS, glaucoma, other diseases and controls. These observations will evaluate the candidacy of the
FAZ features as biomarkers of MS by defining specificity. The immediate impact of this research will be advancing
understanding of vision loss in MS, developing rapid imaging strategies to enable broader study of large sample sizes at
multiple sites and evaluating FAZ features as biomarkers in MS, glaucoma and other disease."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of irreversible visual dysfunction in older
individuals in developed countries, resulting in loss of productivity, independence, and quality of life, as well as
tremendous healthcare and economic burden. Visual dysfunction in AMD patients could be in the form of ‘‘dry’’
AMD or ‘‘wet’’ AMD or both. While some treatments are available for wet-AMD, but there is no effective treatment
for geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced form of dry-AMD. Oxidative stress-induced cellular changes play a
significant role in the loss of macular RPE and photoreceptors in dry-AMD. Treatments involving local and
sustained delivery of molecules or genes to counteract oxidative stress-induced cellular changes could prevent
RPE atrophy. Systemic or retinal delivery EPO-R76E, a modified form of EPO (with reduced erythropoietic
activity) improved the function of ganglion cells and photoreceptors cells in the retina. Because of its effect in
preventing cell death due to induction oxidative stress, we are especially interested in investigating the precise
mechanism(s) of how RPE specific EPO-R76E interacts with other retinal cells and influences aberrant molecular
pathways in controlling dry-AMD phenotype. We will interrogate the impact of EPO-R76E using two different
animal models showing AMD pathology; one is associated with induction of RPE oxidative stress, and the other
due to complement dysregulation. We will use recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) with serotype 1 to
achieve sustained expression of EPO-R76E and deliver to mice eye via subretinal injection. Our first aim will test
molecular mechanisms of the retinal protection by EPO-R76E using proteomics analyses of pathways and cell-
specific transcriptional approaches in a mouse model of dry-AMD. Our second aim will test whether sustained
expression of EPO-R76E ameliorates dry AMD phenotypes in animal models and interrogate how late in the
course of retinal degeneration EPO-R76E will be effective in preventing disease symptoms. Our research will
elucidate the role of EPO signaling in RPE function, retinal health, and the approach for preventive or therapeutic
intervention of dry-AMD. These studies will identify novel molecular pathways for manipulating the retina and
provide a new direction for managing dry-AMD."

10852056,"Project Summary – Technology and Data Core
The overall objective of the Michigan Infectious Disease Genomics (MIDGE) Center is the identification of
pathogen determinants of epidemic success. To accomplish this goal, each project will generate large genomic
compendia, and analyze them in the context of rich phenotypic measurements. The Technology and Data Core
(TDC) will support individual projects and the overall mission of MIDGE by providing intellectual capacity,
technical skill, and infrastructure to enable genomic and phenotypic data generation, analysis and
dissemination of data, resources, and results to the research community. The TDC is led by investigators with
expertise and experience in the generation and analysis of massive genomic data sets, performing high-
throughput phenotypic assays, and the integration of genomic and phenotypic data through advanced
phylogenetic analysis and microbial genome-wide association studies (mGWAS). In addition, the TDC includes
two technical staff with extensive experience in managing large and complex data sets, creating automated
workflows for data quality control, analysis and sharing and writing custom software solutions for both data
management and bioinformatic applications. With this leadership and technical knowhow, the TDC will fulfill the
following four objectives: i) facilitate genomic data generation, quality control and rapid dissemination of
cleaned sequence data, ii) provide capacity for extraction of genetic variation from cleaned sequencing data,
iii) provide support for laboratory automation, high-throughput phenotyping and integration of phenotypic and
genotypic data through advanced phylogenetic analysis and mGWAS, and iv) ensure consistent and uniform
sharing of data, protocols and software emanating from MIDGE. In fulfilling these objectives, the TDC will not
only provide direct support for all four research projects, but also act as a hub for the sharing of technical
knowledge and analysis pipelines across projects. Lastly, investigators and staff in the TDC will lend their
technical expertise in helping train team members across projects, which will enrich the training environment
associated with MIDGE, improve productivity, and ensure uniform standards and practices."
10852057,"Project Summary – Project 1 (Virus)
Respiratory viruses impose a significant public health burden, in large part due to their rapid evolution and ability
to evade host immunity. Influenza, COVID-19, and now RSV infection, are all vaccine-preventable diseases, yet
our current system of genomic surveillance is limited by significant knowledge gaps in forecasting new antigenic
drift mutations and remarkably little attention to determinants of within-host and population-level viral fitness
outside of antigenic sites. The long-term goal of this research is to advance the field of virus genomics by
improving inference of natural selection in genomic surveillance data. The core objective of this project is to
combine large-scale genomic surveillance and functional genomics to define determinants of epidemic success
in three respiratory viruses. Preliminary data demonstrate: (i) a system for genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-
2, influenza, and RSV across four major health systems in Michigan that serve a racially, geographically, and
socioeconomically diverse population; and (ii) Novel laboratory approaches to measuring an array of viral
phenotypes. This project will take an integrated bidirectional approach, in which genomic surveillance is used to
identify strains and mutations for experimental analysis, and in which functional genomics data are used to
improve population-level inference of adaptive viral evolution. Key knowledge gaps in forecasting antigenic drift
and selection elsewhere in the genome will be addressed in three specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a Bayesian
model to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations positively selected within hosts. A comprehensive dataset of fitness
values for amino acid substitutions in the Omicron spike protein will be used to parameterize a Bayesian model
for identifying positively selected mutations within hosts and applied to deep sequence data of serially sampled
individuals. (Aim 2) Use mutational antigenic profiling (MAP) of the RSV fusion (F) protein to define and anticipate
antigenic drift. High throughput MAP will precisely identify immune selection on all mutations in F, making it
possible to generate complete maps of antibody selection. Targeted epitopes and antibody escape mutations
will be compared using sera from unvaccinated adults with prior infection, vaccinated adults with prior infection,
and vaccinated pregnant women. (Aim 3) Leverage influenza virus genomic surveillance to identify determinants
of epidemic success. Phylodynamic models will be applied to regional whole genome surveillance data to identify
strains and mutations conferring a population-level fitness advantage. These will be further evaluated in
laboratory and animal models. This project is innovative because it will combine large-scale genomic surveillance
and functional genomics to define antigenic drift and other determinants of epidemic success in influenza virus,
SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. While different approaches are taken for each virus, they are universally applicable and
will advance the field. By addressing knowledge gaps for these three respiratory viruses, this project will provide
a foundation for more accurate prediction of emerging strains and the development of more protective vaccines."
10852058,"Project Summary – Project 2 (Bacteria)
Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has been designated as an urgent antibiotic resistance threat
by both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. The basis for
this notoriety is the propensity for CRE to cause outbreaks among vulnerable hospitalized patients, high
mortality rates for infected patients, and the emergence of strains of CRE that are resistant to virtually all
available antibiotics. The most problematic strains of CRE are those that have become carbapenem-resistant
via the acquisition of a carbapenemase gene that can cleave most beta-lactam antibiotics. These
carbapenemase genes are most often carried on plasmids, and through conjugation have disseminated widely
among diverse members of the Enterobacterales order. Given the great diversity of CRE observed in
healthcare settings, a critical need from a public health surveillance perspective is the ability to assess the risk
posed by a newly detected strain. We reason that the risk of a newly emerged CRE strain is dictated by: i) the
stability of its association with the carbapenemase containing plasmid, ii) it’s capacity to disseminate this
plasmid to other Enterobacterales, iii) the potential of the CRE strain to evolve resistance to additional front-line
antibiotics, and iv) its potential to colonize, infect and spread among vulnerable patient populations. We
present preliminary data that all four of these components of risk can vary among even closely related strains
of CRE isolated from patients. Motivated by this, in this project we will first experimentally quantify the variation
in these four determinants of risk in longitudinal collections of CRE collected from two healthcare networks in
the U.S. and employ bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS) to identify genetic variation
associated with each of these four phenotypes. Next, we will take advantage of the longitudinal nature our
sample collections, and the availability of relevant patient meta-data, to quantify the degree to which variation
in risk potential predicts patterns of CRE strain emergence, resistance evolution and spread. We expect this
project to contribute substantially to our understanding of how genetic variation in CRE influences its epidemic
potential. Looking forward, the ability to experimentally quantify the components of risk, and ultimately identify
genetic signatures of these phenotypes, would greatly enhance the capacity of public health genomic
laboratories to make proactive, instead of reactive risk assessments, and thereby contain emerging threats."
10851725,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is one of nine incurable neurodegenerative disorders caused by pathogenic
polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions. Although each polyQ neurodegenerative disease develops via distinct
genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms, a feature common to all of them is transcriptional dysregulation.
PolyQ-expanded proteins interact abnormally with transcriptional factors and disrupt transcription leading to
neurotoxicity. Thus, normalizing transcription is a therapeutic strategy for HD and for polyQ disorders in
general. A novel neuronal nuclear pathway, the sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) pathway, regulates transcription by
modulating transcription factors. In our recent paper, we demonstrated that overexpressed SK2 is toxic to
neurons. We discovered that SK2 is hyperphosphorylated in brain samples from a mouse model of HD, the
BACHD mice, indicating its increased activity. In our preliminary data, we also discovered a potential new
binding partner of SK2 − ZHX2, zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 transcriptional repressor. The ectopic
expression of ZHX2 in primary neurons is also toxic. Remarkably, ZHX2 levels are increased in brain samples
from the BACHD mice. We hypothesize that SK2/ZHX2 is a component of the pathogenic mechanisms in HD
and that inhibiting SK2/ZHX2 signaling will promote survival of HD neurons. In the first aim, we will
characterize the SK2/ZHX2 pathway in primary neurons. In the second aim, we will define the role of
SK2/ZHX2 in HD. We recently demonstrated that an inhibitor of SK2 improves neuronal survival in two rodent
neuron models of HD. Therefore, in the third aim, we will determine if inhibiting or downregulating SK2
alleviates disease phenotypes in HD mice. These studies could form the basis for SK2/ZHX2 pathway–based
drug discovery, with applications to the polyQ disorders."
10876392,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Existing heart disease and stroke prediction models (e.g., Framingham) tend to overestimate risk for
Hispanics/Latinxs (H/L)s. This inaccuracy has significant economic and public health impacts associated with
inaccurate surveillance, intervention targeting, and medical management. Model inaccuracies likely stem from
pervasive underrepresentation of H/Ls in model development and validation efforts. Consequently, traditional
risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be specific to the populations upon whom they were derived,
and not generalizable to H/Ls. In addition, there may be unique disease determinants for H/Ls that remain
untested or unincorporated leading to error in prediction. Importantly, resilience factors such as culturally-
moderated social capital may be critical to understanding risk in this population. Addressing these gaps will
lead to better understanding of CVD risk with corresponding implications for targeted intervention strategies.
This K99/R00 MOSAIC proposal will use secondary data to inform current 10-year CVD risk models using
theory and data-driven methods to increase CVD prediction model accuracy in H/Ls. The proposed training
plan establishes a solid foundation for a career investigating H/L CVD risk and resilience factors. The training
plan leverages substantial resources at The University of Arizona and a mentoring team of senior content
experts. The candidate will gain the following, 1) expertise in H/L CVD disparities, 2) advanced knowledge in
CVD epidemiology, risk, and etiology and pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease, 3) applied machine
learning, cross-validation, and selection of risk prediction models, and 4) cultural factors and social capital
influencing H/L CVD. The research proposal has three aims focused on evaluating and informing existing 10-
year CVD prediction in H/Ls. Using secondary data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
Latinos (HCHS/SOL), the candidate will (Aim 1 – K99) evaluate the prediction accuracy of current 10-year
CVD risk models using a large H/L sample with significant representation of diverse H/Ls (HCHS/SOL). (Aim 2
– R00) the candidate will use available data to identify a group of target risk factors that improve risk prediction
in H/Ls. (Aim 3 – R00) the candidate will test whether adding a social resilience component to CVD risk
models will improve their prediction accuracy for this group. Machine learning will be used to identify valid
predictors of 10-year CVD in Latinos. The social resilience component will capture the multi-dimensionality of
social environments (e.g. spouse, family, neighborhood) using data reduction methods. The proposed research
proposal adopts a holistic view of cardiovascular health to elucidate both risk and resilience factors in this
growing ethnic group."

The objective of the Vision Research Training Program (VRTP) is to provide the next generation of vision
scientists a comprehensive understanding of the basic and clinical science of the nature, prevention and
treatment of diseases of the visual system, while preparing them for careers in academic research. We are
applying for a renewal of the VRTP T32EY027721 training grant to help achieve this objective. The VRTP is an
interdisciplinary training program in the visual sciences that crosses traditional department, school, and
institute boundaries. The VRTP supports interdisciplinary, collaborative and translational research so that
trainees are prepared to enter and compete within emerging, interactive research environments. The inaugural
period of funding of this T32 represented the first vision-related training grant at UW-Madison and helped
overcome a disbursed training structure that was defined by trainees mentored by individual faculty and which
did not provide a broader context and cross collaboration among faculty from multiple disciplines. During the
last funding period, the VRTP provided resources to facilitate mentor-mentee research activities while also
providing a structure that facilitated learning opportunities from a wide range of scientific disciplines as well as
exposure to, and interactions with, clinician scientists and clinicians to better understand translational
applications of vision research and clinical management of major ocular diseases. If renewed, the VRTP will
continue to provide an exceptional scientific and learning environment for trainees to interact with translational
and basic scientists and clinicians. UW-Madison is an outstanding environment for the training of future vision
scientists. These include a Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (DOVS) with exemplary
prowess in both research and clinical activities; the McPherson Eye Research Institute (MERI); a School of
Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) with renown faculty and physical facilities; an equally renowned Graduate
School with Schools and Colleges containing numerous graduate programs and outstanding research mentors
in the biological, engineering, and computational sciences. The VRTP is a coordinated and collaborative effort
between DOVS and MERI. Eighteen faculty affiliated with DOVS and MERI currently comprise the VRTP. They
are organized according to four areas of research emphasis: (a) Development and Diseases of the Anterior
Segment, (b) Development and Diseases of the Posterior Segment; (c) Ocular Epidemiology and Genetics; (d)
Higher Order Visual Processing. Support is being requested for 3 pre-doctoral trainees and 1 post-doctoral
trainee. Pre-doctoral trainees will be supported by the training grant for 1-2 years and post-doctoral trainees for
1-3 years. Training will consist of didactic and research components. Trainees will benefit from individual
development plans as well as structured career planning and counseling. Significant institutional commitment
to training will help ensure the success of the program, in addition to recruitment and retention plans to
enhance diversity and plans for instruction in the responsible conduct of research."

The Interdisciplinary Training Program in Rehabilitation and Neuromuscular Plasticity (NMPT) at the University
of Florida (UF) was initiated in 2003. The overall goal of the NMPT program is to train leaders who will enable a
sustainable and cutting-edge rehabilitation science infrastructure in the United States. Towards this goal, the
NMPT program recruits PhD students from UF PhD programs from across the biomedical science spectrum.
Trainees include individuals with clinical rehabilitation degrees as well as basic scientists with a demonstrated
interest in applying their work to rehabilitation and advancing human health. Our training program is unique in
that it emphasizes the interaction and joint training of rehabilitation clinicians and basic science Trainees. The
program capitalizes on existing UF strengths including a core of well-established rehabilitation investigators,
outstanding research facilities, strong institutional commitment, and a culture of successful mentorship in
rehabilitation. The NMPT program is a well-defined, closely monitored program with clearly established training
objectives and an effective evaluation process. Upon entering the program, each Trainee prepares an
individualized training plan under the guidance of a Faculty Mentor and Translational Research Co-Advisor. The
individualized plan consists of a structured program with courses, journal clubs and seminars, laboratory
research and multiple scientific dissemination experiences. Our well-defined management structure that includes
a Program Director, Education Coordinator, a Translational Science Advisor, an Internal Steering Committee
and an External Advisory Board. The program draws students from five PhD programs in the biomedical
sciences, and our 30 NMPT faculty all have active research funding, and have appointments in multiple UF
Colleges including Public Health and Health Professions, Medicine, Engineering, and Human Health and
Performance. Our program also partners with UF Centers and Institutes including those devoted to movement
disorders, muscle biology, cognitive aging and memory, and exercise science. Over the last funding cycle (2018-
current), the NMPT program has supported 18 Trainees including physical therapists, speech-language
therapists, and basic science trainees. We are proud that our current cohort of seven Trainees includes five
individuals from underrepresented minority groups. The NMPT program is achieving our goal of training
scientists capable of engaging in translational rehabilitation research and sustaining independently funded
research programs."
10848530,"Project Summary
We present our proposal to acquire a Perkin Elmer IVIS SpectrumCT instrument that will be
installed in the IVIS core facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This new instrument
will replace a 12 year old imaging system that is at the end of its useful life. The replacement of
the old imaging system with the IVIS SpectrumCT instrument is a critical need for the Einstein
NIH funded investigators. IVIS been used effectively to monitor tumor or cellular migration and
to monitor dissemination of a variety of pathogens and is considered state of the art for these
type of studies. Because luciferase or fluorescence activity can be monitored without sacrificing
animals, longitudinal measurements can be made on individual mice over time minimizing the
number of animals required to obtain experimental data. NIH funded research projects at
Einstein that would benefit from this instrument are described in the proposal and include
projects in cancer biology and infectious disease pathogenesis. As noted, we require this
instrument to replace an IVIS imaging system that was acquired in 2010 and is the only IVIS
instrument in the core facility and the only functional IVIS imaging system at Einstein. Due to
the age of the current system several issues have arisen in the imaging camera and power
system indicating it is near the end of its useful duty cycle. In addition, the current software
updates are limited due to the age of the computer system in this instrument. Engineering
support and parts for this system are being increasing difficult to source and the vendor has
indicated that engineering support for this system will be eliminated. The Einstein IVIS core has
sufficient space to house the IVIS SpectrumCT instrument and renovations will not be required
to accommodate and install this instrument. In the last year, the Einstein IVIS Core laboratory
has assisted 40 different investigator laboratory groups with imaging using the IVIS system.
The Einstein IVS Core is also a critical support service for the Einstein Cancer Center and the
ERC-CFAR Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS research."
10859725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mortality remains high (20%) for the 8,000 US children each year that develop pediatric acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). No pharmacologic therapies have been identified that decrease the mortality risk
from ARDS. This is likely due to underlying biologic heterogeneity among patients with ARDS that may result in
some benefiting from a therapy whereas others are harmed, limiting the ability to find effective therapies in
clinical trials of general cohorts. Inflammatory phenotypes have been described in ARDS that may help identify
underlying biologic differences contributing to heterogeneity in treatment effect. However, these phenotypes
cannot currently be identified in real-time. There is an urgent need for easily available markers to identify
clinically relevant heterogeneity in patients with ARDS. Markers of dead space may be promising for this
purpose. Dead space is area of the lung that receive ventilation without perfusion and reflects abnormal
pulmonary perfusion (microvascular dysfunction, low cardiac output) and alveolar overdistension. With routine
patient monitoring data (time-based capnography, blood gases), dead space can be estimated with the end
tidal alveolar dead space fraction (AVDSf). We have found in single-center studies that AVDSf is more strongly
associated with mortality risk than are markers of the severity of hypoxemia (oxygenation index [OI]) in early
pediatric ARDS. Dead space may also be an attractive marker for identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect
for therapies such as inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) that target pulmonary perfusion. iNO is a selective pulmonary
vasodilator, with additional anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation effects, that is commonly used off-label for
refractory hypoxemia in ARDS. But almost all clinical trials of iNO therapy have failed to demonstrate a benefit
when enrolling general cohorts of patients or selecting patients based on severity of hypoxemia. One small
pediatric trial found higher extracorporeal membrane oxygenation free survival suggesting the potential for
some subgroups to benefit from iNO therapy. Our preliminary data suggest that iNO therapy decreases the
AVDSf associated mortality risk and that a decline in AVDSf with iNO therapy is associated with improving
plasma markers of microvascular dysfunction. Our central hypotheses are that the routinely available AVDSf is
more strongly tied to mortality risk than OI and that AVDSf is an important marker of heterogeneity in the iNO
treatment effect in patients with ARDS. These hypotheses will be tested through the following Specific Aims:
1) validate AVDSf for risk stratification of mortality in pediatric ARDS 2) determine if there is heterogeneity in
treatment effect for iNO defined by AVDSf, and 3) detect the association between AVDSf and microvascular
dysfunction trajectory and whether iNO therapy modifies the association. Demonstrating that AVDSf
outperforms OI for mortality risk stratification in patients with ARDS and that AVDSf may identify the patients
most likely to benefit from iNO therapy, has the potential to be frameshifting for future clinical trials of ARDS
interventions, including those of iNO therapy."
10831032,"Project Summary
The central job of the taste system involves deciding whether a substance in the mouth should be swallowed or
rejected. This job is of unique importance, in that these decisions are necessarily made after a potentially toxic
stimulus is already internal. Primary gustatory cortex (GC) has proven vital for driving taste rejection behavior in
situ, but it is unlikely GC is acting alone to accomplish this task. Of particular interest as a possible functional
partner to GC is the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which has long been known to be centrally involved in feeding
behavior, and which contains neurons producing two distinct types of palatability-related taste responses. This
proposal describes work that will use multi-electrode electrophysiology, electromyography, pathway- and
neuron-specific optogenetics, and complex neural and behavioral analyses to investigate whether and how GC
and LH coordinate to drive consumption-related cortical firing and behavior. Dual-site electrophysiological
responses from awake, tasting rats will be analyzed to determine whether and how LH and GC responses are
coupled for production of palatability-related firing; further work will determine whether particular response types
or neurons (i.e., orexin+ neurons, known to drive consumption) contribute to any observed LH-GC coupling.
Perturbing LHGC input (and specifically the activity of orexin+ neurons) during tasting sessions will test whether
and how hypothalamic input impacts GC taste response dynamics. These experiments will be the first exploration
into GC-LH cooperation for taste processing and behavioral output. Over the course of this project, advanced
computational training will be acquired both in the classroom and through the development of novel scripts for
specific analyses. The collaborative and intimate environment within the lab and at Brandeis will nourish not only
the knowledgebase (computational and beyond), but the mentorship, communication, and technical skills
required to develop as an independent researcher. The combination of behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic
approaches will provide invaluable insight to the taste system, ultimately improving our knowledge of the
gustatory system and how taste processing and decisions are made. As we are directly investigating palatability
and its relationship to behavior this clears the path for future research on disorders related to consumption and
hedonics. As such, the work is related to improving human health in this era of obesity and binge-eating."
10831037,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastasis is responsible for more than 90% of cancer patient mortality yet there are no therapies that specifically
target metastatic disease. Many of the current in vitro models of metastasis focus on the molecular mechanisms
of migration, invasion and/or surviving anoikis, but cannot recapitulate the complexity of the environment in which
metastasis occurs in vivo. Conversely, in mouse models of metastasis, it has been difficult to examine the
molecular mechanisms that enable cells to proceed through each distinct step of metastasis due to limited
material that can be isolated and infrequency of metastatic events in these models. For these reasons little is
known about the challenges facing metastasizing cells in vivo, and how they are overcome. We have previously
established a clinically relevant model of melanoma metastasis, using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in
immunocompromised mice, that recapitulates the outcome of the disease of the patient in mice, to dissect the
metastatic cascade into distinct steps. Using this model, we have shown that metastasizing melanoma cells
undergo reversible metabolic adaptations to withstand oxidative stress in part through an increased dependence
on NADPH-generating enzymes in the one-carbon pathway. Our preliminary data also show an increase in
NADP+ levels in metastatic nodules compared to subcutaneous tumors, suggesting an increase in de novo
NADP+ synthesis. NADP+ is generated from NAD+ by NAD+ kinase (NADK). We observe higher levels of NADK
in metastatic nodules compared to subcutaneous tumors, where metastatic nodules express the isoform of
NADK with the highest activity, while subcutaneous tumors do not. We will test the hypothesis that metastasizing
melanoma cells upregulate a specific isoform of NADK to increase NADP+ production, increase oxidative stress
resistance and survival at different steps of the metastatic cascade.
Using both melanoma cell lines and PDX tumor cells, Aim 1 will determine the role of different NADK isoforms
in oxidative stress resistance, Aim 2 will define the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of NADK isoforms,
and Aim 3 will establish the role of different NADK isoforms as metastatic drivers in vivo. In addition, Aim 3 will
test how perturbation of oxidative stress in different organelles impacts metastasis. Together this work will
significantly contribute to our understanding of a novel mechanism of metabolic plasticity through upregulation
of a specific NADK isoform and identify organelle-specific metabolic pathways as novel therapeutically targetable
vulnerabilities in melanoma metastasis."
10862503,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - RP2 (Vaccine and Antibodies Against Henipaviruses)
Pathogenic RNA viruses represent continuous infectious disease and pandemic threats to public health. Among
these are the two emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses: the ‘prototype’ henipaviruses (HNVs); Nipah virus (NiV)
and Hendra virus (HeV), discovered in the mid to late 1990s. The prototype HNVs have a uniquely broad tropism
capable of infecting 18 species across 6 orders of mammals using the conserved ephrin-B2 and -B3 ligands as
entry receptors. NiV and HeV infection often results in a systemic and fatal respiratory and/or neurological
disease in multiple mammalian species including humans. NiV and henipaviral disease are also included in the
WHO List of Priority Pathogens, and they are significant biothreats to humans and livestock in South and South
East Asia and Australia. HNVs have two membrane glycoproteins: the attachment glycoprotein (G) and the
fusion glycoprotein (F) that are the major targets of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of all vaccine and
antiviral monoclonal antibody (mAb) strategies. The most extensively studied HNV vaccine is a soluble
recombinant form of HeV G (HeV-sG), shown to provide complete protection against lethal challenge by either
NiV (both Malaysia (NiV-M) and Bangladesh (NiV-B) or HeV in 4 species including nonhuman primates (NHPs)).
With no licensed vaccines or treatments available for human use, this project will use the prototype HNVs as a
model to develop, test, and translate a novel vaccination platform (a thermostable, needle-free, adaptable, and
widely deployable polyphosphazene (PPZ) adjuvanted dissolvable microneedle patch (MNP)). Preliminary data
demonstrates potent immunogenicity of a PPZ-MNP-HeV-sG vaccine in mice, inducing robust antigen-specific
HNV cross-neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses. The MNP vaccines will be used to evaluate
HeV-sG and compare stabilized soluble forms of HNV G and F (sGtet and sFstb) and combinations in challenge
studies. A reverse genetics system has been developed to generate recombinant, nonpathogenic Cedar virus
(rCedV) and rCedV chimeric virus tools by swapping the G and F glycoproteins with those of NiV/HeV as a rapid,
surrogate, BSL-2 high-throughput neutralization platform to be used to rapidly evaluate HNV vaccine responses.
Also, divergent and pathogenic zoonotic HNVs have been discovered including the related rodent borne Mòjiāng
virus and Langya virus (LayV)), and the divergent bat-borne Angavokely virus (AngV). This project will develop
and test the rapid, adaptable and readily deployable MNP vaccine platform together with new virological tools to
facilitate the translational nature of this pandemic preparedness approach. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop PPZ-
MNP-based sGtet and sFstb prototype HNV vaccines; 2) Construct new reporter virus tools; 3) Evaluate vaccine-
induced immune responses and HNV-specific mAbs and nabs; and 4) Validate the PPZ-MNP platform with
another paramyxovirus antigen."
10862504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RP3 (Cedar Henipavirus Animal Model)
Henipaviruses are single-stranded, negative-sense enveloped RNA viruses of the paramyxovirus family.
Two henipaviruses, Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), cause a systemic and often fatal respiratory
and/or encephalitic disease in humans and ten other mammalian species. Importantly, NiV and HeV are
significant biothreats to humans and economically important livestock in Australia and Southeast Asia.
There are currently no vaccines or therapeutics approved for human use. Notably, development of
countermeasures for NiV and HeV is hampered by the fact that these viruses require BSL-4 containment,
meaning that very few research groups worldwide have access to the required biocontainment facilities to
perform preclinical studies with these important human viral pathogens. To address this problem, we are
developing a BSL-2 animal model that is based on Cedar virus (CedV), which is a non-pathogenic
henipavirus. Specifically, we are employing recombinant Cedar viruses (rCedVs) in which the NiV and HeV
fusion (F) and receptor-binding glycoprotein (G) are expressed in the rCedV genome, replacing CedV F and
G. Additionally, we have also incorporated our recently developed in vivo bioluminescence methodology to
longitudinally trace the dynamics and anatomical progression of rCedV-luciferase (rCedV-luc) infections in
individual animals. Using various approaches to inhibit the host innate immune response in mice, we have
demonstrated sustained replication of rCedV-luc and the rCedV-NiV-luc and rCedV-HeV-luc chimeras.
Importantly, whereas rCedV-luc does not establish stable expression in the brain, both of the chimeric
viruses do. Moreover, preliminary findings show that rCedV-NiV- luc causes neurological dysfunction and
death in specific strains of mice. The rCedV-luc platform is thus an authentic henipavirus system that can
be used to study henipavirus in vivo biology safely and expediently under BSL-2 containment. Our overall
hypothesis is that rCedV-luc infection of mice lacking specific innate immune responses represents a BSL-2
platform for the study of henipavirus biology and pathogenesis, as well as for development and testing of
anti-viral countermeasures. We will address this hypothesis through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To optimize
the use of immunodeficient mice and rCedV-NiV-luc/rCedV-HeV-luc chimeras as a robust BSL2 model of
pathogenic henipavirus disease; Aim 2: To determine the mechanism of rCedV-NiV neurovirulence; Aim 3:
To define the efficacy and mechanisms of mAb-based therapeutics for CNS-resident henipavirus infections.
Aims involve synergistic collaborations with several other research projects and cores in this U19 program.
Successful completion of these Aims will establish the rCedV-luc mouse model as a robust BSL-2 platform
for the exploration of henipavirus pathogenesis and countermeasures."
10862505,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RP4 (Monoclonal Antibodies against Henipaviruses, Arenaviruses
and Nairoviruses)
The paramyxoviruses, nairoviruses, and arenaviruses represent collections of diverse virus species, and these
groups of viruses are ideal for prototype pathogen immunity approaches. The goal of developing medical
countermeasures is to confer protective immunity, which can be provided by active immunization (as in RP1 and
RP2 here) or by passive immunization with long-acting (90-day half-life) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this
RP4, we will used several different state-of-the-art antibody discovery approaches to isolate and engineer
optimal mAbs for these 3 major groups of viruses. Virus-immune B cells will be interrogated with several well-
developed human mAb discovery platforms, including high-throughput single cell sorting and single cell RNAseq
techniques, or converted to stable human hybridoma cell lines. B cell line supernatants or recombinant mAbs
will be subjected to high-throughput screening to identify Abs that bind to virus surface proteins and functionally
inhibit virus replication. Our objectives include determining the principles governing optimal mAb combinations
and synergy, developing new in vitro selection methods to enhance antibody neutralization potency and breadth,
and genetically modifying mAbs for extended-half-life properties to enable the use of injections of long-lived
antibodies to confer protective immunity and protection like that of vaccines. Lessons learned in the year 1 to 3
studies of the prototype pathogens Lassa, Machupo, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Hendra, and Nipah
viruses will be applied to new discovery campaigns for related viruses in the same family or genera, as a model
for applying “plug and play” Test Cases for the prototype pathogen approach. Identifying antibodies to the related
pathogens, will validate the prototype pathogens approach, preparing us for an unexpected epidemic of a
previously unknown paramyxovirus, nairovirus, or arenavirus. Also, these programs will isolate promising
medical countermeasures for additional potential causes of future epidemics. Further, incorporating screens for
wide breadth of recognition in these studies may enable identification of pan-family or pan-genus antibodies that
can but used for multiple related agents, including future related pathogens for which we have not yet specifically
prepared. Identifying major sites of vulnerability on the virus surface proteins for recognition by neutralizing
and/or protective antibodies also will be useful for our consortium partners working on antigen design. Prioritized
mAbs then will be tested for therapeutic efficacy in multiple animal models of infection including nonhuman
primates. The leads will be selected, and CHO cell lines will be made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical for Ab
production, in preparation for cGMP manufacture and IND planning. The work promises to yield best-in-class
mAb combinations for broad and potent activity against three groups of viruses that can be used to treat or
prevent human virus infections. These studies will identify protective/neutralizing epitopes of mAbs through
structural studies of antigen-Ab complexes that inform immunogen design in RP1/RP2 using rational vaccine
antigen design approaches."

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the pressing need for rapid drug development and novel antiviral
therapies. Nanobodies, derived from camelid animals, show promise as small antigen-binding entities capable
of recognizing inaccessible epitopes. Their ability to penetrate tissues and cross the blood-brain barrier makes
them well-suited for treating viral infections that affect the Central Nervous System (CNS). This project focuses
on addressing Henipaviruses (HNV) and arenaviruses (ARV), which pose significant global health risks but
lack specific treatments. HNVs can cause severe respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) illnesses with
high mortality rates. On the other hand, ARV infections are responsible for fatal hemorrhagic fever. Specifically,
the study targets Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) as prototypes for HNV, as well as Lassa virus
(LASV) and Machupo virus (MACV) for ARV. The research aims to develop nanobody-based therapeutic
approaches by targeting the viral entry machinery, such as the glycoproteins G and F for HNV and the
glycoprotein complex (GPC) for ARV. The project utilizes three nanobody development platforms, including
camelid animals, nanomice and human nanobody libraries, to efficiently identify potential nanobody leads. By
employing a structure-based approach, the project aims to understand viral neutralization mechanisms,
improve nanobody engineering techniques, and design nanobodies capable of effectively penetrating the
blood-brain barrier. The specific objectives involve identifying cross-reactive nanobodies for HNVs, developing
nanobodies to overcome the glycan shield of ARVs, conducting structural characterization, enhancing
nanobody efficacy and CNS bioavailability, and expanding the research to include other viral targets within the
HNV and ARV groups in the second phase. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute to the development of
effective nanobody-based therapies for HNV and ARV infections, while establishing a generalizable strategy
for future emerging viruses with similar characteristics, thereby mitigating the global public health risks
associated with these pathogens."

The University at Buffalo (UB), SUNY Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Training Program prepares MS
degree graduates who go on to affect OSH practice in New York State and the surrounding region. Specific
objectives of the program include: 1) to provide a high-quality, comprehensive OSH education to our graduates,
and 2) to prepare graduates for the challenges faced by safety professionals through practical field experience
and professional development activities. MS level students from Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE)
complete coursework on a breadth of OSH topics, including safety, industrial hygiene, toxicology, ergonomics,
and human-centered design, along with complementary courses in statistics, research methods, and engineering
management. Trainees also complete OSHA certification training to develop an understanding of regulatory
requirements. Specialization and practical experience is received through an internship and mentored capstone
field project experience, which prepares graduates to enter the OSH workforce. Throughout the program,
trainees participate in professional development activities and engage with safety professionals at local and
regional meetings. The program benefits from a strong collaboration between the ISE Department, the
Toxicology Research Center, and the Atlantic OSHA Training Center. Faculty members from each of these
groups work closely with the trainees in the courses, during the internship, and while advising their capstone
project. Since its inception in 2007, the program has been successful in producing safety professionals who have
continued on to careers with government agencies (including OSHA and NIOSH), industry, and academia. With
the current application, we propose to continue this success for a 4th cycle. Specific strengths of the UB program
include: the training of engineers in hazard recognition, injury prevention, and industrial hygiene, supporting
prevention through design initiatives; program faculty with a breadth of experience to mentor industrial and
applied research experiences in a variety of OSH areas; a strong connection with local industry to provide
internship and capstone projects; and the complement of coursework training, OSHA training, and field
experience to provide the background necessary to address today’s current OSH challenges. Improvement of
the program is supported by program evaluation. Program effectiveness is evaluated by course surveys and
grades, trainee exit surveys and interviews, and career placement and tracking of graduates. In addition,
feedback is solicited from an advisory committee of OSH professionals to ensure the program continues to
address employer needs. During the proposed project period, we aim to increase the enrollment of a diverse
group of trainees and have aligned our recruitment and retention efforts with the School of Engineering’s Diversity
Plan. Funding will allow for up to 6 trainees at the pre-doctoral (MS) level to be supported each year. The support
from NIOSH will enable the UB OSH Training Project to continue to have a positive influence on OSH practice
in New York and on the profession throughout the country."

Industrial hygienists and other occupational safety and health (OSH) play a critical role in addressing
occupational health hazards. However, there is an unmet need for highly trained OSH professionals; this need
is even greater for industrial hygienists. Meanwhile, worker health is a substantial issue within Indiana, where
workplace related injury and fatality rates are consistently higher than the national average. The Purdue
University Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences (OEHS) program will address this need through
training the next generation of industrial hygienists. This program includes PhD, MS, and BS degrees in OEHS;
the BS and MS programs are ABET accredited in industrial hygiene. Since 2017, program faculty and students
have received >$100 million in external funding, published more >35 peer reviewed journal articles, given >70
research presentations, and received >30 honors or awards in recognition of their research, teaching, and
service. Faculty are noted for their excellence in both research and teaching within the areas of industrial
hygiene, occupational safety and health, environmental health, exposure science, occupational toxicology,
radiation health and safety, and occupational epidemiology. Required coursework for our programs includes
safety and ethics, exposure assessment, physical agents, industrial hygiene measurements and instrumentation,
safety engineering, ergonomics, ventilation, toxicology, epidemiology, environmental health, risk assessment
and statistics. The core curriculum utilizes student activities that emphasize critical thinking, communications,
teamwork, creativity and awareness of current issues. Recently developed courses additionally incorporate
service-based or case-study based learning approaches. Program trainees have multiple opportunities to interact
with industrial hygiene and OSH professionals at a networking events held in West Lafayette, Indianapolis,
Chicago, and beyond. Faculty and students conduct award-winning research related to occupational exposure
and impacts of manganese and other metals; industrial contamination leading to environmental disparities;
characterization and risk assessment of aerosols; and radiation health and safety. The OEHS program, as well
as Purdue University, value diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and seeks to incorporate these principles
throughout every aspect of the program. These efforts will be reflected in broadening recruitment efforts to reach
faculty and trainees with a variety of backgrounds and experience; promotion of professional development
programs and resources to enable every trainee to reach their full potential; and recognition that application of
DEI values to the practice of industrial hygiene will be essential in order to address the hazards faced by an
increasingly diverse workforce. The success of Purdue’s OEHS program is evidenced by the fact that program
graduates have taken leadership roles in industrial hygiene and related fields. By combining past experience
and adapting to future needs, the Purdue OEHS program will continue to train tomorrow’s leaders in the field of
industrial hygiene and occupational health."

Resection of the liver (i.e., partial hepatectomy; PHx) is a common surgical procedure used to treat multiple
forms of liver disease, including removal of tumors caused by liver cancer and metastases. The liver can
regenerate to restore normal hepatic function, ensuring a complication-free recovery in most patients.
However, a significant number of patients suffer from failed liver regeneration leading to serious complications,
including post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), a condition where the liver remnant cannot sustain critical
hepatic functions. Biomarkers of the development of PHLF after liver resection are not universally predictive.
More importantly, there are no targeted therapies available to stimulate liver regeneration. This proposal seeks
to discover innovative strategies to better predict PHLF and simultaneously uncover novel putative therapeutic
targets to promote liver regeneration in patients undergoing PHx. Our strong preliminary results, generated
using experimental PHx in mice and intraoperative liver and plasma samples from liver resection patients from
a well-defined repository, suggest that rapid activation of intrahepatic blood coagulation is a central
determinant of liver regeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that cross-linked fibrin polymers, formed in the
remnant liver as a result of increased coagulation activity, promote hepatic platelet accumulation that
stimulates liver regeneration. Our approach includes innovative analysis of the interplay between fibrinogen
and platelets in immediately available human liver and plasma samples, previously collected in precise
sequence during surgical liver resection, comprehensive mechanistic assessment of fibrin(ogen) structure and
hemostatic functions in experimental and clinical liver resection samples, genetically-modified mice expressing
fibrin(ogen) proteins with specific functional mutations, comprehensive analyses linking failed regeneration to
hepatic dysfunction, and application of FDA-approved fibrinogen concentrates as a novel pro-regenerative
therapeutic. The investigative team comprises internationally-recognized researchers and physician-scientists
at the nexus of coagulation in liver disease. The combined expertise of the investigative team in mechanistic
studies of liver injury and regeneration, coagulation and fibrin(ogen) biochemistry/function, and leading-edge
clinical/translational investigation maximizes impact of the proposed studies. In our proposed studies we will:
(Aim 1) Determine the mechanism linking blood coagulation to liver regeneration after PHx; (Aim 2) Identify
modifications of fibrinogen hemostatic function connected to outcome in patients after liver resection; and (Aim
3) Determine the potential of fibrinogen supplementation as a novel pro-regenerative therapy in experimental
PHx. The expected outcome of these Specific Aims is the discovery of a novel mechanistic link between
coagulation and liver regeneration. The proposed studies are potentially transformative, because they would
suggest that changes in blood coagulation, largely considered secondary to the surgery, can be measured and
therapeutically controlled to drive patient recovery and prevent liver failure."

The objective of this proposal is to investigate how temporal lobe (TL) seizures with different onset patterns
propagate through the basal ganglia (BG) and to evaluate the implication of this circuit in the control of TL
seizures. TL epilepsy is the most common form of focal epilepsy and a third of the patients do not respond to
drug therapy.
Resective surgery and deep brain stimulation can be effective, however, only some patients are
eligible and very few become seizure free.
There is then a clear need for better and more individualized epilepsy
treatments based on a rigorous understanding of the networks and brain structures implicated in TL seizures.
Studies on TL seizures have mainly focused on the interconnected structures of the limbic circuit, but there is
also strong evidence suggesting that the BG could be a key contributor to the propagation and control of TL
seizures. Several studies using neuropharmacological inhibition, electrophysiological recordings, metabolic
alterations, and advanced imaging have suggested an inhibitory role of the BG in TL epilepsy. However, findings
have been inconsistent, and the exact mechanisms and BG pathways implicated in TL seizures are still under
debate. These heterogeneous results may be explained by seizure onset patterns. Recent studies focusing on
the seizure pattern have proposed that the ictal activity originating from the same ictogenic area might propagate
through different pathways depending on the seizure pattern, which could potentially explain the heterogeneity
of previous findings. To better understand the implication of the BG and its dopaminergic system, we propose to
use a non-human primate model, as it captures characteristics of the BG specific to primates, including humans.
Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that seizures with a low amplitude, fast activity pattern will propagate
primarily through the putamen-substantia nigra (Put-SNr) pathway, while seizures with a high amplitude, slow
oscillation onset pattern are more likely to involve the nucleus accumbens-pallidum (NAcc-GPi) pathway. To
further investigate the role of these pathways, we propose to investigate how TL seizures with different onset
patterns propagate through the basal ganglia as well as the implication of these circuits in the control of TL
seizures. In Aim 1, we will record the unit and local field potential activity of the NAcc-GPi and the Put-SNr
pathway during TL seizures induced with intracerebral injection of penicillin. Based on the recordings performed
in Aim 1, we will identify the area of the NAcc and Put that is most affected by TL seizures. In Aim 2, we will
target these areas to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic modulation on TL seizures. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
simultaneously record the activity of the SNr and GPi during TL seizures, identify the area with the strongest
response, and evaluate the effect of pharmacological inhibition of the BG output structures on TL seizure
frequency and duration. This work will characterize the extent to which BG neurons and the dopaminergic system
are involved in TL seizures, which would provide key data for novel therapy development."

Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma that leads to irreversible vision
loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to dysfunction of trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue is a hallmark of
POAG. However, the pathological mechanisms leading to TM dysfunction and IOP elevation are poorly
understood. Our recent studies have shown that chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with
the pathophysiology of glaucomatous TM damage and IOP elevation. However, the exact mechanisms of TM
cell dysfunction/loss are not completely understood. The ER and mitochondria communicate constantly via
mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) to regulate vital cellular functions including autophagy.
Autophagy degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles including mitochondria (known as mitophagy)
via lysosomes. Impaired mitophagy is known to cause abnormal accumulation of damaged mitochondria
resulting into cell death. In our preliminary studies, primary human TM cells exhibited an abundant mitochondria
and MAMs. Interestingly, human primary TM cells and TM tissues from POAG donor eyes demonstrated
increased accumulation of mitochondria. Moreover, chronic ER stress-induced transcriptional factors, ATF4 and
CHOP led to increased reactive oxygen species and impaired mitophagy in primary human TM cells. Our overall
goals are to define the role of MAMs and impaired mitophagy in TM dysfunction and IOP elevation in POAG and
to further target these pathways for the treatment of glaucoma. We hypothesize that chronic ER stress induces
impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to TM dysfunction/loss and IOP elevation in POAG.
We will determine whether impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with TM
dysfunction and IOP elevation in human and mouse glaucoma (Aim 1). We will further determine whether chronic
ER stress induces impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to TM dysfunction/loss and IOP
elevation (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform proof-of-principle studies exploring whether the mitophagy enhancers
improve outflow facility and reduce elevated IOP in mouse models of glaucoma (Aim 3). We will utilize human
primary TM cells and post-mortem TM tissues from normal and glaucoma donor eyes, mouse models of
glaucoma and mitophagy flux reporter mouse model (mito-qc) as well as transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and the Seahorse assays to determine the role of MAMs, mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in TM
function and IOP homeostasis. The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide novel crosstalk
between ER stress and mitophagy and target the pathological mechanisms for the treatment of general POAG."

With the dramatic increase in obesity and diabetes, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases
(NAFLD) is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. NAFLD is a significant risk factor for insulin
resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases. We need to understand the underlying
molecular mechanisms adequately to manage NAFLD and T2DM clinically. CARF is a novel p53 pathway
protein that interacts with p53 and regulate its functions. Previous studies reported that an inverse
relationship exists between CARF and p53. We posit that p53-CARF interplay plays a vital role in the
outcome of p53 actions responding to various stressors. Our recent publication showed that free fatty acid
(FFA)-induced stress suppressed hepatic CARF that triggered fat deposition in the liver, while exogenous
delivery of CARF prevented it. Further, we found that silencing of CARF perturbed insulin signaling
pathway in hepatocytes. Most intriguingly, expression of PCK1, a key hepatic gluconeogenic gene, was
increased after silencing of CARF in hepatocytes. This led us to propose that CARF is a transcriptional
regulator of PCK1 and, hence hepatic glucose output and IR. Growing evidence suggests that metabolic
stress-induced p53 could alter the cell's metabolic homeostasis leading to the development of NAFLD and
IR in both humans and rodents. Notably, our preliminary data further showed that CARF expression was
decreased in HFD-fed livers with increased p53, thus establishing an inverse relationship. However, the
role of this inverse relationship in metabolic stress and its outcome are unknown. We hypothesize that
CARF could be a downstream target of p53 in metabolic stress. Its inhibition drives the development of IR
and NAFLD. Using in vitro cellular and in vivo mouse models of NAFLD and IR integrated with the ChIP-
sequencing, CUT and RUN sequencing, Co-IP, ITT, GTT, and PTT assays, this study will uncover a novel
function of CARF -p53 interplay in the development of NAFLD and IR. Understanding this mechanism
could reduce a considerable health burden in the USA and worldwide. This SuRE grant will create an
opportunity for mentoring underserved undergraduate and graduate students to complete their research
thesis at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. Recent data show that the student population
at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science is 35% Black and 25% Hispanic. By integrating
student training with the proposed research plan, this grant will help students to acquire considerable
technical skills and the expertise necessary to perform high-quality, basic, and translational biomedical
research."

Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States, resulting in $4.2
billion in direct health system costs annually. Due to underlying immunosuppression and the lack of effective
antiviral therapeutics, transplant patients may develop serious sequelae from HuNoV infections. Though
bacterial gut microbiota has been shown to enhance replication and pathogenesis of enteric viruses in preclinical
models, its role in HuNoV infection remains largely unknown. In this project, we aim to gain greater mechanistic
insights into how gut microbiota modulate HuNoV infection in transplant patients. Our central hypothesis is that
transplant patients with symptomatic HuNoV infection will have a gut microbiome signature showing an
enrichment of specific gut microbiota (Enterobacteriaceae) that facilitate infection of HIEs, and those who
develop chronic symptoms from HuNoV infection will have a concomitant depletion of specific gut microbiota
that modulate host innate immune responses (type 1 interferons). In Aim 1, we will further define both gut
microbiome and host factor differences in transplant patients ±HuNoV infections. First, we will establish a larger
cohort of adult and pediatric transplant patients and collect longitudinal stool specimens. Then, we will perform
comprehensive gut microbiome profiling (metagenomic shotgun sequencing and bacterial qPCR) to confirm our
preliminary results. We predict that HuNoV-infected transplant patients will have significantly different gut
microbiota signatures compared to uninfected counterparts, and that higher intensity of immunosuppression and
high antibiotic load will correspond with chronic diarrhea in HuNoV-infected transplant patients. In Aim 2, we will
determine if Enterobacteriaceae facilitate HuNoV infection using an in vitro HIE model. First, we will infect jejunal
HIEs with HuNoV and co-incubate HuNoV with various Enterobacteriaceae spp. Then, we will perform RNA
extractions and quantitative HuNoV RT-qPCR to evaluate the effect of co-incubating various Enterobacteriaceae
spp. on viral replication. We predict that Enterobacteriaceae promotes HuNoV infection of HIEs. If this is the
case, we will investigate if this is a phenomenon observed only in HBGA-expressing members of
Enterobacteriaceae. In Aim 3, we will determine if transplant patients with chronic symptomatic HuNoV infections
have different systemic cytokine signatures compared to uninfected counterparts. We will perform bulk cytokine
analysis on serum samples utilizing Isoplexis, a novel functional proteomic profiling platform. We predict that
transplant patients with chronic diarrhea from HuNoV infection will exhibit a paucity of genus Bacteroides,
resulting in depletion of type 1 interferons, which then leads to a decreased Th1 immune response, increased
Th2 immune response and increased expression of Th2-predominant cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10). The proposed
experiments, training and didactic coursework in this K23 will equip the candidate (Dr. Chong) with unique
skillsets that will enable her transition to independence as a physician scientist in gut microbiota-HuNoV
interactions in transplant patients."
10859485,"In this project, we aim to translate a fluorine-19 (19F) MRI technology to visualize the tumor associated
macrophage (TAM) burden in patients with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
HNSCC is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. TAMs often comprise a significant volume fraction of tumor
mass, and a high TAM burden in the tumor microenvironment is associated with poor therapeutic prognosis. In
HNSCC patients developing locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease, anti-PD-1 antibody checkpoint
inhibitor therapy is currently the standard of care, however, the response rates remain poor (~20%). TAMs have
been associated with immunosuppression and T-cell exclusion, which are associated with a low response rate
to checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, there is an urgent need for biomarker probes that can non-invasively monitor
TAMs in clinical trials to help stratify patients and rationally optimize therapeutic strategies. Towards this goal,
we propose translating a fast-clearing perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsion as a 19F MRI tracer to assay TAMs
in vivo. Following intravenous injection, the size and morphology of nonbiologic PFC nanoemulsion droplets
make them susceptible to endocytosis by phagocytic immune cells, particularly macrophages. The in situ labeled
cells accumulate at inflammatory lesions, and the resulting 19F MRI hot-spots can be quantified, where the signal
is linearly proportional to the macrophage burden. In situ PFC macrophage labeling has been used in a multitude
of preclinical inflammation models, including in the context of TAMs. However, no injectable, clinical PFC
nanoemulsion imaging agent product exists despite the proven specificity and safety of these compositions.
Building on this work, the proposal has three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Perfluorocarbon NE formulation. This aim will
identify a lead formulation and collaborate with a contract manufacturing organization to produce a novel
nanoemulsion composition (“TAM-Sense”) at liter scale suitable for a Phase 1 trial. Aim 2. Safety,
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and genotoxicity studies. We will perform in vivo GLP studies of TAM-Sense
in two animal species to evaluate pharmacotoxicology and clearance profiles following intravenous injection, as
well as in vitro genotoxicity assays. Aim 3. Clinical studies. We will conduct a pilot clinical trial (N=12 total) to
image TAMs in recurrent HNSCC patients at UC San Diego prior to treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The
endpoints will include (i) safety and (ii) assessment of apparent ‘TAM burden’ biomarker (i.e., F-atoms/tumor
volume) via 19F MRI hot-spot quantitation at tumor mass. We will explore the predictive strength of the 19F MRI
findings versus PD-L1 and CD68 (macrophage) immunostaining of biopsies in the same patients. Moreover, we
will perform exploratory analyses correlating TAM burden to clinical outcomes, including 6-month progression-
free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). This pilot study will generate important safety and proof-
of-concept biomarker data needed to support and adequately power a more definitive future trial."

This proposal seeks to elucidate the mechanisms of β-cell senescence, an aging hallmark, as a contributor to
type 2 diabetes (T2D) and identify optimal therapeutic targets. Pancreatic insulin secreting β-cells, crucial to
glucose homeostasis, are heavily secretory cells, equipped to respond to small changes in blood glucose
levels and highly susceptible to stress by nutrient overload. My work has identified that mouse and human β-
cells undergo senescence in response to insulin resistance (IR), leading to loss of cellular identity, impaired
function and secretion of a unique senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Additionally, I showed
that senolysis improved blood glucose levels and recovery of β-cell function and identity. I hypothesize that
cellular senescence and its SASP are targetable drivers of β-cell dysfunction and loss. My goals are to
understand the mechanisms behind β-cell senescence and identify the optimal therapeutic strategy. Aim 1.
Identify the cell autonomous driver(s) of β-cell senescence and its functional effects. Based on our
models of IR and DNA damage, we hypothesize that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 is upregulated
early in β-cell senescence and is followed by p16Ink4a. Genetic gain- and loss-of-function strategies will be used
to compare the effects of p21Cpi1 and p16Ink4a on mouse and human β-cell function, identity and SASP.
Additionally, the functional changes of senescent cells will be pinpointed. This aim will define the cell
autonomous molecular mechanism(s) that drive β-cell senescence and its functional consequences. Aim 2.
Elucidate the non-cell autonomous effects of the β-cell SASP. The hypothesis is that β-cell senescence
can be driven by a non-cell autonomous mechanism through SASP factors, capable of impairing the function
and gene identity of neighboring cells and precipitating their entry into senescence. To evaluate the effects of
SASP upon neighboring β-cells, we will test the effects of the overall and specific selected factors on insulin
secretion, senescence status and gene expression. Additionally, we will test the temporo-spatial effects of
SASP on neighboring cells using our p21Cip1-dTomato Red MIP:GFP reporter mice. This aim will test the
effects of β-cell SASP on non-senescent cells. Aim 3. Compare the effects of senolytic and senomorphic
drugs in the recovery of β-cell function and identity. In our previous studies, senolysis effectively restored
β-cell function and identity but a decrease in the number of senescent cells (senolysis) may be detrimental to
an already inadequate beta cell mass, so perhaps only inhibiting their SASP (senomorphic effect) would
render similar beneficial results. The hypothesis is that senormorphic drugs will restore β-cell function and
identity without impacting cell mass. This aim will compare the effects of senolytic and senomorphic drugs on
islets of human donors that have one or more of the following characteristics impairing glucose metabolism:
older age, IR and T2D. This aim seeks to identify the optimal pharmacological mechanisms to recover the
function and cellular identity without mass impairment."

Acute respiratory viral infections represent an enormous societal and economic burden with the potential for
persistent declines in lung function among recovering patients. Severe infections trigger abnormal repair
processes and inflammation leading to remodeling of small airways and alveoli, impaired pulmonary function
and death in particularly susceptible individuals. These features of lung injury, repair and remodeling of small
airways and alveoli, are recapitulated in mouse models of H1N1 influenza (PR8) virus infection, wherein alveolar
injury leads to expansion of basal cells (BC) in airways and replacement of damaged alveolar epithelium. In
preliminary studies we provide evidence that nascent BC are derived from a serous-like subset of airway
secretory cells (intralobar serous or IS). We have identified an unexpected role for TAp63 in the specification of
nascent BC and that Lcn2 expression by “activated” AT2 cells of the PR8-infected lung contributes to BC
recruitment to injured alveoli. Finally, we show that recruitment of nascent BC to damaged alveolar regions
impacts the proliferative activity and clonal behavior of surviving alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Aims of this proposal
seek to test the overarching hypothesis that PR8-elicited nascent BC that ultimately colonize damaged alveolar
regions are derived from IS cells through a fate transition that is regulated by TAp63. Furthermore, we
hypothesize that AT2-derived Lcn2 mediates BC recruitment to injured alveoli where they regulate local Wnt
signaling and inhibit AT2 cell proliferation. Aim 1 will examine the role of TAp63 and its downstream targets in
IS>BC specification following PR8-induced lung injury. Aim 2 will investigate roles for AT2-derived Lcn2 in
recruitment of PR8-elicited BC to injured alveoli. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that nascent BC recruited to sites
of parenchymal injury suppress the regenerative capacity of surviving AT2 cells and will explore roles for BC-
derived Wnt ligands in this process. Completion of these aims will provide new insights into cellular and molecular
mechanisms of repair in acute lung injury and how persistent activation of these repair pathways might contribute
to tissue remodeling in lung disease."

Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes and hypertension, impact two-thirds of people in the
United States and are among the leading causes of death worldwide. CMDs lead to devastating consequences
for those afflicated by them, such as the increased risk of vascular and heart disease, leading to future lethal
complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Importantly, these conditions do not impact all individuals
equally. CMDs are more prevalent in Hispanics/Latinos, and this population suffers worse complications and
outcomes than non-Hispanic whites. While lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition play a role in CMD
development, the potential contributions of environmental exposures has not been well-established. Starr
County, Texas, is a predominantly Mexican-American community with staggering rages of CMDs, specifically
diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, our preliminary data indicate that metal and metalloid exposures may increase
the risk for CMDs and CMD-related traits in this population. Therefore, we hypothesize that exposure to
metals/metalloids contributes to the observed heightened risk of CMDs in this population. To address this, we
will leverage data from a well-established prospective cohort from Starr County, Texas, a community of >90%
Hispanic/Latino origin. Utilizing already measured urinary metal/metalloid concentrations, we will evaluate
longitudinal cardiovascular and metabolic trajectories of blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma
glucose, and homostatic measures of assessment for individual metal exposures and metal mixtures in 600
individuals over 3 years. Given the substantial individual and societal burden of CMDs, it is vital to identify
modifiable risk factors in order to empower action for disease prevention, detection, and treatment. Through the
project proposed in this application, valuable insight will be gained into the role of metal/metalloid exposures and
CMD risk in a historically underrepresented population in biomedical research. Lastly, through this proposed
research project and training plan, the applicant for this fellowship will receive comprehensive and
complementary mentorship from a team of experts with a long history of collaboration, numerous opportunities
for publication and presentation of scientific progress, and an overall outstanding education empowering her to
become an independent principal investigator and physician-scientist devoted to improving environmental health

10831540,"ABSTRACT
Muscular dystrophies impact an estimated 250,000 patients in the United States, resulting in an annual medical
expenditure of over $46 billion. The economic loss is more substantial in the congenital-onset muscular
dystrophies (CMDs), which manifest very early in life, due to patients' inability to enter the workforce and/or their
premature death. LAMA2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD), the most common form of
CMD, is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene encoding the LAMA2 protein. The lack of LAMA2 protein
causes degeneration of skeletal muscle and impaired Schwann cell myelination, resulting in a cascade of
secondary events that include apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, which ultimately precipitate the disease.
Patients are provided with disease symptom management, such as assisted ventilation, ambulatory services,
and physiotherapy to reduce contractures, but there is no curative option.
Owing to the genetic nature of the disease, the correction of mutations would be a promising treatment for
LAMA2-CMD. We have previously described the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to correct a splice site mutation in the
Lama2 gene and showed amelioration of disease phenotypes in a LAMA2-CMD mouse model. However, there
are more than 600 pathogenic mutations identified in the patient populations, which significantly hampers future
translation of any LAMA2 mutation correction strategy to patients.
In contrast, the attenuation of disease pathogenicity by targeted modulation of the expression of disease modifier
genes would be beneficial to all individuals affected with LAMA2-CMD. We were the first to develop a CRISPR
activation-based approach to postnatally upregulate a disease modifier gene Lama1, which is structurally and
functionally similar to Lama2, in the mouse model. These findings led to the hypothesis that targeted LAMA1
gene activation can serve as a mutation-independent therapeutic approach for LAMA2-CMD.
We will test this hypothesis by performing a dedicated preclinical evaluation of efficacy and safety profiles of
Lama1 upregulation in a severe LAMA2-CMD mouse model. In addition, we will bridge the translation of the
strategy from a mouse-to patient-relevant models and evaluate the effect of human LAMA1 upregulation on
cellular impairments, including mitochondrial respiration, migration, and myelination. Successful completion of
these experiments will pave the way towards the development of mutation-independent therapeutic interventions
for LAMA2-CMD and potentially other muscular dystrophies."

If this cooperative agreement is awarded, the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control (DHEC) and the South Carolina Department of Agriculture
(SCDA) will work in collaboration to maintain the South Carolina Rapid Response Team
(SCRRT). Alongside the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), South Carolina Meat-
Poultry Inspection Department, and South Carolina Emergency Management Division,
the SCRRT responds to human and animal food (HAF) incidents. Fulfilling the
overarching, broad objectives of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is
essential for the realization of DHEC’s visions: utilizing standardized approaches for
food industry regulation, protecting public health, and securing the safety of South
Carolina’s food supply. SCRRT Coordinators will use relevant concepts from the RRT
Best Practices Manual to continue to build RRT capacity and framework for developing
response capability. Monthly in-person meetings between the DHEC and SCDA RRT
Coordinators and quarterly meetings with key agency personnel ensure that
collaboration and communication between the agencies occurs throughout the year, as
opposed to only in response to HAF incidents and outbreaks. Annually, SCRRT will
conduct at least one annual exercise to assess the capability of the RRT partners in
response to a HAF incident using Incident Command System (ICS) principles, including
timely notification to the FDA and other state partners and implementation of effective
control measures. An after-action report (AAR) will be used to identify policies and
procedures that require improvement. Key personnel from each agency will enhance
their knowledge and skills by completing FDA ORAU courses, developing proficiency in
environmental sampling and traceback procedures, and attending relevant meetings
and workshops. During the maintenance phase, funding for key personnel will be
transitioned from full-grant to partial-grant through supplementation of state funds
and/or alternate funding source(s); this funding transition promotes sustainability of the
SCRRT for DHEC and SCDA."
10859755,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 In the past few years, several gene therapy products using adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been
approved for clinical use for treatment of non-cardiac diseases. However, existing data indicate extremely low
cardiac uptake of AAV in human hearts, hampering clinical translation of cardiac gene therapy. My lab has
recently developed a clinically applicable approach to overcome this low AAV uptake. Our preliminary data
indicate that intracoronary delivery of AAV during simultaneous occlusions of coronary artery and sinus (stop-
flow delivery) results in globally increased gene expression with up to 500-fold higher expression compared to
the standard antegrade delivery, even in pigs with pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against AAV. Unique to
our approach, we ensure safety by supporting the systemic hemodynamics and alleviating cardiac ischemia
using a catheter-based cardiac assist device. Our method will thus offer minimally invasive, safe, but efficacious
gene delivery to human hearts.
 Although our preliminary data is strong, we still lack understanding in how and which delivery-related
factor(s) contributed to improved gene expression. Defining key factor(s) that led to significant improvement will
allow us to rationally design AAV gene delivery for further refinement.
 In this application, we propose inter-connected, but independent Aims in large animal heart failure
models to: 1.Identify the key mechanical factor(s), 2. Understand uptake mechanisms and 3.Establish clinically
applicable delivery protocol. Based on our preliminary data, we will focus on capillary pressure and dwell time in
Aim 1 as key factors, endothelial permeability and vesicular AAV uptake in Aim 2 as potential mechanisms of
improvement, and clarify remaining uncertain issues for clinical realization in Aim 3, which include optimal
serotype for targeting human heart, antibody inhibition, and defining optimal patient population for stop-flow gene
therapy.
 Our proposal is conceptually novel in focusing on various factors in delivery (mechanical, biological and
pathological), in contrast to the majority of delivery-focused studies only testing methods of their interest.
Additional innovative points include exploring repeat AAV dosing, mechanistic studies of cardiac AAV uptake,
and treating hibernating myocardium using gene therapy.
 By further improving our promising AAV gene delivery method that allows efficient and safe cardiac gene
expression, an obstacle currently plaguing the clinical translation of cardiac AAV gene therapy will be overcome."

Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; ages 13-17) experience higher rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) than
their heterosexual peers, including being more likely to experience psychological and physical abuse, 9-11 and
being four times more likely to experience rape. 12 However, this emerging body of literature has a number of
significant limitations. First (Aim 1), studies have largely failed to look beyond victimization of IPV and have not
measured IPV perpetration among SMA. Second (Aim 1), studies of IPV among SMA have approached SMA
as a homogenous group and have not identified within-group differences in SMAs' experience of IPV, including
by race, ethnicity, gender identity, or urbanicity. Research has been inconclusive in these regards, making
hypotheses difficult, 13-20 although differences may inform intervention. Third (Aim 2), identified associations
between the experience of IPV and negative health outcomes (i.e. mental health symptomology, substance use,
homelessness) are largely cross-sectional: the temporal relationships between IPV and behavioral health for
SMA across adolescence remains unclear. 21 Fourth (Aim 3), almost nothing is known of the unique etiological
factors that influence IPV experiences for SMA. While cross-sectional studies have identified relationships
between sexuality-based minority stress 22 and sexual assault, 13, 23-26 the prospective literature is nearly
nonexistent. Finally (Aim 3), even less is known about how SMA-specific protective factors (such as access to
LGBT-friendly services) 27-28,29-33 may attenuate IPV trajectories. In general, the only longitudinal studies of IPV
among SMA to date are limited by (a) the inclusion of violence only in the context of dating; (b) a failure to assess
perpetration or bidirectional IPV; (c) a reliance on single-city urban samples largely composed of adults (18+);
and (d) the inclusion of no, or limited, measures of minority stress and resilience. We propose to address these
limitations, and to explain the prospective relationships between IPV experiences (including victimization and
perpetration), risk and resilience factors, and other behavioral health outcomes in a diverse cohort of SMA (ages
13–17 at baseline). We rely on methods refined in our prior work (1R01MD012252) to recruit a national sample
of diverse SMA (i.e., race and ethnicity, gender, urbanicity; N = 1,500) through a hybrid social media and
respondent-driven sampling strategy. We will follow participants for 36 months. Proposed by established MPIs
(Goldbach, Stephenson), Co-Is (Rhoades, Schrager), and a biostatistician (Mamey) in this area, 39-44 our efforts
are centered on identifying targets for future interventions to reduce the significant burden of IPV carried by this
population."
10841692,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Digital interventions offer a highly scalable and relatively cost- and time-efficient approach to the delivery of
accessible mental health services. However, evidence for efficacy comes from nomothetic group averages,
overlooking the fact that a treatment that is effective for one patient may be less effective or even harmful for
another. Further, guidance on matching individuals to their optimal intervention is lacking. These decisions are
primarily based on clinical judgment or “trial and error,” which results in many patients receiving ineffective
treatment or requiring multiple courses of treatment before achieving remission. Machine learning (ML)
algorithms offer an alternative to conventional clinical decision-making by generating empirically derived
precision treatment rules (PTRs) for selecting an optimal treatment. To date, research on the development of
PTRs has been hindered by major design and statistical issues, including sample size limitations and lack of
random assignment.
 The primary objective of the proposed study is to develop and test PTRs, using ML, for three evidence-
based digital mental health interventions, within an existing digital healthcare system, SilverCloud Health (SC).
A secondary objective is to better understand user-engagement as a mechanism of treatment response. In
partnership with primary care physicians at Kaiser Permanente (KP), we will conduct a large (N = 1,800)
randomized clinical trial where participants will be randomly assigned to one of three digital interventions in
SC’s suite: Unified Protocol, Space from Depression, and Space for Resilience. Aim 1 will evaluate the overall
effects and engagement patterns of the three digital interventions. Aim 2 will use ML to develop treatment-
matching algorithms and determine the extent these precision treatment rules lead to improvements in clinical
outcomes and engagement. Aim 3 will determine if user engagement and other common and specific factors
(e.g., working alliance, negative thinking) are mechanisms of treatment response. The results of this study will
provide a definitive answer regarding the relative effectiveness of three leading digital interventions, determine
the value of developing PTRs for CBT interventions with different purported mechanisms of action, and further
the understanding of common and treatment-specific mechanisms of change."

10840611,"Project Summary
 This research program focuses on two inadequately understood metalloprotein systems that are linked
to health and human disease and aims to uncover the mechanistic underpinnings of these essential biological
processes. The first biological process of focus is bacterial ferrous iron (Fe2+) generation, acquisition, and
sensing. The chief prokaryotic Fe2+ acquisition system is the Feo system, which is present in nearly all bacteria
and is used by pathogens to establish infection in mammalian hosts. Our previous work has begun to unravel
the mechanistic details of this important iron acquisition pathway. Importantly, there is an emerging connection
between Feo and additional membrane-bound proteins that function more broadly in bacterial Fe2+ homeostasis
through the sensing Fe2+ to control biofilm formation (BqsR/S) and the utilization of Fe3+-siderophores to supply
Fe2+ to the Feo system (membrane ferric reductases or mFRs). This proposal outlines a comprehensive
approach to study these three systems (Feo, Bqs, mFRs) both in vitro and in vivo. Leveraging structural,
spectroscopic, and biochemical analyses, this proposal aims to define the mechanism of bacterial Fe2+
generation, acquisition, and sensing, which will position future researchers to explore the urgent but broadly
impactful possibility that these systems may be exploited to combat bacterial virulence. The second biological
process of focus is eukaryotic post-translational arginylation, catalyzed by the enzyme arginyltransferase 1
(ATE1). ATE1-catalyzed arginylation typically targets the N-terminus of proteins, altering protein function and
fate in vivo. Normal ATE1 activity is critical for neurogenesis, cardiovascular development, cancer, and viral
infections, but the structural and mechanistic details of ATE1-mediated arginylation are sorely lacking, prohibiting
the targeting of this system for therapeutic intervention. Our previous work has uncovered the structure of yeast
ATE1 for the first time, has shown that ATE1s are O2-sensitive [Fe-S] proteins, and has developed a mechanistic
framework for post-translational arginylation. This proposal aims to uncover the structure of the arginylation
complex and its link to O2 sensitivity, to determine the structure of a mammalian ATE1, and to understand the
evolution of ATE1. To achieve this goal, this proposal combines in vitro and in vivo structural, biochemical, and
functional methods to elucidate the components of post-translation arginylation in order to design small
molecules that target ATE1 for intervention. Combined, the results from this proposal hold the promise to aid in
the development of therapeutics to abrogate bacterial virulence linked to iron homeostasis and to treat cellular
diseases linked to post-translational arginylation."

Intellectual disability is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by limited intellectual functioning
and impaired adaptive behavior. The clinical heterogeneity of intellectual disability is reflected by extreme genetic
complexity, leaving etiology unresolved in over 60% of diagnosed patients. Underscoring this complexity, lesions
in more than 700 genes have been linked to intellectual disability. Critically, emerging evidence suggests that
this diverse group of these genes converge on a limited set of molecular pathways, principally those critical for
brain development and function. This convergence suggests that studies of monogenic, experimentally tractable
forms of intellectual disability can provide molecular insight into mechanisms common to all forms of the disease.
Interestingly, many of the genes linked to intellectual disability encode RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that play
critical roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. My mentors’ labs co-discovered one such
monogenic form of intellectual disability caused by loss of function mutations in the ubiquitously expressed RBP
ZC3H14. To discover why mutations in the ZC3H14 gene impair brain function, we have developed an
experimentally tractable model of ZC3H14 loss by deleting the ortholog, Nab2, in the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster. This work has revealed that Nab2 is expressed in all cells but required specifically in neurons
within the developing nervous system to support axon guidance, locomotion, and olfactory memory. However,
the identity of ZC3H14/Nab2-regulated RNAs as well as mechanisms that elevate ZC3H14/Nab2 function in
neurons remain elusive. Recently, my labs have uncovered evidence for a novel role of Nab2 as a regulator of
alternative splicing through inhibition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) deposition on a subset of neuronally enriched
mRNAs, representing a critical layer of epitranscriptomic regulation of gene expression during neuronal
development. Thus, I will test the hypothesis that Nab2 governs m6A-dependent expression of key neuronal
targets by binding their pre-mRNA transcripts and inhibiting m6A hypermethylation to govern proper brain
morphology and function here by focusing on one Nab2-regulated transcript, trio, which displays aberrant intron
retention upon loss of Nab2. The Trio protein is conserved in vertebrates, the TRIO gene is mutated in a dominant
form of human intellectual disability, and Trio plays a key role in axon guidance and neuronal morphology. The
Specific Aims of this project are to: 1) define the role of Nab2 as a regulator of m6A-dependent expression of
neuronally-enriched transcripts; and 2) examine how Nab2-dependent regulation of Trio expression governs
development of axon tracts in the Drosophila mushroom body, an analog of the hippocampus that supports
olfactory and gustatory memory. Successful completion of the proposed Aims will provide insights into an
apparently conserved pathway linking Nab2 to Trio expression through a neuron-specific role in m6A-regulated
splicing, uncovering more general links between m6A, splicing, and neurodevelopmental defects in humans. The
proposed collaborative research project will provide me with an optimal training experience."

DNA cytosine methylation (hereafter, DNA methylation) has a critical role in cell lineage specification as well as
suppression of repetitive and transposable elements in the genome. DNA methyltransferases attach a methyl
group to generate 5-methylcytosine (5mC); TET methylcytosine dioxygenases cause DNA demethylation by
oxidizing the methyl group of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and beyond. We have shown that TET-
deficient cell types display not only the expected increase in DNA methylation at promoters and enhancers, but
also a paradoxical decrease in DNA methylation in heterochromatic regions of the genome. The consequences
of these molecular features remain to be understood, but similar alterations in genome-wide DNA methylation
patterns have been observed in cancer and aging.
By studying the phenotypes of several mouse strains in which Cre recombinase was expressed either inducibly
or developmentally in immune/ hematopoietic cell types, we showed that deletion of two or more Tet genes
skewed cell lineage commitment in the relevant cell type, in a manner that correlated with changes in cell lineage
commitment. More striking phenotypes, however, were that Tet2/3 fl/fl CD4Cre mice displayed massive TCR-
dependent expansion of iNKT cells; and that Tet2/3 fl/fl Foxp3Cre mice developed a dominant proinflammatory
phenotype observed in heterozygous female mice, in mixed bone marrow chimaeras, and in immunocompetent
recipients injected with total CD4+ T cells from Tet2/3 fl/fl Foxp3Cre mice. This phenotype differs markedly from
that observed in heterozygous Foxp3+/- females and in immunocompetent mice injected with Foxp3-deficient
cells, which do not develop disease. In Aim 1, we will address the mechanisms underlying the striking expansion
of Tet2/3-deficient iNKT cells by using adoptive transfer approaches in vivo and recently-developed cell culture
systems that recapitulate the expansion in vitro. In Aim 2, we will ask whether the dominant autoimmune/
inflammatory phenotype of Tet2/3-deficient T regulatory cells requires, directly or indirectly, the decreased DNA
methylation in heterochromatin observed in every TET-deficient cell type examined so far. Decreased DNA
methylation in heterochromatin results in “heterochromatin dysfunction”, an aberrant cellular condition linked to
autoimmune/ inflammatory disorders, cancer, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases, that stems from aberrant
expression of transposable elements (TEs) and resulting DNA damage. DNA damage provokes “sterile
inflammation”: activation of innate immune sensing pathways for RNA and DNA with consequent upregulation
of type I interferons, interferon-induced genes and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1b, IL-6, IFNg, IL-17)
Our proposed experiments will add to our knowledge of how TET proteins influence T cell expansion and T
regulatory function. More broadly, they will enhance our general understanding of the links connecting TET
deficiency and TE expression with autoimmune/ inflammatory diseases, clonal hematopoiesis, a premalignant
syndrome of older individuals associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease, and cancer."

10842388,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of malignant-associated death in the USA with
inflammation as a key driving force for its development, growth, and progression. p38, a member of p38
mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK  , and ), is oncogenic, pro-inflammatory, and
overexpressed in clinical CRC but the role of epithelial p38 in CRC tumorigenesis has not been tested. -
catenin, a critical cofactor of Wnt transcription, is aberrantly activated in 90% of CRC. And yet, -catenin is
undruggable and there is thus an urgent need to identify druggable -catenin activators for therapeutic
intervention. Here we propose that p38 MAPK in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) drives CRC
tumorigenesis by stimulating oncogenic -catenin phosphorylation.
 This hypothesis is based on our preliminary studies showing that: 1) inflammation coordinately stimulates
p38 and -catenin phosphorylation in CRC cells; 2) p38 directly phosphorylates -catenin at S605, which
increases -catenin stability, the -catenin-TCF4 interaction, Wnt transcription and CRC growth; 3)
inflammation activates p38, but not p38, in intestinal tissues of mice, and IEC-specific p38 knockout (KO)
reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and attenuates colitis severity; 4) IEC p38 KO inhibits colon
tumorigenesis and p--catenin/S605/Wnt signaling in the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)
mouse model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC); 5) the p38 pharmacological inhibitor pirfenidone (PFD)
suppresses -catenin/cytokine expression and colon tumorigenesis in wild-type (WT) mice, but not in p38 KO
mice, and further collaborates with the -catenin-TCF4 interaction antagonist LF3 and chemotherapeutic drug
5FU to inhibit CRC growth, and 6) p38 is upregulated in clinical CAC specimens and in intestinal tissues of
Apcmin and interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mice. These results together indicate that IEC p38 is required for
tumorigenesis of both CAC and sporadic CRC by stimulating oncogenic -catenin phosphorylation.
Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we will test this hypothesis by determining (1) if p38-
induced -catenin/S605 phosphorylation stimulates -catenin nuclear translocation, -catenin-TCF4
interaction, Wnt transcription and CRC growth; (2) if IEC-specific p38 KO blocks tumorigenesis in IL-
10-/- and Apcmin mice and if p38 is essential for the -catenin/TCF4/Wnt signaling to promote malignant
progression in CRC pathogenesis; and (3) if the p38 pharmacological inhibitor pirfenidone (PFD)
blocks CRC tumorigenesis and increases the growth-inhibitory activity of LF3 and 5FU by disrupting
the p38/-catenin/TCF4/Wnt pathway. Upon completion, these studies will demonstrate if epithelial p38
promotes CRC tumorigenesis by stimulating oncogenic -catenin/S605 phosphorylation and Wnt transcription.
Demonstrating the effectiveness of PFD in inhibiting Wnt signaling and CRC tumorigenesis by targeting
intestinal epithelial p38 will reveal that drugging p38 has a great potential for colon cancer targeted therapy."

Mathematical cognition provides a foundation for the development of quantitative skills critical for functioning in
the 21st century. Yet, math difficulties are widespread in children, adolescents, and college students, and one
in five adults in the USA is functionally innumerate. Low numeracy is associated with poorer health
outcomes, reduced health literacy, and improper use of health resources. Characterizing neurocognitive
developmental trajectories and risk factors of mathematical disabilities (MD) is critical for addressing the public
health burdens of innumeracy. Building on an innovative and high-impact line of research, we propose to
investigate neurocognitive longitudinal trajectories and outcomes in MD. We focus on two key cognitive
domains impaired in MD: (1) number sense, including representations of quantities, numbers, and their
mental manipulation, and (2) arithmetic skills, including numerical problem solving and fluent retrieval of math
facts from memory. Our central hypothesis is that, relative to typically developing (TD) controls, individuals
with MD will exhibit atypical developmental trajectories of brain response, representations, and connectivity in
two functional brain systems: (1) the parietal visuo-spatial attention system, which supports quantity
representations, and (2) the medial temporal (MTL) declarative memory system, which supports arithmetic
fact retrieval. We will test (1) core and access deficit models of atypical number sense development and (2)
a memory deficit model of weak fact retrieval. Using state-of-the-art multimodal brain imaging and three
innovative longitudinal designs, we will test these models by (1) characterizing developmental trajectories in
children and adolescents, spanning elementary, middle, and high school years (ages 7 to 16), with an
accelerated longitudinal design; (2) identify brain measures that predict longitudinal 2-year early math
trajectories and outcomes in young children prior to formal instruction or MD diagnosis (ages 5-7); and (3)
identify brain measures that predict longitudinal 10-year long-term math outcomes in adolescents (age 17)
who were previously characterized in childhood. Three innovative longitudinal designs will address critical gaps
in our understanding of neurocognitive systems impacted over development in MD. Findings will inform our
understanding of the etiology of MD and the development of targeted cognitive interventions that may
ultimately reduce the public health burden of low numeracy."
10842490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metal ions are required nutrients for cellular function, but can also be toxic if misregulated. Our immune system
leverages this dichotomy by deploying mechanisms both to withhold nutrient metals from pathogens as well as
overwhelm them with toxic levels, particularly of Cu and Zn. Metal imbalances at the cellular level have also
been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and are being investigated as possible anticancer strategies.
But what exactly are the targets and mechanisms of cellular metal stress? The research proposed here explores
this question of cellular metal stress by seeking to identify protein targets of aberrant metal interactions by
measuring global changes in protein stability across the proteome. The proposed work builds on preliminary and
recently published results from this collaborative team showing the utility of a pulse proteolysis mass
spectrometry method developed in co-PI Fitzgerald’s laboratory to identify protein targets of Cu in E. coli,
establishing these proteomic methodologies for the study of metal-protein interactions. The overall objective of
the current application is to identify proteins that are functionally affected when cells experience stress induced
by exposure to excess levels of Zn and Cu. This objective will be met by using a powerful combination of mass
spectrometry-based proteomic methods to address four specific aims: 1) Determine global profiles of protein
stability changes as a function of cellular metal overload and metal deficiency across bacterial, fungal, and
human cancer cells; 2) Establish a mechanistic basis linking differential stability of Aim 1 proteins to function; 3)
Identify the relative sensitivity of proteins across the proteome to misfolding induced by Cu and Zn binding; and
4) Establish a biophysical basis for understanding the relative sensitivity of proteins to metal-induced misfolding.
Understanding how protein stability is impacted across the proteome upon exposure to normal or aberrant levels
of Cu and Zn has important implications for understanding metal-induced toxicity and mechanisms cells use to
maintain metal homeostasis in the face of metal-associated stress. By studying proteomes from microbial, fungal,
and human cancer cells, the outcomes of these studies will advance our understanding of how these organisms
respond at the proteome level to changing metal environments imposed by the host immune system. These
studies will inform and impact the development of pharmacological agents against microbial pathogens and
cancer cells, and align with the applicant’s long-term goals to develop chemical tools to manipulate biological
metal ion location, speciation, and reactivity for potential therapeutic benefit."

Our goal is to develop a quantitative framework for the generation, boosting and maintenance of
immunological memory. Mathematical models are useful because immunization and infection involve the
interaction of rapidly changing populations of virus and multiple populations of immune cells. We first
develop and validate models using experiments in mice. We then use these validated models to analyze
data from human vaccination studies.
Aim 1 asks how prior immunity affects and potentially limit the boosting of immunity and apply this to
influenza. Our approach is to develop models to understand why prior immunity limits boosting of
antibodies to conserved regions of the virus. Specifically, we use our models to better understand how
prior immunity might limit boosting of antibody responses to conserved regions on the stem of the
hemagglutinin molecule that is the focus of universal influenza vaccines.
Aim 2 considers the factors that affect the durability of humoral immune memory, and address questions
such as why memory generated by immunization with protein antigens is less durable than immunity
generated by virus infection, and how prior immunity can differentially affect the boosting and generation
of memory to new strains of influenza.
Aim 3 considers the generation of CD8 T cell memory to influenza and yellow fever. We will determine
how repeated exposure to influenza affects the diversity of the CD8 T cell responses generated. We have
access to a unique dataset that follows the number of YFV-specific CD8 T cells, changes in their
phenotype, and their turnover from heavy water labelling studies for a period of over one year. Our analysis
of this dataset will allow us to address an ongoing controversy regarding whether are long-term memory
CD8 memory stem cells are generated rapidly after immunization or only gradually over time.
Aim 4 describes computational tools that we will build for B cell receptor sequence analysis and
visualization, and for simulation of the dynamics of immune responses. These tools will be widely
accessible online, and promoted at workshops and scientific symposia we organize."

HIV assembly occurs at the plasma membrane within specialized membrane microdomains (commonly known
as lipid rats) that exhibit reduced lateral mobility owing to an enrichment of saturated lipids including PIP2,
ceramide, sphingomyelin, and sterols. The HIV-1 Gag precursor protein targets to the inner leaflet of these
plasma membrane microdomains and regulates essential events required for virion assembly and budding.
However, the mechanisms by which Gag regulates the formation of these microdomains and the role for these
microdomains in viral assembly is currently unknown. Here we provide the first evidence that Gag co-localizes
with the sphingomyelin hydrolase nSMase2 (which catalyzes the formation of ceramide from sphingomyelin),
and that nSMase2 is a critical regulator of HIV replication. In preliminary experiments we discovered that this
enzyme is required for the successful completion of the late stages of HIV assembly and maturation.
Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of nSMase2 prevented the processing of Gag and resulted in the
production of irregularly shaped immature non-infectious virions. In humanized HIV infected mice, inhibition of
nSMase2 produced a linear decrease of viral loads to below detectable limits in the majority of animals tested.
More importantly, animals who achieved viral loads below detectable limits with treatment, did not exhibit viral
rebound when drug administration was discontinued. The findings from these studies will increase our basic
understanding of the viral replication cycle by describing for the first time a role for nSMase2 and ceramide in
HIV replication."

Cryptococcosis, due to infection by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, is the most
common cause of culture-positive meningitis worldwide. T helper (Th) cells are paramount to host defenses.
The overarching goal of this project is the preclinical advancement of a subunit vaccine to protect at risk
populations (e.g., HIV+, transplant recipients, residents of endemic areas) from cryptococcosis. Our working
hypothesis is using carefully designed mouse and human studies, we can rationally develop a subunit
multiantigen vaccine for eventual human testing. We further postulate that given HLA diversity in the human
population and diversity amongst cryptococcal strains, a successful human cryptococcal “T cell vaccine” will
consist of three protein antigens combined with a potent Th-stimulating adjuvant. Aim 1. Determine the
protective efficacy of adjuvanted single antigen candidate antigens using mouse models of
cryptococcosis. We have identified seven cryptococcal proteins which, when expressed recombinantly in E.
coli and packaged into vaccines, significantly protected two inbred mouse strains against an otherwise lethal
challenge with C. neoformans. We will evaluate the protective efficacy of these antigens formulated with our
lead adjuvant, CAF01, against representative virulent cryptococcal strains found worldwide. Aim 2. Dissect
murine and human immunologic responses to candidate vaccine antigens. We will investigate ex vivo
immune responses to candidate antigens and the in vivo role of arms of the immune system. Lung recall CD4+
and CD8+ T cell (including memory) responses following murine vaccination and challenge will be determined.
Vaccine protection studies will be undertaken under conditions where mice have CD4+ T cell compromise,
thereby modeling the major human risk factors for cryptococcosis, especially HIV. The role of antibody will be
studied with gain of function and loss of function experiments. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the
seven candidate vaccine antigens will be compared using human PBMCs from subjects with and without
cryptococcosis. Aim 3. Test immunogenicity and protection with antigen combinations. We will select
from the seven antigens a lead vaccine formulation consisting of three antigens adjuvanted in CAF01. This
goal will be accomplished by prioritizing the top antigens based on the studies in the first two aims and then
testing vaccines containing antigen combinations for immunogenicity and protection in mouse models of
cryptococcosis. We anticipate by the end of the granting period we will have a subunit cryptococcal vaccine
ready to be moved forward for further preclinical development and eventual clinical trials. The proposed studies
address a major global health need for the development of cryptococcal vaccines, provide insights into the
immunopathogenesis of cryptococcosis, and establish proofs of principle applicable to other vaccine-
preventable diseases."

The Vanderbilt-Meharry BIRCWH Program seeks to increase the pool of well-prepared investigators dedicated
to expanding knowledge about women's health via advances in sex and gender biology. Our scholars conduct
research across five thematic areas of exceptional institutional strength emphasizing five methodologic
approaches to actualize personalized prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics for girls and women.
Leveraging a tradition of research excellence, scholars have access to many ongoing cohorts taking a lifespan
approach, existing interdisciplinary units in all of our thematic areas, and large-scale clinical and population-
level data linked to DNA and biospecimens, including prominent consortia. This environment creates synergy
for robust mechanistic and therapeutic research to deliver discoveries both inside and outside the lab. Our 36
former and current scholars conduct research as varied as immunologic and genetic aspects of lupus, gender
differences in outcomes of intensive care unit care, sex differences in resilience to Alzheimer's, and role of sex
hormones in T cell differentiation and cytokine expression in asthma onset and severity. Scholars are 81%
women and 28% identify with minority race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disadvantaged status historically
underrepresented in research. Nearly all remain in research. During training, scholars average 8 publications a
year, and alumni have been awarded 107 extramural grants worth over $50 million total. BIRCWH Scholars
are grounded in fundamentals of women's health and sex differences research, prepared to lead collaborative
teams, trained to effectively deploy innovative interdisciplinary approaches to attack and solve problems, and
committed to pursuing research that optimizes the health of all women. Scholars are selected by competitive
review of applications from early career faculty. Training is tailored to the individual scholar guided by
structured interdisciplinary mentorship and is overseen by a trio of Co-PIs who are all former BIRCWH
Scholars. Program resources are further extended by myriad institutional resources that ensure our
researchers thrive. Scholars form a mentoring panel, participate in weekly BIRCWH work-in-progress sessions
and seminars, receive formal evaluation twice a year, attend twice-monthly career development seminar series
with other K-awardees, and are regularly exposed to case studies on responsible conduct of rigorous and
reproducible research. They have access to: 1) an array of cores; 2) biostatistics consults; 3) manuscript
preparation groups; 4) technical editing of completed products; 5) studios with experts to vet scientific ideas,
aims, and research designs; 6) intramural pilot funding; 7) grant writing support including grant workshops, a
library of funded grants, and internal study sections; and 8) new expert consultations to design fully
individualized training plans termed Pathways. We deploy evaluation tools to continuously enhance our
program with oversight by an advisory committee and site visitors. Combined, this ensures we carefully
support excellence and build diversity in the next generation of women's health researchers."

Undertreatment of childhood asthma is prevalent and often the right treatment for incident cases is unknown hence the
widespread use of therapeutic trials as a treatment strategy. Two-thirds of incident childhood asthma cases continue to
have persistent symptoms even after treatment initiation. Missed opportunities for early efficacious treatment contribute to
increased risk of childhood asthma-associated morbidity (i.e., uncontrolled asthma) that exerts a substantial burden on
patients, families, and the healthcare system. However, clinical decision-making tools needed to identify which child will
benefit from which treatment at an early stage are currently lacking. This proposal is predicated on the notion that
applying novel machine learning (ML) methodologies to increasingly available electronic health record (EHR)
risk/prognostic data can generate predictive analytics and insights regarding childhood asthma treatment response.
Clinicians can then use such insights toward effective treatment decision-making at point of care, including more
proactive and personalized treatment, for improved patient-centered outcomes. Although risk and prognostic factors
needed for treatment response prediction are often embedded in EHR, this information is sometimes overlooked by
clinicians. In busy pediatric clinics, active EHR review to identify such factors to inform treatment decisions can be
costly, time-consuming, error-prone, and infeasible. To address these challenges and technological gap, we propose to
develop, validate, and evaluate a childhood asthma Passive Digital Marker for treatment response prediction (PDM-TR),
that is, a ML algorithm that can retrieve and synthesize pre-existing 'passively' collected mother-child dyad
risk/prognostic data in 'digital' EHR to provide an objective and quantifiable 'marker' of treatment response. We
hypothesize that when applied to risk/prognostic EHR data derived from incident asthma cases exposed to first-line
treatments, our PDM-TR will predict asthma control at 2-3 months with high accuracy (≥80 sensitivity and ≥80
specificity). The PDM-TR will 'learn from existing EHR data' to predict whether a specific treatment may be successful
(i.e., achieve asthma control) for a given individual with a specific set of attributes (i.e., asthma risk and prognostic factors
[e.g., history of allergy sensitization, eczema, demographics, lung function, body mass index]). Applying our novel PDM-
TR in-real time to readily available EHR data could contribute towards the development of a timely, accurate and scalable
approach to inform personalized childhood asthma treatment at point of care."

One in three patients across neurological and psychiatric disorders are treatment resistant. Neuromodulation could
provide these patients with treatment options, but current invasive approaches carry significant risk, while noninvasive
approaches have low spatial resolution and cannot stimulate deep brain areas. Transcranial temporal interference
stimulation (TIS) is emerging as a novel tool that combines noninvasiveness with favorable focus, high focusing flexibility,
and the possibility to stimulate at depth. Successful applications to deep brain targets as well as flexible focusing have
been demonstrated in mice. This proposal takes the critical set of next steps so that TIS can be effectively applied to the
human brain.
In Aim 1, we will realize the key strength of TIS, applying it to deep brain nuclei of non-human primates. In a controlled
experiment, we will determine the intensity threshold that produces substantial effects on visual choice behavior, and
validate the safety of the stimulation. In Aim 2, we will apply TIS to the motor cortex of humans and use an established
method to elicit and measure motor evoked potentials in relation to the phase of the TIS waveform. Using this metric, we
will i) validate that effects of TIS are due to the beat pattern and not the carrier, ii) evaluate the effect of the TIS carrier
frequency, and iii) devise protocols for transient and sustained neuromodulation.
Together, our work provides protocols for effective and safe TIS modulation of the human brain. This development has
the potential to provide noninvasive and spatially specific treatment options to the large number of patients with brain
disorders that are resistant to, our counter-indicated for, existing forms of treatments."
10841320,"Project Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the death of retinal ganglion cells and their
axons in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy, and traumatic optic neuropathy. Retinal ganglion cells are particularly
vulnerable to dysfunction because the cells have high metabolic demands and axons
that are prone to damage as they exit the eye. Under normal conditions, ganglion cells
require an abundance of ATP to maintain cellular membrane potential, regulate calcium
levels, and to remove glutamate from synapses; these demands increase when exposed
to oxidative stress. A proposed treatment to manage oxidative stress following trauma to
the optic nerve is administration of compounds to support mitochondrial function. Our
laboratory has identified a high-density aromatic peptide (HDAP2) that targets cardiolipin
on the inner mitochondrial membrane and optimizes the mitochondrial membrane
potential under conditions of oxidative stress.
We propose to study the effect of HDAP2 in adult mice following optic nerve crush on
the survival of retinal ganglion cells, their dendritic arbors and the morphology of
mitochondria within affected neurons. Optic nerve crush closely approximates the partial
loss of optic nerve function and secondary loss of retinal ganglion cells observed in
many neurodegenerative diseases (Goldblum and Mittag, 2002; Levkovitch-Verbin et al.,
2000) and allows study of both primary and secondary effects of the trauma. Our
preliminary results have shown that administration of HDAP2 following optic nerve crush
significantly increases the survival of retinal ganglion cells following the procedure,
demonstrating its potential for preserving neuronal function."
10843129,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Offspring resemble their parents on nearly every trait investigated but understanding the causes of this
similarity has proven challenging. Traditional genetically informative approaches, such as adoption and
extended twin family designs, have proven valuable in helping to disentangle the genetic and environmental
causes for parents-offspring similarity, but the validity of their results rest upon strong assumptions about the
reasons for covariance among relatives and they require data that is difficult to obtain and typically
proprietary. Here, we introduce a genetically informative design, SEMPGS, that uses polygenic scores to
estimate the total variation in offspring traits that is due to vertical transmission (VT), which occurs when a
parental trait directly influences an offspring trait via the offspring’s rearing environment. This estimate of VT
is based on observable genetic data and does not depend on strong assumptions about the causes of relative
covariances. SEMPGS can utilize existing publicly available biobank and cohort data, greatly expanding the
range of data sources available to answer questions about parent-offspring resemblance.
Here, we propose to extend and refine the SEMPGS approach in ways that will make its results more accurate
and that can provide novel insights into parental influences on offspring. These developments include testing
and accounting for mechanisms of assortative mating, testing whether VT differs depending on the sex of the
parent and/or offspring, designing multivariate models that assess whether a parental trait influences different
offspring trait(s), and developing approaches for testing which specific parental behaviors underlie
observations of VT. We will use existing and proposed SEMPGS models in three large datasets totaling ~61.5K
trios, 62K parent-offspring duos, ~39K siblings and ~141K spousal pairs to explore the role of VT on offspring
mental health. Our studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which parental traits influence symptoms of
depression and attentional deficits in offspring, and they will also elucidate the consequences that parental
depression has on their offspring’s physical and mental well-being. Moreover, by investigating the correlations
of polygenic scores across spouses, our studies will help clarify the causes of spousal similarity across multiple
traits. By project’s end, we anticipate having tools that provide researchers with a new way to disentangle the
causes of parent-offspring resemblance, allowing for a clearer understanding of the causes and consequences of
mental disorders and other complex traits."
10843646,"Project Summary: The proposed T32 Integrated Mental Health Fellowship is designed to train clinician scientists who are
interested in improving the quality of mental health care delivered in primary care, medical subspecialty, and school‐based
clinics. Faculty supervisors will include senior investigators in the University of Washington (UW) Departments of
Psychiatry, Pediatrics, Family Medicine, as well as Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, and the Puget
Sound VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Center for Innovation. The training program combines
mentored research with didactic opportunities in the nationally renowned UW School of Public Health, the NIH Clinical
and Translational Science Award funded UW Institute for Translational Health Sciences and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Center. Research training will include graduate level coursework in biostatistics, epidemiology, health services research,
and implementation science, seminars led by program faculty from two NIMH‐funded P50 Centers, statistical consultation,
journal clubs, grant writing bootcamps, and a weekly works‐in‐progress seminar and one‐on‐one mentoring. A strength
of the proposed training program is the longstanding cross‐disciplinary training between psychiatrists, clinical
psychologists, family practice physicians, pediatricians, and health services researchers. Our Integrated Mental Health
Fellowship is the only NIMH‐funded T32 program geographically located in the Pacific Northwest. Over the past 35 years,
this continually funded T32 program has trained 43 fellows, including 38 physicians, and 5 psychologists. According to
Scopus our former fellows have published 1,568 peer‐reviewed journal articles and have been cited 131,464 times. Under
the overall leadership of MPIs Drs. Unützer and Fortney, Co‐Directors Drs. Comtois, Richardson and Bennett will
collaborate in the management of the program including governance, general mentorship, recruitment, selection,
progress monitoring, and career planning for fellows. Two postdoctoral fellows will be admitted to the program each year
such that four fellows will participate at any given time. Recruiting fellows from Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic
Minority groups is prioritized, though we also take an inclusive perspective that diversity also relates to sexual identity,
gender identity, ability, veteran status and disadvantaged background. At the start of fellowship, each fellow’s educational
needs will be formally assessed using a standardized template. This formal assessment of strengths and development
areas will be used to generate an Individual Development Plan. The fellow is expected to re‐visit and update the plan
quarterly, allowing a time for self‐reflection and assessment of their productivity and progress towards their scientific
career goals. Fellows without advanced research degrees will be encouraged to complete a Master of Science degree in
the UW School of Public Health. All fellows will also engage in one or more research projects supervised by their mentors.
The fellows mentors and research projects are proposed as part of the fellowship application process, so progress on
research projects can being immediately upon program entry. By the end of the two‐year fellowship training program,
we expect graduates to be capable of independent work and to be highly competitive for academic research faculty
positions."

This proposal is to develop a pre-shimmed parallel transmit array, an optimized receive array, and an RF/ΔB0
array to correct the severe B1 inhomogeneity, maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and correct B0
inhomogeneity in simultaneous human brain and spinal cord MR imaging 7 Tesla (T). Simultaneous functional
imaging of the brain and spinal cord can provide valuable insight into interactions and processing pathways
between these organs in normal and abnormal states of spinal cord injury, chronic pain, and motor disease. It is
emerging as a new tool to study the central nervous system and is necessary to enable new investigations of
task-based and resting-state sensory/motor processing throughout the cerebrum and spinal cord and shed new
light on the nature of resting-state networks within the cerebellum and spinal cord. 7T MRI offers new
opportunities to visualize structures of interest with high spatial resolution and enhanced conspicuity and to
detect brain function and networks with greater sensitivity. However, at high fields, B1 and B0 inhomogeneities,
and the lack of optimized receive coils for some specific applications are major challenges that limit imaging
performance. Existed designs are aimed at either brain-only or spinal-cord-only applications, and none have
solved all the challenges mentioned above. Moreover, the performance of these designs is limited by the small
number of transmit channels available from scanner vendors, and a lack of optimization for actual imaging
applications. The first goal of this project is to build a pre-shimmed transmit array which compresses 48 basic
coils into 8-“virtual” coils with RF pulse jointly optimized weights, to maximize the transmit performance of
standard 8-transmit-channel 7 Tesla scanners. The second goal of this project is to build a close-fitting massive-
element receive array with optimum coil geometry/layout/size, to provide high SNR and excellent parallel imaging
performance in both the whole brain and the spinal cord. The third goal of this project is to build routing-optimized
low-profile RF/ΔB0 array to correct B0 inhomogeneity with less hardware complications. The optimization
algorithms, electromagnetic simulation models, and electric/mechanical designs of the final pre-shimmed
transmit array, high dense receive array and the routing-optimized ΔB0 arrays, will be distributed for open access.
These transmit, receive, and ΔB0 arrays do not depend on the vendors’ platform and can be easily transferred
to other 7T sites, with benefits for the entire community."

The central objective of this proposal is to establish how Tet enzymes regulate the specification of blood cells
from endothelial cells during embryonic hematopoiesis, and from pluripotent stem cells in vitro. During embryo-
genesis, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) emerge from endothelial cells (ECs) in the arterial
vasculature. A sub-population of ECs undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to specify
hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs), which then give rise to HSPCs. This specification of ECs to HECs and to
HSPCs is guided by timely expression of hematopoietic genes involving the Runx, Gata and Gfi1 family of
transcription factors. While the developmental origins of hematopoietic cells are broadly defined, the molecular
mechanisms underlying blood formation are poorly understood. A major gap in the field has been how
epigenetic paradigms such as DNA methylation/demethylation regulate activation of hematopoietic programs in
ECs to allow for specification of HECs and formation of HSPCs. DNA methylation, a major modification that
silences genes, is deposited by the DNA methyltransferases and removed by the Tet DNA demethylases. Tet
enzymes are dynamically expressed during development and in many hematopoietic cell types. We have
developed two mouse models that allow for deletion of Tets temporally (post-gastrulation) as well as spatially
(in the endothelial lineage only) during embryogenesis. Using these models, we have recently shown that Tet
enzymes are essential for activation of hematopoietic-specific gene expression programs in ECs, and are
required for embryonic hematopoiesis in mice; functions that are distinct from the roles of Tet enzymes in adult
hematopoiesis. While these findings define a requirement for Tets in emergence of HSPCs from ECs, it is yet
to be established (1) how Tets specifically regulate EC-to-HEC commitment, (2) how Tet-mediated DNA
demethylation activate hematopoietic programs, (3) How are Tets recruited to hematopoietic enhancers, and
(4) whether Tets regulate and enhance derivation of HSPCs from pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesize that
Tet enzymes are required for EC-to-HEC transition where Tet-mediated demethylation in ECs is
essential for activation of hematopoietic enhancers. We also postulate that Tets regulate derivation of
HSPCs from pluripotent stem cells in vitro. We propose two aims. Aim 1 will define the requirements of Tet
enzymes in specification of HECs/HSPCs from ECs during embryonic hematopoiesis in vivo, and from mouse
embryonic stem cells in vitro. Aim 2 will establish how Tets are recruited to hematopoietic enhancers where
they demethylate and activate enhancers to promote transcription factor binding and expression of hemato-
poiesis programs. Our findings will establish Tets as major epigenetic regulators of hematopoietic lineage
specification in vivo and in vitro. It will inform on epigenetic basis of blood formation with implications in
treatment of blood disorders where Tets are mutated or dysregulated, and in generating blood cells from
pluripotent cells for clinical use."

The COBRE-Diabetes Phase 1 gave the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa (UHM) the ability to begin building a
Diabetes Research Center (DRC). We were able to mentor 7 Research Project Leaders and 7 Pilot Project
Investigators in Phase 1 in diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin resistance (IR). Our DRC spans departments and
across campus borders to promote research aimed at improving the metabolic health of the people of Hawaiʻi
and the Pacific region. The Center has been built upon the strengths of Hawaiʻi’s spirit of collaboration, intrinsic
ethnic and cultural diversity, and existing strengths in diabetes research. In the US, approximately 11.3% of the
population has diabetes and 38.0% are prediabetic. Diabetes is more prevalent among racial/ethnic minority
populations particularly in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders: 27.7% and Asian: 19.3% compared to White:
12.2% in 2022. The Center will leverage Hawaiʻi’s ability to link basic science mechanisms underlying diabetes
through translational research. In Phase 1, the COBRE-Diabetes was focused on understanding the etiology of
DM and transitioned into studying diabetic complications. In Phase 2, our emphasis will be on DM complications
since these occur at higher rates in minorities than non-Hispanic whites. Racial and ethnic disparities in Hawaiʻi
have been observed in DM complications. Thus, the research projects proposed include: developing minimally
invasive sweat sensors for clinical complications, exploring the genomics of diabetes and stroke in Native
Hawaiians, and understanding the etiology of diabetic autonomic neuropathy in a rodent animal model. The
Research Projects Leaders (RPLs) will be supported by the Administrative and Mentoring and Metabolic and
Analytic Cores. Pilot projects are also proposed to fund two projects a year so that when RPLs graduate there
will be new RPLs in the pipeline. The school of medicine and UHM will also recruit 4 new tenure-track Assistant
Professors whose research complements and focuses on translational DM and IR. Community engagement will
include an annual symposium with a science track and a community track with opportunities for researchers,
academics, clincians and community members to attend and network with those who are working in the field of
diabetes health research and health care disparities AND increased presence on our website and social media
platforms. The Phase 2 overall goals are to: 1) Expand the multi-disciplinary research capacity of the DRC
through the mentoring of new Research Project Leaders, 2) Strengthen the center through promoting
scientific and community interactions, continued development of DRC faculty, and the recruitment of 4
new faculty to the center, and 3) Enhance the research infrastructure of the DRC and the institution
through the expansion of the Metabolic and Analytic Core. Our DRC goal is to develop a translational
research environment to advance DM research in a collaborative environment. This should lead us to
become a strong, self-sustaining Center that will be supported by institutional and peer-reviewed grant
funding."
10847852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The most profound demographic change confronting our world is a dramatic increase in individuals over
65 years of age, projected to reach over 80 million people in the US and 1.5 billion worldwide by 2050. The
increasing number of older adults has major socioeconomic ramifications. First, the increase in longevity
dramatically increases numbers of older adults with multiple chronic diseases and with reduced quality of life.
Second, the challenge of managing the health care of older adults consumes a disproportionally large segment
of health care dollars. Therefore, biomedical innovations must target increasing resilience and healthspan in
older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly illuminated the heightened risk of viral infection in the elderly.
Robust and expanded training in biomedical sciences pertinent to the biology of aging is critical to address the
needs of the growing number of older adults. Our T32 renewal application is a multidisciplinary program designed
to train pre-doctoral investigators (6 per year) to define mechanisms underlying the roles of Infection and
Inflammation as Drivers of Aging (IIDA). The IIDA training program is comprised of basic scientists, clinicians,
and public health mentors at the University of Arizona (UArizona), a top 20 public Research I University,
recognized for its training history in the field of basic biomedical research and for its commitment to mentoring,
diversity (designated Hispanic-Serving Institution) and cross-disciplinary training. To address the complex
challenges of aging, we propose a graduate-level training program with 3 major synergistic themes: (i)
inflammation and immunity in aging, (ii) persistent infection in aging, and (iii) inflammation and age-related
pathology. The 27 NIH-funded faculty supporting this training program have expertise in infection, inflammation,
immunology, and age-related pathologies. The training program is supported by a number of UArizona strengths
in aging, basic sciences, clinical practice, and public health. The goal of the IIDA is to harness these strengths
to train the next generation in the underserved area of infection and inflammation as drivers of the aging process.
Extensive institutional support, state-of-the-art core facilities, and clinical and public health mentorship will
enhance the training experience. IIDA trainees will be exposed to cutting-edge, innovative science through the
participation in colloquia, seminars, data blitzes, and journal clubs, as well as through their engagement with the
EAB, the training faculty, and distinguished scientists in the aging field. IIDA also provides unique opportunities
to students to develop professional skills in advocacy and networking. IIDA also has a robust underrepresented
population (URP) outreach plan and diversity-building component. IIDA program provides exceptional training
for the next generation of diverse scientists to advance our understanding of the biological basis of aging
processes and develop strategies to enhance resilience and healthspan."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer that causes an overabundance of malignant, terminally
developed B cells in the bone marrow. The result of MM patients is improving dramatically because to amazing
advancements in innovative medications such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, and
immunological treatment. Unfortunately, racial inequities persist; African Americans have a higher death rate
than Whites and have not achieved the same survival gains over time. One possible explanation for this
conundrum is the concept of MM stem-like cells (MMSCs). ALDH is a class of NAD (P)-dependent intracellular
enzymes involved in retinoic acid metabolism whose activity is elevated in MMSCs. In MM patients, ALDH
overexpression is related with chemo-resistance, clonogenic potential, and a poor prognosis. Furthermore,
ALDH shields MMSCs against the toxicity of chemotherapeutic medicines. We anticipate that regulating the
ALDH pathway would be a viable technique for combating relapse and refraction in MM. Recently, we created
the isatin-based small molecule inhibitor KS100, which targets many ALDH isoforms. The rationale for this
project is to evaluate the ALDH isoforms responsible for the clonogenic potential and stem-like properties of
MMSCs, determine whether KS100 effectively kills ALDH overexpressing MMSCs, and whether this multi-
isoform ALDH inhibitor could be combined with a traditional proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) to more
effectively treat MM. To achieve this purpose, we propose the following Specific Aims. Aim 1, Determine the
effect of ALDH inhibition on bortezomib resistance in a MM xenograft model. We intend to look into the
influence of nano-KS100 (a liposomal version of KS100) on the growth and stemness of MM tumors. To
evaluate the preclinical potential of nano-KS100, we will employ the NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma null (NSG)
mouse model. We will investigate if nano-KS100 could be utilized in combination with bortezomib because
combination regimens are an important aspect of MM treatment. Aim2, Determine the role of ALDH
isoforms in maintaining the resistance and stemness of MMSCs. We will investigate the role of ALDH
isoforms (ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and ALDH 3A1) in the aggressive phenotype of MMSCs. We will overexpress
specific ALDH isoforms and study their impact on resistance and stemness. Finally, we will determine the
extent to which KS100 affects the MMSC phenotype. These noteworthy discoveries would illustrate the
usefulness of targeting ALDH enzymes in MM and other malignancies for regulating relapse, providing the
requisite preclinical confirmation for clinical translation. This contribution will be significant since it is expected
to have broad translational significance in the treatment of MM. Furthermore, this project will strengthen the
research and education infrastructure at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU), providing
underserved minority students with biochemical and biomedical research experiences that they would not have
otherwise."

C. difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial bacterial infection in the United States, accounting
for more than 1.5 billion dollars in annual healthcare expenditures in this country. The most common and
resource intensive treatment gap in CDI is disease persistence and recurrence, which together occurs in 15-
30% of patients following a first course of antibiotic therapy. Recent evidence suggests a role for cooperative
transkingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria in this disease. Dr. Lamendella has produced most of
these data in microbiome studies from mice and humans. Mice pre-colonized with Candida glabrata
experienced greater severity and lethality of CDI. Dr. Lamendella has led three different, published human
studies which revealed strong enrichment of fungal taxa, especially C. glabrata, among CDI patients, while
patients of comparable age, gender, chronic comorbidities, and antibiotic exposure with C. difficile negative
diarrhea lack this fungal enrichment. With comparable antibiotic exposure between our cohorts, this fungal
enrichment is not an antibiotic epiphenomenon, but rather it represents a previously unrecognized component
of CDI that influences disease severity while serving as a promising, previously unappreciated therapeutic
target. The central hypothesis of this work is that C. glabrata and C. difficile have interspecies
interactions through metabolic and signaling pathways that affect CDI severity and outcome. We will
use CDI+ and CDI- human stool to identify key metabolic pathways and interactions between C. glabrata and
C. difficile to further describe the role of fungi in CDI pathogenesis. We will perform matched metagenomic
(MG) and metatranscriptomic (MT) studies of >500 human stools linked with deidentified clinical and
immunological metadata, obtained from three collaborating university hospitals to identify how C. glabrata
influences CDI through mechanisms including nutrient competition, modulation of the immune response,
quorum sensing, and biofilm formation. Dr. Lamendella will lead a team of student researchers, with a
particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented students, who will leverage high-thoughput sequencing,
bioinformatics analyses, and machine learning models to discover the functional underpinnings of fungi’s role
in CDI. Our first aim will validate our preliminary observations that fungi (especially C. glabrata) directly or
indirectly exacerbate CDI. This aim will establish the prevalence and differential activity of C. glabrata in CDI.
These data are integral to determining the differential metabolic pathways and will enable multivariate
associations with CDI status, clinical metadata, immune markers, and microbial meta-omics features. The
second aim of this proposal will validate features of C. glabrata that are predictive of CDI using genome-scale
metabolic models. Machine learning will be used to extract relevant features that best distinguish CDI. The
long-term goal is to further develop the novel concept, first described by Dr. Lamendella’s team, that fungi have
a role in CDI and are a promising therapeutic target for this disease."

This proposal aims to secure funding for acquiring a new generation EchoMRI whole body
composition analyzer to address the urgent need for reliable and advanced research capabilities
that are critical to ensure uninterrupted progress and advance of federally funded projects at
OHSU. The new EchoMRI analyzer is capable of accurate measurements of whole-body
composition in small live animals, which is crucial for investigating metabolic disorders, monitoring
chronic disease progression and understanding disease mechanisms over time, especially in
young animals and during early development. The instrument currently available for OHSU
researchers is 16 years old, obsolete in both hardware and software, plagued by frequent and
unpredictable malfunctions, dwindling manufacturer support, and incompatible to upgrading. Its
increasingly frequent breakdowns have caused significant disruptions, delays and data loss in
NIH-funded studies. The requested new analyzer, with the latest versions of hardware and
software and enhanced capabilities,will not only solve the problemof unpredictableunavailability,
but will also offer expanded test modalities, new measurement capabilities, improved
measurement accuracy and enhanced data safety. It will be procured from the same vendor of
the instrument currently used at OHSU, EchoMRI LLC, which can ensure a seamless transition.
The new analyzer will cost $136,650 and will be managed by the OHSU University Shared
Resources (USR) program, providing access to at least nine NIH-funded research groups and
other OHSU affiliated institutions. With an optimized operation and management team in place,
acquisition of the new EchoMRI analyzer will empower researchers, facilitate breakthrough
discoveries, and contribute to solving critical health issues through investigations on metabolic
and endocrinological pathogenesis and pathophysiologic mechanisms of a broad range of chronic
diseases, of which comprehensive body composition analysis is often an indispensable and
critical part. This proposed investment holds great potential for transformative impacts on
research outcomes and the advancement of excellence in biomedical research."

The human genome is precisely folded into various structures, which provides the context for functional
processes in the nucleus. Recent advances have indicated the presence of chromatin compartments, CTCF
loops, and small gene-loops as prevalent features of genome organization. Our investigations at high resolution
reveal the presence of sub-genic discordant compartments, placing the 5’ and 3’ ends of many genes in opposite
compartment states. These, along with gene-loops, are highly correlated with transcription elongation status, but
how transcription influences these sub-genic structures is unknown. Additionally, the spatial location of these
features is an important aspect of genome organization that is largely ignored, and which of these features are
dependent on radial location is unclear. The goals of our research are to determine the relationship between
transcription and sub-genic scale chromatin organization and to elucidate the impact of spatial location on
chromatin folding. We will accomplish these goals in programs that use (1) basic mechanistic interrogation to
track how sub-genic structures change as transcription progresses, (2) software development for increased
sensitivity and quantitative fidelity in fine-scale compartment analysis, and (3) investigative genomics to enrich
for peripheral interactions and define the relationship between chromatin contacts and radial position. The results
of this research will resolve mechanistic questions surrounding transcription and gene folding, provide new sorely
needed and cost-saving tools for fine-scale analysis, and identify spatially dependent chromatin organization."

The number one complaint given by the elderly is not pain and discomfort, but rather the need for independence
as a part of their quality of life. Independence and health are ultimately tied to disease progression and elderly
resilience, which may be related to the ability to be stress resistant and to recover following disease onset. The
focus of aging research has now shifted to treating aging as a systemic problem, and determining whether an
increase in lifespan alters the ability for that individual to remain disease free. The hope is that the treatment for
multiple age-related diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and
sarcopenia could be discovered by understanding mechanisms that underlie the basic systemic aging process.
One potentially unexplored mechanism for age-related changes is the alteration of the intestinal microbiome.
Dysbiosis of the microbiome has been associated with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, frailty,
aging, and Alzheimer's disease in human populations and may in fact be associated with the aging process.
Unfortunately, evaluating dysbiosis in aging human populations is confounded by changes in dietary intake,
exposure to pharmaceuticals, and alterations in physical activity. We hypothesize that loss of microbial diversity
is significantly associated with the aging process and seek to evaluate these changes in a nonhuman primate
model, the common marmoset. Further, we hypothesize that oral fecal microbiota transplants may be a potential
therapeutic for stabilizing the aging microbiome and increasing healthspan maintenance. The proposed studies
will evaluate the stability of the microbial diversity and function in aging marmosets, and the associated changes
in measures of health. Fecal microbiota transplant will be conducted in aged marmosets and longitudinal
assessment of microbial diversity and health will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment as an
intervention for human healthspan."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. and a leading
cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. Men are disproportionately affected, with 2-8 times higher incidence
and mortality rates than women globally, across time periods and all racial and ethnic groups. Despite this
consistent observation, the extent to which sex- (i.e., biologic) and gender-related (i.e., social, behavioral)
factors contribute to disparities in HCC risk and survival are unknown. Further, sex disparities in HCC
incidence have yet to be investigated in patients with cirrhosis – the main at-risk cohort in the U.S. This
application adapts the Warnecke conceptual model to articulate specific sex- and gender-related factors that
have not previously been explored for disparities in HCC. This model is then applied to 3 large multicenter
cohorts of patients with cirrhosis and HCC – all with unique clinical and survey data and stored serum samples.
The central hypothesis that disparities in HCC risk are primarily influenced by sex-related biologic factors,
whereas disparities in HCC survival are driven to a greater extent by gender-related social and behavioral
factors, will be investigated through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the association between sex-
related factors and HCC risk in >4,000 patients with cirrhosis; 2) Quantify the magnitude of the survival
disparity between men and women with HCC; 3) Evaluate the influence of sex- and gender-related factors on
HCC survival. Data from the project aims will be triangulated to inform an intervention to reduce disparities in
HCC. The PI is a clinical researcher and hepatologist at UT Southwestern, with a long-term vision of tackling
cancer health disparities and improving care for patients with HCC. The proposed training plan is integrated
with the research aims and builds on her existing knowledge in clinical research and epidemiology. She has
assembled an exceptionally talented interdisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise: Dr. Amit
Singal, experienced health services researcher and content expert in HCC; Dr. Carolyn Mazure, internationally
recognized expert in the study of the influence of sex and gender on health; Dr. Katherine McGlynn,
epidemiologist with expertise in sex hormones in cancer; and Dr. Jasmin Tiro, behavioral scientist with
expertise in mixed methods research. The PI will acquire new, advanced skills in understanding the influence
of sex and gender in health, advanced quantitative analyses, mixed methods research, and knowledge
synthesis to inform intervention development. The research studies in this proposal have significant public
health impact as they will fill gaps in our understanding of the influence of sex and gender on HCC disparities
and expand what is known about HCC in women, a population underrepresented in HCC research. This award
and career development plan will provide the PI with the protected time, training, mentorship, and experience
to build an independently funded research career focused on reducing health disparities in patients with liver
disease and HCC."

Despite the widely publicized risks of non-medical opioid use, opioid misuse continues to be a serious health
problem affecting a significant parcel of the population in the United States. While opioid use disorder has been
linked to abnormal risk-related decision making, the causal mechanisms underlying this relationship remain
unclear. Both human and animal studies suggest that aberrant activity in the brain's prefrontal cortex (PFC) may
contribute to the risky choice behavior induced by repeated opioid exposure. Particularly, the prelimbic subregion
(PL) of the PFC has been implicated in both the rewarding effects and the subsequent behavioral changes
induced by opioids. Previous neuroanatomical studies have shown that PL neurons send dense projections to
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region implicated in behavioral motivation and maladaptive opioid seeking.
Additionally, the PL projects densely to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a region involved in
behavioral conflict and the negative emotional aspects of opioid withdrawal. However, how opioids alter the
function of these two distinct PL pathways to elicit risky drug seeking remains unexplored. I will address this
question by using a novel model of opioid-induced risk-taking behavior in which rats will be exposed to a conflict
between seeking opioids and avoiding a fearful stimulus. In Aim 1, I will investigate individual variabilities in risky
decision making and determine which behaviors predict risky choice during a conflict situation. In Aim 2, I will
combine optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques to record the activity of PL neurons that project to
either the NAc (PL-NAc) or the PVT (PL-PVT) during the conflict test. Finally, in Aim 3, I will establish the role of
PL-NAc and PL-PVT projections in opioid-induced risk taking by using optogenetics to either inhibit or excite
these circuits during conflict and characterize the resultant behavior. This project will allow me to uncover the
PFC underpinnings of opioid-induced risky decision making, which may help us to understand how repeated
opioid exposure affects motivated behaviors in humans."

10862878,"Project Summary
Changes in muscle force and stiffness underlie the control of posture and movement. These fundamental abilities
are impaired in almost all movement disorders, including those resulting from stroke, cerebral palsy,
musculoskeletal injury, or pain. Rehabilitation can be framed in terms of re-establishing healthy patterns of
muscle force and stiffness for each patient. Consequently, a fundamental challenge in the fields of biomechanics,
motor control, and physical rehabilitation has long been measuring muscle force and stiffness in health and
disease, yet there are no rigorous methods for doing so noninvasively. Ultrasound shear wave elastography
(SWE) was proposed as a noninvasive tool for measuring stiffness, but we have demonstrated that SWE is
sensitive not only to muscle stiffness but also to force, and that these dependencies vary across muscle types.
While our results call into question conclusions from many previous studies, they also suggest that SWE could
be reimagined as a tool for noninvasively measuring both stiffness and force. The objective of this proposal is to
evaluate this intriguing possibility, which could transform the study of human movement and guide rehabilitation
protocols for numerous motor disorders.
 Our long-term goal is to improve treatments for musculoskeletal disorders associated with changes to muscle
force or stiffness. Our central hypothesis is that muscle stiffness and force can be uniquely determined from
SWE by considering the distinctive structure of muscle. Shear wave propagation is sensitive to changes in
muscle stress (force normalized by cross-sectional area) and stiffness, but it remains unknown if SWE can
independently measure these quantities. Aims 1 and 2 will quantify how stresses from passive lengthening and
active contraction alter shear wave propagation parallel to the direction of muscle fibers, as measured by the
one-dimensional ultrasound arrays currently available in clinics. Studies will be conducted in an animal model
so that SWE measurements can be compared to direct measures of muscle stiffness and stress (Aim 1), before
considering the complexities of several human muscles thought to have internal variations in stress (Aim 2).
Finally, we will evaluate the novel technique we have developed that uses multi-directional SWE to determine
muscle stress and stiffness noninvasively (Aim 3); this will occur using a combination of 3D-printed biomaterials
with known mechanical properties, muscles harvested from our animal model, and human experiments to
rigorously test this innovative approach and adapt it as needed to account for the unique structure of muscle.
 We expect that our aims will clarify precisely what is being measured by current applications of SWE to
muscle and determine if a novel approach employing multidirectional SWE can be used to measure muscle force
and stiffness noninvasively. Such an ability would be transformative for rehabilitation, providing quantitative
assessments of the critical properties of muscle that enable human movement or contribute to its impairment."

Approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Among
children with ASD, estimates of overweight and obesity (OW/OB) range from 19% to as high as 55% with the
majority of studies reporting OW/OB rates equal to or greater than typically developing children. OW/OB in
childhood tracks well into adulthood and is associated with negative health and psychosocial consequences.
To date, the most successful treatment for typically developing children with OW/OB is family-based behavioral
treatment (FBT), which delivers weekly group-based treatment to the parent and child separately over a 6-
month period. However, children with ASD are typically excluded from these trials and given their unique
presentation, require a tailored treatment program. FBT programs for parents without their child (Parent-based
treatment [PBT]) are more appropriate for families with a child with ASD and OW/OB, as the functioning and
language levels of the children can impact their ability to directly participate in an intensive group-based
program. Research shows that PBT is noninferior to FBT on child weight loss and is less costly to implement.
Our group has developed and pilot tested a PBT group for children with ASD and OW/OB (called PBT-ASD).
Our pilot data showed that the PBT-ASD program was feasible, acceptable and showed initial efficacy on child
weight loss. This project is the next step in this program of research, and we will recruit 150 youth with OW/OB
and ASD and their parent and randomize them to a 6-month telehealth PBT-ASD or active health education
comparator (HE). We will assess main outcomes in children and parents at five time points; baseline, mid-
treatment (month 3), post-treatment (month 6), 6-month follow-up (month 12) and 12-month follow-up (month
18). The primary aim of this study is to compare the effect of PBT-ASD and HE on the target child’s weight
(BMIz/%BMIp95) over the 18 months of the study. The secondary aim is to determine the extent to which the
PBT-ASD and HE affect parent BMI, parent and child physical activity and dietary intake, child mealtime
behavior, parenting style and self-efficacy. As an exploratory aim, we will evaluate moderators (e.g. parent and
child gender, parent and child age, parent educational level, parent baseline BMI, child baseline BMIz/%BMI
p95, parent executive functioning, parenting, child symptom severity, child adaptive behavior skills) and
mediators (e.g. parenting, child symptom severity) of the PBT-ASD and the HE treatment on child BMIz/%BMI
p95 over time. This program of research could advance the standard of practice for children with ASD, and
could result in a tailored intervention for children with both ASD and OW/OB. We believe that by working with
parents using a telehealth model, we can potentially provide an effective and durable treatment, which can
easily be disseminated to parents with children with both ASD and OW/OB."

Pathogenic picornaviruses and bunyaviruses have an enormous impact on public health worldwide, and our
understanding of mechanistic correlates of immunity for members of these virus families is limited. Because of
the diversity of viruses in these families, it is unlikely medical countermeasures (such as vaccines and antibodies)
can be developed ahead of time for each one of these viruses, therefore a prototype pathogens approach is
warranted. We have assembled a highly interdisciplinary consortium of leading investigators in the field of
picornavirus and bunyavirus virology, immunology, vaccine biology and antibody sciences to study the
mechanistic correlates of immunity to prototype pathogens for these families, and then apply the principles we
learn with the prototype pathogens to different pathogenic viruses in those families that are antigenically distinct.
All five Research Projects (RP) in the Center focus on developing strategies effective against all pathogenic
members of a group of viruses, picornaviruses, hantaviruses, and diverse arenaviruses. RP1 focuses on
innovative vaccine strategies for picornaviruses (enterovirus D68, enterovirus A71, echovirus 11 and rhinovirus
C types), RP2 focuses on human anti-picornavirus monoclonal antibodies, RP3 focuses on novel vaccine
candidates for hantaviruses, RP4 focuses on human mAbs for Sin Nombre, Andes and Hantaan hantaviruses,
and RP5 proposes studies on arenavirus vaccines and antibodies, with LCMV as an initial prototype for study.
A unique aspect of this Center is that it includes full complementary research projects for both vaccine and mAbs,
which are the two most well-studied countermeasures that provide complete pre- or post-exposure protection
against virus infections. The advanced level of certain preliminary findings in the work described in the RPs is a
major strength and advantage of our Center. There has relatively little significant progress over the last decade
in the development of vaccines or postexposure therapies for picornaviruses or bunyaviruses. Preventive
vaccines would have utility for the public during local or large-scale outbreaks, for laboratory workers, for first
responders or individuals at high-risk exposure, and for certain travelers or military personnel. In the case of a
biological attack or natural outbreak, however, a preventative or postexposure antibody treatment would be the
most practical approach for rapid deployment and has the advantage that antibodies can be used in any age or
health condition, including the immunocompromised. perform pivotal studies that will facilitate the development
of products used for the prevention and treatment of Nipah and Hendra infections. The cooperation among the
paired vaccine + mAb RPs, the Administrative Core, the sample acquisition, structural biology, and vaccine
technology cores is built into the Center by design, as all components work together to provide broadly effective
candidate countermeasures. Quality system data management will be employed in both the preparation of
advanced stage test articles and in the conduct of animal studies."

10860308,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Leptospirosis, an emerging infectious disease, is a leading zoonotic cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
conveying the greatest burden to subsistence farmers and urban slum populations. In the US and other
industrialized countries, there is increasing awareness of leptospirosis as the cause of disease among inner-city
populations, military personnel, and individuals engaged in swimming and water sports. Leptospirosis is an
environmentally transmitted disease caused by spirochetes belonging to forty-one pathogenic species (P1 and
P2) of the genus Leptospira. Leptospirosis causes life-threatening disease in humans and domestic animals and
has a major economic impact on livestock animals worldwide. To date, there is no effective prevention and control
for leptospirosis. The major challenge has been developing a vaccine that protects against all the genetically
diverse pathogenic species and >300 serovars which are potential agents for leptospirosis. All attempts to identify
leptospiral vaccine candidates that can be used as a widely-applicable vaccine has failed. This crucial knowledge
gap has hampered the development of an effective universal vaccine that can provide synergistic health and
societal benefits by preventing transmission and disease in domestic animals and the risk of spill-over infections
in humans. Our work has been focused on closing those gaps. Recently, we evaluated a motility-deficient mutant
strain of Leptospira and found that immunization with this attenuated strain conferred cross-protective immunity in
experimental animals, with antibodies against proteins being immune-correlates for this cross-protection.
Furthermore, a multi-recombinant protein construct based on four targets identified from our attenuated-vaccine
model elicited cross-protection against death and renal colonization. In this proposal, we hypothesize that our
multi-recombinant protein candidate induces a strong humoral immune response that correlates with cross-
protection on multiple animal models. Further, we hypothesize that this cross-protection is determined by a strong
immune response against specific B-cell epitopes conserved among pathogenic species of Leptospira spp. We
will vaccinate hamsters, mice and rats and determine the efficacy of out recombinant-protein construct to elicit
cross-protection for death and/or renal colonization, and characterize their immunogenicity based on B and T cell
responses. We will then apply a high throughput, random bacterial peptide display technology and a cryo-EM-
based approach to identify epitope binding specificities with single amino acid resolution. Those epitopes will be
then validated and selected based on their immunogenicity and cross-protective characteristics among different
strains of pathogenic Leptospira spp. to establish a universal multi-epitope construct against leptospirosis. The
results obtained by the characterization of our multi-recombinant protein vaccine would expand the work to
confirm that a universal vaccine against leptospirosis is feasible. We expect to identify a potential generalizable
candidate for leptospirosis, which can be advanced for process development and clinical trials for human and
veterinary use, yielding new intervention strategies for this important yet neglected infectious disease problem."

The widespread misuse of prescription opioids, opioid addiction, and overdose has underscored the urgent need
to develop effective, non-addicting medications to treat chronic pain, a leading cause of insomnia. Agonists at
the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor (NOPR) have shown promise as modulators of the antinociceptive
and rewarding effects of opioids. We have found that two different NOPR agonists potently induced sleep and
increased EEG delta power in rats, mice, and non-human primates, suggesting that the N/OFQ-NOPR system
may have a previously unrecognized role in sleep/wake regulation. Since our studies used synthetic compounds,
the hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that the N/OFQ-NOPR system is a component of the
endogenous sleep/wake regulatory system. First, we will evaluate whether disruption of endogenous NOPR
tone affects the regulation of activity, sleep/wake and/or body temperature (Tb) using a novel, inducible NOPR
(iNOPR) KO mouse strain in which NOPR can be deleted throughout the brain by systemic administration of
tamoxifen. We will expand on our initial results which indicate that, not only do iNOPR KO mice fail to respond
to NOPR agonism by increasing NREM sleep, they exhibit a partial insomnia under baseline conditions with
longer wake bouts during the major sleep period. We will then begin to establish the neuroanatomical foundation
for the phenotypes identified in the global deletion study and for subsequent circuit-based studies by determining
the chemotypes of neurons activated by NOPR agonism. First, we will determine NOPR expression in neuronal
populations known to be involved in sleep/wake control. Global assessment of NOP agonist-induced c-Fos
expression showed that two of 316 brain areas stood out as having increased Fos expression: the lateral
habenula (LHb) and the anterodorsal preoptic and adjacent parastrial (ADP/PS) nuclei. We will follow up by
obtaining a global view on NOP agonist-induced Fos expression in Oprl1 KI-eGFP and Pnoc-IRES-Cre
(Prepronociceptin-IRES-Cre) mice and use other genetic markers to further characterize and quantify the Fos+
neurons. Next, we will determine whether local NOPR deletion affects activity, sleep/wake and/or Tb by injecting
a Cre-dependent virus into candidate brain regions in NOPRlox/lox mice, particularly focusing on the LHb and
ADP/PS nuclei. We will then chemogenetically activate glutamatergic and NOPR+ neurons in the LHb to
determine whether these cells affect activity, sleep/wake and/or Tb and use the Fos-TRAP method to
chemogenetically reactivate LHb and ADP/PS neurons labelled after NOPR agonist treatment. The information
obtained will further our understanding of the role of the N/OFQ – NOP system in sleep/wake control and enable
us to develop a circuit-based model to understand the effects on NOPR agonism on sleep/wake physiology."

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is the deadliest form of colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC)
metastasis, with a median survival of 10-18 months for CRC and less than this for GC. PC is a common form of
metastasis in both CRC and GC, each with an incidence of between 10 and 50%. Unfortunately, there are few
treatments available, and there exist large regional and ethnic disparities in each of these diseases, emphasizing
the need for increased research on developing improved therapies. This development is slowed by the absence
of appropriate in vitro models and the gaps in our knowledge of how metastasis occurs. Our application is
focused on improving this situation. Here we propose to characterize and utilize a recently-developed in vitro PC
model (the Vascularized Micro-Peritoneum, VMP) for use as a therapeutic development tool. The model is based
on our vascularized micro-tumor (VMT) platform, a microphysiological system (MPS) that allows direct
observation of living cells that are proliferating, metabolizing, migrating, and dying in a complex 3D environment.
This application is in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-22-099 titled “Cancer Tissue
Engineering Collaborative: Enabling Biomimetic Tissue-Engineered Technologies for Cancer Research”, the
stated goal of which is to “support the development and characterization of state-of-the-art biomimetic tissue-
engineered technologies for cancer research.” In general, systemically-delivered drugs have not been
especially effective against PC as much of the early growth occurs on the surface of the peritoneum, somewhat
distant from the underlying blood vessels and so hard to target with high doses of drug. Most patients now
receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal
chemoperfusion (HIPEC), which has resulted in a general increase in patient survival. Despite this
improvement, most patients still develop recurrent disease in less than a year and the majority die due to
disease by 5 years. Hence there is a huge unmet need for new and improved therapies for patients with PC,
and repurposing drugs approved for other cancers might be a promising approach.
Our hypothesis is that: A microphysiological system platform can be used to help identify improved
therapies for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
To test this hypothesis we will pursue the following aims:
1. Characterize a dual-tissue platform that models peritoneal carcinomatosis
2. Correlate platform performance to in vivo data in a prospective Clinical Study
3. Test drug sensitivities of PC tumors in the VMT/VMP"

efforts to establishing a robust Natural History Study along with efforts to identify biomarkers to enhance our
understanding of the disease. In this project, we will leverage our complementary expertise to define a catalog
of biomarkers to facilitate future clinical trials. The biomarkers that we will characterize will ultimately provide
information on disease progression, prognosis, are associated with commonly affected pathways in NPC and
will predict therapeutic response. Towards this goal, we will 1) prioritize and validate biomarkers that reflect
neuropathological alterations, 2) identify and characterize proximal biomarkers of NPC1 then 3) investigate
multiple biomarkers, representing different aspects of NPC1 neuropathology, to provide prognostic information
that can be used in parental counseling and to stratify this heterogeneous disorder for therapeutic trials. Our
research team’s extensive discovery efforts have revealed twelve candidate markers. Within the scope of this
project is our short-term goal to evaluate these markers in a larger cohort of biospecimens using custom
developed and easily transferrable methods. Our long-term goal is to utilize these biomarkers as indicators of
response in future clinical trials."

 Fluorination of an organic compound affects physicochemical properties, which in medicinal settings perturbs
pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, distribution, and/or metabolic profiles both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the
ability to selectively install fluorinated groups under mild conditions is essential for accessing new therapeutics
and biological probes. However, the unique physical properties of fluorinated substrates and/or reagents typically
perturb fundamental organic reactivities, which can complicate synthetic sequences to access fluorinated
compounds. Thus, many routine organic reactions simply do not work in the presence of fluorinated reagents or
with fluorinated substrates. Additionally, the unique properties of fluorinated substrates enable new reactivities
that cannot be achieved by the respective non-fluorinated counterparts, which provides opportunities to develop
innovative reactions and strategies for accessing medicinally relevant substructures
 With this R35 program, the Altman group has a long-term goal of developing innovative catalyst systems,
reagents, and/or synthetic strategies for accessing medicinally relevant fluorinated substructures. In this area,
we develop fluorination and fluoroalkylation methodologies using innovative strategies (e.g. electrochemistry, C–
H functionalization, deoxyfluoroalkylation, transition metal catalyzed reactions) that enable synthetic chemists to
convert simple and readily available functional groups (e.g. alcohols, carbonyls, fluorinated alkenes) into a broad
spectrum of highly valuable fluorinated analogs. Additionally, we explore synthetic transformations in which
fluorinated substructures react through distinct mechanisms and/or deliver products with distinct selectivities
relative to analogous reactions of nonfluorinated substrates. Development of the proposed strategies will enable
medicinal chemists to access new and unique biological probes and therapeutics. A second long-term goal is to
explore physicochemical perturbations imparted by fluorinated substructures that might influence drug stability,
distribution, metabolism, and/or ligand-protein interactions, and to apply such principles in the design of next-
generation fluorinated therapeutic candidates with improved drug-like properties. In the next phase of our work,
we will apply modern innovative synthetic reactions to deliver next-generation fluorinated analogs of natural
products that will retain the therapeutically valuable pharmacodynamic action and also improve stability and

This is a renewal of an NIBIB Graduate Training Program in Multi-Scale Analysis of Biological Structure
and Function at the University of California San Diego. Its goal is to train a new cadre of scientists who can
cross disciplinary boundaries to solve important biomedical problems that span scales of biological
organization from molecule to organism. Pre-doctoral trainees are drawn exclusively from a formal
Interdisciplinary Ph.D. specialization in Multi-Scale Biology (the “Interfaces Graduate Training Program”),
which includes students from 9 highly ranked participating home Ph.D. programs (Bioengineering, Biological
Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,
Neurosciences, Materials Science & Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Nanoengineering). Students
apply at the end of their first year of graduate studies. This T32 program brings together 39 interdisciplinary
training faculty from 14 departments. Since its inception, 48 predoctoral trainees on this T32 have graduated,
including 8 from Biological Sciences, 20 from Engineering departments, 8 from Health Sciences and 12 from
the Physical Sciences. In the four years of the current renewal has supported 18 trainees from the Health
Sciences (11%), Engineering (64%), and Physical Sciences (25%). In the current renewal URM trainees have
increased to 39% from 29% at the last renewal.
 A central feature of the training curriculum is seven hands-on graduate laboratory courses that
introduce students to advanced techniques for measuring and analyzing living systems at scales of biological
organization spanning from molecule to whole organism. Students use state-of-the-art facilities and
technologies from mass spectrometry to live cell microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Computational
labs cover multiscale modeling, neurodynamics and data sciences. The scientific focus on multi-scale analysis
of biological structure and function reflects a fundamental challenge of modern biomedical science in
developing and applying novel quantitative approaches from the physical, engineering, biological and health
sciences to integrative problems in biomedicine. Regular program activities, including bi-weekly graduate
seminars, annual symposia and retreats, course open houses and quarterly program meetings, promote
interactions between students and faculty from different disciplines. The dual-mentored training program is
successful in promoting new interdisciplinary collaborations in important areas including developmental biology,
neuroscience and cancer, cardiovascular disease, diagnostics and drug discovery. This renewal application
proposes to continue to train the most diverse student body to be effective leaders in structurally integrated
multi-scale analysis of biological function. It will include formal instruction in Rigor and Reproducibility, create
an expanded Alumni Mentor Network for trainees and a structured co-mentored interdisciplinary research
rotation for all prospective students."
10849196,"The purpose of this proposed renewal is to continue training postdoctoral (MD, MD/PhD, and PhD) fellows for
careers as independent researchers. Since its inception in 1978, the program described in this application has
successfully prepared individuals for careers in Mood and Anxiety Disorder research, evolving over the course
of nearly half a century to continue training investigators who will have a significant impact in their fields. The
success of our program is measured by how many fellows continue in a research-intensive trajectory whether
supported by a K award, other sources of funding, or other positions that advance the research enterprise. The
program itself is an intensive three-year program where fellows learn to identify key research questions, formulate
hypotheses, and design and execute experiments that test those hypotheses. Other skills required for a fellow
to become an independent researcher include understanding the administration of a successful research
enterprise, effective collaboration and writing grants. Comprehensive training in the Responsible Conduct of
Research begins early in the fellowship. Our fellows our taught to maintain the highest standards of scientific
integrity and understand the ethical issues relevant to human and animal research.
In this renewal application we are seeking five years of funding for 6 fellows per year. Fellows are carefully
selected for particular interest in clinically relevant research interests and screened by our committee for their
potential to benefit from our program and succeed as independent investigators. Admitted fellows are paired
with a primary mentor in one of several areas of focus. These include amongst others, mouse models of neural
circuit function and dysfunction relevant to mood and anxiety, functional neuroimaging, theoretical approaches
for understanding circuit function and dysfunction that is relevant to cognition, emotion and psychiatric illness,
and neurodevelopmental perspectives on the abovementioned areas. The fellows are exposed to a training
program that provides ‘wrap around’ mentoring, support and didactics well beyond what is usually encountered
in a post-doctoral position. This includes ‘meta’ mentorship from the program and training directors who help
trainees to become more effective mentees and who work with mentors to ensure that they are meeting their
trainees needs. The program provides didactics in research design, statistics, responsible conduct of research
and grant writing to all fellows, with additional coursework tailored to individual fellows needs. Through a bi-
annual review with the fellows or their independent development plans, the directors ensure that trainees are on
track to meet their goals in submitting scientific papers for publication and in generating data for future grant
submissions. New directions include the expansion of the fellow seminar program to include presentations by
fellows in all three years, providing an opportunity to give stage appropriate presentations of their work and
receive feedback. This seminar program has the additional advantage of providing a larger community of
research minded individuals interested in a broad range of mental health research areas."
10860406,"Project Abstract:
Phrenic Neuropathy, a condition that impairs diaphragm muscle function, often leads to serious
respiratory problems and requires mechanical ventilation. Our research proposal aims to enhance
recovery from this condition through a novel Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation protocol, in
conjunction with a custom-made, wireless, bioresorbable implant. Informed by a rising incidence
of Phrenic Neuropathy due to complications from severe COVID-19 and greater diagnostic
capabilities and other factors, this proposal is the result of collaboration among a multidisciplinary
team with substantial expertise in all aspects of this proposed work. In general, there is a common
misconception that recovery from peripheral axon injury is usually good, due to the fact there is
some spontaneous axon regeneration, but this does not match the reality that recovery is actually
slow and incomplete for approximately 90% of patients. This is also true for patients with Phrenic
Neuropathy. Our data and others show that 68-96% of these patients have incomplete or no
functional recovery of the diaphragm muscle. Despite varying causes of Phrenic Neuropathy, its
impact on respiratory function and individual quality of life is significant. At its worst, people with
Phrenic Neuropathy may require mechanical ventilation, but more typically they are severely
limited in their ability to engage in routine exertion required for activities of daily life. Currently,
clinical and surgical approaches do not sufficiently address the issue of slow axon regrowth.
 Our project aims to rectify this by developing a Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation protocol
that can restore diaphragm muscle innervation and function faster and more completely than ever
before. Briefly, our approach is focused on three specific aims: 1) determining if repeated
Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation sessions are more effective than a single session, 2) assessing
if repeated sessions enhance brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB signaling more than a single
session or control, and 3) establishing how essential brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB
signaling is to the effects of Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation treatment. We aim to deliver a new
therapeutic electrical stimulation paradigm to accelerate diaphragm muscle innervation and
improve functional outcomes after Phrenic Neuropathy, providing new insights into the underlying
mechanism of how brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB signaling can enhance muscle
reinnervation. The prior success of clinical translation from rat model to human clinical trials for
Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation to treat other nerve injuries implies a great opportunity to move
quickly towards clinical translation upon the successful completion of these aims."
10830918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A comprehensive understanding of bacterial pathogenesis not only requires a detailed knowledge of the
genome and proteome, but also the peptidome elaborated during the progression of infection. The overall
objective of this proposal is to build upon our exciting preliminary observations describing the identification of
endogenous microproteins and peptides detected in cell-free supernatants of community-associated (CA)
MRSA cultures. Within this group we identified two novel microproteins originating from an unannotated locus
in the CA-MRSA TCH1516 genome. We found that these microproteins, termed S. aureus microprotein 1
(SAM1) and S. aureus microprotein 2 (SAM2), are highly conserved among Staphylococci and are regulated
by the classical accessory gene regulatory system. We have started to characterize these factors, showing that
SAM1 appears to act as a canonical cytolysin. Intriguingly, SAM2 possesses unique bioactivity, the
perturbation of keratin networks that promotes an in vivo switch from a localized S. aureus skin infection to an
invasive dissemination to the underlying tissues. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SAMs
significantly contribute to CA-MRSA’s ability to cause disease in a host. In Aim 1, we will dissect the
pathogenic contributions of SAM1 as a functional cytolysin in vitro and in vivo. Given the bioactivity of SAM1 is
inhibited by serum lipoproteins, we will focus on its role once CA-MRSA is in an intracellular environment. Our
strong preliminary data suggests SAM1 selectively binds to prohibitins (PHBs) across differential host cell
types. Thus, we will take the study of CA-MRSA cytolysins in a new direction by dissecting the potential role of
PHBs as targets of SAM1. In Aim 2, we will perform a structure and function analysis of the interaction
between SAM2 and keratin. Our data shows that this interaction has an important in vivo consequence during
the shift from a local to invasive infection type. By a powerful combination of microbiology and multi-omic
approaches, we will define the SAM2 structural contact points required for pathogenesis and will detail host
pathways that are impacted by SAM2 during the invasive switch. In Aim 3, to assess the broader significance
of our discovery, we will determine the pathogenic roles SAMs play in a diverse library of CA-MRSA strains, in
addition to other Staphylococcal pathogens that express bioactive SAM homologs. Aim 3 is critical given that
the importance of SAMs in other Staphylococci beyond CA-MRSA TCH1516 remains unknown. This proposal
is highly innovative because it departs from the current focus of investigating host-pathogen interactions
through the more established genomic and proteomic workflows. The proposed work is highly significant given
it can drive the development of anti-Staphylococcal therapies based on a relatively new and largely mysterious
molecular paradigm - the peptidome."
10830919,"ABSTRACT
The transition from paper charts to electronic health records (EHRs), advances in computing
power and storage capacity, and the availability and accessibility of sophisticated machine
learning algorithms have revolutionized the ability for researchers to tap into Big Data and make
use of it to answer all sorts of important clinical questions. However, maximizing the utility of all
of this rich clinical data from EHRs and clinical registries is predicated on the ability for researchers
to accurately identify which patients have specific diseases; to accurately classify conditions
based on their disease severity; to ascertain which patients are improving, stable, or deteriorating;
and to appropriately identify and quantify clinically relevant outcomes. Currently, nearly all
researchers who work with Big Data in ophthalmology rely exclusively on administrative billing
codes to identify common ocular diseases and outcomes of interest. Yet, research has shown
that sole reliance on billing codes is fraught with limitations and does not take full advantage of
the plethora of useful information routinely captured in structured and free-text EHR data. In this
proposal we develop, rigorously test, and validate an innovative approach to permit researchers
to more accurately identify and classify patients with common sight-threatening ocular diseases
and capture transitions from less to more severe disease states and key outcomes of interest.
Based on preliminary studies we performed, we believe our approach to enhanced ocular
phenotype identification is substantially more accurate than exclusive reliance on billing codes. In
Aim 1, we use this approach to EHR data to identify and categorize patients with 3 of the most
common causes of irreversible vision loss—glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular
degeneration. In Aim 2, we extend enhanced phenotype identification by trying to identify novel
forms of these 3 conditions; we will use cluster analysis to identify groups of clinical features
associated with these 3 ocular diseases that co-segregate together. We will also test whether
some of these clusters are associated with better or worse clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we apply
our approach to identify key ocular outcomes in EHR data such as disease stability and
progression from less to more advanced stages for each of the 3 ocular diseases of interest. By
fulfilling the aims of this proposal, we will permit researchers throughout the country and the world
to more accurately identify important ocular diseases and outcomes in EHR and clinical registry
datasets. This will serve as a key building block to permit researchers to incorporate Big Data into
machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, genotype-phenotype association studies,
patient recruitment for clinical trials, and many other clinical and translational research projects."
10831021,"SUMMARY
Cancer cells arise and progress due to accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that contribute to
cancer phenotypes. One potential cause of these alterations are DNA sequences that are “difficult-to-replicate”
(DTR) and act as an endogenous source of replication stress. Across the genome there are two major classes
of mutually overlapping DTR sequences, including mini-satellites and micro-satellites in the centromere regions
and G-quadruplexes (G4s) in the telomeres. Such secondary structures formed in DTRs, if not properly resolved,
may block DNA replication fork movement and lead to genome instability. However, cells have developed
mechanisms to resolve these barriers for efficient and faithful DNA replication. The most well-known way to
resolve G4 and other secondary structures is unwinding the structure through DNA helicases. During the last
funding period, we elucidated that the nuclease/helicase DNA2 facilitates DNA replication at DTR sequences. In
our preliminary studies, we showed that the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2, a component of the MutSα
complex, binds to both G4s and DNA2 and strongly stimulates DNA2 to cleave G4 structures. Radiation,
elimination of DNA2 or MSH2, or lack of histone H1c ubiquitination cause G4 accumulation. Therefore, we
hypothesize that: 1) DNA2 in complex with MutSα excises and repairs G4 structures to facilitate DNA replication
through DTRs; 2) ubiquitinated H1c recruits the DNA2/MutSα complex onto G4-bearing DNA ends at double-
strand breaks (DSBs) for homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) of DSBs; and 3) gene mutations that impair G4
resolution processes sensitize individuals to chemicals that induce or stabilize G4 structures, leading to genome
rearrangements and cancer initiation. We propose to define the important molecular aspects of the G4 excision
pathways during DNA replication or DSB repair. Because G4s are implicated as chromosome structural elements
and epigenetic motifs that regulate gene expression, G4 excision must be tightly controlled. It is important to
elucidate how the DNA2/MutSα is signaled to be recruited to the G4 structure for excision repair. We will define
how H1c ubiquitination mediated by ubiquitin E3 ligases ITCH or RNF8 induces DNA2/MutSα to cleave G4
structures during DNA replication and DSB repair. Moreover, a large number of environmentally contaminating
compounds (ECCs) can specifically bind to G4 structures and alter the dynamics of G4 resolution. We expect
that once genetic mutations impair a G4 resolution pathway, a G4 stabilizer can act synergistically to cause DNA
replication stresses, DSBs, and genome rearrangements. Therefore, we will determine if combined genetic and
environmental factors that inhibit proper G4 resolution/repair show synergy in promoting genome instability and
cancer initiation. Our comprehensive analyses will define the pathway for G4 excision in S phase and during
DNA DSB repair via HDR, and will provide evidence that G4-stabilizing ECCs lower the cancer threshold,
particularly for individuals with defects in DNA2-mediated G4 and other secondary structure resolution pathways."

10830942,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 12% of couples in the United States seek infertility treatment, which for some is associated with
treatment-related side-effects, treatment-related stressors, and a significant financial burden. Although male-
factor infertility contributes to an estimated 30-50% of cases of couple infertility, risk factors, mechanisms, and
potential interventions for male-factor infertility have been critically understudied. Ambient air pollution and
ambient temperature extremes are ubiquitous exposures associated with systemic inflammation and oxidative
stress, to which the process of spermatogenesis may be uniquely susceptible. Research has found exposure
to high levels of air pollution may adversely impact semen quality; however, the effect of exposure during
developmentally-sensitive windows of spermatogenesis on semen quality, impacts on sperm epigenetic factors
including DNA methylation, and the cumulative impact of male partner exposure on infertility treatment
outcomes have been little evaluated. This study will utilize data from the Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation
Trial (FAZST) to estimate impacts of ambient environmental factors on male fertility, adding estimates of
individual exposure to ambient air pollution and temperature. Adding to sparse literature from countries with
low-to-moderate levels of air pollution, this study will evaluate exposure to air pollution and high and low
ambient temperatures during developmentally susceptible windows of spermatogenesis (mitosis, meiosis,
spermiogenesis, and spermiation) with semen quality, leveraging four repeated semen samples from more
than 1,900 participants (Aim 1). Epigenetic alterations in sperm are increasingly recognized as a potential
mechanism impacting male fertility, with exposure to several oxidative stress-inducing and endocrine-
disrupting environmental factors linked to differential DNA methylation in sperm. This study will conduct a novel
assessment of the impact of ambient air pollution exposure on sperm DNA methylation (Aim 2). Finally, this
study will utilize information on outcomes of infertility treatment cycles (in vitro fertilization and intrauterine
insemination cycles) and timing of treatment-related semen samples to evaluate the impact of male partner
exposure to air pollution and ambient temperature during spermatogenesis on probability of pregnancy during
infertility treatment, accounting for exposure windows during embryogenesis and implantation (Aim 3). This
career development award will extend the candidate’s prior training and research experience in environmental
and reproductive epidemiology by providing expert mentoring and targeted training in epigenetics, air quality
exposure assessment, and causal inference. Her primary mentor Dr. Richard Pilsner (epigenetics), along with
members of her mentoring team Dr. Timothy Canty (air quality modeling) and Dr. Laura Balzer (causal
inference), with provide the needed mentoring for the candidate to establish a productive independent research
program. In addition to targeted training, this K01 award will add novel evidence for the impact of ambient air
pollution and temperature on men’s reproductive health and outcomes of infertility treatment."

The proposed adolescent and young adult (AYA) mixed methods project will meet the goals and scientific scope
of the U01 by refining and testing a scalable intervention to mitigate and manage adverse long-term outcomes
in AYA cancer survivors. By improving access to survivorship resources, health literacy, self-management skills
and support, the intervention is designed to improve adherence to AYA healthcare guidelines and reduce cancer-
related distress. The project leverages an existing survivorship informatics infrastructure, an established
multicenter survivorship research network, and our experiences with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
AYAs and a digital and telehealth program initially developed for hematopoietic cell transplant survivors. This
research fills a critical gap in care for AYA survivors by providing a novel, personalized, technology-based self-
management program with stepped care telehealth. To be scalable, it uses a risk-based delivery model targeted
to AYA survivors with demonstrated need. The two-arm RCT will test the AYA-adapted INSPIRE digital program,
including an interactive mobile app/website and social media, adding stepped care telehealth for those with
continued distress, lack of survivorship healthcare literacy, or who are not using the digital program at 1 month.
In the active control arm, survivors receive access to a study website with existing AYA survivor resource links
followed by delayed access to the INSPIRE program. Specific aims are: 1) Among AYA survivors with elevated
cancer-related distress, determine the efficacy of a self-management program, INSPIRE, delivered by interactive
digital cross-device options and stepped care telehealth coaching, compared to the active control arm. 2) Among
AYA survivors with inadequate adherence to healthcare guidelines, determine the efficacy of the INSPIRE digital
and telehealth self-management program in improving overall healthcare adherence and cardiometabolic or
subsequent malignancy surveillance compared to the active control arm. 3) Examine mechanisms associated
with intervention efficacy including engagement with the online program, use of telehealth contacts, and
improved health self-efficacy, health literacy, AYA-specific impact of cancer, and barriers to healthcare; and
examine moderators of intervention engagement or response including cancer clinical factors, health status, and
sociodemographic and environmental factors. 4) Define costs of maintaining and delivering components of the
INSPIRE program if delivered in a scaled-up model of care. An exploratory aim will assess dissemination
potential and define risk models associated with distress, poorer health status or healthcare nonadherence. Aims
will be accomplished with a two-arm, multicenter, risk-stratified RCT of N=980 AYA survivors of leukemia,
lymphoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma, or sarcoma, age 18-39, and 1-5 years post-diagnosis. The primary
outcome is reduced distress at 3 months; secondary outcomes are improved adherence and reduced distress
at 12 months. If effective, the program is positioned for accelerated dissemination/implementation to improve care
for AYA survivors by using a scalable informatics-based administration and largely digital intervention program."
10859228,"Gram-negative (G-) bacteria are leading causes of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). According to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, over 1 million HAIs occur across the health care system every
year in the US, and hospital-acquired HAIs alone are responsible for $28 to $33 billion in potentially preventable
health care expenditures annually. Alarmingly, successful treatment of G- infections has become more and more
challenging, primarily due to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistance (MDR) to existing and even newly
approved antimicrobial agents in these pathogens. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published their lists of priority pathogens and antibiotic resistance
classification in 2017 and 2019, respectively, in which carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB),
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and MDR or carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(CRPA) are among those of the biggest concern, highlighting the urgent need for discovery and developing novel
antibacterial agents for MDR G- infections. To address this need, we have created a new class of antibiotics,
the biamyxins (BMX), which are semisynthetic, dimeric polycationic peptides that tightly bind lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) in the outer membrane of G- pathogens including CRAB, CRPA, and CRE isolates, thus confer the broad-
spectrum G- coverage with potent antimicrobial activity. BMXs are constructed from two identical semisynthetic
polymyxin-derived compounds joined by a central linker. Unlike monomeric polymyxins or recent derivatives, we
designed novel dimeric peptide-like compounds optimized to bind the LPS of both sensitive and COL-resistant
(COL-R) G- pathogens using cooperative binding. This innovative approach engages modern medicinal
chemistry guided structural design to maximize potency while minimizing toxicity of BMX molecules. HCC-0010
is our current lead compound and has demonstrated highly promising properties as a therapeutic agent: broad
spectrum antibacterial activity, low cytotoxicity, acute safety in rodents, in vivo efficacy in mouse models of
septicemia and pneumonia due to multiple G- species including A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and K.
pneumoniae, and a favorable plasma half-life (~5 hours) and efficient target tissue (lung and epithelial lining
fluid) distribution in mice. Further optimization of potency and spectrum and in-depth evaluation of
pharmacological and toxicological properties of this lead are proposed in this application. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to identify a qualified lead development candidate by Year 4 and pursue an Investigational
new drug (IND) candidate through Years 4 and 5, that meets these criteria: 1) acceptable stability, tolerability
and physiochemical properties for IV formulation, 2) MIC90s ≤2 µM against clinical isolates (including MDR) of
Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and E. coli, 3) MIC90s ≤4 µM against MCR-1, MCR-2 and other colistin-
resistant G- clinical isolates, 4) low cytotoxicity with a CC50 >50 µM, 5) robust in vivo therapeutic efficacy against
MDR G- pathogens, 6) PK/PD parameters to support three times daily or less frequent dosing in humans."
10859534,"Summary/Abstract
Kidney transplant (KT) survival faces challenges from increased patient complexity, use of non-standard donors,
and longer cold ischemic times. Despite refinement in immunosuppression (IS) management over several
decades, nearly all KT patients experience progressive loss of allograft function, leading to eventual graft failure
while still risking life-threatening IS-related complications. Development of evidence-based IS management
practice to optimize long-term KT function has been limited by the need for detailed, longitudinal clinical data for
large representative populations. Our previous NIDDK-supported R01 grant (Choosing IS regimens in kidney
Transplant by Efficacy and Morbidity; CISTEM), leveraged integrated transplant registry, Medicare claims and
national pharmacy clearinghouse data to assess the impact of early IS regimen selection on key post-KT events:
infections, malignancy, new onset diabetes, as well as traditional metrics (acute rejection rate, allograft survival
and patient death). We developed a free web-based interface to assist transplant professionals and patients in
shared-decision making about IS choice at the time of KT. However, IS requires lifelong dynamic adjustments.
We will enhance our prior work with the following Specific Aims in CISTEM2: 1) Recognizing the lack of
longitudinal and granular clinical observations and lab results, we will establish a novel CISTEM2 dataset,
integrating: a) national transplant registry data granular clinical data from 12 transplant centers housed in the
Greater Plains Collaborative (GPC,) a component of the Patient Centered Clinical Research Network
(PCORnet); b) administrative claims; and c) social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators for KT recipients.
GPC utilizes the PCORnet common data model (CMD) for all clinical data, which can be securely linked to
national transplant registry, administrative claims and SDOH indicators. We will expand from the multivariable
propensity and Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates used in CISTEM, to more
responsive and clinical meaningful endpoints such as percentage drop in KT function (via estimated glomerular
filtration rate; eGFR) and the validation of computed phenotypes for key clinical events. 2) We will extend
CISTEM by developing longitudinal machine learning (ML) algorithms to dynamically identify IS strategies that
optimize longer-term KT eGFR, reduce cost, and limit those IS comorbidities that post-transplant patient focus
groups identify as contributors to diminished quality of life. 3) We will validate the predictive models refined in
Aim 1 and the ML models developed in Aim 2, using two additional PCORnet sites (12 more KT centers; Total
N: 40,535 KTs). We will analyze PCORnet CDM from all centers using distributed learning models to refine the
first dynamic, evidence based clinical decision tool for longitudinal IS management after KT. Balancing the risk
of acute rejection, patient and graft survival, and risk of IS-related complications after KT, based on highly
granular, multicenter, longitudinal clinical data from real-world patient experience, will allow patients and
physicians to dynamically optimize IS in a more personalized, patient focused, and cost-effective manner."
10859580,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize Factor XII (FXII) functions in sickle cell disease (SCD) and
their contribution to venous thrombosis (VT), vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and end-organ injury. SCD is a
hematologic disorder caused by a single nucleotide mutation of the β-globin gene. Hypoxia-induced sickling of
red blood cells (RBCs) results in painful recurrent VOC, hemolytic anemia and cumulatively, in multi-organ
damage. A chronic hypercoagulable state with increased risk of venous thrombosis contributes to increased
morbidity and mortality among patients with SCD. New targeted anticoagulant therapies are still associated with
increased rates of bleeding.
We previously demonstrated that FXII contributes to the development of VT through both its enzymatic (FXIIa)
functions as well as the thromboinflammatory effects of zymogen FXII-mediated activation of urokinase
plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) on neutrophils. Recently, we found that patients with SCD exhibit
chronically enhanced FXII activation compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we showed that FXII expression
is elevated in SCD neutrophils, and that FXII contributes to neutrophil activation and adhesion in SCD.
Importantly, treatment with an anti-FXII antibody that blocks both zymogen and enzymatic functions of FXII(a)
significantly attenuated experimental VT and microvascular stasis in a murine model of SCD. These findings
support the central hypothesis that FXII contributes to vaso-occlusion and VT in SCD through distinct cellular
and molecular mechanisms.
Using clinical samples and well-established murine model of SCD together with novel pharmacologic and genetic
approaches, our goals in this application are to: i) identify disease-specific triggers of FXII activation; ii)
characterize FXII effects on neutrophil functions; iii) investigate the relative contributions of different cellular
sources, and compare the zymogen versus protease functions of FXII in vascular stasis and VT; iv) determine
the effect of long-term FXII deficiency on disease progression and early mortality associated with SCD. Our goal
is to delineate the mechanisms by which FXII and its downstream effectors drive SCD pathologies, which will
lay the foundation for future therapeutic approaches to inhibit FXII."

Motile cilia are essential for lung defense, as evidenced by the genetic syndrome primary ciliary dyskinesia
(PCD). PCD is characterized by impaired motile cilia resulting in respiratory distress at birth, followed by chronic
sinopulmonary infection and bronchiectasis, which can lead to respiratory failure. There are no specific therapies
for PCD, in part because key pathways for motile cilia biogenesis and pathogenesis are not defined. PCD has
been linked to mutations in nearly 50 genes, which belong to three main groups: 1) Those encoding axonemal
dynein proteins - the motors necessary for cilia beating, 2) axonemal structural proteins, and 3) cytoplasmic
assembly and chaperon proteins. We have found that cells with variants in PCD genes have increased
expression of genes related to cell stress, including cytokines and interleukins. To better define the expression
profile of these cells, we used single cell RNA sequencing, and identified unique transcriptional changes in
ciliated cells from PCD patients that differed from those from healthy individuals. We identified activation of the
KEAP1-NRF2 pathway and differential gene expression of NRF2 target genes in PCD cells. The NRF2 pathway
is a major regulator of stress in cells. We also identified GSTA2 as a novel cilia axonemal protein that was
increased in PCD cells. GSTA2 is an enzyme that belongs to the glutathione pathway which is important for
protection from toxins and oxidative stress. This finding indicate that cilia have a dedicated glutathione pathway.
We hypothesize that GSTA2 plays a critical role in maintaining cilia function in health and disease, protecting
the ciliated cells from endogenous and exogenous factors. The exact function and mechanism of GSTA2 and
the NRF2 pathway in ciliated cells will be tested through the following Specific Aims: (1) Characterize and test
the requirement for a glutathione system in normal and PCD cilia; (2) Determine the role of the KEAP1-
NRF2 transcriptional program in the homeostasis of motile cilia and its activation in PCD. We will leverage
primary culture nasal cells from patients with mutations in different classes of PCD genes seen at our PCD clinic.
We will use advanced microscopy including expansion microscopy of native and tagged GSTA2 to determine
the localization of GSTA2. To define the role of the NRF2 pathway in ciliated cells and PCD, we will determine
the effects of pathway inhibition and activation in ciliated cells and measure changes in oxidative burden in cells.
We will use transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to investigate these novel candidates and define responses
to treatment. Finally, we will test these pathways using in vivo PCD models.
Findings generated through the proposed studies will provide fundamental understanding of motile cilia function
and provide novel therapeutic targets for PCD and motile cilia disease."
10831545,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software environment for analysis and
visualization of electrophysiological (e-phys) data. While originally focused on noninvasive EEG and MEG,
Brainstorm now also includes tools for analysis and advanced visualization of a broader range of data modalities:
intracranial EEG including ECOG, SEEG macroelectrode recordings, MUA and LFP microelectrode data in
humans and in-vitro/in-vivo preparations in animal models, and noninvasive NIRS data. The software is widely
used and plays an increasingly important role in clinical and cognitive neuroscience research as reflected in the
following statistics over the past decade: 1,700 published articles reporting analyses performed with Brainstorm,
30,000 user accounts, 34,000 posts on the online user forum, and 2,000 students, postdocs and faculty around
the globe have attended in-person or online Brainstorm training events. Over the past four years we have built
on the extensive capabilities of Brainstorm by defining and implementing a BIDS-compatible database structure
and adding tools for cloud/advanced computing over distributed data resources. We have added improved
interfaces with other EEG/MEG software, leading spike-sorting e-phys software, and hardware (including the
ability to import from multiple commercial file data formats). We have also added interoperability with MRI-
analysis software and deployed tools for FEM-based head modeling. Under this renewal we will address the
following: Aim 1: Enabling Tools for Naturalistic and Single-Trial Neurophysiology Studies: There is
increasing scientific interest in eliciting, recording, and analyzing neural responses to non-repetitive and
naturalistic stimuli. Data of this type present particular challenges in terms of documenting rigorously varied,
uncontrolled sensory events and behavioral responses with machine and human readable annotations, and
relating such complex sensory presentations and behavior to measured brain activity. We will therefore develop
a suite of tools for preparing and analyzing multimodal e-phys data in the context of naturalistic neuroscience.
Aim2: Tools for Invasive Recordings: We will build on developments in the current project period to provide
tools for preprocessing and analysis of invasive recordings and FEM-based modeling of intracranial current fields
including labelling, localization and co-registration of complex iEEG electrode montages from X-ray CT to MRI,
automated identification and tagging of interictal features in iEEG, and characterization, localization and
validation of neuronal sources from iEEG. Aim 3: Software Enhancement, Integration, Maintenance,
Training, and Documentation: We will pursue a three-pronged development track: (i) a hub-based framework
in which third-party tools can be linked, run and with results visualized entirely from Brainstorm as a hub; (ii) build
on our existing provenance tools so that users can save analysis histories to allow full reproducibility; and (iii)
provide links and interoperability with statistical packages to promote rigor. We will continue to develop
Brainstorm with multiplatform compatibility, web-based documentation, user forums, and hands-on training."
10831390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common origin of dementia, is frequently accompanied by circadian rhythm
disruption. It is not clear how circadian function relates to neurodegeneration, but deletion of the core circadian
transcription factor (TF) BMAL1 in astrocytes causes both an AD-like cellular phenotype and increased neuron
loss after oxidative stress. Within astrocytes of a mouse model of AD, we have observed a phenomenon known
as circadian reprogramming, in which some genes lose circadian expression while other genes gain circadian
expression. The goal of this proposal is to determine how circadian reprogramming is regulated in astrocytes of
our AD mouse model. I hypothesize that within AD-model astrocytes, BMAL1 interacts with disease-specific TFs
to bind to new genomic locations and cause new genes to become rhythmic. To test this hypothesis, I will 1)
determine whether BMAL1 changes in astrocytes of our AD mouse model to bind to reprogrammed genes (Aim
1), and 2) identify TF motif combinations sufficient to produce circadian gene expression and reprogramming in
astrocytes of our AD mouse model (Aim 2). To characterize BMAL1 binding in Aim 1, I have preliminary data
that FLEXCCs, a technology to record TF binding on a cell type specific level, can be used to record BMAL1
binding. For this project, I will use FLEXCCs to record BMAL1 binding in astrocytes of both wildtype mice and in
our AD mouse model. In Aim 2, I will identify TF motif combinations that drive circadian expression in our AD
mouse model using a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) and capture astrocytic transcripts with
translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-sequencing (TRAP-seq). This proposal will begin to determine how
the cellular environment of AD-like astrocytes generates circadian reprogramming. By establishing a mechanism
of circadian reprogramming in astrocytes in a mouse model of AD, I will help elucidate how circadian disruption
progresses in AD and uncover new pathways to potentially alter disease course."

10863595,"For pandemic preparedness, structural biology and structure-based vaccine design are critical to the
prototype pathogen approach. Vaccine developers must select the viral protein(s) to be included in the
vaccine based on knowledge gained from studying the prototype viruses in each family. They must
also determine the optimal presentation of these viral proteins to effectively stimulate the immune
system and elicit the desired immune response. Structural biology guides these decisions and provides
the blueprint for rational design of engineered vaccine antigens. It also aids characterization of the
antigens, defines the epitopes of potently neutralizing antibodies, and provides insight into the
mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization, all of which enables iterative optimization of the antigen
designs. To support the Research Projects in achieving their objectives, Core C: Structure and
Protein Engineering will provide services encompassing protein engineering and production,
characterization, and structural biology.
 Dr. Jason McLellan (UT Austin), an expert in structural virology and the development of structure-
based interventions for viral pathogens, will lead Core C. His laboratory is well known for their ability to
determine viral protein structures and antibody complexes via X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.
Furthermore, the McLellan laboratory has a wealth of experience in protein engineering, expression, and
purification. Dr. Jimmy Gollihar (Houston Methodist) and his team will contribute to Core C their proficiency
in synthetic biology, laboratory automation, and high-throughput screening and selection technologies. Core
C will perform high-throughput protein engineering and production, allowing hundreds of designed
protein constructs to be biophysically characterized for thermal stability, conformational homogeneity, and
antibody reactivity. Select protein antigens meeting pre-specified criteria will be provided to the Research
Projects and Cores to facilitate their studies, including immunogenicity experiments, antibody isolation, and
assay development. Core C will also determine structures of wildtype and variant viral proteins, including
complexes with antibody fragments. These structural insights will provide the atomic-level information
necessary for designing effective vaccine antigens, and the reagents and data generated by Core C will aid
the development of vaccine and antibody strategies for emerging enveloped RNA viruses in the

10860291,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)., the most common genetic kidney disease in the
world, is characterized by progressive kidney tubule cyst growth, and after decades of tubule damage, it leads
to declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney failure. By the time this GFR decline is detected, nearly
half the original functional glomeruli and tubules are irreversibly lost. Currently, there is no cure for ADPKD and
the vasopressin receptor antagonist tolvaptan is the only drug approved by the FDA to slow progression
Tolvaptan slows GFR decline, but is expensive, difficult to take, and has considerable side effects. There is an
unmet need to study novel tubular biomarkers in persons with ADPKD with the goal of improving early
identification and quantification of risk for progression, targeted treatment for the highest risk individuals, and
enrichment methods for future clinical trials.
 We have worked extensively to expand the paradigm of tubular function in kidney disease. We have
demonstrated the utility of a focused kidney tubule health panel (KTHP) consisting of proximal tubule injury,
tubulo-interstitial inflammation, repair and fibrosis, and secretion in the general population, and among those
with CKD, HIV, and heart failure. However, persons with ADPKD were not included in these studies, and our
preliminary data demonstrate that several of these tubule markers are particularly perturbed in APDKD. Our
goal is to develop an ADPKD-specific KTHP which will incorporate different dimensions of tubular health and
injury, improve kidney failure risk prognostication of persons, and evaluate the potential salient effects of
tolvaptan on tubular health.
 We propose to use a unique repository of biospecimens at multiple timepoints from over 2,700 persons with
ADPKD who were enrolled in the Phase 3 TEMPO 3:4 and REPRISE trials – both are placebo-controlled trials
of tolvaptan in ADPKD. In Aim 1 we will develop and compare KTHP dimensions and correlate them with
ADPKD severity, with the hypothesis that these markers will identifying ADPKD patients at highest risk for
rapid kidney disease progression, above and beyond currently available clinical and imaging measures.
Leveraging the design of the clinical trials, we will compare the effect of tolvaptan versus placebo on tubule
health markers (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether short-term changes in kidney tubule health
biomarkers can predict long-term progression of ADPKD (Aim 3). This comprehensive approach to
phenotypying tubular health will advance the role of tubular biomarkers in risk stratification, patient
identification, and monitoring response to treatment in ADPKD."
10840829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intestinal epithelial cells protect the host from pathogens and prevent exaggerated inflammatory responses
that cause collateral injury. Defining the cellular mechanisms that regulate intestinal inflammation is an
essential first step to uncover therapeutic targets that can manipulate these physiological processes to the
host's advantage. Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate
metabolism and many other aspects of cellular physiology. However, little is known about how nuclear
hormone receptors influence intestinal inflammation or the innate recognition of bacterial pathogens. In C.
elegans, the family of nuclear hormone receptors has dramatically expanded compared to other metazoans,
particularly those that are homologous to the human intestinal nuclear hormone receptor hepatocyte nuclear
factor 4 (HNF4). These proteins may, therefore, have critical roles in nematode physiology. In this competitive
renewal application, we aim to determine how nuclear hormone receptors regulate immune activation and
pathogen resistance. We will test the conceptually innovative hypothesis that nuclear hormone receptors
function as pathogen sensors that directly activate innate immune defenses in intestinal epithelial cells. C.
elegans does not seem to rely on canonical pattern recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors) to sense
pathogen infection and activate immune defense in intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the key implication of our
findings is that the nuclear hormone receptor family in C. elegans expanded, at least in part, because of their
function in pathogen detection and immune regulation.
In the first funding period, we identified a homolog of mammalian HNF4 that surveys the chemical environment
and activates anti-pathogen immune defenses. In this competitive renewal application, we will test the
conceptually innovative hypothesis that sensing of a pathogen-derived bacterial metabolite by this nuclear
hormone receptor is an ancient mechanism utilized by C. elegans to detect toxigenic pathogens in its
environment that have grown to dangerous levels and are poised to cause disease (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will
determine if this pathogen-derived metabolite is a natural ligand for NHR-86 that directly binds to and activates
this nuclear hormone receptor, an effort that will characterize the first bona fide innate immune pattern
recognition receptor and its natural ligand in C. elegans and de-orphan a nuclear hormone receptor. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will characterize the role of another HNF4 homolog in innate immunity, which will provide important
support for the innovative idea that members of this protein family function as pathogen sensors in an
organism that lacks canonical mechanisms of pattern recognition.
The proposed study will reveal fundamental insights into previously unrecognized, evolutionary ancient
strategies of immune activation and regulation that will have broad implications for the study of innate immunity
in all metazoans."
10840963,"Project Summary/Abstract: Collecting representative and inclusive data about sexual 
orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is a critical component of combating the devastating 
health disparities affecting sexual and gender minority (SGM) older adults. This is particularly 
crucial for patients living with ADRD, which is widely regarded as a family disease requiring the 
active caregiver involvement, particularly with advanced disease. Failure to collect and integrate 
SOGI data to identify patients’ informal support systems may have adverse health 
consequences for SGM older adults, particularly for those dependent on informal caregivers to 
provide in-home support and assist with activities of daily living. Improper identification of 
chosen family and caregivers contributes to incomplete care delivery and disenfranchised grief. 
Given the historical discrimination experienced by older SGM people, adding SOGI questions 
without proper training has the potential to harm patients and create staff discomfort rather than 
foster inclusive interactions. For this career development award, I propose to characterize SOGI 
data collection challenges from patients and caregivers enrolling in hospice while exploring 
understudied intersections, such as SGM people living with ADRD, and how they affect staff 
approaches to delivering person-centered care. These insights will be used to develop and pilot 
test an intervention to train hospice interdisciplinary team (IDT) staff to sensitively collect and 
utilize SOGI data to improve communication with SGM patients and caregivers. Candidate, 
Mentors and Proposed Training: I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado 
School of Medicine. My long-term goal is to become a leader in communication aging research 
to reduce health disparities by affecting change for SGM older adults via more effective, personcentered communication. This work will harness my background as a communication health 
researcher, my previous research with hospices and older SGM communities including those 
living with ADRD, and my lived experience as a SGM person. Research Plan: My research aims 
to: 1) characterize barriers and facilitators to communicating with SGM patients and caregivers 
who have a serious illness, with a special emphasis on those with ADRD; 2) develop an 
educational intervention for hospice IDT members to improve communication with older SGM 
patients; and 3) pilot test a novel communication training intervention for feasibility and 
acceptability of behavior change to engage in meaningful dialogue. My training goals include 
developing additional expertise in: 1) statistical methods for testing hypotheses and evaluating
clinical trial interventions; 2) community-based stakeholder engagement and bioethical 
intervention development; and 3) clinical trials and intervention development and evaluation. 
This K01 is critical to my becoming an independent leader in SGM aging research. Implication: 
This project will not only inform how to improve SOGI data collection but will contribute to 
communication behavior change to facilitate meaningful dialogue with SGM older adults, 
including those with ADRD, and their caregivers around the end of life."
10840967,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Comprising proactive (goal-directed) and reactive (stimulus-driven) processes, cognitive control is critical to daily
functions for older adults. However, how aging influences proactive and reactive control remains unclear, with
studies of the AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT) reporting impaired proactive but intact reactive control
and studies of the stop signal task (SST) reporting the opposite. Further, the structural and functional cerebral
bases of age-dependent changes in cognitive control have not been studied systematically. We aim to employ
an innovative experimental design to address this gap in research. On the basis of the literature and our
preliminary findings, we will investigate hippocampal dysfunction and impairment in contextual processing as a
determinant of cognitive control deficits during aging and in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Specifically, we aim to examine how contextual representation (i.e., explicit stimulus-response mapping in the
AX-CPT and implicit inference in the SST) rather than motor demand (i.e., omnipresent response in the AX-CPT
and conditional response in the SST) contribute to age-related deficits in cognitive control. By including two
variants of the behavioral tasks, the AXn-CPT, where non-target response is replaced with no response, and
SSTr, where stop signal instructs an alternative motor response instead of no response, we propose to
distinguish the psychological constructs that dictate age- and MCI-related changes in proactive and reactive
control. By combining the behavioral tasks and fMRI we will investigate how structural and functional brain
changes account for age- and MCI-related alterations in cognitive control. First, we hypothesize that, if contextual
representation accounts for the effects of aging and MCI, aging will be associated with impaired proactive and
intact reactive control in both AX-CPT and AXn-CPT, and with intact proactive and impaired reactive control in
both SST and SSTr. Conversely, if motor demand accounts for the effects, older adults will show impaired
proactive and intact reactive control in AX-CPT and SSTr, as well as intact proactive and impaired reactive
control in SST and AXn-CPT. Second, we hypothesize that deficient control is associated with disrupted
activation and functional connectivity in the hippocampus and other task-related regions. In particular, the
anterior and posterior hippocampus may play distinct roles in supporting reactive and proactive control. Third,
we hypothesize age-related decreases in hippocampal and prefrontal cortical gray matter volume and will explore
how this structural deficit relates to age-dependent alterations in functional activations during cognitive control.
Further, disproportionate volumetric decline and altered activations in the hippocampus may be associated with
deteriorated cognitive control in MCI. Together, the proposed study will delineate the psychological and neural
processes underlying executive control dysfunction in aging and MCI, addressing a critical gap of research in
aging neuroscience. We hope that the findings would inform the care of older adults in health and illness."

Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology (TPCB)
The Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology (TPCB) is an innovative graduate program that
provides students with comprehensive training at the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine. TPCB is
unique in that it is offered jointly by three premier research institutions with adjacent campuses in the heart of
New York City: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Rockefeller University, and Weill Cornell
Medical College. This stand-alone, direct admission graduate program was established in 2001 as one of the
first in the nation to focus specifically on training the next generation of chemical biology researchers.
Over the last 19 years, TPCB has established itself as a leading graduate program in chemical biology, with 70
PhD graduates and 43 current students (26 training grant-eligible, TGE). Students come from both chemical
and biological backgrounds and the program combines quantitative chemical training with deep insights into
forefront problems in biomedical research. Students also come from a wide range of scientific and cultural
backgrounds and this diversity is celebrated. The program welcomes students from underrepresented minority
groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds (currently totaling
35% of TGE) and works with each student individually to ensure they have the resources necessary to thrive.
The curriculum includes two chemical biology courses created specifically for TPCB students, additional core
and elective courses, a seminar course, lab rotations, student Research-in-Progress seminars, annual student-
organized Tri-I Chemical Biology Symposium and TPCB Student Career Development Retreat, and the
Sanders Tri-I Chemical Biology Seminar Series. Students receive extensive career development training and
formal ongoing instruction in Responsible Conduct of Research and Rigor & Reproducibility. Students have
opportunities to conduct PhD thesis research with 54 dedicated faculty mentors working across the spectrum of
chemical biology with >$1M average annual funding. Students move seamlessly between the three institutions
and have access to the state-of-the-art research facilities and rich scientific environment on all three
campuses, providing diverse opportunities to pursue fundamental and translational research and to engage in
multidisciplinary collaborations. Importantly, TPCB students are deeply involved in the organization and design
of the training experience, and the program has evolved continually in response to student feedback.
As a result, TPCB students have been exceptionally productive, publishing over 400 scientific papers (average
5.2 papers/graduate), graduating in an average of 5.5 years. TPCB alumni have continued onto a wide range
of successful careers across the tenure track (17%), pharma (12%), biotech (29%), other labs (10%), and
research-related careers (31%). TPCB receives strong institutional support but is still unable to admit all of the
qualified candidates who apply. Thus, this NIGMS Chemistry–Biology Interface T32 training grant will enable
further growth and enhancement of this successful training program and its broader impacts on the community."
10841500,"SUMMARY
Numerous viruses initiate infection by binding to cell surface glycans of the host. The selectivities of viral
receptor binding proteins for specific glycans critically determine host range, tissue- and cell tropism
and pathogenesis. A detailed understanding of receptor usage by respiratory viruses is critical for the
development of surveillance, prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemic
outbreaks. Glycan receptor usage by respiratory viruses have been difficult to probe because of a lack
of appropriate panels of glycans for structure-activity studies. The latter is due to limitations in synthetic
methodologies that do not permit the preparation of large panels of biological relevant glycans.
In this program, chemoenzymatic methodologies will be developed that make it possible to prepare a
wide range of N-glycan found in the respiratory tract of human and relevant animals. It is based on a
new synthetic paradigm, which we coined “Stop-and-Go-Chemoenzymatic Glycosylation”. It uses
chemically modified sugar nucleotide donors that can be employed by relevant glycosyl transferases to
give products in which particular residues are temporarily blocked from further enzymatic modification.
At an appropriate stage of synthesis, the blocking group can be removed to give a natural glycan. The
speed of glycan synthesis will be increased by developing an automation platform that can perform
enzymatic and chemical manipulations. The new methodologies will be used to prepare a collection of
complex N-glycans that resemble structures expressed by respiratory tissue for host-pathogen studies.
In this application, the collection of glycans will used to examine in detail receptor usage of influenza A
viruses. The glycans will be printed as a microarray to probe binding specificities of human and animal
influenza A viruses. Selected compounds will be examined in dynamic binding assays to establish the
interplay between hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) activity. The proposed studies will
uncover unique traits of human and animal IAVs, which will facilitate the implementation of surveillance,
prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate risks of future pandemics. The result of the studies will
be exploited to develop an array-based system to antigenically characterize IAVs, which will greatly
facilitate strain selection for seasonal flu vaccination.

10841501,"Background. Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause LV dysfunction or
cardiomyopathy (CM), referred to as PVC-cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM). The mechanism responsible this CM is
unclear. A PVC—CM canine model was key not only to prove that PVC-CM can be induced in a normal structural
heart, but also to identify preliminary cellular and molecular features that may explain the development of LV
dysfunction. Until recently an alternative PVC-Cardiomyopathy model has been described in the swine species.
This model appears to have similar echocardiographic features to the canine model, although molecular features
remain unknown. The main objective of this study is to validate a PVC-CM in a swine model.
Hypotheses. Our main hypotheses is that similar to the PVC-CM canine model, the swine model will
demonstrate: 1) mild to moderate LV dysfunction, mild mitral regurgitation and diastolic dysfunction in early-
coupled PVC, while early PVCs will demonstrate less degree of LV dyssynchrony when compared to late-coupled
PVCs (Aim 1); 2) an increase in interleukin and TNF-alpha signaling, while a decrease in mesenchyme
development, neuron projection extension and muscle contraction genes (Aim 2); 3) similar changes in the dyad,
characterized by decrease in ICaL and down-regulation of Cav1.2, JPH-2, L-type Ca2+ channel misplacement out
of the dyad and decrease in BIN1 with impaired Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (Aim 3); 3); and 4) a minimum chronic
exposure of 25% PVC burden is required to develop PVC-CM (Aim 4).
Aim 1. Validate the cardiac structural changes in a PVC-CM swine model and impact of post-extrasystolic
potentiation and PVC coupling interval in the development of PVC-CM.
Aim 2. Confirm Transcriptomic profiling associated with PVC-CM in the swine model.
Aim 3. Corroborate the structural and molecular changes including their role on the pathophysiology of PVC-
CM and recovery upon PVC cessation in the swine model.
Aim 4. Validate PVC burden, baseline echocardiographic, hemodynamic and molecular features that can
predict the development of, or resilience to PVC-CM in the swine model despite identical ventricular ectopy.
Methods. 56animals will undergo pacemaker implant to reproduce frequent ventricular ectopy (PVCs). They
will be randomized to one of 5 groups: 1) late-coupled 50% PVCs (n=13), 2) early-coupled 50% PVCs (n=13), 3)
early-coupled PVCs 33% PVCs (n=10), early-coupled 25% PVCs (n=10), or 4) sham (n=10). At the end of a 12-
week PVC period, a recovery phase (disabling PVCs) will be allowed in 5 animals of each group exposed to 50%
burden and sham group (Fig. 6). Serial cardiac evaluation and biopsies will allow us to assess LV function,
transcriptomic profile, dyad structure, Ca2+ transients (EC coupling), changes in JPH-2 and Cav1.2 expression,
function and distribution and their mediators at baseline and different time points of PVC-CM in all groups.
Significance. This proposal is designed to validate most echocardiographic, hemodynamic, molecular and
cellular changes demonstrated in a new PVC-CM Swine model. A new swine PVC-CM model will provide: 1)
corroboration of this clinical entity in mammalians, 2) expand our understanding of the mechanism t of PVC-
CM as swine has some favorable techniques and procedures, such as viral transfection with AAV-9 to modify
cellular and molecular expression, but most importantly 3) minimize the use of a unique and special large
species such as the dog. Understanding the mechanism of PVC-CM will help us to identify high-risk patients
to develop PVC-CM, but most importantly find future targets to prevent and treat subjects with PVC-CM."
10841502,"1.0 Abstract
Chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for over half of morbidity and reductions in quality
of life, in resource-limited settings. Of particular importance is the growing epidemic of multi-morbidity, or the
accumulation of chronic conditions, including combinations of both non-communicable (e.g. hypertension,
diabetes, COPD, traumatic accidents, and cancer) and communicable diseases (e.g. HIV, prior lung disease
from pneumonia) on functioning, well-being and quality of life. Despite the growing appreciation of overlapping
conditions and their cumulative effect on health outcomes, the majority of disease treatment programs, donor
funding mechanisms, and research infrastructures focus on infectious diseases, and such programs remain
largely siloed. This separation of efforts results in three critical short-comings to the research infrastructure in
many low-income settings: 1) a poor understanding and limited attention paid to the interactive effects
between, and management of, comorbid conditions; 2) lack of attention to region-specific risk factors for multi-
morbidity that are likely to differ from high-resource settings (e.g. social determinants of health, occupational
exposures, air pollution); and 3) a near total absence of the requisite laboratory infrastructure for cross-cutting
multidisciplinary clinical research to support holistic care for those with multi-morbid conditions. To respond to
these gaps in research infrastructure in Uganda, we will conduct the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop junior faculty expertise in Uganda on multi-morbidity. We will focus training on a
holistic understanding of human health, and an understanding of how accumulation of chronic
conditions impacts functioning and quality of life in this setting.
Aim 2: Train junior faculty to measure determinants and consequences of the regional social
and environmental risk factors for multi-morbidity. Key focus areas will include social-behavioral
and environmental determinants of health.
Aim 3: Develop laboratory capacity to support clinical research on multi-morbidity. We will
leverage an established Memorandum of Understanding between the Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) and the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) Clinical Research Laboratory to
support capacity building, quality assurance, and a trans-disciplinary clinical laboratory program to
focus on multi-morbidity diagnostics and regionally appropriate risk factor testing.
In this D43 research training program, we will leverage a 15-year partnership between MUST and MGH, to
provide sustained mentorship and protected research time to 12 promising post-doctoral and junior faculty
members at MUST and establish a Ugandan regional center of excellence in multi-morbidity research."
10841631,"Fatty acids (FAs) are essential in the developing brain for myelination, neurogenesis, and lipid membrane
turnover. During fetal and early postnatal brain development, FA synthesis in the brain is necessary for rapid
structural brain growth. However, FAs can also serve as a source of energy. Recent evidence suggests that
neural stem and progenitor cells rely largely on FA oxidation for energy. The question is whether the balance
between FA synthesis and oxidation (FA metabolism) in the brain shifts after injury. Neonatal brain injury is a
major contributor to long-term neurodevelopmental delays. The response to injury and endogenous recovery
phase is metabolically expensive, imposing additional energy demands and disrupting the highly orchestrated
process of brain development and maturation. Therefore, there is a critical need to delineate acute and long-
term metabolic adaptations after neonatal brain injury. Our preliminary results show that the neonatal injured
brain from intermittent hypoxia has decreased FA composition, increased dependency on FAs as a fuel
compared to other substrates and increased FA oxidation. In addition, FA mobilization for oxidation is increased
days after injury. Based on these results, we hypothesize that metabolic adaptations after neonatal brain injury
directly perturb the balance of FA synthesis and oxidation, thereby disrupting the timely developmental trajectory
of brain growth and maturation. We will test our hypothesis in three aims. In the first aim, we will determine
temporal and spatial contributions of FA metabolism after neonatal brain injury. This aim will delineate time- and
region-specific FA composition in the hippocampus, white matter, and subventricular zone. The region-specific
composition of FAs and substrates will be measured with tandem mass spectrometry and MALDI- mass
spectrometry imaging. We will measure protein, RNA, and metabolic flux in region- and cell-specific populations.
Studies will be performed that will measure dependency, capacity, and flexibility to utilize FAs and other
substrates from different brain regions and time points after injury. In the second aim, we will determine whether
time-specific alteration of FA metabolism in progenitor cells disrupts their normal developmental trajectory. We
will specifically remove an obligate gene responsible for FA synthesis or oxidation in neural progenitor cells to
answer the question whether FA metabolism regulates neural progenitor cell activity in the neurogenic niches.
In the third aim, we will test whether brain FA oxidation after neonatal brain injury is adaptive or maladaptive.
This aim will study the role of FA oxidation in the developing brain and after neonatal brain injury using pan-
brain-specific loss of either the obligate gene in FA oxidation or the gene responsible for the rate-limiting step of
FA translocation into the mitochondria. Overall, this project will delineate the time-course and contribution of FAs
toward metabolic flexibility. The outcomes of this study will inform the science of FA metabolism and guide
development of new therapeutic targets aimed at balancing metabolic demands after neonatal brain injury."
10841634,"Vision impairment limits a person's ability to communicate, to learn, to work, and to travel. In the United
States alone, there are 1.3 million legally blind, including 55,000 children. Traditionally, blind children were taught
with Braille as the written medium. However, in recent years, literacy rates among the blind have declined to
alarmingly low levels, primarily due to the rapid advancement of cheap and accessible audio devices. While
audio devices have improved individual access to information, Braille and other tactile medium are important for
forming connections between concepts and physical objects. More importantly, Braille literacy directly correlates
with success in high education and employment. The majority of the blind people who are employed are Braille
readers. Unfortunately, Braille devices have remained bulky and expensive, relying on aging technologies.
Refreshable Braille devices currently on the market are limited to 1 or 2 lines of characters (Braille cells), which
limits their display capabilities to pure text. There is an urgent need to employ modern technologies to develop
low-cost devices that enable communication, simplify education, and ensure the vision impaired are fully
integrated into society.
 The objective of this project is to develop a Braille electronic display panel that can assemble into compact
form factors such as smartphone cases. The panel will consist of an array of raised dots that can display Braille
text and topographical patterns representing graphics, maps, symbols, and more. The display content will be
refreshable akin to images on a smartphone screen. The target Braille panel, to be named PolyPad, will exploit
a variable stiffness polymer which we have recently innovated. The polymer exhibits a modulus change from
~100 MPa to ~0.1 MPa in a narrow temperature range of 40-45 oC. The large variable stiffness allows for large-
strain deformation in the softened state by relatively low pneumatic pressures, and for high shape fixation rate
and supporting force in the rigid state. Our preliminary study has also led to a highly compliant Joule heating
electrode that can electrically supply the temperature change for the polymer membrane and consequently alter
its stiffness. The driving voltage is on the order of 12 V; off-the-shelf, high-efficiency circuits could be employed.
The project will investigate the essential materials, processes, and structures needed to fabricate high-
performance PolyPad devices. The proof-of-concept PolyPad devices will be evaluated throughout the project,
providing formative user data throughout development and summative evaluation. Qualitative data will be
collected through the use of surveys and rating scales, and quantitative data on usability will include speed and
accuracy in reading and identifying graphic text.

10841486,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant and increasing problem. Medical management currently consists of
supportive care, with dialysis implemented for the most severe cases; however, morbidity and mortality remain
very high. A major reason for the lack of available treatments for AKI is a gap in the knowledge of how kidney
tubule cells recover from AKI, which has, therefore, limited possible approaches for treatment. Identifying, a
therapeutic target and pathway would meet a major unmet need by allowing for rational drug design. The goal
here is to determine whether the highly conserved eight-protein exocyst trafficking complex, and particularly the
central Sec10 (aka Exoc5) component, can be used to enhance recovery, and/or prevent injury, following AKI.
After renal tubule cell injury, there is initial loss of cell polarity, followed by cell death and sloughing of cells into
the lumen, then spreading and dedifferentiation of viable cells to cover the denuded area, with proliferation,
differentiation, and reestablishment of cell polarity. The polarity, or secretory, pathway is crucial for AKI recovery,
and cell function, and the exocyst is known for mediating the targeting and docking of secretory vesicles carrying
membrane proteins. Over the past twenty years, we showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway regulates tubulogenesis. We also showed that the exocyst, especially the Sec10 component, is centrally
involved in renal ciliogenesis and tubulogenesis. Specifically, Sec10 knockdown inhibited, and Sec10
overexpression increased, ciliogenesis and tubulogenesis. These distinct research areas recently converged, as
we showed that Sec10 speeded recovery from oxidative damage, an ischemia-like injury, by activating MAPK.
We have now generated Sec10fl/fl mice, and have preliminary data showing Sec10 deletion in murine proximal
tubules worsens ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, and inhibits repair. Furthermore, site-specific mutation of
the highly-conserved VxPx ciliary targeting sequence in human SEC10 inhibits tubulogenesis in cells grown in
3D collagen gels, and prevents the rescue of sec10 mutant zebrafish. The proposed experiments will test the
overall hypothesis that Sec10 activates the MAPK pathway, through the EGF receptor, to prevent injury
and/or enhance renal recovery following AKI, that this effect is mediated via primary cilia, and that Sec10
is a therapeutic target. Accordingly, we will investigate how Sec10 increases EGF receptor sensitivity, which
activates MAPK to enhance recovery from injury (Aim 1.1). We will then investigate how Sec10 and the exocyst
are involved in mitochondrial function. A critical pathway that has been identified in AKI is alterations in primary
tubular metabolism, which secondarily affect the regional circulation through decreased levels of ATP and
mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are also involved in ADPKD, the most common ciliopathy, suggesting a
possible link between cilia and mitochondria. Here we will investigate this novel pathway, and the possibility that
the exocyst could be the mediator between cilia and mitochondria function, possibly by differential protein
trafficking regulated by different small GTPases (Aim 1.2). We will test if Sec10 protection following AKI is
mediated via primary cilia by determining in mice if proximal tubule-specific knockout of Ift88, a protein necessary
for ciliogenesis, worsens injury and prevents recovery following I/R (Aim 2.1). If cilia appear to be centrally
involved, we will confirm this using our newly-generated Sec10 ciliary targeting sequence mutant mice and I/R
injury (Aim 2.2). Regardless of ciliary involvement, we will confirm that the MAPK pathway is involved in Sec10-
mediated protection from I/R injury in mice using small molecule inhibitors. We will then obtain proof of principle
that Sec10 can enhance recovery, and/or prevent injury, by using our newly-generated inducible Sec10-
overexpressing mice and performing I/R injury (Aim 3.1). Finally, we will determine if Sec10 gene delivery can
prevent injury, and/or enhance recovery, using viral and non-viral delivery of Sec10 in vivo prior to, and after, I/R
(Aim 3.2). Successful completion of these experiments will provide novel mechanistic insights into AKI
pathogenesis and recovery, and have a major impact on the development of new approaches to treat AKI."

Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease of accelerated aging.
Patients present with vascular stiffening, vascular calcification, and fibrous atherosclerotic plaque formation
causing vessel occlusion, which causes death between 7 and 20 years of age due to heart attack or stroke.
The disease arises from a point mutation (c.1824C>T) that produces the alternately spliced and farnesylated
protein progerin that accumulates in the cell nucleus. Progerin alters gene expression, causing increased
oxidative stress, apoptosis, and altered mitochondrial function. Pathological analysis of arteries of HGPS
patients shows loss of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and progerin in the medial vascular SMCs,
adventitial fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (ECs). While several potential therapeutics have been developed,
progress is limited by the few HGPS individuals available to enroll in clinical trials. During the first award
period, we developed an arteriole-scale tissue engineered blood vessel (TEBV) model using ECs and SMCs
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from individuals with HGPS. HGPS TEBVs
exhibit the pathology observed in the disease including progerin expression, loss of SMCs, and calcification.
HGPS ECs exhibit reduced expression of flow-mediated genes, are pro-inflammatory, and have reduced
NOS3 gene expression that prevents TEBV vasodilation. HGPS TEBVs show improved function in response
to the farnesyltransferase inhibitor Lonafarnib with or without the rapamycin analogue, Everolimus. In this
competing renewal, in collaboration with Dr. David Liu and Dr. Kan Cao we will evaluate the hypotheses that
(1) adenosine base editors (ABEs), precision genome editing tools that can directly correct the most common
genetic mutation in HGPS, eliminate progerin accumulation in HGPS vascular iPSC-derived ECs (viECs) and
SMCs (viSMCs), restoring normal function of individual cells and TEBVs; and (2) functional and genetic
changes observed in ABE-treated TEBVs are observed in an HGPS mouse model treated with ABEs. We will
examine the extent to which base editing of HGPS viECs and viSMCs restores function and gene expression
after biomechanical stimulation. We will evaluate TEBVs made with edited cells for vasoactivity, stiffness,
cellularity, EC function, progerin expression, and inflammation to establish if normal function is maintained over
5 weeks. To simulate in vivo conditions, we will perfuse HGPS TEBVs with adenovirus vectors containing
guide RNAs and ABEs. We will establish dosage, percent transduction, and measure virus penetration into
TEBVs to determine conditions needed to achieve effective correction of vascular pathology in HGPS. Using a
mouse G608 HGPS model, we will treat with conditions identified in TEBV studies and compare cellularity,
stiffness, and EC inflammation. Single cell RNA-Seq will be used to evaluate the impact of editing on the
vascular cells in the mouse vessels and TEBVs after ABE treatment. Results of this study will provide
important information to advance ABEs to clinical trials for HGPS and use of ABEs to correct genetic diseases."

Shift workers represent nearly 30 % of the US workforce, and this occupational hazard conveys increased risk
for multiple pathologies. Still, the specific mechanisms behind this increased risk of illness by shift workers as
well as investigation of screening targets to identify susceptible individuals are scarcely known.
Our preclinical research and initial translational studies provide insight into the basis of shift-work disease and
show that markers of systemic inflammation appear to increase as a function of exposure-duration to shift work.
However, when samples are challenged with bacterial endotoxin, we find that low-grade systemic inflammation
does no warrant a heightened ex-vivo endotoxin response. As shift work exposure increases, the relationship
between systemic inflammation and endotoxin responses weakens, suggesting a mismatch between discrete pro-
and anti-inflammatory pathways during endotoxin challenge. Novel systemic signals in plasma samples from
shift workers identify a potential mediator of shift-work related disruption of inflammation. These preliminary
results illustrate how shift work impacts the complex interaction of events needed to initiate and control an
efficient response to an inflammatory challenge and support the hypothesis that chronic dysregulation of
inflammation is behind the increased risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease in shift workers.
In this application, we propose to conduct a cross-sectional prospective study of day workers and career shift
workers exposed to temporally changing occupational environments. We will further develop and improve a
profile of shift-work risk assessment which includes individual metrics of systemic inflammation, cardiovascular
disease, stress, sleep/activity, diet composition, and circadian disruption. This assessment aims to quantify the
state of low-grade systemic inflammation characteristic of shift work exposure as a potential predictor of the
response of the immune system to a controlled, ex-vivo and in-vitro, endotoxin challenge. We aim to assess the
potential mechanisms by which increased inflammation determine dysregulated activation and test the central
hypothesis that the degree of low-grade systemic inflammation worsens with increased shift work exposure.
Our primary goal is to understand how shift work exposure duration leads to the development of uncontrolled
inflammation in career shift workers increasing disease risk. This work is of paramount importance because it
could lead to early diagnostic tools that can help mitigate shift-work disease. On the long term, we seek to uncover
the mechanistic links between shift work exposure and disease."

Diffuse white matter disease (DWD) is a common manifestation of small-vessel cerebrovascular pathology and
a key subtype of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, the
mechanistic underpinnings of DWD remain incompletely characterized. Based on assessment of extensive
data in humans and animal models, we have identified angiogenic mediators, in particular placental
growth factor (PlGF), as being strongly associated with diffuse white matter disease.
 Much like the pathologic angiogenesis that occurs in retinopathies, pathologic angiogenesis in the brain
results in blood-brain barrier leakage and, counterintuitively, tissue ischemia. We have exciting preliminary
data indicating robust relationships between PlGF and human DWD. We have also identified PlGF as being
increased in association with blood-brain barrier leakage. We hypothesize that PlGF, and related
angiogenic mediators, result in pathologic angiogenesis, with leaky, tortuous vessels and surrounding
inflammation, leading to diffuse white matter disease. Importantly, these pathologic changes also
represent a potentially targetable mechanism to improve cognition in aging. To test these hypotheses,
we propose focused studies in an extensively characterized human cohort, and a mouse model of small vessel
disease. We answer the “what, where, why” questions surrounding PlGF. “What” cell type is responsible for
PlGF; “where” is PlGF being expressed; “why” is PlGF upregulated and can it be modulated. To test these
hypotheses, we propose focused studies in an extensively characterized human autopsy cohort, and a mouse
model of small vessel disease:
Specific Aim 1: Determine contributions to plasma PLGF, and related angiogenic proteins, using cell-
specific exosomes and their association with periventricular and deep white matter pathologies.
Specific Aim 2: Ascertain the regional expression of PLGF, and related angiogenic proteins, within,
adjacent to, and distant from, periventricular and DWD and the association with aberrant angiogenesis.
Specific Aim 3: Test the potential to manipulate PLGF related small vessel pathology in response to
hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced small vessel disease."
10841614,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the most deployed molecular targeting agents in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) is the
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibody cetuximab (CTX). Cetuximab is a
central component of the first-line EXTREME regimen and in combination with radiation therapy and is the only
drug that exhibits efficacy in both locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic HNC. Although many HNC
patients see CTX over the course of their cancer therapy, research over the past decade has revealed that
many patients that do respond initially will eventually become refractory to CTX.
 To identify drivers of CTX resistance (CTXR) in HNC, our lab utilized HNC human tumor specimens,
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and a series of acquired and intrinsically resistant in vitro and in vivo model
systems. This work led to the identification of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL as a central driver of
CTXR. To define the molecular mechanisms of how AXL signaling leads to CTXR, three tyrosine residues of
AXL (Y779, Y821, Y866) were mutated and mapped for their sensitivity to CTX. Both in vitro and in vivo
analysis revealed that 1) CTXR emanates from signaling from Y821 of AXL via the c-Abl kinase, 2) pre-clinical
modeling (PDX) indicated that the combination of CTX plus imatinib (IMT), a c-Abl kinase inhibitor, lead to
complete tumor regression without recurrence in HNC models and 3) preliminary data for this application
suggests that AXL, via Y821, sequesters c-Abl in the cytosol and prevents it from moving to the nucleus, which
is induced by IMT, to promote apoptosis. Collectively, we hypothesize that AXL plays a critical role in CTXR by
sequestering c-Abl in the cytosol and that therapeutic targeting c-Abl in combination with CTX will lead to
profound responses in HNC patients. We plan to conduct this interdisciplinary project, spanning from basic
biology to a pilot clinical trial through the three following aims: 1) To investigate if a) cytoplasmic sequestration
of c-Abl is responsible for AXL mediated CTXR and if b) if AXL and c-Abl association is a predictive biomarker
of CTX response, 2) determine if targeting EGFR and c-Abl simultaneously in CTXR PDXs can enhance and re-
sensitize to CTX, and 3) To perform a pilot window-of-opportunity study of CTX plus imatinib in patients with
recurrent or metastatic HNC. Ultimately, our goal is to improve treatment outcomes for HNC patients.
Successful pursuit of these investigations has the potential to significantly improve and refine current HER
family-centric therapeutic approaches in HNC by understanding the molecular mechanisms of how Axl and
c-Abl impart CTXR. In addition, this project has high significance by repurposing two FDA approved drugs in a
new cancer setting to improve outcomes. Collectively, this work will impact future clinical treatment
paradigms and identify patients most likely to benefit from targeting EGFR and c-Abl in HNC."

Episodic memory involves the construction of a complex mental representation that includes key features of an
event (i.e., its people, objects, and places) and their relationships with one another. This process has been
reliably associated with activity in a core network of posterior medial (PM) brain regions, including areas in
medial temporal, medial parietal, and lateral parietal cortex. Yet much remains unknown about how these brain
regions contribute to the specificity with which distinct event features are bound and recalled. Past
investigations of memory specificity have largely focused on the contributions of individual brain regions, such
as the hippocampus and lateral parietal cortex. However, recent evidence suggests that memory specificity
may be explained, in part, by functional interactions among brain regions, including those in the PM network.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the brain network interactions predicting the
multidimensional quality of episodic memory, focusing on how distinct event features are bound into memory
and the specificity with which they are represented. Our central hypothesis is that there are separable
pathways through the PM network that maintain the general relational structure and specific details of an
event, and that these pathways must interact to embed specific details into event memories. We will test this
hypothesis by leveraging the complementary strengths of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and cognitive experimental design. First, we will examine variability in
memory binding and specificity across events, using analytic methods to predict memory quality based on
brain network interactions during encoding and retrieval (Aim 1). Second, we will test the causal role of PM
network interactions in episodic memory, using a combined TMS and fMRI design to identify post-stimulation
network changes and their impact on memory quality (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate individual differences
in episodic memory quality, testing whether they can be explained by differences in PM network recruitment
and organization (Aim 3). The proposed research advances a novel framework for understanding the
interactive pathways supporting episodic memory, with the potential to significantly transform our
understanding of the brain mechanisms supporting memory for complex events. Furthermore, by building a
model linking episodic memory quality to specific patterns of network activity and communication, we will be
better equipped to understand the mechanisms underlying changes in memory binding and specificity often
associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders."

Mast cells have been recognized as key effector cells in IgE-dependent allergic inflammation. Specifically,
studies have shown that a dysregulated expansion and/or activation of mast cells have detrimental
consequences in allergic disease. These studies highlight the urgent need for therapeutic approaches to target
mast cells specifically and safely. For this purpose, we conducted a study to comprehensively characterize the
mast cell surface protein repertoire to further understand how mast cells can transduce signals generated in a
complex environment that influences mast cell function in homeostasis and disease. This study revealed that
that mast cells express a large number of transporters from the Solute Carrier Protein (SLC) family. The overall
goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that SLC transporters play a critical role in mast cell function and
can be targeted to reduce the severity of mast cell-associated diseases.
Our data indicate that from the novel pool of SLCs, mast cells express high levels of the heavy chain of CD98
(CD98hc). Importantly, our data shows that CD98hc significantly contributes to granule homeostasis and storage
of mast cell preformed mediators hindering mast cell ability to release significant amounts of these mediators
upon activation. Moreover, we found that CD98hc plays a significant role in mast cell proliferation and adhesion
to extracellular matrix components. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that pharmacological targeting of
CD98hc can impair human mast cell functions. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that CD98hc and
the SLC family of transporters play an important role in mast cell homeostasis health and disease. In Aim 1, we
will determine the mechanisms by which CD98hc contribute to mast cell function. In Aim 2, we will assess
CD98hc contribution to mast cell function in allergic airway inflammation. Moreover, we will examine the effects
of an anti-CD98 antibody on human primary mast cell function and allergic airway inflammation. In Aim 3, we
will use a targeted CRISPR/Cas9 library to identify SLC transporters impacting function in human primary mast
cells.
Together, our studies have the potential to uncover novel biological roles for SLC transporters in mast cell
function. Finally, these studies will lay the groundwork for future projects that are aimed at exploring the
therapeutic potential of targeting SLC transporters to modulate disorders in which mast cells play an active role."

 Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) glomerulonephritis (GN) is a life-threatening
autoimmune disease. While current immunosuppressive agents produce remission in the majority of patients,
our treatment has had precision more akin to a chainsaw rather than a scalpel. The lack of specific, targeted
immune therapy leaves patients with an overly handicapped immune system and a host of toxic side effects. Our
proposal seeks to to finally advance the field toward more precise and targeted therapies with far less potential
for harm.
 Building upon our prior body of work, we will attempt to exploit the adaptive autoimmune responses seen
in ANCA GN as targets for immunomodulatory therapies by multiple approaches. By using our previously
developed epitope mapping techniques, we will engineer chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR) T cells that will
specifically target only those B cells that express the pathogenic ANCA antibody epitopes. In another approach,
we will profile the heterogeneous population of T regulatory cells. After identifying those that are fully
suppressive, we will attempt to expand this population in vitro and confirm that they retain their suppressive
function. This work will determine whether in future studies, we can first harvest these cells from ANCA GN
patients, expand them in vitro, and reintroduce them into patients to provide immunomodulatory effects that
would reintroduce autoimmune tolerance. Utilizing our well-characterized mouse model of myeloperoxidase
(MPO) ANCA GN, we will explore the mechanisms by which T (and B) regulatory cells suppress autoimmunity
and leverage this knowledge to develop pre-clinical models of T regulatory cell therapy.
 In addition to the potential role of cell-based therapies, we will explore the role of the innate immune
system in ANCA GN using our established MPO mouse model and novel models that we have developed of
granulomatous disease. These models will also us to identify components of the innate immune response that
may be amenable to novel therapies. Further, we will determine whether we can manipulate the epigenetic
changes that alter expression of the autoantigen proteins targeted by the autoimmune processes that drive
ANCA GN.
 These foundational studies have been designed with the intent to inform Investigative New Drug (IND)
applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This work will usher in a new therapeutic era for ANCA
GN, characterized by greater precision, less toxicity and perhaps, longer duration."

 The U.S. is undergoing rapid macrosocial transformations; the population is growing older and
becoming more diverse. An aging population needs more care; the frequency and burden of multiple chronic
conditions (MCC) are rapidly increasing. The recent health paradigm shift initiated by the Precision Medicine
Initiative, along with significant advances in computational science, artificial intelligence, and mobile/wearable
technology, now offers important opportunities to advance self-management science through the development
of strategies tailored to the individual level. Based not only on genetics but also psychosocial phenotypic
characteristics, the current pace of social and technological change demands a comprehensive, structured,
transdisciplinary approach to self-management research training for the next generation of nurse scientists.
 The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing is uniquely positioned to foster future nurse
scientists who can develop effective personalized interventions addressing the complex needs of self-
management for people with MCC. Located at the “epicenter of the health technology hub” in Austin, Texas,
within one of the most vibrant transdisciplinary health research environments in the nation, we are well
positioned to train future scientists in precision health methodologies addressing MCC-focused self-
management science. The school currently operates two strong centers for excellence focusing on
transdisciplinary research in self-management and health promotion for underserved populations. We also
have established collaborative agreements with four active T32 training programs (population science,
interdisciplinary neuroscience, biomedical engineering and medical informatics, and big data science) at UT-
Austin to facilitate high impact, transdisciplinary research training for all trainees in these four programs. To
capitalize on our momentum of collaborative research and maximize our educational resources, we propose a
new PhD training program (NIH T32) to provide future nurse scientists (13 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral
trainees over 5 years) with critical skills and knowledge to develop and implement innovative, effective and
personalized interventions for populations suffering from MCCs.
 The specific objectives of this transdisciplinary training program are: (1) To provide trainees with
cutting edge knowledge and methods for constructing precise, personalized interventions for people with
MCCs; (2) to utilize resources throughout our university and community to ensure training across disciplines to
develop creative, successful clinical investigators who will make a major impact on advancing self-
management science through precision health methodology; (3) to elevate the existing strengths of the
university’s collegial, interactive, interdisciplinary research environment by creating a national model for
training nurse scientists with precision health expertise."

The complexities of the proteome are both immense and dynamic, reflecting diverse, context-specific
expression of genes in individual cells and distinct isoforms for many proteins. In addition, individual proteins
may participate in several distinct protein assemblies during their lifetimes and undergo dynamic signal-
dependent re-organization in order to impart unique functions and cellular attributes. Moreover, numerous
protein assemblies self-combine and compartmentalize to generate organelles and signaling modules within
the cell, which are inherently dynamic. During the past 9 years, we have designed, validated, and applied a
platform for the large-scale analysis of protein interaction partners using affinity purification-mass spectrometry
(AP-MS) termed BioPlex, which has allowed us to profile interaction partners for over 10,000 nonredundant
human bait proteins in two contrasting human cell lines: HEK 293T and HCT116. In addition, we repeated
2000 of these IP’s in three additional cell lines – U2OS, RPE1, and HeLa – to broaden our exploration of cell-
specific interactomes. In aggregate, these 25,000 AP-MS experiments in five distinct cell lines have enabled us
to define an atlas of nearly 280,000 protein-protein interactions among 15,500 human proteins. The majority
have not been reported through independent efforts. The robustness of BioPlex, when benchmarked against
other studies and when compared across cell lines, parallels or exceeds available resources, allowing us to
broadly define human protein communities, predict functions and localizations of unstudied proteins based on
interaction partners, and define a large number of domain-domain enrichments that begin to impart structural
architecture upon the network. Finally, by repeating AP-MS experiments for thousands of baits in multiple cell
lines, we have created the first and largest proteome-scale, context-specific models of the human interactome,
revealing extensive remodeling that reflects the unique biology of each cell line. Yet, as valuable as these
BioPlex networks have been for biological discovery, they remain incomplete models of the human
interactome. Nearly 1 in 4 proteins do not appear in the BioPlex network at all, and a similar number of proteins
appear in these networks as preys only, providing just a partial view of their interactions. Finally, we have only
just begun to explore BioPlex in the context of other complementary genomics resources. In this renewal, we
seek to greatly enhance and extend our efforts in three major ways: First, we will prosecute an additional
7,500 genes in HEK293T cells. In this way, the BioPlex network will transition from utilizing 50% of all human
genes as baits to approximately 90% used as baits, revealing many novel interactions not possible previously.
Second, the same 7,500 clones will be examined in HCT116 cells to provide validation and explore cell line
specificity. Third, we will integrate BioPlex with complementary genome-scale resources including AlphaFold
and the Human Protein Atlas to model protein interactions at scales ranging from molecular interactions to
cellular structures."

The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 plays important roles in numerous biological processes, including
pH homeostasis and the immune response. Its activity has been found to worsen brain damage after
ischemic stroke, to exacerbate the effect of traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, and to increase
the metastatic potential of different types of cancer. The development of small-molecule modulators of
Hv1 activity could lead to new anti-inflammatory agents and anticancer drugs. In addition, Hv1
modulators can provide useful pharmacological tools for studying the function of the channel in health
and disease. Hv1 belongs to the large family of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs). The majority of
these proteins consist of four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) surrounding a central pore domain. While
many types of drugs bind the pore domain of VGICs, the number of organic molecules known to bind
VSDs is limited. The Hv1 channel is made of only two VSDs and does not contain a pore domain,
providing a simplified model for studying how ligands interact with VSDs. We have previously discovered
small molecules that inhibit Hv1 activity by binding within the intracellular vestibule of the channel VSD
in the open state (class I.1 ligands). Using a rational design approach that combines experimental and
computational methods, we identified related compounds that are able to bind the channel also in the
closed state (class I.2 ligands). Some of the new ligands display inhibitory properties that are superior
to those of class I.1 compounds and provide a promising scaffold for further development of high-affinity
Hv1 antagonists. However, little is known about how effective class I.2 ligands are at inhibiting Hv1-
regulated cellular processes, such as ROS production by NOX enzymes, or how specifically they target
the Hv1 VSD versus VSDs of other VGICs. In aim 1 of this project, we will apply our rational design
approach to develop I.2 ligands with improved potency and corresponding negative controls. We will
also use electrophysiological methods to investigate potential effects of Hv1 ligands on other members
of the VGIC family. In aim 2, we will utilize a variety of live cell imaging assays on wild type and Hv1
knockout cells to examine how I.2 ligands inhibit NOX-mediated ROS production in phagocytes and
how they affect proliferation and migration of cancer cells in a Hv1-dependent manner. The Hv1 channel
contains a VSD-VSD interface unique among VGICs. As a result, ligands that bind such interface are
expected to be more specific channel modulators than ligands that bind other transmembrane regions.
The structure of the Hv1 dimer has yet to be determined, and alternative dimer models have been
proposed by different groups with different VSD-VSD interfaces. In aim 3, we will use molecular
dynamics simulations combined with multichemistry cross-linking mass spectrometry to probe the
different models and derive a consensus dimer interface."

Evidence suggests that type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk and progression are associated with gut bacterial imbalance.
Gut microbiome differences are also associated with and thought to contribute to obesity. Obesity is increasingly
prevalent among children with T1D. Notably, obese children progress faster to T1D with reduced insulin
sensitivity compared to their lean counterparts. This is problematic because reduced insulin sensitivity is
associated with higher exogenous insulin needs, chronic inflammation as well as higher risk for hypoglycemia,
dyslipidemia and long-term diabetes complications. It is unknown to what extent the gut microbiome plays a role
in obesity in T1D youth and their worse outcomes. Therefore, profiling and comparing the gut microbiome in T1D
youth who are obese compared to their lean counterparts is important since the microbiome is potentially
modifiable. In adolescents with T1D, metformin use, in addition to insulin therapy, has been shown to reduce
total daily insulin doses as well as improve whole-body and peripheral insulin sensitivity in those who were
overweight and obese. More recently, in adults with type 2 diabetes, it has been shown to exert its effect in part,
by inducing changes in the gut microbiome with secondary changes in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and bile
acid (BA) levels. These changes ultimately affect insulin secretion and sensitivity. However, it is unknown
whether similar effects are seen in T1D youth with obesity. We hypothesize, that children with T1D and
obesity, as compared to their lean counterparts, exhibit differences in their gut microbiome profile and
that metformin adjuvant therapy for 6 months will alter the gut microbiome profile, SCFA production and
composition of the BA pool in obese T1D youth. Our preliminary data supports the presence of differences
in the microbiome in these two groups. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine
differences in the gut microbiome in T1D youth who are lean versus obese and whether these differences are
modifiable. We, therefore, aim to determine: i) the differences in the gut microbiome, SCFA and BA profile in
T1D youth who are lean versus obese, and ii) the effects of metformin treatment on the gut microbiome, SCFA
and BA profile in T1D youth with obesity. My long-term goal is to identify novel treatments to improve disease
management. For aim 1, we will enroll 84 youth with T1D, 42 obese and 42 lean. They will be matched by age,
sex and race. For aim 2, we will prospectively enroll T1D youth enrolled in aim 1 who are obese in a clinical trial
using metformin. We will analyze stool and serum samples using state-of-the-art markers of microbiome profiling,
metagenomics, and metabolomics. We have developed and identified a clear plan and budget to adequately
enroll and analyze samples collected during the funding period. Therefore, this study will allow me to further
develop my research skills in the area of T1D and the gut microbiome, clinical trial development and
implementation and develop new skills related to metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis."

Fibrosis in skeletal muscle is associated with a collection of devastating skeletal muscle wasting disorders
known as the muscular dystrophies. Although fibrosis, per se, is not causal to the muscular dystrophies it is a
significant confounding facet of the disease that contributes to impaired skeletal muscle compliance,
contractility and patient morbidity. In dystrophic skeletal muscle, mutations in structural proteins render the
muscle architecturally unstable resulting in susceptibility to damage, onset of necrosis, inflammation and
repair; the chronicity of which culminates in fibrosis. We have discovered that the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-5 (MKP5), which is a dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase that directly
inactivates p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1/2), is a central mediator of skeletal
muscle fibrosis. MKP5 is overexpressed in mouse models that develop fibrosis, including skeletal muscle from
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy mice and its genetic loss curtails the disease. Mechanistically, MKP5 is
essential for the activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) cascade which is a major pro-fibrogenic
pathway. Activation of p38 MAPK and JNK have been implicated in driving fibrosis. However, our findings
suggest a more complex interplay exists between MKP5-mediated MAPK dephosphorylation and TGF-β
receptor activation in both fibroblasts and muscle. The contribution of MKP5 to regulate TGF-β signaling and
thus fibrosis in these cell types has yet to be explored neither in vivo nor exploited pharmacologically to assess
validity of therapeutic potential. The overarching hypothesis is that MKP5 acts as a critical molecular
checkpoint for fibrotic skeletal muscle disease. In Aim 1, we will define the cell type of action for MKP5 in
skeletal muscle fibrosis by generating tissue-specific knockouts of MKP5. We will test whether MKP5 in either
the myofiber and/or fibroblast contributes to disease progression in models of fibrosis for skeletal muscle. In
Aim 2, we will identify the molecular basis for the actions of MKP5 in fibrosis by defining how it is involved in
mediating the pro-fibrogenic actions of the TGF-β pathway. In Aim 3, we will determine the effectiveness of
MKP5 inhibition as an anti-fibrotic therapy using a novel first-in-class allosteric MKP5 inhibitor. Collectively,
these studies will define the pathophysiological basis for how MKP5 establishes its role as a regulator of
skeletal muscle fibrosis. The successful completion of this project will provide proof-of-principle towards the
notion that MKP5 represents a target for the treatment of fibrosis in dystrophic muscle diseases."
10843236,"The recent emergence and devastating impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) clearly demonstrates that arboviral
emergence continues to defy accurate prediction and exposes our inability to rapidly respond to and control
outbreaks. The medical and veterinary importance of emerging flaviviruses is significantly exacerbated by the
absence of available vaccines, therapeutics, and reliable control measures. Vaccination remains the most
reliable strategy for outbreak prevention and control, but vaccine development intrinsically involves trade-offs
between safety and immunogenicity. This study will develop a platform to overcome these trade-offs by
combining the safety advantages of non-replicating platforms with the rapid and long-lived immunogenicity of a
live-attenuated vaccine. We have developed a unique chimeric virus platform based on a novel insect-specific
flavivirus (ISFV), Aripo virus (ARPV). Preliminary data shows ARPV’s host restriction is noticeably later in the
replication cycle than described for other ISFVs and is capable of entering vertebrate cells and developing a
robust immune response in the absence of genomic replication. An ARPV/ZIKV chimera was developed to test
our hypothesis that ARPV/ZIKV vaccination produces a rapid and robust innate, humoral, and cell-mediated
immune response that elicits sterilizing immunity against subsequent ZIKV challenge. Preliminary studies show
a single dose of ARPV/ZIKV produces a robust adaptive ZIKV-specific immune response that completely
protects mice from viremia, weight loss, and mortality, while demonstrating exceptional safety in vivo. This
platform is superior because of the increased safety of the chimera by virtue of its fundamental replication
defect in vertebrate cells, increased immunogenicity due to a lack of inactivation requirements, and efficient
genome delivery to target cells. This innovative and essential R01 aims to evaluate the safety profile,
protective efficacy and mechanisms underlying the immunogenicity of ARPV/ZIKV vaccination via three aims:
 1. Determine the efficacy of ARPV/ZIKV immunization for preventing ZIKV-induced disease in murine and
 rhesus macaque models.
 2. Elucidate the correlates underlying vaccine-induced protection from ZIKV-induced disease in ARPV/ZIKV
 vaccinated murine models.
 3. Evaluate the safety profile of this vaccine candidate in vitro and in vivo, and elucidate the mechanism
 underlying its immunogenicity.
This study will generate a safe, efficacious, single-dose ZIKV vaccine that will be ideally suited to affordably
control explosive outbreaks, which typically affect resource-limited regions. Our platform’s antigenic superiority
will result in enhanced efficacy, effectively combining the safety of replication-defective virus-like particles or
nucleic acid vaccines with the antigenic superiority, and rapid, long-lived immunogenicity of live-attenuated
vaccines. This platform can also be readily translated to other flaviviruses of human or veterinary importance."

(MGH) Rheumatology/Ragon Institute research group. The group is comprised of clinical investigators from the
MGH Rheumatology Division and basic scientists from both the Ragon Institute and the Center for
Inflammatory and Immunologic Disorders at MGH.
 We have described many of the clinical, pathological, and treatment characteristics of IgG4-RD and
developed instruments to facilitate its study. We have also developed a detailed pathophysiological model and
identified SLAM-F7 as a marker expressed on cells critical to IgG4-RD pathophysiology: a CD4+ cytotoxic T
cell (CTL) and several types of B cells. We have phenotyped this CD4+CTL and the B cells with which it
interacts, building a powerful case for the efficacy of an anti-SLAMF7 approach to treatment. Elotuzumab,
approved in multiple myeloma, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets SLAM-F7. The Primary
Clinical Project is a clinical trial program of elotuzumab in IgG4-RD, linked to robust mechanistic studies.
 Parallel with this work, we have led a worldwide trial of interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) blockade in GCA
that resulted in the worldwide approval of tocilizumab for that disease. Basic studies performed in our
laboratories have demonstrated that GCA patients have an expanded population of inflammatory regulatory
CD4+ T cells (Tregs) in their blood. These cells express markers of effector CD4+ T cells, produce IL-17, and
carry a hypofunctional variant of the master regulatory factor Foxp3. The Alternate Clinical Project is a multi-
center, two-arm, randomized, open-label clinical trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of IL-6 receptor
blockade stepdown versus discontinuation in GCA. Patients will be followed longitudinally with careful clinical
assessments to detect disease flares and capture clinical samples at the time of these events. We will
investigate the roles of Tregs and other T cell subsets in both peripheral blood and at sites of disease.
 The Collaborative Project seek to ask three questions in building on previous work in human
autoimmune fibrosis: Can immune dysregulation that drives autoimmunity be visualized at the site of its
initiation, and can systems biology tools be utilized to quantitatively analyze this dysregulation? Can the entire
gamut of immune cells in a tissue that is the target of autoimmunity be visualized, and immune cells
interrogated visually in granular detail in order to map the relevant cell-cell interactions mapped? Can we use
systems biology approaches in tissues to understand for fully the downstream mechanisms within the end
organs affected by in autoimmune and fibrosis?
 Efforts in this proposed ACE program will be facilitated by: 1) a well-organized, highly-functional ACE

10844404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Women continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS worldwide, but particularly in sub-
Saharan Africa, where nearly 80% of new HIV infections among adolescents are in females. Because of the high
fertility rates in the region, women spend a significant fraction of their reproductive years either pregnant or
breastfeeding. This is relevant because the risk of HIV acquisition among African women increases up to 4-fold
during the gestational and postpartum stages compared to the non-pregnant state. Indeed, the pooled HIV
incidence rates among women who are pregnant or have recently given birth (i.e., puerperal) in sub-Saharan
Africa exceed those for “high risk individuals, such as female sex workers. Additionally, because pregnant and
lactating women continue to be excluded from clinical research, they are unlikely to benefit from the latest anti-
HIV therapies. Given the recent spike in antiretroviral therapy-resistant HIV variants in women and the fact that
some antiretrovirals cannot be safely used during pregnancy, new ways for combating obstetric HIV infection
are urgently needed. Here we will explore the safety and antiviral properties of the antibody-like HIV entry
inhibitor eCD4-Ig during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Because eCD4-Ig emulates the receptor (CD4)
and coreceptors (CCR5 & CXCR4) of primate lentiviruses, it binds avidly to and neutralizes virtually any HIV or
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Env proteins. As a result, eCD4-Ig is broader than any single HIV-specific
broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody described to date. Given these impressive properties, we postulate
that eCD4-Ig can prevent and control obstetric HIV infection. To address this hypothesis, we will tackle four key
questions related to the safety and antiviral properties of eCD4-Ig in pregnant and puerperal female rhesus
macaques (RMs). 1) How do neonatal Fc receptor affinity-enhancing mutations affect the biodistribution and
pharmacokinetics of eCD4-Ig in pregnant RMs? 2) Can passive delivery of eCD4-Ig block vaginal SIV acquisition
in pregnant RMs? 3) Can passive delivery of eCD4-Ig suppress viremia in SIV-infected pregnant RMs? 4) Can
adeno-associated virus-expressed eCD4-Ig block vaginal acquisition of SIVmac239 in puerperal RMs? In sum,
the pre-clinical experiments proposed here will help us gauge the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of eCD4-
Ig for combatting obstetric HIV infection. Importantly, since maternal viremia is a strong predictor of mother-to-
child transmission of HIV, a successful outcome in this project may also contribute to reducing the high rates of
perinatal HIV infection that still plague resource-poor regions."
10844406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have identified a novel property of the cervical spinal cord that modulates respiratory activity, both the rate
and depth of breathing, such that the respiratory drive in opioid-suppressed states in mice and humans
increases during spinal cord epidural stimulation. Respiratory rates are increased upon epidural stimulation of
specific cervical spinal cord locations when there is spontaneous breathing, and rhythmic breathing can be
generated when the respiratory state is depressed and spontaneous breathing is absent. This is an important
observation because the brainstem, which contains the rhythm-generating center for respiration, is a difficult
area for surgical and therapeutic access. If there are other accessible neural regions by surgery (i.e. epidural
stimulation) or non-invasive means (i.e. transcutaneous stimulation), for example in the cervical spine, that
influence respiration or contain their own rhythmic respiratory elements, these may represent potential
therapeutic targets to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. Thus, we have proposed a strategy to
characterize this novel cervical respiratory circuit. First, we will conduct extensive electrical mapping of the
respiratory responsive elements of the cervical spinal cord in mice aided by machine learning strategies, and
we will characterize the mechanistic basis for this response, the relation to opioid receptors to the respiratory
response, and identity neurons responsible for the respiratory response using optogenetic techniques. Guided
by the animal studies, we will then confirm the cervical respiratory responsive loci in humans. Third, we will
subject the identified respiratory competent regions to increasing doses of opioid to further characterize the
dose-response profile of these regions. Fourth, we will assess the feasibility and practical translation of this
strategy to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression in three patients implanted with spinal cord
stimulators. These studies will provide an anatomical and electrophysiological characterization of the
respiratory circuit within the cervical spine and provide practical information for the treatment of opioid-induced
respiratory depression. The results obtained, especially because they are obtained in humans, will have an
immediate translational impact on our understanding of the respiratory circuit that may, in turn, prevent deaths
due to opioid overdose."

10849619,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our OVERALL OBJECTIVE is to clarify the pathogenesis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and identify
new therapies. PSC accounts for 6% of liver transplants, costs ~$125 million annually, affects ~40,000
Americans, has a median survival of ~15 years, and is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and
increased risk of colon, bile duct and gallbladder cancers. There are no regulatory approved drugs for PSC
because its pathogenesis is obscure. We reported that stress-induced cholangiocyte senescence (cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis resistance, bioactive secretome) is a feature of PSC, informing its pathogenesis and revealing
new therapeutic targets. Experiments proposed here extending this observation address the concept that the
cholangiocyte response to injury in PSC is not uniform: some cholangiocytes arrest in the cell cycle (become
senescent) while others acquire a ductular reactive, proliferative phenotype (resist senescence). We discovered
fundamental differences in epigenetic and downstream signaling pathways that influence this binary
cholangiocyte injury response. Our preliminary data show: i) we can isolate enriched subpopulations of
senescent-sensitive and senescent-resistant cholangiocytes with distinct epigenetic signatures from human and
rodent tissue, and from cholangiocyte cell lines; ii) chromatin modifiers, AP1 (transcription factor) and p300
(histone acetyltransferase), establish an epigenetic profile promoting senescence; iii) destabilization of the
effector protooncogene, c-Myc, via the kinase, GSK3, drives senescence and cell-cycle arrest; in contrast,
stabilization of c-Myc via the kinase, AKT, promotes senescence resistance and cholangiocyte proliferation; and
iv) the cholangiocyte subtypes exhibit distinct bioactive secretomes that differentially affect portal fibroblasts
(PF) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). The data support our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that, in PSC, the
cholangiocyte epigenome drives kinase cascades that determine if cholangiocytes develop senescent
or proliferative phenotypes that influence the periductal and bridging fibrogenic responses of PF and
HSC. Our integrated SPECIFIC AIMS test 3 hypotheses. Aim 1 Hypothesis: The epigenetic modifiers, AP1 &
p300, promote open chromatin and active transcription via histone acetylation at senescence-associated
enhancers/promoters and drive cholangiocytes to stress-induced senescence. Aim 2 Hypothesis: The
epigenetic profiles of senescent resistant or sensitive cholangiocytes establish kinase cascades that either
promote proliferation via c-Myc stabilization (AKT) or senescence via c-Myc destabilization (GSK3) and
activation of the senescence effector, ETS1. Aim 3 Hypothesis: Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of c-Myc or
p300 alters the secretomes of proliferative and senescent cholangiocytes, their communication with PF and
HSC, and periductal and bridging fibrosis. Thus, we will clarify how the epigenome determines the cholangiocyte
injury response, how this binary response drives fibrogenesis, and how pharmacologic modification of the
cholangiocyte epigenome can inhibit PSC progression."

Malformation of the biliary system could lead to cholestatic liver diseases, including biliary atresia, the most
common infantile liver disease. A developmental anomaly of the biliary system could lead to biliary atresia and
other cholestatic liver diseases. To understand the genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of biliary
atresia, we undertook a forward genetic screen to identify previously unappreciated genes and pathways
responsible for biliary system formation in zebrafish. We have successfully established new 24 zebrafish
mutants, which specifically affect the biliary system. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
biliary system phenotypes in zebrafish by using our innovative computational algorithms to quantify subtle
differences in three-dimensional biliary branching patterns and utilize machine-learning-based algorithms to
characterize their phenotypes unbiasedly. Building on this work, we will extend our studies to human biliary
atresia and other biliary system disease patient samples to investigate the pathology. Successful execution of
this collaborative scientific endeavor promises to develop important new scientific insights into biliary system
formation. It may have profound implications for our understanding of the pathology of biliary system diseases."

The transcriptional response to drug exposure shapes the ability for a parasite to survive and grow during and
after treatment. During the prior grant period, we developed multiple tools to identify the drivers of drug
resistance. Single cell RNAseq of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses now enables rapid, robust
estimation of single cell expression quantitative trait loci (SCeQTLs) across the parasite life cycle. Pseudo Bulk
Segregant Analysis (pseudoBSA) now enables rapid linking of phenotypic variation to QTLs. We will use these
tools to capture the dynamic response of resistant and sensitive parasites to drug treatment. In Specific Aim 1,
we will define transcriptional networks associated with growth under drug exposure, and with rapid recovery
after treatment. We will identify which loci in the parasite genomes drive drug resistance and recovery using
pseudoBSA. We will identify SCeQTLs that link together drug response to growth and recovery. In concert with
Core B, we will identify high confidence polymorphisms that regulate the transcriptional response to drug
exposure and validate these with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In Specific Aim 2, we will leverage this platform
to identify compensatory mutations relieving the impact of resistance mutations on parasite fitness and
understand their mechanism of action. This will involve novel genetic cross generation with Core A."

The present proposal is a comprehensive five-year training program for the development of an academic
career focused on understanding the relationship between T cell immunity and fibrosis in the cornea.
 I have a strong research background in transplantation immunology and sub-specialty ophthalmology
training in cornea, with a clinical interest in corneal fibrosis. As an Advanced Clinical and Research Cornea
Fellow at Mass. Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School, I have continued my work in corneal transplantation
immunology, demonstrating the presence of fibrosis in T cell-mediated immune rejection of corneal transplants.
Our preliminary data suggest that in corneal transplantation, T cells play a direct role in promoting
myofibroblast formation and fibrosis, and that myofibroblasts are in turn capable of regulating alloreactive T cell
function. This data has laid the foundation for the current research proposal in which we will investigate the
fibrosis-immunity interface in corneal transplantation. In Specific Aim 1 we will define the critical mechanisms
by which effector T cells promote fibrosis and evaluate whether modulation of these mechanisms can prevent
fibrosis and transplant failure in vivo. In Specific Aim 2 we will define the critical mechanisms by which
myofibroblasts suppress effector T cells to restore immune homeostasis. The goal of the proposed research is
to investigate these fundamental mechanisms and ultimately develop novel therapeutic strategies for the
prevention of graft fibrosis and suppression of T cell immunity in organ transplantation.
 Dr. Reza Dana, a world expert in corneal immunology with a long track-record of fostering the career
development of clinician-scientists will serve as my primary mentor, and I will additionally have the support of
an advisory team composed of independent NIH-funded scientists, each with extensive experience in
mentoring young researchers. The proposed research and career development programming will take place at
the Schepens Eye Research Institute/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School, and I
will have full access to the significant resources of these institutions.
 I am committed to a career as a clinician-scientist, with the over-arching goal being to translate my
basic science investigations into novel approaches for addressing the unmet needs of patients. The K08 grant
proposal detailed here addresses an important and previously unexplored area of corneal pathophysiology
while simultaneously providing me the mentorship, resources and academic foundation needed to become an
independent clinician-scientist."
10862808,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite its putative link to many mental illnesses, Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) represents a
relatively unexplored mechanism for regulating mRNA stability in brain function. NMD functions in a tissue-,
cell type- and cell-state specific manner and modulates stability of selective mRNAs to fine-tune transcript
abundance. There is dearth of knowledge regarding the identity of such NMD target RNAs, particularly in cells
in their normal in vivo context. A particularly large gap in the field is the cell-specific function and targets
of NMD in vivo. Our recent work has established that neuronal NMD regulates GLUR1 signaling and is
required for proper synaptic plasticity, cognition, and local protein synthesis in dendrites, providing fundamental
insight into the neuron-specific function of NMD within the brain. To date, no study has reported a specific
function for NMD nor identified NMD substrates within glial cells in the brain. Astroglial control of synaptic
activity translates into regulation of cognition making astrocytes a novel therapeutic target to treat cognitive
dysfunctions. However, the mechanisms through which astrocytes regulate neuronal function are not well
understood. Currently, it is not known whether mRNA degradation in astrocytes contribute to the regulation of
synaptic plasticity and behavior. The goal of this application is to determine the contribution of astrocytic
NMD to synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. Several predicted ‘canonical’ and ‘atypical’ NMD
targets are expressed in astrocytes. Our gene ontology analysis of these predicted NMD targets identified
molecular function enrichment for Ca2+ signaling. Consistent with this, we have found that disruption of NMD in
astrocytes resulted in elevated Ca2+ activity in vitro. Dynamic Ca2+ transients in astrocytes have been
suggested to control proper basal synaptic transmission and modulate hippocampal LTP. We have also found
that conditional ablation of NMD in astrocytes impaired memory in the adult mice. Based on the published
literature and our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that NMD regulates Ca2+ activity in astrocytes, and
astrocytic NMD is required for proper cognitive function and behavior in the adult brain. To test this
hypothesis, we propose to determine 1) whether NMD is required for different aspects of learning and memory
2) the effects of astrocytic NMD ablation on neurons (e.g., assessing neuronal network connectivity and
synaptic plasticity) and 3) functional deficits of NMD-deficient astrocytes (i.e., by assessing Ca2+ activity in vivo)
and in vivo NMD targets in astrocytes. We will use a combination of techniques including an inducible-genetic
mouse model, behavioral assays, electrophysiology, live-animal Ca2+ imaging by two-photon microscopy,
stereotaxic viral labeling, Multielectrode Array Assay, in vivo RNAseq/bioinformatics, and in vivo HITS-CLIP.
The successful completion of this research will provide a coherent view of how cell-specific mRNA degradation
underlies the highly regulated synaptic and cognitive function in the mammalian brain and might be valuable
for providing new insights into the astrocytic mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction and neurocognitive diseases."
10862810,"ABSTRACT
Transient Receptor Vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) and its close relative TRPV5 are Ca2+ selective epithelial ion
channels. The membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is the
endogenous ligand of these channels that is required for their activity. These channels also undergo
Ca2+-induced inactivation which is mediated by binding of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) to the channel.
TRPV6 and TRPV5 are constitutively active, and their level of activity is determined by the balance
between the activating PI(4,5)P2 and the inhibitory CaM. In the previous funding period, we identified
the PI(4,5)P2 binding site in TRPV6 using homology modeling and site directed mutagenesis, which
was essentially identical to the experimentally determined PI(4,5)P2 binding site in the closely related
TRPV5. CryoEM structures for CaM and TRPV6 or TRPV5 also became available, showing a highly
consistent picture of one CaM molecule binding to the channel tetramer, and blocking the pore in a
fashion consistent with our experimental results. An important development during the previous
funding period was the finding that loss of function mutations in TRPV6 are associated with chronic
pancreatitis. The likely mechanism is reduced Ca2+ removal from pancreatic fluid in the acini or the
ducts leading to increased Ca2+ and premature activation of pancreatic digestive enzymes. Given the
crucial role of Ca2+ in digestive enzyme activation, small molecules that increase the activity of
TRPV6 can, in principle, be used as novel therapeutic approach to treat pancreatitis. The overall goal
of this application is to gain molecular insight into how the two key endogenous regulators PI(4,5)P2
and CaM gate TRPV6 and to use our molecular level understanding of their regulation to identify
small molecules that increase their activity. We will use a combination of computational and
experimental approaches to decipher the molecular mechanism of PI(4,5)P2 activation of TRPV6 and
TRPV5 in Aim1, to determine the relationship between CaM and PI(4,5)P2 regulation of TRPV6 in
Aim 2, and to identify small molecules that increase TRPV6 and/or TRPV5 activity by interfering with
CaM inhibition in Aim 3. This work will further our understanding of TRPV6 and TRPV5 gating, and
small molecules that enhance the activity of TRPV6 or TRPV5 can be used in future experiments to
explore the possibility of using this approach to treat or prevent pancreatitis and kidney stones."
10859351,"Molecular regulation of fluid pressure homeostasis in the inner ear
Project Summary
A significant portion of hearing and balance disorders are caused by the unregulated accumulation of
endolymph fluid and pressure within the inner ear. A key challenge in treating these diseases of elevated
endolymph pressure is identifying new strategies to regain pressure homeostasis. We previously discovered a
tissue-scale pressure relief valve in the epithelial tissue of the endolymphatic sac whose behavior is consistent
with long observed physiologies that lacked explanations. Despite its importance in maintaining an internal
environment within the ear, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the endolymphatic sac forms and
functions remain unclear. The long-term goal of this research is to define how molecular signals during
development and during homeostasis control the pressure relief valve's setpoint. Using a combination of
advanced live imaging, genetics, and cell and molecular biological technologies like genome editing, we study
these systemic processes in zebrafish embryos and larvae whose inner ears are optically accessible in the
living animal instead of buried within the temporal bone as in mice and humans. Our prior generation of a
single-cell gene expression atlas of the zebrafish inner ear identified molecular leads of signaling pathways in
the endolymphatic sac. Synthesis with past work motivates our central hypothesis which posits that cells within
the endolymphatic duct maintain a strong adhesive interaction, while adhesion strength at distinct subsets of
cell-cell interfaces in the endolymphatic sac is reduced by adhesion protein turnover. This regulatory
mechanism allows these interfaces to temporarily separate, facilitating the release of excessive pressure. We
will pursue how the integration of molecular signals regulates these local cell behaviors to determine the
pressure setpoint within the entire inner ear. First, we will determine how regulation of spatiotemporal
differences in Wnt signaling regulate turnover rates of cell-cell adhesion complexes in subregions of the
endolymphatic duct and sac. Second, we will determine the molecular responses in the endolymphatic sac that
are regulated by vasopressin and how these responses integrate into physiological circuits. Third, we will
determine how mechanical and calcium signals contribute to tissue contractions in the endolymphatic sac to
regulate resistance to stretch. These studies will uncover regulatory mechanisms that determine the inner ear's
pressure setpoint that are essential for our ability to sense sound for hearing and body acceleration for
balance."
10863338,"Project Summary/Abstract – Data Management Core
A well-functioning Data Management Core (DMC) is essential to the success of the UCI Vaccines for Pandemic
Preparedness Center (VPPC). DMC provides shared informatics infrastructures and rigid data integrity oversight
that are key to the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of VPPC’s data generation and management
processes. DMC also plays an indispensable role in ensuring all digital assets created by VPPC conform fully to
the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) guiding principles so they can be readily
shared with the scientific community to accelerate discovery and results translation. Such digital assets include
not only the data generated by the Center, but also the associated metadata, documentation, and algorithms
and software code.
 The UCI VPPC DMC, described in this proposal, is committed to working with all VPPC Scientific Cores and
Research Projects to implement a consortium-wide Strategy for Management of Data Activities Plan and
operationalize the strategy through the establishment of data policies, shared informatics infrastructures, and
standard operating procedures (SOP). DMC will also develop automated data transformation and quality control
pipelines to minimize errors and maximize conformity to the data and interoperability standards specified by the
ReVAMPP Coordinating and Data Sharing Center (CDSC). We will work closely with CDSC to ensure high-
quality and timely transfer of data to the ReVAMPP Network, as well as collate information to promptly respond
to inquiries from CDSC or NIAID program staff regarding the Center’s compliance with network-wide timelines
and network data sharing policies.
 The work to be performed by DMC will largely leverage UCI’s existing research computing resources to
reduce redundancy, improve cost-effectiveness, and enable centralized data management and oversight. We
will assist each Scientific Core and Research Project in designing custom informatics solutions optimized for
their data storage and computing needs. We will coordinate with the Administrative Core to deploy software
systems to facilitate consortium-wide project management, and with the Regulatory Science Core to implement
the regulatory-enabling Total Quality Management System (TQMS) at each step of the data lifecycle (i.e.,
acquisition, transformation, storage, analysis, sharing, and archiving) to improve regulatory readiness of our
vaccine candidates to enable rapid response, approval, and deployment. The proposed DMC activities will be
organized under the following 3 specific aims—Aim 1: To provide shared informatics infrastructures to facilitate
centralized management of all data activities of VPPC; Aim 2: To implement standard operating procedures and
automated data transformation and quality control pipelines to ensure data integrity and regulatory readiness;
and Aim 3: To enforce conformity to data and interoperability standards specified by CDSC and prepare timely
data submissions to the ReVAMPP Network."
10863339,"Project Summary/Abstract - Regulatory Science Core
 Establishing early a regulatory-enabling research framework is essential for the successful translation of
promising target biomedical discoveries especially targeted to the next “Disease X” and respond to the 100 Days
Mission (100DM) as well as ASPR Next of the US government. For vaccines and therapeutics, such a framework
would accelerate the technology transfer of novel and promising candidates into the manufacturing and
toxicology testing stages and would ensure robust preclinical data packages used in the compilation of regulatory
dossiers to initiate the clinical testing. A Consortium-wide Regulatory Science Core, aligned and integrated with
the other cores, especially the Data Management Core, will be created to prepare, guide, assess and ensure
that all research and development (R&D) efforts of the consortium projects are embedded in a regulatory-
enabling and Total Quality Management System (TQMS) environment supporting the rapid translation and
readiness of new vaccine candidates towards their suitability for technology transfer to GMP pilot manufacturers,
GLP toxicology testing and prepare a smooth adaptation to seek regulatory approval for their entry into clinical
trials. The expectation is that having access to such a core, the grant R&D efforts will result in high-quality vaccine
prototypes with robust preclinical data packages leading to efficient and rapid transitions into manufacturing and
toxicology testing and accelerating regulatory approvals for the entry into the clinic. The Regulatory Science
Core will have the following aims: 1) Establish a consortium-wide regulatory-enabling TQMS adapted to the
needs of the consortium to accelerate the development timelines of the novel vaccine prototypes. Briefly, an
initial landscape assessment will give insights of the levels of regulatory-enabling and quality processes and
tools used by consortium members. Subsequently, a set of standardized and harmonized templates and tools
will be generated for consortium use and lastly a digital cloud-based document control system to centralize and
archive documents will be created; and 2) Monitor and evaluate consortium-wide quality improvements by
establishing a plan for continuous monitoring and evaluation of the TQMS and strengthen the consortium
performance, time management and pre-investigational new drug (pre-IND) Go/NoGo decision points and be
more efficient in achieving the project milestones. A continuous and sustainable quality learning environment will
build self-reliance and self-sufficiency thus become better prepared for any emerging pandemic. Overall,
including a regulatory science core in this proposal is the generation of a comprehensive system that enables
and is aligned with regulatory requirements such that the novel vaccine candidates emerging from this
consortium can be ready to advance into the critical phases of development if an emerging pandemic caused by
one of these viruses were to occur."
10863340,"Project Summary/Abstract – Translational Immunology Core
There are several virus families with serious pandemic potential but for which we currently have no effective
vaccines. Development of new vaccines (and new vaccine technologies) against these infectious diseases will
be critical for protecting Americans, and the world, from future pandemics. A major challenge in vaccine
development is assessing the translational potential of a candidate from small animal models to larger animal
models and humans. Unfortunately, most vaccines that show protection in mice do not result in protection when
tested in human clinical trials. To help de-risk these translational steps and establish mechanisms of protection
across multiple animal and in vitro models, the translational immunology core will collect comprehensive
immunogenicity and safety data in non-human primates (NHP) and test vaccine candidates for the ability to
stimulate human adaptive immune responses in an organoid model. We hypothesize that establishing correlates
of protection and detailed mechanistic data from multiple sources (murine immunogenicity and challenge data,
non-human primate immunogenicity and challenge data, and human immune organoids) will accelerate the
identification of common features that promote protective immunity in humans. The goal of the Translational
Immunology Core will be to support each of the individual projects by testing the most promising vaccine
candidates in non-human primates (Aim 1) and a human immune organoid model (Aim 2). We will conduct deep
serum antibody profiling from both NHP and human cohorts (Aim 3). We will collect comprehensive
immunogenicity and reactogenicity data in a rhesus macaque cohort, including dosing, overall animal health,
and innate and adaptive immune measurements. Lymphoid tissues from immunized animals will also be used
for in vitro immune organoid testing. In Aim 2, NHP and human lymphoid tissues will be stimulated (or
restimulated) with vaccine candidates in vitro and numerous metrics of productive adaptive immune responses,
including B and T cell activation, germinal center activity, and antibody magnitude, breadth, avidity, and function
will be established. The novelty of this core lies in our systems immunology approach to integrate health,
serological, phenotypic, functional, and repertoire readouts in well-controlled platforms. Completion of the
proposed experiments will help us rapidly identify correlates of protection and guide the design and refinements
of novel vaccines against Bunyaviruses, Paramyxoviruses, and Picornaviruses and directly contribute to and
support the individual projects in this proposal."
10837756,"At the cellular level Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded and damaged
proteins. Prominent species that accumulate early and play fundamental roles in disease pathogenesis are
Amyloid β (Aβ), Tau, and sometimes α-synuclein (α-syn). A vast body of literature supports the notion that the
cell’s protein degradation systems do not function sufficiently enough in AD to clear these misfolded proteins.
The cell’s primary system for the degradation of such misfolded or damaged proteins is the Ubiquitin
Proteasome System (UPS). We have recently found that pathologically relevant oligomeric forms of Aβ, Tau,
and α-syn can potently and directly inhibit isolated 20S and 26S proteasomes, even inhibiting ubiquitin-
dependent protein degradation in vitro. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that such pathological
oligomers contribute to AD pathogenesis by directly inhibiting proteasome function in neurons. What we do
not know is if proteasome inhibition by such oligomers can cause AD related neuronal dysfunction,
nor do we know the molecular mechanisms involved. We propose to fill this gap in knowledge by 1)
elucidating the precise mechanism of proteasome inhibition by these oligomers in vitro and in vivo 2)
generating proteasomes that are hyper-active or resistant to inhibitory oligomers and 3) testing if hyper-active
or oligomer resistant proteasomes can rescue neuronal function in cellular and animal models of AD. Our
proposal is innovative because we have generated highly novel animal model and preliminary data that
supports a novel mechanistic hypotheses, which addresses a fundamental component of AD. Extending these
studies will allow us to generate disease resistant proteasomes allowing us to conclusively determine if direct
proteasome impairment by AD related oligomers can cause neuronal dysfunction. This contribution is
significant because it will fill a gap in our knowledge by demonstrating that the pathological oligomers
associated with AD cause neuronal dysfunction, at least in part, by directly inhibiting the proteasome. In
addition, this study will also demonstrate if proteasome activation can protect neurons from AD related
proteotoxicities. These outcomes are expected to have a positive impact because they demonstrate that the
proteasome is a prime therapeutic target to treat Alzheimer’s disease and provides a precise molecular
mechanism that can be exploited for pharmacological development."
10837877,"Project Summary
While the bradykinetic and akinetic symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are clearly linked to the degeneration
of substantia nigra dopaminergic (SN DAergic) neurons1-3, the mechanisms that underlie the emergence and
escalation of basal ganglia circuit and motor dysfunction remain poorly defined. Degeneration of SN DAergic
neurons long precedes the expression of symptoms in PD4-6. At the point of diagnosis ~50-75% of nigrostriatal
DAergic axons and ~30% of SN DAergic neurons no longer express DA cell markers or have been lost7,8, arguing
for an extensive prodromal period, masked by compensatory mechanisms9-25. As degeneration proceeds,
increasingly dysregulated activity24,26-41 and maladaptive plasticity13-24 within the indirect pathway may
progressively degrade basal ganglia computation, leading to motor deficits17,18,26-28,36-40. This circuit
pathophysiology has also been suggested as an additional source of bioenergetic stress in SN DAergic neurons
that could accelerate their degeneration42-47. Although plausible, these concepts cannot be rigorously studied in
acute toxin models that mimic the absence of DA in advanced PD but not the spatiotemporal pattern of DAergic
neuron degeneration in patients48,49. To fill this gap, we propose to examine the emergence of parkinsonism and
its impact of indirect pathway function in the MitoPark model of PD50. MitoPark mice are generated through
genetic deletion of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM in DAergic neurons, which
causes mitochondrial dysfunction50-52, a consistent vulnerability of these cells in familial and sporadic forms of
PD53-58. These mice recapitulate key aspects of PD, including: 1) progressive SN DAergic neuron degeneration
and levodopa-sensitive motor deficits, but within a compressed, experimentally tractable time frame spanning 6-
7 months50,51,59; 2) relative susceptibility of SN DAergic neuron axon terminals in the dorsal striatum in the initial
stages of parkinsonism50,52,59-61; 3) relative susceptibility of SN versus ventral tegmental area DAergic
neurons50,51,59; 4) circuit plasticity and pathophysiology analogous to that in advanced PD and its models (pilot
data). Using in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, 2-photon imaging,
electrochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) determine
the mechanisms responsible for the retention of indirect pathway and motor function in prodromal MitoPark mice;
2) determine the mechanisms underlying progressive indirect pathway and motor dysfunction in symptomatic
MitoPark mice; 3) determine whether motor dysfunction and degeneration of SN DAergic neurons can be
rescued in symptomatic MitoPark mice by chemogenetically manipulating indirect pathway activity. Through the
execution of this research, we will learn why aspects of basal ganglia indirect pathway function are initially
resilient to but ultimately dysregulated by degeneration of SN DAergic neurons, and whether chemogenetic
indirect pathway manipulation is an effective symptomatic and/or disease-modifying therapy for parkinsonism."
10836690,"Abstract
Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during primary HIV infection leads to clear public health benefits by
preventing onward HIV transmissions. However, it is not clear how the timing of early ART initiation affects
longer-term individual outcomes, such as chronic immune activation. Chronic immune activation during HIV
infection leads to immune dysregulation and exhaustion that contributes to disease progression and other clinical
problems. Heightened immune activation continues even after ART suppresses viral loads below the limit of
detection. Our group previously demonstrated that one pathway involved in immune activation, expression of
interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), is persistently upregulated during untreated and treated HIV infection.
Building on those results, we hypothesize that (1) effective antiretroviral treatment does not completely reverse
chronic ISG activation in people living with HIV, (2) chronic activation of the IFN system will be lower in people
with HIV (PWH) who started ART early, and (3) higher IFN system activation correlates with a larger proviral
reservoir. Identifying ISG pathways that remain elevated following several years of ART could identify targets for
preventing or treating co-occurring inflammatory and degenerative diseases, which are increasing in prevalence
as more and more PWH have remained on ART for decades.
 To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use a highly unique set of archived samples, with longitudinal
samples from individuals prior to HIV infection, during primary infection, and after treatment initiation. These
samples come from a study of early ART initiation in which 1) individuals without HIV were followed monthly with
serology and RNA testing to detect HIV infections shortly after acquisition, and 2) participants diagnosed with HIV
were randomized to begin ART immediately or to defer ART for 24 weeks. They were followed with frequent visits
and sample collections for up to 4 years. In the proposed study, we will measure expression of ISGs in 40
participants (20 from each ART arm) before HIV infection, after HIV diagnosis but before ART and at 6, 30 and 48
months after ART is started. Using these data, we will determine whether ISG expression remains elevated after
48 months of ART relative to pre-infection samples from the same participant. Second, we will evaluate if
reduction of ISG expression following ART is different among those in the immediate vs. the deferred ART
initiation arms. Lastly, we will assess whether ISG activation correlates with the size of the latent HIV reservoir, as
has been suggested by animal models but remains unknown in humans."
10860162,"The brain and immune system are fueled by energy flow through mitochondria – dynamic, multifunctional
organelles that convert energy and act as intracellular signaling hubs within neural, glial, and immune cells.
Converging lines of research indicate that mitochondrial alterations likely arise with aging and play a causal role
in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, progress in testing this hypothesis with a sufficient
level of rigor and specificity has been hindered by the lack of approaches to address the diversity of mitochondrial
phenotypes among different tissues and cell types. To profile multiple AD-relevant aspects of mitochondrial
biology at a sufficient level of biological specificity, we have developed a simple computational approach that
groups all known mitochondrial genes into functional pathways, measures their relative expression using omics
data (RNA sequencing), and yields a fine-grained, interpretable picture of mitochondrial phenotypes – termed
mitotypes. In this proposal, we deploy our mitotyping approach at single-cell resolution in two organ systems
implicated in AD pathogenesis: the brain and immune system. In Aim 1, we propose to generate sensitive
mitotype profiles for >1.4M brain cortical cells (neurons, glia, other cell types) across 381 older adults. This will
establish cell type-specific mitochondrial recalibrations associated with age, among women and men, and allow
the discovery of specific mitotype signatures associated with cognitive reserve and AD. In Aim 2, we deploy the
same approach in >0.9M circulating immune cells from 175 adults ages 20-80, establishing sex-specific immune
mitotypes associated with age, cognitive reserve, and AD. Computationally, brain and immune mitotypes are
entirely compatible, therefore allowing us to harmonize datasets from both cohorts to identify potential shared
abnormal mitochondrial features across the brain and immune cells in persons with cognitive impairment,
dementia, and/or AD. Mechanistically, among the various domains of mitochondrial biology, previous research
has specifically, but not exclusively, implicated defects in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, in Aim 3 we use i) our Cellular Lifespan system to dissect the effects of targeted
genetic and pharmacological OxPhos perturbations on mitotype signatures in living human cells over time, ii) a
co-culture system to examine how a mitochondrial OxPhos impairment in one cell population influences the
mitotype of another cell population, revealing new principles of mitotype crosstalk or “contagion” between cells;
and iii) a unique cohort of patients with genetically-defined, bioenergetically-profiled mitochondrial OxPhos
defects to examine, in the human brain-body system, how OxPhos defects influence other domains of
mitochondrial biology as reflected in circulating immune cell mitotypes. Finally, in Aim 4 we develop an online
platform, MitotypeExplorer 2.0, which makes mitotyping accessible to the growing community of neuroscientists,
immunologists, and other interdisciplinary investigators interested in uncovering the role of age-related
mitochondrial impairments and recalibrations in human health and disease."

of low back pain, spine and knee OA in patient oriented research. The current application requests funding (50% salary
support) for 5 years to support the protected time necessary to conduct the proposed patient oriented research and to
expand opportunities for mentoring within the Duke University. This protected time will allow Dr. Goode to continue to
lead a productive research group and maintain minimal teaching and administrative responsibility at the Departmental and
University levels. As part of this application Dr. Goode will advance his epidemiological and mechanistic expertise by
combining these areas with incorporating real world data to understand the health care utilization along with the transition
from acute to chronic low back pain. There are plentiful opportunities to expand the work Dr. Goode has begun, and
extremely high potential for clinical break-through in this important area of clinical research."
10838474,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), now considered a medical error, remain a significant
contributor to healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and associated morbidity and mortality. Despite ongoing
initiatives to adopt or adhere to specific recommendations and increased use of antibiotic impregnated
catheters, the incidence trend for CLABSIs has remained flat or increasing. The underlying pathophysiology is
related to biofilm formation on catheter surfaces which offer significant protection from host response and
antimicrobial therapy. Thus, definitive therapy often requires removal and replacement of catheters. However,
the patients at greatest risk for CLABSI (i.e., hemodialysis patients) also have high risk associated with
catheter replacement owing to: limited other vascular access points; life-sustaining nature of hemodialysis; and
significant co-morbidity increasing complication risk of instrumentation procedures. Our long-term goal is to
develop an effective catheter salvage strategy that removes biofilms from catheters in situ in patients whose
condition precludes device removal and replacement. We have found that modest elevations in temperature:
(1) soften biofilms, making them more likely to be mechanically dispersed; (2) reduce the total biomass from a
surface; and (3) augment antibiotic killing of constituent bacteria within a biofilm. Our preliminary data also
show that biomass dispersed by heat retains significant viability that can be completely mitigated by traditional
antibiotics. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we have shown that in-and-out cycling of a heated perfusate
reduces catheter-adhered biomass in a rat model of CLABSI. This work suggests that the application of heat
in conjunction with antibiotics is a promising catheter-salvage treatment strategy that could be quickly
translated to clinical practice. The objective of this study is to optimize the treatment parameters for the
application of heat and antibiotics for in situ CLABSI therapy in preparation for phase 1 human clinical trials.
We hypothesize that the addition of heat in combination with catheter lock and system antibiotics will reduce
bacterial load on the catheter and systemic dissemination. Our aims are to: (1) Determine the dose and
duration of heat therapy that maximizes biofilm dispersal and minimizes thermal injury; (2) Define a
generalizable description of the heat delivery required for biofilm eradication to allow translation from the rat to
the human setting; and (3) Determine the appropriate antibiotic regimen to be used in combination with the
heat therapy developed in Aim 1. Completion of these aims will provide a robust description of the heat flux
required to achieve biofilm eradication without thermal injury and the parameters required to administer that
treatment in a human dialysis catheter infection application. These parameters will form the basis for future
phase 1 clinical testing."
10849197,"NISTP: NEUROIMAGING SCIENCES TRAINING PROGRAM
This institutional grant requests funds for six postdoctoral positions for interdisciplinary training and research in
neuroimaging. Two general classes of neuroimaging will be emphasized: radiotracer and nuclear magnetic
resonance. The specific imaging methods are described by the following acronyms: PET (positron emission
tomography, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), including fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and
DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), and MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). These imaging methodologies
offer real promise for the expanded clinical utility of neuroimaging in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and
understanding of the pathophysiology of substance misuse and dependence. However, these new
methodologies typically derive from complex, multidisciplinary sciences, which thereby create a challenging
information barrier to their further development and application in biomedical research. The purposes of the
proposed program are the following:
- Provide formal course training to postdoctoral fellows, with an emphasis on imaging and clinical research
methodology, and instruction in their underlying multidisciplinary sciences.
- Provide mentored training for fellows to apply these new methods to the interdisciplinary advance of our
understanding of the function of the brain in health, substance misuse, and other psychiatric diseases.
- Provide an integrated research experience for the fellows both in imaging applications and in methodology.
All postdoctoral fellows will be expected to complete at least one research project with an applications mentor
and one with a methodology mentor during their training period.
The integration of training in methodology and imaging applications will be enhanced by the organization of this
program as two interactive tracks of approximately equal size: Methodology and Application. We expect that
the majority of postdoctoral fellows in the Methodology track will have Ph.D. degrees, and those in the
Application track, primarily M.D. degrees or Ph.D. in neurosciences or behavioral sciences. Each fellow will
have a primary and secondary faculty mentor to represent the two tracks."

10860512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer death in the US. The 5-year rate of cancer recurrence and death
remains high, even for patients with early tumors. An incomplete understanding of the molecular and
physical underpinnings of early tumor progression limits advances in treatment. The long-term goal is to
identify the fundamental mechanical and biochemical interactions that control the progression of early
lesions to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The overall objective here is to elucidate the mechanical
interactions involved in LUAD progression. The central hypothesis is that increased strain functions in a
feedforward loop with tumor growth and ECM deposition to promote LUAD progression. This is based on
our preliminary data. We computationally predict that strain from respiration is increased at the tumor
edge. We also show that the tumor edge has increased proliferative signaling and is surrounded by
alveolar deformation indicative of circumferential strain. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Determine how strain controls early lung tumor growth, 2) Identify mechanical
factors that modulate invasive progression, and 3) Determine how fibrotic ECM deposition controls the
progression of pre-cancerous lung adenomas. Under the first aim, we will test if strain induces activation
of tumor growth signaling at the tumor edge, thereby expanding the area of amplified strain. In aim 2, we
will test if alveolar wall strains induced by tumor expansion leads to wall failure, the initial step invasive
progression. In aim 3, we test if fibrotic stiffening of the lung causes higher strain amplitudes at the tumor
edge, which promotes LUAD progression. This will determine the physical mechanisms that contribute to
the progression of benign adenomas to lung cancer progression. The research proposed in this
application is innovative, because it tests a new model: strain-mediated mechanobiological signaling in
early lung cancer progression and because it employs new approaches to stretch live lung tissue and
quantify strain and tissue damage and a novel specimen-specific computational modeling and simulation
pipeline to determine the contribution of strain to the growth and invasion of early LUAD. The proposed
research is significant because it will provide new knowledge of how biomechanical signaling, such as
excessive strain and fibrosis, contributes to early cancer progression. Such knowledge has the potential
to provide strong scientific justification for the study of mechanobiology in other solid tumors that
metastasize to the lung and the development of neoadjuvant therapies to reduce fibrosis to limit lung
cancer progression and mortality. Our new approaches to modeling will be implemented in the open
source FEBio software, and the suite of subject-specific models will be distributed via the FEBio model
repository, facilitating innovation by other scientists."
10831020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in young
children worldwide and is also a major cause of morbidity and some mortality in the elderly and
immunocompromised. No approved RSV vaccine exists. Our goal is to utilize a structure-guided design
approach to rationally engineer RSV G protein immunogens that induce robust and protective immunity against
RSV. RSV G protein is one of two major immunogenic proteins on the RSV surface and has key roles in virus
attachment to airway epithelial cells and virus modulation of innate immune defenses. RSV G protein is the
target of neutralizing and protective antibodies. The G protein as a vaccine immunogen has been hampered by
poor immunogenicity and by a paucity of structural information on its epitopes. In this proposal, we will test our
central hypothesis that engineered multimeric RSV G immunogens that display protective conformational
epitopes will elicit robust and protective RSV immunity. We will use an integrated approach to pursue four
specific aims: (1) Use structural studies to define conserved RSV G protein epitopes recognized by protective
antibodies, (2) Use structure-guided design to engineer multimeric RSV G protein immunogens, (3) Evaluate
engineered RSV G protein immunogens for improved immunogenicity, and (4) Use a comprehensive immune
analysis to evaluate RSV G protein CCD immunogens for balanced cytokine responses and protective
antibodies made in response to vaccination. The proposed research will generate RSV G vaccine immunogens
as candidates with demonstrated efficacy in preventing RSV infection and disease pathogenesis."
10862609,"Actomyosin contractility is a central regulator of cell polarity, cell shape and tissue mechanics in development,
physiology and disease. Dysregulation of actomyosin organization can lead to cancer and birth defects, such as
neural tube defects (NTD), heart defects and hereditary deafness. Thus, understanding how actomyosin
contractility generates both the physical forces and mechanosensitive signaling to coordinate cell behaviors is
of both fundamental and medical importance. The conserved Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway has been
implicated in mechano-sensing and orientation of cell polarity within the tissue plane during vertebrate tissue
morphogenesis. In addition, our work has identified an essential, parallel PCP signaling pathway mediated by
Ptk7, a pseudo-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that lacks kinase activity. Live imaging of neural convergent
extension movements in mouse embryos has revealed that, while core PCP pathway components regulate apical
junction remodeling, Ptk7 is required for planar polarization of neural plate cells during neural tube
morphogenesis. Ptk7 signals to Src family kinases (SFKs) to modulate actomyosin contractility at epithelial cell
contacts. However, the signal transduction mechanisms by which Ptk7 controls planar polarity are poorly
understood. To fill this significant knowledge gap, we will use multidisciplinary approaches combining
biochemistry, mouse genetics, including a CRISPR-generated Ptk7 allelic series, and fluorescence imaging of
cytoskeletal, junction and Rho GTPase signaling dynamics in neural plate cells in intact live mouse embryos.
Based on a strong foundation of preliminary data, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Ptk7 imparts planar polarity
through RTK-like conformational changes, using conformation-specific anti-Ptk7 antibodies, PCP signaling
assays, and Ptk7 knockin mouse mutants carrying human NTD-associated variants or predicted allosteric
mutations. Aims 2 and 3 will test whether the cell polarity protein Par3, a junction-associated Angiomotin-Merlin
complex, and the transcription factors Yap1/Taz mediate mechanotransduction in the developing neural tube
downstream of Ptk7, using conditional mouse mutants, PCP signaling assays and live imaging of cellular and
cytoskeletal dynamics. By correlating neural tube, cytoskeletal and cell behavior defects in these mutants, we
will be able to tease apart the contributions of distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms, including apical
junction remodeling, polarized basal protrusive activities and apical constriction of neural epithelial cells, to the
complex process of neural tube formation.
A long-term objective of this work is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how cells integrate actomyosin
contractility and intra- and inter-cellular signaling in space and time during neural tube morphogenesis. In
addition, the proposed work will generate new insights into mechanisms of action of pseudo-RTKs and the
etiology of human neural tube defects."
10862615,"Although there is clear evidence that individual racism experiences can have negative effects on mental
health, few studies have examined structural racism and discrimination (SRD) as a determinant of mental
health, nor have studies examined the mechanisms by which structural racism undermines mental health.
This project will elucidate: (i) neurophysiological stress mechanisms by which SRD impacts mental health;
and (ii) sociocultural factors that influence the impact of SRD on mental health during the transition to
adulthood. The central hypothesis is that SRD will predict poor mental health by impacting neurophysiological
stress systems, while individual, family, and sociocultural factors will moderate the impact of structural racism
on neurophysiology and mental health. This hypothesis will be tested across three specific aims: 1) Determine
the associations between organizational/institutional, neighborhood/community, and societal indicators of
SRD (e.g., residential segregation, discriminatory lending practices, school disciplinary and criminal justice
practices, proximity to racist statues) and mental health by measuring aspects of SRD at the level of state,
neighborhood, and census tract; 2) Elucidate neurophysiological stress mechanisms linking SRD and mental
health at three levels: corticolimbic, autonomic, and immune; and 3) Identify individual vulnerability (i.e.,
chronic exposure to poverty and violence) and family, cultural, and community resilience factors (e.g., racial
identity, racial socialization, religious involvement) that moderate the SRD-mental health link. We will test
these associations in a sample of 850 young adults from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. This
ongoing study of children born to families from predominantly low-income backgrounds has multiple scientific
strengths: 1) Children were assessed at birth, 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 21, and 22 years; 2) The sample is representative
of children born in large cities with considerable variation across cities in segregation and criminal justice
policy and implementation; and 3) Participants are entering early adulthood, a critical developmental period of
increased risk for poor mental health outcomes. By identifying these SRD-mental health pathways using multi-
level (i.e., individual, institutional, and cultural racism) and multi-domain (i.e., organization/institutional,
neighborhood/community, societal) indicators of racism across diverse geographic units, with multiple
measures of neurophysiology, and measurement of sociocultural resilience factors in a 22-year longitudinal
birth cohort sample, the study will provide a strong evidence-base to inform new opportunities for structural
and therapeutic interventions to decrease structural racism, eliminate racial health disparities, and promote
health equity."

The sense of taste is important for nutrition and quality of life. Taste buds on the anterior
tongue connect to the chorda tympani (CT) nerve, which transmits taste information to the brain.
CT axons maintain adult taste bud structure and function, but trauma, infection, and ear surgery
can damage taste nerves leading to taste bud degeneration and taste deficits. The CT and
associated taste buds regenerate after experimental nerve sectioning and restore taste function
in normal mice, but taste dysfunction often persists in humans. In contrast to taste
development, we have a poor understanding of injury-induced mechanisms responsible for
rebuilding taste buds in adults. Our overall goal is to identify neuroimmune mechanisms
mediating taste bud regeneration to provide strategies to restore taste function after injury and
disease. Cytokine receptor signaling has diverse inflammatory and pro-regenerative effects in
injured complex tissues. We previously demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-1 signaling through its
receptor is critical for taste bud regeneration and the recovery of neural taste responses. Our
preliminary results indicate that signaling through the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) is
also needed for taste bud regeneration, likely through different mechanisms than IL-1R. We
hypothesize that TNFR1 and IL1R signaling activate downstream nuclear factor (NF)-κB,
potentially in different cell types, to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of new taste
receptor cells. We propose a comprehensive neuroimmune approach in injured mice deficient in
system-wide Tnfr1 and taste cell-specific or immune cell-specific Il1r, Tnfr1, and Rela (a major
subunit of NFκB). Our aims are to: (1) Determine the requirement for TNFR1 signaling in taste
bud regeneration and the recovery of neural taste function after CT axotomy; (2) Dissect the
cellular requirements for TNFR1 and IL-1R signaling in the injured peripheral taste system; and
(3) Identify converging intracellular signaling mechanisms through (NF)-κB that promote taste
bud regeneration. Together these studies will illuminate complex, injury-mediated mechanisms
that promote adult taste bud regeneration and restore the sense of taste."

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in the United States and causes more than
12,500 deaths per year with rising incidence and mortality as well as declining 5-year survival rates. Type I
(endometrioid) tumors make up 85% of all endometrial cancer cases and the vast majority of these tumors
express estrogen receptor alpha (ER). Almost every major risk factor for endometrial cancer involves excess or
unopposed estrogen, indicating that estrogen signaling through ER is a critical driver of endometrial cancer
progression. Despite the clear importance of estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer, animal models indicate
that excess estrogens are not sufficient in isolation to cause endometrial cancer and 98% of human
endometrial tumors harbor at least one somatic mutation in a commonly mutated gene. ARID1A is one of those
commonly mutated genes, harboring mostly truncating mutations in the majority of endometrioid endometrial
tumors at a rate that is higher in endometrial cancer than any other cancer type. ARID1A is a member of the
canonical BAF nucleosome remodeling complex, a complex that interacts with ER based on the literature and
our data. The loss of ARID1A in endometrial cancer cells could have several effects on estrogen signaling and
gene regulation in general, including an increased importance of ARID1B or non-canonical BAF complex
variants. These changes may create distinct vulnerabilities in ARID1A altered estrogen-responsive endometrial
tumors. In this proposal, we will explore the molecular and phenotypic crosstalk between estrogen signaling
and ARID1A alterations while taking advantage of our unique resources, including purified complete BAF
complex and a collection of endometrial cancer and normal endometrial models.
 • In specific aim 1, we will probe the biochemical consequences of ARID1A loss on BAF activity and
 recruitment by ER.
 • In specific aim 2, we will analyze the genome-wide gene regulation consequences of combined
 ARID1A alterations and active estrogen signaling.
 • In specific aim 3, we will look for unique vulnerabilities in ARID1A mutant and ER active endometrial
 cancer cells using genetic and pharmaceutical approaches.
The successful completion of this project will greatly enhance our understanding of how ARID1A alterations
work together with estrogen signaling to promote endometrial cancer and has the potential to uncover novel
treatment strategies that are desperately needed for this disease."

Osteoclast formation depends on the cytokine receptor activator of NFB ligand (RANKL), whose actions are
inhibited by the decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Osteocytes are an important source of RANKL and we
have recently shown that osteoblasts, but not osteocytes, are an essential source of the OPG that suppresses
resorption of cancellous bone. In contrast, osteoblasts and osteocytes provide only a portion of the OPG
protecting cortical bone. Thus, the identity of the cells providing the OPG that protects large regions of cortical
bone remains unclear, but may involve osteoblast progenitors and vascular endothelial cells, both of which
express OPG. Previous studies suggest that a major function of beta-catenin is to promote OPG expression in
osteocytes. Our finding that osteoblasts, but not osteocytes, are a major source of OPG necessitates a
reevaluation of the role of beta-catenin in osteocytes. Previous beta-catenin loss-of-function studies have been
hampered by the lack of Cre driver strains that can distinguish between osteoblasts and osteocytes and by the
dramatic bone loss caused by beta-catenin deletion in late-stage osteoblastic cells. That osteoblasts are an
important source of OPG also suggests that the rapid increase in resorption and rebound bone loss following
discontinuation of anti-RANKL (denosumab) therapy may be due, in part, to the absence of osteoblasts, and
thus OPG, during the period following discontinuation. Based on these findings, we propose the hypotheses
that osteoblast progenitors or vascular endothelial cells are important sources of the OPG protecting cortical
bone and that the beta-catenin pathway in osteocytes contributes to bone remodeling independent of its control
of OPG expression. We also propose that the lack of osteoblasts, and thus OPG, contributes to the rebound
resorption following discontinuation of denosumab. Aim 1 will identify cellular sources of OPG that control cortical
bone resorption by deleting a conditional OPG allele in mesenchymal progenitors using Prx1-Cre mice, and
vascular endothelial cells using Tek-Cre mice, and compare the effects on cortical bone to those seen in OPG-
null mice. Aim 2 will determine the role of beta-catenin in osteocytes by deletion of beta-catenin using Sost-Cre
mice, which delete target genes in osteocytes but not osteoblasts. Aim 3 will determine whether the rebound
resorption caused by discontinuation of denosumab results in part from the profound lack of osteoblasts
producing OPG using a novel humanized RANKL mouse line treated with denosumab. These mice will be used
to map the cellular and molecular conditions associated with discontinuation of denosumab and to determine
whether promotion of osteoblast formation via anti-sclerostin antibody administration can restore OPG levels
and ameliorate rebound resorption."

Head and neck carcinomas (HNC) are some of the most challenging cancers to effectively treat (five-year
survival rates for some HNCs are as low as 25%); recurrence rates range from 8% to 43%. The number of
new cases is rising due to the current, near epidemic of HPV-associated HNCs. Unfortunately, most treatments
are associated with significant morbidity due to damage of sensitive structures in the region (spinal cord,
salivary glands, parotid gland, esophagus, carotid arteries and thyroid gland). HNCs are treated with surgical
excision, radiation therapy, or a combination of methods. Selection of therapy is based upon assessment of
tumor location, size, proximity to bone, amount of infiltration into surrounding tissues and spread to regional
lymph nodes performed with advanced imaging methods. Perhaps the most promising of these methods is
metabolic-based imaging, specifically PET, often utilizing FDG. The non-optimal spatial resolution and fixed
geometry of whole body scanners, however, limits PET in fulfilling its promise in this role by inhibiting the ability
to accurately detect small tumor masses in lymph nodes, and in quantifying the size and nature of the primary
tumor. Thus, there is an unmet need for improved PET/CT scanner technology to enhance treatment planning
of HNCs. To address this opportunity, we propose the creation and testing of a lower-cost, flexible geometry,
high-resolution PET/CT system (approaching the spatial resolution of pre-clinical PET scanners), called
HNPET/CT, designed specifically for the imaging of the head and neck region. It will consist of a novel pair of
large area, immersion-cooled, PET detectors and a cone beam CT (CBCT) scanner mounted on a rotating
gantry whose geometry can be tailored to patient size and anatomy to be scanned. To capitalize on
HNPET/CT’s high-resolution images, an image segmentation method that utilizes both CBCT and PET images
will be developed and tested. We plan to explore the potential utility of HNPET/CT for enhancing therapy
planning (surgical and radiation). This assessment will first be performed with anthropomorphic phantoms and
then in a limited human trial. In addition to the novel detector design and adjustable geometry, HNPET/CT will
introduce a new capability to the treatment planning of HNCs not yet broadly employed by end users in the
clinical. It could enhance current planning techniques (reduce treatment margin size, for example), enable the
effective application of advanced methods (dose painting, for example), and perhaps inspire development of
new, more effective personalized treatment strategies that require high resolution, multi-modality imaging. The
lower cost of the system promises the introduction of cutting-edge, image-guided treatments to under-served
populations in areas treated by small or private clinics that often cannot afford such technology. This project
will be performed by a multi-disciplinary academic industrial partnership joining the Departments of Radiology,
Head and Neck Surgery and Radiation Oncology at West Virginia University, and Xoran Technologies, LLC."
10831401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One in nine people aged 65 or older in the US lives with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease-related
dementia (ADRD). Patients living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners rely on primary care clinic visits
for dementia information, management, and community referrals. Quality interpersonal communication is
associated with improved health-related outcomes. Models of triadic interactions purport that information
exchange, rapport, and patient and care partner engagement in goal setting and decision-making are key to
effective interpersonal communication. However, the degree to which effective interpersonal communication is
achieved during triadic visits is unknown, and few interventions to support it exist. Using audio recordings of
clinic visits is a novel, evidence-based strategy with the potential to support triadic interactions, yet its application
is unexplored in dementia. The objective of this proposal is to design an intervention that enhances interpersonal
communication in triadic visits using visit recordings. Applicants will follow the NIH Stage Model to redesign their
visit recording platform, HealthPAL, which leverages natural language processing to structure visit information.
The specific aims are: Aim 1 (Stage 0): Conduct a prospective observational study, with outpatient clinic visits of
200 triads (PLWD/care partner/clinician) audio recorded for 12 months; 1.a. Examine the association between
interpersonal communication in triadic AD/ADRD visits and health-related outcomes; 1.b. Identify barriers and
enablers to interpersonal communication in triadic AD/ADRD visits; Aim 2 (Stage 1A): Adapt HealthPAL to
enhance interpersonal communication in triadic AD/ADRD visits; and Aim 3 (Stage 1B): Demonstrate the
usability, feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of HealthPAL in AD/ADRD. Applicants hypothesize:
1) Constructs from models of interpersonal communication will be associated with health-related outcomes; 2)
HealthPAL will surpass usability, feasibility and acceptability metrics for dyads and clinicians. In Aim 1 applicants
will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. Informed by the Behavior Change Wheel, targets for
behavior change will be identified using quantitative assessment of interpersonal communication during triadic
visits (200 dyads, 3 visits annually; ∼600 visits), supplemented by semi-structured interviews with a purposive
sample of 1a triads (n=42); In Aim 2, we will use participatory design methods (n=60) to redesign HealthPAL
using findings from Aim 1; and in Aim 3 we will use an open label, single-arm, multi-site pilot trial (n=30) to
determine usability, feasibility and acceptability of HealthPAL and gather preliminary data on its impact on
interpersonal communication in triadic AD/ADRD visits. This work is a necessary first step to improving PLWD
triadic care by identifying behaviors that impact interpersonal communication and their associations with health-
related outcomes. The intervention developed, and the extensive data collected, will serve as a powerful
resource that can be leveraged to address other gaps in clinical knowledge related to the care of PLWD."

The overarching goal of the Liu group is to facilitate the discovery and synthesis of complex
bioactive small molecules by developing novel copper-catalyzed reactions and to elucidate the
reactive intermediates in copper-catalyzed bond-forming reactions. The selective construction
of carbon–carbon (C–C) and carbon–heteroatom (C–X) bonds remains the most important
synthetic tool in organic chemistry, with these reactions playing a vital role in the synthesis of
natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. However, most such transformations
rely on the least abundant elements in Earth's crust. Owing to their many attractive
characteristics, copper catalysts represent an appealing alternative to precious-metal catalysts,
although copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions still have various limitations. Recently, we
and others recognized that copper catalysis provides a powerful strategy for the
functionalization of sp3-hybridized carbon radicals to construct C–C and C–heteroatom bonds.
To date, our group has developed a menu of copper-catalyzed coupling reactions for alkyl
electrophiles via the activation of C–COOH, C–N, C–H, and C–O bonds, with an initial focus on
the installation of fluoroalkyl groups into medicinally relevant moieties. These promising results
led us to envision the emergence of copper-catalyzed, radical-activated cross-coupling
reactions as a powerful tool for solving a range of long-standing synthetic problems. In this
proposal, we will demonstrate that merging the copper-catalyzed functionalization of C(sp3)
radicals with different radical generation pathways offers a viable approach for the cross-
coupling of unactivated alkyl electrophiles. Specifically, we aim to develop reactions such as the
deoxygenative cross-coupling of alcohols, the selective alkylation of C(sp3)–H bonds, and the
cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl halides. These transformations are either unknown or have
limited reaction scope. The development and mechanistic understanding of these
transformations will make a significant contribution toward advancing the field of transition-
metal catalysis."
10831514,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Mitochondria are the evolutionary product of the endosymbiosis between the ancestral
eukaryotic cell and an obligate aerobe bacterium, which brought new functionalities to eukaryotic cells. During
their evolution, mitochondria transferred more than 99% of their known genetic material to the nucleus – with the
exception of a small, multi-copy genome referred to as mtDNA. In Homo sapiens, the 16.6 Kbp of mtDNA is
circular and encodes for 13 members of the oxidative phosphorylation chain (OXPHOS) and other structural
RNAs. Beyond their canonical role in the generation of ATP through OXPHOS, the mitochondria are also critical
stakeholders in several cellular processes from metabolite fluxes and calcium signaling to cell death and aging.
Recently, mitochondrial stress has been implicated in the aberrant activation of innate immunity, mediated by
the release of organellar components, such as mitochondrial nucleic acids, recognized by cytosolic sensors as
foreign and potentially dangerous. Aberrant immunity has deep implications in human health and is a driver of
human diseases, such as neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. Mitochondrial immunity has been studied both
in vitro and in vivo, but the complete repertoire of its triggers and effectors has yet to be characterized. I recently
uncovered a previously unknown source of stress conducive to aberrant immunity: stress to the mtDNA in the
form of double-stranded breaks (mtDSBs). The presence of this stressor is relayed to the cytosolic compartment
via mitochondrial herniation, a recently described form of Bax/Bak mediated organelle permeabilization, that
exposes mitochondrial contents to the cytosol. After mtDSBs, mitochondrial RNA – rather than the recipient of
the stress, mtDNA – initiated the innate immunity cascade by activating the sensor RIG-I. Our proposed research
plan builds on this past work to ask essential questions: (1) which sources of mtDNA stress are conducive to
aberrant immunity and what is the impact of dysfunctional mitochondrial transcription or translation; (2) how is
mitochondrial herniation regulated and how does it differ from other forms of mitochondrial permeabilization; and
(3) what are the distinctive features of mitochondrial RNA activation of RIG-I and where do they originate?
 Our goal is to understand how mitochondria integrate and translate stress signals, particularly in the
context of innate immunity. My lab will probe different sources of mtDNA stress and interrogate the mechanisms,
effectors, and mitochondrial moieties engaging the cytosolic sensors of immunity. RIG-I is a key protein for the
defense against viruses, but its aberrant activation is involved in both autoimmune conditions and the beneficial
anti-tumor responses elicited by cancer treatments. By building upon our recent findings and prior experience,
as well as by establishing collaborations and seeking the assistance of senior investigators with advanced
expertise in both mitochondrial biology and the key technologies proposed, our research program aims to have
long-lasting impacts on the foundational and translational knowledge of cellular stress responses going beyond
mitochondrial biology into a pathway with further implications in human health and disease: innate immunity."

Pyroptosis is a most “explosive” and immunogenic form of lytic cell death involving spillage of
cellular contents, and has been defined as cell death mediated by the gasdermin (GSDM) family
of proteins. This breakthrough understanding was brought about in 2015 when gasdermin D
(GSDMD) was identified as a downstream effector of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular
complexes that activate inflammatory caspases (-1, -4 and -5 in human and -1 and -11 in mouse).
GSDMD gets cleaved by caspases to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) and a C-
terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT), and GSDMD-NT was shown to mediate pyroptosis, as well as
the release of IL-1 family cytokines, which are processed by caspase-1 to the mature form. The
GSDM family comprises six members in humans (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD,
GSDME/DFNA5, and DFNB59). In 2021, Ninjurin1 (NINJ1), a member of the NINJ family
comprised of 2 transmembrane proteins in mammals, was shown to act downstream of GSDMD
pore formation to induce the plasma membrane rupture required for full release of damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMP) such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
We and others found that upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, GSDMD-NT specifically
binds to acidic lipids, and exhibits strong membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells by
forming pores on membranes during pyroptosis and in vitro. Other GSDMs, upon cleavage by
appropriate proteases, also form transmembrane pores.
Here we propose to elucidate the structural mechanism of pore formation by the GSDM family,
and of membrane disruption by NINJ1. Understanding how GSDMs are regulated and exert their
pore forming activity, and how NINJ1 oligomerizes to induce plasma membrane rupture will not
only provide new insights on pyroptosis, but also afford new therapeutic strategies for treating
inflammasome-related and pyroptosis-related diseases."

Neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging are clinically and pathologically defined syndromes with
heterogeneous genetic endophenotypes, some of which are unique to one disease while others are shared
across diseases. Despite the economic and healthcare burden, treatments targeted to endophenotypes are not
available for neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Progressive Supranuclear
Palsy (PSP). AD and PSP are pathologically related by abnormal tau protein inclusions and the tau gene is a
shared genetic risk factor. Unique genetic risk in common variants have been identified for AD (ABCA7, BIN1)
and PSP (STX6, EIF2AK3). However, a significant part of genetic heritability remains unexplained; a proportion
of which is likely due to rare variants. Identification of rare genetic risk factors may delineate the endophenotypes
of AD and PSP, unlocking future therapeutic targets. The objectives of this proposal are to identify and validate
rare genetic risk factors that are unique to or shared by AD and PSP. The long-term goal is to realize precision
medicine for neurodegenerative dementias by leveraging genomics and biomedical informatics. Traditional rare
variant analyses have limited power due to the large number of variants and small variant effect size. Although
one solution is to group variants into genes, genes do not act in isolation, but rather interact with one another in
networks. Grouping variants in a network can improve power. Additionally, since most genetic risk lies in large
noncoding regions of the genome, focusing analyses on noncoding regulatory regions should further increase
power. We hypothesize that incorporating network connectivity in rare variant statistical tests and prioritizing
functional noncoding variants followed by validation will identify rare genetic risk factors in AD and PSP by
overcoming deficiencies in traditional methods. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims. Aim 1 is
to develop and apply rare variant statistical tests that incorporate network connectivity to identify dementia risk
genes. Aim 2 is to identify noncoding rare genetic risk variants by developing a noncoding prioritization and gene
assignment strategy. Aim 3 is to validate rare variants that are unique to or shared by AD and PSP. The advances
from these studies will expand our understanding of dementia risk and provide new targets for therapeutic
development in neurodegenerative disease. The K08 training will build on my previous strengths in clinical
informatics to gain expertise in genetics, genome informatics and functional genomics. My mentorship team will
consist of faculty with expertise in these domains and clinical care. We will have regular meetings and monitor
progress. The environment at UCLA includes interdepartmental collaborations, powerful computing resources,
and genetic laboratory resources to complete the aims. The career development plan forges a pathway to
become a clinician-scientist."

The goals of this NCI Pathway to Independence Career Development proposal are to request support for
training to develop expertise in developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer while investigating the
role of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) in promoting sensitivity to HSP70 inhibition.
K99/R00 support during this part of my career will be integral to my successful development as an independent
cancer researcher. The training plan outlined in this proposal will take advantage of the extensive resources at
The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania as well as Temple University. My training will also be guided by
the advisory committee who have successfully mentored multiple predoctoral, postdoctoral, and clinical fellows
in academic careers.
 The scientific portion of this proposal focuses on experimentally determining the molecular mechanism
underlying the sensitivity of CARM1-expresing ovarian cancer cells to HSP70 inhibition. The proposed studies
are based on my previous findings that CARM1 is often overexpressed and functions as an oncogene in ovarian
cancer patients. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has the highest rate of CARM1 amplification and
overexpression (~20% combined) among all cancer types. Moreover, high CARM1 levels are associated with
poor survival in EOC patients. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel approaches to target CARM1-expressing
EOC. My preliminary data suggest CARM1-expressing cells are selectively sensitive to HSP70 inhibition. HSP70
is a crucial part of the protein folding machinery and its levels are upregulated in multiple types of cancer.
Interestingly, HSP70 is a substrate for CARM1’s enzymatic activity. However, the effect of HSP70 modification
by CARM1 is not fully understood. Thus, the major goal of this proposal is to determine whether CARM1-
expressing EOC can be treated and ultimately eradicated by novel therapeutic strategies based on HSP70
inhibition. Therefore, I will explore the following scientific aims: 1) To elucidate the mechanistic basis underlying
the selectivity against CARM1-high cells by HSP70 inhibition by using gain and loss of function assays in
CARM1-high and CARM1-low expressing EOC cells. 2) To develop novel therapeutic strategies for CARM1-
expressing EOCs based on HSP70 inhibition. The completion of the scientific aims in this proposal will help
develop my research skills and knowledge in the field of ovarian cancer and will lay a critical foundation to
establish the use HSP70 inhibitors in CARM1-high EOCs as a single agent or in combination with other promising
small-molecule inhibitors such as EZH2 inhibitors."

Compromised olfactory function is associated with the aging process, as well as a number of human diseases.
Our incomplete understanding of the brain makes it challenging to comprehend the mechanisms that underlie
these sensory deficits and other psychiatric disorders. Understanding how sensory information is encoded and
transformed by neural circuits will help define the basic mechanisms that underlie these challenges. For many
animals, smell is critical for recognizing and locating food, mates and dangers. Odor recognition requires the
identification of a specific smell that can vary in intensity, while localization involves detecting a concentration
profile that varies in time and space. Both processes must be carried out while the stimulus is embedded in a
complex chemical context. This requires that the olfactory system recognize and maintain a concentration-
invariant representation of the odor, while detecting its changing concentration gradient and segmenting its
percept from other chemical stimuli present in the environment. Understanding how the brain carries out these
processes is key to understanding perceptual stability. The goal of this proposal is to define the neural circuits
that support odor recognition and the ability to adjust sensitivity to complex olfactory scenes in vivo. First, we
will define how changes in odor concentration are encoded and transformed across the olfactory bulb circuit.
Next, we will examine how different concentrations or durations of odor exposure impact olfactory bulb
responses to future odor stimulation. We will then test the hypothesis that olfactory bulb adaptation underlies
dynamic range adjustments involved in maintaining sensitivity in different odor backgrounds. This proposal will
answer these questions using an imaging approach to measure the neural activity from the olfactory receptor
neuron input, and the mitral/tufted cell output that innervate olfactory bulb glomeruli. We will pair this strategy
with a mechanistic toolkit to dissect the underlying mechanisms that drive functional transformations in the
bulb. The impact of this proposal will be to generate a comprehensive mechanistic description of how two
perceptual functions are carried out by the olfactory bulb, which are the critical first steps that will ultimately link
physiology with naturalistic behavior."
10843244,"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), encoded by the Pdcd1 gene, is an immune inhibitory receptor that is expressed
transiently on the surface of T cells following immune activation but is highly expressed on T cells chronically
exposed to antigen. Sustained signaling through PD-1 results in T cell exhaustion, a state in which PD-1
expression is maintained at a high level and where the T cells can no longer respond normally to antigenic
challenge. Antibody mediated “checkpoint” blockade of the PD-1–PDL1/2 pathways in numerous cancers, which
results in reinvigoration of T cell immune responses, has had astonishing success in the clinic. PD-1 has been
extensively studied in mouse model systems; yet despite its clear therapeutic importance, nearly nothing is
known about how PD-1 is regulated in humans! No systematic examination of the cis or trans-regulatory
elements of the human PD-1 gene has been conducted and the role of epigenetic pathways regulating its
expression is limited. Additionally, PD-1 is highly expressed on TFH cells, yet only limited information regarding
its regulation in this cell type is known. Here we seek to fill this knowledge gap by determining how PD-1 is
regulated in human CD4, CD8, and TFH T cells. Elucidating the molecular and epigenetic programs that control
hPdcd1 expression will provide new understanding, tools, and targets to manipulate PD-1 gene expression that
could potentially be used to treat infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. It is clear from the reported data that PD-
1 gene regulation is complex and dependent on the cell type and immune environment/challenge. Therefore,
we have focused this application on elucidating the basic transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms
that control hPdcd1 expression in human T cells. Aim 1 will identify and determine the function of the hPdcd1’s
cis-regulatory elements as these are the key to all else that follows. For these experiments, we will use
deidentified, peripheral primary human naïve, ex vivo activated, and memory CD8 and CD4 T cells, TFH cells, as
well as Jurkat cells as a model T cell line. Antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells will be isolated from deidentified,
HIV-infected individuals to represent chronically exposed/exhausted T cells. We will integrate epigenomic data
(ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and bisulfite sequencing) of the above cells to probe the mechanisms by which the cis
elements are functioning. Aim 2 will define the transcription factors (TFs) responsible for hPdcd1 regulation.
Here we will use genomic information to identify motifs for putative factors and use CRISPR/Cas9 and lentiviral
expression systems in primary human T cells to knockout or exogenously express factors and determine their
role in regulating hPdcd1. We will use ChIP to define factor binding/occupancy. Lastly, we will use chromatin
conformation capture methodologies to demonstrate direct interactions between TFs and their binding sites with
the hPdcd1 promoter region and identified enhancers. Together this program will identify the fundamental
mechanisms by which hPdcd1 is regulated and will ultimately provide evidence supporting therapies aimed at
controlling this pathway through the manipulation of gene regulation."

This application requests support for the PhD Program in Systems Biology at Harvard University. This
profoundly interdisciplinary program attracts top students with backgrounds ranging from pure mathematics to
medicine, and offers them the resources and support to develop an independent and quantitative approach to
important biological questions. The Systems Biology program integrates systems biology research across the
whole of Harvard University, including Harvard's main (Cambridge) campus and the basic science departments
of Harvard Medical School (HMS) and its teaching hospitals, creating a genuinely unified cross-Harvard
program that encourages student creativity and choice of both research area and of future career.
The behavior of biological systems is complex and often unpredictable, in ways that profoundly challenge our
ability to diagnose and treat diseases or understand the behavior of the world around us. We believe that
students who have a deep understanding of both quantitative measurement technologies and mathematical or
computational approaches will develop creative new ways to grapple with the complexity of biological systems.
The program is also a major vehicle for bringing quantitative and theoretical approaches into problems relevant
to the clinic.
Since the last submission of this grant, the program has made major strides towards a representative student
population: this year, for the first time, female scientists are in the majority in the entering cohort of 8 women
and 3 men and applications from underrepresented minorities doubled in 2017-18 compared to previous years.
The average time to degree is 5.4 years. The previous grant supported 6 trainees. In this funding period we
request support for 8 trainees.
The Harvard Systems Biology PhD Program is a pioneering program and an ongoing experiment. The program
aims to help students identify biological questions to which an interdisciplinary approach can provide uniquely
satisfying answers, and to prepare them to identify and address such questions in their future careers. The
program pays particular attention to rigor and reproducibility, training students in the physicochemical basis of
the measurements they make and in appropriate techniques, and common pitfalls, in statistical analysis.
Training for communication across disciplines and to the lay public is foundational for the Program and is
emphasized throughout each student's career."
10844398,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatric disorders are highly polygenic, exhibit a complex pattern of genetic correlations across the full
spectrum of diagnostic categories. Genetic risk for psychiatric disorders acts via a poorly understood set of
intermediate mechanisms. With substantial investments in large consortia, registry-based efforts, and national
biobanks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders and related quantitative
phenotypes have made substantial strides in attaining the power needed to detect reproducible genetic
associations, estimate genome-wide chip heritabilities, and estimate genetic correlations between traits.
Combined with bioinformatic approaches, GWAS efforts have produced insights into tissues and cell types
relevant to psychiatric disease, and atlases of genetic correlations have rapidly expanded the ontological
network of descriptive knowledge of shared genetic architecture across psychiatric diseases and social,
behavioral, and biological traits. In order to more fully capitalize on this growing corpus of GWAS research
output, we have recently introduced Genomic Structural Equating Modeling (Genomic SEM; Grotzinger et al.,
2019; Nature Human Behaviour), an analytic framework and associated software for multivariate modelling of
genetic architecture using GWAS summary data from samples of varying or unknown degrees of overlap. The
primary goal of this R01 proposal is to capitalize on and further develop Genomic SEM to formally
investigate genetic risk sharing across psychiatric disorders and- equally importantly- genetic
differentiation between them. We will (1) identify transdiagnostic dimensions of genetic sharing across
psychiatric disorders, and test for commonalities and divergence in genetic associations with biological and
psychosocial dimensions of potentially cross-cutting genetic risk; (2) Identify gene sets and categories that
contribute disproportionately to risk sharing across disorders and/or to disorder-specific genetic variation; (3)
Formally distinguish disorder-general from disorder-specific Loci; and (4) Considerably expand the suite of
methods currently available in Genomic SEM software to meet increasing demand by the genetics community.
The availability of sex-stratified GWAS summary data will allow us to examine convergent and divergent
patterns of association and multivariate genetic architecture across males and females. Moreover, we will
incorporate cutting edge methods for modeling trans-ethnic data, which will be of increasing value as more
diverse GWAS samples become available. This project will constitute the most comprehensive interrogation of
the shared and disorder-specific genetic architecture of major psychiatric disorders and their relationships to
biological and psychosocial dimensions of potentially cross-cutting genetic risk, and will provide an expanded
suite of novel, user friendly, free, open-source tools that serve the entire genetics community."
10844399,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Endometriosis is an inflammatory gynecological disease of reproductive-age women. The two major symptoms
are chronic pelvic pain and infertility, which profoundly affect reproductive health and life quality. The pro-
inflammatory microenvironment of the endometriotic lesions, endometrium, and the peritoneal cavity are the
hallmarks of endometriosis, which leads to chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Emerging evidence suggests that
pelvic pain in endometriosis is a combination of visceral inflammatory and neuropathic pain. The long-term
goals are to understand the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of endometriosis and identify non-steroidal
therapy for endometriosis. Withania somnifera, an ancient medicinal plant, has been used to treat inflammatory
disorders, neurological diseases/disorders, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, and cancers. A wide range of
therapeutic effects of Withania somnifera is exerted through its active steroidal lactone Withaferin-A. However,
no studies have investigated the role of Withania somnifera/Withaferin-A in endometriosis. The proposed timely
needed hypothesis-driven novel preclinical research is focused on the therapeutic effects of Withaferin-A in
endometriosis. Overarching Hypothesis: Treatment of Withaferin-A suppresses the growth and survival of
endometriotic lesions, ameliorates pelvic pain, and restores the endometrial microenvironment to support fertility.
Objectives: Determine the therapeutic effects of Withaferin-A on (i) growth and survival of the endometriotic
lesions, (ii) pro-inflammatory state of the peritoneal cavity, endometriotic lesions, and pain-brain areas, (iii) pro-
inflammatory and hormonal microenvironment of the endometrium, (iv) epithelial and stromal cell-specific gene
signatures in the endometriotic lesions and endometrium, (v) ascending and descending pain pathway and
central sensitization and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, and (vi) pelvic pain threshold and
spontaneous pain. Specific Aim-1 will determine the therapeutic effects of Withaferin-A on endometriotic lesions
and endometrium. Specific Aim-2 will determine the therapeutic effects of Withaferin-A on central pain
mechanisms in endometriosis. The experimental approaches include the preclinical allograft mouse model of
endometriosis, RNA-Seq, electrophysiology of brain neurons, ascending and descending pain pathways, pain
behavior, in vivo bioimaging, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Innovation and Impact: The new
information obtained should fill the gap in the knowledge on therapeutic effects of Withaferin-A in (i) central
mechanisms of pelvic pain, gene expression signatures in the pain-brain areas, and their association with chronic
pelvic pain in endometriosis; (ii) epithelial and stromal cell-specific gene expression signatures in the
endometriotic lesions and their association with growth and survival of endometriotic lesions; and (iii) epithelial
and stromal cell-specific gene expression signatures in the endometrium and their association with infertility. (iv)
The novel results will establish a molecular therapeutic and preclinical basis to use Withaferin-A as a non-
steroidal and non-opioid therapy to treat pelvic pain and infertility in women with endometriosis."
10844492,"The goal of this research is to determine the mechanism and regulation of the initiation of DNA
replication in eukaryotic cells. It is clear that for maintenance of the integrity of the genome from
one cell generation to the next, DNA and its associated chromatin structures must be duplicated
in a highly controlled and accurate manner. Interruption of these controls may promote genome
instability and lead to neoplastic transformation in somatic cells or result in mutations in the germ
line that can cause many different disorders. Moreover, the DNA replication proteins represent
tangible targets for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis of proliferation of cancer cells and other
proliferative disorders. The initiator protein (ORC) cooperates with a series of DNA replication
proteins, including Cdc6, Cdt1 and the MCM2-7 hexamer to establish at origins of DNA replication
a pre-Replicative Complex (pre-RC) that facilitates later initiation of DNA synthesis at each origin.
Recent progress has determined the mechanism of assembly of the pre-RC and the structure
of its components. The proposed research in this application will investigate, using proteins from
multiple yeast species and human cells, how origins of DNA replication are specified in these
diverse genomes. One of them, the yeast S. cerevisiae has DNA sequence specific origins but
the others do not; therefore we propose to determine how these other eukaryotes specify and
control DNA replication origins."

X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (also known as SBMA or Kennedy's disease) is a rare
neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult-onset proximal muscle weakness due to lower motor neuron
degeneration. SBMA patients display signs of androgen insensitivity, including gynecomastia, reduced fertility,
and testicular atrophy. SBMA, is caused by a CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the androgen
receptor (AR) gene and is one member of a family of nine CAG-polyQ repeat disorders that includes
Huntington’s disease. For decades, research into the basis of neurological disease focused upon the
contribution of neuronal dysfunction to disease pathogenesis. However, over the last ten years, there has been
growing evidence in the motor neuron disease field that challenges the prevailing neurocentric theory of the
etiology of many neurological diseases. Recently, we have identified increased cell death in control motor
neurons subjected to conditioned media from SBMA iPSC-derived skeletal muscles compared to control
derived skeletal muscles. This finding emphasizes the importance of muscle toxicity in SBMA disease
pathogenesis. For therapeutic purposes, however, there is lack of consensus in the literature. Different groups
have been able to demonstrate successful treatments targeting either the skeletal muscle or the central
nervous system using different SBMA animal models. Consequently, there is a need for studies of the SBMA
AR-mutation on the affected cell types, skeletal muscle and motor neurons, in a human background.
Therefore, the applicant, Dr. Helen C. Miranda, is proposing to combine her considerable experience in
stem cell biology and motor neuron disease modeling to a mentorship in functional genomics, to test the
hypothesis that the AR transcriptional network is tissue-specific in SBMA. This project will test this hypothesis
by combining AR genome wide occupancy and gene expression data sets generated from SBMA and isogenic
controls iPSC-derived skeletal muscle and motor neurons. This work will advance understanding on the
molecular mechanisms of human mutant AR to SBMA pathogenesis and evaluate the utility of iPSC-derived
skeletal muscles and motor neurons tool to develop SBMA in vitro studies. Dr. Miranda is a new Assistant
Professor in the Department of Genetics and the Department of Neuroscience at Case Western Reserve
University. She will devote 75% of her time to research under this award and will supplement her research with
didactic training in genomic and transcriptomic analyses. This training will be comprised of 1) departmental and
university courses, 2) seminars and journal clubs 3) responsible conduct of research courses and 4) national
and international conferences. Dr. Miranda will be mentored by Dr. Anthony Wynshaw-Boris and Dr. Ann
Harris at Case Western Reserve University. These established scientists are both renowned experts in stem
cell biology and functional genomics. Dr. Miranda has met with each of her mentors to discuss this project and
will continue to meet with them at regular intervals (specified in mentorship letters) during the course of this
award. She is expected to produce manuscripts as corresponding or co-corresponding author and be
competitive for R-level grants during the course of this award. This project will integrate Dr. Miranda’s current
expertise with additional training to develop a well-rounded, independent research program."

Heart failure (HF) is major cause of morbidity and mortality and its incidence is expected to increase over the
next decade. Characteristics of HF include an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, with increased
sympathetic tone and parasympathetic withdrawal, as well as chronic inflammation. Factors that contribute to
increased sympathetic tone include increased release of the primary neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and
co-transmitter, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Although b-blocker therapy is a well-established approach for modulating
the effects of NE during heart failure, even high levels of these agents do not fully prevent the effects of
sympathetic activation. Recent work has demonstrated that increased plasma levels of NPY are correlated with
worse outcomes in HF, including increased sudden cardiac deaths, suggesting that the co-release of NPY
contributes to disease pathology and may be arrhythmogenic. Indeed, addition of an NPY blocker together with
b-blocker therapy has shown promise in preventing the effects of increased sympathetic activation. Despite
evidence that overactivity of sympathetic neurons contributes to HF, the mechanisms underlying the enhanced
release of NPY have yet to be investigated. Importantly, direct observations of NPY transport in sympathetic
neurons and knowledge of the molecular pathways involved are lacking. We hypothesize that inflammatory
signals that are elevated during cardiovascular disease potentiate NPY trafficking and release, contributing to
disease progression. Although treatments can help stabilize or slow disease progression for patients with heart
failure, prognosis remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. Thus, understanding the
molecular changes that underly the dynamic regulation of sympathetic neurons will enable the development of
novel therapeutic interventions. We recently developed a novel imaging technique, optical pulse-chase axonal
long-distance (OPAL) imaging, that enables the visualization of axonal trafficking of proteins with single-molecule
resolution. Using this and other imaging techniques, we propose to investigate the trafficking of NPY-containing
vesicles in cardiac sympathetic neurons from neonatal mice cultured in compartmentalized microfluidic
chambers. We will investigate the molecular motors and trafficking machinery involved in the long-distance
axonal transport of NPY, including Rab-GTPases and kinesin motors. Elucidation of this pathway will provide
targets of opportunity for therapeutic interventions for conditions such as HF. Additionally, we propose to
investigate the dynamic regulation of NPY trafficking and release in response to inflammatory cytokines found
in HF. Together, these will provide the first report of dynamic regulation of vesicular trafficking and neuropeptide
release in sympathetic neurons, and could transform how we detect and treat some cardiovascular diseases."

This proposal aims to develop and optimize antigen-specific T cell activation and expansion platforms for
antigen-specific immunotherapy. Our goal is to enable the generation of new cancer immunotherapies and
reduce time, complexity, and cost while improving product performance and consistency. Our focus is on
harnessing both CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to enhance cancer immunotherapy, although the
technologies developed are expected to have broader applications in vaccine development and autoimmunity
as well. In SA1 we will engineer nanoparticle-based artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) to activate and
expand CD4+ T cells. We aim to manipulate two key CD4+ T cell phenotypes: cytotoxic CD4+ T cells and CD4+
T cells that help effector CD8+ T cells. Various features of the aAPCs will be optimized, such as mechanical
stiffness, cytokines, T cell receptor affinity, and signal 2 effects. This optimization process will include analyzing
cytotoxic granule production, RNA-seq transcriptional profiles, and antitumor activity in murine tumor models.
Additionally, a prototype class I/II aAPC that activates both CD4+ and CD8+ cells will be developed. In SA2 we
will engineer biodegradable hydrogel microparticle (MP)-based aAPCs for T cell stimulation that has both ex vivo
and in vivo applications. We aim to create aAPCs that incorporate T cell-stimulating signals, biomechanical cues,
and key biological features of the lymph node. The phenotype and function of the engineered T cells will be
examined through adoptive transfer. Furthermore, the ability of the MP aAPCs to activate T cells in vivo and their
functional efficacy in murine tumor models will be analyzed. SA3 involves applying the developed aAPC
platforms to human T cells. Human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA II)-based nanoparticle and microparticle
aAPCs will be used to induce cytotoxic CD4+ T cells ex vivo, and their functional activity against tumor cell lines
will be evaluated in xenogeneic humanized mouse models. Combined HLA I/II aAPCs will be used to co-activate
human CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and their lytic activity, antitumor function. Overall, this proposal aims to advance
the field of antigen-specific immunotherapy by developing innovative T cell activation platforms that have the
potential to improve therapeutic outcomes in cancer and other diseases. The deliverables of this project include
nanoparticle aAPCs targeting CD4+ cytotoxic T cells, combinatorial MHC I/II aAPCs for simultaneous activation
of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, hydrogel microparticle-based aAPCs capable of activating and expanding CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells, and human HLA II-based nanoparticle and microparticle aAPCs, as well as combined HLA I/II

10862963,"TR&D2 Abstract
The goal of TR&D #2 is to bioengineer nanoimmunomaterial tools (NIMs) through the design and synthesis of
new biomaterials and nanoparticles (NPs) created for immunomodulation. This TR&D is driven by the needs of
CPs and SPs for safe, effective, and targeted tools to genetically manipulate immune cells ex vivo and in vivo.
Specifically, we will engineer NIMs’ chemical structure, physical properties, and surface coating with biologics
to maximize cell-specific intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to program immune cells. TR&D #2 focuses on
genetically engineering three specific types of immune cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells),
including applications to stimulate or suppress reactivity to antigens in vivo in a targeted, cell-specific fashion.
NIMs will be evaluated for applications to human health, including oncology and autoimmunity. NIMs will be
made available to be utilized as an enabling technology by the other TR&Ds as the NIMs are synthesized,
characterized, and validated. Additionally, the NIMs will be made available to CP collaborators, SP projects,
and the broader bioengineering and immunology communities as tools for investigators to further their own
research goals. TR&D2 supports and aligns with the Johns Hopkins Translational ImmunoEngineering (JH-TIE)

Biomedical Engineering) to design enabling immunoengineering technology and advance immunotherapy."
10862964,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching objective of TR&D 3 is to design and develop a novel category of immunomodulatory proteins,
both as tools to study the immune response and as targeted disease therapeutics. Cytokines control all aspects
of immune homeostasis and are thus of great interest as potential interventions to either stimulate immune
activity for treatment of cancer and infectious diseases or to suppress activity response for treatment of
autoimmune disorders and to promote transplant tolerance. Unfortunately, natural cytokines have several
intrinsic properties that limit their therapeutic application, including: (1) Pleiotropy, which hinders specificity,
safety, and efficacy; (2) Instability, which leads to challenges in formulation and manufacturability; and (3) Short
in vivo half-life, which limits durability of disease control.
To overcome inherent limitations of natural cytokines, emerging molecular engineering technologies aim to
modify native cytokines in order to improve their suitability as drugs. Our team has established a unique approach
to empower cytokines as therapeutics: fusion of natural cytokines to anti-cytokine antibodies, creating
intramolecularly assembled immunocytokines (ICs) that selectively direct the activities of cytokines to particular
immune cell subsets while also extending circulation half-life. Using this approach, we generated a
complementary pair of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based ICs that mount either immune effector cell-biased
(immunostimulatory) or regulatory T cell (Treg)-biased (immunosuppressive) responses. Our promising
preliminary work in developing ICs illustrates the potential for designing off-the-shelf molecular therapeutics that
selectively manipulate immune activity. Here, we aim to advance clinical translation of our technology by
evaluating IL-2 ICs in animal models of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes. In parallel, we
will extend our versatile cytokine/antibody fusion protein concept to the IL-7 system to promote T cell survival.
We will also harness our team’s recent discovery of a particularly suppressive subset of tumor-infiltrating Tregs to
specifically target an antagonistic IC to the tumor microenvironment that will promote anti-cancer immunity. Our
interdisciplinary team of protein engineers and immunologists is uniquely equipped to carry out the proposal
aims, which promise to help realize the potential of cytokine therapeutics. The IC deliverables resulting from this
project will be integrated with other platforms in the Center, installing these targeted proteins on artificial antigen-
presenting cells from TR&D 1 to promote antigen-specific immune activation, and coating ICs on
nanoimmunomaterials in TR&D 2 to selectively direct gene delivery. Moreover, ICs will be iteratively developed
through Collaborative Projects 1, 8, 9, and 10 and deployed in Service Projects 8, 10, and 12. Collectively, the
proposed work will demonstrate the translatability, modularity, and antagonistic potential of ICs, presenting a
novel molecular engineered technology for biasing immune activity to achieve therapeutically relevant outcomes."

10859958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in pediatric subspecialty care have improved the health of children who previously died, but now are
reaching adulthood, creating a fast-growing population of survivors. One example is congenital heart disease
(CHD), the most common birth defect, where now more adults with CHD are living than children. Disparities in
subspecialty health outcomes are magnified throughout the lifespan, in part due to failures in transitioning from
pediatric to adult providers, and in part due to a dearth of adult providers who understand pediatric chronic
conditions. Less than 10% of adults with CHD receive appropriate CHD care, with few adult cardiologists
trained to manage long-term CHD issues. Furthermore, scarcity of adult CHD (ACHD) providers makes it
especially challenging to access ACHD physicians, particularly for racial and ethnic minorities and those from
lower socioeconomic status (SES) and rural environments. Thus, a critical need exists to increase pediatric
health equity researchers to recognize and address subspecialty health disparities throughout the lifespan. In
this innovative grant, we propose utilizing existing expertise and infrastructure to train a new generation of
pediatric health equity researchers caring for high-risk chronic disease populations through a REsearch And
Career Health Equity System (REACHES). This system merges experts from Baylor College of Medicine
Population Sciences-Shared Research CORE and Texas Children's Hospital Health Policy Center to support
trainees and pediatricians whose research, advocacy or QI projects focus on health equity. REACHES directly
addresses two NIH NIMHD objectives: 1) to foster innovative collaborations and partnerships, and 2) support
the training of a diverse research workforce. Our proposed research exemplifies our REACHES expertise by
leveraging existing collaborative relationships and infrastructure with the TX Birth Defects Registry (TBDR), TX
A&M Department of Public Service and Administration (PSAA), Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping
experts, and the Adult Congenital Heart Association (ACHA) to address health disparities in transitioning ACHD
(18-24 yo) patients with moderate to severe CHD in Texas. We plan to 1) identify young ACHD with high-risk
sociodemographics (low SES, rural, and minoritized patients) for gaps in care 2) investigate key barriers to
ACHD care for patients 3) use barrier data to inform an ACHA patient navigation intervention to increase
access to ACHD care, and 4) transform the delivery of ACHD care through operationalizing an adapted hub-
and-spoke medical home model for CHD care (MMCC), comprised of an adult cardiologist at the hub with
pediatric and ACHD subspecialty consultation, and determine acceptability of the MMCC strategy to deliver
remote ACHD care using telemedicine and Project ECHO (a platform facilitating access to specialty expert
management and learning). This research directly addresses two NIH NIMHD objectives: 1) plan and
coordinate research in health disparities, and 2) address the multi-faceted nature of health disparities. Our
long-term goal is to increase pediatric health equity researchers and deliver equitable pediatric lifespan care."
10859944,"Abstract
Prenatal exposure to viruses and toxins places a developing fetus at risk for neurodevelopmental, motor, and
sensory deficits that may directly or indirectly impact language ability. To date, most research on prenatal
exposure effects have focused on clearly identifiable sequelae (e.g., microcephaly, hearing loss) that can be
detected shortly after birth. This approach omits the much larger group of children with a history of prenatal
exposure who appeared asymptomatic at birth or during infancy. We have demonstrated that children exposed
to the Zika virus (ZIKV) who were asymptomatic at birth exhibit a slower rate of communicative than cognitive
development during infancy that cannot be explained by nonverbal cognitive delays or peripheral hearing loss.
Our more recent data from exposed and not exposed children during the preschool age indicate group
differences in language and communicative skills. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that prenatal
viral exposure can result in altered language development in the absence of peripheral hearing loss or
nonverbal cognitive disabilities, that these characteristics become more apparent later in childhood, and can be
predicted by well-selected, sensitive behavioral and physiological measures. Children born during the ZIKV
pandemic in Brazil in 2015-2017 present a unique cohort with objectively documented exposure status. We
have begun study of this well-characterized cohort to evaluate language characteristics and identify auditory
neural markers. This application proposes to characterize the impact of prenatal virus exposure on the
development of language by addressing these specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To comprehensively characterize
language development in school-age children with prenatal exposure to ZIKV. Studies typically have followed
exposed children only through toddlerhood and utilized limited language measures. Emerging data suggest
that language difficulties increase as these children get older despite normal peripheral hearing and typical
cognitive skills. Specific Aim 2: To characterize auditory neural function in children with prenatal ZIKV
exposure. Studies of auditory function to date have focused on peripheral hearing sensitivity, which is rarely
abnormal, and have not systematically examined auditory neural processing, particularly for speech stimuli.
Specific Aim 3: To construct a model that describes concurrent and predictive relationships between language
ability, biological, cognitive, and environmental factors in children with prenatal ZIKV exposure. The proposed
research facilitates collaboration among researchers in the USA and in Brazil who follow some of the largest
cohorts of ZIKV-exposed children in the world. The opportunity to study this well-defined cohort of children will
improve understanding of the impact of prenatal virus exposure on language development and auditory neural
function, inform future studies investigating the effects of prenatal and postnatal factors on language outcomes,
and provide auditory markers for earlier identification of those at risk for language difficulties."

This project is instrumental in evaluating predictors of access and outcomes of post-acute care (PAC) and how
Social Determinants of Health (SDH) across rural and urban Rehabilitation Service Areas (RSA) influence
access and outcomes pre- and post-COVID pandemic. SDH are critically understudied drivers of access and
outcomes of PAC. The proposed project leverages the AHRQ SDH dataset coupled with multiple years of
Medicare claims data for beneficiaries receiving post-acute care to study access and outcomes of rehabilitation
services in the context of SDH. Our specific research aims are to:
 1. Evaluate RSA level PAC access for inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and home health related to
 acute hospital discharges for stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement and: a) how the association is
 moderated by urban and rural areas; b) how the association is moderated by racial and ethnic minority
 resident density; c) how the association is moderated by COVID.
 2. Characterize SDH based on area social, economic, education, physical, and healthcare context variables
 and evaluate a) the association between SDH and access to PAC settings across RSAs for those with
 stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement; b) how this association is modified by Covid; c) how this
 association is modified by urban rural context.
 3. Evaluate the association between SDH variables and successful community discharge and readmission
 among those with stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement and: a) how the associations are moderated
 by urban and rural areas; b) how the associations are moderated by racial and ethnic minority resident
 density; c) how the associations are moderated by COVID.
Impact and Need: This project has potential to impact both policies related to post-acute care delivery and the
day-to-day operations of post-acute care management. Equity in care has been at the forefront of healthcare
discussions over the past several years highlighted by noted disparity issues with the COVID pandemic.
Disparities continue to disproportionately affect racial minorities across all aspects of rehabilitation, supporting
the need for more research examining both individual and community factors to address care and outcome
inequities. The project takes a broad look at SDH for older adults’ access and outcomes for PAC in urban and
rural areas pre and post the COVID pandemic and will inform future use of individual and ecological SDH
variables for examining PAC access and outcomes. Findings will inform policy makers about the influence of
ecological social determinants of health have on post-acute care. With this information, policy makers can
adjust reimbursement formulae, reduce barriers by creating incentives to improve availability and accessibility
of post-acute care in areas where PAC utilization is positively and negatively influenced by social determinants
of health, and set policies aimed at addressing the root causes behind inequities due to SDH."
10863341,"Project Summary/Abstract - Antibody, Epitope, and Machine Learning Core
The overall goal of the Center is to develop vaccine candidates against prototype viruses in the bunyavirus,
paramyxovirus, and picornavirus families in order to prevent future pandemics that may stem from these viral
families. In support of this goal, the scientific core proposed will nominate and map epitopes for vaccine and
antibody design, utilize computation and machine learning to predict both key viral antigen epitopes to target as
well as how those viral antigens may evolve, and develop antibodies capable of detecting critical epitopes, which
will serve as research reagents for studying prototype viruses and tracking viral evolution. These activities will
support other projects in the Center by refining the choice of vaccine immunogens, providing the ability to
scalably characterize which epitopes of a given antigen elicit the strongest immune responses after challenge,
generating antibody panels to viral antigens to use as research reagents, and predicting how viral antigens may
mutate to escape immune recognition. The capabilities of the proposed scientific core will not only provide

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly aggressive and uniformly lethal in the metastatic setting
despite recent approvals of immuno-therapeutics for this disease. Outcomes could potentially be improved by
closing gaps in our understanding of immunological control of TNBC. A subset of human TNBCs (6-20%) strongly
overexpress the immune receptor VISTA (V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation), which bears
close homology to the drug target PD-L1. Clinical trials in humans are now evaluating the safety and efficacy of
targeting VISTA’s extracellular domain for cancer. However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how VISTA
signals to the interior of the cell. Preliminary data show that VISTA+ TNBCs have immunologically “cold” tumor
microenvironments and decreased proliferative index. These effects are controlled by both the extracellular and
intracellular domains of VISTA. By purifying proteins bound to the intracellular domain, we have established that
VISTA can recruit and sequester cytoplasmic clathrin-adaptor proteins, causing defects in plasma membrane
receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Consequently, important immunological and cancer growth receptors like
TLR4 and EGFR do not function effectively when VISTA is expressed. This leads to the hypothesis that VISTA’s
intracellular domain is a cell-intrinsic repressor of membrane receptor trafficking and that targeting both VISTA’s
extracellular and intracellular domains is critical to improve VISTA therapeutics.
 This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) To mechanistically dissect how VISTA blocks
receptor trafficking, we will characterize how proteins bind to VISTA’s intracellular domain; (2) Define the
mechanistic roles of VISTA’s intracellular domain binding partners in receptor trafficking and activity; and (3)
Evaluate therapeutic strategies for VISTA+ triple-negative breast cancers. These aims will be accomplished
through biochemical analysis of purified proteins and cell lines with engineered mutations to disrupt clathrin
adaptor binding to VISTA’s intracellular domain. Analysis will include the effects of VISTA in both tumor cells that
overexpress VISTA to model human TNBCs and immune cells that naturally express VISTA for normal
physiology. Combination regimens to explore the effects of blocking both extracellular and intracellular functions
of VISTA will be tested in immunocompetent mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer.
 This work should address the need to develop novel immunomodulatory agents to improve outcomes for
TNBC. Although VISTA-targeted therapeutics are currently in clinical development, all current approaches
exclusively target VISTA’s extracellular domain. Our studies have discovered that VISTA’s intracellular domain
is a critical determinant of receptor function that we propose to extensively characterize to catalyze improved
VISTA-targeted therapies."

Conceptual or semantic knowledge refers to information about objects, actions, relations, self, culture, and
includes meanings of words and phrases. The use of this knowledge is pervasive and automatic in daily life.
Everyday activities such as communication, recognition and use of objects, social interactions, and decision
making are crucially reliant on conceptual knowledge. Impairment of this complex and widely distributed
system has serious consequences for quality of life. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are
associated with the impairment of this system, including stroke with aphasia, dementias, temporal lobe
epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. Understanding the structure and organization of this system, and the
specific ways it is disrupted in these individuals, is critical for developing better treatments and rehabilitation
strategies. The goal of this research is to understand the structure and use of this information, its neural basis,
and the ways in which it can be impaired by neuropathology. Here, we focus on a brain region that has
emerged as a core component of the conceptual system: anterior temporal lobe. This brain region has been
the subject of intense research for over two decades not just in semantics, but in a number of other domains
such as social cognition, sentence processing, and naming of familiar people and places. This has generated a
rich and complex set of findings, some of which are often difficult to reconcile with each other. Insights into the
function of this region that can shed light on its role in myriad functions would clearly be very valuable. Using
neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and studies of patients with stroke, we examine predictions of
a novel theory that can account for many findings relating to the anterior temporal lobe. The proposed
experiments will shed new light on the organization and function of this core semantic region in the healthy and
impaired brain."
10839401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding communication among bacteria is a fundamental biological problem with critical
implications for public health, especially in the context of bacterial communities known as biofilms. While
bacteria are single-celled organisms, biofilms can exhibit many multicellular behaviors through
emergent coordination and dynamic cell-to-cell signaling. Such collective behaviors unique to biofilms
contribute to their ability to tolerate antibiotics and thrive in nearly any environment. While the advent of
next-generation sequencing has ushered in a new appreciation for the broad and ubiquitous roles of
bacteria in nature, our understanding of their molecular mechanisms of community coordination remains
in its infancy. My overarching goal is to understand how coordinated group behaviors arise in bacterial
biofilm communities through previously unexplored cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms, and how these
emergent behaviors impart functional community-level benefits. Specifically, over the next five years,
my group will use multiscale microscopy, high-throughput approaches, and quantitative genetics to
decipher how gene regulation, metabolic adaptation, and microenvironmental feedback give rise to
emergent coordination and multicellular behaviors in bacterial biofilms. With this MIRA award, my group
will explore these questions by focusing on model Bacillus subtilis biofilms, where we recently used a
multiscale microfluidic platform to discover that biofilm bacteria can engage in ion channel-mediated
electrochemical cell-to-cell signaling. This discovery, along with other unpublished phenomena
discovered by my group, make B. subtilis a powerful system for investigating how emergent behaviors
arise in bacterial biofilms from single-cell-level properties such as gene regulatory networks and
metabolic adaptation. Our data will inform quantitative models of multicellular phenomena, which will
give us a system-level understanding of multicellular behaviors in microbes, as well as suggesting new
ways to control biofilms."

The COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound impact on children globally, jeopardizing their sense of safety,
security, and behavioral health. In addition to COVID-19, millions of children are still recovering from recent
hurricanes that struck the southern the United States. Children exposed to climate-induced disasters (e.g.
hurricanes) are at a significant risk for mental and behavioral health challenges. Coupled with an enduring
pandemic, many of these children are disproportionately at risk for escalating mental health problems. Racial
and ethnic minority children who live in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods are among the most
vulnerable during and after large-scale disasters. They are more likely experience high levels of social and
material losses, displacement, and lack of access to mental and physical health services. Thus, there is a
critical need for these children to received accessible, empirically supported preventative interventions to
mitigate the onset of mental illness and behavioral health issues. Most post-disaster behavioral health
interventions are designed to treat rather than prevent mental health conditions and are often inaccessible to
racial and ethnic minority children living in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. The present study,
therefore, seeks to examine the implementation and efficacy of the COVID-19 adaptation of a disaster focused
empirically supported prevention intervention, the Journey of Hope (JoH), distributed by Save the Children, a
humanitarian organization serving socio-economically disadvantaged and racial and ethnic minority children in
communities dually impacted by COVID-19 and recent hurricanes that struck the Southern United States. The
long-term goals of this study are to: (1) respond to the critical need of accessible behavioral health
interventions designed to prevent and/or reduce COVID-19 related distress; and (2) provide an understanding
on how a COVID-19 tailored prevention intervention mitigates behavioral health disparities among racial and
ethnic minority children in high poverty settings who have been exposed to multiple large scale disasters. In a
pragmatic randomized control trial with 800 children between 3-8th grade, we seek to: Aim 1: Evaluate the
efficacy of the COVID-19 adapted JoH (JoH-C19) in preventing behavioral health and interpersonal problems
among socio-economically disadvantaged and racial and ethnic minority children who have been exposed to
multiple large-scale disasters relative to a healthy life-style attention control condition. Aim 2: Examine if
hypothesized mechanisms of change variables (social connectedness, adaptive coping, self-efficacy) mediate
intervention effects (JoH-C19 vs attention control) on child individual behavioral health and interpersonal
outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the moderating impact of COVID-19 related stressors on behavioral health
outcomes among children who participate in JoH-C19 versus the control condition. Aim 4: Explore
implementation barriers, facilitators, and acceptability of the JoH-C19 within school and afterschool settings
and delivered by community and school-based counselors."

The Training Program at the Interface of Reproductive Sciences and Bioengineering will unite two long-standing
areas of research excellence on the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign campus—reproductive biology and
engineering - to train predoctoral students to conduct innovative and high-quality research at the forefront of
reproductive biology. This unique educational program will blend techniques from biological sciences and
engineering to provide training in research areas that align with the mission of NICHD, and includes studies of
germ cell development/meiosis, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function, spermatogenesis & fertilization,
embryo-uterine crosstalk & pregnancy, and placentation & preterm birth. Engineering principles that present
exciting opportunities to transform research in reproductive sciences are studies involving novel three-
dimensional cell culture in natural or synthetic matrices and assembly of organoids to better understand the
function and interaction of cells in reproductive tissues, mechanobiology to better understand the relationships
between the microstructure, mechanical properties and function of the reproductive tissues, and innovations in
diagnostic methods such as advanced imaging and biosensors to assess placental development and function
during pregnancy. Twenty-four faculty members from 14 departments or interdisciplinary research institutes
across 4 colleges will serve as preceptors for the Training Program, making this a truly interdisciplinary program.
Participating faculty are well-funded and clearly have the necessary research support to provide current and
future trainees excellent training opportunities. There are 50 federally funded research grants totaling over 8.6
million dollars/year in direct costs, and 5 grants from other sources totaling over half million dollars/year in direct
costs among the 24 preceptors of this proposal. Trainees will be drawn from exceptionally strong graduate
programs across various departments, which altogether have over 1,787 total predoctorates. Of these
predoctorates, 103 work with the participating faculty, of which, 38 are eligible to participate in this training
program. This will enable the program to select high-quality predoctorates, expose them to cutting-edge and
emerging technologies that can advance progress in reproductive research, and train them to become the next
generation of interdisciplinary leaders. Selection of the 6 predoctoral trainees supported by this Program is based
on academic success, strength of the proposed research, and relevance of the research to Program goals.
Training will include Curricular Activities to ensure breadth across disciplines. It will also focus on trainees’
professional development and prepare them with the skill set to succeed in their careers. This unique program,
which enjoys strong institutional support and commitment, is designed to ensure that our trainees are fully
equipped to meet the challenges required to succeed in any professional environment such as academia,
industry, or government."

The primary goal of the enhanced Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (eMCDB) Training Program
at UC Davis is to ensure the success of our diverse predoctoral Trainees in graduate school and prepare them
for impactful careers in the biomedical workforce by nurturing productive, rigorous, resilient scientists and
confident communicators. A secondary goal of the eMCDB Program is to enhance the training and career
development of a broad cohort of PhD students at UC Davis by extending our activities far beyond our
Program.
A dynamic and experienced team of 63 Faculty Trainers from 18 academic departments will provide our
training. These trainers, carefully selected from the top molecular, cellular, and developmental biologists on
campus, offer wide-ranging interdisciplinary training in basic and translational life science research. Each has
an active research program, a successful track record of mentoring, and a commitment to fostering safe,
inclusive, and supportive training environments. Trainees are selected from the most qualified graduate
students across five affiliated Graduate Groups through a holistic process that recognizes and values their own
cultural individualities. Training is accomplished by integrating Graduate Group coursework and mentored PhD
dissertation research in individual laboratories with a coherent set of curricular and training activities developed
by this Program to support each Trainee’s growth along six skillsets critical for graduate training and lifelong
career progression: scientific rigor, communication, wellness and resilience, mentoring, career development,
and diversity. The effectiveness of our Program’s activities will be regularly and rigorously evaluated to allow
Program leadership to adapt and ensure that Program goals are met. Our activities, whenever possible, will be
offered to all graduate students in biological sciences at UC Davis, consistent with our goal to enhance training
and career development broadly, and in an effort to build community.
We are confident that this Training Program will thoroughly prepare our Trainees for the changing technical
and intellectual climate faced by the next generation of basic biomedical scientists. This Training Program
requests support for 16 predoctoral student slots to support eight Trainees for two years each, during the
second and third year of their PhD training. Institutionally, UC Davis has made major commitments to establish
a vibrant faculty and cutting-edge infrastructure to support research in molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology. The substantial institutional support allocated to this Training Program further reflects our shared goals
to deliver outstanding, high-quality graduate training for eMCDB Trainees and our commitment to support the
development of the national biomedical research workforce."

 The germ line is the cell lineage that gives rise to gametes and as such is of substantial practical and
scholarly significance. Germ cells can constitute a source of stem cells for tissue replacement, and understanding
their development is relevant for fertility and reproduction issues. Thus, in addition to the interest at the level of the
basic science, knowledge of germline biology is applicable for medicine and agriculture. Recent major advances in
the field were made in different model organisms and in human making it critical that researchers from diverse
arenas be brought together to share and discuss their discoveries.
 This proposal seeks support for the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth of a biennial series of meetings held
at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that is the premiere meeting for this field. The 2020 Germ Cells meeting will be
held on September 29th-October 3rd and based on the attendance at previous meetings we expect to 250-300
participants from around the world. There are no competing similar forums for all aspects of germ cell research.
 Broad topics for platform presentations include the molecular mechanisms controlling germ cell
specification and the control over the germ-cell fate, germ cell differentiation into gametes, germline stem cells,
meiosis, epigenetics, and presentations relevant for the human germline. The sessions will be chaired by experts
in the corresponding fields, providing young scientists with the opportunity to present their work. In addition, very
short “flash talks” will provide the participants with highlights from the poster sessions. Ample opportunity for
informal interactions will also be ensured."
10838458,"Project Summary
The heightened incidence of opioid use during pregnancy in the wake of the ongoing opioid crisis motivates this
targeted investigation into the impact of prenatal opioid exposure. Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms
through which prenatal opioid exposure produces systemic inflammation and immunosuppressive phenotypes
later in life. This result is consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) followed by the
corresponding compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) that restricts harmful systemic
immune responses. Recent studies have implicated the role of microbial dysbiosis in systemic inflammation and
epigenetic modifications of macrophages in CARS-mediated immunosuppression. Specifically, adult models
have shown that following chronic opioid exposure, gut microbial dysbiosis initiates TLR4-induced systemic
inflammation. Opioid use during pregnancy results in gut dysbiosis that is strongly correlated with diversity and
taxonomy of the infant microbiome. Taken together, it is plausible that prenatal opioid exposure results in
neonatal gut microbial dysbiosis which contributes to systemic inflammation. Surprisingly, probiotic therapy does
not fully attenuate opioid-induced immune dysfunction, suggesting other mechanisms at play that contribute to
immunosuppressive phenotypes following SIRS such as epigenetic modifications of macrophages. H3K9me2
modifications in the IL-1β and TNFα promoters of macrophages following SIRS have commonly been described;
adult models of chronic opioid use have largely limited their analysis of these modifications to brain tissue where,
promisingly, differential expression of H3K9me2 modifications in several brain regions has been shown. Given
these preliminary findings, this project aims to study these modifications on a cellular level in intestinal
macrophages. I hypothesize that prenatal opioid exposure results in microbial dysbiosis, which
contributes to systemic inflammation; additionally, opioid-induced systemic inflammation that persists
postnatally alters the epigenome of intestinal macrophages which further perpetuates immune
dysfunction. To date, there have been no reported studies on how prenatal opioid exposure affects the gut
microbiome or how opioid-induced inflammation leads to epigenetic modifications of macrophages. Thus, the
goal of this project is to characterize immune dysfunction following prenatal opioid exposure and to define
underlying mechanisms through the following two Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine how alterations in the gut
microbiome following prenatal opioid exposure contribute to systemic inflammation by examining gut microbial
and metabolome composition, gut barrier integrity, and TLR4-induced systemic inflammation. Aim 2.
Characterize immune dysfunction following prenatal opioid exposure and the effects of opioid-induced
inflammation on H3K9me2 modifications in intestinal macrophages. Collectively, this proposal will contribute an
in-depth understanding of immune dysfunction following prenatal opioid exposure and will provide the first
insights into epigenetic and microbiome regulation of immune dysfunction."

10852952,"Summary:
Delivering antibiotics (or other drugs) at effective and safe concentrations to unstable, critically ill hospitalized
patients is a daunting problem – for example, for all six antibiotics that are the focus of this work, pharmacokinetic
studies reveal truly wide discrepancies between predicted and actual active concentrations. While important
strides have been made to help physicians make decisions that are most likely to help, and least likely to harm,
an important cornerstone for such approaches is still missing: There are no clinically validated devices that can
rapidly, accurately and precisely measure concentrations of drugs in a manner that would address the long turn-
around-times and prohibitive cost of the central-laboratory-based approach to high-frequency therapeutic drug
monitoring. We approach the problem systematically from the bottom up by building and validating at each step
each of the components needed to overcome such barriers.
As our first challenge (and our first Aim), we focus on high-quality receptors – well characterized and validated
on their own – which could then be widely used and implemented by other groups in different formats, by simply
being ordered “off the shelf”. We identified oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) as such reagents.
Building on our vast preliminary results, we delineate a process that will lead to isolation of sets of receptors,
with each candidate validated on its own in a fluorescent format against gold-standard analytical methods in
patient-derived fluids, under conditions that allow these simple sensors to be applied directly in mix-and-measure
formats (e.g., dialysis effluents, ultrafiltered sera, and extracts from standard SPE columns).
Our second challenge, exacerbated by the highly variable nature of samples collected from critically ill patients,
is cross-reactivity and deviations from standardized conditions. We address these by identifying pairs of
aptamers with orthogonal properties for each antibiotic: One of the aptamers will be used in biosensor modules
(Aim 2) under strictly controlled conditions in conjunction with a commonly used nanomaterial (graphene) and
validated on dialysis effluents and extracts from SPE columns (here, biosensors can be used without pre-
purification) against gold-standard chromatographic methods. The other aptamer from the pair, from an unrelated
family, will be comprehensively validated as the affinity component of extraction modules (Aim 3) on spiked
commercial samples of sera and actual samples from critically ill patients.
Through this approach, we will provide rigorously characterized, standardized components for analysis of
polymyxins, fluoroquinolones, daptomycin, linezolid, and beta lactams, which will enable us (and others) to
combine components into devices, either to be used at the bedside, or as cartridges in automatized analyzers.
In either case, these will facilitate routine high-frequency drug monitoring outside of large, academic hospital
settings. We expect to demonstrate one design of multi-modular devices by the end of this funding period."
10831479,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Molecular simulations complement experiments by revealing the microscopic dynamics
underlying biological mechanisms and the forces promoting those dynamics. However, most biological processes
involve time scales much longer than the time step of numerical integration. While there are many methods for
bridging this separation of time scales to obtain equilibrium averages, further advances are needed to robustly
estimate dynamical statistics. The proposed research seeks to develop general methods that can meet this need
and to apply them to elucidating self-assembly mechanisms at both molecular and cellular length scales.
 Improving insulin therapies through rare-event analyses of short simulations. There is a pandemic in diabetes
mellitus, with tremendous cost worldwide. The main treatment is insulin therapy, but it has a narrow therapeutic
index, and its requirement for refrigerated transport and storage is prohibitively costly for much of the world.
Insulin analogs have been engineered to have speciﬁc pharmacokinetics based on knowledge of insulin self-
association, but an understanding of how insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) remains lacking. We seek to
develop computational methods that can enable simulation and analysis of coupled folding and binding reactions
and to combine these methods with recently obtained structures of IR bound to insulin and single-chain insulin
(SCI) analogs to elucidate the microscopic origins of observed therapeutic activities. The study can thus ultimately
lead to improved insulin therapies. We will also investigate the improved thermal properties of SCI analogs, in
particular, their reduced tendency to form amyloid ﬁbrils. The study thus also promises to yield insights into
amyloid formation, with broad implications beyond insulin to neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's diseases.
 Modeling cytoskeletal processes leading to developmental patterning. Cytoskeletal dynamics underlie diverse
processes, including developmental patterning, neuronal synapse formation, immunological recognition, wound
healing, and tumor growth. These dynamics can be very hard to intuit because they involve balances of me-
chanical forces, mechanochemistry, network assembly and dissasembly, and feedback to and from cell signaling
molecules. Models thus play an important role in parsing contributing molecular processes and testing quanti-
tative hypotheses. We will adapt a recently parameterized cytoskeletal model that is quantitatively predictive in
vitro to elucidate mechanisms of developmental patterning in vivo. Namely, we will investigate how interactions
between the small GTPase RhoA and actin assembly/dissasembly control pulsatile contractility, a widespread
phenomenon that drives cortical ﬂow, cell shape change, and tissue deformation. Then we will compare models
for the localization of the evolutionarily-conserved RNA-binding protein Staufen during anterior-posterior speci-
ﬁcation. In addition to aiding in understanding these key developmental processes, the simulations will yield a
model that can be used to study cytoskeletal dynamics in a broad range of contexts with minimal modiﬁcation."

The long term goal of our laboratory is to study the pathogenic mechanisms induced by
environmental toxicants, genetic mutations and gene-environment interactions in Parkinson’s
disease (PD) with the ultimate goal of developing disease-modifying therapeutics for this brain
disorder. Overall, our research projects address the following fundamental questions: 1) Gene-
environment interactions: Do mutations linked to PD render dopamine neurons more susceptible
to environmental toxicants? 2) Glia-neuron interactions: How do glial cells contribute to the
vulnerability of dopamine neurons in PD? 3) Excessive mitochondrial fission has been
demonstrated in genetic and toxicant-induced models of PD. Can mitochondrial fission and fusion
be targeted for PD treatment? These research projects have been supported by NIEHS since
2006. This R35 proposal will be built upon the strength, expertise, experimental models and other
resources generated from the NIEHS funded projects in our laboratory to take our work to the
next transformative level. The primary goal of this R35 proposal is to demonstrate that
neurotoxicity induced by neurotoxicants such as manganese (Mn) alone or in combination with
other factors (α-synuclein and gastric bacteria) linked to PD can be mitigated by reducing the
function of dynamin related protein-1 (Drp1), which is typically known as a mitochondrial fission
protein. However, our recent findings have led us to unexpected and exciting mechanism of Drp1
through autophagy. Combined with our recent discoveries that neurotoxicants such as Mn and
paraquat impair autophagy at a low and sub-lethal concentration, our vision is that Drp1 plays a
central role in pathogenic mechanism and this protein can be targeted for PD therapy. Over the
next eight years, this R35 will give us the flexibility and power to fully investigate the extensive
involvement of Drp1 in neurotoxicity mediated by glia-neuron interactions, gene-environment
interactions and gastric bacteria that have been linked to PD. This proposal utilizes a
transdisciplinary approach from a team of accomplished investigators with relevant established
track-records, a wide range of chemical and genetic tools, high standard techniques and
innovative experimental models for molecular target manipulations with functional studies at
cellular, circuit and whole animal levels. Completion of this project will provide paradigm shifts in
our understanding of how Drp1 mediates neurotoxicity through a wide range of toxic insults."
10831481,"Lesions to articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone eventually lead to osteoarthritis, a debilitating
disease with no cure. A successful therapy will need to promote tissue regeneration, support integrative repair,
and protect the surrounding tissue from further degeneration. The overarching goal for this project is to develop
a mechanically competent, stem cell-based regenerative approach to treat osteochondral (OC) defects. During
the initial funding period, our team developed an OC-mimetic hydrogel with a design that decoupled the load-
bearing (i.e., structural) component from the soft cellular biomimetic component. This allowed us to create a
functionally graded, stiff structure with cartilage-matched mechanical stiffness, while creating soft cellular niches
that supported mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Building from key in vitro milestones, this renewal
aims to translate the OC-mimetic hydrogel in vivo. We will test the hypothesis that the OC-mimetic hydrogel
induces rapid and targeted differentiation of exogeneous MSCs in vivo, enabling their direct participation in OC-
tissue regeneration while simultaneously protecting and supporting integration with the surrounding tissue. A
new feature of our design is a cement line-mimetic within the structural support that similar to the native
cement line will be impervious to cell migration across the cartilage-bone interface, but pervious to nutrient
transport. This will protect the MSCs in the cartilage layer, enabling their rapid differentiation and contribution to
regeneration. We will test the overarching hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim1, we will identify
mechanotransduction pathways that differentially control MSC fate in the OC-mimetic hydrogel, which will
allow us to establish a mechanistic understanding of the physiochemical cues that achieve robust MSC
differentiation in a dynamic environment with loading. In Aim 2, we will determine MSC fate in vivo within the
OC-mimetic hydrogel after implantation in a rat OC defect model by tracking differentially labeled MSCs isolated
from DsRed+ and GFP+ rats. This aim will confirm MSC fate and their direct and indirect contribution to OC-tissue
regeneration. In Aim 3, we will create a structural support that undergoes surface degradation to maintain its
mechanical properties. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this fully degradable and mechanically
competent OC-mimetic hydrogel using three models of increasing complexity: an OC explant defect model to
monitor the health of and integration with articular cartilage adjacent to the defect as the support structure
degrades; a rat OC defect model for longitudinal studies to monitor in vivo degradation of the structure
concomitant with tissue regeneration and integrative repair; and, testing in a pre-clinical animal (swine) model.
At the conclusion of this project, we expect to have (1) advanced our fundamental understanding of the
mechanotransduction pathways in MSCs and their fate in vivo and (2) established a mechanically competent
and degradable OC-mimetic hydrogel that achieves OC-tissue regeneration and integrative repair, while
maintaining joint health."
10859559,"ABSTRACT
One of the greatest advances in pediatric brain tumor management has been the incorporation of tumor
molecular findings in the diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and treatment of patients. Because of this, treatment
options and outcomes for patients with specific alterations, including structural variants (SVs) resulting in fusions,
have greatly improved. However, despite multiple research studies that show SVs are important for tumor
development, maintenance, and progression, clinical analyses are generally limited to targeted gene sequencing
panels (DNA +/- RNA) and targeted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). This type of testing is sufficient for
brain tumors that harbor classic genomic alterations, but inadequate for tumors that have atypical histological or
molecular aberrations, oftentimes resulting in “negative” genomic testing. In addition, some of these tests have
a long turnaround time, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. We are in great need for a clinical test that
will allow for more accurate and rapid discovery of clinically significant SVs that can be used along with
sequencing to create treatment plans with maximum benefit. Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) is a promising
genomic technology that can help fill this molecular diagnostic gap. Our preliminary data utilizing about 60
pediatric brain tumor samples demonstrates the utility of OGM to identify previously known diagnostic SVs (i.e.,
BRAF-fusion), cryptic SVs that were not identified by clinical tests, and novel SVs that have never been described
in pediatric brain tumors. Although novel in the field of pediatric brain tumors, OGM is being used clinically as a
CLIA/CAP certified diagnostic test for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD), a disorder that
previously required southern blotting for diagnosis. More recently, the Augusta University Pathology Department
submitted a successful Laboratory Developed Test application for OGM as a diagnostic test for hematologic
malignancies to the American Medical Association. We propose to implement optical genome mapping (OGM)
as a first line diagnostic approach for pediatric brain tumors in a clinical setting and utilize OGM to discover
genomic SVs with potential clinical relevance. This study will be the first to generate pre-clinical evidence that
brain tumor-driving genetic alterations can be rapidly identified using OGM, with the potential to guide clinical
treatment plans for children with these tumors. By the end of the study period, OGM will be validated in CLIA/CAP
certified laboratories (Children’s National Hospital Pathology, Bionano Laboratories, Augusta University), and a
laboratory developed test application submitted pending promising results. This study will also utilize OGM for
the discovery of novel pathogenic SVs in a large cohort of pediatric brain tumors samples, which may be used
to improve diagnosis, allow for better outcome prediction, and ultimately advance therapies for affected children
with brain tumors. The results of this study will have a direct impact on clinical care without requiring a clinical
trial. Although this study will primarily focus on pediatric brain tumors, OGM can also be applied to other tumor
types, expanding the therapeutic possibilities for children and adults diagnosed with these cancers."
10859560,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intestinal failure results from conditions such as trauma-related small bowel injury, necrotizing enterocolitis, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment options are limited; however, an important emerging therapeutic
approach is intestinal transplantation (IT). When successful, IT is associated with marked improvements in
quality of life and overall well-being. However, its current success rate is <60% 5 years post-transplant, and there
are multiple factors that limit its clinical use. The major impedance to more successful transplants is donor
tissues' limited tolerance to current storage methods. The current standard, static cold storage (CS), has been
shown to cause epithelial damage after 6 hours (hr) as well as inflammation and loss of epithelial tight junctions.
Indeed, clinical studies show that intestinal allograft preservation of >6 hr of cold ischemic time correlates with a
progressively higher rate of recipient post-reperfusion syndrome, translocation of enteric bacteria that cause
systemic infections, induction of inflammation, and increased transplant failure. Thus, methods that could
improve graft viability and organ preservation, especially reducing the incidence and severity of ischemia-
reperfusion injury could have a major impact on enhancing the IT success rate, making it the preferred therapy
for intestinal failure patients. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has shown promise in clinical heart, lung,
and liver transplant scenarios, but this potentially groundbreaking advancement has not been developed for
intestinal failure. We have performed highly promising preliminary studies using NMP in porcine and human
intestine and have shown compared to CS: 1) Successful allogeneic transplantation with fewer histologic signs
of epithelial reperfusion injury, enhanced intestinal stem cell activation, and histologic evidence of active
epithelial restitution and regeneration in 6 hr NMP-stored porcine small intestine. 2) Histologically intact epithelial
barrier in 6 hr NMP-stored human donor small intestine. We hypothesize that intestinal NMP will reduce
ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity and function and decreasing inflammation,
thereby minimizing factors that prime the graft for failure. We will use an ex vivo pig intestinal tissue and a porcine
model of IT to address the hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the extent to which
NMP protects epithelial cell integrity and regenerative potential to enhance barrier function. Aim 2. To determine
if NMP minimizes allograft inflammatory activation and the cellular mechanisms mediating pro- and anti-
inflammatory processes during allograft storage. Aim 3. To determine if NMP enhances the suitability of injured
intestine for transplantation. Successful completion of these aims will develop a mechanistic basis to enhance
intestinal allograft function by mitigating preservation injury and will address the practical limiting factor of the
number of grafts suitable for transplant. This could dramatically expand the applicability of IT to patients with
intestinal failure and lead to an enhanced quality of life for these individuals."

infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death. However, the inflammatory response pathways
and molecular mechanisms that underlie the disease remain largely unresolved. Autophagy of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER-phagy) serves as a disposal pathway for misfolded proteins and has been implicated in various
diseases, including diabetes, cancer, metabolic diseases, and some neurological disorders. Using ER-phagy
receptor Fam134b knockout mice, we have identified a novel and essential role of ER-phagy in the host
immune response during sepsis. Our findings indicate that depletion of FAM134B entirely abolished NLRP3
(Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-Like Receptor containing Pyrin domain 3) inflammasome activation
and the generation of IL-1β in macrophages. Additionally, Fam134b knockout mice exhibited higher survival
rates, less lung injury, lower bacterial load, and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in experimental
models of sepsis. Notably, septic patients show upregulation of NLRP3 gene in peripheral blood monocytes
and elevated levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the blood. We propose the central hypothesis that sepsis induces
macrophage ER-phagy, driving NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cytokine release, and inflammatory tissue
injury. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including intravital microscopy, adoptive macrophage
transplantation, and macrophage RNA sequencing, to investigate these hypotheses and validate them in
human sepsis samples. Our proposal is organized into three specific aims. 1) To define the role of macrophage
ER-phagy in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and lung inflammatory injury during sepsis. 2) To decipher the
molecular mechanisms by which ER-phagy drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 3) To test the therapeutic
potential of targeting macrophage ER-phagy for the treatment of septic injury. The successful completion of our
proposed studies has significant potential to impact the future development of novel therapeutic strategies for
bacterial sepsis, ultimately improving patient outcomes and decreasing the burden of this life-threatening
disease on global healthcare systems."

Many patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continue to
experience a constellation of symptoms long after the initial illness. Known as “long-COVID”, or Post-
Acute Sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection (PASC), the most frequently reported symptoms are fatigue,
post exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction, which are also the primary symptoms of Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Many of the PASC patients fulfill diagnostic
criteria for ME/CFS, but differ from non-PASC ME/CFS patients in that they share a common infectious
trigger and have a shorter duration of illness, which reduces heterogeneity. Understanding whether
PASC ME/CFS shares overlapping mechanisms with non-PASC ME/CFS is critical, as this could
provide insights into the mechanisms and inform treatment strategies of ME/CFS in general. To address
this question, we propose a comparison study of PASC ME/CFS patients with sudden onset illness to
non-PASC ME/CFS patients who reported a sudden flu-like illness onset. Limited studies have shown
reductions in cerebral blood flow and increased cerebroventricular lactate in ME/CFS patients
suggesting alterations in perfusion and metabolic properties. Our recent preliminary results show that
the oxygen extraction fraction was elevated in PASC ME/CFS patients, which may be attributed to
reduced cerebral blood flow and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this project, we aim to conduct non-
invasive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare the similarities and differences in
cerebral oxygen and glucose metabolism between the two patient groups as well as healthy controls.
We will measure and compare the oxygen extraction fraction, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral
metabolic rate of oxygen and glucose uptake and metabolic rate in the patient groups and healthy
controls. The MRI derived parameters will then be correlated to the disease symptom burden. Additional,
since many PASC patients recover over one year, we aim to perform a follow-up study on the PASC
and non-PASC ME/CFS groups. Completion of this timely and important study will provide comparison
of PASC and non-PASC ME/CSF in terms of changes in glucose and oxygen metabolic properties, as
well as how these imaging parameters are related to the disease burden. Through analysis of the
longitudinal data, we will be able to determine whether the changes in metabolic properties are
associated with changes of patient reported outcome measures. The knowledge learned will deepen
our understanding of the ME/CFS/PASC (long-COVID) disease mechanisms, aid in ME/CFS diagnosis,
inform treatment decisions, and inspire new treatment targets."

Targeting transient or highly dynamic states of biomolecules with small molecule drugs is a major challenge that
must be overcome to advance therapeutic design for human diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
cancer, and viral infections. Studying biomolecules that rapidly change shape or that adopt targetable structures
infrequently is a task that is well suited to theoretical investigations in the context of computer-aided drug design.
Simulation methods can relate structure to energy, and can provide quantitative descriptions of how small
molecules modulate biomolecular structure and dynamics. Our laboratory applies polarizable molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to amyloidogenic proteins and G-quadruplexes (GQs), for which the effects of
induced electronic polarization are critical for describing their dynamics. In this application, we propose a
research program that seeks to advance drug design efforts against (1) monomeric and membrane-embedded,
oligomeric amyloidogenic proteins and (2) G-quadruplexes involved in cancer and viral infections. Throughout
these investigations, we focus on the role of induced electronic polarization and electric fields in driving
conformational change and ligand binding. We base these efforts on our previous discoveries in how induced
polarization influences critical behaviors in these systems and how electric fields exerted within the biomolecules
may drive fundamental behaviors. During the project period, we propose to employ cutting-edge strategies for
investigating the conformational ensembles of several amyloidogenic peptides in aqueous and phospholipid
membranes. We will use structural insights from these simulations to propose new targets for small-molecule
design. Similarly, we will investigate structurally diverse GQs in the presence and absence of known ligands to
understand the factors driving ligand binding. We will expand upon these efforts with simulations and virtual
screening efforts that aim to design new small molecules that will bind GQs with greater specificity than is
possible with generic aromatic features. In both of these projects, we will conduct experimental validation of
proposed high-affinity compounds using a variety of spectroscopic and biophysical methods. The specific goals
for the five-year project period are to (1) determine the conformational free energy landscapes of amyloidogenic
proteins and identify dynamic targets and (2) identify substates of GQ ensembles that can be used for high-
affinity small-molecule design. These projects reflect the overall vision of the research program, which is to apply
the most accurate models and rigorous methods to investigate biomolecular dynamics at the atomic level to
understand the molecular basis of disease and to intervene with small-molecule therapeutics."

Understanding the human brain and its diseases represents an enormous challenge but also an opportunity for
improving human health. One of the many remarkable attributes of the normal brain is its ability to store and
retrieve information for a lifetime of learning and memories. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias
(ADRDs) disrupt these cognitive functions and have enormous personal, familial, and societal costs,
compounded by a disturbing absence of disease-modifying therapies despite scores of scientific theories, billions
of dollars, decades of research, and hundreds of failed clinical trials. This transformative proposal will meet
these challenges through studies on a newly identified molecular mechanism within the brain: somatic gene
recombination (SGR). SGR may alter individual genomes within each neuron by linking neural activity – both
normal and abnormal – to functional DNA gene sequences present within the genomes of post-mitotic neurons.
We hypothesize that through retro-insertion of RNA sequences, genomic cDNAs (gencDNAs) are formed. We
identified thousands of gene variants for just a single gene – the AD gene, APP – which offers new explanations
for disease progression and the failure of AD therapeutics thus far. This proposal will explore the links between
SGR acting on other known or unknown disease loci in ADRDs and test the hypothesis that SGR dysregulation
represents a common pathogenic mechanism shared by AD and ADRDs.
Three areas of study will be pursued by a team of proven investigators empowered by world class ADRD,
neuroscience, and bioinformatics experts. First, we will define the machinery of SGR in the human brain by
identifying the involved genes and biochemically characterizing their function. Second, we will use targeted and
unbiased approaches to identify new genes undergoing SGR in ADRDs and characterize neuroanatomical
expression in relation to the classical hallmarks of the disease. Third, we will explore possible targets to be used
as biomarkers and for therapeutics in cell culture and human fluid samples. Importantly, these studies will
examine a potential near-term therapy for AD and ADRDs by studying FDA-approved reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. These proposed studies are the first to examine SGR in ADRDs and represent a new line of research.
The scope of this proposal presents a truly transformational study of the brain, its diseases, and the enormous
challenge of understanding and treating ADRDs."

The vast majority of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate severe and persistent
delays in language development that negatively impact their ability to form social relationships, succeed in
school, and achieve an optimal quality of life. Given the severity of language delays and their lasting impact,
many interventions have been developed to improve language skills in children with ASD. A central strategy in
such interventions is for adults to modify the way they speak to help children understand and learn from
spoken language—for example, by simplifying their utterances, relative to utterance length in adult
conversation. However, the field lacks controlled, experimental evidence regarding how linguistic simplification
impacts children’s ability to understand and learn from spoken language. This gap in knowledge poses a
significant barrier to evidence-based practice and scientific progress. Fortunately, our team has validated and
refined the tools needed to address the limitations of prior work. In the proposed study, we adopt the looking-
while-listening paradigm to examine real-time effects of utterance simplification on children’s language
processing and word learning. As a screen-based task, looking-while-listening has limited behavioral task
demands, making it appropriate for children with a wide range of abilities (including those who are minimally
verbal). The objective of the proposed project is to determine how linguistic simplification affects language
processing and word learning in young children with ASD. Participants will be 104 children with ASD (2 – 4
years old) with a broad range of abilities. Children will complete standardized assessments and looking-while-
listening tasks. Based on strong preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that simplification will negatively
affect processing and learning. This central hypothesis will be addressed by 3 Specific Aims: 1) Determine how
single-word and telegraphic simplification affects language processing in young children with ASD. 2)
Determine how single-word and telegraphic simplification affects word learning in young children with ASD. 3)
Evaluate child characteristics that may moderate the effects of linguistic simplification on language processing
and word learning in young children with ASD. Regardless of the outcome, these results will have a strong
impact on theory and clinical practice. Findings will be significant because they will determine how linguistic
simplification affects children’s ability to understand and learn from spoken language. This project will also
contribute to our long-term goal of systematically evaluating the components (and likely active ingredients) of
early language interventions."

Bipolar Disorder affects about 1 percent of the world population. We do not currently understand
the biological underpinnings of Bipolar Disorder well enough to design effective treatment
strategies. Twin and adoption studies support a genetic etiology and we now know this is
partitioned between both rare and common variants in hundreds of genes, each variant having a
small effect. The sample size required to more fully elucidate the genetic etiology of Bipolar
Disorder can only be achieved through large scale collaborative efforts. For instance, the 2018
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) Bipolar Disorder Genome-Wide Association Study
(GWAS) discovered 30 significant loci using samples with European ancestry. Although this is
an important milestone in understanding the genetics of Bipolar Disorder, collectively these loci
only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance.
Expansion of this approach to other population groups, with adequate sample size, is required
to discovery of additional genetic variants associated with Bipolar Disorder. We propose to
ascertain and collect 10,000 cases and 2,000 controls from Pakistan. We currently have an
ongoing study in Pakistan (GEN-SCRIP) that will collect an additional 10,000 controls. We have
formed a consortium of Pakistani psychiatrists at 11 centers. The 12,000 samples will be
genotyped at Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research with Illumina Global Screening Array
(GSA), which will contain a backbone of ~660,000 SNPs, which provides LD coverage and
imputation accuracy of >0.8, for over 87% of the South Asian genome. There is a strong
tradition of consanguineous marriages in Pakistan which has an advantage for genetic studies,
especially of recessively inherited traits. We will analyze these data for common SNPs,
haplotypes, and copy number variations (CNVs). In association analysis we will examine for
recessive inheritance, in addition to additive models of common variants to disease. We will
perform a homozygosity mapping to identify regions that are enriched for Runs of Homozygosity
(ROH) in cases, as compared to controls. This population will have a different linkage
disequilibrium structure which will help to narrow down the genomic intervals containing the
potential causative variants at the 30 loci identified in the PGC2 BP GWAS. We will share these
data with broader scientific community via the NIMH Genetics Repository and Genomic
Research, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and dbGaP."

The American Society of Biomechanics (ASB) is the foremost society for biomechanics research and
engagement in the United States. The Society’s annual meeting brings together an interdisciplinary group of
researchers interested in the application of mechanical principles to biological problems, both basic and applied.
The research portfolio of ASB’s membership is highly interdisciplinary and complements the missions of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research
(NCMRR) and National Institute on Aging (NIA) by fostering discovery and dissemination of scientific knowledge
through basic, translational, and clinical research that aims to enhance the health, productivity, independence,
and quality of life of people with physical disabilities, musculoskeletal diseases, and injuries, across the lifespan.
The 2024 annual meeting of the ASB, which will be held in Madison, Wisconsin, is being hosted by faculty at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. The meeting will feature a variety of activities designed to foster a lively
interchange of ideas, including podium presentations, thematic poster sessions, invited symposia, keynote
lectures, poster presentations, topical tutorials, laboratory tours and a variety of mentoring and diversity events.
Student participation and mentoring are priorities for the Society. Meeting attendance is anticipated to exceed
800 delegates, of which nearly half are expected to be students. Mechanisms have been established to
specifically encourage and support the participation of women, persons from underrepresented backgrounds,
and persons with disabilities.
Under the proposed award, the Society will continue to administer its successful Diversity Travel Award program,
add a Faculty Scholars Award program to add breadth in new institutions and geographical areas, and organize
four key events: (i.) a Mentorship Lunch focusing on guidance and professional development strategies for early-
career scientists; (ii.) a Women in Science event convening the women in the Society to offer strategies for
development across all career stages; (iii.) a Diversity and Inclusion Lunch bringing together members of the
Society to network across boundaries and discuss strategies to support those who face uphill battles to full
inclusion; and (iv.) a STEM Educational Outreach Program engaging underserved youth and persons with
disabilities in the local community through a biomechanics activities exposition.
This grant application seeks funding to continue supporting Diversity Travel Awards for ~16 attendees of the
meeting, five Faculty Scholar Awards, and facilities and transportation costs for the STEM Educational Outreach
Program. NIH-R13-supported programs were offered at the last six (2015-2023) in-person annual conferences,
including travel awards to a diverse group of individuals with disabilities, from underrepresented backgrounds,
or facing economic barriers to attendance. These awards have proven to be successful in increasing diversity
amongst young active members who over time will become the future leaders of the Society and the field."

Proper erythropoiesis requires coordinated changes in gene expression and protein synthesis for stem and
progenitor cells to differentiate and amass the striking amount of iron-laden hemoglobin required to sustain life
in humans. Anemia—insufficient circulating erythrocytes—is most frequently caused by iron deficiency which
remains one the most common nutritional deficit in the world. Beyond hemoglobin production, the role of iron in
other cellular processes during erythropoiesis, such as gene expression and RNA processing is poorly
understood. RNA processing events are mediated by RNA binding proteins, such as the poly C binding proteins
(PCBPs). PCBP2 regulates erythropoiesis via alternative splicing of gene transcripts that drive erythroid
differentiation programs. Surprisingly, PCBPs were also discovered to function as intracellular iron chaperones,
raising the question of whether iron-binding occurs independently of or in concert with RNA-binding. Given that
iron levels intimately modulate red blood cell differentiation, we sought to investigate whether PCBP activity is
modulated by iron in the context of red cell development. Specifically, we hypothesize that iron modulates the
affinity or specificity of PCBPs towards target RNAs causing changes in RNA splicing that are important for red
blood cell differentiation. We will address this hypothesis by i) determining the effect of iron on PCBP-RNA
interactions using unbiased high throughput in vitro assays, ii) evaluating the effect of iron on PCBP-regulated
RNA splicing events in cells, and iii) determine global gene expression and RNA splicing changes in primary
human and mouse samples with and without iron deficiency. From these experiments we will uncover iron-
sensitive RNA splicing programs that dictate erythropoiesis."

Our current research focuses on investigating the mechanisms by which fatty acids (the building blocks of the
plasma membrane) modulate the function of mechanosensitive ion channels. These ion channels transduce
mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals in all kingdoms of life. Members of the mechanosensitive ion
channel family (including the PIEZO channels) are involved in various physiological processes, including gentle
touch sensation, proprioception, musculoskeletal development, neuronal differentiation, cell volume, wound
healing, and food sensation. PIEZO channel dysfunction has a detrimental effect on human balance,
proprioception, skeletal development, mechanical allodynia, and erythrocyte volume. Since PIEZO channels play
critical roles in health and disease, it has become clear that modulating their function could have therapeutic
effects for a wide range of pathologies. Unfortunately, the pharmacology of PIEZO channels is in its infancy.
Hence, we envision that strategies fine-tuning PIEZO channel function will lay the groundwork for novel
pharmacological tools. In the past five years, we have identified dietary fatty acids that, when enriched in the
plasma membrane, fine-tune PIEZO channel mechanical responses in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Noteworthy,
we have utilized fatty acid-enriched diets to ameliorate the deficits associated with increased or reduced PIEZO2
function in mouse models of neurological disorders. Our goals for the next five years are to depict the molecular
mechanisms by which saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate the function of bacterial and
mammalian members of the mechanosensitive ion channel family and develop strategies to ameliorate channel-
associated disorders. Furthermore, we will uncover novel physiological roles of the PIEZO subfamily using the
animal model C. elegans. Our functional, behavioral, and genetic studies will uncover unifying themes underlying
the modulation of mechanosensitive ion channels by membrane composition and reveal novel physiological roles
of this family of ion channels."

translational science researchers at the postdoctoral level who will build a community of clinical and translational
scientists by leveraging the multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary strengths of a Center for Clinical and
Translational Sciences (CCTS) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) based at the University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTH-H). Through the TL1 Training Core which preceded this
application, which was awarded as part of the CCTS CTSA, we already have a successful record of training a
diverse and productive group of translational scientists.
 Historically, postdoctoral trainees supported by the TL1 Training Core have been employed at two major
institutions within the Texas Medical Center (TMC), UTH-H and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).
However, a unique aspect of our CCTS is the inclusion of partner institutions spanning the state of Texas. In this

partner institutions. This will bring additional diversity to the T32 since these trainees will draw upon the broad
racial, ethnic, gender, economic, and social backgrounds represented in Texas, which is thought to be a blueprint
for the nation's future demographics. Furthermore, the training faculty and their mentees at the CCTS partner
sites will bring awareness of unique research topics and collaborative opportunities to the forefront of the T32
trainee experience for those based in the TMC. The following aims will enable us to achieve our application
goals: Aim 1. Attract and retain postdoctoral trainees with potential to develop into leaders in translational
science; Aim 2. Leverage the strengths of the unique Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences ecosystem
to train postdoctoral fellows in principles of translational science; Aim 3. Enhance diversity among postdoctoral
trainees in translational science.
 We will achieve these aims by leveraging the world-class educational and research opportunities within the
TMC to train translational scientists across the state. By drawing upon the trainee diversity that is available in
our partner institutions that train postdoctoral fellows (Rice University, UT-RGV, UT-Tyler, and TT-EP), this
postdoctoral training program is uniquely positioned to create the translational science leaders of the future. We
anticipate this training will fill the need for creating a wide-ranging pool of translational scientists who are diverse,

Exposure to maternal depression in early life increases the risk of socioemotional and cognitive (SEC)
problems in childhood and over the lifecourse. This has led to the promotion of depression treatment as a
critical early childhood intervention. However, there is insufficient evidence on whether depression treatments
alone reduce offspring risk in low resource settings where other social and economic adversities are highly
prevalent. The proposed study in rural Pakistan will, first, examine the impact of a cluster randomized
intervention, extended to include both maternal depression and child development components, on child SEC
outcomes at ages 5-8. Second, we will closely examine the psychosocial and biological processes through
which maternal depression and other adversities lead to emerging SEC difficulties by continuing to follow the
mothers and children, currently in our study from birth to age three, through early primary school years.
Preliminary findings from our current study, consisting of a cluster-RCT examining the impact of a perinatal
maternal depression intervention on child development within a population representative birth cohort design,
have yielded several insights: (1) the “Thinking Healthy Program - Peer delivered” (THPP) shortened the initial
maternal depression episode but its longer term impact is unclear; (2) although the THPP did not have an
observable impact on SEC outcomes through age 2, it did favorably impact markers of hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (HPA)-axis function in children at 12 months of age; and (3) exposure to adversities (acute poverty,
intimate partner violence (IPV), and low maternal social support) appear to be more impactful on child
outcomes than maternal depression during the earliest developmental period, and child sex may influence the
prevalence of certain adversity exposures after birth as well as their impact on child outcomes. The children of
this cohort are about to embark on their first major life transition requiring significant adaptation – that into
formal schooling. Following the children through this transition allows us to test key hypotheses linking the rich
data already collected on multiple adversities beginning in pregnancy, potential psychosocial and biological
mechanisms, and outcomes at this important stage of life course. This study will continue to follow our unique
cohort until the children turn 8. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: (1) evaluate the impact of the
ongoing and extended intervention (now called “THP Preschool” (THP-PS) on child socioemotional and
cognitive (SEC) outcomes at ages 5 through 8, and determine the extent to which the impact is mediated by
maternal depression trajectories; (2) examine how the type and timing of adversity exposures, including
maternal depression, impacts HPA-axis dysregulation in children, and whether HPA-axis indicators mediate
the effect of adversity exposures on child SEC indicators. As part of this aim we will also examine the impact of
the ongoing intervention on child HPA-axis biomarkers; and (3) explore, through quantitative and qualitative
inquiry, emerging child sex differences in exposure to adversities and their effects on child outcomes."

 In biology, there are two fundamental conflicts: the conflicts between organisms and the conflicts
between organisms and viruses. During the conflicts, a variety of offensive and defensive weaponry are
employed by organisms and viruses. While the molecular mechanisms of the conflicts between organisms
and viruses have been extensively studied, significantly less have been carried out with the conflicts
between organisms. During the conflicts between organisms, protein toxins are frequently employed as the
offensive weapons. Among them, ribotoxins constitutes one of the biggest groups. In fact, colicin E3 was
the first ribotoxin to be characterized 50 years ago. It makes a single but precise cut of 16S rRNA in the
decoding center of bacterial ribosome, resulting in stalled ribosome and eventual cell death. Over the last
half of a century, it is unclear whether there exists a biological system that is able to reverse the ribosomal
damage by colicin E3 to allow cell to survive. Employing approaches of bioinformatics, biochemistry,
structural biology, and microbiology, we have uncovered a bacterial two-component system, RtcB and PrfH,
as the antidote of colicin E3. Specifically, bacterial PrfH recognizes the damaged and stalled ribosome and
performs ribosomal rescue. This is followed by RtcB repairing the damaged 30S ribosomal subunit. The
sequential events described above are supported by abundant preliminary data from both our in vitro and in
vivo studies. In this application, we plan to significantly expand our preliminary studies to systematically
characterize the rescue and repair of bacterial ribosome with specific damage in the decoding center with
the following three main aims: 1) We will provide insight into bacterial PrfH recognizing and rescuing the
damaged and stalled 70S ribosome in vitro; 2) We will biochemically and structurally characterize bacterial
RtcB in vitro, with the emphasis of PrfH-coupled RtcB repairing the damaged 30S ribosomal subunit; and 3)
We will elucidate in vivo biological functions of RtcB-PrfH using an in vivo attenuated RNA damage system
we have developed."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Native Americans (NAs). The Lumbee tribal
community in Robeson county in North Carolina suffer from severe disparities related to cardiovascular
disease incidence and mortality. Hypertension (HTN) strongly elevates the morbidity and mortality risks related
to cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle modifications promoted by U.S. HTN guidelines includes modifiable self-
care behaviors such as regular physical activity which is associated with lower blood pressure, reduced
cardiovascular risk, and beneficial cardiac structural remodeling. Therefore, motivating physical activity
behaviors would be key to cardiovascular health promotion efforts among the NA Lumbee tribal community.
One promising approach is the use of sensor-controlled digital games (SCDGs), which offer affordable,
portable, and scalable tools to facilitate engagement in HTN self-care behaviors while being enjoyable and
easy to use. The SCDG intervention integrates HTN participants’ behavioral data from an activity tracker
sensor to activate game progress, rewards, and feedback. The primary goal of this study is to test a culturally
adapted SCDG intervention (N-SCDG) for improving daily physical activity self-care behaviors among Lumbee
tribal adults with HTN and examine approaches for sustaining the impact of the N-SCDG at the community
level. For Aim 1, we will use community based participatory approach to culturally adapt a SCDG intervention
that we have already developed for mobile smartphones to motivate sustained physical activity self-care
behaviors among NA adults with HTN. For Aim 2, using a randomized controlled clinical trial, we will compare
the N-SCDG intervention versus a sensor-only control for the primary outcome of engagement in the HTN self-
care behavior of physical activity and the secondary outcomes of HTN self-care knowledge, self-care
behaviors, self-efficacy, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac hospitalization, and quality of life at
baseline and at 3 and 6 months. For our sample, we will recruit adults aged 18 years or older from tribal
affiliated cardiac clinics in Robeson county. We will randomize 220 participants to either the N-SCDG
intervention group, in which participants will receive sensors that track physical activity and will play the N-
SCDG on a mobile smartphone, or a control group that will receive sensors, an app that tracks physical
activity, and standardized written HTN educational materials. For Aim 3, we will evaluate the sustainability of
N-SCDG intervention in the Lumbee tribal community through qualitative interviews with study participants and
community leaders and train Lumbee community members to sustain and disseminate the N-SCDG
intervention for building community capacity for HTN management. This project will generate insight and
guidance for scalable and easy-to-use digital gaming solutions to motivate HTN self-care behaviors and
improve health outcomes among NA individuals with HTN."

The evolutionarily conserved Wnt pathway plays a critical role during metazoan development
and stem cell maintenance in the adult. Mutations in the Wnt pathway leading to its
misregulation in humans have been shown to contributes to both developmental defects and
cancers. In the latter case, over 90% of all non-hereditary forms of colorectal cancers are
initiated by mutations in the Wnt pathway leading to its inappropriate activation. There are no
FDA-approved drugs that inhibit the Wnt pathway, which is likely due to our incomplete
understanding of the mechanism of Wnt signaling and the lack of suitable drug targets. The
primary focus of my lab is to understand the biological function of the Wnt signaling pathway by
deciphering its molecular mechanism and identifying new Wnt components. Our ultimate goal is
to use this information to understand how deregulation of the Wnt pathway can lead to Wnt-
driven diseases in humans.
Over more than a decade, my lab has made significant contributions to our fundamental
understanding of Wnt signaling. These breakthroughs were accomplished via the development
of the first biochemical system (using Xenopus egg extract), the reconstitution of active purified
proteins, the development of the first mathematical model (Lee-Heinrich model), and the
identification of small molecule inhibitors (CK1 agonists), one of which has been designated by
the FDA as an orphan drug for a familial precancerous disease (familial adenomatous
polyposis).
Our current work focused on determining the role of the USP46/UAF1/WDR20 deubiquitinase
complex in regulating LRP6 receptor turnover, the mechanism by which APC regulates Wnt
receptor activity, the role of the -catenin degradation complex in mediating bistable pathway
behavior, and the roles of USP47 and STK38, in regulating Wnt signaling. In our renewal
application, we now propose to 1) reconstitute LRP6 ubiquitylation and identify its evolutionarily
conserved E3 ligase, 2) understand the basis for signal compensation upon Wnt receptor loss in
APC mutant cells, 3) provide evidence for the role of bistability in generating morphogenetic
signaling, and 4) uncover the roles of the STK38 and TRIP12 in nuclear Wnt signaling."
10843521,"Overall Project Summary
Northwestern University (NU) is renowned for its interdisciplinary cutaneous biology research program, which
focuses on epidermal structure and function. The NU Skin Biology and Disease Resource Center (SBDRC)
adopts the theme ""Keratinocyte and its Microenvironment"" to promote exceptional basic and translational
research. With 41 Senior Bench members, 8 Junior Bench members, 1 new non-member P&F Awardee, and
13 Collaborating Clinical Associate members, the SBDRC spans 13 University departments and 5 divisions
within the Department of Medicine. The ultimate goal of the SBDRC is to provide the infrastructure for
discovery that can translate into improved patient care. The SBDRC consists of four cores: Administrative
(Admin), Skin Tissue Engineering and Morphology (STEM), Translating Experimental Skin Testing with
Immune Tracing, Informatics and Technology (TEST IT2 ), and Gene Editing, Transduction, and
Nanotechnology (GET iN). The Admin Core fosters collaboration through its Enrichment Program, Pilot and
Feasibility (P&F) Grants, and the Minority and Sex Awareness (MSA) Program. The STEM Core offers diverse
primary healthy and diseased human skin cells and tissue, but also simple and complex multi-cell 3D human
skin equivalent models using cells from healthy or diseased skin. Cells for models can be modified genetically,
including with inducible gene manipulation, and viewed using innovative tools, such as live imaging. The Core
also offers a range of morphogenetic processing services. Our next generation TEST IT2 Core provides state-
of-the-art single-cell and spatial genomic tools with a focus on interactions between keratinocytes and other
cell types, such as immune cells, fibroblasts, melanocytes, and nerve afferents. The Core offers immunological
assays and the unique opportunity for controlled human testing. Skin-specific bioinformatics pipelines and
resources for investigator-initiated projects are available. The GET iN Core generates a broad range of viral
constructs and provides nonviral delivery techniques using nanotechnology, such as spherical nucleic acids
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like nanoparticles, as well as electroporation. The Core offers
CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout, a genome-wide CRISPR screen, and epigenomic approaches (CRISPRa and
CRISPRi). The STEM, TEST IT2 , and GET iN Cores collaborate internally and with other University Cores to
provide education, technical services, and interpretation of results. The NU SBDRC is well-positioned to offer
users the opportunity to translate their basic findings into animal and human cell models, as well as the clinical
setting, empowering skin biologists at NU and beyond to significantly advance our understanding and
treatment of skin disease."
10843522,"Administrative Core Project Summary
The Administrative Core, led by the Center Director, Dr. Amy S. Paller, and two Associate Center Directors,
Drs. Rui Yi and Kurt Lu, will be responsible for coordinating all activities of the SBDRC. The Administrative
Core will serve as a focal point for all cutaneous biology-related activities for scientists at Northwestern and
nationally via an Enrichment Program that organizes seminars, workshops, lectures, and one-on-one
interactions with distinguished visiting scientists. The Core will serve as a liaison with other Centers, including
running joint conferences with skin-focused groups regionally (eg, the CounterACT Center and Chan
Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago) and nationally (other SBDRCs). The Administrative Core will also maintain the
SBDRC website and disseminate electronic communication, including through a newsletter and use of social
media. The Core will continue to encourage investigators to enter the skin biology field and utilize Research
Core services through the administration of a Pilot & Feasibility Program that funds three P&F grants per year.
Through management of the Minority and Sex Awareness Program, the Administrative Core hopes to: (i)
promote a better understanding of the biology of all human skin; and (ii) attract and recruit under-represented
minorities and women into cutaneous research. To this end, we ensure diversity in the Cores’ cell and skin
biorepository, prioritize pilot grants that involve comparison between sexes or racial/ethnic groups or a problem
that disproportionately affects one sex or a minority population, and have numerous programs that encourage
high school through medical school students from underrepresented minorities to consider skin biology
research as a career. The Administrative Core will regularly review the other Research Cores (Skin Tissue
Engineering and Morphology/STEM, Translating Experimental Skin Testing with Immune Tracing, Informatics,
and Technology/TEST IT2, and Gene Editing, Transduction and Nanotechnology/GET iN) to assure quality,
fiscal responsibility, cutting-edge science, and continued development of new services. The Core will also
oversee all fiscal maintenance of Center resources, including service cost calculations and ensuring an overall
balanced budget. The Administrative Core will accomplish all of these tasks with guidance from: (i) the SBDRC
Executive Committee; (ii) the Executive Board (administrative oversight); (iii) an Internal Advisory Board
(science oversight); and (iv) an External Advisory Board. Finally, the Core will continue to foster the training of
young scientists in the field of skin biology and skin diseases through the continued mentorship of our junior
members by more senior SBDRC bench research members and the Boards."
10843523,"STEM Core Project Summary
The Skin Tissue Engineering and Morphology (STEM) Core of the Northwestern University Skin Biology and
Diseases Resource-based Center (NU-SBDRC) is committed to providing access and expertise to human skin
tissue and primary skin cells, 3D skin models, and histological services to accomplish our long-term goal of
stimulating new skin biology research and to propel ongoing discoveries towards translation. To achieve our goal
of driving cutaneous research, we will accomplish four specific aims. Our first aim is to expand our biobank
through deposit of primary human skin cells, archival tissues, and skin-related databases in partnership with the
TEST IT2 Core. We are particularly focused on diversifying our biobank with respect to self-identified race or
ethnicity, sex, age, and disease state. Our second aim is to provide services for establishing and evaluating
human and mouse skin culture models. 3D skin culture models are powerful tools for understanding physiologic
and disease states of skin as these models recapitulate skin morphogenesis and differentiation. The STEM Core
provides services, materials and reagents to investigators who want to use these models in their research
program. Moreover, our service pipeline encompasses histological techniques, instruments, and tools to analyze
3D skin culture models to assess their morphology, extent of differentiation, barrier function, and mechanical
integrity. A major focus of the STEM Core is to encourage and facilitate new basic and translational cutaneous
research. To achieve this goal, our third aim, we will partner with multidisciplinary investigators to establish
innovative engineered skin culture models for drug discovery and device development. We will generate more
complex skin models with a variety of cell types, especially immune cells to generate models of inflammatory
disease. We will partner with the GET iN Core to develop inducible promoter systems to tune the spatiotemporal
expression or knockdown of proteins relevant to skin biology. We will also continue to pioneer methods to probe
mechanical properties and advance imaging capabilities for skin and 3D skin models. Finally, our fourth aim is
to engage our communities in training, education, and mentorship centered on skin and skin research.
Paramount to achieving this, we provide in-depth training and continued support in primary skin cell isolation and
3D skin model establishment to all interested investigators. Our protocols are freely shared as we want the
application of 3D skin models to become an accessible tool for investigators to use in their own laboratories.
Altogether, the objective of the STEM Core is to accelerate investigative dermatology by providing resources,
tools, expertise, and training to advance our understanding of skin and skin diseases to ultimately impact patient
care."
10841191,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mission of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR)
Predoctoral Clinical Research Training Program (T32) is to provide an integrated set of training opportunities
focused on the core principles of translational science. We will build on our success of training more than 150
predoctoral students to date by focusing the training experience on (1) specific skills for competency in research
(2) individual mentored project development and (3) community engagement. A core program goal is to advance
diversity among researchers in translational science. We have a track record of training scholars who are
underrepresented in medicine at a rate higher than the national average. We will continue to advance this goal,
including for trainees from disadvantaged backgrounds or with disabilities. Our history of successful recruitment
and selection of a diverse group of trainees from participating institutions allows us to build on our efforts to enroll
a wider range of trainees in diverse disciplines. We will use existing strategies to recruit trainees in medicine,
nursing, dentistry, and public health with diverse scientific interests and perspectives in translational science.
Our partnerships with MSU, a Historically Black University (HBU), and UMB will provide additional access to
diverse perspectives to help address health disparities. We (1) Teach core principles in clinical and translational
research, ensuring trainees have the knowledge and skills to succeed in their scientific pursuits and build an
identity as translational researchers; (2) Provide a supportive and collaborative culture for trainees; (3) Create a
community of clinical and translational science trainees, building networks and collaborations among trainees
(and mentors), driving innovation; and (4) Encourage the development of team science skills. Trainees will
recognize the importance of working collaboratively, an increasingly critical research skill. Our integrated
program offers a multidisciplinary mentoring team, didactic training, competency-based interactive workshops,
core ICTR resources, peer-support and resource-sharing designed to stimulate lifelong engagement in a clinical
and translational research career. The program offers trainees intensive and hand-on learning experiences that
prepare them to be exemplary clinical and translational scientists in any discipline, specialty or subspecialty. Our
heterogeneous pool of trainees will emerge equipped with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to advance
diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve health and reduce
health disparities as they develop into independent researchers. We will perform continuous program evaluation
with multiple metrics. We evaluate the program itself (faculty, courses, seminars) and track enrollment, retention,
and diversity of trainees; and conduct course and mentoring evaluations. Like the consortium of CTSA academic
medical institutions across the country, we will report on trainee performance and satisfaction, and mentor
satisfaction. We will also measure, evaluate, and disseminate the impact of translational research from our
program. The JHU ICTR T32 will support 10 predoctoral trainees per year for a minimum of 12 months."
10844451,"Abstract
This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics
(e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural
language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing
granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is
defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial
expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision
and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder
in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in
MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived
spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill,
and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together,
these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction
in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and
multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse
sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal
features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy.
These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular
metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision
level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are
promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social
communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification
models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic
dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated
multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved
individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine
approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc-
cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of
applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical
trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD."
10844553,"Signaling Mechanisms of Opioid-induced Hyperalgesia and Tolerance
Project Summary
The major objective of this project is to identify key signaling mechanisms responsible for the development of
opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance (OHT). Opioid drugs remain indispensable for treating
severe pain caused by surgery, trauma, and cancer. However, acute and repeated administration of μ-opioid
receptor (MOR) agonists often cause OHT, the major obstacle to adequate pain relief with opioids. OHT can
also lead to unsafe opioid dose escalation, resulting in dependence, addiction, and even overdose death. Opioid
signaling is complex and has been studied mostly in vitro, but the functional significance and relevance of various
opioid signaling components to OHT are poorly understood. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are a
clinically validated target for treating OHT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is stimulated by MOR
activation and is involved in opioid-induced NMDAR hyperactivity at the spinal cord level and in OHT. At present,
little is known about the upstream signaling mechanism leading to stimulation of ERK at the spinal cord level
during OHT. Although BRAF, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, is a crucial upstream signal for ERK
activation, its role in OHT has not been recognized previously. In our preliminary studies, we found that repeated
treatment with opioids increased BRAF activity in the spinal cord. Furthermore, BRAF inhibition or knockdown
at the spinal cord level substantially attenuated OHT and rescued the synaptic trafficking and expression of
MORs and NMDARs in the spinal cord altered by opioid treatment. These initial findings suggest that BRAF-
dependent signaling plays a key role in the control of synaptic MOR and NMDAR plasticity in the development
of OHT. Therefore, in this competing renewal application, we will test the overall hypothesis that repeated
treatment with opioids, through the BRAF-mediated signaling axis, induces (1) analgesic tolerance by inhibiting
expression and activity of MORs at primary afferent central terminals and (2) hyperalgesia by promoting
trafficking and activity of NMDARs at primary afferent terminals synapsing with spinal cord excitatory neurons.
To test this hypothesis, we will use a multidisciplinary approach, including protein biochemistry,
electrophysiological recordings in spinal cord slices, and targeted gene knockout and knockin. Our proposed
studies are expected to advance our understanding of the fundamental signaling mechanisms highly relevant to
the development of OHT. Our project also has important clinical implications and could lead to new strategies
(e.g., using FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors) for improving opioid analgesic efficacy in patients with severe pain."
10844554,"The University of Washington School of Nursing (UW SoN) has a rich history in building nursing science capacity.
Over the past 4 years, The UW SoN T32 Omics and Symptom Science Training Program was highly successful
in preparing a diverse cadre of nurse scientists for research careers through our focused training program that
emphasized omics and precision health. During this time-period, 6 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees
completed training. In 2021, the Future of Nursing Report and the NINR Strategic Plan identified the need to
develop the next generation of nursing scientists poised to play scientific and leadership roles in new initiatives
that incorporate omics measures as well as multilevel modeling, data science and big data approaches to
address medical and social determinants of health (SDOH). Given nursing's tradition of utilizing biobehavioral
information in concert with patient, family, community and population assessments, developing nurse scientists
with complementary skills in the interpretation and translation of “upstream” omics and SDOH is imperative. In
this renewal, we provide rigorous interdisciplinary research training to incorporate and evaluate omics in health
and disease of individuals, and add an emphasis on families, communities and populations to build nursing
science aimed at promoting health across the spectrum from biology to society (B2S). We will continue to provide
training in omics methodology while expanding our emphasis on multilevel and societal implications. To
accomplish this, a concerted effort is used to train nursing science doctoral students and postdoctoral trainees
in skills related to team science, data science, and multilevel approaches to issues of human health. These
experiences will include hands-on research experiences with research mentors. B2S training faculty are
interdisciplinary and have active research programs related to biologic/omics measures, socioecological models
and indicators of health, data science and team science. The specific aims for the B2S training program are to:
1) recruit and retain a qualified diverse cadre of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to conduct nursing
research that integrates multilevel approaches to issues of human health (biology to society); 2) provide
interdisciplinary didactic research training in contemporary theories, methods, and skills necessary to conduct
research from individual to system levels including the design, implementation, and evaluation of multilevel and
omics-based research approaches; 3) promote the ability of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to develop
research expertise in multilevel analysis from the individual to the system level through the integration of
interdisciplinary mentoring, immersion in ongoing B2S research activities, scholarly dialogue and presentation
as well as structured feedback and critique; 4) mentor trainees in the ethical conduct of research, especially in
diverse and vulnerable populations, and recognize the complex ethical implications in integrating omics methods
in research; 5) evaluate the B2S training program structures, processes, and outcomes on an ongoing and
annual basis. Our goal is to train 3 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees annually over 5 years."
10844556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 I am applying for this NRSA postdoctoral fellowship with the long-term career goal of becoming an
independent investigator capable of leading a highly productive research lab in the field of neuroscience. Under
the guidance of Dr. Ethan Goldberg and Dr. Doug Coulter, this mentored fellowship will provide me the
conceptual and hands-on training required to achieve my goal and thrive in the scientific enterprise.
 Pathogenic variants in the gene KCNC1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit
Kv3.1, lead to severe neurological disease including epilepsy. While most patient-derived variants are loss-of-
function, the precise mechanisms by which impaired Kv3.1 function alters individual neuron physiology and
neural circuit function to result in spontaneous seizures are unclear. Kv3.1 is prominently expressed in
parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons (PV-IN) in various subcellular regions including the
dendrites, soma, axon, and synaptic terminal where it critically contributes to reliable high-frequency action
potential generation and propagation. Because PV-INs critically contribute to network dynamics and constrain
excitability of nearby excitatory pyramidal neurons in cortical circuits, we hypothesize that Kv3.1 dysfunction
impairs PV-IN high-frequency action potential generation and propagation, disinhibits pyramidal neurons, and
contributes to aberrant network excitability to drive abnormal behavior and seizures. Therefore, the overarching
objective of this study is to determine the effect of mutant Kv3.1 on PV-IN physiology as a potential major
contributor to pathogenesis of KCNC1-related epilepsy. In aim 1, I will collect patch-clamp electrophysiology
recordings of somatic and axonal potassium channel function and neuronal excitability in PV-INs from a novel
mouse model of KCNC1 epilepsy which harbors the epileptic encephalopathy patient-derived p.A421V variant.
Given the substantially reduced channel activity observed in the p.A421V variant, and that Kv3 currents are
necessary for fast-spiking physiology, I anticipate that PV-INs from the mouse model of KCNC1 epileptic
encephalopathy will exhibit impaired action potential generation at the soma, and unreliable propagation through
the axon. In aim 2, I will interrogate deficits in inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to mutant Kv3.1
expression using multiple (6-8) simultaneous recordings of synaptically-connected PV-INs and pyramidal
neurons in cortical microcircuits. Lastly, in aim 3 I will corroborate my in vitro findings in the in vivo context
through calcium-imaging of neuronal activity in awake, behaving mice. To relate neuronal activity to relevant
behavior, I will examine the excitability of both cortical pyramidal neurons and PV-INs in response to sensory
stimulation by whisker deflection and test the hypothesis that altered Kv3.1 function in PV-INs compromises
network inhibition in vivo. Overall, completion of the aims described in this mentored fellowship will provide
significant insight into the mechanisms of epilepsy in KCNC1-related disorders and deeper understanding of the
contribution of Kv3 channels to PV-IN physiology in general."
10844557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This proposal outlines a 5-year mentored training program to develop
Carl Walther, MD, MS, Assistant Professor of Medicine-Nephrology at Baylor College of Medicine, into an
independent clinical investigator. Dr. Walther is a board-certified nephrologist with a Master of Science in
Clinical Research. His research focuses on the nexus of kidney disease and heart disease, in particular the
high burden of kidney disease in the rapidly growing field of durable mechanical circulatory support (primarily
left ventricular assist devices [LVADs]) for advanced heart failure (HF). This proposal contains an integrated
training and research plan to build Dr. Walther’s strong foundation of knowledge and experience into expertise
in innovative research methods and practice to improve kidney disease in LVAD recipients and others with
advanced heart failure. The career goals are: 1) train in the advanced/modern analytic and statistical
techniques necessary to obtain valid, useful, individualized information from dense, multidimensional data; 2)
develop expertise in physiology and prospective research techniques, including translational biomarker
science, necessary for individualized characterization of kidney and cardiovascular health; 3) experience
leading a prospective, multispecialty, collaborative study in a multimorbid population. The integrated,
collaborative training and research plan includes formal coursework, mentored activities, conferences and
targeted short courses, and will be performed in the outstanding environment of Baylor and the Texas Medical
Center. He will be guided by a team of senior mentors and consultants with broad expertise: advanced analytic
methods (Wolfgang Winkelmayer, MD, MPH, DSc and Jesse Schold, PhD), translational biomarker science
(Steven Coca, DO, MS), prospective kidney research (Sankar Navaneethan MD, MPH, MS), prospective
mechanical circulatory support research (Kenneth Liao, MD, PhD), and functional kidney imaging (Emily
Chang, MD). The specific aims unify to precisely understand and predict adverse kidney outcomes with
durable mechanical circulatory support. Aim 1 will identify novel global phenotypes in advanced heart failure at
high risk for important adverse kidney outcomes, leveraging an existing national database. Aim 2 will
prospectively assess how kidney parenchymal health prior to LVAD implantation (measured non-invasively,
using a panel of kidney biomarkers) is related to important kidney outcomes. Aim 3 will study how kidney
parenchymal health changes during long-term mechanical circulatory support, and the relationship of
longitudinal kidney parenchymal health with neurohormonal activation and inflammation. This research is
innovative in its precise approach to understanding and predicting the effects of durable mechanical circulatory
support on global kidney health, an essential step towards reducing the growing burden of cardiorenal disease."
10844903,"Summary:
In hearts, Endothelial cells (EC), closely surround cardiomyocytes (CM) and this intricate anatomical
arrangement of cardiomyocytes within the capillary network not only allows for physiological transport but also
for local communication between endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes during development and in both
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) inflicts massive injury to the
coronary microcirculation leading to vascular disintegration and capillary rarefication in the infarct region.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the ongoing molecular conversation between EC and CM is highly relevant
to the post-infarct angiogenesis and progression of myocardial injury and repair processes. Similarly, bone-
marrow derived endothelial precursor cells (BM-EPC) have been shown to facilitate post-MI neovascularization.
Following MI, efficient perfusion provided by micro vessels is required to prevent further cardiomyocyte death,
which contributes to infarct expansion, left ventricular dilation, and adverse cardiac remodeling. Few studies
have investigated whether and how communicative signals produced by stressed CM impact local EC and distant
BM-EPC biology and angiogenic functions following myocardial injury. Particularly, whether extracellular vesicles
or exosomes (EV/Exo) secreted from stressed CMs communicate with and modulate EC/EPC biology and
angiogenesis during ischemic injury and the molecular cargo from stressed CM-exosomes that may alter EC
function remains largely unexplored. The scientific premise of proposed studies is based on our exciting
preliminary data that demonstrates that circulating exosomes from plasma of mice shortly after MI are highly
enriched in two cardiomyocyte derived microRNAs (Myo-miR208 and Myo-miR499) and that post-MI circulating
exosomes from stressed CM transfer these myomiRs not only locally to cardiac endothelial cells but also distantly
to BM-EPCs. These CM communicative signals induce EC and EPC dysfunction downstream of these myo-
miRs. Overall, this project will test the central hypothesis that ‘cardiomyocyte exosome-mediated delivery of
MyomiRs 208 and 499 to EC and EPCs negatively alters their biology and inhibits post-MI neovascularization
leading to adverse cardiac remodeling and that inhibition of myomiRs208/499 will improve post-MI angiogenesis
and cardiac functions’. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments organized under following specific
aims: 1) To establish the inhibitory effect of cardiomyocyte exosome-delivered myo-miRs 208a-3p and 499-5p
on post-MI angiogenesis and cardiac functions; 2) To elucidate the downstream targets and molecular
mechanisms of myo-miRs 208a-3p and 499-5p mediated endothelial cell dysfunction; and 3) To determine the
differential therapeutic efficacy of post-MI and non-injured mouse bone marrow derived EPCs and their
exosomes on post-MI cardiac repair. We believe that proposed studies will not only enhance new mechanistic
insights into cardiomyocyte-endothelial cell communication during myocardial injury but may also potentially
identify new therapeutic targets to regulate post-injury vascular repair and cardiac functions."
10844459,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are standard post-treatment care for postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS)
with hormone-receptor positive (HR+) tumors. AIs improve survival and reduce risk for cancer recurrence, but
they also cause significant adverse effects. The most common is arthralgia—joint pain and stiffness that affects
about 50% of BCS beginning soon after starting an AI. Painful arthralgia causes emotional distress and poor
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is also the AI side effect most strongly linked to AI adherence problems,
which are a critical medical concern. Current medical and behavioral interventions for managing painful arthralgia
help only a minority of BCS, cause toxicities that limit their use, or have weak evidence, revealing a critical gap
limiting ability to reduce the impact of painful arthralgia on BCS using AIs. We propose to fill this critical gap with
Pain Coping Skills Training (PCST), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-informed intervention. To our
knowledge, no study has evaluated PCST for management of AI-associated painful arthralgia, although
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that PCST and similar interventions delivered by trained therapists
can improve pain and reduce disability in people with cancer, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and other pain
conditions. Despite efficacy, PCST continues to be underused in clinical care due to barriers such as high
resource costs, lack of availability in some geographic areas, travel requirements for patients, and a shortage of
trained therapists. We developed a web-based PCST program called painTRAINER to overcome these barriers,
using a novel approach to optimize engagement and retain therapeutically critical features of therapist-delivered
PCST in an “automated” program that does not require therapist involvement. PainTRAINER mimics highly
interactive and personalized therapist-delivered PCST. RCT evidence shows that painTRAINER is highly
acceptable and engaging, and that it can reduce joint pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis (OA). We
now seek to evaluate whether it can improve the severity of painful arthralgia and its associated interference and
other adverse impacts on BCS on AI therapy. The proposed multi-site RCT will randomize 452 BCS with AI-
associated painful arthralgia to enhanced usual care (EUC) or painTRAINER+EUC. Assessments will occur at
baseline, post-intervention (12 weeks after baseline), and 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Aims are to
determine whether painTRAINER+EUC, compared to EUC, improves pain severity and pain interference (Aim
1, primary outcomes) as well as distress, HRQoL, and AI adherence (Aim 2, secondary outcomes). We will also
determine whether these effects on primary and secondary outcomes are at least partially mediated by increases
in pain self-efficacy and reductions in pain catastrophizing (Aim 3). Finally, for an exploratory aim we will evaluate
beneficial indirect effects on sleep problems and vasomotor symptoms in addition to gathering participant
feedback on painTRAINER’s fit for their unique needs. This RCT could yield a highly disseminable intervention
that could be quickly implemented clinically, including in geographic areas with limited access to PCST."
10843553,"Project Summary
Our overarching goal is to increase the rates of cervical cancer (CC) screening among Indigenous women in
the U.S. This population experiences disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality.
They are twice as likely to develop and to die from CC compared to non-Hispanic White women. They are
often diagnosed at a later stage, which makes successful treatment and survival more challenging. Early
detection through regular CC screening saves lives and significantly reduces human papillomavirus (HPV)-
related infections, subsequent health risks, and CC mortality by up to 80%. However, approximately 45% of
Indigenous women remain unscreened. To address this issue and improve CC screening rates, we aim to
develop and test the efficacy and feasibility of a theory-driven, culturally-tailored, multilevel, multimedia mobile
web app intervention (called wPap), specifically targeting Indigenous women in the Yankton Sioux Tribe (YST)
Reservation in South Dakota. We will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial using community-based
participatory research and multiple methodologies over a 4-year period. We will recruit 120 YST women aged
25 to 65 years and randomly assign them to either the waitlist control group (n=60, receiving printed
educational materials on CC and screening guidelines), or the wPap intervention group (n=60, receiving
culturally-tailored and personalized multilevel, multimedia messages through a mobile web app). The wPap
interventions will be administered for 7 days. We will conduct assessments at baseline, 1-week post-
intervention, and 6-month follow-up surveys and focus groups. Aim 1 will identify individual, sociocultural, and
structural determinants of CC and CC screening through qualitative assessment. The information gathered will
guide developing the wPap intervention. Aim 2 will develop the multilevel, multimedia wPap intervention to
promote CC screening for Indigenous women. Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the wPap
intervention for increasing CC screening rates among Indigenous women. Evaluation criteria will include the
intervention’s feasibility (i.e., acceptability and satisfaction) and efficacy (i.e., receipt of CC screening, changes
in knowledge and attitudes/beliefs about screening, self-efficacy, and intent to undergo CC screening). By
addressing barriers to screening, the wPap intervention has the potential to increase accessibility and
sustainability of evidence-based preventive care, ultimately reducing health disparities in Indian Country. The
results will have wide applicability, serving as a model for improving cancer-related health outcomes and early
intervention for other types of cancer for Indigenous women across geographical regions and tribal
communities."
10844388,"Project Summary/Abstract
In this project, we will test the overall hypothesis that PIEZO channels mediate mechanosensation in the cardiac
pacemaker and that they are essential players on the heart rate acceleration evoked by mechanical stretch. We
will leverage our expertise in the study of the cardiac pacemaker to enter into two new research fields for our
laboratory: mechanosensation and mechano-electrical coupling. The heart is one of the most mechanically active
organs in the body. Besides being a remarkably effective pump, the heart senses its mechanical environment
and adjusts its performance to match the physiological demands. In a mechanism known as the “Bainbridge
Reflex”, the cardiac pacemaker responds to the stretch induced by the increase in venous return with an
acceleration of its pace to empty the heart effectively. To sense these constant changes in stretch, the
pacemaker is equipped with stretch-activated channels, however, their molecular identity remains elusive.
PIEZO channels mediate mechanotransduction in every cell type where its expression has been detected so far.
Despite being expressed in the pacemaker and being considered the candidate to mediate pacemaker
mechanotransduction, the role of PIEZO channels in this tissue has not been explored yet. This proposal will
directly test the role of PIEZO channels in the stretch-activated response of the cardiac pacemaker.
Our innovative approach includes the development of pacemaker-specific mouse lines to test the effect of PIEZO
knockdown and overexpression in the pacemaker activity at the cellular, tissue, and animal level. We will
combine immunodetection, in-situ hybridization, electrophysiology, high-resolution imaging, calcium imaging,
and telemetry to: (Aim 1) Characterize the abundance, isoform relative expression, cell-expression specificity,
and subcellular localization of Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels in the pacemaker tissue and isolated pacemaker
cells. (Aim 2) Evaluate the role of PIEZO channels in the pacemaker stretch-activated current, the stretch-
activated increase in intrinsic firing rate, the automaticity of pacemaker cells, and in their subthreshold calcium
activity. (Aim 3). Determine the role of PIEZO channels in the stretch-activated electrical and calcium responses
in the intact pacemaker tissue and their role in normal heart function in vivo. Completing the aims listed above
will provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in pacemaker cells and will help
to identify novel targets for detecting and treating associated arrhythmias. Our results will also provide a diverse
toolkit to identify multiple important mechanisms behind the translation of pacemaker stretch into heart rate
acceleration, opening new avenues for our lab to study the downstream signaling pathways that are regulated
by the mechanical activation of PIEZO channels in this tissue."

Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) leaders across the country have called for more effective
ways to train K-12 teachers in pedagogy aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). While
NGSS holds promise as an engaging way for students to build authentic science skills and conceptual
knowledge, implementation is limited by the degree to which teachers can be trained in new, significant
pedagogical shifts. This is especially true for K-5 teachers who have low confidence teaching science and,
accordingly, devote little time to science instruction. This problem is especially acute in urban schools with
insufficient resources to meet NGSS training needs. This threatens NGSS coherence across grade levels. We
must develop effective, efficient NGSS training models if we are to realize our long-term goal of a well-trained,
diverse STEM and healthcare workforce.
Prior NIH-funded research from our group developed a highly effective model of introductory-level NGSS
training for elementary teachers. The current proposal, ESTELE - Elementary Science TEacher LEaders,
builds on this work by accelerating the pace at which elementary teachers can be trained through a new
science teacher leader (STL) program. ESTELE fully integrates STL training with introductory-level training via
am authentic “practicum” training experience in which STLs support novice teachers as they learn and
implement NGSS instructional practices by teaching elementary youth in a summer STEM camp. In this way,
teacher leaders gain important leadership and coaching skills, while novice teachers learn NGSS pedagogy.
STLs then apply their skills during the academic year in their schools, working in support of their peer teachers
to build a broader school culture receptive to NGSS reform. The project’s evaluation plan will assess the
degree to which this dual-training model is effective in training teachers of different entering skill levels, the
effectiveness of STLs providing NGSS training for novice teachers at their schools, and the degree to which
these activities help build a school culture receptive to NGSS instructional practice.
This proposal is responsive to key NIH-SEPA priority areas including (1) Adaptations of successful SEPA
programs in new locations or with new populations, and (2) Embedded math and reading content for projects
targeting P-8 Students. In total ESTELE will train a total of 96 elementary teachers in Chicago Public Schools:
thirty-two science teacher leaders and sixty-four new-to-NGSS teachers. It will also support high-quality
summer learning for 240 underserved youth at Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago, and high-quality academic year
NGSS instruction for up to 7,050 youth in life sciences curricula."

Spread of cancer cells into the spinal fluid, or leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), is an increasingly common
complication of cancer that results in rapid neurologic disability and death. The spinal fluid represents a poor
medium for cell growth: it is hypoxic, with sparse metabolic intermediates, minimal protein, and few growth
factors. Despite this, select cancer cells survive and grow within this space. The mechanisms that underlie cancer
cell growth with the spinal fluid remain poorly understood. The primary objective of the proposed research is to
determine the mechanisms by which breast cancer cells grow within the spinal fluid. Preliminary data from patient
samples and mouse modeling suggest that cancer cells exploit innate immunity to improve their growth in the
spinal fluid. We hypothesize that cancer cell- macrophage interactions alter the cancer cell transcriptome to
enable cancer cells to access limiting substrates for growth such as iron. To address this hypothesis, we propose
to subject iteratively collected spinal fluid samples to multiple orthogonal analyses, including single cell RNA
sequencing, flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. Cellular and molecular components
correlating with development of LM will generate a genes of interest list. This list will be curated through gain-of-
function and loss-of-function studies in syngeneic mouse models of LM. These mouse models together with in
vitro growth assays will enable granular dissection of the molecular mechanisms governing cancer cell growth
within the spinal fluid. This approach will enable us to: 1. Address cellular transcriptional adaptations to the low-
iron environment of the spinal fluid; 2. Determine mechanistic consequences of adaptation to this low iron
microenvironment; and 3. Establish cancer cell-macrophage interactions in leptomeningeal metastasis. This
translational approach will improve understanding of the essential steps that govern cancer cell growth within
the spinal fluid in human disease, identifying key mechanistic steps for rational targeting strategies in the future."

There continues to be great interest and public/health/relevance with regard to understanding the neurobiological 
systems that underlie the comorbidity of substance use disorders and other psychiatric conditions. In a previous 
R01 award, we focused our efforts upon characterizing the neural circuitry underlying moral decision making in 
incarcerated men with varying levels of two frequently co-occurring conditions: stimulant abuse and psychopathy. 
Here we propose to extend this work to incarcerated women, examine longitudinal outcomes, and apply stateof-the-art network analyses for predictive models. Studies published by our research team have demonstrated 
sex differences in the degree and expression of psychopathic traits, patterns of stimulant abuse, and moral 
decision-making. However, the neural circuitry that underlies these sex differences is not well understood. We 
have also identified substantial sex differences in regional gray matter volume and density in our extant samples. 
Collectively, sex differences in pathophysiology could have significant implications for treatment strategies and 
differential biomarkers of treatment prediction and outcome in men and women. We will implement the research 
strategy with a large incarcerated population by deploying a unique mobile MRI scanner to the regional women’s 
prison. Participants will be stratified by their level of lifetime stimulant (cocaine, amphetamine) use severity and 
psychopathic traits (high, medium, low) and will undergo anatomical and functional MRI scanning while 
completing multi-modal (i.e., linguistic and picture) decision-making tasks. We will also examine functional 
network and dynamic network connectivity in women using a new multiband EPI pulse sequence, and collect 
longitudinal outcomes after release to the community and test behavioral and neuropredictive models of relapse 
and future antisocial behavior. This work is expected to generate a large, robust dataset that characterizes the 
overlapping and unique aspects of neural circuitry underlying stimulant use and psychopathy in females. The 
proposed research is in line with recent priorities emphasized by NIDA for projects aimed at examining gender 
differences, and effects specific to females, to improve our understanding of the nature and etiology of drug 
abuse."
10844532,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes an innovative and restorative treatment for shoulder arthrofibrosis, also known as frozen
shoulder. Of the 15 million individuals in the United States suffering from shoulder arthrofibrosis, more than 1.6
million seek medical care each year. Current treatment options, including intraarticular corticosteroid injections,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and nerve blockers, provide only marginal and temporary relief
of patient symptoms and do not address the underlying cause of the disease – the accumulation of fibrotic
collagenous tissue. Physical therapy is a main treatment option but it is prolonged and suboptimal. Surgical
interventions are used in severe cases, but these procedures are fraught with complications and can further
aggravate the fibrosis. We propose the use of human relaxin-2 (RLX) as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of
shoulder arthrofibrosis. RLX is an endogenous 6-kDa peptide hormone that primarily aids in softening of the
pubic symphysis and pelvic ligaments prior to childbirth via extracellular matrix remodeling. Repurposing this
antifibrotic peptide to treat arthrofibrosis represents a first-of-its-kind protein therapy for this disease.
Specifically, we describe detailed mechanism-of-action studies for RLX in the joint space combined with
encapsulation and sustained delivery of RLX from microparticles prepared from both novel and well-established
biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. The proposed experiments will define the molecular and
structural basis for RLX signaling in the joint space and will use an in vivo shoulder joint contracture
immobilization model to test the hypothesis that RLX reduces arthrofibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β1
signaling via the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, thereby decreasing joint stiffness and increasing shoulder
range of motion (ROM). Further, we hypothesize that sustained release of RLX from a single intraarticular
injection of RLX-loaded polymeric microparticles will alleviate both the symptoms and causes of arthrofibrosis.
Importantly, preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous
experimental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise are in place
to address the hypotheses. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are as follows. Aim 1 defines the
molecular mechanism of by which RLX binds its receptor, RXFP1, providing a framework for structure-based
optimization of RLX. Aim 2 determines the material property characteristics of RLX-loaded biodegradable and
biocompatible polymeric microparticles, including RLX release kinetics and particle degradation. Aim 3 assesses
the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the optimal RLX-loaded microparticle formulation identified in Aim 2 using
an established in vivo shoulder contracture model."

The HIV-1 capsid acts as the primary interface between the virus and the cell during viral ingress and nuclear
entry. The capsid is critically involved throughout all steps of the replication cycle, including uncoating,
recognition by host factors, trafficking along microtubules, nuclear import, and genome integration. Recent
research revealed that HIV-1 capsid hijacks microtubule motors dynein and kinesin for its journey towards the
nucleus, and an intact capsid can traverse the cellular nuclear pore complex (NPC). These data significantly
impact our views of HIV-1 cytoplasmic transport, nuclear import, intranuclear transport, and uncoating, and
indicate that capsid is a key player in HIV-1 ingress. However, atomic-level understanding of capsid recognition
by host factors is lacking, and it is unclear how the dynamic exchange of factors occurs during viral movement
from the cell periphery to the site of integration inside the nucleus. The overall goal of this project is to fill these
knowledge gaps by providing critical structural and dynamic information on capsid’s engagement in immune
evasion, trafficking and integration. The proposed studies are an integrated effort from seven PCHPI

elucidate the interactions of HIV-1 capsid with host innate immune proteins, including MxB and
TRIM5α/TRIMCyp; ii) determine the interactions between HIV-1 capsid and intracellular trafficking proteins,
including kinesin-1/FEZ1 and dynein/dynactin/BICD2, and microtubules; and iii) define the dynamics of HIV-1

10835092,"Project 3 – Integration
Retroviral replication requires integration of reverse-transcribed viral DNA into a host cell chromosome. This
process is catalyzed by integrase (IN) in the context of the stable nucleoprotein complex, containing a multimer
of IN assembled on viral DNA ends and termed the intasome. Characterization of in vitro-assembled intasomes
from many retroviral species elucidated conserved as well as genus-specific features. Lentiviral intasomes
harbor large IN homo-oligomers, containing as many as 16 subunits. However, the intasome represents only a
small part of the pre-integration complex (PIC) that assembles and mediates intracellular trafficking of the
intasome during virus infection. Furthermore, it is currently unclear how the HIV-1 PIC interfaces with its target,
chromatinized host cell genomic DNA. This project aims to characterize the structure and properties of the
HIV/lentiviral integration machinery using complementary top-down and bottom-up approaches. From the top-
down, we will leverage several novel affinity reagents to enrich for PICs from cellular extracts and then study
hemi-purified native HIV-1 PICs using advanced DNA footprinting and microscopy techniques. Experiments
using HIV-1 PICs will reveal the function of the IN-binding partner LEDGF/p75 and its cognate epigenetic
modification (H3K36me3) in integration in the context of chromatin. With the bottom-up approach, we will take
advantage of the intasome from maedi-visna virus (MVV, an ovine lentivirus), which, unlike HIV/SIV intasomes,
can be assembled in vitro as monodispersed preparations. This 0.6-MDa complex will allow us to characterize
the dynamics and the structure of the complex between the lentiviral intasome and chromatin at high temporal
and spatial resolutions. The proposed studies will shed light on the architecture of the lentiviral DNA integration
apparatus and how it interfaces with host factors and chromosomes, while avoiding suicidal autointegration.
Given that IN inhibitors are used worldwide to treat people living with HIV-1, our results will provide
unprecedented details of the biological machine that is the target of these highly successful medicines and could
reveal new ways to attack the PIC for therapeutic intervention."

of Hawaiʻi. The AMC designed a successful multi-level mentoring approach for the Research Project Leaders
(RPLs) and Pilot Project Leaders (PPLs) that included: mentors, peer-to peer mentoring, the Advisory Committee
(AC), and Clinical Internal Advisory Board. The overall goal of this core, in alignment with the overall DRC
proposal, is to build a self-sustaining Diabetes Research Center that will improve current and future
research competitiveness and broaden the research breadth and trans-disciplinary scope of diabetes
(DM) and insulin resistance (IR) studies and future diverse scientists in Hawaiʻi. The emphasis of the AMC
is the coordination of all the resources to mentor and facilitate research for the RPLs and PPLs. This will be
accomplished through Specific Aim 1 which is to effectively coordinate and manage a center of excellence
dedicated to DM/IR. The AMC oversight will be conducted by Director, Mariana Gerschenson, PhD and Deputy
Director, Dr. Marjorie Mau, MD. The Executive Committee also includes the Metabolic and Analytic Core Director
and Co-Director: Olivier Le Saux, PhD and Alexandra Binder, ScD and the Pilot Project Program Co-Directors:
Takashi Matsui, MD, PhD, and V. Andrew Stenger, PhD. The team and RPLs obtain advice from the AC. The
Clinical Internal Advisory Board (CIAB) provides the RPLs with clinical scientific advice on diabetes regarding
the approach and analysis of their projects. Community Engagement will be led by Dr. Mau and will consist of a
2-day conference that will prominently feature our DRC investigators as well as community-recommended topics
such as diabetes management updates and the latest prevention strategies. In addition to an annual DM-focused
conference, the DRC leadership will initiate a more active presence on our website and social media platforms.
In Specific Aim 2, the Administrative and Mentoring Core will help each RPL develop an individual mentoring

Diabetic Cardiomyopathy and Protection by Hypothalamic Parasympathetic Neuron Activation
Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a serious complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is strongly
associated with approximately five-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. CAN manifests as a decline in
parasympathetic tone and overactivation of sympathetic activity than contributes to resting tachycardia and fixed
heart rate, to development of myocardial infarction. Although it is a common complication, very little is known
regarding how CAN directly increases the risk for myocardial injury and disease, and thus there are no current
unified treatment algorithms other than life style changes, glycemic control and management of cardiovascular
risk factors. We have recently identified a novel mechanism for restoring cardio-protective parasympathetic tone
to the heart to reduce myocardial damage in diseases with similar autonomic dysfunction, such as heart failure,
myocardial infarct and sleep apnea. Brainstem parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) receive powerful
excitation from a population of oxytocin (OXT) neurons that originate in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (PVN). These unique neurons co-release OXT and enhance excitatory glutamatergic
neurotransmission to CVNs. Based upon our novel results in diseases with similar autonomic imbalances, our
overall hypothesis is that PVN OXT neuron activation will restore diminished parasympathetic activity and
reverse the deleterious hypothalamic, brainstem and cardiac alterations that occur in an animal model of T2DM.
This overarching hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how T2DM alters cardiac
function and autonomic tone, and determine if activation of PVN OXT neurons reverses these deleterious effects.
In-vivo studies using telemetry instrumented rats will test the hypothesis that T2DM reduces cardiac function
(quantified by echocardiography) and exercise tolerance, increases incidence of arrhythmia, and reduces heart
rate recovery, and that PVN OXT stimulation will reverse these deleterious effects. Additional assessments of
myocardial atherosclerosis, inflammation and fibrosis will probe potential mechanisms of loss-of-function and
arrhythmogenesis. Insulin resistance, glucose tolerance and food intake will be assessed in parallel and
correlated with disease progression and therapeutic regression. Aim 2 will characterize regulome underpinnings
of T2DM mediated CAN by identifying the molecular phenotype of autonomic imbalance. We will test the
hypothesis that T2DM alters gene expression of key pathways involved in maintaining mitochondrial metabolism,
antioxidant defense, nitric oxide signaling, and neurotrophic growth in both PVN OXT neurons and CVNs, which
can be reversed by PVN OXT activation. This will be accomplished using 10x Genomics Spatial Transcriptomics
combined with retrograde tracers to identify CVNs originating in specific nuclei of the brainstem. In addition,
snRNA-seq of cardiac left-ventricular tissue will identify how T2DM-reduced preganglionic signals affect
downstream cardiac functional and molecular networks of the heart that are essential mediators of
electromechanical dysfunction."

 2 Rabies is one of the most devastating diseases, with near 100% case fatality once clinical signs occur.
 3 The vast majority of the tens of thousands of human deaths from rabies every year occur in low- to
 4 middle-income countries (LMICs) of Africa and Asia, transmitted through a bite from a rabid dog.
 5 Unlike many neglected tropical diseases, rabies is entirely preventable through timely provision of
 6 post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and elimination through mass vaccination of the dog population has
 7 been demonstrated to be both achievable and cost-effective. Nevertheless, children and those at
 8 the socioeconomic and geographic margins of society are more likely to die of rabies due to
 9 inequities in access to public health services and education, often dying in horrific circumstances
10 without any palliative care. Poor data quality, stemming from limited field-level collection, has been
11 implicated as the singularly most important barrier to rabies control, clouding evidence-based
12 policies and hampering successful control measures. Smartphone and online technologies have
13 revolutionized connectivity between program managers and their remote workforce, enabling field-
14 side digital capture and transmission of programmatic data and spatial communication through
15 interactive maps. The resulting high-resolution data on host population distribution and spatio-
16 temporal rabies case incidence provides new opportunities to optimize control strategies for efficacy
17 and cost-efficiency. This project builds on a long-established program of rabies control interventions
18 across Latin America, Asia and Africa and a versatile platform of technologies developed to support
19 mass dog vaccination and surveillance activities. Further technology development will focus on
20 facilitating widespread democratization of systems, integration with national and international
21 platforms and approaches to support data-driven planning and refinement of rabies control
22 campaigns. Automation of processes for mapping, post-vaccination evaluation and reporting will
23 serve to align strategies and protocols with evidence-based international best-practices for
24 campaign implementation and stimulate engagement with stakeholders at all levels. The impact of
25 novel approaches to the geographic prioritization of vaccination resource on campaign efficiency
26 and rabies transmission will be evaluated. Automated in-app guidance for vaccination team
27 direction, PEP regimen scheduling and the investigation of suspect rabid dogs will be evaluated as
28 compared to non-technology aided approaches. Outcomes of the project will unlock in-country
29 capacity for the implementation of effective One Health rabies control interventions and accelerate
30 progress towards the 2030 global goal for dog-transmitted human rabies elimination."

Specifically, the program will provide
1) a rigorous summer research experience embedded in a dedicated research team under the guidance of
 an experienced faculty mentor;
2) additional research-related didactic training, education, and discussion;
3) a formal opportunity for all students to present their research during Medical Student Research Day and
 network with faculty and students to foster their continued interest in research.
Rationale. Medical student education continues to evolve, with increasing emphasis on training for evidence-
based decision making in clinical settings, which is addressed in our training program, embedded in the
context of the WFSM academic learning health system. For that, we seek support for stipends and training-
related expenses for 15 medical students per year. Accepted students join the summer program after the first
year of medical school and work with their matched faculty for 9 weeks to conduct high-quality, mentored
projects in a multidisciplinary setting as part of a research team, with potential to stay involved in research after
the summer program concludes. This successful, longstanding program with 4 decades of NIH support is
overseen by Program Director D. McClain, MD, PhD, an accomplished clinician-scientist with long history of
NIDDK-relevant funding and extensive training program leadership experience, and supported by two
Associate Directors, an experienced Executive Committee, with administrative management provided by the
Wake Forest Clinical and Translational Science Institute. 25 outstanding faculty mentors with significant NIH
funding will provide student research training, complemented by dedicated, program-specific didactic elements
to develop research-relevant competencies, including sessions on responsible conduct of research, ethics in
research, enhancing rigor and reproducibility, study design, hypothesis testing, understanding and addressing
health disparities, and developing verbal and written research presentation skills. The training program
culminates with a capstone event, Medical Student Research Day, where students network and showcase their
findings through poster and oral presentations. Formal program evaluation includes student self-assessment of
research competencies (pre-and post-MSRP) and formative program assessments by students and mentors.
Through this research engagement early in clinical training, students develop enhanced analytical and critical
thinking skills, and a deeper appreciation for research and its role in evidence-based medicine."
10849696,"ABSTRACT
Enterococci are one of the most recalcitrant hospital-associated pathogens due to resistance to many
antibiotics used in clinical practice with some untreatable infections occurring in immunocompromised
individuals. The CDC conservatively estimates that vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are associated
with 20,000 infections and 1,300 deaths per year in the US alone. VRE typically affect patients who have
multiple comorbidities or with important compromise of the immune system, including solid organ transplant
patients and those with hematological malignancies, among others. Surprisingly, despite the frequent
occurrence of VRE in these vulnerable populations, prospective studies assessing the actual clinical impact of
infections due to these organisms are scarce, limiting the availability of clinical information to guide treatment
for these recalcitrant infections. Furthermore, the paucity of reliable antimicrobial options to treat severe
disease is of major concern. Indeed, enterococci have developed resistance to virtually all anti-enterococcal
antibiotics available in clinical practice. Currently, the lipopetide antibiotic daptomycin (DAP) has become the
first-line therapy due to its bactericidal activity and safety profile, despite lacking FDA approval for this
indication. However, uncertainties on the performance of MIC testing, DAP breakpoint and appropriate dosing
for enterococci are major limitations for using this antibiotic against VRE. Additionally, resistance and tolerance
to DAP readily emerge during therapy via chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the LiaFSR system, a
three component regulatory system that controls the enterococcal cell membrane stress response. In order to
fill this major vacuum in knowledge and optimize the management of enterococcal bacteremia, we have
assembled the VENOUS cohort (Vancomycin-Resistant ENterococci OUtcomes Study), a unique prospective
cohort of patients with enterococcal bacteremia currently recruiting in 17 hospitals in the USA (7 cities) and
additional 4 hospitals in South America (n=2) and Europe (n=2). Our overarching hypothesis is that a deep
understanding of the clinical and microbiological aspects of VRE bloodstream infections and dynamics of the
population structure of infecting isolates is crucial to help design novel diagnostic approaches and treatment
regimens to improve the outcomes of these difficult-to-treat infections. Using the VENOUS study we propose to
i) characterize the clinical impact of VRE bacteremia, ii) dissect the population structure of VRE causing
bloodstream infections and, iii) develop a new minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)-independent diagnostic
test to assess DAP susceptibility, seeking to guide clinicians with a novel tool to allow accurate identification of
DAP-susceptible isolates and improve the use of DAP and combination with β-lactams against these
organisms. The results of this proposal are likely to provide much needed and robust data to optimize the
treatment of VRE infections, deliver the necessary information to plan future interventional studies and develop
innovative diagnostic approaches to revolutionize the management of these life-threatening infections."

The Joint Graduate Program in Toxicology (JGPT) is an interdepartmental training program in mechanistic
toxicology at Rutgers University. Founded in 1981, the JGPT has trained more than 200 doctoral students,
postdoctoral fellows, and clinician scientists. Graduates of the JGPT have established distinguished careers in
academia, industry, and government. The NIEHS T32 training grant is the driving force of the JGPT. This
competitive renewal application requests funding for years 36-40 to support 8 predoctoral students and 3
postdoctoral fellows each year. The central mission of the JGPT is to provide talented and motivated
predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with rigorous didactic and laboratory training in contemporary
mechanistic toxicology and in-depth expertise in their individual field of research. The program is highly
interdisciplinary with students performing research rotations under scientists from varied scientific
backgrounds. Training is supported by an exceptional research environment centered at the Environmental
and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) that includes state-of-the-art instrumentation and
collaboration that synergizes with our NIEHS P30 Center of Excellence in Environmental Health Sciences.
Rutgers University has designated “Environmental Health Sciences” a Signature Program. This affords our
program strong institutional support with significant investment in research, training, and new faculty
recruitment. JGPT trainees benefit from an outstanding seminar series and strong participation by leading
scientists from the local pharmaceutical, chemical and personal care products industry. Intensive efforts are
expended to attract students and fellows of exceptional quality with prior research experience from diverse
scientific disciplines. The JGPT vigorously recruits and retains students from underrepresented groups using
multiple outreach initiatives. Trainee accomplishments include high research productivity, strong publication
and fellowship records, job placement, and honors and awards from professional organizations. The JGPT
adapts to advances in the field of toxicology using comprehensive outcomes assessment and plans are for the
program to undergo an external review by an education evaluator during the next funding cycle.
RELEVANCE: The unifying goal of the JGPT and this training grant is to prepare trainees to excel in the
competitive and rapidly evolving arena of environmental health sciences. Toxicology is a core discipline in
understanding the impact of chemicals on human health. For the last 35 years, this training grant has enabled
Rutgers to educate scholars who have become leaders in academic, industrial, and governmental toxicology."
10849759,"Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is marbled within skeletal muscle and appears to play a key role in the
age-induced risk of type 2 diabetes and sarcopenia. What is not known is how IMAT promotes decreased
muscle insulin sensitivity and sarcopenia. There is a critical need to address this gap in knowledge to
understand how IMAT contributes to the risk of aging-induced sarcopenia and diabetes to inform
intervention strategies. The overall objective for this project is to determine the impact of aging and
exercise training on IMAT secretion of fibronectin and myostatin and the cellular composition of IMAT. Our
central hypothesis is that IMAT secretion of fibronectin promotes muscle insulin resistance, and IMAT
secretion of myostatin promotes sarcopenia, both of which are intensified by aging and diminished by
exercise. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that clarifying the extent to which aging and
exercise training alter the IMAT secretome and cell composition will inform development of interventions to
modify IMAT and improve muscle mass, strength, and insulin sensitivity in older individuals. We propose
two specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine the impact of age and exercise training on IMAT secretion of
fibronectin, IMAT fibroblast composition, and the importance of fibronectin in the IMAT secretome to
decrease insulin sensitivity in vitro. Preliminary data inform our working hypothesis that IMAT secretion of
fibronectin increases with age due to greater fibroblast content, decreases muscle insulin sensitivity, and is
attenuated after exercise training. In vitro experiments will measure the extent to which IMAT fibronectin
secretion explains IMAT-induced muscle insulin resistance. We propose a coordinated effort between
Colorado and Florida MoTrPAC clinical centers. Both sites will generate IMAT and subcutaneous adipose
tissue conditioned media from fresh tissue, followed by conditioned media analyses and testing of its direct
metabolic effects in vitro in Colorado. IMAT will also be analyzed using single nuclei RNAseq to measure
cell composition. Specific Aim 2 – Evaluate the extent to which age and exercise training alter IMAT
secretion of myostatin, IMAT lymphocyte composition, and the potency of myostatin in the IMAT secretome
to promote sarcopenia in vitro. We hypothesize that the IMAT secretome promotes sarcopenia via
myostatin signaling that increases with age due to greater IMAT lymphocyte content and is attenuated after
exercise training. In vitro experiments will determine the degree to which IMAT myostatin secretion
explains IMAT-induced sarcopenia outcomes. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a
new and substantive departure from the status quo by testing specific IMAT secreted paracrine signals
rather than clinical associations with IMAT content. These contributions will be significant by identifying the

Despite now conclusive evidence that alterations in gut microbial communities precede and contribute to the
etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the promise of therapeutic strategies to favorably
influence this ecology is still largely unrealized. In sharp contrast to the widely understood importance of well-
characterized taxonomic changes that occur during transitions from health to disease, comparatively little is
known about the specific microbially-mediated processes that contribute to this loss of homeostasis. This
disparity is largely due to the fact that even in well-studied communities, such as the human gastrointestinal (GI)
tract, only a small fraction of the genomic content of a sample, the metagenome, can be functionally annotated.
To address this glaring deficiency, we propose to develop a novel computational framework to infer a microbial
gene’s metabolic function using quantitative metagenomics and sequence similarity network analysis. We will
then apply this method to more comprehensively evaluate the role of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in IBD. Sulfur-
metabolizing bacteria are a phylogenetically diverse group of microbes defined by their ability to process dietary
sulfur, often generating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a harmful byproduct. H2S in the GI tract can compromise gut
barrier integrity by causing a breach in the protective mucus bilayer, a necessary precursor to intestinal
inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that higher abundance of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria is associated with
greater disease activity, and this community will prove amenable to selective depletion through food avoidance.
Our overall objective is to comprehensively identify the bacterial species and strains participating in sulfur
metabolism by first cataloging which of them encode known or novel sulfur metabolizing enzymes. We will then
determine how these bacteria, their transcriptional activities, and the metabolites they generate influence disease
severity in a cohort of densely sampled IBD patients who provided stool at up to 24 timepoints over one year
along with short- and long-term assessments of dietary intake. Finally, we will develop and implement a rational
dietary avoidance strategy designed to specifically target these bacteria and starve them of the foods that fuel
this process, concluding with a randomized controlled trial testing this intervention in IBD patients. The scientific
rationale to pursue this line of inquiry is rigorously supported by a body of literature demonstrating that: 1) both
diet and the presence of select sulfur-metabolizing bacteria influence IBD severity and 2) preliminary efforts led
by the candidate reveal that diet may modulate the relative abundance and functional activities of these bacteria.
The approach requires innovative scaling solutions to apply homology-based methods to fully characterize an
entire biochemical pathway—microbial sulfur metabolism—in humans. Anticipated outcomes from this
multidisciplinary effort include the development of an open-sourced methodological framework for hypothesis-
driven microbiome research and the creation of a patient-friendly IBD treatment based on dietary avoidance."

Around 10% of reproductive-age women have endometriosis, but the molecular drivers of this common chronic
gynecologic condition are poorly understood. Endometriosis is a major cause of pain and infertility in women, is
associated with significant financial burden, and multiple comorbidities including pain syndromes, inflammatory
and immune conditions, anxiety, and depression. Staging is commonly used to describe endometriosis in
research and in the clinic, but the biologic underpinnings of each stage are poorly understood. We have
recently performed key studies to map gene expression in endometriosis and endometrioma, uncovering
changes in cell type distribution, gene expression and predicted transcription factor network activities
associated with high or low stage disease. This project will focus on characterizing the epigenome of high and
low stage endometriosis, combining single cell epigenomics and multiome methods with state-of-the-art
analytic methods for dimensionality reduction, allelic imbalance detection and polygenic risk scores. In Aim 1
we will perform large-scale single cell epigenomic profiling to characterize landscapes of disrupted gene
regulation in low and high stage endometriosis; Aim 2 will dissect the allele-specific mechanisms of gene
regulation across endometriosis stages and Aim 3 will develop genetic predictors of outcome in endometriosis.
This project makes use of a large and unique endometriosis cohort study with deep clinical annotation,
longitudinal follow-up and >8000 biospecimens. The collaborative and multidisciplinary team have a track
record in successful collaboration resulting in high-impact research, and are focused on translating the insights
gained to improve diagnostics/screening and/or tools for predicting post-surgical outcomes to help personalize
treatment for endometriosis patients."

Overview: The molecular mechanisms by which corneal nerves regulate limbal stem cells (LSCs), required for
corneal epithelial maintenance and wound healing, and ultimately critical for vision, are unknown. When corneal
nerves are impaired or absent, patients develop nonhealing corneal wounds that lead to permanent blindness,
a condition known as neurotrophic keratopathy (NK). Our objective is to determine the mechanisms by which
corneal nerves govern epithelial renewal. In this research proposal we plan to define key cellular and molecular
regulators of LSCs that will broaden our knowledge of stem cell biology and will enable development of topical
therapeutics for patients with NK. The central hypothesis is that corneal Schwann cells (SCs) are key trophic
regulators of LSC, that, in turn, regulate ocular surface health.
Preliminary studies: In our reported preliminary studies, we combined surgical manipulations, single cell
expression analysis (scRNA-seq) and locally-induced selective cell ablation to identify candidate molecular
mechanisms. We observed that corneal nerve-associated SCs appear to serve as “paracrine factories,”
producing multiple secreted proteins that support corneal epithelial maintenance.
Innovation: To unequivocally determine the mechanisms governing the interactions between SCs and LSCs,
we developed a set of comprehensive approaches using dynamic tracking of corneal cell populations. We
developed a unique NK animal model in which we rescued corneal clarity by surgically introducing a distinct
population of donor nerve cells into denervated corneas, enabling us to probe the role and chronicity of corneal
innervation in epithelial renewal. To track changes in the cells populating the LSC niche, we performed scRNA-
seq analyses comparing healthy, denervated, and de-epithelialized corneas. We observed that SCs regulate
innervation-depended corneal epithelial renewal, forming the basis for a new conceptual model of paracrine
interactions between SCs and LSCs. Based on these preliminary studies, we will (i) define the extent to which
SCs trophically regulate LSC activity, (ii) validate the computationally-predicted library of candidate paracrine
interactions and, among those, define the particular SC-derived trophic factors that directly regulate LSC activity,
and (iii) develop novel comprehensive topical therapeutic strategies to treat patients with NK, for which our
institution has filed a US Patent application.
Impact and Significance: We anticipate that the studies in this proposal will define the mechanisms by which
corneal nerves regulate LSC activity during corneal epithelial wound healing and maintenance. NK, a leading
cause of corneal blindness in Americans, has historically defied definitive treatment. The mechanistic insights
gained will be leveraged clinically in the development of novel, effective topical therapeutics for NK."

Cholera is a deadly diarrheal disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae. It remains poorly
controlled in many parts of the world and outbreaks have been surging despite global efforts to reduce infection.
New antibacterials for Gram-negative bacteria like V. cholerae are greatly needed but are also the most
challenging to make because the outer membrane of these bacteria excludes nearly all molecules from entering
the cell. An innovative strategy to overcome this permeability barrier is shown by the new clinical antibiotic
cefiderocol, which binds outer membrane siderophore receptors and uses active transport systems to enter the
periplasm. Unfortunately, few molecules are known that are capable of this feat, and we have been largely limited
to using siderophore conjugates to develop these innovative Trojan horse antibiotics. Our work on the
understudied class of bacteriocins called microcins provides a rare opportunity to investigate a broader class of
antibacterials with this membrane translocation ability. Microcins are small antibacterial proteins (<10kDa) that
selectively bind Gram-negative outer membrane proteins and hijack active transport processes to enter the
periplasm. Microcins have are effective at controlling bacterial pathogen growth in vivo and have many
characteristics that could make them attractive antibiotic scaffolds. Despite their potential value, advances in
microcin biology have been impeded by the challenges of their identification and the limited characterization of
the only 15 known examples. To overcome the discovery bottleneck, we developed an approach for systematic
identification and validation of new microcins. Coupling an in silico pipeline with a new method for microcin
activity screening, we are identifying microcins across phylogenetically diverse bacteria, including phylogroups
that have never been examined for microcin activity, such as the Vibrionaceae. We have identified potent Vibrio
microcins active against all clinical strains of V. cholerae tested and which we show can be delivered by bacteria
vectors to reduce V. cholerae colonization in mice. Our new appreciation for class II microcin diversity and their
potential to treat V. cholerae infections has made plain the critical need to develop detailed knowledge of their
sequence-activity relationships and ability to prevent and treat gut infections using cell-based delivery vectors to
empower their use in antibiotic development. To pursue these critical gaps in knowledge, we will take advantage
of our exclusive repertoire of unrecognized V. cholerae class II microcins and will (Aim 1) provide the first in-
depth microcin sequence-activity study to uncover domains import for receptor binding, cell entry, and
antibacterial activity, (Aim 2) investigate the use of different delivery bacteria, dosing regime, and microcin
expression systems on microcin efficacy in mouse models, and (Aim 3) expand our understanding of the range
of outer membrane receptors that can be targeted by Vibrio microcins for cell entry."

Non-Hispanic Black/African American (AA) individuals develop non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 5 years
earlier than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. AAs also have a higher lung cancer incidence and
mortality rates. The role of structural racism in the development and maintenance of these disparities has been
understudied. Our long-term goal is to achieve health equity within NSCLC through investigations that benefit
the AA community. The objective of this proposal is to determine the impact of racism-related socio-
environmental factors, including air pollution and residential segregation on the mutagenic process in NSCLC
tumors of AA patients. The central hypothesis is that measurable structural racism stressors induce changes in
mutational processes that negatively impact disease progression in AA patients with early-stage NSCLC. Our
study rationale is that genomic data from AA NSCLC specimens is lacking, which hinders understanding of the
disease etiology and progression in this vulnerable population. For example, only 82 of 1,053 patients in The
Cancer Genome Atlas reported identifying as African American. In addition, it is imperative to determine the
extent to which racism-related socio-environmental factors affect the distribution of mutational signatures in
NSCLC tumors in AA patients in order to identify specific pathways linking structural racism stressors to worse
outcomes and yield targets for intervention and biomarkers for risk stratification. We propose to survey 200 AA
patients with stage I–II NSCLC identified from California and Georgia Cancer Registries and 100 AA from
Detroit to determine their exposure to structural racism stressors, which we will correlate with data from the
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of their tumor tissue. Our aims are to: (1) determine the extent to which
exposure to structural racism over time is linked with differences in NSCLC tumor evolution by characterizing
the types of mutations, the order of their acquisition, and the activity of mutational processes; (2) define the
effect of structural racism stressors on early recurrence (within 2 years of surgery) in stage I-II AA NSCLC
patients and (3) determine the distribution of the genomics of never-smoking AAs with NSCLC compared to the
Sherlock-Lung study and if this distribution is affected by the stressors of interest. This innovative study will be
one of the first to use WGS, tumor evolution, and geospatial analysis techniques to identify causal pathways
linking structural racism stressors to the mutagenic processes of NSCLC, providing a much-needed integration
of social science with molecular outcomes. We expect that the structural racism stressors will induce
differences in timing of driver mutation development that promote early NSCLC recurrence. This study will
elucidate how racism-related socio-environmental factors affect AA NSCLC biology, which is expected to
reveal the mechanisms underlying disparate race-based NSCLC outcomes, ultimately leading to identification
of new targets and development of novel interventions to reduce health disparities."

This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award will facilitate Dr. Jones’ long-term career
goal of conducting translational research focusing on the vascular contribution to cognitive aging in vulnerable
populations, namely individuals living with HIV who are at risk of cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive
impairment, and the benefits of exercise interventions. As age and HIV have independent and synergistic
effects on the brain, it places older people living with HIV (OPWH) at an increased risk of HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorder and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Accelerated vascular aging, assessed
via arterial stiffness, is likely linked to those neurocognitive changes and exercise may be an effective,
nonpharmacological strategy to counterbalance the adverse vascular effects contributing to neurocognitive
disorders. The candidate is an exercise physiologist with a strong background in research on aging and
vascular health and function. The proposed research and career development plan builds directly on my prior
experiences to assess vascular health and function in aging, vulnerable populations. In line with the NIA’s
Strategic Directions of developing effective interventions to reduce the burden of age-related conditions, the
proposed pilot/feasibility study will explore the impact of high-intensity exercise on arterial stiffness and
cognitive functioning among OPWH who have neurocognitive disorders, and refine and finalize elements
critical to conducting future, fully powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the
feasibility (i.e., safety, adherence, retention) and preliminary impact of 12 weeks of high-intensity exercise
compared with continuous moderate exercise on arterial stiffness and cognition. Specific Aim 2 will be guided
by the Theoretical Domains Framework to qualitatively assess the baseline barriers to engagement in exercise
and the participant experiences of the exercise intervention. This award will enhance Dr. Jones’ career
development to conduct future, large-scale RCTs by 1) enhancing his proficiency in HIV and HIV-comorbidity
research, 2) developing expertise in HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and assessment, 3) advancing
knowledge of exercise clinical trial development and implementation, and 4) attaining skills in qualitative
research methods to understand barriers to engagement and participant experiences. Dr. Jones’ mentorship
team is well-suited to facilitate the research and career development plan, with combined expertise in HIV,
cognition, exercise clinical trials, and qualitative methodology."
10837610,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Neutralizing antibodies are a major component of vaccine-induced protective immunity. However, induction of
broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) against the trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) spike protein gp160 continues to
be a challenging goal. An effective vaccine must address the remarkable antigenic variability of gp160, its
extensive glycan shield and/or conformational masking of conserved neutralizing target epitopes. Among bnAb
targets, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41, the Env subunit critical for virus fusion, is
attractive given its linear and highly conserved sequence as validated by the neutralization breadth of 4E10,
10E8 and DH511 bnAbs. Nonetheless, the poorly immunogenic nature of the MPER during the natural course of
infection and the lack of neutralizing activities elicited by structure-based MPER immunogens demand an
alternative immunogen design approach. The accessibility of the MPER is limited, being shielded by gp160
trimer ectodomain from above and the viral membrane from below. Furthermore, our recent MPER/liposome
results suggest that the unrestricted approach angle afforded to the B cell receptor with current vaccine
formulation is problematic, inducing a majority of polyclonal Abs as well as recombinant monoclonal Abs that lack
Env reactivity. Therefore, MPER immunogens must mimic spatial occlusion while enforcing limited Ab
accessibility to the MPER in a manner analogous to that imposed by the quaternary structural configuration of
gp160 on the virion surface. In that regard, our recent analyses of the trimeric HIV-1 Env structure and molecular
dynamics (MD) in nanodiscs provide compelling data for novel vaccine design considerations. With advanced
messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) vaccine technology, Project 1 proposes to create novel
mRNA-based immunogens that encode trimeric spike-MPER-TM (the MPER and adjacent transmembrane
segment) chimeras. Therein the Env ectodomain is replaced by structurally suitable host self-proteins, focusing
Ab responses solely against the conjoint membrane-arrayed viral MPER-TM epitopes. In Aim1, a pipeline
involving automated computational searches of the PDB followed by MD and single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryoEM) structures in collaboration with Project 2 will generate multiple candidate immunogens.
Optimization and further modifications of mRNA-LNP vaccines will be tested by 1) in vitro expression, 2)
antigenicity and antigen presentation, and 3) in vivo immunogenicity studies. The latter use knock-in (KI) mice
harboring introduced human Ig D3-3 and JH6 gene segments for long CDRH3 generation. In Aim 2, genetic,
biochemical and functional characteristics of vaccine-elicited Abs at the single B cell level will be determined and
compared with human bnAbs analyzed structurally in Project 2. The integrated analyses will offer iterative
immunogen improvements to enhance the quantity and quality of anti-MPER Abs. In Aim 3, strategies will be
developed to prime germline bnAb precursors and then selectively expand memory B cells by heterologous
boosting to generate long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow producing high titer bnAbs in plasma."
10837611,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
 There are only a handful of sites on the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) that represent regions of
vulnerability for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Four of these sites are associated with
the gp120 subunit while one of the sites resides in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41.
We previously showed that the MPER is a conserved lipid-immersed, structural element consisting of two
helices separated by a hinge with tandem joints that facilitate viral hemifusion and fusion. MPER-specific
bnAbs manifest extraordinary HIV-1 strain and clade neutralization breadth, exerting anti-viral effect by
disturbing gp41 conformational change required for viral entry into host cells. The MPER is poorly
immunogenic, however, either as a component of the intact gp160 trimeric spike or in the context of an isolated
gp41 subunit immunogen. Our recent cryo-EM and molecular dynamics (MD) studies of membrane-embedded
Env trimers reveal that each MPER protomer radiates toward the 3-fold axis, generating an occluded
membrane-associated tripod structure beneath the upright Env spike. Notwithstanding, spontaneous spike
tilting exposes a 20-Å slot for an Fab arm to insert in a restricted vectorial space. By creating mRNA-based
chimeric vaccines, replacing the Env ectodomain with a trimeric host self-protein protomer linked to a viral
MPER-TM segment as detailed in Project 1, misguiding and sequence-variable viral structural elements are
replaced by a non-immunogenic structure. MPER immunogenicity should then no longer be subdominant. Aim
1 will express these MPER immunogens, incorporate them into nanodiscs and compare their structure and
dynamics, by themselves and in complex with Fabs of interest, with those of gp160 in nanodiscs. Aim 2 will
clone and characterize human-derived MPER-specific IgG1 and IgG3 bnAbs from patient biobanked samples.
Serial longitudinal serological and single memory B-cell analyses will allow for recombinant monoclonal
antibody (rmAb) cloning, thereby defining MPER epitope locales, somatic hypermutation (SHM), neutralization
breadth/potency, affinity, CDRH3 length and lipid binding/polyreactivity, with explicit comparison of IgG1 and
IgG3 isotypes and their aggregate molecular evolution. Aim 3 shall perform X-ray crystallographic studies
using Fabs generated in Aim 2 in complex with MPER epitopes, comparing the features of these bnAbs with
others defined previously in patients as well as those elicited through vaccination in Project 1. Structural and
MD studies of germline and mature IgG1 and IgG3 bnAbs shall reveal whether CH1-CL interdomain motions,
elbow angle flexibility, and/or antibody-to-framework distance are similar or different and impacted by hinge
length. We anticipate that the additional dexterity afforded by the long IgG3 hinge will allow for facile entry of
their Fab arms to approach the MPER, augmenting the ability of unmutated common ancestors (UCAs) and
their progeny with minimal mutation to bind to MPER-containing immunogens."

In 1995, following the Institute of Medicine’s report, “Emerging Infections,” and in response to
the CDC’s strategic plan to enhance surveillance, EMERGEncy ID NET was
established. EMERGEncy ID NET's goal was to address the threat of emerging infectious
diseases by assessing disease prevalence, risk factors, and management practices for acute
presentations from the community among a diverse and underserved population of patients
presenting to US emergency departments (EDs). A CDC cooperative grant has funded the
network for the last 25 years. Due to the ability to prospectively collect clinical data and
specimens for on-site laboratory analysis 24/7 from acutely ill patients from the community,
EMERGEncy ID NET has been able to produce translational research that has impacted
physician practices and informed public health policy. The research network demonstrated its
capability to successfully address an urgent public health threat during the COVID-19 pandemic
by rapidly implementing 20-site and 16-site public health surveillance projects of ED patient
care-related infection risk and vaccine effectiveness among frontline health care personnel.
Numerous peer-reviewed publications have resulted from EMERGEncy ID NET research,
including in high-impact journals such as The New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of
the American Medical Association, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Emerging Infectious Diseases,
and Annals of Emergency Medicine.
 Aims of EMERGEncy ID NET for the next 5 years are to: 1) identify emerging infections
and risk factors for these conditions affecting US ED patients, including among underserved
groups; 2) leverage EMERGEncy ID NET’s findings to create new collaborations to develop and
improve diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines; and 3) disseminate results at national
medical conferences, in high-impact journals, and on infectious diseases, public health, and
emergency medicine social media outlets to inform treatment and public health policy, and
educate the public. Support of EMERGEncy ID NET for the next 5 years will ensure that the
network can continue to answer new questions about emerging infections and related areas of
high public health priority."
10837641,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder that results from exposure to
a traumatic event, is associated with marked deficits in behavioral as well as social and occupational functioning.
United States (U.S.) military Veterans’ risk of developing PTSD is high, lifetime prevalence of PTSD among
Vietnam Veterans is estimated at 19%, while among OEF/OIF soldiers and Veterans, approximately 17% of
active duty soldiers and 25% of reserve soldiers from the Iraq war met criteria for PTSD.
 Current practice for diagnosing and managing PTSD relies primarily on subjective clinical assessments by
clinicians as well as patient self-report. An independent, objective and neuro-physiology based method for
directly assessing brain function is not available, but is much needed to improve diagnosis and management of
PTSD. This need is highlighted by recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Science
(IOM-NAS), which conducted a comprehensive assessment of the current PTSD diagnosis and treatment
methods and identified potential shortcomings of current diagnostic and treatment techniques. A major
recommendation by the IOM-NAS was the urgent need for development of methods for more precise and
objective diagnosis of PTSD and its severity level, objective and faster evaluation of treatment efficacy, and
ability to predict who might be at risk of relapse.
 To address the critical need for developing objective methods for diagnosis of PTSD, determining its severity
level, and potentially predicting treatment response, we propose to test novel biomarkers which are based on
measures of coherent activity among the regions of cerebral cortex during sleep. The selection of this test
condition (sleep) was motivated by the extraordinarily high prevalence of sleep disturbances in individuals with
PTSD, so much so that some have postulated that sleep disturbances are a hallmark feature of the disorder. In
preliminary studies on EEG acquired during sleep from Veterans with PTSD alone (n=38), TBI alone (n=30),
PTSD and TBI (n=25), and no PTSD or TBI control group (n=38), we have shown that a set of neuromarkers
were highly sensitive/specific to the presence of PTSD, and highly sensitive to the severity of symptoms in
PTSD group. The overall goal of this Merit project is to validate this novel neurophysiology marker in: (1)
retrospective study, where the analyses will be applied to a large existing database (n=656) of health-related
quality of life and functional outcome measures, as well as sleep EEG recordings, from Veterans with PTSD
only, with TBI only, with both PTSD and TBI, with depression only ( no PTSD or TBI), and controls (no PTSD,
TBI, Depression, Sleep Apnea), (2) prospective study 1 with PTSD (n=10) and control (n=10) where we will
evaluate potential improvement on the performance of the neuromarkers using a dense array (64 channel)
EEG montage , and (3) prospective study 2 in a cohort (n=50) of Veterans undergoing psychotherapy, where
we will evaluate the sensitivity of neuromarkers to the improvements in PTSD symptoms, and other functional
and health related quality of life measures, in response to psychotherapy."

Primary cilium, a microtubule based antennae-like organelle, is present in every cortical
neuron, and when defective, leads to ciliopathies. A distinguishing feature of
ciliopathies is defective neural circuit formation and function. Disrupted construction
and function of neural circuits in ciliopathies lead to disorders such as autism,
intellectual disabilities, mood disorders, obesity, and epilepsy, thus implying a role for
primary cilia in neuronal function and circuit dynamics. Primary cilia signaling may
serve as a non­synaptic signaling mechanism through which environmental signals can
shape and refine neuronal circuits in health and disease. Nonetheless, how primary cilia
signaling sculpts neuronal circuit dynamics and whether primary cilia can be co-opted
as a therapeutic conduit to mend neural circuit malfunctions remain enigmatic. We aim
to resolve this challenge by defining the signaling mechanisms that are utilized by
primary cilia to enable appropriate neuronal functions necessary for the emergence and
maintenance of functional neural circuits in the brain. We will make this goal attainable
by leveraging the latest advances in optogenetic and chemogenetic interrogation of
signaling emanating from primary cilia, mapping neuronal ciliary receptome, profiling
ciliary connectome within human cerebral cortical circuitry, live imaging cilia driven
neuronal activity and transcriptional changes during neural circuit plasticity in living
animals, and modeling human ciliopathies in brain organoids with the aim of rescuing
circuit malfunctions using primary cilia as a tool. Collectively, this work will reveal how
primary cilia activity is transformed into changes in neuronal circuit function and the
pathways that must be successfully engaged to harness this insight in the service of
ameliorating neural circuit disorders. These outcomes will offer a transformative
opportunity to define new cellular principles of neural circuit formation and function
and will open up new therapeutic avenues of neural circuit correction."

Infection with Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is frequently associated with abuse of psychostimulant
drugs, such as methamphetamine (METH). The interaction of virus and psychostimulant, in particular with regard
to viral persistence, is poorly understood and will be studied here using in vitro and in vivo approaches. We
recently observed that blockade of p38 MAPK and knockdown or deletion of the lncRNA linc02574-201 can
inhibit HIV-1 replication. Therefore, we propose in this application to investigate the mechanism(s) by which
METH apparently promotes HIV-1 infection and the potential contributions of p38 MAPK and lncRNA linc02574-
201. Three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To investigate how methamphetamine (METH) increases HIV-1
infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. This aim will test the hypothesis that
METH exposure affects HIV-1 infection in a concentration- and timing-dependent fashion by promoting the
activity of p38 MAPK and expression of lnRNA linc02574-201. 2) To study how METH interferes with viral
suppression by combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). This aim will investigate how METH exposure affects
viral suppression by cART and the recrudescence of the virus once ARV treatment ceases. This aims will also
assess if inhibition or knockdown of p38 MAPK can prevent the resumption of viral replication after cART, similar
to the knockdown of lncRNA linc02574-201. 3) To assess in a humanized CD34+ HSC-engrafted NSG mouse
model if METH increases the viral reservoir and facilitates the recurrence of HIV during interruption of cART. This
aim will study how METH affects HIV-1 infection, viral suppression by cART and viral recrudescence upon
interruption of cART in an HIV permissive in vivo model, the CD34+ HSC (hematopoietic stem cell)-engrafted
NSG mouse model. The experiments will be performed in vitro with isolated human peripheral blood cells and
cell lines, and in vivo in humanized mice with a CD34+ cell-derived hematopoietic system that provides HIV
permissive human peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages (MΦ). All three Specific Aims will define
RNA signatures of HIV-1 infected CD4+ T-cells and MΦ in the presence and absence of METH using RNA-
sequencing and will test the proposed mechanism, including increased activity of the stress-related p38 MAPK
and up-regulation of lncRNA linc02574-201. The aims will also monitor factors known to support HIV-1 infection,
such as IRF7, and will test the premise that METH exposure down-regulates a subset of ISGs that include
antiviral factors, such as CCL5, Mx1/2, IFITM2/3 and IRF1 and -3."

Our published data reveals that semi quantitative mucus plug scores strongly associate with measures of airway
type 2 inflammation and airflow obstruction in asthma. We have now developed novel approaches to move from
a semi-quantitative mucus plug score to detailed quantitative mucus plug phenotyping (mucus plug number,
size, and location), and this technology allows us to more deeply explore mucus plug biology in asthma. Our
renewal grant application will continue to leverage CT lung images and airway biospecimen resources from the
SARP-3 cohort, take advantage of an imaging team built by Dr Fahy to explore airway mucus plug phenotypes
using CT lung images, and continue an ongoing collaboration between Dr Fahy’s and Dr Seibold’s labs to jointly
tackle disease mechanisms in asthma. Aim 1 will explore relationships between airway mucus plugs, type 2
inflammation and airflow obstruction. Our studies of mucus plugs and type 2 inflammation will include analysis
of airway mucus plugs in SARP-3 patients before and after they were started on therapeutic proteins targeting
the type 2 pathway. Our studies of mucus plugs and airway location are designed to determine the number of
mucus plugs and the airway sizes that are most consequential for airflow limitation. Aim 2 will determine if
treatment with inhaled N-acetylcysteine (NAC) improves airflow in mucus-high asthma. NAC is mucolytic
because it cleaves the excessive disulfide bridges between mucin polymers that increase airway mucus gel
elasticity in asthma. Our clinical trial will directly test the hypothesis that mucus plugs cause airflow limitation in
asthma and determine the influence of mucus plug phenotypes on response to mucolytic treatment. Aim 3 will
determine the role of ITLN1 in the pathophysiology of airway mucus plugs in asthma. Intelectin-1 (ITLN1) is an
epithelial cell protein that is upregulated by IL-13 (a type 2 cytokine), and our preliminary data show that a eQTL
variant in ITLN-1 modifies risk of mucus plugging in asthma. This provided impetus for us to explore mechanisms
of ITLN-1 mediated mucus pathology in bench experiments. Our aims have specific hypotheses, are supported
by robust preliminary data, and are enabled by the application of state of the art imaging, computer vision, and
cellular and molecular methodologies. Our research promises to advance understanding about mucus plug
biology in patients with severe asthma and our data will inform drug development for mucus plugs and the
potential utility of therapeutic bronchoscopy. Most importantly, our CT mucus phenotyping biomarkers will
provide the field with much needed predictive and monitoring biomarker for mucus-high asthma."
10849584,"Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States.
Among them, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is prominent because it is rapidly progressing
and there is no effective cure to date. ALS can be sporadic or familial, and mutations in many
genes were found to contribute to the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic ALS, although
how the malfunction of these genes leads to ALS is still not fully understood. Recently,
mutations in the TBK1 gene were identified in ALS patients. Although the TBK1 gene encodes a
protein kinase that participates in autophagy and inflammation, how such mutations confer ALS
pathogenesis is not well characterized due to the lack of animal models. Fruit flies (Drosophila
melanogaster) are widely used to model human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.
In the fruit fly, the TBK1 orthologue gene IK2 was reported to play roles in caspase activation,
RNA localization, and neuron dendrite remodeling, and the lack of IK2 could lead to a lethal
phenotype. In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of mutant TBK1-associated
ALS, the research proposed here will use Drosophila genetic analysis and cellular and molecular
tools to assess the impact of the overexpression of human wild-type and ALS-mutant TBK1,
along with the loss of the IK2 gene, in fruit flies, with an emphasis on nervous system function.
We plan to address these questions in the following aspects: 1. The behavioral and molecular
changes of fruit flies with the overexpression of wild-type and mutant TBK1 gene or the loss of
IK2 gene; 2. The alteration of molecular pathways in IK2 deficient flies with the overexpression
of wild-type and mutant TBK1 gene or the loss of IK2 gene; 3. The genetic and molecular
interactions of the wild-type or mutant TBK1 gene or altered IK2 gene with other ALS-causing

10838582,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancies and is currently considered
incurable with a 5-7 year median survival. Newer drugs, such as the proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory
drugs and monoclonal antibodies in combination with more traditional drugs enable better clinical responses.
However, development of resistance to these drugs is still the major cause of patient demise. There is also a
significant fraction of newly diagnosed MM patients who are refractory even to these newer drugs and thus have
not benefited from the recent therapeutic advancements. We previously found that many MM patient-derived
bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), a key MM tumor microenvironment cell type, secrete
factor(s) capable of activating transcription factor NF-κB and causing proteasome inhibitor resistance in MM
cells. We now identified HAPLN1 (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1) as a responsible BMSC secreted
factor that also causes such drug resistance in MM cells in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq and bioinformatic analyses
revealed that HAPLN1 induces large-scale transcriptomic changes, including induction of a host of antiapoptotic
genes. Accordingly, HAPLN1 also causes resistance to multiple other drugs in MM cells in vitro. HAPLN1
expression is higher in MM BMSCs relative to normal BMSCs, and proteolytic forms of HAPLN1 are often
detected in bone marrow plasma from highly therapy refractory MM patients. Thus, we hypothesize that HAPLN1
is a new oncogenic factor and multi-drug resistance inducer in MM disease. This hypothesis will be tested by
determining the pathologic role of HAPLN1 in primary MM patient cells and in vivo (Aim 1), elucidating the
mechanism of HAPLN1-mediated drug resistance in MM (Aim 2), and immuno-targeting HAPLN1-mediated drug
resistance in MM (Aim 3). Overall, the proposed study may identify soluble HAPLN1 as a novel marker for
therapy resistance in MM, as well as a new therapeutic target to prevent or reduce the multi-drug resistance
problem in MM."
10838589,"Telomeres protect chromosome ends in eukaryotes. In the absence of telomerase, telomeres shorten, which
eventually leads to senescence. A minority of cells, however, can escape senescence and stabilize telomeres
by a recombination process called Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). ALT is responsible for telomere
maintenance in ~15% of cancers, but it also contributes to stabilization of telomeres in aging or stem cells. Thus,
understanding the ALT mechanism is important to identify factors that can influence whether and how it occurs.
It is also well known that exposure to various environmental stressors and air toxins influence all aspects of
telomere biology and promote telomere-related diseases, including various types of cancer. However, the effects
of environmental factors on ALT and telomere dynamics are difficult to study, owing to the absence of experi-
mental systems to identify and follow the critical steps responsible for ALT establishment in human cells at the
molecular level. A key gap in the study of ALT has been, until recently, the lack of quantitative assays. The goal
of this research is to unravel the mechanisms of ALT by identifying genetic, structural, and environmental factors
affecting ALT. This research takes advantage of a powerful system in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where
ALT was originally discovered and where ALT can be followed from the beginning of telomere erosion through
formation of survivor cells. This research will employ a unique combination of methods that were recently devel-
oped by the applicants that enabled a quantitative study of ALT. This research, so far, has yielded three firsts in
the field: (i) a population genetics-based assay that determined the frequency of ALT, (ii) ultra-long sequencing
described the detailed structure of individual chromosome ends in ALT survivors, and (iii) a combination of com-
putational modeling, Southern blot analysis and PacBio sequencing uncovered “molecular milestones” repre-
senting different steps of ALT in large populations of yeast cells. Using these new approaches, this research will
determine the effects of genetic, chromosome-structural and environmental factors during the steps of ALT,
including: (i) the formation of ALT precursor cell populations initiated by eroded chromosome ends; (ii) the de-
velopment of ALT survivors taking place in such populations; (iii) the frequency of ALT outcomes, and (iv) the
molecular structure of chromosome ends in ALT survivors. This research will test the effect of environmental
stressors on ALT, including oxidative damage from paraquat and the effect of cadmium, a ubiquitous environ-
mental pollutant and a type I carcinogen. This will provide insight into molecular effects of environmental factors
as well as illuminate new molecular mechanisms of ALT formation, potentially uncovering opportunities for med-
ical interventions. Furthermore, this research will establish a robust system to evaluate the influence of other
environmental contaminants on ALT, and to utilize telomere erosion and ALT formation as a new type of biosen-
sor to assess the effects of various genetic changes and environmental assaults on genetic stability. Overall,
this study of ALT in yeast is expected to serve as a roadmap to perform quantitative studies of ALT in humans."
10838460,"Project Summary
 Aphasia, an acquired language disorder, is a common post-stroke condition that devastates patients’ ability
to engage in social situations, participate in preferred activities, and often regain a high quality of life after a
stroke. Aphasia recovery is often greatest during the subacute post-stroke phase (~ 2 weeks to 6 months post-
stroke) due to neuroplasticity (i.e., reorganization of brain function and behavior relationships). Yet, the extent of
subacute aphasia recovery varies widely between individuals, and current predictive models based on
demographic and lesion data do not fully account for inter-individual variability in recovery. Early post-stroke
recovery predictions are likely to improve with the inclusion of information about brain network function, yet very
little is currently known about the functional connectivity correlates of language changes that occur over the
subacute phase in people with aphasia (PWA). This research aims to address this gap. Twenty-five PWA in the
subacute phase (£ 3 months post-stroke onset at study entry) and 25 neurotypical controls will participate in the
proposed research. At study entry, all participants will complete language testing, resting-state functional Near-
Infrared Spectroscopy (rs-fNIRS), and structural MRI. PWA will complete testing and rs-fNIRS again at the onset
of the early chronic phase (~ 6-8 months post-stroke). fNIRS will be used in this research to index brain network
function as it is a flexible, portable alternative to fMRI that is more accessible to patients in early post-stroke
stages. Language impairments will be captured by measures of semantics and phonology, linguistic domains
that underlie receptive and expressive language deficits in PWA and provide more specific information than
global language measures regarding impairment locus. Through three study aims, we will determine the
subacute rs-fNIRS functional connectivity patterns that (1) are associated with subacute language deficits, (2)
change over time and are related to longitudinal language changes, and (3) predict language gains by the early
chronic stroke stage. Across aims, we predict that stronger/increased left intra- and inter-hemispheric
connectivity will be associated with better/improved language skills in PWA, consistent with prior subacute stroke
fMRI work. We additionally hypothesize that relationships between functional connectivity and language will be
spatially localized to ventral stream regions for semantics and dorsal stream regions for phonology, consistent
with modern models of the neurobiology of language. By achieving these aims, this project will advance our
understanding of the nature of beneficial neural reorganization of language during the crucial subacute to early
chronic post-stroke recovery window. This line of work will provide a foundation for building computational
recovery models that incorporate multimodal brain function and brain structure data in PWA. Integration of these
types of data will also guide decisions regarding the timing and type of language and non-invasive brain
stimulation therapies patients should receive to maximize their recovery during the subacute stroke phase."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Radial progenitors serve as an instructive matrix to coordinate the generation and placement of
appropriate number and types of neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. Radial progenitors
divide asymmetrically to generate neurogenic intermediate progenitors (IPs) and the symmetric
proliferation of IPs serves to rapidly expand cortical neuronal population. The dynamic
maintenance of the balance between radial and intermediate progenitors is of fundamental
importance to the generation of right number and types of projection neurons at the right time
in the cerebral cortex. Once generated, growth and connectivity of cortical neurons enables the
formation of basic neuronal circuitry in the cerebral cortex. The balanced diversity of cortical
progenitors and the resultant generation, placement, and connectivity of projection neurons
thus serve as a blueprint to guide the formation of an appropriately wired cerebral cortex.
Disruptions in these essential features of the developing cerebral cortex are at the core of many
human neurodevelopmental disorders including microcephaly, macrocephaly, lissencephaly,
epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. However, the molecular logic that
instructs progenitor balance and projection neuronal connectivity remains an enigma. This
proposal aims to remedy this gap in our understanding of cerebral cortical formation. In
particular, (1) we will discover how the developmental balance between radial and intermediate
progenitors, vital for the production of right number and types of cortical neurons at the right
time, is achieved, (2) define hitherto uncharted, primary cilia-mediated mechanisms guiding
projection neuronal growth and connectivity, and (3) determine how changes in these
developmental processes can cause cortical malformations underlying human
neurodevelopmental disorders. We aim to make these goals attainable by using an innovation
driven approach that involves combined application of latest advances in progenitor or neuron
type specific mouse genetic models, live imaging, lineage tracing, mapping of signaling
interactomes, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of primary cilia signaling, single cell
genomics, and functional evaluation of human mutations associated with neurodevelopmental
disorders. Understanding how progenitors and neurons are assembled, organized, and
connected appropriately to facilitate cerebral cortical formation, offers us the opportunity to
rethink and redraw the rules of corticogenesis in the service of better diagnostic and therapeutic
insights into neurodevelopmental disorders."
10838463,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The number of Americans over age 65 is 49.2 million in 2016, and it is expected to be 78 million in 2035
(U.S. Census). People over age 65 typically suffer from increased white adipose tissue (WAT) accumulation,
especially in the visceral (abdominal) area. Visceral adiposity accelerates aging by promoting insulin
resistance, cardiovascular dysfunction, and many other chronic health conditions, significantly shortening
healthspan and lifespan. Thus, preventing or reducing adipose tissue accumulation is critical for healthy aging.
Unfortunately, the relationship between aging and adipose tissue accumulation is poorly understood.
Adipocytes (fat cells) undergo hypertrophy (cell enlargement) during aging, but it remains unclear if adipose
tissue also expands through adipogenesis (the generation of new adipocytes), which will grant adipose tissue
with unlimited potential to grow. The rate of adipogenesis is very low in young mice, similar to that in young
humans. Preliminary data of this proposal show the first cellular evidence that WAT expands with age through
massive adipogenesis. Thus, in contrast to most adult stem cells that exhibit a reduced ability to proliferate and
differentiate, adipogenesis of preadipocytes is unlocked by aging. The goal of this R01 proposal is to determine
when, where, and why does adipogenesis take place during aging. Based on the preliminary findings, the
hypothesis is that aging generates new preadipocytes which undergo adipogenesis to become new
adipocytes, and the stromal microenvironment generated by cellular senescence plays a key role in this
process. Proposed experiments in Aim 1 will utilize the AdipoChaser mice to determine the exact age stage
when adipogenesis takes place, and use MuralChaser mice to determine the percentage of new preadipocytes
generated during aging and their rate of adipogenesis. Unbiased single-cell sequencing will also be used to
identify preadipocyte subpopulations newly generated during aging. Proposed experiments in Aim 2 will
perform both in vitro differentiation assays and in vivo transplantations to determine the contribution of cell-
autonomous effect of preadipocytes, paracrine stimulation, and systemic stimulation to age-associated
adipogenesis. Proposed experiments in Aim 3 will determine whether eliminating senescent cells prevents
age-associated adipogenesis. The proposed research provides new scientific knowledge that adipogenesis is
the major contributor to age-associated adiposity, and mechanistic insights into why adipogenesis is unlocked
by aging. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide new therapeutic avenues for the
prevention and treatment of age-associated adiposity and its related chronic diseases, ultimately promoting
longevity and healthy aging."
10838464,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We will address two fundamental aspects of biology in Drosophila. The first involves the mechanisms
regulating the onset of differentiation of a naïve embryonic genome. Developmental time resolves progressive
steps that introduce the specialized domains of chromatin structure. We found that the molecular hallmarks of
heterochromatin emerge late, after heterochromatic behaviors that the marks were thought to specify. We will
explore the mechanisms establishing the earlier specializations of heterochromatin domains. Clustered arrays
of repeated sequences (satellites) become late replicating in the 14th cell cycle prior to histone methylation
(H3K9me) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) binding. We found that regulated recruitment of Rif1, a
replication inhibitor, explains developmental onset of late replication, and that a temporal schedule of its
dissociation directs a temporal program of sequential replication of the satellites. We will use powerful in vivo
tools to understand how time is programmed. But what targets Rif1 to satellite sequences? We found that the
satellite sequences are compacted even earlier, prior to Rif1 recruitment, but then what is the basis of
compaction? Repetitiveness is the universal distinguishing feature of satellite sequences. Recently, our
neighbor Sy Redding and the Rosen lab showed that in vitro assembled chromatin with nucleosomes
periodically positioned on repetitive sequences autonomously condenses into a liquid-like phase. In
collaboration with Sy Redding we will relate the simple physical observations and in vivo behavior of satellite
repeats. The approaches taken here will define the progression of interactions that evolution selected to guide
the initial formation of distinct genomic subdivisions that underlie much of complex metazoan biology.
 The second project examines the genetic independence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome. Despite its
bacterial origins, the mt genome is viewed as well adapted; however, an independently transmitted genetic
element always has a renegade option. It is cooperative only as long as it is advantageous. The distinct
genetics of the multicopied maternally transmitted mt genome is usually learned as uncomplicated, but this is
belied by complexities in the transmission of disease mutations and age dependent onset of phenotypes.
Inadequate genetic tools have hidden important features of mt genome behaviors that we have accessed with
new tools. We show that the ability of a mutant mt genome to compete with the pool of other genomes in a cell
determines its fate. The nuclear genome manipulates this inter-mt genome competition to give beneficial
outcomes, but fragile points in this nuclear management allow successful transmission of some mutant
genomes and underlie an age-associated decline in mt genome integrity. We propose experiments that will
dissect the basis of nuclear management of the mt genome. Identifying modulating nuclear activities will
enhance predictability of mt disease severity and introduce new avenues for their therapeutic management."

Membrane proteins are responsible for controlling the passage of nutrients, waste, energy and information in
and out of cells. They are critical players in physiology and key targets for pharmacological regulation, however,
we lack a fundamental understanding of why these proteins are thermodynamically stable in cell membranes.
Simply put, why does a greasy protein surface find its greasy protein partner in the greasy lipid bilayer to
assemble faithfully into its stable, native structure? In order to investigate this question, the Robertson laboratory
has developed a robust and rigorous model system to study equilibrium protein association in membranes based
on the reversible dimerization of the CLC-ec1 Cl-/H+ antiporter. Through the development of fluorescence and
single-molecule microscopy approaches, it is now possible to experimentally conduct a full thermodynamic
analysis of the CLC dimerization reaction in lipid bilayers, yielding the free energy of association (ΔG°) and free
energy changes (ΔΔG) due to mutations or different lipid conditions. Recent advances have allowed us to study
CLC equilibrium as a function of temperature, enabling a van 't Hoff analysis to dissect the thermodynamic
changes in enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) upon dimerization. In addition, we have developed methods for
measuring equilibrium kinetics of CLC dimerization in a tractable manner - in the membrane and in real-time.
With this foundation in place, the Robertson lab is primed to build a full molecular model of CLC dimerization in
membranes. In the next phase of this project, we will investigate the hypothesis that CLC subunits are driven to
associate due to differential solvent dependent driving forces in the associated and dissociated states, and that
the transition state involves a critical solvation/de-solvation step. We will investigate this along three distinct
aims, by building a theoretical model of the CLC dimerization free energy in membranes using computational
approaches (Aim 1), connecting the CLC sequence and structure to dimerization through experimental
measurements of thermodynamics and kinetics (Aim 2), and developing a guest-host approach to experimentally
and theoretically quantify the impact of mixed lipid composition on protein association equilibria in membranes
(Aim 3). Throughout each of these studies, we integrate experiments and theory hand-in-hand, enabling us to
make robust connections between physical driving forces and molecular mechanisms. Regardless of the validity
of our hypothesis, our studies will provide meaningful quantitative information to the study of membrane proteins
in membranes. Ultimately, we expect that the results from these studies will provide a foundation for the field to
build new strategies for targeting membrane protein stability and mis-folding based on fundamental physical
principles."

The overarching goal of our Training Program is to prepare MD, MD/PhD pediatricians, and PhD scientists for
careers in independent research on topics relevant to digestive diseases in infancy, childhood, and adult life.
The rationale for our program is founded upon the idea that meaningful and strong intellectual, mentoring, and
financial support for newly emerging scientists will enable the recruitment of talented young people to our field
and foster early success in their long-term career development as effective independent investigators pursuing
meaningful science relevant to health and disease of the alimentary tract. We offer training in 4 broad areas
relevant to our field of gastroenterology: 1) Epithelial Cell and Molecular Biology - including Stem
Cell/Developmental Biology and Enteric Neurobiology; 2) Innate and Adaptive Mucosal Immunology; 3) Microbial
Pathogenesis, Gut Microbiome, and effects on Metabolism; and 4) Clinical Research. The training program
provides an in-depth comprehensive and strongly mentored scientific experience for each trainee in a research
group at the forefront of its field. Eight postdoctoral positions are requested. 35 NIH-funded highly accomplished
core research faculty support this effort, providing great depth and diversity of scientific training and over $52
million in combined current research support. Opportunities for cross-fertilization among faculty members and
their trainees are abundant.
 The Program Director is Dr. Scott B. Snapper MD PhD, Egan Family Professor of Pediatrics, Harvard
Medical School, and a widely respected investigator and mentor. Program steering committee includes Drs.
Wayne Lencer MD, Meena Rao MD PhD, Jon Kagan PhD and Rachel Rosen MD MPH. An External Advisory
Board provides oversight to the program. Scholarship Oversight Committees (SOCs) are assembled for each
trainee to provide oversight (and further mentoring) in personal scientific and career development. Didactic
course work is encouraged for both basic and clinical research training and supplemented with relevant seminars
and journal clubs, a course in the responsible conduct of research, and an annual research retreat. For clinical
research trainees, the program supports matriculation through a Master’s Degree in Medical Science or Public
Heath (MMSc or MPH) from Harvard Medical School or Harvard School of Public Health.
 Since 1997, 72 (70%) of our past 103 Trainees remain in academics, 20 (19%) in industry, 4 (4%) in
government (NIH/FDA), and only 7 (7%) are in clinical practice or have left academics. 18% of our past Trainees
have achieved independent NIH research awards (RO1 or equivalent), 32% have achieved NIH K-series awards,
and 57% have achieved other NIH (e.g., F32), Foundation, or other (institutional) Career Development Awards.
Our T32 training program continues to have a broad-based effort to recruit URM trainees and faculty. Importantly,
our program has populated the faculty of academic institutions across the nation and internationally."
10849231,"This proposal is for the renewal of a predoctoral and postdoctoral Quantitative Neuroscience Training Program
(QNTP) at Princeton University. Neuroscience research is becoming increasingly quantitative. Formal theoretical
techniques are essential for understanding how complex, large-scale interactions between neurons give rise to
thought and behavior, and advanced quantitative methods of data analysis are necessary for addressing the
increasingly large, multidimensional data sets generated by modern brain imaging techniques (e.g., multiunit
recording, fMRI). These methods are also necessary for future progress to be made in understanding,
diagnosing, treating and, ultimately, curing brain disturbances that give rise to psychiatric disorders.
Unfortunately, the mathematical and computational skills required to address these needs are not a focus of
standard neuroscience curricula. Princeton’s QNTP is designed to address this need, by providing the next
generation of neuroscientists with the necessary mathematical and computational skills for measuring, analyzing,
and modeling brain function. The establishment of the QNTP sparked several developments at Princeton, that
(in turn) have accelerated the pace at which the goals of the QNTP are being met. By bringing Princeton’s
neuroscientists together with faculty in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, the QNTP
helped to spur the formation of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) in 2005. The QNTP also helped to
inspire the formation (in 2008) of PNI’s free-standing PhD Program in Neuroscience, which strongly emphasizes
classroom and laboratory training in basic quantitative and computational methods during its first two years.
These developments have made it possible for us to refocus the QNTP from its original purpose (providing a
foundation in quantitative neuroscience for trainees who are starting out in this area) to providing advanced
training in quantitative neuroscience. Specifically, we will take the most quantitatively-focused subset of our
predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees and provide them with the additional tools and training that they need to
excel in computational neuroscience research. This training will be accomplished via advanced quantitative and
computational neuroscience elective courses that were developed for the QNTP and are taught by leaders in
the field, as well as participation in research seminars, journal clubs, and career development activities that are
designed to deepen the trainees’ knowledge and bolster community among the trainees. PNI faculty have made
seminal contributions to quantitative neuroscience, ranging from information-theoretic analyses of neuronal
spiking and dynamical systems analysis of decision-making to multivariate decoding of human neuroimaging
data. The QNTP has been specifically formulated to bring predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees into contact with
this expertise and, through this, to catalyze their transformation into full-fledged computational neuroscientists.
Given the sustained increase in the number of faculty and our graduate student cohorts, we are requesting
support for six predoctoral trainees and six postdoctoral trainees (with 2 year appointments for each trainee)."

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive condition in aging men that is characterized by the
enlargement of the periurethral regions of the prostate gland. An estimated 50% of men have histologic evidence
of BPH by age 50 years and 75% by age 80 years. BPH is often accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS). BPH is rarely fatal, but may cause serious life-threatening complications such as acute urinary retention
if left untreated. However, molecular mechanisms of BPH initiation and progression remain incompletely
understood. The lack of understanding of these mechanisms is a barrier to improved treatment. BPH is a
heterogeneous disease that results from nonmalignant proliferations of both the prostate epithelial and stromal
compartments. The stromal nodules and the epithelial glandular nodules are the two typical nodules in BPH.
Histological comparison of the stromal nodules with human fetal prostate stroma revealed that the ontogenetic
processes of fetal prostate stroma (a transition from immature mesenchymal phenotype to fibroblastic,
fibromuscular, and ultimately smooth-muscular phenotype) are recapitulated in the development of the BPH
stromal nodules. This observation supports a theory of embryonic “reawakening”, which proposes that improper
reactivation of embryonic signaling like FGFs attributes to initiation and progression of these stromal nodules.
Formation of glandular nodules is suggested to develop as a result of stromal hyperplasia and deregulated
stromal-epithelial interaction. But the underlying molecular mechanisms for glandular nodules have not been
defined definitively. Our preliminary study shows that the Wnt signaling is active in prostate stromal cells and is
capable of regulating the prostate epithelial stem cell activity. The goal of this application is to use a combination
of molecular and cellular biological approaches, genetically engineered mouse models, and human BPH
specimens to investigate how the Wnt signaling in prostate stromal cells is altered in BPH and how it affects
BPH pathogenesis."

This study is focused on expanding our understanding of post-stroke cognitive impairment and
dementia (PSCID). Studies have found that patients who suffer a stroke are at increased risk for
developing subsequent cognitive decline. While this has been demonstrated epidemiologically,
the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. PSCID is a form of vascular cognitive
impairment and dementia (VCID). VCID has been linked to progressive changes in the white
matter, referred to as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), that are readily seen on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). It has been hypothesized that disruption of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) precedes the development of WMH. Thus, imaging the BBB may be a way to determine
who is at risk for developing VCID. It is the central hypothesis of this proposal that PSCID is due
to acceleration of VCID brought on by the acute ischemic event and is characterized by global
disruption of the BBB which precedes the development of WMH. Thus we aim to: 1) Test if BBB
disruption detected on routine clinical MRI scans of the brain is predictive of PSCID, 2) Study
the mechanism of progressive WMH in post-stroke patients using serial research MRI scans to
measure BBB disruption of normal appearing white matter before it progresses to WMH, and 3)
Translate a novel MRI method into the clinical setting that uses arterial spin labeling (ASL) to
measure BBB disruption without the administration of exogenous contrast. To achieve these
objectives patients will be recruited from hospitals in the Johns Hopkins Health System. Patients
will be followed with serial cognitive testing to detect cognitive decline over a 3-year period. BBB
measurements will be extracted from the MRI scans done at the time of the evaluation for acute
stroke. A subset of patients will be followed with serial research MRIs. Research MRIs will be
used to track the progression of NAWM to WMH and its relationship to BBB disruption. These
research MRIs will also implement a novel ASL method for measuring BBB permeability to
determine if this method could be used instead of contrast-based methods. The long-term goal
of this research is to validate a biomarker for the pathogenesis of PSCID such that patients at
risk can be identified for therapeutic trials and potential therapeutics can be screened for their
effect on the pathology."

Here we propose a Systems Biology Core (SBC) for the Accelerating Medicines Partnerships in Autoimmune
and Immune-Mediated Diseases (AMP AIM). The AMP AIM will use high dimensional molecular and cellular
assays to define the key cell states, pathways, and molecular components of tissue inflammation and damage
by examining patient tissue and blood samples. Ultimately, we seek to define the components of tissue
inflammation in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including psoriatic spectrum diseases (PSD),
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), and other related
conditions. AMP RA/SLE initiated this process by querying 106 single cells in inflamed RA synovial and SLE
nephritis tissue samples using multimodal strategies; it defined key cell states in tissue inflammation, including
T peripheral helper T cells (Tph), GZMK+ CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR+THY1+ fibroblasts, and autoimmune-
associated B cells (ABCs). Now, to understand how these and emerging cell-states function and interact to
cause disease, it will be essential to obtain high dimensional data on patient sample data across a spectrum of
diseases and disease sub-phenotypes. These data may capture the cellular states; the spatial localization of
cell states, proteins and transcripts; histological features; and other tissue parameters. A powerful and skilled
team that is able to define strategies to analyze this data, integrate multiple modalities of data, and integrate
results from across a diverse set of diseases and tissues will be essential to the success of this program.
We build from our experience leading the Systems Biology Group within the Accelerating Medicines
Partnerships Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (AMP RA/SLE). We have built a team
that is skilled at analysis of diverse modalities and computational biology. We have specific experience and
expertise in inflammatory diseases. Here we propose to:
 (1) Develop Tools and Technology to analyze high dimensional cellular and molecular data. This includes
 optimizing existing bioinformatics and computational tools. It also includes developing new
 computational and statistical methods to integrate high dimensional data manifestation of disease.
 (2) Enable collaboration throughout the network and facilitate systems level analysis. We envision that this
 is an integrated activity with the network, where we will devise and ultimately create an integrated
 model of tissue inflammation across diseases to define features that drive clinical disease. This will
 require the development of new statistical and computational methods. It will also require tight
 collaboration within the network including data synchronization, storage, sharing, and clinical data
 integration. In addition, we will engage the network by offering consultation, technical support and
 training in high dimensional data analysis.

10850257,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Elimination of integrated, replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses from host genomes persisting despite
suppressive anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is the major roadblock to a functional cure. Cells harboring these types
of proviruses produce marginal levels of viral products thereby becoming refractory to immune surveillance
mechanisms. This lack of detection by the immune system, in addition to its increased growth potential, due to
homeostatic proliferation and clonal expansion, extend the lifespan of latently infected cells generating a
persistent HIV-1 reservoir. There is enormous enthusiasm for the potential of precision therapies targeting the
latent reservoir in clinical settings. To achieve this major biomedical goal, the characterization of novel basic
regulatory mechanisms can pave the way to devise alternative therapeutic approaches.
 A large body of work has proposed that HIV-1 latency maintenance and reactivation is regulated by histone
modifications. Previous studies mainly focused on the repressive roles of histone modifications involved in
latency maintenance and their targeting for latency reversal. However, we have made the unexpected
observation of selective H3K9me3 deposition at the provirus 3’-end during latency reactivation. This result was
surprising because H3K9me3 is typically seen as a repressive histone modification, which was counterintuitive
with the viral latency reversal phenotype. Despite this well-established role, H3K9me3 has also been linked to a
pathway of DNA double strand breaks repair. Given these knowledge, two possible models on the function of
H3K9me3 at the provirus 3’-end arise. On the viral model, it is possible that H3K9me3 deposition is used by the
provirus during latency reactivation to regulate its own gene expression. On the host model, it is possible that
H3K9me3 deposition is used by host cells to initiate a process of repair of damaged DNA arising as a
consequence of the high levels of transcription accumulated during the exponential phase of latency reactivation.
 In this exploratory and developmental R21 grant application, we will test these two models using a series
of genetic approaches in immortalized and primary models of latency. If successful, our studies will fill a void in
our understanding of HIV-1 latency biology by describing the functions of H3K9me3 deposition at the provirus
3’-end and the enzymes implicated. In keeping with NIAID’s mission of ending the HIV-1 epidemic, our long-term
objective is to leverage the basic discoveries to devise novel alternative strategies for the selective elimination
of inducible HIV-1 proviruses. As such, this fundamental knowledge can be used in future studies beyond the
scope of this focused grant application, to therapeutically inhibit select H3K9 methyl transferases to sensitize
cells to the natural process of latency reactivation. Collectively, the proposed research will have a sustained

A mature arteriovenous (A-V) fistula is the preferred dialysis access due to its higher patency rates and lower medical costs compared to synthetic grafts and central venous catheters. However, ~40% of newly created fistulas fail to mature, i.e., they are not usable for dialysis because stenosis prevents them from reaching the necessary blood flow. There is paucity of research into the mechanisms underlying postoperative stenosis in A-V fistulas, despite its negative impact on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life of these patients. This translational proposal establishes the mechanistic relationship among the CXCL12 and PU.1/calprotectin signaling network, inward remodeling, and fistula outcomes in order to design targeted therapies to prevent maturation failure. Our proposal is built on strong scientific premises that suggest a mechanistic relationship between postoperative accumulation of calprotectin in A-V fistulas caused by ectopic expression of the transcription factor PU.1 and inward remodeling that causes fistula failure. Our overarching hypothesis is that smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived calprotectin increases the risk for stenosis and failure in newly created A-V fistulas. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that elevated CXCL12 level in hemodialysis patients leads to ectopic expression of PU.1 in the vasculature and the subsequent accumulation of calprotectin in SMCs. The released calprotectin exacerbates inflammation, fibrosis, and intimal hyperplasia (IH) after fistula creation. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims and five experimental layouts that will prove: 1) the contribution of calprotectin to fistula inward remodeling; 2) the underlying mechanisms by which CXCL12 and PU.1 increases calprotectin and the risk of A-V fistula failure; and 3) the relationship between PU.1 and fistula maturation outcomes in a human cohort. We will combine fine microsurgical techniques and knockout mice to successfully achieve our goals. We will also interrogate a human biorepository of 100 randomly selected patients undergoing creation of two-stage brachiobasilic transposition fistulas to search for associations between the levels of PU.1 after venous remodeling and inadequate maturation. In conclusion, with the successful accomplishment of this proposal, we are paving the way for the design of new drugs and cell type-specific interventions to effectively target A-V fistula fibrosis and IH and reduce vascular access complications."

This proposal investigates why burns cause more severe liver damage in older individuals and devises an
innovative treatment strategy to counter this damage alongside a novel diagnostic approach for earlier
detection. This endeavor is crucial given the significantly higher mortality rate in older burn victims compared to
younger patients, necessitating age-specific interventions. Burn injuries have been found to affect multiple
organs, including the liver, which is highly susceptible to damage due to its unique structure and blood supply.
This project focuses on burn-induced liver damage, a well-documented yet untreatable issue particularly
prevalent in elderly populations. Our proposed studies investigate the role of MCJ (Methylation-controlled J
protein), a protein that negatively regulates mitochondrial metabolism in hepatocytes (liver cells) following burn
injuries in aged mice. We particularly focus on age-related factors such as increased production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, which can modulate mitochondrial respiration and potentially cause liver injury. This
innovative approach will employ state-of-the-art methods for diagnosing mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction
and oxidative damage, as well as assessing liver function. Our preliminary data show increased MCJ
expression in the livers of aged mice postburn in settings of heightened age-related hepatic inflammation.
Furthermore, in vivo MCJ silencing in hepatocytes of aged mice reduced postburn mortality. From these
observations, we hypothesize that the inflammatory response after burn injury in aged subjects upregulates
MCJ expression in hepatocytes, leading to reduced mitochondrial respiration and subsequent liver damage
and dysfunction. We also predict that therapeutic silencing MCJ in hepatocytes can be a novel strategy to
attenuate the aberrant hepatic response to burn in older subjects. To test this hypothesis in Aim 1, we will
investigate how MCJ alters mitochondrial respiration in hepatocytes of aged mice postburn, potentially leading
to liver damage. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), on postburn mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and MCJ
upregulation. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will explore a novel liver-focused treatment using small interfering RNA
conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAC-siMCJ) for reducing postburn liver damage in aged mice by
silencing MCJ specifically in hepatocytes. In parallel, we aim to evaluate the potential of MCJ (DnajC15) mRNA
serum levels as a biomarker of liver damage in burn patients. This proposal holds transformative potential in
human health, particularly for aging burn victims. By innovating therapeutic approaches, we aim to significantly
reduce mortality rates and improve prognoses. Additionally, considering the heightened vulnerability of the
elderly population to liver diseases, our research could drastically affect a broad spectrum of liver pathologies.
Essentially, our work seeks to unravel the complex interplay between age, burns, and liver damage, laying a
solid foundation for pivotal future research and clinical applications."
10860223,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social behavior comprises multiple distinct types of interactions that play a critical role in reproduction, survival,
and over-all well-being. Dysfunction of the serotonin system has long been associated with social deficits present
in a host of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and
autism spectrum disorders. It is therefore not surprising that therapeutics targeting the serotonin system, such
as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly prescribed. Unfortunately, they are often
ineffective in improving deficits in social behavior.
Accumulating evidence supports the notion that alterations in chromatin remodelers and transcription factors
play a critical role in the development of a host of disorders. Recent findings demonstrate that selective deletion
of the chromatin remodeling subunit, Arid1b, in serotoninergic neurons results in social deficits in mice.
Interestingly, rapid elevation of serotonin levels enhances sociability and promotes appropriate social behavior.
These findings suggest that the speed and degree of serotonin enhancement is a critical regulator of its
therapeutic effects. Think of the cooling effects of using a folding fan on a humid summer day in comparison to
that of having central air conditioning on full blast. This analogy illustrates the difference in serotonin elevation
due to SSRIs versus the potent serotonin releaser MDMA, used in our studies.
Unfortunately, this effect is only temporary, and deficits resume when serotonin levels return to baseline.
However, our preliminary data suggests that a simple 2-dose MDMA regimen can cause lasting increases in
sociability in mice with this genetic deletion. The goal of this project is to identify the circuit, cellular, and molecular
adaptations underlying this potential groundbreaking therapeutic phenomenon. By studying the neural
mechanisms underlying sociability, we aim to shed light on a critically important element of the human
experience, suggesting a novel approach to effective treatments for this devastating component of many
neuropsychiatric disorders."

PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) is a population-based risk factor surveillance
system designed to identify and monitor behaviors and experiences of women before, during, and after
pregnancy. In April of 2006, the Wyoming Department of Health was awarded a grant from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish PRAMS in Wyoming. Wyoming is focused on
illuminating disparities within the state. The PRAMS project oversamples mothers of low birth weight
infants and American Indian women. These women are oversampled to obtain adequate representation
for analysis. Additional populations of interest include women receiving Medicaid and women enrolled
in the Women, Infants, and Children’s (WIC) program during pregnancy.
PRAMS data is collected by surveying a monthly sample of approximately 100 Wyoming women who
had a live birth in the past two to six months. Wyoming PRAMS uses a combination of two data
collection approaches: statewide mailings of the surveys and telephone follow-up with women who do
not return the survey by mail. The written questionnaires and telephone interviews can both be
completed in Spanish when necessary. Wyoming plans to add a third source of contact via email
beginning in 2021. Email should allow women, who previously had been unable to be contacted via
phone or mail, to be otherwise reached."
10840785,"Summary: Despite their high prevalence, the molecular basis for common genitourinary (GU) congenital defects
is poorly understood. We have identified and validated gene lesions at the KCTD13/16p11.2 locus as
responsible for lower GU tract abnormalities, particularly cryptorchidism and hypospadias. KCTD13
encodes a substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which
regulates the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration via ubiquitination and degradation of RHOA. Notably, RHOA
has been implicated in the maintenance of Sertoli-germ cell junctions to promote gametogenesis and gonads
development. E3 ubiquitin ligases also regulate the androgen receptor (AR), which is key to male genitalia
development and differentiation. We found that KCTD13 is robustly expressed in the GU tract and have recently
shown that in comparison to normal controls, gene copy number variants are remarkably common in patients
with GU birth defects. Moreover, we obtained in vitro and in vivo evidence that KCTD13 loss affects AR levels
in testis and penis. We also observed that haploinsufficient and Kctd13 deficient mice had significantly higher
incidence of cryptorchidism and decreased size of testes, seminal vesicles and penis size in conjunction with
spermatogenic defects, causing severe subfertility. Further, Kctd13 null mice revealed a significant decrease in
masculinization factor SOX9 levels and concomitant upregulation of the feminization factor RHOA. While our
collective data suggest a key role of KCTD13 in male GU development, the mechanisms of how this molecule
impinges upon the AR and/or SOX9 axes remain a major gap of knowledge. We hypothesize that gene dosage
changes in KCTD13 alter the signaling of the masculinization axes, leading to abnormal GU tract
development, defective gonad formation, undervirilization, and subfertility. In line with our reasoning, we
will test two plausible independent mechanisms by which KCTD13 mediates lower GU tract development and
differentiation. First, we hypothesize and test that gene dosage changes in KCTD13 affect GU tract development
by affecting AR degradation, subcellular localization and downstream gene targets (AIM 1). Second, we
hypothesize and test that KCTD13 affects the expression of masculinization factor SOX9 directly by modulating
SOX9 ubiquitination or indirectly by regulating RHOA degradation, which in turn leads to defects in testis and
penile development and differentiation (AIM 2). Finally, we identify and characterize the mutations in KCTD13-
CUL3 pathway that are critical in GU development such that they could be used to generate a diagnostic kit for
patients with disorders of sexual development (AIM3). Completion of the studies in this proposal will advance
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie common GU birth defects."

The molecular characterization of sex-specific piRNA transcription and snRNA transcription in C. elegans.
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play key roles in repressing transposons in the germline. Loss of transposon-
targeting piRNAs can have sex-specific consequences leading to genomic instability and infertility. However, the
mechanisms of sex-specific piRNA expression remain largely unknown. Recent studies have revealed that
SNPC-4, a core factor required for snRNA transcription, is also essential for piRNA transcription in C. elegans
and suggests that the snRNA transcriptional machinery may have been co-opted to transcribe piRNAs.
Therefore, identifying the transcription factors and characterizing the specific protein domains that dictate sex-
specific piRNA and snRNA transcriptional specificity will address this critical knowledge gap. The small nuclear
RNA activating protein complex (SNAPc) is a conserved heterotrimeric complex consisting of SNAPC1,
SNAPC3, and SNAPC4 that facilitates snRNA transcription in mammals. Unlike mammals, C. elegans have
several orthologs of SNAPC1 that have sexually dimorphic roles in piRNA biogenesis. My preliminary data show
that SNPC-1.2 promotes female piRNA transcription while SNPC-1.3 is a known male piRNA transcription factor.
Furthermore, my initial data show the C. elegans SNAPC3 ortholog, SNPC-3.4, facilitates snRNA biogenesis,
while SNPC-3.1 and SNPC-3.2 act redundantly to drive both male and female piRNA expression. I will investigate
my hypothesis that SNPC-1.2 is a bona fide female piRNA transcription factor and harbors unique protein motifs
conferring female piRNA expression, while distinct domains in SNPC-1.3 specify male piRNA expression (Aim
1). Additionally, I predict SNPC-3.4 is a snRNA biogenesis factor, while SNPC-3.1 and SNPC-3.2 act redundantly
to drive piRNA transcription. Analogous to the SNPC1 family, I predict that distinct domains within SNPC-3.4
and SNPC-3.1/3.2 specify their recruitment and transcription at snRNA and piRNA genomic loci, respectively
(Aim 2). Collectively, these data will elucidate the snRNA and female and male piRNA transcriptional complexes
and identify the protein motifs that engender snRNA and sex-specific piRNA transcription. This work may have
implications in treating fertility defects that are due to abnormal piRNA expression as well as different neuronal
diseases associated with snRNA misregulation such as ALS."
10839631,"ABSTRACT / SUMMARY
Current HIV/STI prevention interventions for Black heterosexual / opposite-sex (BHOS) couples in the
US require an in-person modality and focus on specific subgroups (sero-doscordant, substance using). Digital
health interventions (DHIs) may provide one solution to expand access to tailored, couples-based HIV/STI
prevention-care interventions that appeal to a wide variety of Black heterosexual / opposite-sex (BHOS)
couples in the U.S. with varying vulnerabilities to HIV and other STIs.
 One couples-based DHI has reduced cisgender male couples’ susceptibility to HIV and other STIs. The
DHI used a hybrid format with individuals first completing a sequence of pre-determined modules (i.e., HIV/STI
education, instructional videos, a searchable sexual health resources database, activities including an
agreement builder) followed by completing the sequence jointly with their partner, and then ending with a
finalized, comprehensive sexual agreement containing HIV/STI prevention items. To examine the acceptability
of this theoretically-driven, couples-based DHI for HIV/STI prevention, we conducted a multi-method pilot
project with 28 BHOS couples in New York State. BHOS couples reported high intervention acceptability
(96%), and qualitative dyadic content and thematic analysis revealed explicit recommendations to enhance
intervention relevancy for adapting the DHI to meet their specific relationship and sexual health needs.
Given these preliminary findings, we propose to conduct a novel, 3-year mixed method study guided by
the Couples Interdependence Theory and the ADAPT-ITT model to adapt and pilot-test this DHI to meet the
needs of BHOS couples. Dyadic data will be collected via: a) quantitative assessments at baseline, month 3
and 6; b) HIV/STI screening at baseline and month 6; c) 7 different paradata outputs (intervention use); d)
individual exit interviews at month 6. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Adapt the intervention for BHOS couples
using the APAPT-ITT model with human-centered design. Aim 2: Conduct a 6-month pilot RCT with 60 BHOS
couples using a 2:2 block random allocation approach (intervention vs. 3-month, delayed control), stratified by
dyad HIV serostatus (i.e. serodiscordant, seroconcordant). Feasibility will measure enrollment and retention
rates. Acceptability will leverage mixed methods from 3 data sources: qualitative - to contextualize intervention
engagement; paradata - to describe intervention use over time; quantitative - to assess usability, sexual health
behavior and general wellness. Aim 3: Examine preliminary intervention impact: 1) primary outcomes (mutual
HIV/STI awareness; creation/adherence to a tailored relationship agreement, uptake/adherence of evidence-
based biomedical strategies); 2) secondary outcomes (Improvements in relationship dynamics including
communication). Impact will be assessed via couples’ outcomes over time, between trial arms, and for all
couples. This study has high public health significance complemented with rigor and scientific premise to
address a critical gap in couples-based interventions."

We propose to renew the NIEHS Training Program in Environmental Epidemiology. This program seeks to
prepare outstanding researchers in environmental epidemiology through rigorous training and research
methodology. Currently in its 40th year, this program is the cornerstone of support for students working in
environmental epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). We have graduated
over 200 professionals who are researchers, teachers, and consultants in environmental epidemiology and
related disciplines. Many hold leadership positions in academia, government, and the private sector. The
Program consists of two tracks: environmental epidemiology and environmental molecular epidemiology and
training for both tracks is offered at the pre- and postdoctoral levels. We leverage the rich academic
environment at HSPH, the Harvard teaching hospitals and other Harvard University schools such as the
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to provide numerous opportunities for cutting edge research in
environmental health. We have brought together outstanding multi-disciplinary faculty mentors to provide
integrated interdisciplinary experiences and have created a specialized curriculum providing a strong
background in environmental health, exposure assessment, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The track in
environmental molecular epidemiology offers additional coursework in molecular biology, genetics, epigenetics,
etc. and opportunities to conduct research in a laboratory setting. For this funding cycle we request 6 pre- and
6 postdoctoral trainees. The predoctoral students are part of the new multidisciplinary PhD program in
Population Health Sciences with a chosen field of study in environmental health or epidemiology. The PhD
program is structured to be completed in 4 years with the first 2 years involved in coursework. Research credits
are obtained through tutorials on current problems in epidemiology and from the completion of a doctoral thesis
of substance. Postdoctoral trainees are exposed to a wide variety of interdisciplinary and integrated intellectual
offerings, including didactic instruction, seminars, professional colloquia, meetings, and academic
collaboration. Significant independent research for the postdoctoral fellows varies in duration depending on the
scope of work, but usually is between 2 to 3 years. All trainees complete individual candidate training plans
and there is ongoing evaluation of the Program. This program will continue a long history of excellence in
training successful researchers in the field of environmental epidemiology at Harvard University and in
furthering the mission of NIEHS."

 This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award describes a five-year
research and training program to establish the principal investigator (PI) as an independent, R01-funded
physician-scientist in the field of pulmonary vascular medicine. Co-mentorship by Bradley Maron, M.D., an
expert in cysteinyl thiol biochemistry, vascular fibrosis, and PAH pathobiology and pathophysiology, and Joseph
Loscalzo, M.D., Ph.D., an expert in redox biochemistry, network medicine, and proteomics, will oversee the PI’s
research and professional development activities at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical
School. Scientific publication, guidance from an advisory committee, didactic education, and presentation at
scientific conferences will support the scientific aims of the project and provide career development in three key
training areas: the pathobiology of PAH inception, kinase ubiquitination, and experimental PAH models. The PI
is guaranteed >80% protected academic time to dedicate to the proposed K08 program.
 PAH is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and oxidant stress that promotes fibrotic remodeling of
the pulmonary arterioles, leading to right heart failure, and death. Mortality and hospitalization increase
incrementally beginning at a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) below values that were previously thought
to be pathogenic. Therefore, treatment of early-stage PAH may improve clinical outcome, but effective therapies
do not exist because the pathobiology of endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in early PAH is not
known. We provide novel data that early-stage PAH is characterized by pulmonary arteriolar fibrosis, impaired
right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling, and increased endothelial C-terminal src kinase (Csk)
expression occurring prior to the development of elevated mPAP in vivo. Computational modeling predicts that
the Csk binding-partner and E3 ubiquitin ligase Casitas b-lineage proto-oncogene (Cbl) is susceptible to
oxidative modification at cysteinyl thiol 396 (Cys396). We hypothesize that oxidation of endothelial Cbl-Cys396
prevents Csk ubiquitination to increase Csk-dependent fibrosis and impair RV-PA coupling in early-stage PAH.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of Cbl-Cys396 oxidation
on Csk ubiquitination and expression in cultured human PAECs, 2) Assess the role of increased endothelial Csk
on fibrillar collagen expression in cultured human PAECs, and 3) Test the effect of Csk inhibition on RV-PA
coupling in early- and advanced-stage PAH in vivo. We anticipate that findings from this K08 will establish Csk-
targeted therapy as a novel strategy by which to prevent or reverse endothelial fibrosis and vascular remodeling
prior to the development of elevated mPAP and right heart failure in PAH. Furthermore, this research program
will establish kinase-ubiquitin ligase dysregulation in early-stage PAH as a plane of separation from the PI’s
current co-mentors."
10842358,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
In a large-scale nuclear event, many people could be exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation (IR). This can
have long-term adverse effects on immune function, putting victims at risk for immune disorders and contributing
to the dysfunction of organs that depend on a functional immune system. Currently no FDA-approved drugs are
available to mitigate immune dysregulation in radiation victims. The overall objectives of this project are to
understand how platelets contribute to immune dysregulation after exposure to IR and to test platelet-centric
countermeasures to mitigate IR-induced immune dysregulation and organ damage (specifically in the intestine
and heart). Platelets can regulate immune function by binding directly to immune cells or by delivering submicron
platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) to the cells. In every healthy individual, platelets form platelet–leukocyte
aggregates and generate PMPs in the circulation under normal conditions, but these activities increase under
pathological conditions. Various platelet receptors interact with their specific counter receptors on leukocytes,
specifically polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and monocytes—2 crucial members of the innate immune
system that can modify the adaptive immune response—to form platelet–leukocyte aggregates. Central to this
interaction is platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) binding to leukocyte Mac-1, resulting in activation of both platelets
and leukocytes. PMPs can activate PMNs and monocytes by delivering cytokines, growth factors, and RNA.
Notably, proteolytic cleavage of platelet GPVI is an essential step for PMP generation. Our preliminary data show
that mice with dysfunctional GPIbα (cannot bind Mac-1) exhibit increased inflammation, intestinal injury, PMP
generation, and lethality following a single dose of 8.5 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) compared to wild-type mice.
Moreover, we showed that mice with dysfunctional GPIbα are more prone to inflammation following polymicrobial
sepsis, which can occur after IR exposure. Finally, GPVI-KO mice generate fewer PMPs and exhibit reduced
plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to mice with dysfunctional GPIbα after 8.5 Gy TBI. We
hypothesize that lack of GPIbα–Mac-1 interaction and enhanced PMP generation contribute to IR-induced
immune dysregulation and predict that administering exogenous GPIbα or limiting PMP generation will mitigate
IR-induced immune dysregulation and organ damage. The studies outlined in this proposal will: 1) Determine
whether selective blocking of GPIbα binding to Mac-1 exacerbates, while exogenous GPIbα administration
mitigates, TBI-induced immune dysregulation and 2) Evaluate whether limiting PMP generation by inhibiting
GPVI mitigates TBI-induced immune dysregulation. Our studies will provide insight into the previously
unexplored role of platelet–leukocyte interaction and PMP generation in modulating IR-induced immune
dysregulation. Most importantly, the findings will help to develop novel radiation mitigators."
10842359,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of obesity and its complications, including diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
are a significant health care crisis. These complication impact liver metabolism by dysregulating
gluconeogenesis, lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and fat oxidation. NAFLD is improved by lifestyle
interventions. Ironically, physical activity, exercise, and aerobic capacity affect many of these pathways similarly,
but profoundly lower liver fat independent of weight loss. Hence, aerobic exercise is commonly prescribed
therapy for NAFLD. One route by which obesity or exercise influence regulation of liver metabolism may be by
signals through the sympathetic nervous system. The overarching goal of this 5-year research career
development plan is to facilitate my transition from a technically focused researcher to a fully independent
academic scientist investigating the in vivo physiology of disease. This will be accomplished by training in
disciplines of physiology, neurophysiology, and exercise that will be used to identify mechanisms by which
hepatic sympathetic nervous signaling controls liver metabolic flux during obesity and interventions. Elevated
basal sympathetic signaling is thought to occur through the α1b adrenergic receptor (AR), which is highly
expressed in mouse liver (including hepatocytes) and has been suggested to stimulate hepatic glucose
production, breakdown of glycogen, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ketogenesis. This
project focuses on understanding how hepatic α1b-AR contributes to dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis and
fat oxidation during obesity and NAFLD (Aim 1), and the degree to which liver α1b-AR mediates beneficial effects
of acute (Aim 2) or chronic exercise (Aim 3) as treatments of NAFLD. Using targeted metabolomics and stable
isotope infusions, I will quantitatively evaluate how AR signaling regulates liver metabolism. The findings will
advance our knowledge of how metabolism is altered by complications of obesity and provide a novel training
platform for the recipient."

portfolio, new inpatient and outpatient capacity, and robust collaboration with community stakeholders, our Hub
is positioned to profoundly impact the science of translation and public health in our region and beyond. Two
formative and synergistic themes guide our Hub’s strategy for the next funding cycle. The first, “From Lab to
Life,” was developed by our community partners at the inaugural CTSA funding in 2010 and reflects the
seminal and ongoing NCATS’s focus on nurturing the kernels of translational science that can be found in
virtually all clinical research. We will catalyze a wide range of basic and applied innovations enabled by unique
UCI and community talent, such as: 1) transforming clinical trials in rare diseases, 2) reimagining cell-based
diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for a broad spectrum of health conditions, and 3) reconceptualizing the
practice of neurorehabilitation through AI-based mechanistic use of haptic robotics. Our second theme, “From
Hub to Health,” embraces NCATS’s and our Hub’s burgeoning focus and expertise on dissemination and
implementation, on diversity and inclusive excellence, and on harnessing the science of translation to mitigate
health disparities and inequities. In preparing “From Hub to Health” objectives, we worked closely with the
Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA), our county public health department, which serves more than
3.2M people, a diverse population and a microcosm of healthcare needs, inequities, and disparities seen
across the U.S. The Healthy School Restart Program pioneered data-driven policy guidance for community
schools during the pandemic and blossomed into a formal Hub-OCHCA collaboration. “From Hub to Health”
projects for the next funding cycle are wide ranging and include: 1) the request from OCHCA for the Hub to
serve as the translational science collaborator for the community-wide OC System of Care Think Tank to
reduce health care disparities and inequities in our region, 2) expanding our Hub Medical Student Research
Program to achieve unprecedented gains in URM participation in translational science, 3) leading a novel,
nationally funded program to train a community-based workforce in population-health informatics and data
science, and 4) re-envisioning design of investigator-initiated clinical trials by developing, demonstrating, and
disseminating our program of Quality-by-Design Studios. Our partnerships with UCI-affiliated Children’s
Hospital of Orange County and the Long Beach Veterans Administration ensure that these essential
populations will be well represented in all Hub activities. The Hub will support these projects by careful
allocation of resource modules, training opportunities, and continuous quality improvement with a vigorous
application of the translational science benefits model. In sum, we are positioned to promote “more treatments
for all people more quickly,” the translational science goal that has guided our Hub since 2010."

of the projects but will further participate in experimental design, prioritization of resources, and the
interpretation of data. In addition, Core C will identify additional areas for collaboration across all projects as
the program matures and thus be central to the interactive environment and comprehensive analysis of the
overall platform as data is generated. The core is a critical aspect to the success of the overall program
because it will provide dedicated and highly specialized services to all projects. Perhaps most importantly the

10844393,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US
and worldwide. Non-invasive imaging provides valuable information to assess differential
diagnosis and guide management. However, there is a gap in academically-oriented CV
imaging training programs that are able to train specialists with the knowledge base,
experience, research tools, analytical and leadership skills to fully develop, apply, and evaluate
the increasingly complex gamut of CV imaging possibilities. This is the second competing
renewal application for this T32 program. This program offers post-doctoral research training for
individuals with an MD, or combined MD/PhD degrees, who have completed clinical training in
cardiology, radiology, or CV imaging who are committed to pursuing an academic career in CV
imaging science. Our goal is to continue to provide outstanding opportunities for multi-
disciplinary research training for clinician-scientists in CV imaging with the clinical and
investigative skills to establish independent careers, mentor others, and lead their own
programs. Since initial funding in 2010, we have graduated 16 post-doctoral fellows. Key
indicators of the effectiveness of this young program include: (1) 15/16 graduates remain
involved in academic medicine and science, and one is completing additional clinical training;
(2) 8/10 fellows who completed the program 2 years ago have received peer reviewed funding
by NIH, VA, or ACC. Of the 6 graduates from the last 2 years, one received an ACC mentored
award, one received grant funding from the Radiological Society of North America, and one just
submitted a K award; (3) the grant has sponsored 133 unique publications in top peer review
journals; (4) 50% of our graduates hold leadership roles in their respective imaging programs,
and 38% have prominent leadership roles in professional organizations and others. Our
mentors are primarily comprised of cardiologists and radiologists, but also include faculty from
disciplines outside CV imaging including clinical and basic scientists. All the mentors have a
strong track record of research collaborations. We offer research training opportunities in 8
thematic areas: (1) molecular imaging, (2) myocardial structure, function, and metabolism, (3)
genetics, (4) pulmonary hypertension, (5) outcomes research, (6) ischemic heart disease, (7)
women's health, (8) radiomics and artificial intelligence. The proposed program supports 3

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease affecting
young adults, often resulting in irreversible neurological dysfunction. B lymphocytes play a complex and critical
role in MS pathology and are the target of several therapeutics in clinical trials. While monoclonal antibodies
targeting the B cell surface marker CD20 (i.e. Rituximab, Ocrelizumab) dramatically reduce the annualized
relapse rate and delay disability progression, not all patients respond, likely due to the heterogenous nature of
MS. Currently, there is no approved technique to noninvasively visualize B cells in the CNS in order to select MS
patients for anti-B cell therapies and monitor treatment responses. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
has enormous potential to fill these gaps by providing highly specific, quantitative information by tracking B cells.
Notably, PET tracers targeting CD19 and/or CD20 markers could reveal dynamic information on the
pathophysiology of a wide range of B cells, ultimately enabling quantification of therapeutic effects on B cell load
in the CNS and peripheral organs in real time. To date, only one PET tracer for CD20+ B cells has undergone
preliminary evaluation in MS, and no PET tracers have been developed for imaging CD19, expressed on a
broader range of B cells (including suspected pathogenic antibody-secreting plasmablasts and circulating
plasma cells). Here, we propose to develop novel immuno-PET tracers based on clinically approved CD19 and
CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Such PET tracers could undergo relatively rapid clinical translation and
have immediate impact on patient stratification, dosing, and real-time therapy monitoring. Our hypothesis is that
CD19 and CD20-targeted PET tracers will enable non-invasive, sensitive, and specific detection of various B cell
subsets in the CNS and periphery, in the context of MS. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of B
cell specific PET imaging with [64Cu]Rituximab, which enabled in vivo detection and quantification of B cells in
CNS and peripheral tissues in a murine model of MS, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE). In this proposal, we will build on our published data in addition to developing the first reported human
CD19-PET tracer. We will achieve our goals through the following specific aims: 1) Develop immuno-PET tracers
for imaging different B cell-subsets, 2) Assess biological effects of CD19 and CD20 imaging agents in cells and
mice, and 3) Evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of CD19/CD20 PET tracers for detecting B cells in the CNS
and periphery of MS mouse models in addition to their ability to predict treatment response. Completing these
experiments will provide invaluable information regarding which B cell PET tracers appear most promising for
clinical translation while also shedding light on the in vivo pathophysiology of B cells in MS in the brain and
beyond. This proposal addresses a significant unmet clinical need and our unique approach has high potential
to impact the way we study, monitor, and treat MS."

 Food allergy is mediated by antigen crosslinking of IgE antibodies bound to mast cells (MC) and is often
associated with intestinal dysbiosis. IgE sensitization to food is not by itself sufficient to drive food anaphylaxis.
Intestinal MC load, which controls intestinal permeability and systemic antigen absorption, is an important
determinant. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor, DOCK8, is important for STAT3 activation, IL-22, and IL-
17 production. As food allergy and anaphylaxis are cardinal features of DOCK8 deficient patients, DOCK8
deficiency offers an attractive disease model for identifying mechanisms underlying food allergy.
 We find elevated serum tryptase levels in DOCK8 deficient patients. Dock8-/- mice exhibit exaggerated IgE-
mediated anaphylaxis to oral, but not i.p. antigen challenge, as well as intestinal MC expansion, which we show
is neither a consequence of a cell intrinsic DOCK8 deficiency within MCs, nor dependent on IgE. Mice with
selective deficiency in DOCK8 in T cells phenocopy Dock8-/- mice, and both exhibit similar intestinal dysbiosis T
cells in the small intestine (SI) lamina propria (LP) of Dock8-/- mice have decreased expression of Il22 and Il17
and increased expression of Il4 and Il13. DOCK8 deficient SI epithelium has decreased expression of
antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, but increased numbers of tuft cells and elevated Il25 expression. Treatment
with either sIL-22 or an oral antibiotic cocktail normalizes intestinal MC expansion, suggesting a critical role for
dysbiosis driven by type 17 cytokine deficiency. IL-25 and IL-4 blockade reduce intestinal MC load and passive
oral anaphylaxis in Dock8-/- mice, suggesting a critical role for IL-25, which promotes type 2 cytokine production
by ILC2s and Th2 cells, and for IL-4, which acts on MCs. Importantly, germ free (GF) WT recipients of fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) from conventionally raised Dock8-/- mice have significantly greater intestinal
MC load compared to GF WT recipients of FMT from conventionally raised WT controls. Thus, our proposed
studies investigate the mechanisms by which dysbiosis in DOCK8 deficiency may increase intestinal MC load
and thereby promote anaphylaxis are relevant to patients with classic food allergy.
 We will test the hypotheses that 1) reduced production of type 17 cytokines due to defective
STAT3 activation in DOCK8 deficiency results in intestinal dysbiosis, 2) dysbiosis causes intestinal tuft
cells to produce IL-25, which drives type 2 cytokine production by ILC2s and Th2 cells, and 3) IL-4, in
turn, drives intestinal MC expansion and activation, thereby promoting anaphylaxis to ingested antigen.
We will make use of transgenic mice and take advantage of our access to DOCK8 deficient patients and
previously well-characterized fecal samples from children with classic food allergy to test our hypotheses.
 The proposed studies will delineate how immune mechanisms important for maintaining the intestinal
microbiome regulate intestinal MC expansion and activation, and thereby the severity of food allergy, thus
identifying novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of food allergy."

This application seeks support for UVA's Biotechnology Training Program (BTP). The BTP is a highly interactive,
multidisciplinary and >50% diverse community of PhD trainees drawn selectively from an annual May competition
open to PhD students from all science and engineering departments university-wide for which we request 10
predoctoral slots. Trainee funding is for 2 years. Our emphasis is on scientific rigor and communication using
the latest tools available with award winning and collaborative dual mentoring giving rise to a breadth of
multidisciplinary and academic/industrial training unmatched at UVA. Our advocacy for trainee exposure to a
wide variety of careers has been transformational - most importantly for trainees but also for the university with
which we share many of our offerings. We believe in trainee career preparedness that is personalized, evolving
and built on trust, and that relationships do not necessarily end at graduation. Indeed, our graduates welcome
the opportunity to return as BTP seminar or industrial panel speakers with talks focused on, or interlaced with,
career reflections; or to help in a trainee advisory/advocate role as members of the BTP Board of Corporate
Advisors. They are the ultimate measure of our success. Their outcomes are updated at least quarterly on our
grads web page with information drawn from LinkedIn. BTP students in training (21, including 11 minorities) or
graduated (65) entered with an average undergraduate GPA of 3.7, are currently hosted by 8 different
departments. BTP trainees and graduates have received multiple awards, experienced 73 different externships
from 51 different companies, and after graduation are now employed in industry (37), academia (15; including
an HBCU Dean), government (3), medicine (3), or foundation (2). Since '05, 164 first author articles have been
published in journals with impact factors as high as 24. Trainees develop leadership and teamwork skills by
taking direct responsibility for programmatic features of the BTP including: BTP Symposia and Seminars, BTP
Day of Caring, BTP Industrial Q&A Panels and BTP company tours. Mentoring our trainees is a highly engaged,
collaborative and well-funded faculty of 55 individuals from 14 departments. Institutional support has been
essential for our success, including Vice President for Research help with externship and Symposia funding, and
an additional training slot funded by the School of Engineering. Our overall goal is to develop the next generation
of exceptionally rigorous, creative, talented and diverse scientists who are socialized in biotechnology themes
and practiced in teamwork. Our aims are to: (1) cement a foundation of rigor in experimental planning, data
organization and transparency built on the Nature and eLife recognized 'Open Science Framework' in a
collaboration with Charlottesville's 'Center for Open Science', (2) to energetically nurture our trainees love and
inquisitiveness for science as they acquire new skills to solve important scientific problems, and (3) to overlay
this training with various forms of biotechnology exposure, including required externships – all coupled with a
strong and constant commitment to trainee diversity."
10844526,"Project Summary
 Couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) for male couples in the US has emerged as a promising
dyadic HIV prevention strategy. Interventions such as CHTC, which address HIV-risk within primary
relationships, are an essential component to a comprehensive national prevention strategy. Up to two-thirds of
HIV infections among MSM occur within the context of primary partnerships. Rates are particularly pronounced
for emerging adult MSM (aged 18-29). Estimates suggest 79% to 84% of HIV infections are transmitted by
primary partners5.
 The current CHTC protocol is limited in two ways. First, CHTC does not incorporate a focus on drug use –
a well-established correlate of HIV infection risk among YMSM specifically. Second, CHTC provides limited
guidance for formal communication skills training in instances where partners have substantial communication
deficits. To address these limitations, our group has developed and pilot-tested the We Test intervention, which
includes two adjunct CHTC components. The first is a substance use module (SUM) that elicits the formation
of a substance use agreement and a discussion about how partners can support one another in observing drug
use limits. The second is an assertive communication training video (ACTV). Results from our recent pilot RCT
(DA036419, PI-Starks) suggest these components decrease the odds of drug use and drug-related problems.
 We now propose a multi-site trial powered to test the efficacy of We Test’s components and evaluate
putative moderators and mediators. The proposed RCT builds directly upon the pilot data generated by
DA036419. Participants include 240 male couples in which at least one partner is age 18 – 29; HIV negative;
and reports recent (past 30 days) drug use; and recent (past 3 months) sexual HIV/STI transmission risk
behavior. The study utilizes biological markers for drug use (fingernail assay), HIV testing, and gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and syphilis. Viral load testing is conducted with HIV positive participants. To increase
generalizability and the feasibility of recruitment, couples be enrolled equally across 2-sites in New York City
and Detroit. Participants will be randomized in a factorial design to receive CHTC as usual; CHTC + SUM;
CHTC + ACTV; or CHTC+SUM+ACTV. Follow-ups will occur at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post intervention.
 Drs. Starks, Stephenson (Co-I), Kahle (Co-I; biostatistician) and Sullivan (Consultant) have substantial
experience in the study of male couples. This group completed the pilot RCT which produced the formative
data for this proposal. The study is supported by the Emory CFAR Prevention Sciences Core and the Clinical
Virology Research Laboratory. The intervention tested is an innovative and highly scalable adaptation of the
existing CHTC intervention. In addition, the integration of a substance use intervention into CHTC might
facilitate uptake by affording access to additional funding sources and expanding the pool of providers who see
the service as relevant. Results would inform the development of a future implementation/effectiveness trial.

10844679,"The current COVID-19 crisis starkly illustrates the need to develop new modalities for the
therapeutic treatment of pathogenic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, including against
novel viruses that have yet to emerge. Human oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) has recently
been determined to be a critical mediator in the replication of a broad spectrum of ssRNA viral
human pathogens, including the enteroviruses, rhinovirus, hepatitis C, Zika virus, Dengue fever
viruses, and coronaviruses. OSBP is an ER-located, non-enzymatic protein reported to function
as an important lipid sensor and lipid transporter in eukaryotic cells. Published research, including
our own recent publications, has established the antiviral activity of structurally-diverse OSBP-
targeting small molecules against multiple RNA pathogenic viruses. These discoveries present
the opportunity for a paradigm shift in antiviral drug development: potentially drug targeting a
human host protein, OSBP, that is required for viral proliferation of a broad-spectrum of RNA
viruses, as opposed to targeting viral proteins present in individual viruses. We have discovered
that transient, low dose treatment with the OSBP-targeting compound OSW-1-compound induces
a longterm, multigenerational repression of OSBP, and the cells with repressed OSBP show a
pronounced inhibition of ssRNA viral replication. Our preliminary results show that the OSW-1-
compound has prophylactic antiviral activity at low nanomolar concentrations against several
ssRNA viruses, including against one coronavirus tested. The longterm repression of OSBP,
triggered by OSW-1, has no effect on cellular division, viability, or morphology.
 The purpose of this proposal is to understand the cellular role of OSBP in innate antiviral
response. Our preliminary results show that OSBP: 1) regulates mTORC1 activity, 2) induces
autophagy; 3) slows global protein translation; and 4) activates alternative splicing nonsense-
mediated decay (AS-NMD) process, which is an RNA regulatory process. All of these OSBP-
involved cellular processes would limit ssRNA viral replication individually, but there is little insight
into the organization of these systems to establish a coordinated antiviral response.Our overall
hypothesis is that OSBP serves in a major regulatory role to coordinate a multifaceted innate
antiviral response to ssRNA infection. We propose a complete model of how OSBP senses early-
stage viral infection and then triggers a multisystem response to block viral replication in cells,
including through modulating mTOR1C activity and the AS-NMD system."

 The studies in the proposal are focused on the neuromotor system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and natural
aging. Increased age is associated with muscle atrophy and weakness (sarcopenia) and is a significant predictor
of chronic disease and mortality in the elderly. Aging is a major risk factor for conditions such as AD and
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In the elderly population, pneumonia incidence is 3-times higher than in younger
age groups, with AD further increasing the incidence and severity of airway infections. The incidence of airway
infection in aging and age-associated disorders is undoubtedly related to sarcopenia of the diaphragm muscles
(DIAm) and discoordination of airway protective manoeuvres, which involve both DIAm and an assortment of
other respiratory-associated muscles including individual tongue, chest wall and abdominal muscles. This
proposal leverages the extensive experience of the PI in both respiratory neuromotor systems and
neurodegeneration. Previously, we found that DIAm sarcopenia was related to a loss of larger phrenic motor
neurons (MNs) and subsequent denervation, consistent with motor unit specific effects on maximum
transdiaphragmatic pressure generation. Our preliminary observations in both intrinsic and extrinsic tongue and
external abdominal oblique muscles also suggest sarcopenia in tongue may also be due to denervation.
 Despite the cause of age-related MN loss being unknown, clues from neurodegenerative conditions that
affect MNs suggest that synaptic loss and mitochondrial disfunctions contribute to MN death, with
disproportionate effects on larger MNs. The major conceptual advancement in this proposal is to
comprehensively evaluate the entire motor unit: hypoglossal, thoracic and phrenic MNs – recruited to perform
motor tasks; neuromuscular junctions; and tongue, chest, abdominal and DIAm muscles. We hypothesize that
in old age and AD, motor impairments and loss of larger MNs (denervation) of respiratory muscles is underpinned
by MN and NMJ synapse loss and mitochondrial dysfunction (reduced volume density, fragmentation, and
activity). In addition, we will trial two approaches to ameliorate the contribution of synaptic loss (via SPG302) or
mitochondrial dysfunction (via edaravone) to MN death in AD and aging.
 The proposed studies employ an array of innovative techniques, with assessments ranging from sub-cellular
through to system level behavior in Fischer 344 rats and in an AD model (TgF344-AD) on the same genetic
background. In Aim 1, we will assess excitatory and inhibitory synapse loss, dendritic and dendritic spine loss,
and survival of hypoglossal, thoracic and phrenic MNs. Additionally, we will evaluate denervation, sarcopenia
and functional impairments in tongue, chest, abdominal and DIAm muscles across aging and AD. In Aim 2, we
will assess mitochondrial volume density (MVD), fragmentation and function (SDHmax) in respiratory MNs and in
muscles in aging and AD. In Aim 3, we will assess whether mitigating synaptic dysfunction (by SPG302) and/or
mitochondrial dysfunction (by edaravone) improves outcomes in respiratory MNs and muscles in aging and AD."
10829262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spatial navigation is a fundamental human behavior, and deficits in navigational functions are among the
hallmark symptoms of severe neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding how the
human brain processes and encodes spatial information is thus of critical importance for the development of
therapies for affected patients. Previous studies have shown that the brain forms neural representations of spatial
information, via spatially-tuned activity of single neurons (e.g., place cells, grid cells, or head direction cells), and
by the coordinated oscillatory activity of cell populations. The vast majority of these studies have focused on the
encoding of self-related spatial information, such as one’s own location, orientation, and movements. However,
everyday tasks in social settings require the encoding of spatial information not only for oneself, but also for other
people in the environment. At present, it is largely unknown how the human brain accomplishes this important
function, and how aspects of human cognition may affect these spatial encoding mechanisms. This project
therefore aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms that underlie the encoding of spatial information and
awareness of others. Specifically, the proposed research plan will determine how human deep brain oscillations
and single-neuron activity allow us to keep track of other individuals as they move through our environment.
Next, the project will determine whether these spatial encoding mechanisms are specific to the encoding of
another person, or whether they can be used more flexibly to support the encoding of moving inanimate objects
and even more abstract cognitive functions such as imagined navigation. Finally, the project will determine how
spatial information is encoded in more complex real-world scenarios, when multiple information sources (e.g.,
multiple people) are present. To address these questions, intracranial medial temporal lobe activity will be
recorded from two rare participant groups: (1) Participants with permanently implanted depth electrodes for the
treatment of focal epilepsy through responsive neurostimulation (RNS), who provide a unique opportunity to
record deep brain oscillations during free movement and naturalistic behavior; and (2) hospitalized epilepsy
patients with temporarily implanted intracranial electrodes in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), from whom joint
oscillatory and single-neuron activity can be recorded.
In addition, this award will allow me to complete a multifaceted career development plan: Since my current
experience with electrophysiological recordings is limited to oscillatory activity from RNS participants, I will learn
to record and analyze human single-neuron activity from EMU patients in a clinical setting. My training will be
guided by pioneers in this research area, and will take place at UCLA, one of the world’s leading institutions in
the clinical and research work with these patient populations. I will further attend seminars, coursework, and
conferences, to develop not only as an experimentalist, but also as an independent leader and science
communicator. Together, this will provide me with the necessary set of skills for my transition to independence."

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors. While typically of benign histology, they can be
associated with significant neurological morbidity and have the potential for malignant transformation. In our
previous studies, we completed genomic analysis of over 700 meningiomas using whole exome and targeted
next-generation sequencing, identifying driver mutations in 12 genes and establishing mutually exclusive
molecular subgroups. We now propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of
TRAF7-dependent meningiomas (which represent up to one quarter of all meningiomas), undertake
molecular genomic analyses to identify somatic coding and non-coding or genomic events in TRAF7 tumors
that progress to higher grades. We also propose to test and validate candidate drug efficacy using primary
cultures from surgically resected meningiomas carrying TRAF7 aberrations, as well as mouse models of
meningioma that we have established."
10863656,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CORE C
Bunyaviruses and Picornaviruses are RNA viruses that cause outbreaks of human disease. Given their diversity
and mechanisms of transmission, they represent potential pathogens of pandemic potential. The major goal of
our Bunyavirus and Picornavirus ReVAMPP (BP4) Center is to establish optimized design technologies for
vaccines and antibody therapeutics based on prototype bunyaviruses and picornaviruses that can be readily
applied to newly emerging threats. Research in our Structure Core C will use structural biology, computational
biology, and biophysics approaches to support the Projects and Cores of this consortium. The ability to probe
antigen-antibody interactions at a molecular level using these tools provides insight into the specificity and affinity
of antigen-antibody interactions and guides iterative redesign of the antigen in collaboration with the Projects
and Cores. Thus, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of antibody-antigen
complexes will be determined and characterized. Core C will provide the expertise that could be used to engineer
antigen reagents to elicit and evaluate the optimal protective immune response against target immunogens.
Core C activities will be conducted in two physical sites with complementary expertise and physical assets, with
the Purdue site supporting Projects 1-2 on picornaviruses and the VUMC site supporting Projects 3-5 on
hantaviruses and arenaviruses. The two sites already have a long-standing collaborative relationship and will
share expertise, technology, and reagents. Core C will work closely with each Project Leader and other Core
research teams to ensure exchange data and analyses to guide the efficient scientific development of consortium
goals. The Core will manage data deposition of structural data on behalf of the Projects to the Protein Data Bank
(PDB), Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB), the NIH Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource
(IEDB) and related public access databases."
10863657,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CORE D
The Vaccine and Therapeutics Technologies (VTT) Core will focus on developing a rapid pipeline for next-
generation vaccine and therapeutic antibody candidates. We will facilitate this by providing critical reagents,
consulting, and coordinating production and quality control of candidate molecules in myriad technology
platforms. This Core D will support all five Research Projects (RPs). The core group has five specific aims:
 (Aim 1) Develop and produce recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) as Picornavirus vaccine
candidates, supplied by Aleph Bio for Research Project 1 (RP1). (Aim 2) Design, production, purification,
modification, and quality control services for RNA lipid nanoparticles (RNA-LNPs) and rhesus adenoviral
(RhAd) vector vaccine platforms for RP1, RP3, and RP5. (Aim 3) Design, production, purification, modification,
and quality control services for circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine platforms for RP1, RP3, and RP5. (Aim 4)
Bolster the BP4 center network by offering the design and production of electroporation-delivered DNA-
encoded monoclonal antibodies for RP2, RP4, and RP5. (Aim 5) Provide access to design and broad
production capabilities for recombinant proteins and antibodies for all RPs.
 The VTT Core will prioritize the utilization of vaccine and antibody candidate molecule generation
services by aligning with the goals of the BP4 consortium, which aims to develop and deploy next-generation
vaccine and therapeutic antibody candidates rapidly. This prioritization will occur through the core group
consulting all Research Projects (RPs) about each delivery technology's strengths, weaknesses, and overall
capabilities. This approach will help researchers make informed decisions about which technologies are most
suitable for their specific projects. The core leaders also will coordinate with the RP Proejct Leaders and
technology providers to ensure that the most promising candidates are produced and tested efficiently. The
core then will carry out production of the selected candidate molecules and perform extensive quality control
(QC) testing of the resulting reagents. This work will involve working closely with relevant working groups
across several organizations within the BP4 consortium. The VTT Core will ensure that the entire process,
from candidate molecule generation to QC, is carried out rapidly and with high quality standards. By focusing
on these objectives, the VTT Core will help prioritize candidate vaccines and antibodies in line with the
consortium's goals, ensuring that the most promising candidates are advanced efficiently through the
development pipeline."
10863658,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE E
Virologic and Immunologic Sample Acquisition Core (VISAC)
Preparedness for the next pandemic relies upon improved understanding of both emerging viruses and the
human immunologic response to these pathogens. Identification of immunogens and evaluation of T and B cell
repertoires from a diverse population is key to development of successful vaccine candidates and monoclonal
antibody therapeutics. These efforts require the collection of specialized immunologic specimens from people
exposed to pathogens of interest, in addition to isolation of the pathogen itself. The VISAC Core will support
all five Research Projects. Characterizing the host response to a prototype virus from a given viral family can
elucidate broadly applicable mechanisms by which the human immune response can be primed to protect
against other emerging viruses related to the prototype pathogen through vaccination, or protection can be
passively conveyed through the selection and administration of highly effective cross-neutralizing antibodies.
The creation of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens with pandemic potential relies on identifying
immune correlates, and evaluating the durability, of protection of the systemic and mucosal immune response.
Led by Drs. Kevin Messacar (VISAC Scientific PL) and David Kimberlin (VISAC Operational PL), the NIH-
funded “Pandemic Response Repository: Microbial and Immunologic Surveillance and Epidemiology,” or
PREMISE, pilot study has demonstrated proof-of-principle for the feasibility and utility of creating immunologic
biorepositories to drive development of vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody therapeutics for emerging
pathogens. The approach used in PREMISE, which will be applied in the Virologic and Immunologic Sample
Acquisition Core (VISAC), involves the creation of overlapping longitudinal cohorts of children from regions
likely to experience primary infection with a pathogen. The VISAC will expand the geographic scope of
PREMISE significantly to provide a unique biorepository of specialized biological specimens from people
exposed to prototype pathogens of interest to support the BP4 Center’s, as well as other ReVAMPP centers’,
basic and translational science work. This biorepository will consist of human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, serum, plasma, and crevicular fluid from diverse longitudinal cohorts of people from geographic regions
across three continents likely to be exposed to the selected viruses, as well as ongoing sampling of
contemporary strains of selected viruses through detection of viral shedding during symptomatic illness to
ensure the prototype pathogen approaches pursued apply to newly or more recently circulating viral strains."

Design and testing of picornavirus vaccine candidates
The need for effective vaccines against enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cannot be overstated. Given the ever-
increasing threat of these viral infections and their associated health impacts, it is crucial to develop a general
platform for rapid vaccine development. With this medical need in mind, here we propose to create such a
platform, one that can be easily and quickly adapted to different strains of the viruses as they emerge. We
envision a system that combines the latest tools and technologies, including new developments in molecular
biology, immunology, and vaccine design, to accelerate the discovery and development of new candidate
vaccines. By doing so, we mill make meaningful contributions towards protecting global populations from the
devastating effects of these viruses.
Our general approach is to design immunogens that will provide effective protection against these viruses,
incorporating information about sites of vulnerability for protective human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
(discovered in Research Project 2, focused on human mAbs). This effort is a crucial undertaking, as the five
human pathogens prototypes on which we will focus - Rhinovirus C, Enteroviruses A71 and D68, Coxsackievirus
B3 and Echovirus 11, are among the most medically significant viruses causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
nervous system diseases on a global scale. The innovative candidate vaccine platforms we will deploy are
designed with multiple technical advances, especially structurally-stabilized virus-like particles (VLPs) that
can be used as protein- or nucleic-acid-based immunogens. By leveraging the knowledge the BP4 consortium
obtains from detailed structure-function studies of protective human monoclonal antibodies, we can develop new
candidate vaccines that induce protection from pathogenic picornaviruses and reduce the risk of dangerous
outbreaks. In addition, we will combine these immunogens with a self-replicative RNA-based mucosal adjuvant.
This novel adjuvant mimics the effects of virus infection and triggers innate local immune responses, ensuring
robust T-cell and B-cell adaptive immune responses and long-lasting protection. By generating both systemic
and mucosal immune responses, we aim to create a robust defense against these viruses.
In the context of these studies, we will also develop new animal models to optimize testing of novel vaccination
strategies and to examine the immunogenicity and protection elicited by our candidate vaccines. The lead
vaccines will be advanced with an extensive network of industry and non-profit partners."
10863660,"PROJECT SUMMARY - RP2
Picornaviruses are an ever-present threat to human health, causing myriad diseases ranging from mild
(common colds, hand, foot, and mouth disease) to more severe (meningitis, acute flaccid myelitis, myocarditis,
and neonatal sepsis). Fortunately, one of the most successful vaccine programs in history targeted
picornaviruses; the poliovirus vaccines completely eradicated two of three types and nearly eliminated the
third. Learning from this experience, neutralizing antibodies in the sera of vaccinees are a well-established
correlate of protection against paralytic poliomyelitis. Therefore, to prepare for a possible picornavirus
pandemic in the future, we must have tools in place to comprehensively analyze the antibody response to an
emerging pathogen to inform adaptable and streamlined picornavirus vaccine platforms. To accomplish those
goals, we have assembled a team of experts in picornaviruses and human antibodies with an established
record of collaboration. We will focus our studies on four prototype picornaviruses with antigenic diversity and
different sites of infection: respiratory (enterovirus D68 [EV-D68], rhinovirus C [RV-C]) and gastrointestinal
(enterovirus A71 [EV-A71], echovirus 11 [E11]). Studying these diverse viruses will best prepare us to respond
to an emergent picornavirus with unknown properties. Our first specific aim focuses on understanding the
polyclonal humoral immune response to picornavirus infections. We will leverage biobanked samples from a
previous study, new samples from a recently funded cohort, and our Virologic and Immunologic Sample
Acquisition Core (VISAC) samples to identify children with high neutralizing serum titers against the prototype
viruses. We will use cryo-electron microscopy to map the binding of polyclonal antibodies from these sera to
purified viruses to identify epitopes. We will supplement these data with tiled peptide arrays to
comprehensively analyze linear B cell epitopes of RV-C proteins. We will use these advanced techniques to
analyze sera before and after defined infections to define antibody binding patterns before and after children
develop high neutralization titers in their serum. Our second specific aim focuses on monoclonal antibody
(mAb) discovery. Starting with our established EV-D68 human mAb isolation methods, we will speed the time
of discovery from months to about two weeks, then use these methods to isolate EV-A71 and E11 mAbs. Our
prior screening methods (identifying mAbs that bind to native virions in ELISA) are suboptimal for RV-C, so we
will develop new screening methods for this virus that will better prepare us to respond to emergent pathogens.
As we identify new antiviral mAbs, we will select strongly neutralizing mAbs for study in our Structural Biology
Core and test them in models of infection developed in Project 1 of this program. We will use protective mAbs
as quality control reagents to ensure that new candidate vaccines maintain antigenicity at the cognate
epitopes. Finally, we will license protective mAbs to our industry partners to develop for therapeutic use in
humans."
10863661,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RP3
RNA vaccines are one of the most promising vaccine platforms available to rapidly deploy in response to
emerging viral infections with pandemic potential. However, mechanistic investigations of how various mRNA
vaccine approaches induce protective immune responses are warranted. The order Bunyavirales comprises
multiple families of viruses causing severe human disease. No FDA-licensed vaccines currently exist for any
Bunyavirales virus, and medical countermeasures for infection are limited. For example, Andes virus (ANDV)
caused a human outbreak with aggressive human-to-human transmission and multiple fatalities in 2019,
highlighting the pandemic potential of hantaviruses. This proposal includes development and preclinical testing
of innovative RNA vaccines against multiple bunyavirales and investigation of mechanisms of protection of three
forms of RNA vaccines against representative New and Old World hantaviruses: ANDV, Sin Nombre virus (SNV)
and Hantaan virus (HTNV). The following Aims will be pursued.
 Specific Aim 1. To convert existing DNA/JET vaccines to Hantaviridae, Arenaviridae, and Nairoviridae
viruses to lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccines (industrial partner, Moderna) and evaluate immunogenicity
and protective efficacy of homologous and heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategies in established in-
house small animal models. This aim will be based on extensive preliminary data, including clinical trials, on
bunyavirales DNA vaccines and unsurpassed LNP-mRNA industrial experience of Moderna.
 Specific Aim 2. To generate LNP and polymer nanoparticle (PNP)-formulated vaccines against SNV and
HTNV based on non-modified mRNA, modified mRNA or circular RNA. In addition to the non-modified and
modified mRNA and circular RNA vaccines against ANDV we already developed, we will use these three
platforms to generate vaccines against SNV and HTNV. We will use the platforms to generate the constructs
expressing the N protein of ANDV, SNV and HTNV. The most promising constructs will be selected for
encapsulation in PNP. As PNP formulations are expected to be less stringent for low-temperature requirements,
we will test stability at various temperatures.
 Specific Aim 3. To perform an in-depth comparative investigation of the protective efficacy and
immunogenicity of the new RNA vaccine constructs and formulations. We will perform in-depth studies of the
immune response to the three vaccine platforms and two nanoparticle formulations in animal models.
By the end of the funding period, we expect to have developed effective, innovative RNA vaccines against
multiple Bunyavirales viruses and justified their promise to advance to clinical trials. The proposed studies will
result in unparalleled insights into the antibody responses to mRNA vaccines and differences in antibody
responses to vaccines based on modified versus non-modified RNA and linear versus circular RNA platforms.
This knowledge will be critical for developing effective vaccines against emerging viral infections in general."
10863662,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RP4
The hantaviruses represent collections of diverse virus species, and these groups of viruses are ideal for
prototype pathogen immunity approaches. The goal of developing medical countermeasures is to confer
protective immunity to hantaviruses, which can be provided by active immunization (as in our BP4 consortium
RP3 colleagues) or by passive immunization with long-acting (90-day half-life) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
In this RP4, we will used several different state-of-the-art antibody discovery approaches to isolate and
engineer optimal mAbs for this major of viruses. Virus-immune B cells will be interrogated with several well-
developed human mAb discovery platforms, including high-throughput single cell sorting and single cell
RNAseq techniques, or converted to stable human hybridoma cell lines. B cell line supernatants or
recombinant mAbs will be subjected to high-throughput screening to identify Abs that bind to hantavirus
surface proteins and functionally inhibit virus replication. Our objectives include determining the principles
governing optimal mAb combinations and synergy, developing new in vitro selection methods to enhance
antibody neutralization potency and breadth, and genetically modifying mAbs for extended-half-life properties
to enable the use of injections of long-lived antibodies to confer protective immunity and protection like that of
vaccines. Lessons learned in the year 1 to 3 studies of the prototype viruses Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and
Andes virus (ANDV) will be applied to new discovery campaigns for related viruses in the same family or
genera. We will focus these efforts on Hantaan virus as a model for applying Test Cases for the prototype
pathogen approach. Identifying antibodies to Hantaan virus will validate the prototype pathogens approach,
preparing us for an unexpected epidemic of a previously unknown hantavirus or other bunyavirus. Also, this
program will isolate promising medical countermeasures for additional potential causes of future epidemics.
Further, incorporating screens for wide breadth of recognition in these studies may enable identification of pan-
family or pan-genus antibodies that can but used for multiple related agents, including future related pathogens
for which we have not yet specifically prepared. Identifying major sites of vulnerability on the virus surface Gn-
Gc proteins for recognition by neutralizing and/or protective antibodies also will be useful for our consortium
partners working on antigen design. Prioritized mAbs then will be tested for therapeutic efficacy in multiple
animal models of infection. The lead mAbs will be selected, and CHO cell lines will be made by our industry
partner IDBiologics for Ab production, in preparation for cGMP manufacture and IND planning. The work
promises to yield best-in-class mAb combinations for broad and potent activity against hantaviruses that can
be used to treat or prevent human virus infections. These studies will identify protective/neutralizing epitopes of
mAbs through structural studies of antigen-Ab complexes that inform immunogen design in RP3 using rational
vaccine antigen design approaches."

Arenaviruses, a family of viruses with pandemic potential, can cause hemorrhagic fever, meningitis, and other
clinical syndromes. These viruses include highly pathogenic strains such as Lassa virus (LASV) and Junín
virus (JUNV), as well as less pathogenic strains like lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In this project,
we aim to focus on two major areas, active immunity induced by experimental vaccines and passive immunity
conferred by injection with human monoclonal antibodies. The later studies will include the study of extended
half-life protective antibodies bearing Fc mutations that cause ≥90-day half-life profiles in humans and thus
enable a vaccine-like prophylactic profile of a year or more. First, in studies in Aim 1, we will compare leading
vaccine platform technologies and define immune correlates of protection for LCMV in nonhuman primate
models of infection (macaques) as a virus prototype. Understanding the principles of immunity to this prototype
virus will allow us then to pivot and use those mechanistic insights to design and test vaccines for other
arenaviruses. This work will allow us to fully explore replicating attenuated LCMV vectors as a strategy for
developing candidate arenavirus vaccines. We also will explore the hypothesis that both antibodies and T cell
responses contribute to vaccine -induced protection against LCMV. Next, in studies in Aim 2, we will focus on
deploying optimal vaccine strategies for other arenaviruses of pandemic concerns, LASV and JUNV. Lastly, in
work in Aim 3, we will identify and characterize fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and their
epitope targets, with initial work in LCMV antibody discovery providing a platform for further work on other
medically important arenaviruses. This project will be synergistic with other projects in the BP4 center focusing
on picornavirus and hantavirus vaccines and with the BP4 human monoclonal antibody projects to develop
candidate arenavirus, picornavirus, and hantavirus medical countermeasures."

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndromes (IC/BPS) are a debilitating condition with unknown etiology. The
spinal cord has long been identified as a critical site in integrating both non-noxious (bladder function) and
noxious (intense bladder pressure or discomfort) sensory information from the bladder. These spinal circuits
are known to exert a tighter control over bladder voiding and storage under naïve state. While the role of
lumbosacral spinal cord neural circuitry in micturition and bladder sensation has long been studied, the precise
cell types in the spinal cord that contribute to processing micturition and bladder nociception remains poorly
understood. In preliminary studies, we have discovered two unique cell populations in the spinal cord that play
a role in micturition and bladder nociception. Here we propose to build on this preliminary work to methodically
dissect the roles of these spinal neurons in the voiding regulation and bladder nociception in pathological
cystitis state. We will determine if cystitis leads to maladaptive changes in these spinal cord neurons. Could
manipulating activity of these spinal cord neurons potentially attenuate bladder symptoms associated with
pathological cystitis state? Completing these proposed studies, will advances our understanding of spinal
circuits in cystitis and will provide a possible entry point into the spinal circuits for development of possible
therapeutic drugs in treatment of the IC/BPS."

This study focuses on understanding the complex nature of chronic pain by investigating the communication
between distinct brain circuits. We aim to unravel the mechanisms by which somatosensory, cognitive, and
affective information is integrated to produce the percept of pain. By studying network dynamics across key brain
regions using direct intracranial recordings and graph theory approaches, we will elucidate spatiotemporal
activity patterns that underlie the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain. Previous studies have identified
specific brain regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula,
sensory and medial thalamus, periventricular grey matter, and primary sensorimotor cortices, as crucial hubs
involved in regulating chronic pain traits. However, the dynamic functioning of these networks in influencing the
fluctuating nature of chronic pain, which can vary over minutes to days, remains less understood. To bridge this
knowledge gap, the study proposes the use of direct intracranial recordings from patients with chronic pain and
combines them with graph theory approaches to analyze network dynamics. We aim to study pain circuits in the
laboratory and naturalistic environments by investigating the impact of expectation and mood on descending
circuits and determining if they influence pain through similar mechanisms. The hypothesis is that brain
stimulation relieving pain engages descending control mechanisms similar to positive mood or expectation, while
a breakdown in corticothalamic functional connectivity is associated with episodes of elevated pain. The study
proposes three specific aims. Aim 1 involves analyzing intracranial recordings from chronic pain patients to track
changes in functional connectivity within corticothalamic networks during spontaneous pain and pain-relieving
brain stimulation. Aim 2 focuses on examining the interaction between ascending and descending circuits during
a cognitive pain-expectation task using recordings from patients with DBS electrodes. Aim 3 investigates the role
of affective state on pain perception and descending pain circuits during a mood modulating task. Our group
aims to identify patterns of functional connectivity and coherence between key brain hubs, such as the ACC,
medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and thalamus, and understand their relationship with pain perception. By
clarifying the underlying mechanisms of chronic pain and the effects of brain stimulation, mood, and expectation,
this study has the potential to contribute to the development of novel diagnostic tools and more effective
treatments for chronic pain disorders."

teams from academia, government, and industry. Central to PROVIDENT is its focus on platform strategies
that can rapidly advance manufacturable products with pathways to regulatory approval and plans for their
commercialization through industry partners who are integral to our consortium. PROVIDENT will accomplish
its goals by synthesizing the activities of four Research Projects, supported by three Research Cores and a
Data Management Core, and overseen by the Administrative Core. Using a prototype virus strategy in Phase I,
we will: (i) discover and dissect host factors and pathways critical for viral infection and pathogenesis and de-
liver tools to other PROVIDENT components to facilitate vaccine and immunotherapeutic development; (ii) use
advanced antigen engineering to refine vaccine design strategies through iterative assessments of immuno-
genicity and protective efficacy to generate optimized vaccine immunogens; (iii) develop RNA vaccines and
evaluate two platforms to optimize immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and safety and (iv) generate an adap-
tive antibody development pipeline that will complement and inform vaccine design strategies. In Phase II, we
will evaluate our prototype-optimized vaccine platforms against our divergent outgroup viruses in a series of
timed exercises we term “sprints,” which seek to generate a vaccine product ready to immunize animals in 10
days. In doing so, we will perform cross-family validations of our vaccine platforms for nairoviruses, han-
taviruses, and paramyxoviruses as a rigorous challenge to the generalizability of the Phase I blueprint deliver-
able, and either validate the blueprint or identify weaknesses for further refinement."

The goal of this new application is to define the role of the chromatin modifier Dot1L (Disruptor of telomeric
silencing-1 like) in normal skeletal growth and development. Dot1L is the only enzyme that catalyzes the
methylation of lysine 79 in histone 3 (H3K79), which plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene
expression. The only molecular function that has been demonstrated for Dot1L resides in its catalytic or
methyltransferase (MT) domain, however new studies indicate that non-catalytic functions of Dot1L also
contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation. Currently, very little is known about how
Dot1L regulates skeletal growth and development. This represents a critical gap in our knowledge because
Dot1L targeted approaches are being studied as therapies for pediatric cancers. We recently reported that the
conditional loss of Dot1L expression in limb mesenchyme induced an aberrant skeletal phenotype characterized
by long bone shortening, and defects in growth plate (GP) chondrocyte proliferation. Interestingly, small molecule
inhibition of Dot1L catalytic activity did not impair chondrocyte proliferation in vitro, suggesting an underlying but
critical role for non-catalytic functions of Dot1L in these complex processes. Chemical inhibition of Dot1L in
chondrogenic limb bud micromass assays resulted in premature chondrocyte hypertrophy through mis-regulation
of the Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling pathway. New in vivo data from our lab provides compelling
evidence that a catalytic inactive Dot1L mutant protein can restore the cartilage GP dysfunction and long bone
growth deficits in mice with conditional loss of Dot1L function in limb mesenchyme. Together, these data, support
our novel central hypothesis that Dot1L regulates long bone growth at the GP through: i) non-catalytic activities
that support chondrocyte proliferation; and ii) MT-dependent activities which restrict chondrocyte maturation. We
have assembled a strong team of investigators with expertise in skeletal biology, epigenetics, and Dot1L biology
to address this novel hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will establish the functional requirement for Dot1L catalytic activity
in endochondral bone growth in vivo, using novel Dot1L MT mutant mice. Our studies will determine whether a
catalytic-dead Dot1L mutant can rescue skeletal defects in Dot1L cKOPrrx1 mice. We will apply single cell
transcriptomic analyses to identify novel Dot1L-regulated genes and pathways. In Aim 2, we will define the
regulatory functions of Dot1L that provide stage-specific control of chondrogenic differentiation. Using Dot1L
knockout versus MT mutant cells, mechanistic studies will assess the direct contribution of Dot1L catalytic versus
non-catalytic functions to chondrocyte proliferation versus hypertrophy. Lastly, ChIPseq experiments will identify
genome-wide methylation patterns (H3K79me2) associated with chondrocyte proliferation and maturation.
Outcomes from these studies are expected to generate new knowledge on Dot1L during normal skeletal growth
and development, with implications for targeting Dot1L therapeutically."

The overarching goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to
provide Dr. Dawn Sugarman with the training and research activities needed to become an independent
investigator with expertise in using digital technology to increase access to evidence-based treatment for
women with opioid use disorder (OUD). This application outlines an integrated training and research plan that
will provide Dr. Sugarman with the skills needed to achieve her career goal. Under the mentorship of experts in
substance use disorders, OUD, and digital health, Dr. Sugarman’s training will focus on the following key
areas: (1) digital health design and research (Drs. Lisa Marsch and Kathleen Carroll); (2) etiology and
treatment of individuals with OUD (Drs. Shelly Greenfield and Roger Weiss); and (3) statistical methods for
longitudinal data analysis (Dr. Garrett Fitzmaurice). Training in these three areas will be achieved through
didactic and applied activities, participation in national conferences and institutes, and mentoring meetings. Dr.
Sugarman will apply the skills acquired during the training activities to a research project focused on
developing an innovative strategy for increasing initiation in medication treatment for opioid use disorder
(MOUD) in women with OUD. Research shows that MOUD is effective but underutilized. With rising rates of
fatal opioid overdoses in women, it is critical to develop sustainable strategies to engage and retain women in
MOUD. Women with OUD have more medical problems, greater functional impairment, and greater psychiatric
severity than men with OUD. Gender-specific treatments have been developed for women with substance use
disorders and are associated with reduced substance use and increased continuity of care; however,
widespread use has been restricted due to in-person delivery models, and they have not been specifically
adapted to target engagement in OUD treatment. Moreover, there is a lack of research demonstrating effective
strategies to implement this care for women in mixed-gender settings. To address this gap, the proposed K23
research project will utilize a user-centered design process to develop a digital platform to deliver gender-
specific care that addresses the individualized needs of women with OUD in mixed-gender settings. The
central hypothesis is that a gender-specific digital intervention will overcome the barriers of in-person delivery
and will increase women’s initiation in MOUD. This research will address key gaps in treatment for women with
OUD by: (1) developing a gender-specific digital intervention (GSDI) for women with OUD; and (2) conducting
a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility of delivering the GSDI to women with OUD during
and immediately after OUD stabilization. Preliminary estimates on the effect of the GSDI on MOUD initiation
will also be examined. These data will inform the design of a larger Stage II efficacy trial for a future R01
application. Dr. Sugarman’s training and proposed research will be carried out at McLean Hospital and Harvard
Medical School, which will provide her with a multitude of resources to meet her goals."

strong record of accomplishment in supporting post-doctoral fellows and pre-tenured faculty from
underrepresented groups (URG) obtain external research funding and progress to research independence.
The proposed multi-PIs co-lead a similar, highly successful P30 Research Centers for Minority Aging Research
(RCMAR) from NIA that has recruited, engaged, and supported 61 early-career URG researchers over the last
21 years, and both multi-PIs have a strong record of NIDDK funding over the last two decades. We will be
able to leverage our research, clinical, policy, and program evaluation expertise in the area of diabetes care
and prevention in identifying and/or developing talented URG researchers throughout Southern California.
UCLA LIFT-UP builds on the scientific strengths in the UCLA CTSI, UCLA Department of Medicine, and the
UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. We propose three LIFT-UP Program Cores - an Administrative Core
(AC), Research Mentorship Core (RMC), and Research Support Core (RSC). The RMC and the RSC will each
be co-led by a basic scientist and a clinical outcomes/health services researcher, to enhance coordination of
research mentorship and research support for investigators across the translational research spectrum. To
accomplish these goals, the UCLA LIFT-UP overarching Specific Aims are to:
 1. Provide the comprehensive guidance required to promote successful academic advancement of 14-17
 early URG researchers through mentorship and pilot research awards in the areas of obesity and
 diabetes across the translational research spectrum;
 2. Engage URG researchers in cutting-edge laboratory-based science that advances the mechanistic
 understanding of molecular and physiologic processes related to obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes,
 and related conditions;
 3. Develop the research infrastructure needed to improve the health of patients with obesity and/or
 diabetes through the development, implementation, and evaluation of community and health system
 partnered interventions and policies designed to mitigate health disparities.
The goal of LIFT-UP will be to mentor and develop highly skilled early career URG scientists whose passion
and careers are devoted to preventing and treating obesity and diabetes, and working to achieve health equity
in disease areas aligned with the mission of the NIDDK. We will accomplish this by aggressively identifying
and recruiting the most talented URG candidates in Southern California and embedding them in the strongest,
most comprehensive faculty development program possible."

The objective of the Center for Lung Biology and Disease (CLBD) at Louisiana State University (LSU) is to
advance the study of life-threatening respiratory diseases, including bacterial and viral lung infections, asthma,
and acute lung injury. Its thematic focus encompasses mechanistic studies of respiratory diseases induced by
both infectious (bacterial, viral) and non-infectious (e.g., environmental, cigarette, e-cigarette aerosols) stimuli.
The CLBD accomplishes this by fostering the development of Promising Junior Investigators (PJIs, i.e.,
Research Project Leads) conducting research in this field. The Administrative Core (Admin Core) will play a
critical role in supporting the administration, coordination, and management of all CLBD functions, particularly
those most critical to PJI development. The CLBD is administered primarily in the LSU School of Veterinary
Medicine, Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, in close collaboration with the Department of
Pathobiological Sciences and the LSU College of Sciences. In a tremendously successful first phase of
funding, the CLBD worked to provide newly renovated animal holding and research space, including ABSL2/3
space, a personalized mentoring program for PJIs, state-of-the-art instrumentation, a pilot projects program,
and cutting-edge expertise in molecular and cell biology. These enhancements were accomplished through
impactful research cores and a dynamic seminar program and yearly conference that promote research
education and networking among PJIs and their trainees. Phase 1 resources established PJIs and Pilot Grant
Investigators in productive and impactful research programs, evidenced by 13 NIH grant awards. Using vacant
faculty positions in both the LSU Vet Med and the College of Sciences, we will expand on Phase I successes
by further expanding our research expertise and infrastructure. Within this context, the Admin Core will 1)
provide fiscal and administrative support for all projects and research cores and implement regular outcomes
evaluation, 2) advance the scientific development of PJIs as independent investigators through a rigorous but
individualized mentoring program, and 3) promote and facilitate research interactions between the lung
COBRE and the wider scientific community. Moreover, the Admin Core will oversee additional improvements
and investment, including a 3-fold expansion of our ABSL3 laboratory space ($4 million), which will include
space for inhalation and infection co-exposures. With these enhancements and our growing depth of expertise
in lung biology, we aim to raise the profile of our team and build toward a sustainable Center of Excellence."

in the Department of Genetics at the School of Medicine. Virtually all of the trainees over the last funding period
have been matriculated in the Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics & Development Track (MCGD) in Biological and
Biomedical Sciences at Yale. The proposed training program is focused on the use of genetic, genomic and
computational approaches to understand human biology and disease. Training encompasses three core
domains: 1) The genetics of human health and disease, encompassing disease gene discovery and the
interpretation of human genetic variation; 2) Experimental studies in model organisms to understand how human
genetic variation influences human biology and disease; and 3) Genomic technologies and computational
approaches to obtain biological insights from complex genomic datasets, both in human and model systems.
Training faculty include investigators who are world leaders in each of these domains. This integrated training
environment provides trainees with broad exposure to genetics, genomics and computational biology, and a rich
training environment that prepares them for careers in science. Students admitted into the program have strong
scientific backgrounds and research experience with high academic achievement. First year students are
supported by Yale. Students are then supported by the training grant in years 2 and 3, and thereafter by funds
in Training Faculty laboratories until graduation. Training in the first year includes formal course work focused
on genetics, genomics and data analysis, as well as research rotations leading to selection of the thesis advisor
and laboratory. In the second year, students complete course work and take a qualifying exam in which they
must demonstrate mastery of genetics and defend a written research proposal. Subsequent years are devoted
to dissertation research, development of experimental and analytic skills, and skills in written and oral
presentation, leading to preparation and publication of the thesis work. In addition, students engage in supervised
teaching experiences. The students also participate in Departmental and new Program-specific activities,
including a Program Symposium and a Career Development Workshop. These activities provide students with
targeted mentoring and career development opportunities and will help them develop a professional network of
peers and senior colleagues that they can draw upon throughout their careers. Support is requested for 5 years
for 7 Ph.D. students per year. Trainees are highly successful in completing their Ph.D. thesis work, publishing
their work in high-impact journals, and the vast majority continue to contribute to science after leaving the
program."

About 18 million men in the U.S. are affected by erectile dysfunction (ED), and it is estimated to affect
322 million men worldwide by 2025. ED is caused by various conditions that perturb vascular, nervous and/or
hormonal systems, imposing profound negative impacts on quality of life and well-being of affected males.
Advent of oral formulations of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (e.g., Viagra®) has provided a breakthrough
in managing ED to a certain degree but are frequently ineffective due to underlying neurovascular dysfunction,
and often accompanies systemic side effects and undesired drug-drug interactions. To this end, a therapeutic
modality that can intervene the natural histology of the disease among a broader affected population is sorely
needed. We have recently discovered that human recombinant stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) promotes
regeneration of penile vasculatures, nerves and muscles to restore erectile function in a rat model of ED. The
improvement was associated with increases in major pelvic ganglion neurons and growth factor expression,
upregulation of stem-cell associated genes and decrease in penile fibrosis. Importantly, SDF-1 targets a broad
array of repair mechanisms by acting directly on resident tissues and activating stem-cell associated repair
pathways to enhance the integrity of tissue architecture and functional response. However, protein-based
therapy requires multiple and frequent doses to meet the required therapeutic window, leading to economic
and compliance issues. This is of particular concern for SDF-1 due to its very short half-live, measured in
minutes. We thus propose here to develop mRNA-based SDF-1 therapy, with a particular focus on designing
nanoparticle-based platforms providing safety and efficient mRNA delivery to penile cells, for sustainable ED
treatment. Our interest lies in nanoparticles based on environmentally-sensitive cationic polymers that
gradually degrade in physiological environments to facilitate mRNA release, ideally in intracellular milieu, and
removal of carrier materials from body. Encouragingly, our pilot data demonstrates that at least four
nanoparticles based on our custom-synthesized polymers provide significantly enhanced reporter mRNA
expression in rodent penile tissues in vivo compared to a gold-standard polymeric delivery system. We note
that chemical variations of these polymers can further improve mRNA delivery characteristics, such as broader
tissue coverage and/or enhanced transfection efficiency. To this end, we will synthesize a panel of chemically-
distinct environmentally-sensitive polymers and extensive screen in vitro and in vivo to determine lead
candidates that provide highly efficiently and safe penile mRNA expression. The lead candidates will then be
used to package and deliver optimized SDF-1 mRNA into the injured penile tissues of a rat model of ED to
establish clinical relevance. Successful execution of the proposed studies would pave the way for clinical
development of novel mRNA-based therapy for treating patients with ED, particularly those poorly responsive
to current standard-of-care treatments."

 Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has dramatically improved outcomes for children living with HIV (CHIV) but
poses challenges including poor adherence, side-effects, stigma, and drug resistance. An HIV cure would
address these challenges but has been elusive due to the latent HIV reservoir that persists despite ART. To
advance pediatric HIV cure, it is important to identify determinants and consequences of the pediatric HIV
reservoir. Recent adult studies have shown differences in the decline of total versus intact HIV reservoir and
have demonstrated antigen-related clonal proliferation of the reservoir, with enriched HIV provirus in memory T-
cells responding to CMV, EBV, HIV, influenza, or tetanus antigens. Acute CMV frequently occurs concurrent with
HIV infection in infancy and elicits a substantial immune response; this may result in increased HIV-proviral
infection of CMV-responsive immune cells. Indeed, we recently found that earlier and cumulative CMV viremia
were associated with increased HIV total reservoir size in CHIV. There are few epidemiologic studies to estimate
population-level impact of antigen-specific proliferation; and scant data from pediatric cohorts on intact HIV
reservoir. In addition to impeding eradication of HIV, the HIV reservoir may also influence neurocognitive
outcomes due to the trafficking between systemic and CNS compartments potentially via HIV reservoir-
containing immune cells.
 We have had 4 cycles of a renewed NIH R01 (NICHD R01-023412). Cycle 3 of the R01 involved a cohort of
early-treated Kenyan infants (OPH cohort) which we have continued to follow-up to examine HIV reservoir. Our
team has optimized a novel intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) for Kenyan subtypes which provides quantitative
estimates of intact and defective virus. Building on this work, we propose a competitive renewal of our R01 to
examine the influence of cumulative and episodic CMV/EBV activation on the intact HIV reservoir and the
relationship between HIV reservoir and long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Aim 1. Compare reservoir clonal
dynamics in children who initiated ART during concurrent acute HIV/ acute CMV infection (early-ART) to children
who initiated ART during chronic HIV/CMV (late-ART) and to mothers who initiated ART during chronic HIV/CMV.
Aim 2. Quantify the influence of CMV/EBV antigenic stimulation on HIV intact/defective reservoir size in
longitudinal molecular epidemiologic studies over >15-year follow-up. Aim 3. Determine influence of total and
intact HIV reservoir on long-term neurocognitive outcomes. These aims will provide novel data on the pediatric
HIV reservoir that will inform strategies for HIV cure and to optimize neurocognitive outcomes in CHIV."
10831040,"Project Summary/Abstract
GPCRs are the largest family of membrane bound signaling molecules and, collectively, the target of many
drugs currently used in the clinic. Classically, GPCRs were thought to be active at the cell surface and inactive
while undergoing molecular sorting and trafficking events within the cell. Recent work has overturned this
model. GPCRs are not quiescent inside of cells. Instead, it is now known that GPCRs can activate G protein
signaling from many intracellular compartments including the endosome, and this intracellular signaling
changes drug response. While efforts are already underway to harness endosomal GPCR signaling as a drug
target, much is unknown about GPCR sorting at endosomes and how these trafficking processes control
endosomal GPCR signaling. The goal of this proposal is to address the knowledge gap surrounding GPCR
sorting at endosomes, and to determine how these pathways control endosomal signaling. In Project 1 we test
the hypothesis that endosomal sorting functions as a kinetic timer to control GPCR signaling at endosomes.
We examine a prototypical GPCR, the beta 2 adrenergic receptor, and the use a combination of genetic
engineering and proteomics to determine how sorting controls endosomal signaling. In Project 2 we focus on
two different GPCRs which signal at endosomes but lack any of the consensus endosomal sorting motifs. We
use a combination of chemical biology, genomics, and proteomics to identify the proteins and pathways which
mediate endosomal sorting of these receptors. Our studies seek to reveal fundamental lessons about
conserved cell biological pathways while driving forward a new area for future GPCR drug development."
10853042,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an essential regulator of calcium homeostasis and became the prototypic
osteoanabolic hormone for treating osteoporosis. On the other hand, hyperparathyroidism, with its consequent
bone breakdown, is a major problem in and of itself and in chronic renal failure. The hormone acts through its
G-protein-coupled receptor on the osteoblast to elicit enhanced bone resorption by the osteoclast. To do this,
the osteoblast produces receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL) in response to PTH.
RANKL is widely considered a principal mediator of PTH-induced bone catabolism and has been associated
with bone loss in hyperparathyroidism. Our work in the last cycle of this grant revealed that PTH activates
cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) and requires protein phosphatases (PPs) to
stimulate Rankl expression in osteoblasts. Knockdown of salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) 2 and 3 and cAMP-
regulated transcription coactivators 2 and 3 (CRTC2 and 3) indicate that all four are part of this pathway.
Moreover, inhibition of serine-threonine protein phosphatases decreased both PTH-induced Rankl expression
and the stimulation by PTH(1-34) of CRTC2 and 3 translocation into the nucleus. Upon entry into the nucleus,
these CRTCs associate with unknown basic leucine zipper domain (bZip) transcription factor(s), activating
Rankl transcription through binding to its distal PTH-responsive cAMP-response elements (CREs). From these
data of cells in culture and preliminary data in vivo, we have developed the central hypothesis that SIK/PP
regulation of CRTC2/3 is essential to their function in the skeleton, and PTH controls this regulation. The long-
term goals of this work are to delineate the signaling and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms conveying
PTH action in bone. Consequently, the specific aims to test our hypothesis of this resubmitted competing
renewal proposal focus on the SIK and PP regulation of CRTC2/3 function and action on Rankl, and will, 1)
determine the mechanism of PTH regulation of Rankl transcription in osteoblasts by a. elucidating the
regulatory mechanisms involved in CRTC2/3 nuclear translocation in osteoblasts, b. identifying the bZip
transcription factor(s) responsible for CRTC2/3-induced Rankl transcription, 2) determine the role of CRTC2/3
in bone development and PTH’s anabolic and catabolic effects by a. determining the site and role of osteoblast
CRTC2/3 in bone development, b. ascertaining the effects of deletion of CRTC2/3 on PTH’s anabolic and
catabolic actions in bones of adult mice. The results of this work will make major contributions to our
knowledge of how PTH exerts its nuclear effects on skeletal function through the SIK/PP/CRTC/bZip pathway.
In so doing, the data will also provide new perspectives into treatment of disorders of calcium metabolism and
other severe diseases functioning through the PTHR1 pathway such as Jansen’s metaphyseal
chondrodysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome."

The ability to modify ongoing gait with precise, voluntary adjustments is what allows animals to navigate
complex terrains and to execute skilled actions during ongoing pursuits. However, how the nervous system
generates the signals to precisely control the lower limbs while simultaneously maintaining ongoing locomotion
is still poorly understood. While there is some consensus in the role of spinal cord (SC) central pattern
generators (CPGs) in the maintenance of locomotion, little is known about the role of primary motor cortex
(M1), especially in the case of volitional adjustments to ongoing locomotion movements. Our own work
suggests that M 1 plays at least a dual role in both the monitoring and the adjustment of the hindlimbs during
locomotor adjustments, expressed in different subspaces (manifolds) of its neuronal spiking activity. We
hypothesize that the emergence of these distinct neural subspaces plays a critical role in the dynamic
sensorimotor cortical control of locomotion. Specifically, the emergence of distinct low-dimensional subspaces
allows M1 to track sensed ongoing locomotion states, which are primarily driven by spinal-cord CPGs, and to
generate occasional descending motor commands to drive volitional adjustments without destructive
interference. Besides the basic neuroscience relevance, fully understanding the role of M1 in modulating
locomotion is essential for the development of new mobility therapies, including brain-machine interfaces
(BMls), for restoring walking and volitional leg control in people with paralysis. We have recently developed a
new experimental paradigm to test these hypotheses in nonhuman primates. It enables wireless recordings
from microelectrode arrays implanted in multiple sensorimotor cortical areas during natural locomotion and
navigation around obstacles visually cued on a treadmill and other spaces. In addition to M 1, we plan to
simultaneously record primary sensorimotor cortex (S1) and lower limb electromyography (EMG), while
actively probing M1-S1-SC interactions via cortical and spinal electrical stimulation. There are 3 specific aims.
AIM 1: To test the hypothesis that information streams necessary for the control of ongoing locomotion and
volitional adjustments are coordinated in motor cortex activity via the emergence of distinct neural subspaces.
AIM 2: To test the hypothesis that specific subspaces emerge to coordinate the bidirectional interactions
between M 1 and S 1 during sensorimotor control of ongoing locomotion and volitional adjustments. Finally, we
have previously shown that neural decoders trained on ongoing locomotion do not generalize to the decoding
of volitional adjustments, thus motivating AIM 3: To develop adaptive BM I neural decoding approaches for
locomotion under distinct regimes of sensorimotor cortical control. PUBLIC/HEALTH/RELEVANCE: This
research's long-term goal is the restoration of movement in people with paralysis. The project will advance the
understanding of sensorimotor control of locomotion and lead to better BM Is for restoring walking ability in
humans with spinal cord injury due to partial damage of ascending and descending pathways."

Abstract: Retinal ciliopathies are a group of inherited retina degenerative disorders that currently lack a
detailed understanding of their pathological mechanisms. However, it is widely believed that deficiencies in
ciliary architecture and protein trafficking specific to cilia are the main culprits behind these disorders. We
have developed a method to monitor the trafficking of membrane proteins by specifically labeling newly
synthesized proteins and discriminating against old proteins. By using this method in combination with state-
of-the-art microscopy, biochemistry, and molecular biology techniques, we propose two Specific Aims: (1)
Elucidate the mechanisms regulating rhodopsin compartmentalization in normal and pathological conditions.
We aim to test the hypothesis that disruptions in the VxPx motif may lead to the miscoordination of other
localization signals, resulting in rhodopsin mistrafficking. Our previous research has shown that rhodopsin
contains multiple localization signals that work together with VxPx for proper and efficient ciliary transport. By
utilizing affinity purification and mass spectrometry techniques, we will identify rhodopsin-binding partners
involved in the trafficking and mistrafficking of rhodopsin. We will then study the roles of these partners in
rhodopsin trafficking under both normal and pathological conditions. (2) Elucidate the septin cytoskeleton's
role in organizing rod photoreceptors' membrane architecture. Previous study indicates that the OS plasma
membrane is segregated into two domains, one for phototransduction and the other for disk synthesis.
Furthermore, the OS plasma membrane is segregated from IS plasma membrane. Our recent study
suggests that a cytoskeletal element septin is located at the interfaces of these membrane compartments.
We will study the contributions of septin to the membrane architecture of rod photoreceptors, both under
normal and pathological conditions.
Through these studies, we aim to enhance the comprehension of retinal ciliopathies by exploring the structural
separation of rod sensory cilia. Additionally, our research aims to uncover new therapeutic options for
degenerative disorders of the retina that result from rhodopsin mislocalization. An example would be the
inhibition of rhodopsin partners responsible for mistrafficking, as it can effectively alleviate rhodopsin toxicity."

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a severe disease with a low median survival rate of six years and a declining quality of life.
JAK2 inhibitors have revolutionized treatment for patients with MF; however, only 30%-40% of patients respond
strongly to this therapy. Identifying non-responders early is vital to clinically recommend higher-risk by effective
alternative therapies that are not suggested as first-line treatments. Histopathologic examination of bone marrow
biopsies is the current standard for identifying non-responders. However, this process is failing patients as it
takes three years to reach a definitive conclusion. We aim to reduce this assessment period to six months,
thereby improving health outcomes for non-responders and increasing their chances of recovery before the
disease causes irreparable damage. This research is essential because non-responders comprise most treated
MF patients (60%-70%).
To accurately monitor treatment response, it is necessary to identify hematopoietic BM areas and recognize
abnormal reticulin-fibers patterns within these areas. However, current methods are inadequate, as they can
only identify non-responders reliably after three years. Therefore, we propose a new technology that addresses
all the challenges with MF treatment assessment in a single instrument. This technology is observer-
independent, label-free, and quantitative, filling a critical gap in the state-of-the-art. Although histopathology is
the gold-standard method, it is susceptible to high inter-observer variability in MF due to the qualitative nature of
visual inspections. This variability is because of the difficulty in recognizing fiber-pattern trends from
immunohistochemical staining data. Our technology overcomes these limitations by providing a comprehensive
and quantitative evaluation of the evolution of fibrosis in MF.
Our proposed method using mid-infrared spectroscopic imaging (MIRSI) technologies and machine learning
addresses an unmet clinical need in assessing the treatment response of MF, benefiting thousands of patients.
Our preliminary studies show that MIRSI can distinguish between different tissue subtypes, including
hematopoietic tissue, with high accuracy and create detailed maps of reticulin fiber disorganization within
hematopoietic areas, providing a precise visualization of fibrosis progression. We propose using a MIRSI-based
treatment response score to identify early trends in disease progression. We aim to validate our approach using
678 samples spanning multiple time points for each patient. This strategy will provide a robust numerical tracking
of fibrosis progression, facilitate early identification of non-responders, allow them to transfer to novel therapies
with disease-modifying activity, and improve the current treatment paradigm."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
several other major comorbidities. Hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is maintained by the balance
between anabolic hormones, primarily insulin, and catabolic hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.
Our novel findings show that norepinephrine (NE) resistance occurs within a week of high fat diet (HFD) feeding
in mice. This proposal seeks to determine the molecular mechanisms leading to the suppression of NE signaling
and the effect this has on hepatic metabolism and the pathogenesis of NALFD and T2DM.
NE and related hormones act through G-protein coupled receptors linked to Gq/11 and phospholipase C to
generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, which induce cytosolic
Ca2+ oscillations in individual hepatocytes. These dynamic Ca2+ signals are integrated in the intact liver by
intercellular propagation of Ca2+ waves across entire hepatic lobules, from the periportal (PP) to the pericentral
(PC) zones. Glucagon synergizes with Ca2+ to promote PP glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibit PC
de novo lipogenesis. Our data show that short-term HFD attenuates NE-induced Ca2+ signaling in hepatocytes
and impairs the propagation of intralobular Ca2+ waves in intact perfused liver. PP hepatocytes specialize in
gluconeogenesis, whereas PC hepatocytes are the primary site of lipogenesis and the first to show steatosis in
NAFLD. We propose that this early lesion in Ca2+ signaling is responsible for the loss of Ca2+-dependent inhibition
of lipogenesis selectively in PC hepatocytes. The present studies build on the unique expertise of the
investigators and several experimental tools developed by the team. The aims to be investigated are:
1. Identify the molecular mechanisms by which HFD suppresses Ca2+ signaling. We will investigate the
role of novel Protein Kinase C (nPKC) isoforms in suppressing Ca2+ signaling by negative feedback on hormone-
induced IP3 generation. In vivo knockdown and direct manipulation of nPKC isoforms will test the hypothesis that
HFD impairs Ca2+ signaling through constitutive activation of nPKC as a consequence of lipid accumulation,
giving rise to a self-sustaining cycle of progressive steatosis.
2. Investigate zonal differences in Ca2+ signaling and how they are affected by HFD. We will examine the
effect of feeding HFD on the zonal organization of Ca2+ signaling in intact liver perfused with Ca2+-dependent
hormones, and how this modifies the synergistic regulation of hepatic metabolism by glucagon. In addition,
isolated hepatocytes will be zonally stratified to elucidate mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling dysfunction.
3. Test whether HFD affects zonal regulation of metabolism by Ca2+ to promote pericentral lipogenesis.
We will determine the effect of HFD on the zonal regulation of key enzymes of lipid metabolism by Ca2+-linked
hormones. We will also investigate the effects of HFD on mitochondrial Ca2+ signals and the lobular organization
of mitochondrial metabolism."

Mitral valve disease is a common underrecognized disorder affecting over 170 million individuals worldwide,
however a sizable proportion of individuals will experience adverse myocardial response leading to degenerative
mitral regurgitation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, or even sudden cardiac death. Myocardial remodeling
responding to mitral regurgitation can lead to changes in cardiovascular structure and function, but general
patterns of change during early disease (such as diastolic dysfunction and increased sphericity) are insufficient
to distinguish between appropriate compensated myocardial response to innocent mitral valve prolapse vs. early
manifestations of future symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation associated with adverse outcomes.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), when applied to biomedical images, indicate that deep learning
algorithms can both offer precise measurements beyond human fidelity and also identify subtle traits in imaging
that are unrecognized by the human eye. Our prior work applying AI to echocardiography as well as others
applying AI to other forms of medical imaging, have shown deep learning can not only reproduce standard
measures of cardiac structural and function but is also identify CVD risk features including chronologic age,
biological sex, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. In effect, AI applied to echocardiography now offers the
potential to capture a precise phenotyping of mitral valve disease, characterize myocardial response, aggregate
risk of future comorbidity and, in turn, identify intervenable target for mitigating future CVD risk. Thus, we
hypothesize that AI methods applied to echocardiography can be used to not only precisely characteristics mitral
valve disease by (i) automating the phenotyping of mitral regurgitation severity, systolic dysfunction, diastolic
parameters, and other measures of adverse myocardial response that demonstrate trajectories of accelerated
versus delayed cardiovascular risk, (ii) discern key contributors to accelerated cardiovascular risk in mitral valve
disease, and (iii) be used on large clinical cohorts to identify clinical underdiagnosis. To test these hypotheses,
we will leverage echocardiography images that are acquired as a part of routine clinical care in addition to serial
imaging frequently obtained in large cohort studies of aging adults. Because healthcare cohorts are enriched for
patients with accelerated and high risk trajectories, while epidemiologic cohorts are enriched for individuals with
delayed and low risk trajectories, we plan to analyze imaging and outcomes data collected from both types of
cohorts. Accordingly, our aims are to train and validate AI models on phenotyping mitral valve disease from
cardiac imaging and identify its component contributors to excess cardiovascular risk in both the healthcare
setting and in the community setting."
10859971,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease afflicting millions of
Americans. At present, most AD treatments only manage symptoms, but don’t slow the underlying progression
of the disease. The root cause of dementia in AD is degeneration and death of neurons important for cognitive
function. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway involved in controlling
organ size. While this pathway is normally studied in the context of a regulatory mechanism of cell proliferation
and development, it has also been shown to be a potent regulator of cell survival. Under circumstances where
Hippo signaling activity is attenuated, transcription co-activator YAP and TAZ enter the nucleus and form a
complex with TEAD. This allows YAP and TAZ to up-regulate pro-proliferative and pro-survival genes. However,
under conditions where Hippo signaling activity is elevated, a cascade of signaling events results in activation of
LATS1 and LATS2, which then phosphorylate YAP and TAZ and tag them for sequestration and/or degradation,
leading to reduced YAP and TAZ activity. Recently, abnormal activation of Hippo signaling has been implicated
in neurodegenerative diseases. We have obtained preliminary data suggesting that Hippo signaling is hyper-
activated in AD. In addition, we have shown that inhibition of Hippo signaling by genetic ablation of Lats1 and
Lats2 genes in forebrain neurons improved cognition and reduced neurodegeneration in AD mouse model
5xFAD mice. Moreover, we have gathered data indicating that inhibition of Hippo signaling increased neurons’
resilience against ferroptosis, an iron-dependent and lipid peroxidation-driven mode of cell death. This study
aims to examine the effectiveness of inhibition of Hippo signaling pathway through genetic approaches at
asymptomatic and symptomatic stages in slowing AD onset and progression. The current study will also
interrogate the underlying mechanism of increased resilience against ferroptosis in neurons conferred by
inhibition of Hippo signaling. Our study seeks to fill the significant gap-of-knowledge on the significance of hyper-
activation of Hippo signaling pathway in AD, and to provide the first proof-of-concept evidence on inhibition of
the Hippo signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD."
10840920,"Project Summary/Abstract
Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs without cure. Repetitive allergen exposure in the
airway leads to the generation of pathogenic immune memory and the excessive production of allergen specific
IgE antibodies that mediate inflammation, airway constriction and respiratory distress in patients with allergic
asthma. Memory B cells are a key component of immune memory. The phenotypic and functional heterogeneity
of MBCs affords their differential antibody responses as well as impact their trafficking, tissue retention and ability
to disseminate systemically. In a mouse model of allergic lung inflammation, we have observed stable lung-
localized MBCs and evidence for the generation of pathogenic antibody responses in sensitized lungs. We
hypothesize that after local antigen sensitization, the lung acquires immune functions reminiscent of those in
secondary lymphoid tissues, capable of maintaining long-lived memory B cells as well as generating new MBCs
that can recirculate and disseminate in other tissues to mediate systemic allergic inflammation. In this study, we
will 1) probe the development of memory B cells (MBCs) in allergic lungs including in-depth characterization of
the critical MBC subset that contributes to allergen specific IgE response, and 2) how these MBCs disseminate
systemically. We will also 3) explore strategies to intercept the systemic dissemination of pathogenic MBCs to
halt the progression of allergic inflammation. These studies will advance our fundamental understanding of
memory B cells as well as help devise new therapeutic strategies for allergic asthma."

 There has been critical underinvestment in Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and continuing to rely on
the same approaches is not working. In this proposal, we actively seek to support disruptive innovations to
stem the rising tide of SUDs and stimulate progress. Such disruptions are most likely to come from those
actively engaged in treating and advancing knowledge of SUDs. But many in a position to do so are not aware
of or see value in discovery commercialization. Our overarching goals are to have more basic scientists think
like entrepreneurs and to have access to the resources they need to engage in the commercialization
processes. Through our proposed tasks, we will develop and deliver entrepreneurship education that is curated
for basic science researchers, empowering them with the tools they need to commercialize their discoveries,
disruptively innovate, and advance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SUDs.
 The Discovery to Commercialization Program for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment
(D2C: SAPT) curriculum will be systematically developed, implemented, and evaluated during this 5-year grant
period. The cornerstone of the proposed initiative is a new Certificate in Entrepreneurship at the Johns
Hopkins University Carey Business School (Aim 2). This program will leverage our experience in teaching
entrepreneurship to scientists at Johns Hopkins and be customized to SUD researchers. The asynchronous
online modules developed for the certificate program will be distributed widely (Aim 1), and through our
educational efforts we will intentionally build (Aim 3) and diversify (Aim 4) the community that can support
translation of discovery to market and impact SUDs.
 This will be a specialized program for SUD researchers aimed at scientists at all career levels that is
grounded in theoretical frameworks and complemented by professional education related to entrepreneur
identity formation and community building. D2C: SAPT will comprise three parts: asynchronous modules
consisting of topics in ideation, market discovery, intellectual property, regulatory strategy, business, and
financial modeling, an in-person multi-day workshop comprising observations in SUD clinics, conversations
with stakeholders, design, and prototyping, and a mentored experiential learning component culminating in a
pitch competition. Program graduates will be equipped to apply for translational funding, patents, and to license
intellectual property or launch companies. More broadly, they will be part of a large virtual community of
researchers and practitioners and will play a role in transforming the culture of academic scientists. With a
keen understanding of the gaps that exist in the SUD field, the types of innovations that are possible, and the
process needed to train scientists in moving their discoveries to market, this training program will have
substantial public health impact by facilitating the launch of projects that move clinical practice in SUD to the
next generation of solutions."
10840927,"Project Summary
Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in older adults and associated with a 5-fold increased risk
of cardioembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) can reduce this risk by ~70%, but nearly 50% of such older
patients are not anticoagulated, with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) being among the
leading cited reasons, attributed to a higher risk of falls, medication errors, and poor adherence. Since the vast
majority of thrombus formation in AF occurs in the left atrial appendage, transcatheter left atrial appendage
occlusion (LAAO) has been approved in the US since 2015 as a one-time procedural alternative treatment for
stroke prevention in AF patients with high risks of complications from OACs. The uptake of transcatheter LAAO
has been growing at a rate of 2 to 3-fold yearly, and it is clearly changing the prescribing pattern of OACs in AF
patients. However, our pilot data showed persons living with dementia (PLWDs) are significantly less likely to
receive transcatheter LAAO when it is indicated. One likely barrier is that PLWDs and frail older adults were
much under-represented in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which led to transcatheter LAAO approval.
Also, several high-risk characteristics prevalent in PLWDs, including frailty, dementia severity, fall risks, and
advanced kidney disease, are risk factors for both the transcatheter LAAO procedure-related complications and
bleeding risks from OACs, complicating the prescribing decisions. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate
the net clinical benefit, weighing the benefits of stroke prevention against the major bleeding and procedure
complications, comparing transcatheter LAAO with specific OACs in PLWDs. Our objective is to establish a
prospective monitoring program in 3 large national healthcare utilization databases (Medicare, IBM Marketscan,
and Optum claims data, covering ~15 million lives) from 2015-2025, linked to electronic health records (EHR).
We will evaluate treatment outcomes of transcatheter LAAO vs. specific OACs in PLWDs with AF with detailed
treatment effect heterogeneity evaluation by frailty, dementia severity, fall risks, advanced kidney disease, and
patient-reported and family factors. We will also determine the utilization trends, predictors, and barriers of
transcatheter LAAO and OACs in PLWDs, using a novel signal detection tool, TreeScan, developed by the
applicant team and adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration for prospective drug safety monitoring.
Our central hypothesis is that transcatheter LAAO has a favorable long-term net clinical benefit compared with
OACs in PLWDs and the relative benefits vary by specific identifiable clinical factors. This proposal will yield: 1)
direct benefit-to-risk data to inform the use of transcatheter LAAO and specific OACs for stroke prevention in
PLWDs with AF; 2) a novel and generalizable prospective monitoring program that compares effectiveness and
safety of newly marketed medical devices vs. pharmacotherapies in PLWDs with detailed treatment effect
heterogeneity evaluation."
10840982,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goals of our laboratories are to understand the biological functions of polycystin proteins (PC1
and PC2) encoded by autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) genes PKD1 and PKD2, and to
determine the pathogenic pathways when they are mutated. By so doing, we seek to establish a firm mechanistic
understanding of the ADPKD pathogenesis, which can be used to guide the rational development of therapies.
A great obstacle to the development of effective ADPKD therapies has been the lack of a precise understanding
of polycystins’ key biological function and how its malfunction initiates and drives the disease process. We have
most recently discovered that the complex formed by PC1 and PC2 (PC1/PC2), with both of proteins lining the
channel pore, functions as a calcium-permeable ion channel, in contrast to the homomeric PC2 channel which
primarily conducts sodium and potassium. This finding indicates that the polycystin complex gains unique ion
channel properties from the assembly of PC1 and the resulting PC1/PC2 channel plays a key role in kidney
physiology and ADPKD. In this multi-PI application, we will use our newly developed gain-of-function (GOF)
PC1/PC2 channel mutant to determine how the PC1/PC2 ion channel function is regulated at a molecular level
by extracellular and intracellular domains and how Ca2+ plays a role in this regulation. We will develop a new
ADPKD mouse model that is defective in PC1/PC2 ion channel function and use it to determine that the channel
function is essential for proper kidney development and inactivation of this function is the real culprit for ADPKD.
To determine whether enhancing the PC1/PC2 ion channel function can be used as a therapeutic strategy, we
will develop another new mouse model with the GOF of PC1/PC2 channel function and use it to determine that
it can rescue the disease in a PKD1 mutant mouse that mimics human ADPKD. We anticipate that the proposed
studies will provide new insights into the fundamental molecular mechanism of function and regulation of the
PC1/PC2 channel and define its channel function as the key determinant of ADPKD. Overall, the project will
likely lead to a better understanding of normal kidney development, reveal the primary culprit for developing
ADPKD when PC1 or PC2 are mutated, and help form the basis for targeting the PC1/PC2 channel for
preventative and therapeutic purposes."
10841629,"SUMMARY
Many of the 100 billion neurons in the human central nervous system require a protective and insulating
coating called myelin to function properly. Loss or damage of this myelin coating underlies many neurological
disorders and therefore regeneration of new myelin is an important part of improving health for patients with
multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and other myelin diseases such as the pediatric
leukodystrophies. Without myelin, certain nerve cells cannot properly conduct electrical impulses, leading to
weakness, fatigue, loss of vision, cognitive decline, and physical incapacity. We have developed a novel
regenerative approach to identify important new potential treatments for patients with myelin loss or
dysfunction that is built upon our expertise in stem cell biology. Our overall goal is to utilize the in vitro mouse
and human stem cell platforms that we have developed to define the central mechanisms responsible for
preventing myelin development and function across the full range of myelin disorders. We seek to discover
novel therapeutic interventions that can modulate the function or regeneration of oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes to restore myelination and neurological function. For multiple sclerosis, we have already defined a
central mechanism to stimulate myelin regeneration and identified potent small molecules that can reverse
paralysis in mouse models of disease. Moving forward, we seek to leverage our innovative technologies and
experience in multiple sclerosis to identify disease- and context-specific effectors of myelin dysfunction and
provide the basis for new therapies."
10841491,"Delirium is a common, serious, and often fatal disorder, affecting up to 60% of hospitalized seniors, and
costing over $164 billion per year. The significance of delirium is heightened in Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD), where it occurs with increased frequency (4-5 fold risk) and severity, compared to those
without ADRD. Delirium severity is directly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, and its measurement is
essential to stratify risk, target treatments, and monitor as an outcome for pathophysiologic studies and clinical
trials. In our successful first cycle, we developed a new 17-item instrument for DELirium Severity, the DEL-S.
 With this proposal, we will extend this work with the novel concept that measurement of delirium severity
should be distinct among persons with and without ADRD. Preexisting ADRD is well-known to lead to
substantial over-estimation of delirium severity, and none of the >40 current delirium severity instruments were
specifically developed or validated for use in persons with ADRD. Thus, our specific aims are: (1) to identify
key items that assess the important domains of delirium severity among persons with ADRD, and to develop a
new instrument, the DEL-S-AD (DELirium Severity in ADRD); (2) to conduct a multi-site prospective cohort
study of 500 older adults (225 with CDR of 0, 50 with CDR of 0.5, and 225 with CDR 1-2) for validation of both
the DEL-S and DEL-S-AD with a simultaneous reference standard rating; and (3) to compare the performance
of the DEL-S and DEL-S-AD across different levels cognitive function, ranging from normal cognition to
moderate ADRD. We will also harmonize DEL-S and DEL-S-AD scores, providing a framework to compare
results on a unified metric. For these aims, we will focus on clarifying the construct of delirium severity in
ADRD using our prior data and an expert panel. Second, we will validate distinct delirium severity instruments
for those with and without ADRD in a multi-site cohort drawn from 3 unique yet complementary sites (BASIL II)
with 500 older adults (225 with ADRD), who will be enrolled from medical and surgical populations, and long-
term care. All participants will also have concurrent evaluation by skilled clinicians for a reference standard
assessment, and all final diagnoses will be made by an experienced, interdisciplinary Adjudication Team.
Performance of each instrument will be assessed for internal reliability, face and content validity, convergent
validity (against legacy instruments), criterion validity (against reference standard) and predictive validity for
relevant clinical outcomes. Finally, we will compare and harmonize the DEL-S and DEL-S-AD scores, to test
whether the DEL-S will have superior performance in those with normal cognition or very mild degrees of
cognitive impairment, and whether the DEL-S-AD will perform best in those with mild to moderate ADRD.
 This application will catalyze a paradigm shift in how delirium severity is measured in persons with and
without ADRD. This work will yield the first validated instrument specifically for delirium severity in ADRD, and
ultimately will help to advance our pathophysiologic understanding and testing of effective new treatments."

Humans regenerate tissue of the brain and spinal cord poorly. Failure to regenerate
missing or damaged cells impedes survival and recovery after neurodegenerative
disease, stroke, traumatic or ischemic injury, or developmental error. Unlike humans,
other animals can effectively repair dramatic injuries or damage within the central
nervous system. Free-living freshwater flatworms called planarians possess
extraordinary regenerative abilities, including flawless regeneration and replacement of
all brain and nerve cord tissues. After tissue loss or damage, planarians remodel
existing tissue and use adult pluripotent stem cells to replace diverse cell types,
including dozens of types of neurons. Planarians create neurons in appropriate ratios
and then repattern and reconnect neurons to targets to restore function. The long-term
goal is to discover the molecular and cellular basis of robust neural regeneration using
planarians. Toward that objective, the first specific aim is to identify and characterize
factors important for regenerative neurogenesis from pluripotent stem cells, focusing
first on regeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Four transcription factor-encoding genes
important for regeneration and maintenance of dopaminergic neuron subtypes have
already been discovered. The following specific aims will provide critical information
about how environmental cues promote brain regeneration by pluripotent stem cells in
vivo. The second specific aim is to test the hypothesis that neurogenesis is upregulated
in planarians after injury, through wound-induced signaling mechanisms. The third
specific aim is to test the hypothesis that planarian neurogenesis is driven by polarity
cues so that new neurons of the correct types are created in the proper locations. The
proposed work in this application is conceptually innovative because of the use of a
highly regenerative model organism to explore regenerative neurogenesis and because
of the development of new molecular and behavioral assays (e.g. DAP-Seq, live prey
assays). The proposed research is significant because it will provide a foundational
understanding of successful neural regeneration in response to injury, with a long-term
goal of identifying pathways or molecular mechanisms that could be leveraged to
improve human regenerative therapies."

The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global
pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack
several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The
host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging
from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical
role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV
pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of
the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our
experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.
 Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV
response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that
integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our
heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and
IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1
drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for
modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental
testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data
to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify
genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.
 Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate
immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein,
while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial
cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network
model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test
pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.
 Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of
gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable.
This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms
driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy."

While the fungus Candida albicans has largely been studied as a pathogen, its primary lifestyle is as a
commensal on mucosal surfaces, including the oral cavity. Microorganisms that occupy mucosal surfaces are
critical for appropriately tuning immune responses to ensure efficient responses to invading pathogens while
limiting responses directed towards host tissues. In this context, commensal fungi play important roles in host
immunity and inflammation. For instance, C. albicans colonization induces cross-reactive T cells and innate
memory in immune cells, a mechanism termed trained immunity. Accumulating evidence from our group and
others have convincingly demonstrated that oral commensal colonization with C. albicans induces specific
immune responses, therefore contributing to mucosal immune system plasticity. However, the fundamental
immunological consequences of oral C. albicans colonization are still not well understood. Host tissues maintain
traces or memory after microorganism encounter that extend beyond adaptive responses of T and B cells. These
changes include profound structural remodeling and epigenetic alterations. ‘Structural immunity’, the immune
response within a tissue framework created by structural cells, such as endothelial and epithelial cells, is
essential for maintaining tolerance and the development of appropriate protective and controlled immune
responses. In probing for structural processes that maintain effective mucosal immunity in the oral cavity, we
identified two mechanisms which are tuned during oral commensal C. albicans colonization, oral epithelial
proliferation and angiogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that commensal C. albicans exposure in the oral cavity
establishes mucosal ‘structural immunity’ by inducing oral epithelial trained immunity, epithelial remodeling, and
angiogenesis. These tissue remodeling and innate priming events serve to maintain effective mucosal immunity,
thus preventing oral fungal outgrowth of this important commensal organism. This proposal will evaluate the
molecular mechanisms by which oral commensal C. albicans induce epithelial proliferation (Aim 1), and
angiogenesis (Aim1 and 2). In Aim1 we will delineate the role of IL-22 in mediating oral structural immunity in
response to commensal C. albicans colonization. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of VEGF as a mediator of
trained and structural immunity in the oral cavity."

We are submitting this application in the program area of Pharmacological Sciences (PS). The primary goal of
the PhD Training Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (MPET) in the Mayo
Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (MCGSBS) is the development of independent investigators
capable of directing outstanding research programs in academia, industry, or other settings. The faculty is
comprised of 28 well-funded, independent investigators who are drawn from departments and divisions across
the institution and who focus on a continuum of research areas encompassing studies from basic molecular
and genetic aspects of disease through drug discovery and development of novel therapies for diseases. The
faculty provides training opportunities in areas that include systems pharmacology, artificial intelligence,
computational chemistry, molecular mechanisms of drug action and resistance, metabolomics, novel
therapeutic strategies, the genetics of addiction, preclinical and clinical pharmacology, and pharmacogenomics
of genes associated with drug responses. Forty-six predoctoral students (PhD and MD/PhD in PhD training),
from diverse backgrounds, are currently enrolled in the MPET PhD training program. A rigorous didactic
curriculum includes a series of Core Curriculum courses that ensures strong fundamental knowledge in
biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, statistics, cell biology and pharmacology as well as a series of
tutorial-based courses that provide advanced training in pharmacological sciences. During their first two years
of study, students complete laboratory rotations and select a laboratory for their thesis research. They
complete comprehensive written and oral qualifying examinations by the end of Year 3. Training in rigor and
reproducibility is woven throughout the training program and students are expected to meet the highest
standards of scientific integrity. After developing a written thesis proposal delineating the questions and
approaches to be pursued in the thesis research, the Thesis Advisory Committee reviews the proposed
research at the first committee meeting. Students present work-in-progress updates on their research projects
to MPET faculty and students each year. Trainees are required to develop independence and to publish at
least one first-author article. In the last 15 years, MPET trainees have averaged over 2.2 first-author articles
and 5.6 total articles). Starting in Year 3 and beyond, students meet with their Thesis Advisory Committees at
least twice per year. The average time to completion of the PhD is 5.9 years. Graduates of the MPET PhD
training program have outstanding track records, with many students establishing new research directions that
have long-lasting impacts on the mentor’s research programs. They go on to postdoctoral fellowships, with
many now serving as principal investigators in academia and industry. We request 6 T32-funded positions."
10840544,"“Exploringthe pathophysiology of CMT1G” 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth
126,000
disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting an estimated
individuals in the U.S. and 2.6 million people worldwide. CMT affects both sensory and motor nerves
in the peripheral nervous system. In patients with CMT, peripheral nerves slowly degenerate resulting in muscle
weakness and atrophy in the limbs as well as neuropathic pain. There is no cure for CMT, but physical and
occupational therapies, braces and other orthopedic devices, and orthopedic surgery may help with the disabling
symptoms of the disease. In addition, pain-relief drugs can be prescribed for severe nerve pain.
 One subtype of CMT, CMT1G, is caused by dominant mutations in the Pmp2 gene, , encoding for a fatty
acid chaperone specifically expressed in Schwann cells, including the in-frame deletion (p.Ile50del) which was
associated to a severe and early onset demyelinating CMT1 disease.
In this project, we propose to examine how the mutation (p.Ile50del) in Pmp2 mouse gene causes a
demyelinating CMT1 disease. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a faithful knock-in mouse
model of CMT1G. We will then investigate two possible pathological gain-of-function. First, , like in some other
CMTs, CMT1G-related mutations could lead to aberrant protein folding, stability and localization of PMP2 and
be detrimental to Schwann cell functions. Second, we will investigate the possibility that the Pmp2 p.Ile50del
mutation alters the fatty acid chaperone function of PMP2 and impair fatty acid uptake in Schwann cells, limiting
myelin biosynthesis.
 Determining whether the in-frame deletion mutation (p.Ile50del) alters PMP2 folding, stability, fatty acid
binding properties, fatty acid uptake and myelin lipid biosynthesis will further our understanding of the molecular
dysregulation associated to PMP2 mutations in CMT1G and offer core foundation for future investigations to test
the direct effect of those molecular dysregulations in the pathophysiology of CMT1G."
10842237,"Insects are the most abundant class of animals, next to vertebrates. For example, the biomass of
termites alone equals that of humans, the most abundant mammal. There are about 1 million named insect
species and approximately another 5 million yet to be classified, compared to about 66,000 species of
vertebrates. While overall beneficial to our ecosystem, some insects have considerable negative impact on
human health. Disease vectors, mostly flies and mosquitoes, are major transmitter of microbes that cause
devasting human diseases, including yellow fever, dengue, malaria and zika. These insect vectors kill close
to a million people each year, sicken hundreds of millions more and incur billions of dollars annually in costs
for treatment and lost productivity. Other insect species are agricultural pests and consume crops and fruits
of cultivated plants, leading to famine in many parts of the world. In light of these facts, a better
understanding of insect biology and behavior, in particular chemosensory behavior, is paramount for
developing specific and effective strategies for population control of harmful pests.
 Drosophila melanogaster, with its array of experimental tools, is uniquely suited to uncover the basic
principles underlying these behaviors. Like mammals and other insects, Drosophila depend on
chemosensory systems to navigate their external world appropriately. The sense of taste is particularly
important to identify food sources and avoid harmful chemicals. To assure that all essential food chemicals
are consumed, insects have evolved appetitive taste receptors for the three major macronutrients, proteins,
carbohydrates and fats. Intriguingly, Drosophila larvae, in contrast to adult flies, can also sense
ribonucleosides and RNA in their food. These chemicals represent an essential resource required to support
rapid growth and survival during the fast-growing larval stages. Larvae employ a small number of closely
related taste receptors, the Gustatory Receptors (Grs) 28 to detect these chemicals. The Gr28 genes are
among the most conserved insect taste receptor genes, homologs of which are found in all insect genomes,
from flour beetles to honeybees to mosquitoes. These observations suggest that the Gr28 genes have a
conserved role, namely to detect RNA and ribonucleosides in insects. Remarkably, some of the Gr28 genes
have been implicated in temperature and light sensing, expanding their role to sensory pathways beyond
taste. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the function of receptors for RNA and ribonucleosides is of
considerable interest, especially because they are broadly conserved in diverse insect species, from
disease vectors (mosquitoes and flies), to agricultural pests (beetles, grasshoppers) and ecologically
beneficial pollinators (honeybees). Exploiting the ability of insects to sense RNA and ribonucleosides via
specific taste receptors may provide new opportunities to develop strategies for control of harmful insects."
10842238,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.
and untreated infections are a major cause of adverse sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease,
infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Screening programs have failed to curb rising infection rates. As most
infections in women are asymptomatic and screening is only recommended annually, the incidence of CT is
likely higher than reported. While antibiotic therapy is curative, successful biomedical prevention strategies are
lacking. Most CT natural history studies evaluate CT in the short 1-2 week interval between screening and
follow-up for treatment. Few studies have had longer follow-up. Overall, these studies suggest spontaneous
clearance of CT (in the absence of antibiotic treatment) occurs in 11-44% of cases; however, the mechanisms
are poorly understood. The vaginal microbiome (VMB) is a major factor in preventing CT acquisition, and the
VMB may also aid in CT clearance by reducing CT proliferation and promoting effective immune responses.
Thus, identifying modifiable vaginal microenvironmental features that play a role in spontaneous clearance of
CT may lead to novel interventions. This proposal is submitted in response to PA-19-096 “Control of
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) Through a Comprehensive Understanding of the Natural History
of Infection”. We propose to investigate the relations between spontaneous CT clearance and VMB
(structure, function, metabolome), mucosal immunity, and CT serovar-specific features. This proposal will
utilize archived cervicovaginal lavage samples collected from the Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which
3,620 cisgender women were followed quarterly for one year. Samples were retrospectively screened for CT
after the study concluded and detected CT spontaneous clearance (n=311) and persistence (n=321)
events. The specific aims utilize a repository with a long follow-up and will assess four domains that may drive
the natural history of CT: 1) demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors, 2) vaginal microbiome and
metabolome, 3) mucosal soluble markers of inflammation, 4) CT serovar composition. Our experienced, multi-
disciplinary team will adapt, refine, and apply modern methods in longitudinal epidemiology with machine-
learning and dimension-reduction techniques to assess high-dimensional, multi-omic data. We seek to identify
immunologic, metabolomic, and bacterial candidates that are associated with spontaneous CT clearance. This
epidemiologic study of over 600 archived samples presents the best available resource for identifying likely
natural clearance and persistence mechanisms. Findings from the analyses would provide the cost-benefit
justification for future confirmatory trials and experimental mechanistic studies. The results may lead to new CT
vaccine approaches by pinpointing correlates of protection against clinically-relevant serovars and informing
choice of adjuvants for optimal immune response. The data may also aid the design of antibiotic-sparing
approaches, such as live biotherapeutic formulations, which could enhance CT control programs."

 HLA-F is a nonclassical class I MHC (Ib) molecule that has been found expressed on a variety of cancers,
shown to play a role in HIV and adenoviral infection, the neurological autoimmune disease ALS and is expressed
throughout pregnancy. Despite the potential importance of this protein in these conditions, little is known about
this molecule in terms of its function or even in which conformational state it is expressed. We have recently
shown that, in addition to being expressed as a heavy chain only state, or open conformer (HLA-FOC), HLA-F
can also be expressed as a bon fide peptide presenting molecule, associated with the β2m subunit (pHLA-F).
Peptides are presented in an unconventional way, with the N-terminus not anchored within the groove and the
potential for post-translational modifications featuring in peptide anchoring. Despite these advances, there
remains much unknown about how these conformer states are regulated, how it engages its various receptors
in each of these conformer states, and the role of HLA-F in its various environments of tumor surveillance,
autoimmunity and reproduction. Thus, the aims of this proposal focus on addressing these questions and are:
Aim 1: To investigate, structurally and functionally, the various conformer states that HLA-F adopts in
human health and disease. We will pursue structural studies of the HLA-F isoforms to understand how these
two states differ from each other. Using conformer-specific antibodies, we will determine what cell types express
which (or both) forms and how this differs between healthy and disease cells. We will also pursue peptide elution
studies from a range of human sources to determine if the peptide repertoire shifts depending on cellular origin
or disease. Aim 2: To identify and analyze the factors that regulate the production or interchange of HLA-
F conformers and splice forms in a cell. We will explore the cellular factors that may play a role in switching
HLA-F between peptide-loaded and HLA-FOC as well as an intriguing splice variant of HLA-F of unknown function.
Finally, in Aim 3 we seek to establish the receptor repertoire that engage HLA-F in its various conformer
states, determine the molecular basis for their association and study the functional consequences of
their binding. We will employ the structural, biophysical and functional expertise of the Adams lab to determine
the receptor repertoire that engage these conformer states of HLA-F and study them at the functional and
molecular level."

The majority of the 300,000 annual deaths worldwide from prostate cancer are strongly attributed to bone
metastasis because the skeleton is the exclusive site of clinical disease in the majority of men with advanced
illness. There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underpin the efficient and life-
threatening colonization of the bone microenvironment by prostate cancer cells. Our long-term goal is to
develop novel therapeutic strategies based on a molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of bone
metastases in order to significantly improve survival and quality of life outcomes in prostate cancer. Our
laboratory studies implicate two different but functionally related integrins expressed by prostate cancer cells in
their homing, survival and lethal spread within the bone microenvironment. The rationale of this study is that a
bispecific antibody that simultaneously targets these 2 integrins would optimally neutralize their function via its
cross-linking mechanism of action and deliver an efficacious therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, a first-in-class
bispecific antibody targeting these integrins demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to
monospecific antibodies alone or in combination. A distinct molecular mechanism of action for the bispecific
antibody was defined. Following treatment with either or both monospecific integrin antibodies, adaptive
upregulation of the integrins was seen whereas by contrast, downregulation of integrins followed bispecific
antibody treatment via induction of internalization and lysosomal degradation of integrins. Our hypothesis is
that the bispecific integrin antibody will halt the life-threatening progression of prostate cancer in the bone
microenvironment. We plan to evaluate this hypothesis with three specific aims. First, we plan to assess the
efficacy of the bispecific antibody compared to monospecific antibodies in distinct animal models of bone
metastases that replicate key dimensions of the clinical disease: seeding of the bone marrow, interaction with
human bone-derived stromal cells, accelerated growth and secondary dissemination from bone, and finally,
generation of an osteoblastic phenotype. Secondly, we will further define the mechanism of action of the
bispecific integrin antibody by assessing its impact on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, anoikis and
clonogenic survival. Finally, we will determine the organ-specificity of the expression of the two integrins by
comparing the expression of these integrins in bone metastases from prostate cancer and other solid tumors to
metastases found in lymph nodes and visceral organs. Our innovative therapeutic strategy to disable the
molecular mechanisms of colonization of the bone microenvironment by prostate cancer is significant because
it has the potential to significantly prolong survival and improve quality of life of patients with prostate cancer.
Solid tumors that colonize bone such as breast cancer may leverage the same molecular pathways, expanding
the potential significance and impact of the bispecific antibody strategy in biomarker-supported clinical trials to
follow."

10843141,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The healthcare policy and financing environment since the Affordable Care Act has increased pressure on
hospitals to consolidate into larger hospital systems. Annual hospital merger activity has doubled over the last
decade, and over two-thirds of US hospitals are now part of a hospital system. The presumed benefits of
hospital consolidation include concentrating volume and expertise, care integration, and investment in quality
improvement. If done correctly, they would translate to both quality and cost improvements. The limited data on
hospital system performance shows significant variation in achieving the purported benefits of consolidation.
While hospital consolidation may impact a broad spectrum of service lines, changes to surgical services may
be the most informative. Surgical care has known variation in well-defined outcomes and short-term costs. As
such, surgical care may be a “leading indicator” to understand the effects of hospital consolidation on
healthcare quality and costs. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we propose the following aims:
Aim 1: To examine the relationship between hospital network optimization and outcomes. Using claims
and publicly reported data on an inclusive range of surgical procedures from public and private payers, we will
assess hospital systems on rationalization of site of care, including centralization of complex procedures,
avoidance of low-volume surgery, and selective referral of high-risk patients to tertiary centers. Aim 2: To
examine the relationship between hospital network optimization and healthcare costs. Again using
claims and publicly reported data, we will empirically assess variation between and within hospital systems in
risk-adjusted 30-day episode costs for the same surgical procedures. We will then analyze the relationship
between care rationalization and average system costs as well as within-system cost variation. Aim 3: To
understand characteristics of high-performing networks in order to identify best practices. We will use
qualitative methods to identify effective system strategies not observable in claims data. Using a positive
deviance approach, we will identify hospital systems that exhibit the most longitudinal improvement in
outcomes and costs and perform in-depth interviews of hospital system leaders, reviews of policies and
protocols, and site visits in order to define the differentiating characteristics. Our work will allow policymakers
and the public to evaluate hospital system performance in care rationalization. Our work will also provide
insights that will help hospital system leaders improve the performance of their organizations."
10843143,"The combination of lineage tracing and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in mouse atherosclerosis
models has created a paradigm shift in our understanding of vascular disease, showing that lesion smooth
muscle cells (SMC) undergo phenotypic transitions into derivative cells with multiple complex phenotypes. We
identified TCF21 as a coronary artery disease (CAD) associated gene mapped by genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and showed that this gene regulates a disease-related transition of SMC to a fibroblast like
phenotype, producing cells we term “fibromyocytes.” Further, we and others have shown that medial SMC can
also transition to a second SMC-derived cellular phenotype, characterized by expression of genes known for
their role in endochondral bone formation, substantiating and expanding previous work investigating this
process that is linked to intimal vascular calcification. We showed that this chondrogenic process, which gives
rise to cells we term “chondromyocytes” (CMC), is actively inhibited by two CAD associated genes, one
encoding the TGFB1 signaling molecule SMAD3, and the other encoding the environmental sensing aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Knockout (KO) of both genes in mouse models showed increased transition to
CMC, larger lesion size and increased vascular calcification. These studies identified SOX9 as a primary driver
of the phenotypic transition to the CMC phenotype. Our longterm goal is to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms that mediate the detrimental CMC transition. Our Central Hypothesis postulates that SOX9 is
a key initiator of this chondrogenic process in the vascular wall, as it is in endochondral bone
formation, and regulation of its expression and function in SMC is intimately linked to vascular
calcification and disease risk. Our objective is thus to determine the upstream epigenetic signals that
modulate SOX9 expression, and how SOX9 expression contributes to CMC development and vascular
calcification. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will employ Sox9 KO and SMC lineage tracing in the ApoE KO mouse
atherosclerosis model to characterize the effect of this gene on SMC cell state transitions, and the impact of
perturbing these transitions on disease morphology and cellular anatomy. In Aim 2, we will conduct scRNAseq
in these mice to characterize the SMC gene expression program downstream of Sox9 in this cell type. Single
cell assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) in the same animals will map
enhancers genome-wide that are differentially regulated in CMC phenotypic transition, and identify specific
transcription factors (TFs) that bind these enhancers to regulate expression of CMC genes. Studies proposed
in Aim 3 will employ in vitro studies to characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanism by which
SOX9 interacts with the inhibitory factors SMAD3 and AHR, and novel TFs that promote transition to the CMC
phenotype. The proposed studies will identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate SMC transition
to CMC, and the relationship of this process to vascular calcification and disease risk."

Bone as well as tendons each contain stem cell populations embedded in type I collagen-rich tissues. Bone
marrow and endosteal-derived stem cells generate bone via endochondral ossification while periosteal stem
cells form bone via the intramembranous route. In turn, tendon stem cells give rise to tenocytes that populate
the mature tissues. Recent studies have identified the cysteine proteinase, cathepsin K (CTSK), as a unique
marker of periosteal stem cells, a finding we have confirmed, but that also led to our identification of a heretofore
uncharacterized second stem population associated with tendons. In bone marrow-derived MSCs, we have
previously identified a novel requirement for the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, in
regulating a mechanosensitive, YAP/TAZ-dependent pathway that controls stem cell lineage commitment via
the proteolytic remodeling of the pericellular collagen matrix. By contrast, the relative roles of MT1-MMP and
CTSK in periosteal or tendon/ligament stem cells are unknown. Using a Ctsk-Cre transgenic line to target
periosteal stem cells, we find that Mt1-mmp targeting alone elicits a profound osteopenic state in vivo that not
only operates independently of Ctsk, but also redirects the stem cells to an aberrant hyperproliferative,
chondrogenic state. Further, and unexpectedly, Ctsk-Cre–dependent targeting of MT1-MMP - but not Ctsk,
disrupts tendon/ structure by altering a previously undescribed paratenon stem cell-tendon trafficking route. In
vivo, MT1-MMP-null tendon stem cells commit to a hyperproliferative, chondrogenic phenotype similar to that
observed following tendon/ligament trauma. Based on these new data, we propose that MT1-MMP controls
each of these stem cell populations by regulating a mechanotransduction pathway that not only controls
YAP/TAZ-linked co-transcriptional programs, but also canonical TFGβ signaling pathways via the proteolytic
shedding of the accessory TGFβ receptor, TGFβRIII. Together, these findings outline a new model of MSC
function wherein MT1-MMP-dependent collagenolysis and receptor shedding together play a required role in
periosteal tissues and tendons. As such, we propose 3 aims; i) characterize the role of MT1-MMP in regulating
periosteal stem cell differentiation and function in vitro and in vivo, ii) define a novel role for Ctsk+ tendon stem
cells in controlling tendon function and its regulation by MT1-MMP and iii) delineate the impact of MT1-MMP on
periosteal/paratenon stem cell YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction and TGFβ/TGFβRIII- dependent differentiation
programs. Together, these aims should cast new light on a family of specialized stem cells that require MT1-
MMP-dependent proteolysis to not only regulate intramembranous bone formation, but also tendon
structure/function as well."
10843147,"Worldwide there are about 617 million people aged 65 or older, and this population continues to increase at an unparalleled rate. According to a report from the United States Census Bureau and commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, the current global population of older individuals of 8.5% is expected to surge to approximately 1.6 billion people, or almost 17% of the world's population, by 2050. The 65-and-over population of the United States is predicted to nearly double over the next three decades, from 48 million to 88 million Although it is well known that age is a risk factor for a variety of acute and chronic disorders, the mechanisms underlying aging, and the best way to minimize the effects of this process on health, are not well understood. Therefore, research into the mechanisms of the aging process and treatment of age-related diseases is critical. In addition, as the American population continues to age, there will be a growing need for physicians trained to care for the elderly and diseases related to aging. Finally, there continues to be a gap in the number of under-represented minorities trained as physicians and physician-scientists. The proposed program will address these issues by providing under-represented minority medical students with the opportunity to participate in aging research and to observe geriatricians in the clinic, with the idea of promoting a sustained interest in this field of medicine and research. The Program for Aging Research in the Summer, or PARIS, will build upon the success of a pilot program initiated as part of the Co-Principal Investigator's P01 Project, which for the past three years has arranged transportation, housing and research mentors for three students from the Puerto Rican medical school, Universidad Central del Caribe (UCC), to pursue aging research with one of the members of the Program Project. This program has gradually received positive publicity from the students, such that this past application period the number of applicants to the program far exceeded the number of slots available. Therefore, in the program described in this application we are proposing to increase the number of slots in the program, as well as to extend the opportunity to participate to medical students from other Puerto Rican medical schools, including Ponce Health Sciences University and San Juan Bautista School of Medicine. The goals of this program are to: (I) organize the participation of under-represented minority medical students in aging research at Augusta University, (II) develop didactic training in research methods and statistics for PARIS trainees, (III) organize a clinical observership for PARIS trainees with physicians caring for older individuals and (IV) establish a mechanism to sustain trainees' interest in aging research and track trainee outcomes. With this program we hope to encourage under-represented minority engagement in careers in geroscience and geriatrics."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studies have shown that the heart can secrete factors including those in extracellular vesicles (EVs)/exosomes
that can induce significant effects both locally to myocardial tissue and distantly to other organs. This includes
adipose tissue where data from our lab has revealed that the heart can secrete substances that can alter
adiposity, especially after a high fat diet (HFD). In fact, specific signals are released after HFD when adrenergic
signaling in myocytes is altered by manipulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) levels and activity
as increased myocyte GRK2 leads to a lean phenotype after HFD and myocyte-specific GRK2 inhibition leads
to an obese phenotype. This has been recapitulated in vitro with conditioned media experiments from myocytes
to cultured differentiating adipocytes. GRK2 regulates β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) in the heart where this
pathway is crucial for normal and compromised cardiac contractility and function. GRK2 is up-regulated in the
heart after cardiac stress, which includes HFD and increased GRK2 leads to compromised βAR signaling and
GRK2 is involved in heart failure (HF) progression. The GRK2-adrenergic signaling axis appears to be important
in the endocrine activity of the heart as well since we have uncovered data over the last cycle of this grant that
manipulation of GRK2 can have profound and significant effects on EV cargo including microRNAs (miRs). We
believe these EV/exosomes secreted from stressed hearts/myocytes with increased GRK2 could participate in
cardiac dysfunction locally. In addition to HFD, GRK2 can be increased in the hearts of mice by ischemic injury
and hypertrophic stress. Previous data and new data in this proposal not only shows that altering GRK2 in the
heart can have profound effects distantly on adipose tissue via what is secreted but also can affect local cardiac
cells in a paracrine fashion. In fact, increased cellular GRK2 results in increased GRK2 in secreted EV/exosomes
including after ischemic injury in vivo and these EVs have detrimental effects when placed on cultured cardiac
cells. Thus, manipulation of GRK2 in myocytes can significantly alter the myocardial secretome that appears to
have profound effects both locally and distantly including new data showing changes in fat depots after cardiac
injury in a sex-specific manner. Specifically, the Central Hypothesis of this proposal is that cardiac stressors,
which alters GRK2 levels and signaling can alter the myocardial secretome including the contents of
EV/exosomes, which can significantly affect myocardial injury and repair as well as influence regulation of distant
organs, especially adipose. Specific Aims are: [1] To identify factor(s) and elucidate novel mechanisms involved
in the communicative signals secreted from GRK2-altered myocardium responsible for regulating systemic
adiposity after HFD; [2] To determine the mechanistic role of altered myocyte GRK2 levels on EV/exosome
content and determine how GRK2’s up-regulation after injury alters EV-mediated myocardial responses; [3] To
determine the role of altered myocyte GRK2 levels and corresponding secreted EV/exosomes on the post-injury
regulation of distant adipose tissue acutely and chronically during HF development."

on health and social, occupational, and emotional well-being of adults. Only 26% of adults have had a diagnostic
hearing test within the past 5 years and delayed hearing loss diagnosis and treatment may lead to communication
impairment with profound effects on education, employment, and overall health. The prevalence of hearing loss
is higher among adults living in rural communities compared with those in urban settings; furthermore, rural
adults with hearing loss may never receive treatment or may be delayed in diagnosis and/or treatment compared
with urban adults. Rural health clinics (RHCs) represent a federally designated health system care that provides
primary care within rural underserved communities; however, hearing healthcare services have not been a
significant component of RHC care delivery. RHCs are ideally positioned to partner with rural communities to
develop an intervention that can help rural adults navigate different aspects of hearing healthcare such as
education, prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The goal of this study is to assess the utilization of
hearing healthcare among rural adults through RHCs with the R21 phase of the program and then develop a
culturally responsive RHC patient navigation program (PNP) to promote utilization of hearing healthcare. To
conduct this study, we will partner with 10 high-need under-resourced RHCs within rural Appalachian counties
in Kentucky and utilize the PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM) to systematically assess the rural adult hearing
health and healthcare priorities, needs, and resources to inform intervention development. During the R21 phase
we will 1) conduct a social and epidemiological assessment of rural adult hearing healthcare and 2) assess the
organizational and environmental factors influencing hearing healthcare utilization in RHCs. The milestones of
the R21 include the determination of the prevalence of hearing loss and hearing healthcare utilization in rural
adults, establishment of rural adult hearing healthcare priorities, and development of a community advisory board
and a rural provider taskforce. During the R33 phase we will 1) develop of a community-based hearing healthcare
patient navigation program for RHCs and 2) pilot test the rural hearing healthcare navigation program. The
milestones of the R33 phase include the development of a PNP protocol, assessment of the impact of the
navigator on rural adults obtaining diagnostic audiogram, and evaluation of the PNP feasibility, acceptability, and
appropriateness. This study is significant because it aims to reduce access to care barriers to timely diagnostic
hearing testing for rural adults to prevent negative consequences. This research is innovative in development
and pilot testing of a novel intervention not previously assessed in adult hearing healthcare within an RHC setting.
Our results will impact the field by partnering with communities to inform the development and delivery of
innovative patient supportive interventions to improve rural hearing healthcare access."

Hearing loss is the second leading impairment worldwide. Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications and
disproportionately affects individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Up to 75% of childhood
hearing loss in LMICs is preventable due to the high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. School hearing
screening is critical for identification of childhood hearing loss in low resource settings, where newborn screening
is unavailable. However, most screening programs only use pure-tone screening that does not identify middle
ear disease widespread in populations with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. This is because
tympanometry, used to clinically identify middle ear disease, is expensive and designed for trained professionals.
Our goal is to develop and validate an mHealth tympanometer with machine learning diagnostic support
to transform this technology into a low-cost tool that could be broadly disseminated in LMICs, where the
burden of hearing loss is greatest and is not addressed by current hearing screening methodology. Our
study team is comprised of international leaders in hearing loss, audiology, data science, engineering, user-
centered design, and device development in LMICs. We have also partnered with hearX, a University of Pretoria
spinout company that developed the only validated mHealth pure-tone screening device. To test this new device
in an appropriate LMIC setting, we have partnered with the South African site from the Global HEAR
Collaborative, our consortium of collaborators from 28 countries that is the only international research network
dedicated to hearing loss. We documented the need for this device in a large cluster randomized trial recently
completed in rural Alaska, where tympanometry significantly improved the accuracy of school hearing screening
in a population with a high prevalence of infection-related hearing loss. Using data from this trial and pilot funding,
we are developing a machine learning tympanometry algorithm for lay screeners, and early hardware prototype
fabrication is underway. In Aim 1, we will refine the hardware prototype using a user-centered design approach,
cyclically incorporating feedback from South African team members during testing in a lab environment. In Aim
2, we will develop software through user-centered design that integrates the machine learning algorithm and
refined hardware prototype. The resulting mHealth tympanometer will advance to the R33 phase. Technology
development will be completed in Aims 3 and 4 through integration of the mHealth tympanometer with existing
health information technology and an early feasibility study in 15 preschool children in South Africa to optimize
device design for lay users. In Aim 5, we will validate the mHealth tympanometer with lay screeners through a
clinical performance study in 500 preschool children in South Africa. This technology, developed through
partnership and testing in an LMIC setting, will empower teachers and community health workers to identify
children at risk for preventable hearing loss. The Global HEAR Collaborative will provide infrastructure for future
studies with the proposed device across LMICs, directly addressing disparities in childhood hearing loss globally."

The NIAID Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE) strives to create a cooperative network intended
to improve the understanding, prevention, and treatment of autoimmune disease. The goal of the ACE is
to conduct insightful analyses using cutting edge human immunology research tools with samples from
ACE Collaborative Centers, especially in the context of Clinical Projects, i.e., clinical trials with integrated
mechanistic studies. It is intended that members of both the basic and clinical ACE will work
synergistically to design, develop, and conduct studies on various autoimmune diagnoses in humans.
Toward this end, cumulative efforts from involved ACE sites will generate an invaluable set of samples
as a resource both for the proposed studies and future experimental questions. Thus, the necessary and
important mission of the ACE Biorepository Core (ABC) is to ensure that samples will be systematically
processed, catalogued and tracked, then appropriately stored and disseminated.
The ABC at WCM is organized as a collective effort with laboratories affiliated with each of the patient
enrollment sites to be determined by the ACE Steering Committee and NIAID. The ABC will operate
under a common set of standard operating procedures, a common data management system, and a
streamlined process for mechanistic laboratories to obtain samples to support experimental aspects of
the ACE Program. Frequent communication across ACE sites, the Steering Committee and NIAID will
ensure timely, accurate, precise and efficient sample coordination. The ABC at WCM will strive to uphold

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by breakdown of
tolerance to nucleic acids (NAs) and widespread inflammation stemming from pathogenic innate
and adaptive immune interactions in genetically susceptible individuals. Clinical and molecular
heterogeneity represent a major challenge and contribute to the long series of failed clinical trials
in SLE. Understanding major disease pathogenic drivers, identifying biomarkers to follow them in
the clinical setting, and stratifying patients for targeted therapies are therefore highly significant
goals to advance clinical trial design and deliver personalized patient care. This is particularly
relevant to patients with childhood-onset SLE (cSLE), who present with a more aggressive
phenotype and overall poorer outcome compared to adult-onset SLE. Our studies, stemming from
three previous ACE cycles, uncovered molecular heterogeneity among cSLE patients which
allowed their stratification based on major disease pathogenic drivers. We also described the
presence in cSLE patients of a novel extra-follicular CD4+ memory T cell subset that provides B
cell help independently of IL21 and CXCL13, thus expanding the spectrum of T helper pathways
in this disease. We then extensively profiled the blood CD4+ T cells compartment of cSLE which
uncovered transcriptomic signatures associated with disease activity (DA) and/or Lupus Nephritis
(LN). Herein, we propose to deconvolute the cSLE CD4+ T cell compartment longitudinally
in patients stratified according to the presence/absence of LN and the response to therapy.
This will help elucidate how both standard of care and B-cell targeting therapies affect the
frequency and function of CD4+ T cells and what basic mechanisms lead to amplification of T
helper pathogenic pathways in SLE. Secondly, we will study functional alterations of cSLE
CD4+ T regulatory cells and their potential connection with the microbiome. Results from
the proposed studies will ultimately help stratify patients and identify therapeutic targets for a
systemic autoimmune disease with a significant track record of clinical trial failure. Completion of
the project goals will lead to a better understanding of these pathways at the phenotypic and
functional levels. Additionally, these studies will identify biomarkers to characterize distinct CD4+
T cell-compartments with unprecedented granularity in blood and tissues, as well as potential
targets to intervene therapeutically in selected patients."

Systemic autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous both clinically and molecularly. Among them, systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) is relatively frequent, affecting ~1:5000 people, with a higher prevalence in
women. Lupus phenotypes are heterogeneous, but robust biomarkers that predict SLE progression, organ
involvement and response to treatment are lacking. One of the fundamental criteria for SLE diagnosis is the
presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), which comprise nucleic acids as well as proteins. Lupus presents
as an interferonopathy, though IL1-b activation is also broadly observed. Given the central role of ANA in
activating and propagating chronic IFN responses, understanding the sources of immunogenic DNA and
mechanisms of IFN activation are critical. Despite their great clinical relevance major questions remain
including how anti-DNA responses are prevented in healthy individuals, whether differences in structure or
levels of DNA are responsible for immunogenicity in SLE and potentially other SAD, and how these
mechanisms could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. We have recently discovered that activated T cell-
derived exosomes (ATexo) carry large amounts of double stranded DNA complexed with histones (exoDNA),
and that ATexo are efficient activators of IFN responses in a DNA-dependent manner. Thus, we hypothesize
that, in SAD patients (SLE, scleroderma), due to anti-DNAse antibodies and DNASE1, DNASE1L3 mutations,
combined with chronic T and B, plasma cell activation and expansion, the amount of circulating exoDNA
exceeds DNA-degrading capacity and DNA-laden exosomes accumulate, chronically activating anti-DNA
responses and leading to chronic inflammation. We propose to isolate and characterize DNA and protein
cargo of T and B cells from healthy controls and SAD subjects, defining the function of activated T, B cell and
plasma cell exoDNA in activating anti-DNA responses in antigen presenting cells and identifying the enzymes
controlling circulating exoDNA levels. Testing this hypothesis will provide a systems-level understanding of
relationships between the clinical, molecular, and functional heterogeneity in SLE and other SADs. By profiling
the cargo of adaptive immune cell exosomes, and investigating, for the first time, the roles of activated immune
cell-derived exoDNA in driving SAD chronic inflammation, these studies will help dissect the pathogenic
mechanisms of the disease and designing novel, personalized treatments. Since exosomes reflect the
systemic status of a disease, and, unlike circulating immune cells, can reflect pathologies associated with
distant organs, often before these changes can be detected by other approaches, they are the ideal biomarker
candidate for heterogeneous, multifactorial, systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases in general and
SLE in particular."

Men continue to be missed by HIV testing and treatment services. Index partner testing is a critical strategy for
reaching men. Index HIV self-testing (HIVST), whereby ART clients take HIVST kits home to their sexual partners
for testing, is a new strategy that dramatically increases index testing among men, and is being taken to scale
across Malawi. However, only 25% of men identified as HIV-positive through Index HIVST initiate ART after 6-
months. Innovative strategies to increase ART initiation and retention among men are urgently needed. The
overarching goal of the proposed R01 is to test a home-based ART intervention (ART initiation + 3-months ART
care) plus motivational interviewing to increase ART initiation and 6-month viral suppression among men who
test HIV-positive through Index HIVST in Malawi. The specific aims are: (1) test the effectiveness of home-based
versus facility-based ART on ART initiation and 6-month viral suppression among male partners who test through
Index HIVST; (2) Identify predictors of ART initiation and 6-month viral suppression; and (3) Determine the cost
and cost-effectiveness of home-based ART versus facility-based among male partners using Index HIVST. The
trial will provide urgent information on innovative HIV service delivery strategies for hard-to-reach-populations,
such as men. Findings are expected to inform national policy and international recommendations around
combined differentiated models that reach across the HIV treatment cascade."

There is a great need to increase academic physician scientists in Newborn Medicine who will perform high
level laboratory, clinical, translational, and health services research to improve our understanding of the
pathobiology of developmental diseases, health disparities, and long-term morbidities. The main objective of
our training program is to train postdoctoral physician scientists by providing a structured, mentored, intensive
research experience to advance our knowledge of developmental diseases and improve short and long-term
health outcomes of children. Equally important, this renewal application requests the resources to continue our
record of training physician scientists to become future national leaders and mentors. The unique fetal and
early postnatal periods of rapid organ growth represent a critical window in which environmental exposures can
result in epigenetic changes that underlie the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases including psychiatric
disorders, cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. There is no other time in the life of a human when
even minor medical interventions can have such a profound impact on long term health, underscoring the need
to train neonatology physician-scientists who can focus on diseases of this critical developmental stage. The
Harvard Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Training Program has a ~ 50-year history of training physician scientists
who now lead national programs in academic neonatology. Historically, most of our graduates (>80%)
continue in academic careers whereas the national average has remained ~35%. We have a large pool of
outstanding eligible applicants combined with a highly accomplished mentoring faculty in the rich scientific
community of Harvard Medical School which allows us to train top candidates in our field. Our 3-year research
and career training program broadly focuses in four areas: 1) The study of molecular, cellular, and epigenetic
mechanisms of normal development and perinatal injury; 2) Investigation in neonatal genomics to uncover the
genetic basis of complex disorders and develop precision medicine-based therapeutic strategies; 3) Clinical
studies using bioinformatic approaches, biomarkers science, clinical trials and health outcomes research; and
4) Innovative imaging of the fetus and newborn, including placental function and hemodynamics. A mentoring
program and scholarship oversight committee is assembled for each trainee to provide mentoring in scientific
and career development. Didactic courses are required for both basic and clinical research training and
supplemented with relevant seminars, a course in the responsible conduct of research, a DEI curriculum on
anti-racism and community advocacy as well as an annual research symposium. Advisory committees of
national experts advise on candidate and mentor selection, scholarly progress, and overall success. We have
a strong history of advancing the career of URiM trainees and multiple strategies are in place for the
recruitment of minority candidates. We are committed to the training of diverse physician scientists who will
move independently into successful careers as investigators and leaders in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine."

Our overall goal in this project is to develop an in-depth understanding of the complex interplay between non-
obstructive sleep apnea (non OSA) sleep disorders and recovery after stroke. Sleep is vital to overall health
and quality of life. Abnormal or insufficient sleep is both a risk factor and consequence of stroke. Sleep also
plays a critical role in motor learning, which is the foundation of rehabilitation strategies after stroke. Although
there is a growing understanding of the interplay between sleep, stroke, and recovery in people with OSA
these complex relationships in individuals post stroke with non OSA sleep disorders are not well understood. In
order to develop targeted sleep interventions to support rehabilitation after stroke and promote optimal
recovery, it is critical to gain a fuller understanding of the prevalence and impact of non OSA sleep disorders in
people with stroke across the continuum of recovery. The specific objectives of this proposal will lay the
necessary groundwork for this as we will characterize the proportion of people with stroke that have insomnia
disorders, restless legs syndrome, and insufficient sleep; and evaluate the impact of these non OSA sleep
disorders on recovery of activities of daily living, mobility/activity, and participation across the continuum of
recovery after stroke. We will take an innovative approach to measuring sleep, mobility/activity, and
participation using a combination of techniques across the measurement spectrum that will include self-report
questionnaires, clinic-based measures of capacity, and body worn sensors. The body worn sensors will include
actigraphy to measure sleep parameters, activity monitors to measure mobility/activity levels, and Global
Positioning System (GPS) units to measure participation. Additionally, we will apply innovative, big data tools
from topological data analysis for a data driven approach to discover complex, structural, non-linear
interdependent relationships among stroke, sleep, and recovery of mobility/activity, and participation. Upon
completion of this study we will understand the prevalence and impact of non-OSA sleep disorders on recovery
of function, mobility/activity, and participation across the continuum of recovery post stroke. This is an
important, necessary step to develop appropriate sleep-based interventions to complement targeted
rehabilitation strategies to enhance the health and quality of life in people with stroke."

The HU-ERA program is designed to select and train a diverse group of recent baccalaureate graduates for
research careers in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), leveraging the well-established HU-
ADAR program and other related initiatives at Howard University. Trainees will be provided with intensive,
mentored research experiences and professional development activities to expand expertise skills relevant to
ADRD-focused biomedical research, including critical thinking, ethical determinations, quantitative and analytical
assessments, and science communication skills; thereby promoting trainees’ self-efficacy and self-identity as
proficient, biomedical researchers. Training activities for each cohort of HU-ERA trainees will span a 2-year cycle.
The main training component is full-time, intensive biomedical research work in an ADRD-focused laboratory,
guided by a dedicated mentor. Additional critical training components include: an Aging Brain course; an
AD/ADAR seminar series; a course on responsible conduct of research and ethics; workshops on various
research-related topics including data interpretation, rigor, and reproducibility; and other professional skill-
building activities. Host research mentors and other participating faculty of the HU-ERA program have rigorous
neuroscience research programs and records of training and mentoring those from diverse cultural, racial
backgrounds, and self-identified orientations. Mentors are motivated to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility in their work and research environments and are aligned with the HU-ERA program mission to
increase underrepresented minority representation in the ADRD biomedical research workforce and leadership
positions. Previous research experience and interests of each trainee are deciding factors for mentee/mentor
pairings. By the completion of the 2-year research training program, HU-ERA scholars will be uniquely and
competitively prepared to transition into research-focused advanced degree programs or competitive private-
sector research careers in ADRD-related disciplines. A set of well-defined professional development activities
will be implemented to facilitate the transition of HU-ERA scholars into high-level biomedical science research
careers including workshops on resume/CV building, scientific presentation skills, graduate school funding, and
interview skills. HU-ERA postbaccalaureates will also have access to HU-sponsored GRE & MCAT review
courses. All elements of the HU-ERA program will be assessed by internal and external evaluators at multiple,
specific time points with the guidance of a professional evaluator. Overall program achievements will be
determined by measures of matriculation of scholars into PhD and/or MD programs within institutions having
strong AD/ADRD research programs, or attainment of ADRD-research positions within the private sector.
Ultimate success will be demonstrated by scholars’ completion of PhD/MD programs, and subsequent work and
contributions as ADRD biomedical scientists to the understanding and development of therapeutic strategies for
ADRD."
10829356,"Project 1. Diet and Exercise Modulate the Sperm Epigenome in Men
It is well known that unhealthy diet and physical inactivity in young men and women are major contributors to
later-life development of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, leading to increased cardiovascular
disease risk. Genome wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms that can only
explain about 20% of the heritability of these metabolic diseases. Preclinical models provide clear evidence that
dietary or exercise modifications before conception result in metabolic and phenotypic changes in the offspring
through intergenerational disruption of normal epigenetic regulations of gene expression. This occurs via
alterations in i) DNA methylation, ii) histone modifications, and iii) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) both in animal
studies and in men. Our central hypotheses are that overweight and inactive lifestyle results in epimutations in
the sperm epigenome relative to the normal epigenetic programming in lean and active men and that diet and
exercise modulation leads to reversal of these epimutations resulting in both a healthier “phenotype” and
“epigenotype” which may persist after stopping the interventions. We propose three aims: Aim 1. Determines
the differences in sperm epigenome (DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs) in a cross-
sectional study in obese inactive vs. healthy active Hispanic men. We will recruit 20 healthy, active men and 80
obese and inactive Hispanic men between 18 and 40 years for this Aim. Only Hispanic men will be studied
because of the high prevalence of obesity and inactivity in Hispanic younger men and to reduce the genetic
variability influencing the epigenome. Aim 2. Characterize the plasticity of the sperm epigenome in response to
12-week diet and/or exercise training interventions in obese and inactive Hispanic men. 80 obese and inactive
men will be randomized to 4 groups of 20 men: 1) No intervention (control); 2) Low fat, low caloric diet; 3)
Supervised, periodized endurance and resistance training without modification of diet; and 4) Both exercise and
diet modification. Sperm epimutations will be compared before and after intervention within each group and
between groups. Aim 3. Identify the persistent effects of diet and exercise training at 12 and 36 weeks after
cessation of interventions on the sperm epigenome after stopping the interventions. Project aligns seamlessly
with the goals of the Center of Male Reproductive Epigenetics and with studies in mice in Project 2 and 3 that
will reveal the mechanisms by which an unhealthy lifestyle leads to formation of epimutations in spermatozoa
that are subsequently transmitted to, propagated within, and deleterious to male offspring – based on
mechanistic studies that cannot be done in men."
10829361,"Project 3 – “Germline-mediated intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of paternal
epimutations induced by a high fat diet”
Project Abstract/Summary: Abundant data from many labs has established that environmental exposures
can predispose development of disease characteristics in an exposed male and also in that male’s offspring, even
if the offspring are never, themselves, directly exposed to the original disruptive influence. In addition to
chemical exposures, deleterious lifestyle choices such as consumption of an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise,
smoking, etc., can predispose disruptions of the epigenome (epimutations) that can be subsequently propagated
to many cells or organs in the exposed male’s body, including to his sperm. Once in the exposed male’s sperm,
lifestyle-induced epimutations can then be transmitted to the male’s offspring on the basis of epigenetic
inheritance, where they can predispose development of similar disease characteristics. Though this phenomenon
has now been studied for >10 years, there remains very little information about the underlying molecular
mechanisms. We propose a novel, comprehensive, mechanism-focused set of experiments to be conducted using
a mouse model subjected to two effects mimicking deleterious lifestyle choices in humans – i) consumption of a
high-fat diet and ii) lack of a structured exercise regime. Specifically, we propose experiments designed to 1)
identify the specific combination of epigenetic parameters involved in transmission of lifestyle-induced
epimutations from sperm to the ensuing fetus, 2) reveal the extent to, and mechanisms by, which resulting
epimutations in the F1 fetus are propagated to developing somatic and germ cell lineages and on into the
immature and adult offspring, 3) determine the extent of intercellular homo- versus hetero-geneity of lifestyle-
induced epimutations in spermatogenic cells of the sire and in relevant germ and somatic cell types in his
offspring, 4) discern the mechanisms by which inherited epimutations contribute to dysregulated gene
expression in tissues relevant to aberrant/disease phenotypes in the offspring, 5) elucidate dysregulated
pathways responsible for defective or disease states among offspring of sires transmitting lifestyle-induced
epimutations, and 6) determine the extent to which the incidence of all of these deleterious effects can be
reduced by transition of males from an unhealthy to a healthy life style, including a normal diet and exercise.
A broad range of analyses of epigenomic parameters is proposed as a means to investigate mechanisms
underlying the etiology and paternal transmission of lifestyle-induced, intergenerational epimutations. Results
of the proposed research will inform future efforts to prevent, diagnose, treat or reverse the deleterious
epimutagenic effects of siring offspring while engaged in an unhealthy life style."

to achieve our goals by engaging youths, high school and college students, and younger adults from our
communities to disseminate information on reproductive epigenomics and their effects on the next generation.
We have four aims: Aim 1. Promote and sustain bidirectional knowledge sharing between the community and
academic institutions by providing opportunities for networking and developing a community specific
dissemination plan for evidence based information on how obesity and inactivity change the sperm epigenome
transmitting unhealthy phenotype and epigenotype to the next generation. Aim 2. Create educational programs,
workshops and conferences to engage younger adults, college and high school students (future parents) to
disseminate information on “healthy life styles, healthy reproductive epigenome; healthy babies”. With our
partners we will conduct community-partnered research conferences and workshops for younger adults, and
summer program for high school and college students to provide knowledge transfer on the impact of
environment on epigenetics? how improvement in the environment may reverse maladaptive epigenetic
changes? and how epigenetics are linked to intergenerational transmission of disease phenotype? Aim 3.
Develop a community focused website for the Center for Male Reproductive Genomics. Working with our
community partners, academic partners at the University of Nevada Reno and the University of Texas San
Antonio, we will develop a culturally and racially sensitive website to provide information on the role of
epigenomics in reproductive health in general and impact of sperm epigenomics on next generation’s health.

strengthens existing partnerships and builds new bridges between community and academia for education and
research."
10829366,"Project Summary
While traditional genetic studies to investigate DNA or RNA nucleotide information, epigenetic analyses aim to
characterize chemical modifications within both DNA/RNA sequences and histone proteins. Epigenetic changes
are preserved during cell division and potentially modify the expression of certain genes instead of altering the
genetic code of nucleotide sequences, which is not only due to regular and natural occurrence but also influenced
by several factors including age, the environment/lifestyle, and disease status. More importantly, some
epigenetic modifications can potentially be transmitted to offspring by transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.
Our more recent study suggests that this intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic
disorders is mediated by a nucleic acid modification enzyme called DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 2
(Dnmt2). Inspired by these findings, this P50 will focus on the relationship between epigenetic profiles and
metabolic disorders in both animal models and human subjects. To study the epigenetic regulation, it is critical
to know not only what kinds of modifications are present but also their genomic loci. Therefore, high-throughput
sequencing will be applied to profile epigenetic alterations in both animal and human samples. This Epigenomics
Core (Core D) will provide essential, cutting edge, bioinformatical expertise to facilitate the translational impact
of this highly integrated P50. Firstly, Core D will coordinate outsource library sequencing for individual projects
(Specific Aim #1). Secondly, Core D will provide centralized computational service to store, process, and
analyze the sequencing data, using our in-house well-characterized pipelines (Specific Aims #2). Finally, Core
D will be responsible for hosting an in-house web-based server to share the omics data (Specific Aim #3), which

Project 1 and our P01 team have established the essential role for KRAS* in PDAC maintenance, prompting the 
development of KRAS*-­targeted exosome-­based RNAi therapy from Project 3 that has been translated into a 
first-­in-­human trial. Collaborative work from Project 1 and Project 2 has not only elaborated the regulation of 
anabolic metabolism and nutrient salvage pathways that are essential for KRAS*-­driven tumor maintenance, but 
also identified molecular and metabolism mechanisms leading to the resistance to KRAS* depletion. While these 
studies elucidated the cancer cell-­autonomous regulation of KRAS*-­dependency in PDAC, recent studies from 
Projects 1 and 3, further demonstrated the profound impact of KRAS* on the remodeling of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), a major hallmark of PDAC and barrier for effective therapies, including 
immunotherapy. Specifically, we discovered a shift of myeloid infiltration in TME toward macrophages following 
KRAS* extinction, which produce TGFBeta to support Kras*-­independent cancer cell survival growth. In depth 
analysis of the TME further identified alternative immune checkpoints and demonstrated the importance of 
myeloid cells in immune suppression, leading to the development of novel immunotherapy regimens with 
unprecedented prolongation of survival in preclinical models. In this treatment study, we discovered a similar 
shift toward monocytic myeloid lineage which may contribute to the resistance to combinatory immune 
checkpoint inhibition. Therefore, in this next cycle, Project 1 will focus on elucidating the crosstalk between 
KRAS* and the TME, focusing on monocytic myeloid cells, with the goal of translating these mechanistic insights 
into effective new therapies. To achieve this goal, we will work closely with our innovative Cores, which have 
extensive expertise in pathology, mouse modeling and computational biology, to conduct a systematic in vivo 
genetic validation of the myeloid-­dependent KRAS* escape mechanism. These studies will be followed by 
experiments to characterize the myeloid-­mediated resistance to the alternative immune checkpoint inhibition 
regimen we have discovered. In the end, we will evaluate the anti-­tumor potential of blocking such myeloid-­
mediated resistance mechanisms in combination with novel immune checkpoint inhibitions. Our study will be 
highly integrated with Project 2 to characterize the impact of signature PDAC mutations on TME-­mediated 
KRAS* escape mechanisms. In addition, outcome from the proposed studies will be highly complementary to 
the preclinical studies of Project 3 to deplete KRAS* in cancer cells with exosome-­based RNAi therapy, in 
combination with rationally designed immune targeting strategies informed by findings from Project 1. The 
knowledge gained from these highly integrated studies aims to inform future clinical trial opportunities."
10860784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to asbestos fibers is the major risk factor for the development of malignant mesothelioma (MM). We
demonstrated that asbestos fibers induce HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, inducing
autophagy, a protective mechanism for mesothelial cells survival after asbestos exposure and contributing to
malignant transformation. Our findings that autophagy is constitutionally activated in MM cells explains MM
chemoresistance. Antidepressant drugs (ADs) were shown to block autophagy and our preliminary data
suggested that ADs, well-tolerated drugs, inhibited autophagy in MM cells. Moreover, we discovered that a
mitochondrial protein called Mcl-1 blocks chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Inhibition Mcl-1 increased the
effects of chemotherapy five-fold, suggesting that the combination of ADs with Mcl-1 inhibitor may be
particularly effective in treating MM. Here we propose to test our hypothesis that autophagy MM growth and
chemo-resistance, and that ADs, by inhibiting autophagy, increase the sensitivity of MM to chemo-induced
apoptosis, which can be further enhanced by Mcl-1 inhibition. To address this hypothesis, we will examine the
following aims:
AIM 1: To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the resistance of MM cells to chemotherapy.
AIM 2: To investigate whether ADs and the Mcl-1 inhibitor increase the efficacy of chemotherapy in MM in
mouse models.
AIM 3: To investigate, using biopsies from MM patients, the effects of ADs and the Mcl-1 inhibitor, AZD-5991,
on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, and assess survival.
Our novel and unique reagents and resources will help us understand the specific functions of HMGB1 and the
related mechanisms that induce autophagy and facilitate MM progression, which may therefore be the most
clinically relevant targets for intervention. Using ADs and the Mcl-1 inhibitor to help sensitize MM to
chemotherapy will be extremely translational. This study is of great impact to accelerate the development of
more effective therapeutic strategies to improve the prognosis of this devastating malignancy."

10900619,"EXTRACELLAR RNA COMPONENT
SUMMARY
Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) have been found in all tested human biofluids, and there is increasing evidence
that they play a role in pain mediation and modulation, and can serve as biomarkers for identification of those at
risk for transitioning to chronic pain after an acute pain episode. This project is the exRNA Component of the
Omics Data Generation Center (ODGC) for the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program. In this
Program, the Clinical Centers will recruit and collect clinical data and biofluid samples from two longitudinal
cohorts of 1800 subjects each. Biofluid samples will be collected 0, 3, and 6 months after an acute pain episode,
consisting of a specific surgical procedure or a specific musculoskeletal trauma. These samples will be used to
generate multi-omic data to validate 40 primary outcome biomarkers indicating susceptibility or resilience to
development of chronic pain, as well as to identify new candidate biomarkers. For the proposed exRNA
Component, Aim 1, which will be executed in Year 1, will involve close collaboration with other components of
the A2CPS Program to establish the final study design and protocols. All of the A2CPS Program investigators
will work together to establish the 40 primary outcome biomarkers. The ODGC and Clinical Center investigators
will jointly decide on the specific sample type(s) and collection/processing/storage methods. The ODGC and
Data integration Resource Center/Data Coordination Component (DIRC/DCC) investigators will establish
Metadata and Data Standards and a workflow for submission of metadata and data to the DCC. The exRNA
Component and the Administrative Core of the ODGC will establish a LIMS for sample and data tracking, and
recording of metadata. The exRNA Component and DIRC/Data Integration and Analysis Component (DIAC) will
establish qRT-PCR and small RNAseq data analysis pipelines. Aims 2 and 3 will span Years 2-4, with Aim 2
focused on isolation and qRT-PCR and small RNAseq profiling of exRNA from the ~11,000 biofluid samples that
will be collected by the Clinical Centers. Aim 3 will encompass submission of metadata and data to the
DIRC/DCC, quality control of the data, and data analysis and interpretation. The primary goal of this Component
is generation and submission of high-quality exRNA qRT-PCR and small RNAseq data for validation of pre-
selected candidate exRNA biomarkers and discovery of novel exRNA biomarkers. The exRNA component
investigators also anticipate participating in integrative analyses with the DIRC/DIAC aimed at developing pain
signatures comprised of multiple biomarker types (including molecular, clinical, psychosocial, and/or imaging
biomarkers) indicating susceptibility/resilience to chronic pain, which can be used to develop personalized
strategies for prevention and treatment of chronic pain. The personnel for this proposed exRNA Component
have acquired the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully execute this project from participation in the
Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium, including high-throughput workflows for extracellular vesicle-
specific and total exRNA isolation and small RNAseq library preparation and exRNA data analysis pipelines."
10859123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human hookworms infect approximately 500 million people worldwide and cause significant morbidity in women
and children residing in the tropics. The WHO has set ambitious goals to eliminate hookworm infection as a
public health problem by 2030. To meet these goals, mass drug administration (MDA) with benzimidazole
anthelmintics (albendazole, mebendazole) has been scaled up in endemic areas. Concerningly some countries
have reported reduced drug effectiveness, including Ghana. Although host factors may play a role, it remains to
be determined if genetically mediated resistance to albendazole in hookworm populations is responsible for poor
deworming drug response. The overall objective of this application is to address this knowledge gap by
developing and applying hookworm genomic resources to field-based studies in Ghana in order to elucidate the
role of hookworm (Necator americanus) genetics in albendazole treatment response. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that genomic differences in hookworm populations i) mediate parasite susceptibility to
albendazole and ii) indicate barriers to cross-community transmission in Ghana. This hypothesis will be tested
with three specific aims: 1) Create the first reference genome for N. americanus from Africa. The current
reference genome for N. americanus, generated from an isogenic strain from China, is not representative of
contemporary hookworm populations in Africa and falls short in the key quality metrics of contiguity and
completeness. A laboratory strain of N. americanus recently adapted to the hamster model from hookworms in
Ghana will be used to generate a complete, chromosome-scale reference genome. 2) Determine rates of gene
flow between populations of N. americanus across Ghana. Epidemiological factors, including infection
prevalence and cure rates, vary widely across Ghana; however, nothing is known about how hookworm
populations across the country are connected. A cross-sectional survey of hookworm infection will be conducted
in five communities spanning the width of Ghana, and whole genome sequencing will be utilized to determine
connectivity between parasite populations. 3) Investigate the association between genomic differences and
albendazole susceptibility in N. americanus from Ghana. Previous studies have identified communities in
Kintampo North, Ghana, with variant responses to albendazole. Hookworm strains representing three variable
treatment response phenotypes from these communities will be passaged in the animal model and screened for
albendazole susceptibility, followed by a genome-wide association study to identify functional regions of the
genome associated with drug susceptibility. The rationale for this project is that integrating hookworm genomics
into MDA programs will offer a novel data stream to i) assess MDA effectiveness at the community level, ii)
monitor for emerging anthelminthic resistance, and iii) improve our understanding of hookworm transmission
dynamics. This research is significant because it represents the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary, genomics-
based approach to investigate reduced deworming drug effectiveness for human hookworm infection in Africa."
10860202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Insufficient sleep is associated with inflammation and adverse health. Inflammation modulates sleep and,
conversely, insufficient sleep induces inflammation. A bi-directional relationship between disrupted sleep and
inflammation represents a positive feedback loop that negatively impacts health; however, a substantial
knowledge gap exists regarding the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation induces and/or contributes
to sleep disturbances. Glia, specifically microglia, may facilitate the bi-directional interactions between
neuroinflammation and sleep. Although microglia serve an overall beneficial role, prolonged microglial activation
drives neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Interluekin-10 (IL10), an anti-inflammatory
cytokine released by microglia, inhibits the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines; hence IL10 may be an ‘off-
switch’ for chronically activated microglia. Preliminary results from the PI’s laboratory demonstrated that
depleting microglia (<0.5%) does not change central cytokine concentrations. However, under inflammatory
conditions, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, mice with depleted microglia have elevated pro-
inflammatory cytokines, a sustained increase in NREM sleep, and significantly lower levels of IL10 compared to
control mice. These data suggest that microglia are necessary to modulate sleep triggered by inflammation.
Importantly, preliminary results indicated IL10 administration normalizes sleep after an inflammatory challenge.
We further show that IL10 administration after LPS in mice with depleted microglia, normalizes sleep and is
linked to an immediate increase in IL10 in the brain, as well as rapid microglia repopulation/activation in the
brain. This has led to the overarching hypothesis that microglia-mediated IL10 signaling is part of feedback
mechanisms that are responsible for normalizing sleep after an inflammatory challenge. This hypothesis will be
tested through the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the role of microglia and the IL10 axis in inflammation-
induced sleep disturbances; 2) Determine the influence of microglia-mediated IL10 on other central nervous
system cells after an inflammatory challenge; and 3) Investigate the extent to which IL10 replacement normalizes
sleep after an inflammatory challenge. Impact: Successful completion of these studies will elucidate novel
mechanisms that underlie inflammation-induced sleep disturbances and may open a new line of intervention to
treat inflammation-induced sleep disturbances."
10860221,"SUMMARY
 Brain imaging approaches are a promising method for unveiling network abnormalities in living brains of
patients with psychiatric disorders; however, understanding these pathologies will only be possible when human
specific abnormalities in cell connectivity, network circuit activity and transcriptomes can be directly interrogated
and correlated in an experimental system amenable to high-throughput manipulation and phenotyping. Despite
the excitement surrounding human brain organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells, scientists are frustrated
with the limited physiologically relevant anatomy and maturation of brain organoids.
 We propose to pioneer a multi-organoid-on-chip (MoC) platform, combining tissue engineering
technologies and newer organoid analysis readouts, to address this challenge. As a first proof of concept study,
we propose to recapitulate the human visual system, a commonly affected network in multiple neuropsychiatric
disorders, by co-developing three (retinal, thalamic, cortical) organoids on a microfluidic device designed to foster
functional connectivity, thereby allowing: i) co-development of distinct central nervous system (CNS) structures
with distinct anatomical organizations; ii) establishment and mapping of reproducible and functional long-range
connectivity between defined CNS structures; iii) activity-dependent maturation of synaptic connections by
spontaneous, optogenetically-regulated, and sensory-evoked stimulation of neuronal activity. The synthetic
platform will also facilitate high-throughput multimodal analysis with direct correlation between specific circuit
connectivity and molecular dynamics at single cell resolution, in healthy and diseased organoids.
 In addition to improving the understanding and screening of drugs for complex brain disorders, our
platform provides a valuable resource for the broader research community interested in modeling circuit-level
dysfunctions in other types of neurological disorders, including retinal diseases and optic neuropathy. Finally,
we expect that the method and modular technologies developed within this proposal will be foundational and
easily adapted to recapitulate connectivity between other brain regions, thereby broadening its future impact and
applications."
10860287,"Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) record and decode neural signals to enable fast,
accurate and intuitive control of assistive technologies for Veterans and others living with paralysis
arising from spinal cord injury, stroke, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using an intracortical BCI,
people with tetraplegia have been able to use their imagined hand and finger movements to command
point-and-click actions on a computer, type with a virtual keyboard, use communication apps such as
chat, and browse the web. Recently, a person with tetraplegia used the investigational BrainGate iBCI,
and specifically a decoder that could detect the attempted, individual movements of all 10 digits, to play
songs (sequences of individual notes) using an on-screen piano keyboard. Remarkably, imagined left
and right hand and digit movements could be decoded with high accuracy from neural signals recorded
from a single hemisphere of motor cortex. Building on these observations, this project aims to develop
a novel, intuitive neural typing interface for high-throughput communication by Veterans with ALS. The
research hypothesizes and evaluates several methods by which digit and hand decoding could be
combined to achieve direct neural control of a multi-row on-screen keyboard and simultaneous
trackpad actions that would dramatically increase communication rates for individuals with paralysis. To
further enhance neural decoding of imagined simultaneous bilateral hand and digit movements, this
project will leverage motor cortical signals recorded from both hemispheres. Achieving effective and
reliable neural decoding of intended, dexterous finger movements will require expanding current
understanding of the encoding principles of neuronal firing and field potentials from both hemispheres –
separately and in interaction – and creating new areal interaction models for the control of volitional
bimanual actions. This project will assess the relationship between neural encoding of discrete
digit/hand actions associated with imagined typing and encoding of point-and-click actions associated
with continuous on-screen mouse control. To facilitate rapid switching between continuous mouse
actions and rapid neural typing, we will seek latent spaces that characterize these actions in motor
cortical activity and identify approaches to maximally disambiguate these two modes for optimal real-
time decoding. This research leverages state-of-the-art machine learning innovations toward a more
capable, reliable, and versatile iBCI to promote independence for Veterans and others with severe
motor and motor impairments."
10860348,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis resulting
from Anaplasma phagocytophilum are responsible for significant morbidity and are also responsible for
mortalities in a subset of high-risk populations. Despite vertebrates and ticks having sophisticated systems of
defense, rickettsial pathogens have evolved strategies to evade host immunity and cause persistent infections.
Mutational studies to be performed with ease in all members of the rickettsiales, including for
Anaplasmataceae and Rickettsiaceae family pathogens, remain a major limiting factor. Similarly, the inability
to grow the organisms in the absence of host cell support (axenic media growth) is another major hurdle in
research progress on all important rickettsial pathogens. The ability to grow obligate intracellular bacteria
under axenic conditions can be a major advancement enabling new paths of investigation, such as
manipulating the pathogenic organisms with ease, allowing rapid clonal purification of bacterial mutants,
permitting detailed biochemical characterization and genetic studies. Our published research progress on
mutagenesis studies and axenic media development forms the basis for the current proposed research goals.
We propose to address these gaps through the following three focused specific aims: 1) optimize Himar1
mutagenesis supporting the development of a mutational library spanning a greater portion of E. chaffeensis
genome; 2) expand the targeted mutation capability in E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum valuable in
diverse research applications, and 3) optimize axenic media conditions aiding the continued replication of E.
chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum. Our prior research progress in creating mutations and similarly the
preliminary research advances on the axenic media development in Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species
highlights the importance of the planned research and substantiates our expertise that the proposed research
goals will be accomplished in a timely manner. At the conclusion of this research, we anticipate filling in major
research gaps that will aid in extending investigations on several important tick-borne rickettsial pathogens."
10838355,"The early life microbiome plays a significant role in health and disease, including immune development and
maturation, and maternal microbiota is a major determinant of infant microbiota. Infants who are exposed to
HIV but uninfected (iHEU) are more vulnerable to disease, have stunted growth, altered gut microbiota and
poorer immunity, even when they are not infected with HIV themselves. In iHEU and mice we found that higher
relative abundances of Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis in the gut around time of Bacillus
Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination results in improved cellular immunity later in life, which was accompanied
changes in gut metabolome, suggesting a link between B. infantis abundance or metabolites and T cell
immunity. We hypothesize that B. infantis supplementation in early life offers a therapeutic avenue to improve
immunity and subsequent health outcomes in iHEU. We thus propose to randomize 200 breastfed South
African iHEU into a placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of B. infantis ECV001 (a commercially available
product with proven safety and health outcomes) versus placebo. The aims are to 1) compare gut microbial
structure and function longitudinally in iHEU randomized to receive B. infantis versus placebo in early life and
evaluate associations with stool metabolome. Infant stool will be analysed using shotgun metagenomics and
metabolome using semi-targeted metabolomics. The microbiome composition and function will be compared
between groups at birth, week 4, 7 and 36 of life, and correlated with stool metabolome at week 4. 2) To
compare gut mucosal integrity and regulatory versus inflammatory T cell ratios in iHEU who received early life
B. infantis versus placebo. At baseline, weeks 4, 7 and 36 markers of microbial translocation and systemic
inflammation will be assessed by ELISA and T cell phenotyping conducted using multi-parameter flow
cytometry. We will use an unsupervised self-assembly matching approach to compare T cell subsets and
correlate findings with measurements systemic markers in infants who received B. infantis versus placebo. 3)
To compare T cell responsiveness to BCG vaccination and linear growth in iHEU who received early life B.
infantis versus placebo. BCG vaccine responses will be measured at week 7 and 36 using a whole-blood-
assay and flow cytometry, and growth at week 36 using length for age Z scores, and compared cross-
sectionally between groups. BCG vaccine responses will be correlated with B. infantis abundance at all time
points. Finally, we will develop an integrative model on the effects of B. infantis supplementation on the health
of iHEU using data generated from all aims. Determining whether B. infantis ECV001, a readily available
intervention, is effective in improving gut health, inflammation, and immunity in iHEU, a growing and vulnerable
pediatric population, could result in improved clinical management and health outcomes of iHEU. This proposal
is highly relevant for sub-Saharan Africa, where up to 30% of infants are exposed to HIV."

10850795,"WRHR ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY:
A subspecialty fellowship alone is insufficient training for most Obstetrician-Gynecologists to pursue independent
research careers. In order to successfully compete with established investigators and researchers who
completed PhD and postdoctoral training and do not have additional clinical obligations, the successful clinician-
scientists of the future require additional intensive mentored training. The Utah Women's Reproductive Health
Research Program (Utah WRHR Program) provides junior faculty members of the University of Utah
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology with mentored research experiences that provide a bridge from clinical
training to research independence, creating a cadre of independent scientific careers addressing clinically
important women's reproductive health issues. The Utah WRHR Program draws Scholars from the University
of Utah's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology as well as from nation-wide recruitment efforts. Program
mentors come from Department faculty and research communities across the campuses of the University of
Utah Health Sciences Center and our CTSA Cores and partner institutions, with particular emphasis on the Vice-
President's Clinical and Translational science (VPCAT) program. The VPCAT program has well-established,
successful academic career development programs in place that utilize the Matrix Mentoring Model (MMM). The
MMM combines self-mentorship with mentorship from senior faculty, scientific experts, peers, and staff to
produce unparalleled success in academic career development The VPCAT program (and its administrative
predecessor) has had 68% (55/84) of its graduates transition to extramural funding (over $117M to date) in
academic medical faculty positions, including six junior faculty in the Utah Ob-Gyn Department. Utah WRHR
Scholars will have full access to these successful programs. The Utah WRHR Program also draws mentors from
the main University campus. Inclusion of this latter group of mentors bespeaks the multiple dimensions of
women's reproductive health and their importance in overall health. The Utah WRHR Principal Investigator
(Robert Silver MD), Program Director (Michael Varner MD), and Recruitment Director (David Turok MD MPH)
have a combined 79 years of mentoring experience, 50 years of NIH funding, and are committed to developing
the next generation of academic Obstetrician-Gynecologists. An established Advisory Committee meets
quarterly to review Scholar's career development plans, progress, and their mentorship teams. The Utah WRHR
Program funds two Scholars at a time, with appointments for at least two years. Scholars are junior faculty in the
Department, having completed their clinical training within six years of their appointment. The Utah WRHR
Program intends to have all of its graduates pursue full-time academic careers supported by peer-reviewed
extramural funding and is committed to providing the resources needed to succeed."
10850936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) program, an early career development program for
obstetrician gynecologists, was established at the University of Washington (UW) in 1998. The aim of the UW
WRHR program is to foster the education, training and scientific development of obstetrician gynecologists
who demonstrate clear research potential and who are committed to a career in academic medicine. Our long-
term goal is to improve women's health. The program has successfully trained 11 individuals, with 2 scholars
currently in training.
This proposal describes a plan for continuation of the UW WRHR program. The goal remains a commitment to
bridge the gap between clinical and research training to enable young physicians to establish research careers
tailored to their specific interests and to become independent scientific investigators. Proposed training is a
multidisciplinary mentored experience for 2-5 years with 2 positions available per year. During this period, a
scholar devotes at least 75% of his/her time to research. The program aims to recruit individuals from other
institutions and to recruit individuals from under-represented backgrounds.
The UW WRHR is unique in encouraging cross disciplinary research and is designed to provide training
environments that create the best opportunities for scholars. We have a distinguished group of 23 mentors with
expertise in a diverse spectrum of specialties ranging from genomics to global health — with investigation in
obstetrics, gynecology, and women's reproductive health research as the core activity. Particular strengths
include: reproductive immunology, infectious disease, genetics, molecular biology, disease prevention, health
care disparities, prematurity and global health. We believe that through partnerships with outstanding scientists
in disciplines that lie outside of the traditional boundaries of obstetrics and gynecology, our scholars have the
greatest opportunity to achieve their scientific potential, build unique and successful interdisciplinary careers,
and advance the cause to improve the health and well-being of women and their families. The Obstetrics &
Gynecology Department and the School of Medicine at UW are prepared to make major commitments to
support continuation of the UW WRHR program in order to positively impact the health of women around the
globe."

The hematopoietic system has been, arguably, the best well studied tissue from a developmental and stem cell biology perspective. Historically, the study of hematopoiesis has taken advantage of flow cytometry and cell transplantation approaches as the gold standard assays to examine functional behaviors. While these studies have provided an elegant textbook view of hematopoiesis, we argue here that our knowledge of how early blood formation works is largely incomplete. This is predominantly due to the limitations of utilizing traditional assays and readouts that disrupt the normal marrow tissue archicture and neglect the anatomical localization of cells. Thus, one key biological component missing in many studies in the field is that of spatial organization. Basic questions such as when and where hematopoietic fate commitment occurs, what the exact cellular intermediates are between a stem cell and mature daughter cells, and what the identity and role of the cellular microenvironement (niche) is in the hematopoietic process remain largely unsettled. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary approach based on state-of-the-art live microscopy manipulations in combination with novel hematopoietic fate reporters to enable a comprehensive study of hematopoiesis entirely in situ. Using novel two photon-guided collection of stem cell clones directly from the bone marrow, and longitudinal live-imaging analysis of stem cell progenies, we aim to generate a spatial, temporal and molecular map of hematopoiesis at single cell resolution. Complementary proximity-based photolabelling approaches will be taken to catalogue the cellular composition of the niche in the steady-sate, diseased, and aged settings. By moving away from tissue disruptive approaches to a system that relies on observation, manipulation, and analysis of single hematopoietic cells within the bone marrow, we hope to obtain unique insights into the cellular organization of blood production."

 In the nervous system, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) sense neuromodulators to initiate
intracellular signaling cascades that control a plethora of brain functions. Of particular importance are the opioid
receptors which contribute to pain sensation, reward processing and mood regulation. Consistent with these
roles, opioid receptors serve as major drug targets for a variety of disorders. Agonists of the mu-opioid receptor
(MOR) are common analgesics and also have potential as antidepressants. However, a challenge with opioid-
based treatment is the propensity for addiction, tolerance and dangerous side effects. Unfortunately, limitations
in the precision of pharmacological approaches have hampered our ability to dissect the molecular, cellular and
circuit level mechanisms of MOR-mediated disease treatment and develop improved therapeutic strategies.
 We previously established methodologies for optical control of GPCRs using photopharmacology, which
we will adapt for the MOR in the R61 phase. In aim 1, we will develop a range of new photoswitchable compounds
for the MOR using a combination of structure-based prediction, chemical synthesis and functional analysis. In
aim 2, we will adapt these compounds to make photoswitchable orthogonal remotely-tethered ligands (PORTLs)
which covalently attach to target receptors with a labeling tag, such as SNAP, CLIP or Halo. To enable targeting
of native receptors, we will further extend our system to develop nanobody-photoswitch conjugates (NPCs) which
bind to native receptors and deliver a PORTL for reversible optical control. NPCs can either be genetically-
encoded to permit cell type-targeting or can be purified in vitro and directly applied to the sample in a gene-free
approach. Together, this will provide a new, widely-applicable toolset for MORs while also developing an
engineering framework for extension of this approach across different receptor types.
 In the R33 phase, we will harness our toolset in vivo to probe the basis of MOR-mediated antidepressant
effects in mice (aim 3). We hypothesize that activation of MORs localized on interneurons of the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) induce disinhibition that leads to normalization of dysfunctional prefrontal circuits. PORTLs and
NPCs will enable targeting to the cell types and brain regions of interest with sufficient spatiotemporal precision
to probe the relationship between receptor activation and behavioral modulation. We will use behavioral assays
of relevance to depression, as well as measures of reward and dependence with the expectation that targeted
photo-activation can produce antidepressant effects with minimal side effects. To gain further mechanistic
insight, we will perform slice electrophysiology and in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to measure the effects of
MOR activation on mPFC activity. This work will validate our toolset in vivo and provide a key step toward
understanding the mechanism of MOR modulation for depression treatment."

Alzheimer’s disease is steadily increasing in prevalence, with a devastating public health impact. The
prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease is higher in African Americans compared to white Americans, thereby
constituting a health disparity. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk for
progressing to dementia, including AD dementia. Interventions that prevent Alzheimer’s disease or change the
course of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve
recommended levels of physical activity, and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has
proven to be a safe and effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults with MCI. Therefore, our
study is focused on physical activity promotion, a potent approach to modifying multiple neurobiological
pathways implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits among elderly African Americans,
who are understudied and in whom the natural course of neurodegeneration, exercise effects on
neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical phenotypes may differ. A large body of existing
data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, and thus has the
potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other
beneficial effects. At the same time, chronic exercise has been shown to increase central levels of
neurotrophic factors, which in turn promote protection against Alzheimer’s Disease neurodegeneration
pathways via a variety of mechanisms. While physical activity interventions have been shown to have positive
effects on these factors and on resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had
a negligible representation of African Americans. Prior data suggests that African Americans enter their elderly
years against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of factors relevant to neuroprotection and
neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk, exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data
suggests that the key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease (APOE) may have differing consequences for
Alzheimer’s Disease risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences (i.e. leucocyte telomere
length) have the potential to influence the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a
randomized clinical trial to addresses these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical activity
promotion intervention or an active control group for 52 weeks. We will recruit a population with MCI. We will
assess cognitive function, brain structure and function, circulating hormones, neurotrophic factors, objectively
measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, sleep parameters, and telomere length. Our study will
take the first step toward understanding whether the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over
to elderly African Americans with MCI."

The specific objectives of the training program are to train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the
application of principles and theories of modern biotechnology to specific disease problems. The Pathobiology
program provides an interface between molecular approaches and global health. This training mission is
supported by the course requirements in our graduate program, which include core courses in Pathobiology
emphasizing principles of public and global heath, molecular/cell biology, scientific approaches to disease
related issues, and courses in epidemiology and immunology. The multiple research collaborations melding our
laboratory-based training with other Public Health Disciplines offer unique opportunities to conduct
multidisciplinary studies on diseases of global health significance. Distinguishing features our training program
include a focus on: 1) Pathogens relevant to global health; 2) Infectious contributors to chronic diseases; 3)
Diseases affecting maternal and child health; 4) Global health issues; 5) Protective and functional immune
responses; 6) Vaccine development strategies; 6) Novel methods for intervention and drug discovery; and 7)
identification of biomarkers. The Pathobiology training faculty consists of 53 mentors, who collectively have
expertise within each of these core and unique focus areas. The predoctoral training program in Pathobiology
was approved by the University of Washington Graduate School in 1990, received Interdisciplinary Program
Status in 2006, and formally moved into the Department of Global Health in 2017. This move has further
enhanced our training program through broadening our students’ learning of global health principles and
fostering interactions with international scholars. We have graduated 122 PhDs since 1990. Since 1990, our
faculty have trained over 660 postdoctoral fellows. The proposed training program will train 3 predoctoral and 3
postdoctoral trainees per year. The combination of diverse research and classroom environments provide a
strong integrated approach to enable trainees to prepare for and deal most effectively with the impact of
disease on Global Health."
10838475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondria are organelles that play a dominant role in energy metabolism and many other cellular
processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with primary heritable diseases and aging-related declines
in health, including chronic pathologies like cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. There are currently no
cures for mitochondrial diseases. However, Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptides have emerged among the most
promising therapeutics for promoting mitochondrial health. As shown by preclinical and clinical trials, and as
exemplified by the lead compound SS-31 (Elamipretide), SS peptides show exceptionally broad therapeutic
efficacy in treating mitochondrial dysfunction. Using a multidisciplinary approach, our research team has
conducted the first in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of SS peptides. Our work
supports a unique mechanism in which SS peptides interact with cardiolipin-rich mitochondrial membranes and
modulate general physical membrane properties, thereby underpinning their broad therapeutic potential. The
objective of the proposed project is twofold. The first goal is to thoroughly understand the MoA of SS peptides.
To this end, we will leverage our solid foundation of mechanistic insights to test, refine, and expand our
working models using computational, reductionist, mitochondrial, and cellular systems. The second goal is to
identify the physicochemical properties of SS peptides that are most critical to their mechanism. To this end,
we will evaluate a series of rationally designed SS peptide constructs with variations in the tetrapeptide
cationic/aromatic motif, using our established functional assays. With our highly interdisciplinary research
team, we will approach these goals as three separate aims. First, we will address how SS peptides interact
with lipid bilayers and modulate their physical properties using a combination of computational and biophysical
approaches with biomimetic model membrane systems. This will render critical information on equilibrium
peptide binding models, high resolution structural information on peptide conformational dynamics and
interaction with lipid groups, and how peptides modulate membrane electrostatics, lipid structural dynamics,
and bilayer polymorphic changes. Second, we will evaluate the effects of SS peptides on the structure and
function of membranes from yeast and mammalian models. This will establish the sites of peptide interaction in
the morphologically complex mitochondrion, how peptides affect the stability and assembly of membrane
complexes, the distribution of lipids within mitochondria, and lipid turnover kinetics. Finally, using mitochondrial
and cellular models, we will analyze the mechanisms by which SS peptides restore function under pathological
conditions including oxidative stress, high calcium load, and amyloidogenic proteins involved in type II diabetes
and Alzheimer’s disease. By this multi-tiered approach, our results will yield unprecedented insights into the
mechanism of this class of therapeutics with particular relevance to aging-related diseases. Further, our
peptide screen will inform the design of SS peptide variants with greater efficacy and/or bioavailability."

Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) have been reported as the
leading causes of mortality from an infectious disease perspective in 2020. TB disease is caused by infection
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and Kenya remains one of the countries with the highest burden of
TB incidence globally. However, the majority of individuals infected with Mtb never develop active TB, and
are classified as latent infections. Viral infections can increase the risk of reactivation of TB disease, however,
little information is known about the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-
CoV-2) on the reactivation of latent Mtb infection. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can increase risk of progression
from latent to active TB through several mechanisms. First, SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase expression
of genes that mediate systemic inflammation, which are known to be associated with heightened risk of
progression to TB disease. Second, SARS-CoV-2 infection can drive differentiation and exhaustion of T cells
that target Mtb antigens and confer protection against progression to disease. Importantly, despite the rollout
of COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, the rate of vaccination remains slow, and
emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in the region are likely to continue to compromise vaccine efficacy in these
regions. Third, co-infection with COVID-19 and active TB is of concern, hyper inflammatory responses may
induce COVID-19 infection which has the potential of accelerating TB disease. Therefore, the co-evolution
of the TB and COVID-19 pandemics will continue to be a pressing public health concern in the region. In this
study, we will recruit a cohort of latently Mtb infected individuals from 3 major health facilities in two counties
in Kenya (Nairobi and Kiambu), with and without history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We will study
the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections on reactivation of latent TB to TB disease and immunity to Mtb antigens
using a combination of biomarkers and immunological approaches. The QuantiFERON-TB-Gold in Tube
interferon-gamma release assay and a validated serological lateral flow assay specific for immunoglobulin-
G (IgG) antibodies will be used for screening latently infected TB and SARS-CoV-2 exposed participants,
respectively. We will use flow cytometry approach for identification of T cell populations impacted by co-
infection. The practical implication of this work will include identification of patho-immunological mechanisms
at play for TB latent disease reactivation in SARS-CoV-2 exposed individual’s potentially unveiling screening
and therapeutic targets. The work will also build a strong foundation in research network, infrastructure, skills
and data for follow up work on COVID-19 and TB studies in Kenya."

 Physical activity (PA) is associated with a number of short- and long-term health outcomes in children,
adolescents, and young adults (collectively, young people). In particular, an inverse dose-response relationship
exists between moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Accurately quantifying
young people’s daily MVPA is essential for effective surveillance, research, clinical, and public health
applications. Yet, technical expressions of intensity in terms of energy expenditure (i.e., oxygen consumption
or metabolic cost expressed in metabolic equivalents or METs) and/or percent of age-predicted heart rate
maximum may be uninterpretable to all but those trained in human physiology. A more practically accessible
yet still objective metric is needed to track and influence young people’s healthful levels of PA.
 The SKyRoCKeT Study (Surface-Knit and Reformulate CADENCE-Kids for Translation) will build on
the R21 CADENCE-Kids study and recruit a sex- and age-balanced sample of 360 young people 6-20 years of
age to: 1) Innovatively surface-‘knit’ the age dimension through a continuous, unbiased-by-age, and
physiologically-coherent age-cadence-log(MET) flexible surface approach without artificially-generated jumps
between age ranges and with enhanced precision of cadence-intensity threshold estimates. This single surface
will coherently transition between ages, borrow inter-age information, and be data-driven; 2) Reformulate
CADENCE-Kids by providing granular, age-specific cadence-intensity thresholds, calculated with enhanced
precision for MVPA. Data will be objectively collected using a similar treadmill protocol to the R21-funded pilot
study, with incrementally faster paces. A full running bout will now also be included for everyone when possible.
We will concurrently collect cadence with direct observation as well as with multiple contemporary wearable
technologies. Collecting cardio-respiratory fitness and habitual PA data, we will develop additional, innovative
algorithms to predict relative intensity defined by lab-based indicators of oxygen uptake (%VO2peak, %VO2R),
heart rate (%HRR, %HRmax), and rating of perceived exertion to facilitate computation of individually calibrated
thresholds applicable to the free-living or habitual PA living condition. We will also investigate additional
differences in surfaces and cadence-intensity thresholds by sex and body mass index standard deviation scores.
Height- and/or leg-length-specific (hyper)surfaces will be explored as more precise alternatives to the age
dimension; and 3) Propel science forward innovatively through translation to outdoor over-ground walking. We
hypothesize that treadmill-set cadence-intensity thresholds will reliably translate and allow eliciting predictable
metabolic costs during outdoor over-ground walking emblematic of free-living ambulatory behaviors.
 The SKyRoCKeT Study is an innovative critical step to provide coherent, interpretable, objectively monitored
step-based intensity metrics of widespread use to inform national PA guidelines, interventions, assessments,
analyses, school-based health education curricula and programs, and public health messages for young people."

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) transplantation therapies offer an appealing avenue to
combat skeletal muscle diseases. Directed differentiation of hPSCs to skeletal muscle is among
the few robust in vitro systems able to increase PAX7 expression by 1,000-fold. However, a
drawback of these hPSC-derived muscle cells is that they are functionally immature compared
to true adult muscle stem cells. Just as adult stem cells are dynamically regulated by their niche,
embryonic niches formed in development equivalently control cell fate decisions to mature from
an early precursor or progenitor and eventually to an adult quiescent stem cell. Importantly,
embryonic niches also change over developmental stages, but for hPSCs which form muscle
the niche is understudied or has never been studied. My work is significant because niches
which support muscle stem cells during the repair process, also develop in parallel with the
maturation of progenitor and stem cells from development through to adulthood. This proposal
consists of complementary in vitro and in vivo aims with the overall goal of supporting PAX7 cell
functions and numbers from hPSCs. In Aim 1, we will interrogate how muscle cells arise in the
first place and develop through key functional hallmarks of myogenesis. To accomplish this aim
we will use a lineage tracer built of a key myogenic commitment factor, SIX1, and test whether
SIX1 co-factors lead to functional maturation of hPSC myogenic cells. When hPSCs
differentiate to muscle they also produce impure cultures containing non-myogenic lineages that
we hypothesize support the muscle cells in culture. We will use genetic inhibition of master
transcription factors of these non-myogenic lineages to test their need in the support and
generation of hPSC muscle. Aim 2, seeks to understand how to support hPSC muscle cells
once they are made. We will build a simplified in vitro niche made of myotubes, extracellular
matrix taken from human tissue muscle, and PAX7 muscle progenitors, and over express key
ligands and receptors that we have already identified by spatial RNA seq to test their potential to
support PAX7 cells. We will also test the key role of hypoxia in hPSC PAX7 cell support in vitro.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we will pivot to in vivo systems using a mouse model available in the Hicks lab
that inducible ablates the mouse Pax7 cells and enables improved engraftment by hPSC PAX7
cells. We will first perform a series of in-depth time course experiments to identify the timing of
skeletal muscle stem cell niche formation following hPSC PAX7 cell transplantation. We will
then use an inducible overexpression system to test the function of a key hPSC muscle niche
factor, MEGF10, for enabling gain-of-function in at multiple stages of PAX7 niche formation.
Finally, we will test whether MEGF10 induction can improve the ability of hPSC PAX7 cells to
repopulate new myofibers and re-establish in vivo niches after injuries once transplanted.
Successful outcomes of this proposal will shed new light on how human muscle commits and
matures from hPSCs for improved cell therapies and identify key SC niche factors that can drive
muscle regeneration and support its stem cells."

Data and derived knowledge are valuable by-products of scientific investigations and are crucial in verifying and
reproducing study outcomes. Prioritizing the development of comprehensive data management infrastructure is
of utmost importance in today's scientific research environment, given that efficiently handled and readily
available data can enable the validation and replication processes. Managing sensitive information requires
rigorous data integrity and strict security. The Data Management Core aims to design a secure, scalable, and
redundant data storage and transfer infrastructure to serve as the central knowledge vault for all research
projects and cores to promote data integrity throughout the data lifecycle, including data collection, data storage,
statistical analysis and interpretation, and data transmission and dissemination. During Aim 1, we will establish
a robust data management system for intuitive and secure data storage derived from Research Projects 1-5 and
Cores C, D, and E. We will implement several levels of security to control access to the data located behind
Galveston National Lab, individual cores, and projects' vaults. The system will include data dictionaries,
standardized templates, project-specific and core-specific storage rules, and dashboards. In Aim 2, we will
implement data quality and security control mechanisms for all components of the data management system for
external data sharing and results presentation. The established system will monitor data accuracy and
completeness and ensure the system operates according to established procedures and data standards required
by the REVAMPP Network Coordination and Data Sharing Center. In Aim 3, we will provide data analysis and
bioinformatics support for robust and unbiased results. Experienced data scientists will analyze study designs,
provide independent statistical analysis of the derived data, and set up steps for automatic data QC monitoring
collection and preservation of generated metadata for each individual file. During this Aim, we will also promote
data integrity for product development following ALCOA Plus principles for assuring data quality and integrity.
The Aims will be accomplished by a highly experienced data science team working together for more than a
decade on industrial and academic projects handling highly nationally sensitive data generated by Nuclear Power
Plants as private contractors, as well as routine processing of Petabytes of clinical health records data worldwide
on behalf of UTMB. Core B will be managed by an expert in bioinformatics, data engineering, and data mining
focused on raising translational data standards by developing and promoting multi-omics projects and leading
and teaching clinical data science."
10831107,"This proposal is a renewal of an ongoing collaborative program among investigators at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) and New England Eye Center (NEEC). The program focuses on the development
of optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology and its application to investigate structural alterations and
blood flow impairment in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Aim 1. Next Generation OCT Technology
for Imaging Structure and Blood Flow in AMD. Task 1. We will develop ultrahigh speed, swept-source OCT
angiography (SS-OCTA) operating at >1MHz A-scan rates (5-10× faster than commercial OCTA). Ultrahigh A-
scan rates enable detection of subtle blood flow impairments and measurement of relative blood flow speeds
that are not possible with commercial OCTA. Task 2. We will develop ultrahigh resolution spectral-domain OCT
(SD-OCT) technology with a 2.5-3µm axial resolution, higher A-scan rates, software motion correction and
extended imaging range using dynamic depth-tracking. Ultrahigh resolution enables detection of subtle structural
alterations in the photoreceptors/retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane (PR/RPE/BM), including basal
deposits, which are potential early markers of disease. Task 3. We will develop software/hardware methods to
enable simultaneous study of structure and blood flow. Aim 2. Imaging Structural Alterations and Blood Flow
Impairment in Early and Intermediate AMD. Task 4. We will perform a cross-sectional SS-OCTA/SD-OCT
study of eyes with early or intermediate AMD to investigate markers of CC flow impairment (e.g., CC flow deficits)
and PR/RPE/BM structural alterations (e.g., basal deposit thicknesses), their mutual associations and
association with drusen to establish in vivo analogues of histopathology findings. Task 5. We will perform a
longitudinal SS-OCTA/SD-OCT study of eyes with intermediate AMD to investigate the spatiotemporal
correlation of CC flow impairment and PR/RPE/BM alterations with development of nascent geographic atrophy
(GA), non-exudative choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and late AMD (GA/exudative AMD) to elucidate
pathogenesis and identify markers of progression. Aim 3. Imaging Structural Alterations and Blood Flow
Impairment in GA. Task 6. We will perform a longitudinal SS-OCTA/SD-OCT study of GA eyes to investigate
CC blood flow impairments and PR/RPE/BM alterations and their association with GA growth. Task 7. We will
develop a model to predict the spatiotemporal progression of GA. Aim 4. Imaging Blood Flow Impairment in
Non-Exudative CNV. Task 8. We will longitudinally study eyes with non-exudative CNV, a known risk-factor for
exudation. SS-OCTA with variable interscan time analysis will be used to study relative blood flow speeds and
other flow parameters (e.g., shear stress) as possible predictors of time-to-exudation. The program develops
and applies new imaging technologies and methods that will enable the first integrated studies of blood flow
impairment and structural alterations in AMD progression. The identification of markers of disease and
progression can improve diagnosis, treatment monitoring and accelerate pharmaceutical development."

pathogenesis and control of infectious diseases, and the professional skills needed to make biomedical
advances in a group of highly selected trainees. Historically, the Program has trained a roughly equal number
of MD or MD-PhD, and PhD investigators, as we have felt it the particular strength of this Program to develop
translational investigators.
The Program has benefitted from the skills of training mentors from the Schools of Medicine and Public
Health, and the uniquely collegial and nurturing environment of UNC. Some trainees will choose to receive
formal training in methods of public health. All trainees will participate in the Responsible Conduct of
Research course. In this application we report on the training of 37 postdoctoral fellows (25 PhDs, 8 MDs, 4
MD/PhDs) in the past 15 years, including 14 women and four underrepresented minority scientist. Most

10831022,"Summary: Steroid hormones receptors (SR) are ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factors that exhibit
remarkable functional diversity in mediating cell/tissue and target gene specific responses, largely driven by
conformational dynamics of the SR protein that enables it's binding of unique subsets of transcriptional co-
regulatory proteins (CoRs) and DNA response elements. The progesterone receptor (PR) is the main target of
progestogens that are widely used clinically. PR is expressed as two protein isoforms, an N-terminal truncated
PR-A and full-length PR-B and each have distinct physiological roles dependent on the cell/tissue type. In general
PR-A is a weaker transcriptional activator than PR-B, and can act to attenuate the activity of PR-B. Both isoforms
are typically co-expressed in equal proportions in most normal tissues. However, PR-A to PR-B ratios have been
reported to be highly variable in pathological conditions. Mechanistic basis for differences in activity of the
isoforms is not well defined but is generally believed to be due to unknown differences in structural
conformations. Thus, to fully understand PRs' biology requires determination of a high-resolution structure of the
full-length PR isoforms and associated CoRs as a complex on target DNA and an understanding of how protein
interactions within the complex and structural conformations affect activity of PR. The conformational flexibility
of SRs and CoRs, coupled and their large sizes (100–300 MW), make them unsuitable to either high resolution
NMR or X-ray crystallography analysis. As an alternative, this proposal will integrate complementary solution-
phase techniques to determine high-resolution 3D structural models and uncover the conformational dynamics
within the PR:CoR/DNA complex. Recent advances in Cryo-EM enable the determination of solution-phase
structures of large conformationally heterogenous macromolecular complexes at subnanometer resolution. We
will combine Cryo-EM with crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to further refine structural Cryo-EM models
and assure high resolution and with hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) to map conformational dynamics and
allostery within the PR:CoR/DNA complex. The overall goal of this project is to determine the highest resolution
3D structure possible of full-length PR-A and PR-B in complex with classical CoRs and novel CoRs on PR DNA
response elements. Aim 1 will utilize Cryo-EM to analyze the structural features of PR-A and PR-B in complex
with the classical CoRs SRC3 and p300 and with the novel CoRs TBP and JDP2 assembled on target DNA.
Aim 2 will refine the Cryo-EM structure of PR:CoR/DNA complex using integrated structural modeling and XL-
MS to define distance constraints and probe conformational dynamics within the PR complex by differential HDX.
Aim 3 will perform functional mutagenesis studies to determine the influence of PR:SRC3/p300 interaction
surfaces revealed in structural models and from XL-MS data have on PR activity. The impact of this proposal
will be to fill a major gap in our understanding of the structure and conformational dynamics of the PR:CoR/DNA
complex. These studies could open opportunities for novel studies of drug interactions at the atomic level."

Black sexual minority men (SMM) suffer disproportionately from health inequities, including high rates of HIV,
mental health issues, and poor physical health. Intersectional stigma and discrimination contribute significantly
to these health inequities. Sleep health, an understudied factor, may play a crucial role in mediating these
health inequities. Based on emerging evidence from cross-sectional data indicating that self-reported sleep
may be compromised in Black and SMM populations, we propose to conduct a community-based participatory
study using a longitudinal mixed-methods design to investigate sleep health as a pathway linking intersectional
stigma and discrimination and health consequences in Black SMM. We will collect three waves (baseline, 6-
month, and 12-month follow-ups) of quantitative data using questionnaires/surveys, daily diary, and actigraphy
(objective sleep monitoring) from 300 Black SMM. In a subsample of 60 participants, we will conduct in-depth
qualitative interviews at baseline and 12-month follow-up. The proposed longitudinal mixed-methods study will:
1) examine quantitatively the proximal (daily) and longitudinal associations between intersectional
stigma/discrimination and poor sleep health among Black SMM and the extent to which coping with the stress
of discrimination mediates the longitudinal effect; 2) examine quantitatively the role of sleep health as a
mediating pathway between upstream determinants (intersectional stigma and discrimination) and health
consequences longitudinally, and the proximal associations of poor sleep on next day’s mood and substance
use; and 3) to explore qualitatively how individual/interpersonal-level (e.g., sleep behaviors, experiences of
discrimination, coping strategies) and structural-level (e.g., housing condition, neighborhood characteristics)
factors influence sleep health and how sleep is related to other health outcomes (e.g., mental and physical
health) over time. Qualitative interviews will also explore possible solutions to address the barriers identified.
Input from community members and stakeholders will be sought and incorporated throughout the study. The
mixed-methods results and community input will serve as a basis to inform sleep health promoting policies and
intervention strategies for this group. Drawing upon an established community-academic partnership, this
study will be the first longitudinal mixed-methods community-based participatory research to illuminate how
sleep health inequities contribute to health inequities affecting Black SMM. The proposed study aligns with the
goals of Healthy People 2030 and the NIH Sleep Research Plan, and addresses the needs of sexual minority
individuals highlighted in NOT-MD-22-012. Findings from this comprehensive investigation will pave the way
for tailored intervention efforts and help advance health equity for Black SMM."
10859931,"SUMMARY
An estimated 30-70% of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients are intolerant to first-line
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for a variety of reasons. A variety of
alternatives to CPAP exist, including the 2014 FDA approved hypoglossal nerve stimulation
(HNS) therapy. The current clinical practice to screen OSA patients for HNS surgery is to
perform a drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) procedure to assess airway collapse.
However, DISE is challenged by several limitations including potential alteration of natural
airway collapse due to the inserted endoscope, the lack of imaging surrounding soft-tissue, the
lack of simultaneously imaging the full 3D extent of the upper airway, and the purely qualitative
interpretation of airway collapse. Despite these challenges, it is mainly used because there is no
better alternative. In this proposal, we propose to address this gap by systematically developing
a novel 3D dynamic MRI (3D-DMRI) scheme capable of quantitating airway collapse during
sleep. We propose a novel scheme that synergistically combine (a) parallel imaging via
dedicated airway coils, (b) motion robust 3D stack of spiral encoding, (c) learning based spatio-
temporal regularization, and (e) quantitative analysis to extract imaging phenotypes to
characterize 3D airway collapse. In Aim 1, we will develop the scheme and systematically
validate it on a cohort of OSA patients being screened for HNS therapy. In Aim 2, we will
develop a deep transfer learning based segmentation scheme to extract 3D-DMRI based
phenotypes that characterize spatio-temporal patterns of airway collapse. In Aim 3, we will
assess the clinical utility of our scheme to characterize the pattern of airway shaping and
collapse both in the awake and sleep state, and will evaluate it against existing DISE clinical
protocol. In aim 4, we will determine if the 3D-DMRI derived imaging-based biomarkers are
predictive of clinical outcomes of HNS therapy. This study will leverage the principal
investigator’s expertise in rapid upper-airway MRI, along with collaborators’ interdisciplinary
expertise in otorhinolaryngology, clinical sleep medicine, image analysis. Successful completion
of this study will showcase the feasibility of MRI-based “virtual endoscopy” and immediately lead
to several clinical trials for OSA. Specifically, we anticipate having demonstrated 3D-DMRI to be
an effective alternative to DISE for determining the eligibility of patients with OSA for HNS, and
show preliminary evidence if these biomarkers are predictive for HNS treatment success."

Within a patient’s tumor, malignant cells are surround by a complex and dynamic collection of cell types, which
includes the intratumoral microbiota. However, there is a fundamental lack of understanding on how microbes
within the tumor microenvironment (TME) interact with human components of the tumor, or how they might
contribute to disease progression; presenting a significant barrier to progress. Comparative microbiome analysis
has revealed an enrichment of distinct invasive bacterial communities in tumor tissue compared to adjacent
normal tissue. Large-scale epidemiological studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between high
intratumoral load of specific oncomicrobes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer (CRC), with
disease relapse and poorer survival. Yet, while pan-cancer tumor-tissue microbiome studies have exposed the
pervasive presence of intratumoral bacterial communities within most cancer types, most of these studies to date
have centered on bulk tissue molecular analysis, which obscures the spatial distribution and localized impact of
the microbiota within tumors. My team recently discovered that viable intratumoral bacteria have a heterogenous
distribution within human oral and CRC tumors, where they form bacterial-colonized microniches (BCMs).
These BCMs are metabolically active, dominated by the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, and
characterized by myeloid cell infiltration, upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins PD1, CTLA4 and Lag3,
and reduced T-cell infiltration. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and associated phenotypic diversification of
cellular subpopulations within the TME remain major factors for cancer progression and therapy resistance. In
order to understand how the TME contributes to cancer progression and treatment resistance it is imperative
that we assess interactions of all components of the tumor ecosystem, both mammalian and prokaryotic. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that BCMs within tumors are contributing to ITH by modulating cancer cell
functions, as well as the influx and spatial distribution of immune cell types in colonized tumor regions. In Aim 1,
to understand the focal tumor distribution of BCMs, their stroma-immune-tumor cell spatial interactions, we
propose to functionally map cellular and metabolic features of BCMs within patient tumor tissues in-situ. In Aim
2 we will delineate the human cell types within patient tumors that harbor intracellular bacteria, the identity of
those intracellular bacteria, and their impact on host transcriptional programs at the single cell level. In Aim 3,
using animal model systems, we seek to examine the role of the oncomicrobe Fusobacterium nucleatum in
remodeling cellular components of the TME. My team has the breadth of experience to accomplish this project
as it seeks to apply multi-omic approaches to delineate microbial and host interactions within the TME. Our goal
is to advance mechanistic understanding of host-microbiota interactions within the TME with the potential to
reveal novel approaches for cancer prevent and treatment."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in long-term functional impairments due to loss of cord tissue and limited
regeneration. Human neural stem cell (hNSC) transplantation has exciting potential as a treatment for
SCI, but the complex interactions between hNSC and the extrinsic microenvironment are poorly
understood. The objective of this proposal is to address this gap in knowledge, enabling both optimization
of therapeutic donor hNSC transplantation, as well as new insights into in vivo signaling/transcriptional
networks, and the consequence of these networks for hNSC localization and fate after SCI. Critical to this
is goal is elucidating mechanisms of immune-NSC signaling.
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) causes disruption of the blood-spinal-cord barrier, and a robust influx of serum
proteins, including C1q. SCI also results in a multiphasic and prolonged immune response, in which
infiltrating and resident immune cells also secrete C1q. We have shown that C1q influx is chemoattractive
for transplanted hNSC, inducing hNSC migration towards and clustering at the injury epicenter, and driving
hNSC towards an astroglial lineage. Blockade of C1q in vivo releases both migration and lineage selection,
and enhances SCI repair and locomotor recovery. We have also shown that C1q directly modulates hNSC
migration, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro via a receptor-mediated signaling mechanism. Using an
unbiased screen, we identified novel interactions between C1q and five candidate receptors expressed by
hNSC. Among these is CD44, a receptor with an established role in regulating cellular behavior. Our
published data identify CD44 as a principal mediator of hNSC chemoattraction to C1q in vitro and in vivo,
and show that C1q-CD44 signaling also modulates hNSC fate. Further, CD44 deletion in hNSC in an acute
transplantation paradigm in vivo enhances SCI repair and locomotor recovery.
The central hypotheses of the proposed aims are that C1q-CD44 signaling in NSC alters the NSC
transcriptome via CD44-ICD heterochromatin modulation, and that deletion of CD44 in transplanted hNSC
after SCI will enhance repair. Aim 1 investigates the effect of CD44 KO on hNSC gene expression at
baseline and in response to the CD44 ligands C1q, HA, and osteopontin. Aim 2 tests the effect of CD44
deletion on the repair capacity of hNSC transplanted into the SCI microenvironment, and the dependence
of this effect on C1q. Aim 3 investigates the effect of CD44 KO in hNSC on localization and fate in relation
to signaling and transcriptional networks in vivo after SCI"

 Our level of arousal influences almost all of the cognitive and behavioral abilities that allow us to engage
with our environment. A variety of terminology has been used to describe arousal-related changes in cognition,
including wakefulness, internal state, engagement, and alertness. Despite this ambiguity, it is clear that arousal
is a global phenomenon that affects brain activity, systemic physiology, and behavior. Arousal deficits in behavior
and systemic markers, such as heart rate and pupil diameter, are present in many neurologic disorders, including
Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, and attention deficit disorder. In order to use these non-invasive systemic measures
of arousal as diagnostic markers, we need to understand how arousal level influences brain activity in
neurotypical cognition and in turn leads to changes in behavior. The goal of this proposal is to investigate
changes in brain activity that occur with fluctuations in arousal level. Specifically, we will study slow changes in
simultaneously measured cortical neural population activity and cerebral hemodynamics. We will track arousal
level using pupil diameter and heart rate. Our overarching hypothesis is that we can link minute-to-minute arousal
fluctuations with slow changes in neural population activity and cerebral hemodynamics. In the first aim, we will
study internally driven variations in arousal level that occur over hours and across the circadian cycle. In the
second aim, we will probe arousal level using an external stimulus to assess whether we can modulate arousal-
linked drifts in neural population activity and hemodynamics. Our strategy to record simultaneous population
activity and hemodynamic changes in context of systemic parameters and behavior will allow us to
comprehensively probe arousal-related changes and integrate arousal effects across the brain, body, and
behavior. Results from this proposal will help to understand how deviations in arousal, measured via behavior
and systemic physiology, could serve as biomarkers of changes in global brain activity that are present in
neurologic disorders.
 This proposal will be completed in the interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment of Carnegie
Mellon University and its Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition that consists of a large community of
neuroscientists and engineers investigating brain activity underlying cognition and brain disorders. Under the
guidance of Dr. Matt Smith, an expert in systems neuroscience, and Dr. Jana Kainerstorfer, an expert in
biomedical optics, this proposal will provide me with a multimodal skill set in electrophysiology, optics, and
psychophysics to probe cognitive function. These skills will help me progress towards my goal of becoming a
physician scientist studying the interaction between the brain, systemic physiology, and behavior to identify
biomarkers of cognitive disorders."
10830693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pharmacologically targeting intracellular proteins is a key challenge of modern drug development, requiring
innovation and the development of new technologies. This challenge is made more difficult by the fact that many
protein targets remain beyond the reach of established drug discovery technologies because they lack easy-to-
find and unique binding pockets, possess large, and flat contact areas. Indeed, ~85-90% of the human genome
is considered “undruggable,” encoding proteins that are deemed too challenging to bind with conventional
molecules. Hence, new approaches are needed for drugging intracellular protein targets. To address this unmet
need, this project seeks to develop a new class of computationally-designed mRNA therapeutics that encode
peptide-guided protein degraders, known as ubiquibodies (uAbs), for potent and selective degradation of
historically undruggable targets not addressable by conventional drugs. Specifically, uAbs are modular,
programmable proteins consisting of a genetically engineered fusion between an E3 ubiquitin ligase, linker, and
protein/peptide guide. Following ectopic expression in cells, these heterobifunctional chimeras direct the activity
of an E3 to a protein of interest (POI), leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI by
the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). The objective of this Phase I STTR is to design
customized uAbs against β-catenin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), two
intracellular transcription factors that hold promise as drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and other liver diseases. The hypothesis of this project is that uAbs can be
designed to selectively remove cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP, with the potential to inhibit the tumorigenic
and proteotoxic potential, respectively, of these drug targets while also limiting toxicity. The plan to address these
hypotheses includes first leveraging an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-powered platform to
create designer uAbs that selectively degrade cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP (Aim 1) and then to develop
and evaluate a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based strategy for systemically delivering synthetic uAb-encoding
mRNAs in cultured cells and mice. The best performing mRNA-LNP formulations will then be evaluated in mice
to assess biodistribution, efficiency and duration of target degradation, and biological impacts. Overall, the
proposed studies will demonstrate a new paradigm for drugging the proteome based on computational design
of peptide-guided uAbs, with proof-of-concept studies in this Phase I proposal focused on accelerating the
removal of two key intracellular disease drivers through LNP-mediated delivery of mRNA encoding customized
uAbs. Successful completion of this project will lead to a future Phase II application that will explore the
therapeutic potential of uAbs following systemic delivery of optimized mRNA-LNP formulations in relevant animal
models of HCC and AATD. These studies will serve to advance the development and commercialization of
UbiquiTx’s proprietary therapeutic candidates towards an IND."

POP BIO’s goal is to commercialize interstitial chemo-phototherapy (I-CPT) as a new therapeutic option for
locally advanced liver cancers. Doxorubicin (Dox) can be actively loaded into long circulating, serum-stable,
porphyrin- phospholipid (PoP) liposomes and be released with 665-nm laser light (PhotoDox). This approach
leads to vastly enhanced drug accumulation in irradiated tissues, resulting in ultrapotent tumor ablation. In the
phase I STTR, we employed this dosimetry-treatment planning platform to guide light administration of I-CPT
with PhotoDox. We demonstrated that this treatment planning with light dosimetry is effective in ablating large
orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tumors in rats. The phase II STTR focuses on optimizing treatment planning
with light dosimetry using larger (~50cm3) tumors in woodchucks as well as developing a GLP toxicology package
as part of an FDA IND submission based on our pre-IND meeting. POP BIO has previously generated non-GLP
toxicity data of PhotoDox in rats including cursory establishment of the maximum tolerated dose. In 2019, POP
BIO held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, who confirmed the suitability of the 505(b)(2) route for components of
PhotoDox and provided guidance about the required toxicological studies required prior to first-in-human studies.
The toxicology program will also generate sera samples in two animal models that need to be analyzed by LC/MS
(the request of this application). In this Commercial Readiness Program application we propose to further
advance I-CPT with PhotoDox towards an IND for enabling future clinical studies by assessing the
pharmacokinetics of Dox, doxorubicinol (Dox-ol), the major metabolite of Dox, and PPa-lipid, the photoactive
excipient of PhotoDox, as well as the stability of PhotoDox under accelerated storage conditions. These tasks
are required by the FDA as part of our IND package. The sera samples to assess pharmacokinetics have been
generated as part of the parent Phase II STTR award’s GLP toxicology program. Under GLP conditions using
LC/MS, the sera concentration of free Dox, liposome entrapped Dox, Dox-ol, and PPa-lipid will be measured.
Subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis, as part of this application, will be performed by Roswell Park’s
Bioanalytics, Metabolomics & Pharmacokinetics (BMPK) Shared Resource. The result of this application will be
the generation of data directly used in POP BIO’s IND package generation. If successful, I-CPT with PhotoDox
stands to benefit the majority of new liver cancer patients, who have inoperable and problematic primary tumors."
10830614,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 One of the most common hemoglobin (Hb) variants is homozygous sickle hemoglobin (HbSS) which leads
to sickle cell disease (SCD). Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD. Approximately
100,000 individuals are living with SCD in the United States. It is estimated that 50-90% of the babies born with
SCD in Africa die by their 5th birthday, and >70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of
SCD requires early diagnosis, which is critical in improving the quality of life. The clinical gold standard for Hb
variant detection is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or point-of-care diagnostic testing,
including the Gazelle Hb variant test invented at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and
commercialized by Hemex Health, Inc. Over 400,000 Hb variant tests have been distributed by Hemex in more
than 27 countries. Most current and emerging SCD therapies address symptoms by improving Hb oxygen (Hb-
O2) affinity. Current laboratory and POC tests do not support treatment monitoring in SCD, especially for Hb-O2
affinity modifying therapies. The Gazelle Hb variant test has proven to be game-changing in low-resource
settings for Hb variant diagnosis, but Gazelle currently doesn’t support monitoring of therapies that improve
Hb-O2 affinity. A diagnostic system for Hb variant screening and Hb-O2 affinity treatment monitoring is needed.
 Currently, there is no FDA-approved POC diagnostic device to detect Hb variants and quantify Hb-O2
affinity in hemoglobin disorders. Gazelle Rapid Hemoglobin-Oxygen Dissociation Assay (RHODA) will be
the first POC diagnostic platform for screening and treatment monitoring for SCD, integrating Hb variant
diagnosis and Hb-O2 affinity functional analysis in the same platform.
 The proposed technology, Gazelle RHODA, is significant, innovative, and uniquely incorporates an optical
spectroscopic component that enables rapid screening for Hb variants such as sickle hemoglobin (HbS). In the
same test, the optical absorption spectra analysis and an integrated fluorescence measurement enable the
determination of Hb-O2 affinity by measuring Hb-O2 saturation level (SO2, %) and oxygen partial pressure
(pO2, mmHg), respectively determining p50. p50 is the partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of Hb is
saturated with oxygen. p50 is an important but underutilized clinical parameter due to technical and operational
limitations. Rapid measurement of p50 is important for detecting genetic or disease-induced changes in blood
oxygen affinity. p50 is used to determine the quality of blood/red blood cell products for chronically and
critically ill patients, as well as pediatric, neonatal, post-partum, and in-utero transfusions. SO2 and pO2
measured by Gazelle RHODA are key functional and physiologic tests that help determine the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood. This STTR Phase I project aims to: (1) Integrate RHODA into the Hemex Health Inc.
Gazelle diagnostic platform for rapid, point-of-care screening of hemoglobin variants and hemoglobin-oxygen
affinity; (2) Test and validate the integrated Gazelle RHODA platform in a pilot clinical study."

Pneumococcal carriage is the precursor for development of pneumococcal disease, and is also
responsible for transmission of the organism from person-to-person. Children with Sickle Cell
Disease (SCD) are particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due
to the i n a b i l i t y of their defective immune system to effectively handle encapsulated
bacteria. This has led to the recommendation of anti-pneumococcal prophylaxis for SCD
children including the administration of penicillin and the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine
(PPV23) in the past. Though these prophylactic measures decreased the rate of IPD among
SCD children, breakthrough disease still occurred, mostly in children aged <3 years. In the last
decade, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCVs) have become available in about 80% of the
countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Epidemiological evidence from various studies indicate that
PCVs can cause a shift in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes usually towards non-
vaccines types in both carriage and disease. In areas of high SCD prevalence in sub-Saharan
Africa, pneumococcal surveillance data following introduction of PCVs remain scarce. The goal
of this proposed study is to understand the epidemiology of pneumococcal carriage and
invasive disease among children with SCD in the post-conjugate vaccine era in Ghana. To
address this goal, we will execute three specific aims as follows: (i) to determine the frequency
of pneumococci acquisition in SCD children vaccinated with PCV13 and evaluate the common
serotypes carried and their persistence. (ii) to determine the incidence of IPD and the causative
serotypes among children with SCD. (iii) to evaluate the antibiogram of pneumococci isolated
from children with SCD and describe the penicillin and / or multidrug resistant clones.
Information from the study would be useful in the prevention and management of pneumococcal
infections among children with SCD in Ghana."
10841016,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals in the
U.S. It has so far resisted attempts to develop effective therapies despite numerous (failed) clinical trials based
on known targets, most identified over 20 years ago. While genomic research (e.g. the Alzheimer’s Disease
Sequencing Project; ADSP) has identified numerous additional risk loci, these results derive primarily from case-
control datasets. In contrast, cohorts designed to identify variants that may protect from AD, and those using
complementary study designs, are few. We used our extensive experience with the Amish communities in
Indiana and Ohio to establish a cohort of older individuals at high risk of developing AD but who are cognitively
unimpaired (CU). The Amish provide a unique opportunity to identify protective variants for AD because of their
reduced background genetic variation and environmental risk factors. Their small founding population and
endogamy provides enrichment for rare variants. Founder populations also enable testing for non-additive allelic
effects and can magnify sub-significant association signals identified in case-control studies. The stability and
engagement of our Amish participants enables longitudinal assessments of cognition and biomarkers. Our
primary goals are to identify AD protective loci and characterize pre-clinical biomarkers of progression to
cognitive impairment. Building on our existing large cohort, our replicated protective locus and several suggestive
protective loci, and our existing biobank of DNA and plasma and databank of GWAS and WGS, we propose to:
1) Perform longitudinal assessment of cognition in our family-based Amish cohort; 2) Identify protective factors
for AD and predictors of progression to cognitive impairment by analyzing genomic and longitudinal cognitive,
biomarker, and SDOH data; and 3) Examine the functional implications of current and novel genes and variants
by prioritizing loci using in silico annotation for functional consequences followed by in vitro functional
characterization. Our results will identify potential druggable targets and accelerate the development of better
treatments for AD."

The overall goal of our work is to understand how microtubules and microtubule motors define
the structure of cytoplasm and interphase cell polarization. We and others have established, that
in addition to the “canonical” function of moving cargo along microtubules, kinesin-1 and
cytoplasmic dynein can move cytoskeletal filaments themselves thus organizing the cytoplasm
and polarizing cells. We will use three biological models in this proposal (i) Drosophila oocytes,
where transport of microtubules by kinesin-1 drives bulk rotation of cytoplasm for localization of
polarity determinants and cytoplasmic dynein responsible for the bulk cargo transport in nurse
cells and from nurse cells to the oocyte; (ii) cells with elongated processes (neurons and terminal
cells of the trachea of Drosophila) where the movement of parallel or antiparallel microtubule
arrays is involved in the generation of processes and extension of the intracellular lumen in
terminal cells; (iii) dynamics of intermediate filaments in mammalian cells that is defined by
microtubules and microtubule motors. Discoveries of new mechanisms that we hope to generate
will be useful for development of new treatments of neurodegenerative disorders and the defects
of egg development in humans."

Our research program is focused on the development of new broadly applicable tools for peptide mimicry.
Peptides are an important class of compounds that modulate a variety of biological responses, including
as hormones, neurotransmitters, and antimicrobials. Occupying the space in between conventional small
molecules and biologics, they can also be designed to inhibit large protein-protein interaction surfaces.
However, strategies are needed to convert them into more stable molecules while retaining the bioactivity
of the native peptides, ideally employing scaffolds that can adopt precise secondary structures while
being amenable to rapid derivatization for library synthesis and screening. Towards that goal, we develop
new methods for late-stage peptide functionalizations, and devise new strategies for the synthesis and
conformational control of acyclic, highly functionalized peptidomimetics. This includes (1) the study of
azapeptide folding and the development of new strategies for their chemoselective functionalization and
rigidification, and (2) the discovery and application of new conformationally-constrained N-substituted
glycine peptoid monomers. These novel methods are then applied to the synthesis of bioactive peptide
analogs."

Many regions of the brain including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and limbic structures are
highly enriched with synaptic zinc. Synaptic zinc (as Zn2+) is loaded into presynaptic vesicles by zinc
transporter 3 (ZnT3), where it is coreleased with glutamate during synaptic transmission. Since synaptic
zinc inhibits AMPA and NMDA receptors – which mediate the majority of excitatory glutamatergic
transmission in the brain – synaptic zinc can modulate excitatory synaptic signaling. ZnT3 KO mice (which
lack synaptic zinc) display a range of cognitive and sensory impairments and demonstrate behavioral
deficits associated with autism and schizophrenia. Mounting evidence from human populations shows
that mutations in certain zinc transporters are linked with major neurological disorders such as
schizophrenia. Together, these findings strongly suggest that synaptic zinc signaling is important for
neuronal processing. The goals of this project are to understand how synaptic zinc contributes to normal
neuronal function and how disruptions in zinc signaling are linked to pathological neuronal conditions.
We will take three complimentary experimental approaches to these questions. 1) Using ex vivo brain
slice preparations and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, we dissect the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping
the dynamics of synaptic transmission at specific synaptic connections in cortical microcircuits. 2) Using
in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, we assess the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping the sensory-evoked
responses of specific classes of auditory cortical neurons in awake mice. 3) Using in vitro high-throughput
screening assays and rational compound design approaches, we are designing novel tools to modulate
the function of specific zinc transport proteins. Together these approaches will allow us to answer
fundamental questions concerning the role of synaptic zinc in brain function and provide new mechanistic
insights into endogenous mechanisms that shape synaptic and neural processing."

Vestibular receptors encode information about head movements and send these signals through
the vestibular nerve to the brain stem. In turn, receptors and afferents receive bilateral inputs from
cholinergic efferent fibers that originate in the brain stem. To date, the function of the efferent
pathway has remained elusive. It has been suggested that efferents might play a role in normal
development of vestibular reflexes and compensation after lesions. In particular, efferents mainly
affect activity of afferents with calyx terminals that completely cover the basolateral walls of
vestibular hair cells, providing a unique form of synapse. Furthermore, in addition to acetylcholine,
sources for gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) have also been found in the vestibular periphery,
in the supporting cells and probably also in some of the efferent fibers. However, there is little
known about the synaptic properties, receptor types, and interaction between cholinergic and
GABAergic inputs and their effect on responses of vestibular afferents. The goal of the present
proposal is to investigate the underlying mechanisms that mediate changes in afferent response
properties by cholinergic and GABAergic inputs. We will use an in vitro whole preparation of the
vestibular sensory epithelium to study the effect of specific agonists of different subtypes of
receptors on hair cells and afferent terminals in mouse. We will also use an in vivo mouse
preparation to record response properties of vestibular nerve afferents along with optical
stimulation of cholinergic fibers/ GABAergic cells and application of agonists and antagonists of
specific receptors in the inner ear. Finally, we investigate the effect of these drugs on vestibular
function in alert mice by measuring the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Results of these studies provide
the information to correlate changes at the level of single synapses in the end organs, to vestibular
nerve activity, and behavioral responses. The ultimate goal of these studies is to pave the way
for finding new treatment options through local application of drugs into the ear to improve
vestibular compensation in patients."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the byproduct of normal metabolism as well as the differential state and
environment of the cell. They lead to oxidative stress and can be the causes of multiple pathologies, including
cancer. Moreover, oxidative stress and the cell's ability to deal with it can play a major role in the treatment of
these diseases. However, current methods to quantify oxidative stress in vivo are severely lacking and to date
there is no routine method to non-invasively image redox or oxidative stress in humans.
A new platform, hyperpolarized MRI, has the potential to change the way we interrogate metabolism in vivo. We
and others have utilized the power of this approach, combined with endogenous substrates, to non-invasively
image a metabolic substrate and its subsequent downstream products using conventional MRI. In our preliminary
work, we have developed a novel approach to imaging oxidative stress using HP dehydroascorbate (HP DHA),
the oxidized form of vitamin C. Using HP DHA, we are able to image the in vivo generation of HP vitamin C and
utilize the cells' endogenous system to create a non-invasive redox measurement. Combining this with fast
spectroscopic imaging approaches provides a means of readily imaging redox in mice.
These exciting developments provide the basis for pursuing the objectives of this innovative proposal to utilize HP
DHA MRI to further quantify oxidative stress in vivo. Using HP DHA, we will develop a parameter for conversion to
Vitamin C in vivo that quantifies the amount of oxidative stress the cell is under using both acute generation of
ROS in the normal brain and models of murine brain tumors treated with radiation. In parallel, we will utilize what
we have recently learned about the physical chemistry of hyperpolarized probes to design a more robust and
better performing HP DHA. Finally, we will conduct the optimization and toxicology studies necessary to translate
HP DHA to humans, aiming to conduct the first-in-human studies of this approach.
It is the overarching goal of this proposal to use this novel approach in metabolic imaging and lay the foundation
for future metabolic imaging of oxidative stress in patients. This effort will also provide a means of non-invasively
monitoring treatment response that aims to increase oxidative stress, which could be readily integrated into
standard MRI."

The main goal of the lab is to provide detailed structural and functional insight into serotonin signaling and
transport, and elucidate how drugs and medications modulate receptor and transporter function. Serotonin (5-
hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) regulates much of human physiology in- and outside the CNS, including cognition,
mood, endocrine function and cardiovascular development. However, despite 5-HT's physiological and medical
importance, atomic-level insight into the mechanisms of 5-HT signaling and transport, and how drugs interact
with these molecular targets has remained incomplete. This lack of understanding has led to drug safety issues
in the past, and greatly hindered the exploration of many 5-HT targets for novel therapeutic applications. Our
lab thus focuses on three major directions to address these gaps. Firstly, we aim to investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which 5-HT receptors signal through different transducers using structural and biochemical
approaches. For instance, we will delineate the molecular determinants of how the 5-HT1A receptor signals via
different G proteins of the Gi/o/z family, and elucidate how different drugs affect the receptor's conformational
landscape to engage distinct signal transducers. A second major direction is to structurally and functionally
characterize off-target activities of serotonergic drugs at understudied serotonin-related transporters such as
the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) or organic cation transporters (OCTs). Through these studies,
we aim to provide a molecular level context of side effects reported for commonly prescribed drugs, but also to
uncover the fundamental mechanistic properties of these understudied transporters. This work will further
elucidate modulatory drug binding sites at these transporters and allow contrasting them with those found at 5-
HT receptors. Lastly, we also aim to harness our structural and functional insights to develop target-selective
and pathway-specific probes for both 5-HT receptors and transporters. The goal here is to generate chemically
and pharmacologically novel and useful tools that enable inquiries into serotonin-related (patho)biology in vitro
and in vivo. Our studies are both innovative technically and conceptually, as the unique combination of
structural, pharmacological, and drug discovery approaches as well as the focus on both receptors and
transporters will provide a holistic framework of serotonin-related biology and pharmacology at the molecular
scale."

Our goal is to integrate structure and sequence-based approaches grounded in statistical mechanics to
understand key features of molecular recognition by proteins, as well as protein fitness and function more
generally. There are three aims. The first is focused on mapping complex conformational and fitness landscapes
of proteins. We will integrate machine learning (ML) sequence co-variation and molecular dynamics structure-
based approaches to analyze the sequence dependent conformational landscapes of proteins with a particular
focus on the landscapes that govern the transitions of kinase family proteins from the active to functionally
important inactive states. With our collaborators we will investigate the sequence dependent origin of the
alternative binding modes for peptide substrates that TKs have compared with STKs. This work has important
implications for the design of therapeutics targeting Src and other cytoplasmic TKs which appear to bind peptide
substrates in an unusual way. Also, as part of our first aim, we will map the free energy landscape of the set of
kinase P-loop active conformational states; this information is needed for efforts to develop anti-cancer
therapeutics with higher specificity. The thrust of the second aim is to realize the power of the sequence-
covariation ML methods we are developing to detect and decompose multi-residue allosteric interaction motifs
within kinases and kinase protein complexes by evaluating connected mutational correlations that carry
signatures of indivisible units of biological information flow. These methods are designed to identify allosteric
pathways and will be generalizable to other protein targets we are working on including GPCRs and the HIV
Intasome. Our third aim is to build on the structure-based molecular dynamics approaches we recently
developed to determine the excess chemical potential of water molecules at the surface of proteins. The excess
chemical potential provides quantitative information about position specific thermodynamic features of interfacial
water molecules and their networks. Together with our experimental Cryo-EM collaborators we will use this
information to refine solvent at the protein-solvent interface in Cryo-EM density distributions in an iterative and
self-consistent way; this will substantially improve upon current methods for locating and refining solvent in Cryo-
EM maps of proteins and their assemblies. This new refinement tool will be made available to the structural
biology community. We will build on our recent development of classical density functional methods to evaluate
how the displacement of specific solvent molecules located in protein binding sites affects the affinities and
specificities of the small molecule ligands targeting these sites."

Chromosome breakage can generate extraordinary genetic novelty that is selected upon during
tumor progression. One commonly observed feature of cancer is the breakage-fusion-bridge
(BFB) cycle, where double-strand breaks set off a chain reaction that leads to copy number
variations and complex chromosome shattering events. The BFB cycle was first described in
maize by Barbara McClintock in the 1940s, and led to the discovery of transposable elements
(TEs). Two types of TEs, Activator/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) and Suppressor-mutator (En/Spm),
burst from her BFB samples, leading her to hypothesize that chromosome breakage can lead to
a genome-wide response she called “genome shock”. Her observation that BFB activates
previously dormant transposable elements suggests that major epigenetic changes accompany
BFB, likely compromising DNA methylation and heterochromatin. DNA demethylation and TE
activation are also observed in many cancers, but causal relationships between BFB and
demethylation have not been clearly established. Unlike in animals, maize tolerates the
transmission of major chromosomal abnormalities through gametogenesis, greatly facilitating
downstream studies. We have developed a system for inducing the BFB cycle in maize and
demonstrated its ability to induce genetic instability and large chromosomal abnormalities. In our
approach, an array of LexO repeats inserted on a chromosome arm is combined with a LexA-
CENH3 transgene and initiates a second centromere. With long read sequencing and ChIP-seq
assays, we will analyze the genomic and epigenomic changes that follow BFB over multiple
generations. We will also deploy high-sensitivity screens for TE activation. These approaches
will allow us to test at the molecular level the extent to which genome reordering by BFB leads
to genetic and epigenetic changes in otherwise wild type genetic backgrounds. The proposed
research will establish a new model for investigating BFB in complex eukaryotes and provide
greater insight into how the BFB cycle impacts epigenetic processes that have the potential to
further destabilize the genome. In addition, the work will provide a direct test of the genome
shock hypothesis, which has provided an important guidepost for interpreting the chromosome
rearrangements in cancer as well as hundreds of other genome restructuring events in animals,
plants, and fungi."
10842672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The plasticity of cell identity is evident through nuclear transfer and transcription factor (TF)-mediated
reprogramming. Despite this, current reprogramming methods often yield developmentally immature and
heterogeneous cell populations and therefore are unsuitable for therapeutic application or disease modeling. We
seek to address the fundamental questions of why direct reprogramming is inefficient, representing a critical
gap in knowledge that will be widely applicable across many cell fate engineering strategies and has
broader significance for understanding how cell identity is regulated. Over the past five years of NIGMS-
supported research, we have developed and applied innovative single-cell multiomic lineage tracing and novel
computational technologies to dissect the mechanisms of pioneer TF-mediated reprogramming. Our proposed
research builds on this work, focusing on two primary objectives:
1. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that successful reprogramming events arise from rare
 'reprogramming permissive' cell types or states in which normally inaccessible target genes are engaged by
 ectopic TFs to drive fate change. However, the lack of understanding about the origins of reprogramming
 presents a significant challenge in characterizing reprogramming permissive states. We will develop and
 apply multiomic lineage tracing to identify the origins of successfully reprogrammed cells across various cell
 fate conversion strategies. Elucidating reprogramming initiation mechanisms will identify new avenues to
 enhance reprogramming efficiency, uncovering common and cell-type specific regulation of cell identity.
2. The identification of new, more effective reprogramming cocktails represents a current gap in cell
 engineering. We hypothesize that expanded cocktails of precisely delivered TFs targeting the gene
 regulatory networks controlling terminal cell identity will more faithfully reprogram fate. However, it is currently
 experimentally and computationally intractable to predict these cocktails de novo. We will use cell fusion in
 combination with our genomic technologies to empirically deconstruct gene regulation, providing unique
 insights into efficient and accurate reprogramming, informing the development of novel TF cocktails.
 The outcomes of this research will have significant impacts on multiple levels: a) It will facilitate improved
conversion efficiency and fidelity across different cell engineering strategies, overcoming a current barrier in
regenerative medicine; b) The experimental manipulation of cell fate offers a valuable model system to
deconstruct and model dynamic changes in cell identity. Our study of diverse reprogramming strategies will
uncover general and cell type-specific rules for cell fate specification and maintenance, providing broad biological
relevance beyond cell engineering; c) We will continue to develop our innovative genomic technologies, which
provide insight into the regulation of cell identity across diverse cell biology paradigms."

The University of Minnesota (UMN) Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) has the capacity
and the opportunity to support the investigation of animal foodborne illness through the FDA
CVM Vet-LIRN program, most specifically in the area of bacterial contamination."
10845262,"ABSTRACT
The OVDL wishes to continue our cooperative agreement with the Vet-LIRN to help provide essential rapid
communication, coordination, testing, and surge capacity necessary to support the FDA’s response to a
contamination event, disease surveillance and method development. The requested funds will help offset costs
incurred as the OVDL expands its on-going state-supported animal health diagnostic and surveillance activities
to include supporting the mission of the Vet-LIRN. This will be accomplished by the OVDL’s participation in
three major efforts:
1. Participation in FDA/Vet-LIRN sample analysis: The OVDL will provide experienced microbiologists,
pathologists, and lab technicians, as well as administrative personnel, to assist FDA/Vet-LIRN during food/drug
emergencies. This will include surveillance testing as designated by the VPO, outbreak testing, and surge
capacity in times of need.
2. Providing analytical data for potential regulatory use: The OVDL will utilize standardized methods,
equipment platforms, and reporting methods for specimen testing. OVDL personnel will participate in method
training and proficiency testing as directed by the VPO. The OVDL’s quality program will
be complemented by standardized quality management systems required by participation in the FDA/Vet-LIRN
program.
3. Participate in small scale method development, method validation, and matrix extension as determined by
the VPO: Experienced OVDL personnel appropriate to the discipline will participate in method development
and validation, and matrix extension, to support the growth of the Vet-LIRN response network.
The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (OVDL) wishes to continue our collaboration with the Food and
Drug Administration Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) wherein the OVDL
will provide sample analysis, analytical data for regulatory use, and support for small scale method
development and validation. These veterinary diagnostic testing activities support the Vet-LIRN’s objectives of
facilitating early detection of animal food/drug adulteration or contamination as a component of the FDA’s
overall responsibilities in these endeavors. Surveillance and testing for feed contamination in our animal

10849730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral diagnosis, is a
heterogeneous disorder linked to poor adult outcomes including high rates of academic underachievement,
mental illness, substance abuse, and criminal activity. A critical obstacle to improving long-term ADHD
outcomes is the current lack of quantitative neurophysiologic markers that could be used to improve precision
treatment (behavioral and pharmacologic). In research funded during two grant periods, we addressed this
barrier: Leveraging observed associations of ADHD-associated impairments in motor control with core
impairments in cognitive and emotional control to pursue motor physiologic biomarkers linked to ADHD
diagnosis and symptom severity. Engaging expertise of two research teams in different cities, we developed,
refined, and effectively implemented innovative methods for evaluating motor physiology in school-age children
with ADHD. During the first grant period we initiated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) investigations of
motor cortex, discovering that Short Interval Cortical Inhibition (SICI) is reduced in children with ADHD and that
this reduced SICI correlates with parent-ratings of ADHD symptom severity, with consistent findings across the
two sites. During the second grant period, we developed (TMS-compatible) child-friendly games as paradigms
for evaluation of motor cortex physiology under conditions requiring cognitive and emotional control. We found
that SICI is reduced in children with ADHD during action selection and inhibition (as well as rest). Further, we
discovered that TMS-evoked increases in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from rest to task
engagement (which we have denoted as “Task Related Up Modulation” - TRUM) are significantly diminished in
ADHD. Interestingly, while both TRUM and SICI robustly correlate with ADHD severity, they show limited
correlation with each other. These published findings, in conjunction promising preliminary analyses of TMS-
behavioral associations, suggest a model in which these two promising, distinct physiologic biomarkers reflect
differential domains of dysfunction in ADHD, with SICI reflecting mechanisms linked to maintaining attention
and filtering distractions, while TRUM reflects the capacity to modulate response control particularly under
cognitively and emotionally demanding conditions. To pursue validation of SICI and TRUM as physiologic
biomarkers, we now propose: AIM 1 To establish test-retest reliability of SICI and TRUM in children with ADHD
and typically developing (TD) controls. AIM 2 To quantify stimulant treatment-induced changes in SICI and
TRUM in children with ADHD as a validation of utility of these biomarkers for treatment focused studies. AIM 3
To explore the differential association of SICI and TRUM with ADHD-relevant RDoC constructs of Cognitive
Control and Emotional Positive/Negative Valence. Achieving these aims will lay groundwork for future use of
SICI and TRUM as a pragmatic and biologically meaningful quantitative measure that can be applied to
investigations of precision ADHD treatment, genetics, and risk factors for serious long-term outcomes."
10849784,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Molecular Epidemiology in Children’s Environmental Health (MECEH) Training Program began July, 2001
and is in its 20th training year. MECEH is defined as the use of biological, molecular and biostatistical
measures in epidemiological research to determine how environmental exposures impact children’s health at
the physiologic, behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels. The marriage of epidemiology, medicine, statistical
genetics, molecular biology, molecular genetics, and molecular epidemiology serves as an umbrella for
focused research in environmental epidemiology, biomarkers and genetics. MECEH has four participating
departments/programs: Environmental and Public Health Sciences, Pediatrics, psychiatry and behavioral
neuroscience, and the Cincinnati Medical Scientist Training Program. MECEH has had a continuous full
enrollment with 27 Predoctoral and 53 Postdoctoral Fellows, including 39 MD/DO fellows. Trainees have made
great professional strides with national presentations, numerous publications, grant submissions and obtaining
academic, government and industrial research positions. This application requests support for 4 predoctoral
and 6 postdoctoral positions each year for 2022-2027, to maintain its current size.
The MECEH Training Program’s long-term objective is to continue to increase the number of cross-trained
epidemiologists, physician-scientists, biostatisticians, and molecular biologists who investigate high impact
issues related to environmental exposures and complex childhood diseases. The overarching rationale for this
program is that training in molecular epidemiology is not only vital to our understanding of the origin of complex
disease by providing clues regarding specific mechanisms, molecules and genes that influence risk but also
provides a framework for interdisciplinary training for a new generation of pediatric researchers to perform this
work. Thus, the MECEH Training Program has three primary goals: 1) provide a strong grounding in
epidemiologic, biostatistical, and molecular methods; 2) prepare students for interdisciplinary research and
“enhance clinical research workforce training,” as stated in the NIH roadmap; 3) expand growth areas for
epidemiological training in epigenomics/’omics’ and community based participatory research; and 4) provide
career development programming to promote career success and sustainability. These goals are achieved
through the recruitment of high quality applicants, including underrepresented minorities, leadership and
mentorship by a core of nationally- and internationally- renowned scientists, support by research-intensive
departments; well-funded scientific programs and centers; and advise from a distinguished and enthusiastic
External Advisory Board."
10849861,"Project Summary/Abstract
There is an urgent need to create sustainable systems to facilitate the success of diverse faculty, particularly
because the diseases central to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK) disproportionately impact populations of color. Thus, we propose a comprehensive program
to facilitate the success of diverse faculty engaged in research that is directly responsive to the mission of NIDDK
and that builds on the extensive infrastructure already in place within and across our institutions. We draw upon
established collaborations through our NIDDK-funded University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Nutrition
Obesity Research Center (UNC-NORC) (P30DK056350, PI Mayer-Davis) and our North Carolina Diabetes
Research Center (NC-DRC) (P30DK124723, PI McClain) to include three R-1, predominately white institutions
– Duke University, UNC, and Wake Forest University School of Medicine – and three Historically Black
Colleges/Universities: North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T), North Carolina
Central University, and Winston-Salem State University. Led by MPIs Elizabeth J. Mayer-Davis, PhD, RD, (UNC,
UNC-NORC PI) and Elimelda Moige Ongeri, PhD, (NC A&T, PI of NC-DRC for NC A&T), we propose the North
Carolina Consortium for Diversity Career Development in Nutrition, Obesity, and Diabetes Research
(NC(CD)2NOD).
We aim to build on established infrastructure to develop key program components and a rigorous evaluation
plan (Year 1) that ensures continuous quality improvement (Years 2-5) of the NC(CD)2NOD that will support the
success of diverse scientists in the conduct of research in nutrition, obesity, diabetes, and related conditions.
We will establish three cohorts of scholars (total n=20) (Year 2, Years 3-4) and execute programmatic activities
(Years 2-5). Scholars will be selected competitively and will include senior post-doctoral scholars and early
career faculty members from underrepresented groups across our six institutions. Each scholar will have a
dedicated primary mentor and mentoring team as well as access to carefully curated programs for professional
development that will unfold over the two-year program. The required deliverable for our program is an NIH
proposal (K or R-level, as appropriate to career stage) for which substantial training and mentoring will be
provided. Finally, we will offer a robust P&F Program (Years 1-5) with two levels of funding that will 1) enable
collection of preliminary data to support external proposal submissions (up to $50,000 per award) and 2) enhance
research success by providing targeted support for equipment, lab supplies, trainings, etc. (up to $10,000 per
award). Building on our substantial existing NIDDK infrastructure and research funding, as well as supplemental
institutional financial support for this proposal, the NC(CD)2NOD will markedly enhance the diversity of the
research workforce, preparing scholars to make substantial scientific contributions via independent NIH research
funding in the critical areas of nutrition, obesity, diabetes, and related conditions for years to come."

The Animal Core (Core C) will provide centralized services by generating all the mice
needed for the Center projects. A centralized supply of mice by the Core will ensure that
mice with the same genetic background are used to minimize potential variations in
phenotypic, genomic or epigenomic analyses. The fact that Core personnel are well
trained for HFD treatment, skillful in monitoring development and health status, and
measurement of GTT and ITT will ensure consistent data quality and reproducibility.
Specifically, Core C will generate high fat diet (HFD)- and normal diet (ND)-fed wild-type
and transgenic mice, collect phenotypic data and prepare sperm and tissue samples for
the two basic projects. Both projects 2 and 3 will work on effects of HFD and/or inactivity
on sperm epigenome and offspring health. Both WT or transgenic (TU tracer and
KitcopGFP) mice will be on a HFD or a ND for 3 months, and Project 3 also needs to
reverse the HFD effect by feeding HFD-treated mice with ND and introducing to a
running wheel. To analyze the effects of altered sperm epigenome in response to HFD
and/or exercise, the treated male mice need to be bred with WT female mice to generate
F1 progeny. Core C will maintain the mouse colonies, perform all the treatments, collect
phenotypic data and provide sperm and tissue samples needed for the experiments
proposed in Projects 2 and 3."

Required to visualize the world around us, photoreceptors are post-mitotic retinal neurons that
must remain healthy and functional to respond to incoming light. Throughout a lifetime,
photoreceptors require high amounts of energy and are robust amongst various stressors
including high reactive oxygen species and light radiation. Dysfunctional photoreceptor
mitochondria can lead to disrupted or complete vision loss. Uncovering mechanisms supporting
mitochondrial dynamics during stress will yield insight into photoreceptor longevity. Developing
therapies for visual disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunction first requires an understanding
of mitochondrial dynamics in stressed and unstressed conditions. Zebrafish are ideal model
organisms as their cone photoreceptors contain a large cluster of mitochondria localized to the
cell body. In response to energy demands throughout the 24-hour day, the mitochondrial cluster
grows or shrinks accordingly. Rarely mitochondria move away from this cluster towards the
synapse or outside the photoreceptor cell. The presence of mitochondria localized away from the
cluster is increased in stressed conditions. Moving unhealthy mitochondria away from the healthy
cluster may be a specialized stress response to protect photoreceptors. It is currently unknown
how photoreceptor mitochondria are anchored or move. In aim 1 of this proposal, I will uncover
how the mitochondrial cluster is anchored in photoreceptors and how mitochondria can break free
from that cluster and move towards the synapse. Photoreceptor mitochondria have been
observed outside the photoreceptor layer and a portion of photoreceptor mitochondria colocalized
with Müller glia. Some ‘mislocalized’ photoreceptor mitochondria colocalized with Lysotracker
Green puncta within and outside the photoreceptor layer indicating mitochondrial turnover. In aim
2 of this proposal, I will determine the cell type(s) responsible for photoreceptor mitochondrial
turnover. I predict that unhealthy mitochondria are separated from the cluster and ejected from
the cell to be turned over by Müller glia machinery. Understanding the mechanisms of this stress
response will give insight into how photoreceptors remain robust throughout time. These findings
can yield insights into how retinal therapies can target mitochondrial dysfunction in
photoreceptors."
10854763,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of this Chemistry-Biology Interface (CBI) training program is to prepare 10
predoctoral students to become next-generation scientists in the biomedical sciences. This goal will be
achieved through recruiting top students and training them in cross-disciplinary research, critical thinking,
writing and communication, rigorous experiment design and interpretation, and responsible conduct of
research. Other distinctive components of the program are: a) a course on cutting-edge research at the CBI, b)
workshops on entrepreneurship, intellectual property management, and networking, and c) participation in
Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) experiences, which will further enrich the skillset and professional preparation
of the trainees. The program will directly benefit from the close research relationship and physical proximity
between Arts, Sciences, & Engineering (AS&E) and the School of Medicine and Dentistry (SMD) at the
University of Rochester, and its established record in innovation and entrepreneurial translation of scientific
discoveries into new businesses. The program includes 27 outstanding preceptors selected from six
departments within AS&E and SMD, all of whom have a strong record of intra- and interdepartmental
interactions in research and mentoring activities. A central theme of the program, as shared by the research
interests of the preceptors, is the development of fundamental knowledge and strategies to support the
generation, development, and delivery of new therapeutic agents and modalities for the prevention and
treatment of human diseases. Trainees will conduct research in one of the four main areas around this unifying
theme: Synthetic Chemistry, Drug Discovery & Delivery, Drug Target Identification and Sensing, and Structure
and Function of Biomolecules & Biomaterials. The Program Director and two Deputy Directors will be aided by
a Steering Committee comprising three additional faculty members. The CBI trainees will be drawn from the
strongest students in the participating departments, with a particular emphasis on expanding trainee diversity
through outreach activities, recruiting a diverse pool of applicants, and retaining and nurturing students in the
program. New CBI trainees will start in Year 2 of their graduate studies and will participate in the core CBI
courses, a course on responsible conduct of research, and a course on effective writing and communication.
All trainees will participate and contribute to a host of CBI-sponsored enrichment and synergistic activities,
including professional development workshops, an annual retreat, and monthly CBI lunches. In Year 4 of their
PhD program, trainees will serve as PLTL workshop leaders for CBI courses, continue in professional
development, and present a talk at the CBI retreat. Trainees also will complete and defend their theses
supervised by one of the CBI preceptors. It is expected that students completing this program will be
exceptionally well prepared to pursue a variety of careers in the life and biomedical sciences. Success in this
program will also be determined by increased diversity of trainees and in the pool of applicants."

 Our work funded by this RO1 during this last funding cycle has established that endogenous hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) produced by selective upregulated H2S synthesizing enzyme cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is
a new uterine artery (UA) dilator system contributing to estrogen-induced and pregnancy-associated rises in
uterine blood flow. This novel pathway has reshaped the view how uterine hemodynamics is regulated during
normal pregnancy. More recently, we reported that H2S stimulates human UA relaxation via activating smooth
muscle (SM) large conductance Ca2+-activated voltage-gated potassium (BKCa) channels; yet, how H2S
mediates estrogen-induced UA dilation in normal and complicated pregnancies remains largely unknown.
Formation of -SSH groups on reactive cysteine(s) in proteins, referred to as sulfhydration or persulfidation,
has emerged as the main signaling route for H2S to exert its biological function. Sulfhydration converts free
thiols (-SH) to persulfide (-SSH) resulting in increased reactivity of modified cysteines due to increased
nucleophilicity of SSH compared with SH. In this competitive renewal RO1 application, we present new data
showing that estrogen and pregnancy can significantly stimulate protein sulfhydration in human UA; and more
interestingly, the elevated levels of total sulfhydrated proteins and sulfhydrated β1 and γ1 subunits of BKCa
channels in human UA in normal pregnancy is significantly reduced in preeclampsia. Thus, we propose to
test a novel hypothesis herein that augmented CBS/H2S sulfhydrates the increased β1 and γ1 BKCa (via
estrogen receptor-dependent transcription) resulting in activation of SM BKCa to mediate estrogen-induced
UA dilation in normal pregnancy and this mechanism is impaired in preeclampsia. This conjecture will be
tested by two specific aims targeting on determining the estrogen-responsive BKCa channels and how
sulfhydration results in activation of these BKCa channels pertaining to UA dilation in pregnancy and
preeclampsia, with comprehensive biochemical, cellular, molecular, pharmacological, and physiological and
electrophysiology approaches using in vitro primary cell culture models of UA smooth muscle cells, ex vivo
studies of human main UA samples associated with different estrogens status from hysterectomy and
myometrial UA samples from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies, and in vivo rat models to study the role
of exogenous and endogenous estrogens in vivo. The proposed studies will establish a novel mechanism for
BKCa channel activation via sulfhydrating its regulatory β1 and γ1 subunits to broadly impact on ion channel
biology. These studies will comprehend specific mechanisms for activation of the estrogen-responsive SM
BKCa channels pertaining to estrogen-induced UA dilation in pregnancy and preeclampsia. Data obtained will
advance our understanding of estrogens and uterine blood flow biology, informing new pathways to assist the
development of alternative strategies for combating preeclampsia. New data obtained will also shed lights
on the understanding of the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogens.

10854769,"Project Background
Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the gold standard evidence-based psychotherapy for OCD;
however, few Veterans receive ERP and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published
examining the effectiveness of ERP among Veterans or in individuals with comorbid OCD and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). OCD impacts work, social, and family functioning, such that 38% of people with OCD
are unable to work due to the severity of symptoms and 25% attempt suicide at some point in their lives
(Mancebo et al., 2008). It is essential to examine the effectiveness of ERP in Veteran specific trials because
Veterans are a complex, highly comorbid population, and have significant trauma histories which can
complicate ERP treatment. Many Veterans face logistic barriers to accessing therapy including transportation,
distance, childcare, and work, in addition to challenges leaving the home due to OCD symptoms. Video
telehealth (VTH) can increase Veterans’ access to ERP and may enhance the generalizability of exposures
since in-home exposure exercises can focus on OCD triggers that people encounter in their home
environment. This may mean more direct impact to the Veteran’s daily life functioning and quality of life.
Project Objectives
The proposed 4-year multisite RCT will compare outcomes of VTH-delivered ERP to those of a stress
management training control condition among 160 Veterans with OCD. Half of the sample with have comorbid
PTSD. The primary aim will examine whether participants’ functioning, quality of life, and OCD symptoms differ
as a function of the intervention (ERP vs. control). The secondary aim will examine these outcomes among the
half of the sample with comorbid OCD and PTSD. The tertiary aim is to conduct a mixed-methods formative
evaluation of the implementation potential of ERP in VA mental health settings.
Project Methods
Eligible Veteran participants will be randomized to ERP or to the control condition. Veterans randomized to
ERP will receive 16 weekly ERP sessions delivered via VTH. Control participants will receive 16 weekly
sessions of a stress management training intervention delivered via VTH. Participants in both conditions will
complete assessments at post-treatment and 6 months after completing treatment. Participants in the ERP
condition will also complete an assessment of treatment satisfaction and a qualitative exit interview assessing
the Veterans’ perceptions of the impact of treatment on multiple domains of functioning, including the impact
on PTSD symptoms. Providers and VA administrators will participate in qualitative interviews regarding the
implementation potential of ERP in VA.
Contribution to VHA
This work addresses RR&D clinical priorities related to cognitive-behavioral interventions for improving
Veterans’ functioning, participation in society, and quality of life. Establishing ERP as an evidence-based
treatment in the complex Veteran population has the potential to impact the 170,000 Veterans in VHA with
OCD and assist them in living more functional lives, which will affect their families, children, workplaces, and
communities."
10854874,"The US opioid overdose death epidemic has continued for over 20 years. Nonmetropolitan or rural areas with
low capabilities of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment are associated with significantly elevated rates of opioid
overdose deaths. Many countries have increased OUD treatment access to reduce opioid morbidity by allowing
community pharmacy dispensing of methadone for methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). MMT has been
the most studied and longest utilized OUD treatment for about 55+ years. Federal regulations require MMT to
be provided through one of about 1,860 SAMHSA certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs). MMT is
considered less expensive (more affordable) and has higher treatment retention rates than buprenorphine
treatment for OUD. Thus, MMT is a preferred treatment option for many individuals with OUD.
However, the limited number of OPTs, limited capabilities of existing OTPs, and a long travel distance to an OTP
are major barriers to accessing MMT, especially for persons with OUD in rural and suburban areas. Pharmacists
are among the most trusted healthcare professionals. About 90% of Americans live within 5 miles of a community
pharmacy. Federal regulations allow OTPs to obtain approvals to establish methadone medication units (MUs)
at pharmacies (pharmacy MUs) to allow pharmacy administration and dispensing of methadone for MMT to
expand treatment. MUs are managed by OTP directors of the parent OTP who have oversight of patient care at
both the main OTP and MU location. MUs have been infrequently utilized in the US. Given the serious shortage
of OUD providers in the US to address the escalating opioid overdose death epidemic, there is an urgent need
to identify useful strategies of establishing MUs and to disseminate useful strategies of establishing MUs
nationally to OTP directors and community pharmacists in the US.
Built on the successful experience of the PI’s (Dr. Wu) research on developing physician-community pharmacist
collaborative care models to engage community pharmacists in providing buprenorphine treatment care to
patients with OUD (Wu et al., 2021a) and administration and dispensing of methadone for MMT (Wu et al.,
2021b), we will conduct a survey of OTP directors (n=586) and community pharmacists (n=586) to identify OTP
and community pharmacy facility/practice, individual, and contextual factors that are related to intentions to
establish a MU. Guided by a mixed methods explanatory sequential design, we will also conduct follow-up
qualitative interviews of a subsample of participants from each survey to further obtain in-depth data on MU
implementation barriers and facilitators in the US.
Due to the serious shortage of OUD providers and escalating rates of opioid deaths, this study is time-sensitive.
This study will be the first effort in the US to identify MU implementation barriers and facilitators from both OTP
directors and pharmacists. We will produce multiple peer-reviewed publications and an electronic toolkit for
establishing MUs to quickly disseminate the toolkit and publications to OTP directors and pharmacists nationally."

compartments that align with the temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing – RT). However,
little is known about the mechanisms underlying 3D genome organization. Recently, we identified cis
elements of RT and 3D genome organization control (early replicating control elements – ERCEs) in
murine embryonic stem cells. ERCEs are enriched in enhancer epigenetic marks, form strong chromatin
interactions and are bound by pluripotency-specific transcription factors. Moreover, I developed an
integrative model of gene regulatory networks that predicts that co-occupancy of cell type-specific
transcription factors regulate RT. Here, we will study what are the regulatory elements of genome
organization in human differentiated cell types, investigate how trans-acting factors control these
elements, and define how 3D genome organization is remodeled during development and evolution.
Our central hypothesis is that co-occupancy of cell type-specific transcription factors at ERCEs
is required to regulate the 3D genome organization. To test this hypothesis, we will delete and insert
candidate ERCEs into the genome of human differentiated cell types and test their effect on RT, 3D
genome organization and gene expression. We will track ERCE activation using highly-synchronous
human embryonic stem cells differentiation systems. Finally, we will analyze 3D genome organization
evolution using primary cells derived from different species. My laboratory is uniquely positioned to
perform the proposed research with broad expertise in the experimental design and analysis of 3D
genome organization during human cell fate commitment. Moreover, numerous resources available at
the University of Minnesota will facilitate the success of this project, including state-of-the-art
technologies for genome editing (Genome Engineering Shared Resource), next-generation sequencing
(Genomics Center), stem cells (Stem Cell Institute), imaging (Imaging Center) and bioinformatic tools
(Minnesota Supercomputing Institute). We expect that our work will contribute significantly to understand
the fundamental principles of genome organization and its relationship to gene function. The proposed
research combines several innovative aspects such as integrative computational models to predict
regulatory elements of large-scale chromatin organization, genome engineering technologies and
optimized differentiation protocols of human embryonic stem cells to dissect the mechanisms that
control 3D genome organization during development and evolution."
10862586,"This application is conceived on the premise that in certain diseases, e.g. peripheral artery disease (PAD),
traditional therapies are ineffective in the treatment of symptoms and related morbidities. PAD currently impacts
over 8 million Americans and will affect many more as our nation ages. The health care costs to treat subjects
are significant ($4 billion annually by Medicare), with most patients requiring numerous endovascular and
surgical procedures including amputation. Medical therapy has failed to impact the trend in this cost and efficacy
curve. This proposal seeks to change this paradigm by recognizing the endothelial dysfunction attributed to PAD
prevents proper blood flow recovery because the production of nitric oxide through its cognate enzyme nitric
oxide synthase is impaired. We have found nitric oxide (NO) precursors formed within endothelial vesicles to be
stimulated by red light energy to release NO and produce a stable NO bound vasodilator. Most importantly the
production and release of this autocrine factor dilates arteries/arterioles in the absence of nitric oxide synthase
(NOS). The actions of red light are clinically relevant, as we have identified significant elevations in blood flow
when the gastrocnemius muscle of healthy subjects and patients with PAD are exposed to red light. The
approach in this application will be to assess the production of these thiol based NO vesicles in healthy conditions
and oxidative stress by using ex vivo and cell culture techniques, characterize the intracellular mechanism for
vesicle transport and release of the NO precursor vesicle, and confirm our findings in vessels obtained from
human subjects with and without diseases predisposed to oxidative stress. We expect the data collected will
identify the mechanisms by which vesicles containing NO precursor molecules can be increased, improve
endothelial dysfunction and enhance perfusion. RELEVANCE TO VETERANS: PAD is a costly and highly
morbid disease which disproportionately affects our veterans. Red light has the potential to noninvasively
increase blood flow through the manipulation of intracellular NO precursors produced in vesicles. This finding is
a novel intervention which has great potential to reduce costs and improve symptoms by avoiding morbid surgical
procedures. The broader clinical impact of red light therapy cannot be fully realized until the mechanism by which
red light releases this vasodilator mechanism is identified."
10862730,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, are implicated in the pathophysiology of
chronic ischemic cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), a clinically
important cause of dementia that preferentially affects white matter (WM). Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSF1R) is a key regulator of myeloid lineage cells. Genetic loss of CSF1R blocks the normal population of
resident microglia and systemic treatment with CSF1R antagonists such as PLX5622 results in a marked
depletion of microglia in the CNS. Here we propose to evaluate the role of microglia and CSF1R signaling
in a novel rodent model of CSVD/VCI developed in the laboratory of our colleague Dr. Edith Hamel
(McGill University). Mice overexpressing transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFOE) and fed a high cholesterol
diet (HCD) display impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, diffuse leukoencephalopathy, and cognitive dysfunction
that resembles human CSVD/VCI. We will first assess effects of TGFOE and HCD on regional and cell type
specific gene expression in microglia and other myeloid cells using single cell RNA sequencing. Next we will
determine if treatment with PLX5622 influences neurological, neuroimaging, and/or neurovascular
outcomes in TGFOE mice (+/-HCD). We will assess longitudinal WM integrity outcomes using state-of-
the-art 14 Tesla MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative tractography. We will also use
sophisticated assessments of resting-state functional connectivity (optical imaging of intrinsic signals) and
neurocognition. Furthermore, we will perform longitudinal 2-photon brain imaging studies to track changes in
the cerebrovasculature during critical periods of CSVD/ VCI disease initiation and progression. We will
confirm the microglia-specific nature of our findings using an orthogonal genetic approach by crossing
TGFOE mice with a Csf1rflox/flox : HexbCreERT2 bigenic line that exhibits stable, microglia-specific knockdown of
Csf1r. We will then feed the trigenic TGFOE : Csf1rflox/flox : HexbCreERT2 line HCD and carry out the same
comprehensive set of longitudinal parameters described above. We anticipate that both pharmacologic
depletion of microglia and genetic deletion of CSF1R signaling specifically in microglia will attenuate WM
inflammation and injury and result in improvement in multiple outcome parameters. In aim 3 we will collaborate
with our colleagues in Radiology to use a novel CSF1R radioligand to carry out longitudinal positron
emission tomography (PET) on TGFOE mice (+/-HCD) at multiple time points during disease initiation and
progression. This will provide critical information on temporal and spatial in vivo expression patterns of
CSF1R in the context of CSVD/VCI and generate foundational data for a novel biomarker for
neuroinflammation that can be readily scaled up from mouse to humans. Overall, this microglia- and CSF1R
signaling-targeted, WM-centric approach will provide important mechanistic information on the pathogenesis of
ischemic WM injury in CSVD/VCI and elucidate new potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

 Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is a major cardiovascular health problem characterized by
a dilated aorta that may eventually dissect or rupture. ATAA presents a serious challenge in that the surgery is
difficult and dangerous, so aneurysm repair criteria must balance the risk of a dissection and/or rupture with
the risk of surgery. Current surgical guidelines are based on ATAA diameter or growth rate, but up to 60% of
patients with an ATAA experience a dissection before surgical criteria are reached, hence there is a clear need
for additional biomarkers of aneurysm failure. Possible biomarkers fall into broad categories including genetic,
microstructural, geometrical, and biofluids, but it is challenging to obtain enough human data to calculate and
correlate these biomarkers with critical outcomes such as failure. It is likely that a single biomarker is not
sufficient, but composite biomarkers that are not intuitively obvious may be necessary for significant predictions
of patient outcomes. In this proposal we will use a combination of models: 1) a mouse model of ATAA
associated with Marfan Syndrome, 2) a multiscale, multiphysics model of ATAA growth and remodeling, and 3)
virtual patient models derived from real patient imaging data, to determine composite biomarkers that may
predict ATAA growth, progression, and failure. Our first Specific Aim is to use a genetic mouse model of ATAA
associated with Marfan Syndrome to characterize aneurysm progression and failure in previously unachieved
detail, quantifying aortic shape, tissue composition, tissue mechanical properties, and hemodynamics over
time. This level of detail is not possible in human patients and is necessary to validate and test hypotheses on
the growth and remodeling rules in our multiscale, multiphysics model in Specific Aim 2 and to provide an initial
set of biomarkers to evaluate for our virtual patients in Specific Aim 3. Our second Specific Aim is to develop a
novel multiscale, multiphysics computational model of ATAA growth and remodeling to produce results that will
be compared to the mouse data in Specific Aim 1 and used to predict remodeling progression in real and
virtual human patients in Specific Aim 3. In our third Specific Aim, we will use available human ATAA scans
from Marfan Syndrome patients to generate a statistical shape model basis for the ATAA geometry, and we will
use that basis to generate virtual patients, whose TAA course throughout progression and failure will be
created by the model in Specific Aim 2, with parameters determined from published literature and our mouse
data in Specific Aim 1. Both real and virtual patient data will then be used to train a machine learning tool to
relate the composite biomarkers to the remodeling outcomes and predict failure risk. This plan synthesizes
multiple recent advances and supplements them with new ideas to produce a computer system capable of
making useful failure predictions for ATAA."
10862735,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adult stem cells are crucial for regeneration, tissue repair after injury, and developmental processes such as
spermatogenesis. These cells ensure both tissue growth and renewal by dividing asymmetrically, producing
one daughter stem cell and one daughter that differentiates 1,2. Stem cells exist in a dynamic
microenvironment termed the niche that provides signals to ensure the maintenance and self-renewal of the
adult stem cell population1–5. An appreciation of the dynamic communication between stem cells and their
niche is vital to understand processes such as reproduction, oncogenesis, aging, development, and
regeneration. Much is known about signals sent from niche cells and received by stem cells3,6–13; however,
little is known about signaling in the opposite direction: from stem cells back to their niche. Here, I use the
testis stem cell niche of Drosophila melanogaster to explore signaling from stem cells back to their niche as
well as the role of endocytic tumor suppressor genes in this signaling. Endocytosis regulates a myriad of
signaling pathways14–18. My preliminary data indicate that knockdown of an endocytic gene in somatic stem
cells greatly increases the size of adjacent niche cells and, consequently, the niche itself. Since the way that
endocytic genes non-autonomously regulate niche size is unknown, but may apply widely to other niches. In
Aim 1, I further characterize this phenotype by assessing the role of endocytosis in mediating signaling within
the Drosophila testis stem cell niche. I will specifically knock down genes regulating endocytosis from cyst
stem cells and characterize the resultant changes in neighboring niche cells, focusing on niche cell size,
morphology, and ploidy. I will also examine the activity of a small set of well-characterized signaling pathways
involved in cell growth in wild-type and endocytic mutant testes. I will follow up with genetic loss and gain-of-
funditon analysis for pathways with changes such as the JAK-STAT pathway (preliminary data). In Aim 2, I
more broadly investigate signaling from other cells to the niche cells by performing a screen of candidate niche
cell signaling pathway receptors identified in our recent single-cell transcriptomic datasets. This will greatly
expand our understanding of the signaling pathways requred for niche cell fate, function, size and/or
quiescence. Overall, these proposed experiments will further illuminate cell signaling dynamics within the
Drosophila testis stem cell niche, with implications for niches in other tissues and organisms.
I will conduct this work in the lab of Dr. Erika Matunis at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where I have
access to over 50 departmental and core facilities and resources including Drosophila media, flow cytometry,
microscopy, genetics and genomics, and a supportive mentoring team. I will supplement my research training
by strengthening my quantitative skills through workshops and courses, and my communication skills through
grant and manuscript writing and presentations at conferences. Furthermore, I will gain teaching experience
by serving as a teaching assistant and mentoring undergraduates in the lab."
10862873,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
To optimally support global child health and development, research needs to be designed to account for the
scale of disease burden and child mortality that occurs worldwide. A robust global pediatric health research
strategy depends upon new investigators with the technical expertise required to translate basic science to
population health and wellness. Although the US leads the world in biomedical research, none of the 39 NIH
funded global health institutional training grants are focused solely on improving health for children in
low- and middle-income countries, and none are from NICHD. General pediatric global health fellowships limit
career opportunities for clinician scientists, further restricting researchers to high income health systems.
We will capitalize on the significant teaching and research resources that exist across Stanford University to
develop the next generation of pediatric subspecialty global health researchers. We propose a dual
fellowship training approach which will encompass both the trainee’s pediatric subspecialty as well as
a focus on global health approaches to subspecialty research. Resources such as the co-located seven
schools which make up teaching and research at Stanford University, as well as the surrounding Silicon
Valley, offers a unique entrepreneurial and technologically innovative environment, will serve as the hub of an
interdisciplinary environment to build a cross-cutting research program addressing the needs of children in low-
and middle-income countries. The program PI has directed T32 programs for over a decade and is the
School of Medicine Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Development and Diversity, so is well-positioned to
provide substantial mentorship and leadership resources for the trainees. Stanford has a group of highly
experienced and well-funded global child health researchers with substantial mentorship and clinical
experience who work across the spectrum of low- and middle-income countries. Finally, the proposal includes
a unique pediatric subspecialty global health curriculum that integrates with existing rigorous coursework
and a Master’s in Epidemiology program to provide the foundation for the proposed training program.
Two Stanford pediatric subspecialty fellows will be selected per year, beginning in their second year of
training. Trainees will: (1) complete a Master of Science in Epidemiology and Clinical Research; (2) receive
structured dual-mentorship by both subspecialty and global child health researchers; (3) design and complete
a hypothesis-driven research project; (4) attend interactive research working groups; and (5) participate in the
Department of Pediatrics highly successful grant writing programs. This comprehensive program will train a
new generation of pediatric subspecialty global health scientists equipped to advance the research agenda
outlined in the NICHD Scientific Vision."

10860347,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is rapidly becoming the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and
mortality in the developed world. The transition from hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis is thought to involve
dysregulation of mitochondrial function and lipotoxicity, however precise molecular mechanism of “second hit” in
driving disease remains elusive. Mitochondria, abundant in the liver, share structural similarities with bacteria
and their components can be recognized as “danger signals” if released from damaged cell. Mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) is a major biologically active component of mitochondria that shares structural similarities with bacterial
DNA and is well recognized to alert immune system if released from mitochondria of injured cell. The mechanistic
role of extracellular mtDNA in liver fibrosis is still obscure.
We have developed novel assays for sensitive and reliable mtDNA measurements in biological samples,
methodology to generate biologically active mtDNA preparations at large scale for in vivo and in vitro studies,
and recently discovered the direct role of mtDNA in driving hepatic fibrosis. Our preliminary data indicate that
mtDNA is released from hepatocytes under lipotoxic conditions in apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1(Ask1)-
dependent manner, circulates in serum of NASH patients, and triggers hepatic fibrosis via activation of hepatic
stellate cells via STING-dependent pathway.
Based on our preliminary data, we propose the original hypothesis that circulating mtDNA species released
from injured hepatocytes are a central driver and biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis progression in NAFLD,
which we will address by pursuing three independent, but integrated specific aims:
Aim 1. Study the role of Ask1 and related signaling pathways in regulating mtDNA release from
hepatocytes under lipotoxic conditions.
Aim 2. Define intracellular signaling pathways that mediate mtDNA-elicited pro-fibrogenic effects in
hepatic stellate cells.
Aim 3. Interrogate the relationship between circulating mtDNA levels and progression of NAFLD/NASH.
We will use a mechanistic approach to elucidate the role of hepatocyte-derived mtDNA species play in the
pathogenesis of NASH progression by eliciting specific pro-fibrogenic responses. Understanding of this novel
pathway may lead to a paradigm shift with direct diagnostic and therapeutic implications for NASH. To this end,
our long-term goal is to develop non-invasive mtDNA-based diagnostics and discover novel therapeutic targets
to prevent or treat NASH."
10838356,"SUMMARY
Globally, influenza virus is a major public health burden. Evidence suggests that an individual’s earliest
exposures to influenza have profound effects on immunity against the virus throughout life. Well-curated, infant
cohorts, used to interrogate the full spectrum of immune responses against early influenza exposures, and
examined for subsequent exposures have been lacking. Our premise of this proposal is that the antigenic form
(strain, infection vs. vaccination) of an encounter with influenza virus results in disparate immunological memory
profiles, particularly in B and T cell repertoires. Specifically, we will examine how influenza infection- and
vaccination-mediated imprinting modulates the breadth, longevity, and functional quality of B cell and antibody
responses and dictates the specificity, receptor profiles, functional activity and epigenetic state of the T cell
responses to subsequent influenza exposures. In addition, we will examine how these parameters are impacted
by repeated exposure to influenza. We will address these questions by comprehensively assessing the B and T
cell immune responses induced by influenza infection and vaccination in three unique birth cohort studies: 1)
Managua, Nicaragua; 2) Wellington, New Zealand; and 3) Los Angeles, CA. Through the three sites, chosen
because of our extensive experience with conduct of cohort studies and enrollment of infants, distinct seasonal
transmission of influenza, and diverse demographics, we will establish a cohort of ~3,100 children, with 2,100
newborns enrolled over the course of the U01 and an additional ~1,000 children who have already been followed
since birth for up to 8 years for symptomatic influenza infection and have existing banked blood samples. Our
central hypothesis is that the chronology of initial and subsequent influenza exposures has long lasting
effects on anti-influenza responses (“imprinting”), setting infants on diverse immunological trajectories
mediated by the recruitment of distinct B and T cell specificities and functional capabilities. We will test
this hypothesis through establishment of the cohort (Aim 1), examining the response to initial exposures (Aim 2),
examining the response to subsequent exposures (Aim 3) and evaluating correlates of protection (Aim 4). We
have formed a Consortium of world-renowned investigators who have a long history of collaboration (>150
publications). Combining extensive experience and on-going programs in clinical, immunological, and virological
research ensures a high-quality, successful research program. This U01 will result in: 1) New insight on the
mechanisms of imprinting; 2) Improved understanding of what constitutes protective immunity in early and
subsequent influenza infections, including the effects of vaccination; and 3) Identification of natural and vaccine-
induced B cell/antibody and CD4+/CD8+ T cell correlates of protection. These investigations provide a novel
opportunity to combine unique cohorts with exhaustive immune profiling, generating critical insights for new
vaccine strategies to induce broadly protective immunity to influenza virus."

This T32 renewal application from the University of Washington (UW) focuses on a critical and understudied
area of research – palliative care research for heart, lung, and blood diseases. Our aging population and
advances in chronic disease management have combined to create an enormous need for improved palliative
care research across diverse diseases. Heart, lung, and blood diseases encompass leading causes of death
and disability in the US and represent areas where palliative care research lags behind compared to cancer.
This application differs from other T32 programs by focusing on training in palliative care research for patients
with heart, lung, and blood diseases. Because health disparities in palliative care have been well documented,
this innovative training program also focuses on understanding and eliminating these disparities. This proposal
capitalizes on the exceptional faculty and academic environment across multiple schools (Medicine, Nursing,
Public Health, Pharmacy, and Social Work) at the UW, and multiple departments within the UW School of
Medicine. Dr. J. Randall Curtis, the founding program director, is a national leader in palliative care research
and was a recipient of a K24 Award for mentoring from NHLBI for the full 10 years. He is also the Director of
the UW Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence (PCCE) which supports this T32. With this renewal
application, Dr. Curtis is adding two outstanding new program directors, both R01-funded leaders in palliative
care research: Dr. Erin Kross, Director of Research Training for the Cambia PCCE, and Dr. Abby Rosenberg,
Director of Pediatrics for the Cambia PCCE. We propose a rigorous research training program built on four
core principles to prepare new researchers for independent careers: 1) Trainees must master a defined set of
core content and research skills necessary to become independent yet collaborative investigators; 2)
Structured research mentoring and academic career development are critical to retaining trainees in science
careers; 3) Research projects must be tailored to each trainee and designed to be training vehicles that
facilitate early academic productivity and success; 4) Training in palliative care research should provide real
opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions and promote team-science. To continuously improve our
program, we will assess the effectiveness of our methods for training and mentoring using well-defined metrics,
and adjust our methods as necessary. We are requesting the same 4 post-doctoral training slots as our initial
T32. This application represents an important opportunity to advance palliative care research concerning heart,
lung, and blood diseases, to address key compelling questions in the 2016 NHLBI Strategic Vision, and to
create a research workforce for the future."

The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) is the pediatric clinical trials group of the National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN). Over 90% of United States and Canadian children and adolescents with cancer are
treated at COG institutions with no racial, ethnic or geographic bias to registration, allowing for near-
population-based clinical, translational and basic research. COG has established a strong track record of
collecting and banking tumor and non-diseased biospecimens from patients enrolled in COG-sponsored
clinical trials, most of which include randomized treatment questions. The COG Biospecimen Bank (COG
Biobank), located within the Biopathology Center (part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at
Nationwide Children’s Hospital), aims to provide high-quality pediatric and adolescent human malignant
biospecimens to the research community. Upon review and approval, biospecimens are prioritized for
distribution to the COG investigators defined in the clinical trial protocols. After the needs of the planned
research have been addressed, residual (legacy) banked biospecimens can be distributed to other
investigators within and outside COG via the NCTN Navigator The COG Group and Biobank Concierges
can also facilitate access to COG legacy biospecimens that are not currently uploaded in Navigator. For
all biospecimen distribution projects, a feasibility assessment by the COG Biobank and the COG
Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is completed prior to proposal submission. This
proposal supports the collection, processing, and distribution of biospecimens from patient enrolled on
COG-sponsored trials. The Pediatric Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) then
facilitates the distribution of the approved legacy biospecimens.
The COG Biobank seeks to directly promote and support outstanding research in the diagnosis and
treatment of pediatric cancer through centralized collection, quality control, storage, and distribution
procedures. The COG Biobank will continue efforts to provide the latest biorepository-based
technological innovations and best practices, resulting in constant improvements in our operational
capabilities, investigator access to biospecimens, investigator satisfaction, and the stewardship of these
precious resources. Under proper regulatory guidelines and in association with the COG SDMC, the
COG Biobank will support translational aspects of cutting-edge research by ensuring appropriate tracking
of biospecimens as well as linkage to existing demographic, clinical, biological, treatment, and outcome
data. Finally, the COG Biobank will provide investigators with a comprehensive database solution and
dynamic informatics tools that facilitate pediatric cancer research. The COG Biobank also plans to
support the processing, banking, and distribution of biospecimens to the Cancer Immune Monitoring and
Analysis Centers (CIMACs)."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as a significant unmet medical need in
cardiovascular medicine and 60% of all new heart failure diagnoses are HFpEF. The increasing prevalence of
HFpEF coupled with a complete lack of effective FDA approved treatments further accentuates this critical public
health problem. It is well appreciated that chronic over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system promotes
left ventricular (LV) hypertrophic remodeling and fibrosis, profound endothelial and vascular injury, and renal
dysfunction.
The proposed studies will evaluate the beneficial effects of renal denervation (RDN) on left ventricular and
vascular function in a novel swine model of HFpEF. HFpEF will be induced in Göttingen miniswine following
chronic treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) combined with a Western Diet that induces
hypertension and metabolic syndrome followed by LV diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary congestion, exercise
intolerance, and clinically relevant HFpEF. RDN will be performed following the onset of HFpEF utilizing a clinical
RDN catheter system that employs ultrasound energy to destroy the renal sympathetic nerves.
The Central Hypothesis of the proposed studies is that RDN therapy will promote myocardial repair and attenuate
HFpEF progression via downregulation of pathological signaling in the kidney and heart.
Specific Aim 1 is to determine the effects of RDN therapy on heart failure progression and severity in a
clinically relevant large animal model of HFpEF.
Specific Aim 2 is to identify candidate cardiac and extra-cardiac mediators that underlie the
cardioprotective effects of RDN using genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic approaches.
These studies will determine if RDN ameliorates the severity and progression of HFpEF and explore the
mechanisms by which RDN exerts cardioprotective and vascular protective effects. These studies will involve an
array of physiological, biochemical, genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic approaches to assess the potential
efficacy of RDN in HFpEF. Results from these studies will significantly extend our current understanding of the
pathobiology of HFpEF and provide critical information that helps to guide the development of novel therapies to
treat patients that suffer from HFpEF."

 Psychedelics are compounds that produce an atypical state of consciousness characterized by altered
perception, cognition, and mood. Among psychedelics, psilocybin has gained attention recently because early
clinical trials indicated potential antidepressant effects, leading to a ‘breakthrough therapy’ designation from the
FDA to test psilocybin for major depressive disorder. However, despite the promise, the biological mechanisms
underpinning psilocybin’s potential therapeutic action are poorly understood. Our lab employs subcellular-
resolution two-photon microscopy to visualize dendritic structure and function in head-fixed mice. The goal of
this project is to characterize how a single dose of psilocybin may alter dendritic architecture in the medial
frontal cortex of the mouse and the associated cellular mechanisms. The hypothesis is that psilocybin
promotes spine formation by activating specific serotonin receptor subtypes and exerts differential effects on
distinct subtypes of pyramidal neurons. To test the hypothesis, we propose a series of experiments that
combine subcellular-resolution optical imaging, conditional knockouts, and causal perturbations in mice. The
results will answer crucial questions regarding psilocybin’s ability to promote structural plasticity in vivo and
delineate receptors and cellular factors that underlie the plasticity-promoting actions. We expect the
mechanistic insights will be important as the field evaluates psychedelics as a potential treatment option for
neuropsychiatric disorders and searches for novel antidepressants."
10852014,"In the stomach, metaplasia arises in the setting of parietal cell loss or oxyntic atrophy. Two types of
metaplasia occur in the human stomach: intestinal metaplasia (the presence of intestinal goblet cell lineages in
the stomach) and Spasmolytic Polypeptide-Expressing Metaplasia or SPEM (the presence of deep antral gland
type mucus cells in the corpus of the stomach). Investigations over the past decade have led to the
recognition that SPEM lineages are substantially derived from transdifferentiation of protein secreting chief
cells into mucus-secreting SPEM lineages. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that SPEM represents a
physiological local repair lineage that is meant to promote local restitution and then be replaced by normal
lineages. Importantly, the induction of SPEM from chief cells is orchestrated by release of IL-13 from ILC2
intrinsic mucosal immune cells. Elimination of ILC2s blocks the development of SPEM following acute parietal
cell loss. In the setting of chronic injury and inflammation, in addition to alterations in the inflammatory cells
within the metaplastic milieu, there is a resculpting of the stromal fibroblasts that likely supports the altered
metaplastic stem cell niche. We have identified the relocalization of telocyte fibroblast populations to the bases
of metaplastic glands following acute oxyntic atrophy in mice. In addition, we have identified four distinct
populations of fibroblast in the normal and diseased human stomach. Together these findings suggest that
intrinsic mucosal inflammatory cells and fibroblasts within the parenchyma of the metaplastic niche may
promote the maintenance of metaplastic cell lineages as well as their progression to more proliferative and
intestinalized pre-neoplastic lineages. We have hypothesized that intrinsic immune cell populations and altered
fibroblasts promote a remodeled tissue milieu that promotes progression towards neoplasia in the stomach.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we will examine two specific aims: First, we will determine how expansion of
ILC2s promotes metaplasia and its progression. Specifically, we will examine the effects of IL-13 and or ILC2-
co-culture with metaplastic gastroids to promote progression of metaplasia. Additionally, we will define the
transcriptional regulation initiated by IL-13 mediated activation of STAT6 that accounts for induction of
metaplasia progression. Second, we will define specific fibroblast populations that promote the development of
an altered pre-neoplastic milieu in the gastric mucosa. We will assess the dynamics of telocyte populations in
the establishment of the metaplastic milieu in mice and evaluate their ability to promote metaplastic
progression in vitro in co-culture. We will further isolate fibroblast sub-populations from regions of normal,
metaplastic, and cancerous human gastric mucosa to define alterations in fibroblast sub-populations that may
promote a pre-neoplastic niche in the metaplastic mucosa. These studies will establish in greater detail how
immune cell and fibroblast populations contribute to the development of a pre-cancerous milieu in the stomach
and will allow the identification of strategies that can arrest or reverse progression from metaplasia to cancer."
10852017,"Project Summary / Abstract
The switch from proliferation to differentiation is a key regulatory point in the adult stem cell lineages that
underlie tissue maintenance and repair, and failure to cleanly switch may contribute to genesis of cancer. My
laboratory has long used the Drosophila male germ line as a model to investigate how self-renewal,
proliferation and differentiation are regulated in adult stem cell lineages. Several lines of our inquiry have
recently converged on the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmentally programmed transition from
mitotic proliferation to onset of meiosis and differentiation, implicating a number of molecular and cellular
mechanisms in regulating this critical switch. We find that RNA binding proteins involved in translational control
and alternative splicing act cell autonomously to regulate the cessation of proliferation and that progression of
differentiation requires communication from associated somatic support cells. We discovered that a
developmentally regulated alternate choice of site at which certain nascent transcripts are cut to form 3' ends,
leading to production of novel mRNA isoforms with shortened 3'UTRs, controls dramatic changes in the suite
of proteins expressed in differentiating spermatocytes compared to proliferating spermatogonia. We found that
dramatic changes in chromatin open over 2000 new promoters with novel core sequence structure to turn on
the new cell type specific transcription program when cells initiate spermatocyte differentiation. Some of the
earliest genes turned on in this differentiation program encode chromatin associated proteins that prevent
spurious opening of normally cryptic promoters, thus preventing massive misexpression of genes associated
with the wrong cell type. Other transcripts upregulated with differentiation onset encode cell type-specific
translational regulators that delay production of core G2/M cell cycle machinery to program the extended G2
phase of meiotic prophase. Over the next 5 years, we propose to map how these processes collaborate to
form the regulatory circuitry that initiates then executes the switch from proliferation to differentiation. We will
investigate how the RNA binding proteins Bam and Bgcn trigger the switch from mitosis to meiosis by
repressing expression of the alternative splice factor HOW, identify candidate substrates of HOW by
immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-Seq, and assess their function in vivo, including whether they
communicate with adjacent somatic support cells. We will investigate how the switch in proteins expressed
due to alternative 3' end cut site selection on nascent transcripts is regulated and influences differentiation.
We will investigate how the differentiation program is kept off in precursor cells and how cell-type specific
chromatin regulators and proteins that recruit them to target loci set up the new transcription program for
differentiation. To elucidate how the developmental program remodels the cell cycle, we will investigate how
cell-type specific RNA binding proteins first repress, then activate translation of cyclin B during meiotic
prophase and how the DAZ homolog Boule regulates progression into the meiotic divisions.

10851651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deformability and non-adherence are the most intrinsic biorheological properties of red blood cells (RBCs), as
they play a critical role in modulating RBC perfusion through the microvasculature. In acquired or inherited
blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), these two interrelated properties are pathologically altered.
SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in its afflicted
populations. In SCD, RBCs undergo radical morphological and structural transformations leading to decreased
deformability and increased adhesiveness, which further trigger vascular complications and a number of
comorbidities including painful crises, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and organ failure. OcclusionChip is a
novel standardized in vitro microfluidic assay to measure microvascular occlusion mediated by RBCs in a wide
range of clinical conditions. The unique design embodies the two key features of the capillary bed: a gradient
of microcapillary networks and side passageways mimicking the arteriovenous anastomoses. Occlusion Index,
measured by the OcclusionChip assay, may serve as a new standard parameter to evaluate the clinical
efficacy of treatments improving red blood cell adhesion and deformability, such as hemoglobin modifying
drugs, anti-sickling agents, and emerging genetic therapies. The objective of this STTR Phase I/II Fast-Track
project is to translate and commercialize novel OcclusionChip microfluidic technology as a standardized and
validated companion diagnostic assay for SCD. In Phase I, we propose to streamline the manufacturing
process with a third-party manufacturer and establish a quality control strategy. In Phase II, we propose to
contract manufacture a large number of devices (1000), establish analytical validation and clinical validation
relative to conventional, targeted, or curative therapies in SCD. Our goal is to establish the manufacturability,
analytical validation, and clinical utility of the OcclusionChip in providing comprehensive functional
characterization of red cell biorheological properties and assessment of patient-specific response to emerging
targeted and curative therapies in SCD.

10851688,"Project Summary
Our chromosomes are continually bombarded with a variety of insults, resulting in damage that must be
repaired. By necessity, cells have evolved mechanisms to detect and repair broken strands of DNA,
thereby preventing loss of important genetic information. Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are a type
of damage that led to particularly disastrous outcomes. If not corrected, DSBs can lead to gross
chromosomal rearrangements, which are the hallmark of all forms of cancer. Indeed, defects in HR-
related proteins are associated with several severe genetic diseases. Patients with these diseases often
exhibit a strong predisposition for developing cancers due to a loss of genome integrity. Surprisingly,
DNA replication is the primary source of DSBs, and as a consequence rapidly growing cells are especially
dependent upon homologous DNA recombination for survival. This dependence upon homologous
recombination for the survival of rapidly growing cells highlights the potential for using recombination
inhibitors as highly selective cancer therapies. To fully exploit the clinical potential of homologous
recombination inhibitors it will be essential that we more fully understand the detail molecular
underpinnings of recombination and the proteins that are involved in regulating and controlling this
process.
 To help better understand the molecular basis of homologous DNA recombination we have developed
powerful new experimental platforms that allow us to directly visualize hundreds of individual DNA
molecules at the single molecule level. We are utilizing these unique research tools to probe the
fundamental basis for protein-nucleic acid interactions, with emphasis placed upon understanding
reactions relevant to human biology and disease. Here we will assess how ATP-dependent helicases can
exert “antirecombinase” activities and regulate homologous recombination by dismantling key
recombination intermediates. We will accomplish this goal by directly visualizing these processes in real-
time using optical microscopy. We will analyze factors that influence antirecombinase function and
specificity, we will determine precisely how antirecombinases dismantle recombination intermediates,
and we will seek to establish an understanding of common themes conserved among different eukaryotic
antirecombinases, as well as define the unique attributes of those proteins that are of particular importance
to human health. We will seek to determine detailed molecular information related to these questions, and
part of the significance of this project lies in the depth of the answers we strive to obtain."
10851689,"Voltage-gated sodium (Nav1.5) channels initiate action potentials and voltage-gated calcium (Cav1.2) channels
initiate excitation/contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes. They are molecular targets for mutations that cause
arrhythmias and for antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) used in control and prevention of life-threatening arrhythmias.
We have determined the structures of the bacterial Nav channel NavAb and the model calcium channel CavAb
by X-ray crystallography, and we have determined the structure of the primary cardiac Nav channel Nav1.5 at
high resolution by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This work gave new insight into the structure of the
ion selectivity filter and mechanism of Na and Ca selectivity, the structure of the voltage sensors and mechanisms
of voltage-dependent gating, the activation and inactivation gates and their functional interaction, the receptor
sites for AADs, and the mechanism of access of AADs to their receptor site through the open activation gate and
fenestrations in the sides of the pore. Mutations in Nav1.5 that cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias, including
Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Long QT Syndrome, map onto the pore module, voltage sensor, activation gate,
and fast inactivation gate of Nav and Cav channels, opening the way to probing the pathophysiology of these
mutations at the structural level. Here we will investigate the structural basis for Nav and Cav channel function,
the complex pore-blocking mechanisms of AADs, and the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological effects
of arrhythmia mutations. Aim 1. We will determine the structure of Nav1.5 channels in resting, open, and
inactivated states and analyze the molecular mechanisms for ion selectivity and conductance in the open state
of Nav1.5. Aim 2. We will prepare complexes of Nav1.5 in the closed, open, and inactivated states with AADs
bound, and we will resolve their structures at high resolution. We will probe structural differences in the drug-
receptor complexes formed by Class IA, IB, and IC AADs in order to understand the structural basis for the
differences in drug action that lead to their different clinical uses. We will examine the role of the fenestrations in
resting-state block by Class IA, IB, and IC AADs. Aim 3. We will insert mutations that cause Dilated
Cardiomyopathy and Long QT Syndrome Type-3 into NavAb and Nav1.5, characterize their pathophysiological
effects on Na currents and gating pore currents, and resolve their structures at high resolution by X-ray
crystallography and/or cryo-EM. Aim 4. We will insert mutations that cause Timothy Syndrome into CavAb and
Cav1.2, determine their pathophysiological effects on Ca and Ba currents, and resolve their structures at high
resolution by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Overall, these studies open the exciting possibility of
understanding cardiac Nav and Cav channels in atomic detail in native and pathogenic conformations and
learning how to manipulate the structures of AADs to make them more specific, more effective, and safer."

10862499,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY - Core C (Microneedle Patch Vaccines)
The threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases highlights the need for continued improvement of
vaccination strategies to enable more effective, sustainable, and equitable global immunization campaigns. As
a complementary strategy to the proposed work in the Research Projects (RPs) of this Center, the goal of Core
C is to develop, characterize, and validate highly innovative, plug-and-play polyphosphazene (PPZ) adjuvanted
dissolvable microneedle patch (MNP) platforms with RP-specific viral antigens to support the proposed research
in the RPs of the Center. Development of efficacious, patient-friendly, broadly deployable, and rapidly adaptable
PPZ MNP vaccination platforms and validation of their product attributes and immunological properties with the
RP-specific antigens against prototype viruses will be of great significance to maximize pandemic preparedness
against existing and novel human pathogenic viruses. The Core C of the Center will work seamlessly with Core
D and RPs of the Center to bring together the transformative project components, 1) cutaneous immunization,
2) Polyphosphazene (PPZ) adjuvant, and 3) dissolvable MNPs, with the rationally designed antigens that will be
developed in RPs against high-priority pathogens to enable the achievement of the overall goals of the Center,
as well as to support the translational development of a next-generation immunization strategy. The RP-specific
recombinant viral glycoprotein antigens will drive the generation of virus-specific protective immune responses.
The PPZ macromolecules will serve as an immunoadjuvant nanoassembly that will provide many immune-
potentiating features to complement subunit antigens, such as improved antigen uptake, multivalent antigen
presentation, and innate immune stimulation, to rationally augment vaccine-induced immunity. Dissolvable MNPs
will enable targeting vaccine components to the highly immunoresponsive skin layers in a reproducible and self-
administered manner for efficacious immunization, as well as facilitate the improved vaccine storage, distribution,
and coverage due to their thermostability and cost-effectiveness. Together, PPZ MNP vaccines will effectively
and safely harness the highly immunoresponsive cutaneous microenvironments to elicit robust, strong, and long-
lasting protective immunity against the target pathogen. The Core C will develop and batch release PPZ MNP
vaccine platforms with RP-specific antigens based on well-defined quantitative release criteria of their validated
physicochemical and immunological properties to enable the development of clinically feasible, highly protective
vaccines against several prototype pathogens from multiple viral families in the RPs. Ultimately, these clinically
translatable PPZ MNP vaccine platforms are readily adaptable to develop efficacious and broadly deployable

10862500,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY – Core D (Early and IND-Enabling Translational Research for Vaccines
and mAbs)
Core D will leverage the relationship between vaccines and antibodies to optimize the translational activities
performed by the PABVAX Center. Vaccines and antibodies are inextricably linked:
 1. mAbs can help define protective epitopes for a vaccine
 2. mAbs can help establish correlates of protection for vaccines
 3. Vaccine antigens can be used to discover mAbs
 4. mAbs can provide an alternative to a vaccine in immunocompromised populations and in emergency
 situations where immediate protection is required (i.e. there isn’t sufficient time to allow natural host
 immunity to develop from vaccination)
Developing mAb countermeasures and vaccines simultaneously will allow us to take advantage of natural
synergies between the two types of interventions and more efficiently advance superior prototypes.
To meet the goals of the PABVAX Center, Core D has the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Manufacture vaccine antigens and mAbs in support of the RPs and Cores
Manufacturing will be performed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical and Genovac to support the efforts of the other
Scientific Cores and the Research Projects. The largest scale manufacturing runs will be sufficient to support
stability testing and NHP dosing. This will also include production of a mAb prototype for an intramuscular (IM)
long-acting alternative to a vaccine to be evaluated in Core E (Animal Models).
Aim 2: Stability, manufacturability testing, and early process development of subunit vaccines.
Small scale manufacturing, stability testing and early-stage process development will be performed. As vaccines
are regulated by CBER, all activities will be performed consistent with regulatory expectations for this branch of
the FDA. Input from the Core’s vaccine industrial partners (Emergent Biosolutions and Moderna) will be
integrated into the translational development efforts.
Aim 3: Identification of correlates of protection, lead optimization, stability and manufacturability testing of mAbs.
Together with Dr. Gunn, engineered mAbs (altered N-glycans, Fc mutations for effector functions and extended
half-life, multimeric formats and nanobodies from RP5) will be evaluated to correlate mechanisms of action with
maximal efficacy. This work, in conjunction with stability and manufacturability assessment, will identify a lead
prototype format to transition to early process development. The goal will be to identify a single prototype for
long-term intramuscular prophylaxis as well as for intravenous post-exposure prophylaxis and therapy. As mAbs
are regulated by CDER, performance of all activities will be as per regulatory expectations."
10862501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Core E (Animal Model Development and Preclinical Evaluation)
Among viruses that cause disease in humans, viral zoonoses within the family Paramyxoviridae and order
Bunyavirales contain pathogens that cause significant lethality. Importantly, the Arenaviridae and Nairoviridae
families contain viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. These viruses include the
arenaviruses Lassa, Machupo, Lujo, and Chapare, and the nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
All of these viruses are also included among the World Health Organization’s (WHO) List of Priority Pathogens.
Within the Paramyxovirdae, the zoonotic henipaviruses Hendra virus and Nipah virus (NiV) are also on the WHO
Priority Pathogens list. Notably, these henipaviruses stand out for their impressive lethality with case fatality
rates averaging about 75%. Significantly, there is evidence of multiple rounds of person-to-person transmission
of NiV. All of these RNA viruses pose threats to global public health due to the absence of approved vaccines or
therapeutics. There is a clear unmet need for countermeasures to address the threat of natural outbreaks,
epidemics, or deliberate release. The Paramyxoviridae and Bunyavirales Vaccines and Antibodies Center
(PABVAX) is a well-integrated consortium conducting a set of discovery and translational research programs
composed of a Data Management Core, three Scientific Cores, and five Research Projects (RPs). The
synergistic activities of PABVAX partners will be focused on developing novel vaccines, treatments, and tools to
foster pandemic preparedness. Federal law requires that the arenaviruses, nairoviruses, and henipaviruses used
in the PABVAX Center be handled in an approved Biosafety Level (BSL)-4 containment laboratory. Core E
provides an approved BSL-4 facility and a trained and highly experienced team of BSL-4 investigators and staff
to perform studies that support RP1, RP2, RP4, RP5, Core C, and Core D. Core E will perform well-documented
animal efficacy studies based on a quality system approach that will be supported by Core A with all data
generated managed by Core B. The services provided by Core E will include 1) a secure repository of well
characterized seed stocks of BSL-4 arenaviruses, nairoviruses, and henipaviruses 2) in vitro antiviral activity
assays; 3) procurement of UTMB IACUC approval of animal protocols; 4) procurement, housing, and husbandry
of animals; 5); development and/or optimization of animal models for strains or variants of henipaviruses,
arenaviruses, and nairoviruses to fill gaps as needed; 6) generation of tools including immune reagents and
inactivated samples from animals for distribution to RPs, Cores, and other ReVAMPP Centers; 7) virus challenge,
vaccination, treatment, and collection of samples from animals; 8) technical expertise and equipment to conduct
clinical pathological, immunological, and virological analysis of samples and to perform necropsies in BSL-4
containment; 9) histopathological analysis of tissues collected from animals infected with BSL-4 viruses; and 10)
quality systems management of all records and data generated from animal studies."
10862502,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RP1 (Antigen Design and Testing Of Arenavirus And Nairovirus
Vaccines)
The viral order Bunyavirales contains several high priority human pathogens. Notably, Arenaviridae and
Nairoviridae families contain viruses which cause severe hemorrhagic diseases in humans across the world
with mortality rates up to 60% and some are associated with significant, long-term sequelae in survivors. Of
these, rodent borne arenaviruses – Lassa (LASV), Lujo, Chapare, Guanarito, Junin and Machupo viruses and
one tickborne Nairovirus-Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus- are identified as NIAID Category A
pathogens due to ease of dissemination or transmission person-to-person, production of significant morbidity
and mortality, the potential for major public health impact, and due to the requirement for special action for public
health preparedness. Threats to public health are further heightened by the lack of internationally approved
vaccines to address threats of natural epidemics as well as the potential bio-weaponization of these viruses. To
address this unmet need, PABVAX RP1 will leverage combined expertise in high-containment virology,
immunology, and biological product development, to develop arenavirus and nairovirus research tools and
vaccine approaches using prototype members of each viral group which can be adapted across each viral family
using a “plug-and-play” approach. Much of the work developing vaccines for these viruses has relied on
isolates derived over 40 years ago, recent advances in viral reverse for these viral families is making vaccine
testing of emerging isolates more feasible by improving access. Vaccine development for most arenaviruses and
nairoviruses has centered on the understanding of the critical role for viral glycoproteins (GP) and nucleoproteins
(NP) to drive natural immunity. We have recently successfully engineered a recombinant, stabilized prefusion
LASV GPe to act as an antigenic mimic of viral surface displayed GP and found this trimeric GPe alone, co-
delivered with NP, or NP subunits alone, can protect guinea pigs against lethal challenge by LASV underscoring
the value of these antigens as vaccine components. Subunit vaccines are prime candidates for alternative
vaccination approaches like microneedle patches (MNP). MNP coupled antigens and adjuvants directly interact
with the potently immunoresponsive cutaneous microenvironments using dissolvable MNPs to elicit robust and
long-lasting protective immunity against the target pathogen. The importance of humoral immunity for affording
potent protection or treatment against viral infections cannot be understated as evidenced by the recent success
using monoclonal antibody therapies to treat Ebola virus disease or COVID-19, yet little is known for the potential
for pre-exposure prophylactic (PREP) administration of antibody therapies and what kind of prophylactic windows
are possible. In this proposal, we will develop protective protein-based subunit-MNP vaccines, PREP treatment
strategies, and recombinant virus tools using prototyped arenaviruses and nairoviruses which will template
development of countermeasures against other related Bunyaviridae members."

Despite the number of people affected each year by persistent pain and poorly healed fractures after nonfatal
traumatic and surgical injury it remains unclear what are the key components of the profound multicellular
response to injury and how they can be manipulated to improve outcomes. In particular, peripheral injury
mobilizes the immune system to resolve tissue damage, however, sustained immune activation can be
detrimental and contribute to delayed healing. Myeloid-lineage cells are instrumental in the innate immune
response to injury- peripherally, as macrophages, and centrally, as yolk sac-derived microglia. Nevertheless, the
temporal and compartment-specific contributions of myeloid-lineage cells to bone healing, perioperative pain
and surgical recovery have yet to be elucidated. Precise manipulation of these myeloid-lineage cells to establish
causation is not possible in humans. To identify cellular and molecular targets for improving recovery we will
therefore take advantage of a clinically informed mouse model of orthopaedic injury. Our central hypothesis is
that there is a critical period during which myeloid-lineage cell involvement is crucial for proper recovery from
injury; however, prolonged activation, marked by cytokine release and loss of homeostatic functions, can
contribute to pain and impaired bone healing ultimately increasing the risk for long-term disability. To pursue this
fundamental work, we will use a combination of molecular and whole organism approaches in which we have
significant expertise including mouse models of complex orthopaedic trauma, affective-motivational readouts of
persistent pain and functional impairment, specific transgenic manipulations and longitudinal imaging of bone
and CNS tissues. In particular, this convergence of capabilities uniquely positions us to answer the following key
knowledge gaps: 1) The innate immune response is instrumental to recovery, but can its dysfunction be
monitored in vivo to identify at risk individuals? 2) What specific molecular signatures of activated myeloid-
lineage cells can be targeted peripherally and centrally to improve outcomes? 3) Is the myeloid-lineage response
to peripheral injury evolutionarily conserved and therefore translationally relevant? The proposed research builds
on our previous work in a mouse model of chronic pain in which we showed that: 1) Myeloid-targeted positron
emission tomography ligands can track dysfunctional innate immune activation, 2) Attenuation of macrophage
and microglial activation can improve persistent pain, 3) New markers can be used to distinguish infiltrating
macrophages from resident microglia in the spinal cord thus clarifying their unique contributions. Ultimately,
these studies will establish how myeloid-lineage cells may be the initial cellular link between peripheral injury,
poor bone healing and severe acute pain. Successful completion of the proposed studies will enhance our
understanding of compartment-specific macrophage and microglia effects on healing after injury, identify cell-
specific targets for intervention, and clarify when and in whom such treatments will provide the most benefit."
10831023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an established treatment for patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile
infection (CDI). Although most patients with CDI can be successfully treated, the subset of acutely ill patients with severe
and fulminant CDI is a much greater challenge, with high rates of colectomy and mortality. Furthermore, a variety of
safety concerns remain for FMT. The risk of transmission of harmful microbes is highlighted by recent reports of
transmission of multi-drug resistant organisms and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). In addition, although most work has
focused on bacteria, FMT also transfers non-bacterial microorganisms, and the clinical impact of these microbes may be
important in fully understanding the clinical implications of FMT. Because the gut microbiota also plays a role in the
pathogenesis of chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer, heart disease), FMT has the potential to cause
chronic conditions that might take years to manifest clinically. Finally, the field is rapidly evolving with the development
of commercial products formulated with live microorganisms, known as live biotherapeutic products (LBPs). Thus,
critically important questions regarding the real-world safety and effectiveness of FMT and LBPs remain unanswered.
 The FMT National Registry is a uniquely suited resource to study these key issues. The Registry includes 32 North
American sites (and 19 additional centers pending) with an established infrastructure to collect clinical data on FMT
donors and recipients and a separate portal to collect information from FMT recipients. The Registry’s link to an
independent biobank also provides a rich source for studying manipulation of the gut microbiota in humans.
 Our first specific aim is to expand knowledge on the long-term safety and effectiveness of FMT by A) continuing
systematic collection of clinical metadata up to 10 years post-FMT to better define safety, including risk of developing
chronic medical conditions, with incidence rates for predefined chronic conditions in Registry participants compared
with a control group of patients from a national database with multiply recurrent CDI not treated with FMT; B)
determining real-world estimates of effectiveness of FMT and LBPs to treat hospitalized patients with severe/fulminant
CDI and identify factors associated with cure; and C) expanding the registry to include new LBPs, assessing effectiveness
for CDI as compared to FMT in real-world populations and examining off-label use of LBPs for indications beyond CDI.
The second specific aim is to characterize the potential value of shotgun metagenomics sequencing (SMS) and data
analytics as a platform technology to identify and characterize potentially harmful microbes transmitted by FMT or LBPs
by first determining the sensitivity and specificity of SMS to identify and characterize bacterial pathogens using the
emerging pathogen, atypical EPEC (aEPEC) as a prototype. Genotype-phenotype analyses will be performed using a
combination of in vitro bioassays and whole genome sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity of SMS to identify these
strains and their virulence genes will then be determined by fecal spiking experiments. Additionally, studies will be
performed to characterize the impact of FMT/LBP therapy on the resistome and transmission of non-bacterial microbes
(virome, mycobiome) with SMS in patients treated for severe/fulminant CDI."
10831025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite intense research, we lack even the most basic understanding of how structural and functional changes
in small vessel diseases of the brain (SVD) are linked to tissue oxygenation, whether this results in tissue
hypoxia (O2 supply-demand mismatch), and how different microvascular segments contribute to this mismatch
in different brain areas. Leveraging our cutting-edge optical imaging tools for absolute pO2, blood flow, Ca2+
signaling, and microvascular morphology, and a clinically relevant CADASIL mouse model, we propose to
examine for the first time a causal link between microvascular dysfunction and O2 supply-demand mismatch.
CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is
the most common monogenic inherited form of SVD leading to dementia, caused by mutations in Notch3.
Transgenic models of CADASIL recapitulate many clinical and histopathological hallmarks of the disease,
including early signs of SVD such as impaired CBF and functional hyperemic responses, and functional and
structural abnormalities in both arterioles and capillaries.
We will quantify absolute intravascular and tissue pO2, metabolic rate of O2 (CMRO2), CBF and capillary red
blood cell flux, and microvascular morphology, at rest and during functional brain activation, in both gray and
white matter, longitudinally over months, in unanesthetized CADASIL transgenic mice. Aim 1 will test whether
CADASIL causes age-dependent O2 supply-demand mismatch, manifested in islets of tissue hypoxia at rest or
during functional activation. Combining two-photon microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT), we
will test whether CADASIL leads to abnormal capillary red blood cell flux and increased capillary transit time
heterogeneity causing O2 supply-demand mismatch even before a reduction in absolute CBF becomes
manifest. Finally, we will examine whether O2 supply-demand mismatch can be corrected by genetic,
pharmacological, and immunological manipulations. Aim 2 will test whether CADASIL causes Ca2+
dysregulation in vascular smooth muscle and pericytes and whether it can be corrected by genetic,
pharmacological and immunological manipulations. Aim 3 will integrate the measurements from Aims 1 and 2
and construct a numerical model of oxygen advection and diffusion based on measured microvascular
morphology, reactivity, perfusion, and oxygenation. The model will relate structural and functional
microvascular changes to tissue O2 supply-demand mismatch, quantify the contribution and predict the limits of
the arteriolar and capillary compartments to support tissue oxygenation below which O2 supply-demand
mismatch develops. The model will thus shed light on all other SVDs (e.g. hypertension, amyloid). Altogether,
this proposal aims to fill significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction
in CADASIL, and will inform the vascular mechanisms of progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive
impairment in more common forms of SVD as well as in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

Many industrial chemicals, environmental pollutants and other xenochemicals activate transcription factors
belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which leads to widespread genomic, epigenetic and
transcriptional changes that disrupt key biological pathways and metabolic processes in liver and other
tissues. The studies proposed focus on the liver nuclear receptor CAR (Constitutive Androstane Receptor;
NR1I3), which is activated by structurally diverse xenochemicals and regulates transcription of hundreds of
protein-coding genes important for processes such as xenobiotic metabolism, lipogenesis, glucose
homeostasis, and inflammation, and has been implicated as a regulator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) development. We have discovered that xenobiotic agonists of CAR and other xenobiotic-responsive
receptors induce or repress the transcription of several hundred nuclear-enriched long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) with epigenetic and gene regulatory potential, many of which have human orthologs. This proposal
builds on these findings and on recent advances in liver cell zonation, single cell-based transcriptomic
profiling, and gene co-expression network analysis to elucidate in an intact mouse liver model the effects of
CAR-responsive lncRNAs on fatty liver disease induced by foreign chemical exposure. The studies proposed
test the hypothesis that a subset of CAR-responsive lncRNAs control hepatic gene regulatory networks driving
NAFLD and downstream pathologies, dysregulating processes such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism,
hepatic architecture and mitochondrial function in a liver cell type-specific and hepatic lobule zone-dependent
manner. The work proposed uses TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloro-pyridyloxy)]benzene), a prototypic non-
genotoxic chemical and CAR-specific agonist ligand, to address the seemingly paradoxical finding that
persistent exposure to foreign chemical CAR activators induces NAFLD in mice fed normal chow diet, but
suppresses NAFLD development in mice fed a high fat diet. These studies will elucidate the role of CAR, and
the lncRNAs that it regulates, in fatty liver disease etiology and progression. Results obtained will give critical
insight into the underlying mechanisms by which foreign chemicals dysregulate CAR-dependent metabolic
pathways linked to NAFLD, which affects 25% of US adults and is a major cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular
cancer and liver failure. This work will refocus research efforts on xenochemical action to include mechanistic
studies of single cell-based, spatially zonated gene regulatory networks and the non-coding transcriptome,

11066607,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Many industrial chemicals, environmental pollutants and other xenochemicals activate transcription factors
belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which leads to widespread genomic, epigenetic and
transcriptional changes that disrupt key biological pathways and metabolic processes in liver and other
tissues. The studies proposed focus on the liver nuclear receptor CAR (Constitutive Androstane Receptor;
NR1I3), which is activated by structurally diverse xenochemicals and regulates transcription of hundreds of
protein-coding genes important for processes such as xenobiotic metabolism, lipogenesis, glucose
homeostasis, and inflammation, and has been implicated as a regulator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) development. We have discovered that xenobiotic agonists of CAR and other xenobiotic-responsive
receptors induce or repress the transcription of several hundred nuclear-enriched long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) with epigenetic and gene regulatory potential, many of which have human orthologs. This proposal
builds on these findings and on recent advances in liver cell zonation, single cell-based transcriptomic
profiling, and gene co-expression network analysis to elucidate in an intact mouse liver model the effects of
CAR-responsive lncRNAs on fatty liver disease induced by foreign chemical exposure. The studies proposed
test the hypothesis that a subset of CAR-responsive lncRNAs control hepatic gene regulatory networks driving
NAFLD and downstream pathologies, dysregulating processes such as lipid and carbohydrate metabolism,
hepatic architecture and mitochondrial function in a liver cell type-specific and hepatic lobule zone-dependent
manner. The work proposed uses TCPOBOP (1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloro-pyridyloxy)]benzene), a prototypic non-
genotoxic chemical and CAR-specific agonist ligand, to address the seemingly paradoxical finding that
persistent exposure to foreign chemical CAR activators induces NAFLD in mice fed normal chow diet, but
suppresses NAFLD development in mice fed a high fat diet. These studies will elucidate the role of CAR, and
the lncRNAs that it regulates, in fatty liver disease etiology and progression. Results obtained will give critical
insight into the underlying mechanisms by which foreign chemicals dysregulate CAR-dependent metabolic
pathways linked to NAFLD, which affects 25% of US adults and is a major cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular
cancer and liver failure. This work will refocus research efforts on xenochemical action to include mechanistic
studies of single cell-based, spatially zonated gene regulatory networks and the non-coding transcriptome,
and will serve as a paradigm for other foreign chemical-activated receptors that dysregulate gene expression
in complex ways. Together, the proposed studies on CAR-responsive lncRNAs and their role in xenochemical-
induced liver pathology may lead to new ways to prevent, diagnose or treat liver diseases induced by chemical
exposure."
10830951,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Pompe disease results from mutations in the gene for acid α-glucosidase (GAA) – an enzyme necessary to
degrade lysosomal glycogen. Early-onset disease occurs in the absence of functional GAA which leads to
cardiorespiratory failure early in life. Late-onset disease is associated with reduced GAA activity and gradual
progression to respiratory failure. Work from our first two grant cycles indicates neural involvement in
respiratory failure in Gaa-/- mice and Pompe patients. This is relevant since the standard of care – intravenous
enzyme therapy using recombinant GAA - does not reach the central nervous system (CNS) and patients still
progress to respiratory failure. Our overarching hypothesis is that adeno-associated virus (AAV) therapy is
capable of restoring life-long GAA expression throughout the CNS, skeletal and cardiac muscle, thereby
preserving cardiorespiratory function and prolonging life. Aim 1 focuses on AAV therapy for early-onset
disease which requires early life treatments that can prevent both respiratory and cardiac failure. To better
study this problem, we created a Gaa null (Gaa-/-) rat model which recapitulates the early onset phenotype with
cardiorespiratory pathology and early mortality. Preliminary data indicate that neonatal AAV-GAA therapy
(desmin promoter, AAV9 serotype) evokes no detectable immune response, mitigates cardiac and respiratory
pathology and prevents early death. Thus, we hypothesize that a single intravenous AAV-GAA dose in young
rats can drive persistent and widespread GAA expression and extend the Pompe rat lifespan. Aim 2
addresses late onset Pompe disease in which respiratory failure is the primary cause of mortality. Based on
data from our first two grant cycles we hypothesize that neural directed AAV-GAA therapy in adult Pompe rats
is sufficient to prevent respiratory decline and extend the lifespan. By packaging AAV-GAA with muscle
(creatine kinase 8), neural (synapsin) or tissue specific (muscle and neural, desmin) promoters, and delivering
the vector intrathecally, intravenously, or both, we can drive GAA expression in a manner that will determine if
neural correction is necessary and sufficient to prevent decline. The aforementioned Gaa null rat will be used
to test proof-of-concept for neural vs. muscle correction in the absence of endogenous GAA activity. We will
also use another new Pompe rat model in which CRISPR/cas9 has been used to insert the most common
human gene mutation causing late-onset Pompe disease (IVS1) into the rat genome. This is important
because the IVS1 mutation leads to low but not absent GAA activity and is associated with delayed
progression to respiratory failure. The proposed work is significant because current therapeutic strategies in
Pompe disease only delay disease progression with eventual respiratory failure. The strategies proposed here
will also contribute to the broader goal of advancing gene therapy for neurodegenerative conditions and
autosomal recessive diseases."

 Epidemiological data link history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to increased likelihood of development of
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other AD-related dementias (ADRD) later in life. While recent meta-analyses
estimate the overall risk of dementia attributable to TBI at 5-15%, it remains poorly understood how history of
brain trauma may contribute to neurodegeneration years or even decades later.
 One possibility is that TBI may accelerate detrimental cellular changes occurring during normal brain ageing.
A potential candidate is the autophagy-lysosomal pathway essential for degrading misfolded proteins and
damaged organelles. Autophagy function declines during brain aging and more severely in neurodegenerative
diseases. Thus, accelerated inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function as compared to that observed in normal
brain aging, could contribute to neurodegeneration observed in AD and other age-related dementias. We recently
demonstrated that autophagy is also inhibited after TBI. This is caused by TBI-induced lysosomal defects and is
associated with profound changes in lysosomal lipid composition. Lysosomal dysfunction associated with
accumulation of lipofuscin and other lipid byproducts in the endo-lysosomal compartments is also observed in
aged mice and is exacerbated by either drug or disease induced demyelinating episodes. Since TBI leads to
myelin damage as well as more general perturbation of lipid metabolism in the brain, lipid-mediated damage
could also lead to lysosomal inhibition after TBI and over time cause accelerated autophagy-lysosomal
dysfunction as compared to that observed during normal aging, thus contributing to AD/ADRD.
 We hypothesize that perturbation of lipid homeostasis after TBI accelerates lysosomal lipid accumulation as
compared to normal aging, leading to lysosomal dysfunction and autophagy defects, thus predisposing to
neurodegeneration and AD/ADRD. In order to test this hypothesis, we will use HILIC-MS/MS based lipidomic
analysis of brain lysosomes, MS-based lipid imaging and complementary IF/IHC and biochemical approaches
to compare changes in lysosomal lipid composition and autophagy-lysosomal function in the brains of normal
aging mice and mice aging after TBI. To test the causative effect of perturbed autophagy and lipid metabolism
on development of AD/ADRD relevant pathological and cognitive phenotypes we will use autophagy hypomorph
Becn1+/- mice and Scarb1+/- mice with hypercholesterolemia. We will also use a fly TBI model to identify additional
autophagy and lipid metabolism genes linking TBI to AD/ADRD. We expect that our data will demonstrate that
perturbation of lysosomal lipid metabolism and autophagy by TBI is an important contributor to subsequent
development of AD/ADRD."
10830955,"The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii causes life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed or
transplant patients. Its pathology mainly relies on the dissemination of the parasite from the site of infection to
various essential organs, such as the brain, where it causes tissue destruction. T. gondii often uses a Trojan
Horse mechanism to facilitate its dissemination, during which it hijacks the host cell migration machinery to co-
opt host leukocytes as shuttling vectors. Exactly how T. gondii does so, however, is largely unknown. We
recently identified a novel T. gondii protein important for its dissemination, which we named TgWIP. We found
that upon invasion the parasite secreted TgWIP into the host cell cytosol, where TgWIP stimulated dendritic
cells to become hyper-migratory and undergo a mesenchymal to amoeboid transition (MAT). The process was
associated with a dramatic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. The overall objective of this application is
to determine the molecular mechanisms by which TgWIP mediates T. gondii dissemination in the host. Our
central hypothesis is that TgWIP promotes dissemination by modulating leukocyte actin dynamics. This
hypothesis was formulated based on our preliminary data showing that TgWIP directly interacts with several
central regulators of the actin cytoskeleton involved in cell migration, including the WAVE regulatory complex
(WRC), the SH2-SH3 adaptor proteins Nck and Grb2, and the SHP1/2 tyrosine phosphatases. We will test our
hypothesis by pursuing two aims: 1) determine how TgWIP interacts with various actin regulators to modulate
host actin dynamics in vitro, and 2) determine how TgWIP enhances host leukocyte motility to facilitate
dissemination in vivo. Specifically, our team will combine biochemistry, cell biology, and animal models to
determine (i) how TgWIP directly interacts with the WRC, Nck, Grb2, and SHP1/2, and how the interactions
influence actin polymerization in vitro; (ii) how these interactions alter the migrative behaviors of primary
dendritic cells; and (iii) how disruption of these interactions influences in vivo dissemination of T. gondii in mice.
Our proposed research is innovative because it will unravel a novel mechanism by which TgWIP, as a newly
identified parasite effector unique to T. gondii, coordinates several distinct host actin regulators to reroute
leucocyte migration and facilitate T. gondii dissemination. Our work is significant because understanding the
molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying T. gondii dissemination will lay the foundation for the
development of novel interventions that can directly target these mechanisms and block T. gondii
dissemination after acute infection or reactivation in AIDS or transplant patients or from the mother to the fetus.
This knowledge will be also important for the development of a safe, non-transmissible live vaccine that can
prevent T. gondii transmission from animals. Furthermore, by understanding how TgWIP promotes MAT in
infected DCs, our work will provide valuable insights into how other cells, such as metastatic cancer cells and
leukocytes, may use a similar mechanism to undergo MAT in response to diverse environmental conditions."
10831047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-24-year-olds in the United States. A challenging
component of suicide prevention is the detection of high-risk young people. Prior research suggests that the
vast majority of suicide decedents deny suicidal ideation in their last conversation with a mental health
provider. It is thus unsurprising that only 15% of mental health professionals report feeling very confident
assessing youth suicide risk. Behavioral markers offer one avenue for more objective risk determination.
Despite progress in this area, behavioral markers have been operationalized primarily in the form of reaction
times and task performance, only scratching the surface of what is possible with the rich, dynamic nature of
behavioral data. Recent advances in computational science offer an opportunity to model behavioral
information that is not easily quantifiable or even perceivable to human beings. This study aims to employ
machine learning-based approaches to characterize non-verbal behaviors exhibited during suicide
assessments, and test whether these behaviors can be used to identify suicidal adolescents and young adults.
Specifically, we will automatically extract paralinguistic characteristics, spontaneous facial action, and head
motion exhibited by adolescents and young adults, and their clinical interviewers. We will use traditional
hypothesis testing to examine whether a set of non-verbal behaviors informed by previous research
differentiate suicidal (i.e., past year active suicidal ideation) and nonsuicidal (i.e., no lifetime history of suicidal
thoughts/behaviors) adolescents and young adults (Aim 1). We will then use machine learning to test whether
any additional, empirically-determined non-verbal behaviors may contribute to our ability to identify suicidal
participants (Aim 2). Data will be drawn from audio-recorded administrations of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and
Behaviors Interview-Revised with suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents and young adults (n=232; 12-19 yrs),
and video-recorded administrations of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale with suicidal and
nonsuicidal young adults (n=70; 18-24 yrs). With an eye toward prospective prediction of suicidal behavior in
future research, the long-term goal of this line of work is to harness computational methods to quantify non-
verbal behaviors that can be used to detect suicide risk objectively and at scale."

 Maintenance for State Manufactured Food Regulatory Programs
It is the intent of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Division
of Environmental Health and Sustainability (CDPHE-DEHS) to use this opportunity to
manage and maintain conformance with the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program
Standards (MFRPS) by implementing the policies, procedures and protocols used by our
Manufactured Foods Program staff when inspecting and regulating the manufactured
foods industry in Colorado. Our goal is to ensure that staff working within the program
is well trained, knowledgeable and will consistently and uniformly apply that
knowledge to the situations encountered while inspecting and providing technical
guidance, education and outreach to the regulated community. In 2020, CDPHE was
determined to be in full conformance and full implementation with the 2019 MFRPS
standards for its manufactured food regulatory inspection program. The requirement
for states to be in full conformance with the MFRPS as a condition of continued FDA
contractual work and the need to apply these same standards to the State program
requires the dedication of significant resources that are not currently available to
Colorado’s program. Maintaining a solid program foundation will continue to help
improve the program now and for the future.
The goal is to have the work conducted by Colorado’s program to continue to be
recognized for its quality and consistency related to inspections, laboratory analytical
findings, industry outreach and staff training based on the requirements of the 2022
MFRPS. This will allow the agency to meet its goal of ensuring manufactured foods in
Colorado and all manufactured food products that leave the state are safe. The
agency is committed to help achieve FDA’s goal of an integrated food safety system
and ensure that Colorado’s inspections, investigations, laboratory findings and
program products are recognized as equivalent to the work product of other states or
the FDA that are using the MFRPS as the foundation for their programs."

The predoctoral NIDA Training Program in Neuroscience was founded at the University of Michigan (UM) in
1995. This Training Program is administered by a Director and Co-Director, and aims to recruit, develop and
enhance student interest in research related to the neurobiology of substance abuse. To be eligible for support
by the NIDA Training Program students must first gain admittance to an existing UM graduate program in the
biological, biomedical and natural sciences, such as the interdepartmental Neuroscience Graduate Program,
the Biopsychology Program, or the Department of Pharmacology Graduate Program. Students nominated for
support by the NIDA Training Program in Neuroscience are selected on the basis of two criteria: 1) academic
qualifications and references (i.e. academic excellence) and, 2) the relevance of their program of study and
research interests to the NIDA mission. After selection for the NIDA Training Program in Neuroscience,
students pursue a program of study in the neurosciences, including a required course on the
neuropsychopharmacology of substance abuse and an accompanying seminar series involving the NIDA
Training Program faculty. In addition, current and past trainees attend regular journal clubs, seminar series and
networking events supported by this grant to foster a sense of community and maintain student interest in
substance abuse research throughout their dissertation work. There are 14 core faculty members for the NIDA
Training Program in Neuroscience, all of whom are currently funded by NIDA and conduct research related to
the neurobiological basis of substance abuse. The core Training Program faculty members have changed
since the prior funding cycle, with the removal of three faculty members who are phasing towards retirement,
and two who have left the University of Michigan. Four new core faculty members have been added. In
addition, 7 “Junior Faculty Affiliates” have been added; early Assistant Professors who will be seeking NIDA
funding. All faculty members have prior mentoring experience, and there is a plan in place for more senior
faculty to serve as co-mentors to enrich the mentoring experience for the trainees. Furthermore, the faculty
affiliated with this Training Program are assisted by over 150 Neuroscience Graduate Program Faculty who are
involved in many aspects of the training, as well as the Rackham Graduate School which offers a number of
programs to enhance mentor-mentee relationships and provide a supportive and productive environment for
trainees. Together, the long history of our Training Program, the Directorship, and the resources provided by
the University of Michigan and affiliated programs puts us in an excellent position to accomplish the major goal
of this training grant. That is, to provide the necessary infrastructure and support for trainees pursuing research
interests related to the neurobiology of substance abuse as they work towards their doctoral degree in
neuroscience or a related field."

arousal, and alcohol use disorder (AUD). I have benefitted from experimental training in numerous
techniques including two-photon microscopy, neurophysiology, circuit anatomy, and behavior. During
the mentored phase of this grant (K99), I will continue to work closely with my co-mentors, Drs.
Mriganka Sur and Elena Vazey. Mriganka is an expert in cortical information processing, neuron-
astrocyte circuits, and optical techniques. Elena Vazey is an expert in noradrenergic signaling, stress,
alcohol-related behaviors, and chemogenetics. In addition, I will receive advice from my mentoring team
consisting of Drs. Kerry Ressler, Heather Richardson, and Thomas Kash. Their combined expertise
ranges across stress pathophysiology, alcohol-related processing, limbic and reward circuits,
neuromodulation, and anxiety behaviors. The additional training from my mentoring team will equip me
with the conceptual and technical acumen to become a significant contributor to the fields of alcohol
behavior and stress. This training will be done within the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at
MIT, which provides both a vibrant intellectual research community and expansive research
infrastructure support. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I developed novel methods of simultaneously
imaging astrocyte-neuron networks to study astrocyte roles in information processing. This work led
me to study how astrocytes affect neuromodulation of cortical circuits by norepinephrine (NE). I have
found an intriguing astrocyte-neuron calcium signature that reflects a shift in cortical processing during
periods of high arousal. Furthermore, the drugs that are currently being tested in arousal disorders and
AUD block these signatures, suggesting that astrocyte-neuron interactions may provide crucial insight
into the pathophysiology of stress and AUD. My immediate goals are to understand how these events
relate to arousal and alcohol drinking behavior, and to determine the relationship with abnormal NE
release. (Aim 1) I will study the astrocyte-neuron processing in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) while mice
actively drink alcohol on using in vivo two-photon imaging. (Aim 2) I will determine the role of NE in
affecting astrocyte-neuron physiology through pharmacological and chemogenetic manipulations of NE
release. (Aim 3) Finally, during R00 phase, I will manipulate astrocyte-specific mechanisms to
determine the role of astrocytes in arousal-mediated alcohol consumption. These experiments will
clarify how astrocyte-neuron dysregulation in the PFC is related to NE release and AUD."

Tumors affecting the brain result in more cancer-related deaths than any other type of tumor in children. It is
therefore critical to identify new therapies for these deadly diseases. Among pediatric patients, one of the most
devastating brain tumor types is diffuse midline gliomas with the H3K27M mutation, which includes the
previously named Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Our understanding of this deadly disease has
recently been advanced by important discoveries, including the finding that almost all of DIPG tumors harbor
the histone H3K27M mutation. This mutation results in global hypomethylation of H3K27 residues and is the
pathological hallmark for this disease. How the H3K27M mutation is important for tumorigenesis is still being
elucidated. At Mayo Clinic, we have shown that H3K27M mutation reprograms gene expression and histone
methylation patterns, and is a key driver for these deadly tumors. We hypothesize this mutation creates unique
therapeutic vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to develop novel therapies. In an effort to discover potential
drug targets for H3K27M tumors, we performed a large scale drug screen which identified aurora kinase
inhibitors (AKI) as a potent class of drugs that decreased the proliferation and survival of H3K27M tumor cell
lines. Further testing revealed epigenetic changes with AKI treatment including restoring H3K27me3 levels,
and decreased H3S10 and H3S28 phosphorylation. Testing of the aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib in an
orthotopic patient derived xenografts showed decreased tumor size, increased survival and on-target drug
effects within the tumor.
Based on these exciting results, we hypothesize that inhibition of Aurora Kinase is a targeted approach for
treating tumors with the H3K27M mutation. In this proposal, we will elucidate how the H3K27M mutation effects
mitosis, the mechanism how AKIs modulate the cell cycle and arrest of mitosis and understand the
radiosensitizing effects of these drugs. Next we will understand the molecular mechanisms how aurora kinases
modulate the epigenetic landscape and gene expression before and after inhibition. Finally, we will perform the
necessary preclinical studies in animal models to support translational efforts in the clinic. We have assembled
the necessary team required to successfully complete this project: including Jann Sarkaria, a radiation
oncologist who specializes in translational animal research for high-grade gliomas, Ted Hinchcliffe, an expert in
mitosis from the Hormel/University of MN, Steven Johnsen, an expert who studies epigenetic regulation in
cancer, and the PI, David Daniels, a pediatric neurosurgeon and medicinal chemist, who has developed
numerous H3K27M cell lines and studies drug delivery to the brainstem. We believe, together, the proposed
studies and team, will not only make basic scientific discoveries aimed at understanding the molecular basis of
tumorigenesis, but also lay the foundation for effective therapy for this deadly disease."

Skeletal muscle accounts for 40% of body mass and defines in significant ways who we are as human beings.
From the essential underpinnings of breathing, to the basic day-to-day movements of sitting, standing, and
walking, skeletal muscle function enables the fullness of the human condition. Numerous skeletal muscle
diseases cause marked contractile dysfunction leading to significantly diminished overall wellbeing and lifespan
in humans. Therefore, preventing or reversing muscle dysfunction has significant health relevance. This proposal
focuses on the sarcomere - the functional unit of striated muscle – known to underlie multiple forms of contractile
dysfunction. In Nemaline myopathy, severe muscle weakness arises from hypoactive sarcomeres, while the
severe muscle contractures characteristic of Distal Arthrogryposis stem from hyperactive sarcomeres. Other
disorders, including inherited Muscular dystrophies, also involve altered sarcomere function. These diseases
establish the sarcomere as a crucial, yet highly underserved, target for therapeutic intervention. Skeletal muscle
diseases involving defective sarcomeres have no cure or effective treatments. A major challenge to progress
centers on the inherent complexities of sarcomere regulation. Recently, novel ON/OFF myosin cross-bridge
activation states under mechano-sensing regulatory control have been proposed to interface with the troponin-
tropomyosin system to regulate contraction. Working together, through dynamic inter-myofilament signaling, this
new view of sarcomere regulation has significant implications for muscle health and disease. To date, the data
supporting this model derives mainly from biophysical studies, with physiological relevance unclear and critical
to elucidate. We developed and validated a novel FRET-based sarcomere activation biosensor integrated into
the myofilaments of intact skeletal muscle. Preliminary data shows the biosensor detects conformational
changes in troponin, serving as a signaling nexus for real time reporting load-dependent inter-myofilament
signaling regulation of sarcomere activation during physiological contractions in live skeletal muscles. Guiding
hypothesis: Healthy skeletal muscle function requires precise sarcomere activation accomplished by dynamic
inter-myofilament signaling wherein thin filament regulation initiates and myosin sustains sarcomere activation
during physiological contraction; consequently, defective inter-myofilament signaling causes disease. The Aims
are to investigate physiological mechanisms of inter-myofilament signaling in regulating sarcomere activation
during twitch contractions in intact skeletal muscles and to investigate the effects myosin binding protein C as a
key mechano-sensor governing inter-myofilament signaling processes in regulating sarcomere activation during
twitch contractions in intact skeletal muscles. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying physiologically relevant
mechano-sensitive inter-myofilament signaling will provide the essential framework for advancing new
therapeutic discoveries to retain healthy skeletal muscle performance throughout lifespan, and to restore normal
skeletal muscle function in inherited myopathies."

 This first-time fellowship application proposes an integrated training and research plan focused on human
social interactions. The applicant has a strong and broad background in computational modeling of behavioral
human data, and will now leverage this in her postdoc at Caltech to learn how to model and analyze human
interactions from text-based chats and video interactions in behavior and in the brain (using fMRI). Aim 1 will
utilize state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing methods to annotate the visual, auditory
and text features of social interactions. Specific features, such as facial expressions and the semantic content
of text, will be extracted from 300 recorded social interactions between healthy adults. These features, in turn,
will be used to fit models that predict the social judgments that participants make about one another: how
trustworthy, friendly or arrogant do they judge their partner to be? A main goal of this first Aim is to extend human
social judgments beyond the typically narrow context used in past studies (e.g., static photos of faces) into the
naturalistic, interactive context we actually encounter in the real world. This emphasis will also be important for
future applications to psychiatric populations with critical deficits in social cognition (such as autism, outside the
scope of the present fellowship). Aim 2 translates the interactions of Aim 1 into neuroimaging, and BOLD-fMRI
will be acquired while participants watch previously recorded social interactions. This will reveal the brain regions
and networks that track the dynamic features of the stimuli. Neural representations of social inferences will be
extracted from multivariate activation patterns using representational similarity analysis, and similarity in neural
processing will be compared to similarity in behavioral social inference using inter-subject correlation analysis.
All analyses will both apply a whole-brain approach and will query specific social cognition networks. A main
goal of Aim 2 is to characterize the neural systems that subserve the dynamic construction of social attributions,
information that in future studies can be linked to individual differences and psychiatric illness."
10841683,"The KCNH2 gene (human ether-a-go-go-related gene, hERG) encodes the Kv11.1 K+ channel that
conducts the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) in the heart. The Kv11.1 channel contributes to
the repolarization of cardiac action potentials and plays an important role in both inherited and drug-induced
forms of long QT syndrome. Several alternatively processed mRNA isoforms have been identified in KCNH2.
Two of these isoforms, Kv11.1a and Kv11.1a-USO, are expressed at high levels in the heart. We have shown
that expression of Kv11.1a and Kv11.1a-USO are generated by alternative splicing and polyadenylation of
KCNH2 pre-mRNA. The full-length Kv11.1a isoform is produced by the splicing of intron 9 and polyadenylation
at a poly(A) site in exon 15, whereas Kv11.1a-USO is generated by polyadenylation at a poly(A) site in intron 9.
Because only the Kv11.1a isoform is functional, the alternative processing of KCNH2 pre-mRNA represents a
post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates Kv11.1 channel function. More importantly, disruption of this
regulation leads to long QT syndrome. The relative expression of Kv11.1a and Kv11.1a-USO is
developmentally regulated in the heart. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of Kv11.1 isoform
expression are not fully understood. In the present application, we propose to study the molecular mechanisms
underlying alternative splicing and polyadenylation of KCNH2 pre-mRNA and the role of alternative splicing
and polyadenylation in regulation of Kv11.1 isoform expression during heart development and in inherited and
drug-induced long QT syndrome. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify the cis-acting elements that regulate
alternative splicing and polyadenylation of KCNH2 pre-mRNA and to develop strategies to restore expression
of the functional Kv11.1a isoform disrupted by a long QT syndrome-associated mutation. Aim 2: To study
effects of RNA binding proteins CELF1, CELF2 and SF3B1 on regulation of Kv11.1 isoform expression. Aim 3:
To study mechanisms of developmental regulation of Kv11.1 isoform expression in a humanized knock-in
mouse model. Aim 4: To study effects of SF3B1 inhibitors, a new class of anticancer drugs, on Kv11.1 isoform
expression. The results from these studies will provide detailed information about the molecular mechanisms of
alternative splicing and polyadenylation of KCNH2 pre-mRNA and how this process is regulated in normal and
disease conditions. Elucidating these mechanisms will strengthen our understanding of post-transcriptional
regulation of Kv11.1 channel expression and have important implications in the assessment of arrhythmogenic
liability during drug development."

10843039,"ABSTRACT – BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SURVEY RESEARCH SHARED RESOURCE
 The purpose of the new Behavioral Health and Survey Research (BHSR) Shared Resource is to provide
Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) members with evidence-based behavioral and epidemiological research methods
to enable patient centered research. Behavioral and epidemiological research can serve as the bridge that helps
translate science to the communities that we serve, and is thus a major priority for the DCI. BHSR investigators
and staff have the extensive experience needed to help meet this need, including expertise in survey design,
qualitative research, and educational materials development. Rigorous implementation of these approaches in
DCI investigators’ research programs will help faculty address scientific questions across cancer continuum:
prevention, detection, treatment, survivorship and palliative care for both patients and their families.
 Since its inception with CCSG developmental funds from the DCI in 2015, and following its approval as a
DCI and Duke School of Medicine Shared Resource in January 2017, the BHSR has pursued two main goals:
1) to foster communication and collaborative exchange among DCI clinical, basic, and population science
investigators and 2) to promote standardization, rigor, and centralization of methods among DCI faculty. The
BHSR accomplishes these goals by providing research consultation and technical support through three
essential lines of service: 1) qualitative data collection and analysis, 2) survey development, and 3) educational
materials development. The BHSR is committed to providing the highest quality support and has implemented
strong business practices to ensure efficient and timely provision of services. With continued growth, a critical
future direction for the BHSR will be to convene a BHSR Scientific Advisory Board that includes patients and
family members to help guide use of research methods and growth.
 Since its inception in January 2015, we have provided services to 46 clients, 39 of whom were DCI members.
In 2018 alone, the Behavioral Health and Survey Research shared resource provided services to 19
investigators, 14 of whom were DCI members, accounting for 75% of total usage, from 5 of the 8 DCI Research
Programs. Use of this shared resource by DCI Members contributed to 17 publications over the project period."
10843040,"ABSTRACT – BIOINFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE
 The Bioinformatics (BIn) shared resource, a core function of the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), serves as a
centralized resource for expertise in applied and theoretical cancer bioinformatics, genomics, computational
biology, machine learning and statistical genetics. The faculty and staff members of this shared resource support
DCI members across the continuum of research, including experimental and statistical design for genomic
studies, complex genomic data management, integration of diverse data sets, computing and statistical analysis,
and machine learning. The shared resource provides support for investigator-generated data as well as
retrospective data from research databases (e.g., GDC [large datasets like TCGA] or dbGAP). The resource’s
mission is to provide high-quality, service-oriented, coordinated and cost-efficient bioinformatics support and
infrastructure for DCI members. Emphasis is placed on facilitating increased collaborations across DCI programs
and other DCI shared resources. The mission of this shared resource is addressed within the framework of
adherence to 3 principles: 1- sound data provenance and statistical principles, 2- literate programming, and 3-
reproducible analysis. The BIn shared resource provides and runs standardized genomic analysis pipelines (e.g.,
germline, tumor and cell-free DNA-Seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq, CHiP-Seq, and sequencing of T-Cell
Receptor repertoire and microbiome). These pipelines are constructed on the basis of state-of-the-art published
tools, maintained under strict source code version control and designed to be extensible and deployable in a
scalable fashion on local servers and cloud services.
 The philosophy of the BIn shared resource is that the scope of scientific discovery and rigor should neither
be limited nor compromised due to lack of appropriate and adequate statistical methodology or computational
tools. When needed and appropriate, the faculty and staff of the shared resource extend or revise existing or
develop de novo methods and computational tools to enable DCI members to address scientific questions with
requisite rigor and efficiency. In addition to computing and analysis support, the shared resource provides
extensive support for writing of scientific abstracts and manuscripts, as well as grant proposals. The BIn shared
resource also serves as a liaison and facilitator between DCI members and other DCI shared resources (e.g.,
the Biostatistics, Functional Genomics, Information Systems, and BioRepository and Precision Pathology Center
Shared Resources). The research support, services and resources of the BIn shared resource are provided
exclusively to DCI members.
 In 2018, the BIn shared resource provided services to 53 investigators, 100% of whom were DCI members,
accounting for 100% of total usage, from all 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of this shared resource by DCI
members contributed to 178 publications over the project period, 41 of which were in high impact journals,
demonstrating the value of services offered by the resource."
10843043,"ABSTRACT – BIOREPOSITORY & PRECISION PATHOLOGY CENTER SHARED RESOURCE
 The BioRepository & Precision Pathology Center (BRPC) provides patient tissue and blood-based research
support for the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI). Major service areas are Biobanking (BRPC broad consent, tissue,
blood and fluid sample procurement, processing, storage and distribution including for the BRPC’s patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) and primary cell culture (PCC) service lines, tumor enrichment through
macro/microdissection, DNA/RNA extraction), Regulatory (protocol review, scope of work creation, budgeting,
integration with broad consent if possible), and ImmunoHistology (traditional histology, single and multiplexed
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, tissue microarray creation, whole slide imaging and image analysis).
Regarding the Biobanking service, the BRPC administers Duke’s largest broad consent protocol for specimen
collection for research, which is becoming the backbone consent for new microbiome initiatives and has
consented >4,700 patients since 2012. Of these patients, 17% are African American and 4% other non-
Caucasian, supporting research into cancers of underserved minorities. The BRPC also operates a College of
American Pathologists’ (CAP)-accredited biorepository of normal and diseased samples representing a range of
solid and hematolymphoid pathologies. Banking activities occur in conjunction with blood draws, standard-of-
care biopsy and surgical procedures and clinical trial-supported tissue acquisitions. BRPC prioritizes activities
based on instructions of DCI’s disease-site group leaders. Often a single biobanking event can simultaneously
supply multiple ongoing research efforts, prepare a PDX model, prepare PCCs, and stock the biobank for future
needs. BRPC biospecimens also are being used in Phase III of the NCI’s CPTAC project. The BRPC also serves
as the administrative and regulatory backbone for the DCI’s Personalized Cancer Medicine Initiative (PCMI),
which links genomic information, clinical annotation, and biospecimens. The gateway to the paraffin tissue
archives in the Department of Pathology, BRPC provides regulatory support, cohort identification, and
pathologist review for retrospective studies using those archives. BRPC rapidly retrieves and prepares patients’
paraffin archival tissue samples for submission to clinical trial sponsors. Finally, the BRPC provides specialized
tissue processing and experimental services including basic histology, veterinary pathology support for animal
models, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization assays, tissue microarray creation, tumor enrichment by
microdissection and laser capture microdissection, whole slide imaging and image analysis algorithms. BRPC
biospecimens contributed to the Cancer Genome Atlas Project have supported numerous high-impact
publications in Cell, Nature, Cancer Cell, and Cell Reports.
 In 2018, the BRPC provided services to 177 investigators, 58% of whom were DCI members who accounted
for 92% of total usage and represented all 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of BRPC by DCI Members,

 The Flow Cytometry (FC) shared resource supports Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) investigators with sorting
and/or analyzing populations of cells based on expression of surface proteins or fluorescent reporters, and
performing batch or single-cell sorting. Flow cytometry allows investigators to analyze parameters such as cell
death, cell cycle, cell signaling, and cytokine production as a function of cellular state or stimulation.
 Our Specific Aims are: 1) Maintain state-of-the-art cell sorters and cell analyzers in a cost-effective manner
to meet DCI research needs; 2) Provide expertise in assay development, troubleshooting, and data analysis;
and 3) Train DCI members to use cytometers independently.
 The resource maintains four analyzers, four cell sorters, and one image cytometer; analyzers and the image
cytometer are available for self-use, 24 hrs per day and 365 days per year. FC staff is actively engaged in DCI
member research projects, working closely with clients to fine tune their individual experiments and develop
strategies for best outcomes in real time. Based on our extensive experience, we are able to recommend assays,
to help develop and troubleshoot new protocols, and participate in data analysis. The FC’s experienced staff
performs cell sorting, cell analysis, and post-acquisition data handling. These services would otherwise be
unaffordable to investigators, given the costs, time, and training required to purchase, use, and maintain the
necessary equipment. Flow cytometry services are not outsourced easily, given the fragile and time-sensitive
nature of the cell preparations and the experimental protocols.
 An important and continuing mission of the FC resource is educating clients to ensure that all DCI members
use the services and technology that best support their research goals. We provide ongoing training in the use
of cytometers and associated software, and maintain a library to disseminate technical information to users. DCI
members receive priority services, and FC operates on a charge-back basis with different rates for staff-run or
self-run work. DCI member laboratories get added value in the form of a 25% discount on usage fees compared
to non-DCI member labs.
 In 2018, the FC provided services to 190 investigators, 61% of whom were DCI members who accounted for
78% of total usage and represented all 8 DCI Research Programs. Use of the shared resource by DCI Members,

Biological processes that guard against melanoma are generally successful. Thus, to understand melanoma
etiology we must identify the flaws in these mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis. This proposal will elucidate
deficiencies in the cellular mechanisms that combat UV damage and define the tumorigenic consequences of
melanocyte pigment production. Our studies will improve mechanistic understanding of melanoma etiology by
revealing gaps in the physiological processes that block UV carcinogenesis.
We hypothesize that melanoma progression is influenced by melanin production and accelerated by the
persistence of unresolved DNA lesions specific to the initiating UV wavelength. To test this hypothesis we
will define how full-spectrum (UVA/B) and partitioned solar irradiation (UVA or UVB) influence the onset and
progression of melanoma in genetically relevant, Braf- and Nras-mutant mouse models. We will elucidate
transcriptional and mutational patterns enriched in tumors driven by each UV spectrum and oncogene, and use
this information to define how UV lesions escape repair (Aim 1). Next, we will cross our models to eumelanotic
(black), amelanotic (albino) or pheomelanotic (red/yellow) alleles to determine how melanin impacts the
formation, progression and immunotherapeutic response of Braf- and Nras-mutant melanomas accelerated by
different UV spectra (Aim 2). Knowledge gained from these experiments will aid in the development of melanoma
preventatives that progress beyond sunscreens, including interventions that mitigate UV carcinogenesis after an

10845212,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (PILOT PROJECT)
A number of autoimmune endocrinopathies are sex biased, with strong female predisposition For instance,
female:male prevalence ratios have been estimated to be 19:1 for autoimmune thyroiditis. Previous work has
suggested a role for divergent levels of sex hormones as an underlying cause. In particular, increased androgen
signaling drives expression of the transcription factor TCF7, which dampens conversion of CD8+ T cell progenitor
to effector cells. The resultant decrease in the pool of effectors, the cell type mediating direct destruction of
endocrine tissues, protects from endocrine autoimmunity. Our recent data point to an additional role for increased
X chromosome copy number in female sex bias, since deficiency of the X-linked gene UTX also suppresses
progenitor to effector conversion. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that sex differences in human autoimmune
endocrinopathies is driven by both increased X-linked UTX expression and lower androgen levels in females. In
Aim 1, we will determine the role of the X-linked genes promoting progenitor to effector conversion. We will utilize
virally-mediated UTX overexpression to determine the effects of this X-linked gene in effector differentiation.
Additionally, we will query effector differentiation in CD8+ T cells from patients with Klinefelter Syndrome, a
condition in which phenotypic males have an extra X chromosome (47XXY). In Aim 2, we will determine the
effects of androgen and estrogen signaling on TCF7 expression and progenitor to effector conversion.
Understanding mechanisms underlying sex differences is critical for identifying new drug targets and tailoring
therapeutic approaches in a personalized manner for patients with autoimmune endocrinopathies."

This proposal, entitled ""Zebrafish Development and Genetics"", requests support for an intensive two-week
laboratory and lecture course held at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) for advanced graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and independent investigators that focuses on the development and genetics of zebrafish,
with special emphasis on the mechanistic basis of embryogenesis, organogenesis, and regeneration. In its
24th year, the MBL Zebrafish course is still the only one of its kind worldwide, covering time-proven and newly-
developed technologies and their applications in zebrafish. Mornings and afternoons are devoted primarily to
laboratory exercises punctuated with interactive workshops, while the evenings are typically spent on data
evaluation, lectures by leading figures in the international zebrafish community, and discussions.
During the first week of the course, students learn concepts and techniques that are crucial for most zebrafish
laboratories working on embryos and larvae: staging and anatomy, microscopy, microinjection, in situ
hybridization, immunohistochemistry and imaging. Emphasis is placed on best practices for achieving rigor and
reproducibility using each approach. The first week also focuses on genetics, with workshops covering genome
editing and web-based genomics resources. The second week focuses on development and function of
various organ systems, including concepts and techniques related to specific developmental disorders and
tissue regeneration. Having been introduced to embryonic, larval, and adult anatomy in week one, students
then learn techniques for labeling, ablating and transplanting cells to assess cell fate, morphogenesis and
regeneration. Emphasis is placed on high-resolution live imaging of fluorescent transgenic reporters, including
quantitative approaches for tracking cell movement and cell shape changes. Additionally, the course teaches
techniques for studying larval visual and locomotor behaviors, including the genes and neural circuits involved.
Throughout the two-week course, laboratory sessions are interspersed with workshop-style roundtable
discussions that cover practical aspects of zebrafish research (e.g. when to select fish as a model organism,
best practices in fish husbandry) and discuss the latest developments in the field (e.g. strategies for disease
modeling, single cell ""-omics""). Finally, each of the course faculty presents a lecture centered on their current
research. These highly interactive seminars are considered to be a highlight of the course, as they frequently
nucleate engaging discussions about outstanding biological questions that extend well into the evening.
The MBL Zebrafish course has received rave reviews from previous trainees. It strives both for scientific
excellence as well as to train a diverse and inclusive group of scientists joining the zebrafish community. It is
carefully crafted to provide newcomers to the zebrafish field with training in essential techniques and cutting-
edge strategies used in this system. In addition, by facilitating interactions with leading figures in zebrafish
research, the course creates a fruitful ground for its students to network and develop enduring collaborations."

The human gut microbiome is a key determinant of health and one crucial function of this community is to regulate host metabolism by fermenting host-indigestible dietary components. A significant body of work also indicates that in both humans and animals, antibiotic use – and especially the use of penicillins and other β-lactams – is strongly associated with obesity. The mechanism of this antibiotic-associated weight gain is not fully understood, although many theories exist, ranging from the induction of systemic inflammation to the reduction of pathogen burden. Understanding how antibiotic-induced perturbations of the microbiome lead to complications such as obesity is an essential step towards alleviating this problem. The proposed work will contribute to this goal by defining the impacts of antibiotics on the metabolic environment of the murine gut, host metabolite availability, and weight gain. Antibiotics can disrupt the microbiome, but what is less appreciated is that this perturbation is associated with a disruption of the metabolic capacity of gut bacteria and a concomitant perturbation of the gut metabolome. The Belenky Lab has defined the impacts of several clinically-relevant antibiotics on the composition and transcriptional response of the murine microbiome. This previous work identified that antibiotics, specifically amoxicillin, change the composition, transcriptional activity, and the metabolome of the murine cecal microbiome. The resulting microbial community is metabolically deficient, enriched for Bacteroidetes, and devoid of Firmicutes. These changes are associated with reduced cecal glucose, reduced butyrate, elevated blood glucose, systemic inflammation, and weight gain. The core hypothesis of this work is that β-lactam antibiotics contribute to inflammation and obesity by eliminating critical bacteria in the Firmicutes phylum, subsequently inducing metabolic dysfunction. The resulting metabolically-deficient gut microbiome is unable to provide critical nutrients and signaling molecules to reduce inflammation and regulate host metabolism. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three aims: Aim 1 – Determine the impact of clinically-relevant antibiotics on the metabolome and taxonomic composition of the murine gut, host physiology, and weight gain. Aim 2 – Utilize microbial consortia to determine if microbial composition associated with antibiotic therapy is linked to the detected metabolite shifts and host impacts. Aim 3 – Microbiome restoration and diet modulation to reduce antibiotic-induced perturbations of the gut metabolome and weight gain. The insight gained from this work will help to identify methodologies that reduce antibiotic-mediated microbiome disruption and may help to combat the obesity crisis. Antibiotics have been miracle drugs, but now that we understand the significant cost to microbiome function, we must find better ways to use them."

10849743,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ranging from penicillin to artemisinin, natural products have been essential in the discovery and
development of new drugs. To complement the traditional activity-guided isolation approaches, genome mining
techniques can enable an efficient and high throughput discovery pipeline by specifically targeting promising
organisms and gene clusters for detailed study. However, detailed understanding of a biosynthetic pathway is
typically needed, significantly constraining the search process. Therefore, alternative bioinformatic approaches
combined with detailed biochemical characterization and bioactivity studies will help expand our collective
understanding of bioactive secondary metabolites in nature and their value for human health.
 The overall focus of the Chekan lab is to utilize enzyme-independent genome mining as a guide to enable
the discovery and detailed study of new types of bioactive natural products and biosynthetic pathways. This
proposal focuses on the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) family of
natural products. RiPPs are a ubiquitous family of natural products found across all domains of life and possess
a wide range of bioactivities, with antibiotic activity being particularly well represented. These natural products
all share a consistent biosynthetic logic, but can be generated from a wide variety of biosynthetic enzymes. In
order to discover completely new classes of RiPPs, we propose to exploit conserved biosynthetic and structural
features instead of specific enzymatic transformations. This will allow for rapid in silico identification of promising
biosynthetic gene clusters that generate never before isolated molecules. To fully study and characterize these
new pathways, a combination of biochemical and structural approaches will be employed. These results will give
important insights into the new biosynthetic enzymes, reveal their mechanisms, and assess their applicability for
engineering. Finally, this first project will reveal the bioactivity of the newly discovered natural products and their
mechanism of action. To complement this discovery element, a second project will seek to link peptidic natural
product families, for which no biosynthetic information is available, to their biosynthetic enzymes. This proposal
will also enable the training of both graduate students and postdocs, the next generation of scientists responsible
for advancing human health. Overall, the results of this proposal will not only lead to the discovery of new natural
products and enzymes, but will inform future genome mining based discovery studies and pathway engineering
efforts to identify promising drug leads."
10847098,"Project Summary/Abstract
This mixed-methods pilot study will develop and test a Supervision Assist App (SuperAssist) for implementing
Client-Centered Supervision (CCS) to improve supervision practices for mental health providers (providers)
and ultimately improve their job well-being and skills, the quality of care, and outcomes for clients. The quality
of mental health services in the United States relies greatly on the quality of front-line providers. However,
burnout and high turnover are prevalent among this population. Innovative supervision practices are needed to
address both the workforce challenges and the quality of care for clients they serve. CCS could help maximize
providers’ strengths in engaging with clients around recovery goals while addressing their challenges on the
job. The specific aims are: Aim 1: design and develop a SuperAssist beta version; Aim 2: conduct beta-testing
of SuperAssist; and Aim 3: evaluate the feasibility and explore preliminary outcomes and change mechanisms
of SuperAssist. In Aim 1, we will design and develop SuperAssist in collaboration with providers and
supervisors at community mental health organizations via a user-centered and participatory app development
approach. We will also develop a SuperAssist training manual. In Aim 2, we will invite 20 providers and their
supervisors to beta testing to seek their feedback with the goal of tailoring the app to its end-users. The testers
will use the app for six months after the SuperAssist training, provide feedback for improvement through semi-
structured interviews after 1 month, then every two months, and complete process and outcome measures of
SuperAssist, during the beta testing period. In Aim 3, we will recruit 40 providers and their supervisors for the
experimental condition and the other 40 for the control condition (treatment as usual). The experimental group
will receive the SuperAssist training and use the app for six months, and participate in online surveys (baseline
[prior to implementation], 3 mo., and 6 mo.), as well as semi-structured interviews after 6 months of usage. We
will use these data along with app response data to evaluate the feasibility and primary outcomes (i.e., provider
job well-being and skills, quality of care, client outcomes) of SuperAssist. The control group will not receive the
SuperAssist training or use the app but will complete the same outcome measures except for the SuperAssist
usability questions. We will also collect recovery outcomes from clients receiving services from participating
providers (i.e., two clients per provider). Key proposed mechanisms of action (i.e., supervisory support, role
clarity) will also be assessed. We hypothesize that improved supervisory support facilitated by SuperAssist
leads to increased care quality and outcomes via job well-being and client-centered practice. Successful
completion of this study will result in an innovative supervision support tool to implement CCS, which can be
readily transferred to community mental health practice settings to improve the workforce well-being and
quality of care, ultimately leading to improved client outcomes. The study goal is aligned with the NIMH priority
of developing innovative service delivery models to dramatically improve mental health service outcomes."

This proposal seeks continued support for the Yale research training program in Diabetes Mellitus and
Disorders of Metabolism. This program remains the core of support for postdoctoral research training in
diabetes and metabolic diseases at the Yale School of Medicine. We strive to provide physicians and
scientists with the training required to pursue academic careers in clinical, translational and basic research.
Physician trainees entering the program will have MD or MD, PhD degress and at least 2-3 years of clinical
training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Post-doctoral PhD scientist are also recruited into the program since
we believe an integrated training experience bringing together adult endocrinologists, pediatric
endocrinologists and endocrine scientists will prepare our trainees to participate in modern multidisciplinary
research groups. We also now propose to introduce pre-doctoral PhD and MD, PhD students selected from
the Yale Graduate School and MSTP programs who will enter the new Yale graduate BBS Program in
Translational Biomedicine (PTB). All trainees will be selected based on their aptitude and commitment to
research careers in diabetes and/or metabolism. Post-doctoral training will encompass at least three years to
ensure an in-depth training experience leading to an independent research career. Pre-doctoral training is
anticipated to cover years 3 and 4 of the PhD degree. The cornerstone of both curricula is participation in a
specific research project under the supervision of a designated preceptor and guided by a progress committee
or thesis committee composed of 2-3 other members of the training faculty. Potential projects run the gamut
from clinical to basic research in 3 primary areas of emphasis: 1) T1D, 2) T2D, and 3) bone and mineral
metabolism. Trainees have the opportunity to work with mentors in multiple basic science departments as well
as those in Pediatrics and Medicine. Close interactions among preceptors and trainees within each
programmatic area are enhanced by the interdepartmental Diabetes Research Center adminstered within the
Endocrine Section. In this cycle, we have also recruited members of the new basic science focused Yale
Center for Molecular and System Metabolism to further enrich research opportunites. Instruction is also
provided through organized lectures, research seminars and journal clubs. The application requests a reduced
allotment of 5 post-doctoral stipends per year as well as 2 new pre-doctoral slots to support graduate student
education in the PTB. This request is based on our longstanding and outstanding track record of training
successful investigators who remain in academic research careers, our ongoing ability to attract outstanding
applicants, the high level of research productivity of our training faculty, the expansive palette of research
opportunities provided by our faculty and the continued shortage of physician-scientists and scientists that are
dedicated to research careers in diabetes and metabolic diseases."

The long-term goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of how the external globus pallidus (GPe)
within the basal ganglia controls movement and how it goes awry in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite
compelling evidence that the GPe plays a critical role in regulating motor activity, its neuronal composition has
been poorly defined. As the neurons that encompass the GPe are heterogeneous, understanding how the
activity of the GPe is regulated in behavioral and disease contexts has posed a challenge. Through a series of
investigations during the last funding cycle, we surveyed the molecular landscape of the mouse GPe. By
characterizing a number of driver and reporter lines, we have now established a near-complete neuron
taxonomy of the GPe. Using the newly available genetic tools in conjunction with cell- and circuit-specific
approaches, we began to understand how GPe neuron subtypes control full-body movements. In this
application, we will examine the activity dynamics of GPe neuron subtypes and their regulation of their
synaptic partners to clarify the mechanisms involved. These experiments will provide new information about
how motor inhibition is produced by the GPe and the basal ganglia as a whole. Using a well-established chronic
model of PD, we will provide unprecedented insights into how alterations in these processes underlie
hypokinetic symptoms of PD. The yielded knowledge will not only inform the processes underlying motor
(dys)function but will also help develop circuit interventions that target the hypokinetic symptoms of PD."

Our mechanistic work has established general principles of metabolic reprogramming in PDAC, revealing 
therapeutic insights that show dramatic effects in preclinical models (alanine metabolism blockade) as well as 
benefit in the clinic (autophagy inhibition). In this next cycle, we seek to address two key questions to enable us 
to most effectively define and exploit metabolic vulnerabilities in PDAC. First, how do the different concurrent 
cancer gene mutations that define PDAC subsets influence cancer cell metabolism and the metabolic interplay 
with the TME? Secondly, what role does regulation of mitochondria, organelles central to integration of 
metabolism and innate immune signals, play in metabolic reprogramming and cancer-­stroma cell interactions in 
genetic subsets of Kras* PDAC? By developing a series of novel GEM models and patient-­derived KRAS* PDAC 
models representing major genotypes, we have identified pronounced genetically-­driven differences in tumor 
cell metabolism and cancer-­immune cell interactions. We hypothesize that cooperating genetic alterations drive 
distinct metabolic programs and associated vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Moreover, we predict that immune 
differences will further influence cancer cell metabolism in these distinct genetic settings. To address these 
hypotheses, we propose the following aims: #1 Determine the influence of major PDAC gene mutations on 
metabolic programs;? #2 Assess role of the autophagy/lysosome system on tumor-­TME crosstalk in genetic 
subsets of PDAC;? and, #3 Investigate mitochondrial regulation and relationship to metabolism and inflammatory 
signaling in PDAC subsets."

The desmoplastic stroma, consisting of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells, is a defining 
feature of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), however its precise contribution to cancer 
progression is still evolving. Type I collagen (Col1), a dominant component of PDAC desmoplasia, is uniquely 
regulated in PDAC. Our preliminary studies uncovered that cancer cells produce a novel Col1 variant consisting 
of alpha 1 chain (Col1a1) homotrimers. Genetic deletion of the oncogenic Col1 in cancer cells extends the overall 
lifespan of PDAC genetically engineered mice (GEMs). Oncogenic Kras (Kras*), a central driver for PDAC, plays 
a key role in determining the host response, including tumor immunity and metabolic adaptation. We discovered 
that Kras* drives cancer cells’ production of oncogenic Col1 via epigenetic silencing of Col1a2. In contrast with 
the classical Col1 heterotrimer produced by fibroblasts, oncogenic Col1 uniquely promotes PDAC initiation and 
progression by influencing tumor metabolism and immunity. Col1 homotrimers bind to a?3b?1 integrin on PDAC 
cancer cells, a collagen receptor distinctly upregulated in mouse and human PDAC. This induces a sustained 
activation of FAK, Akt and Erk1/2 when compared with Col1 heterotrimers, promoting cancer cells growth and 
survival. Oncogenic Col1 also suppresses intratumoral T cells, and oncogenic Col1 deletion synergizes with anti-­
PD-­1 immune checkpoint blockade to suppress tumor growth and increase overall survival of PDAC GEMs. 
Cancer cell-­directed oncogenic Col1 homotrimer signaling also enhances glycolysis and mTOR signaling, 
supporting the metabolic reprogramming driven by Kras*. In Project 3, in close collaboration with Projects 1 and 
2, we will define the role and regulation of Kras*-­induced oncogenic Col1 signaling in impacting tumor immunity 
and metabolism. The proposed aims investigate Col1 homotrimers-­ a?3b?1 integrin targeting, immunotherapy, and 
anti-­metabolism strategies, as an informed combination treatment modality. Our preliminary data support the 
feasibility and significance of this novel approach, and exploit a new vulnerability in PDAC signaling, with a 
translational potential to inform new therapies for PDAC."

The study of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents unique challenges given its formidably
complex histopathology, the many diverse cell types of the tumor microenvirionment (TME), myriad genetic
abnormalities and associated biological impact, and practical limitations of tissue availability and quality. Our
pathology team, with its deep expertise in mouse and human PDAC, has played a central and essential role in
the pathologic analysis of virtually all experiments of this P01 since its inception. Broadly speaking, these
activities include evaluation of genetically engineered mice (GEM), including mice with temporally regulated,
compartment-specific disruption in epithelial and / or stromal components; analyses of tumor promoting signaling
pathways with cell-type specific localization to either neoplastic cells per se, or within the host response in the
TME; identification and multi-dimensional assessments of cellular components within the TME; and the cross-
species validation of observations between GEM models and human tumor samples. The Pathology Core will
continue to collect, maintain, archive and record all human and mouse PDAC-associated biological resources.
These materials include organoids created from primary and metastatic human and mouse PDAC, and a
repository of annotated low-passage PDAC cell lines. Core A will work in close collaboration with the Project
Investigators to achieve three specific aims: i) to provide histology services and consultative expertise, including
centralized review in the pathologic evaluation of mouse and human pancreatic neoplasms; ii) to provide
infrastructure and technical expertise for a variety of immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent and in situ
hybridization assays with quantitative image analysis; and iii) to generate, characterize and maintain organoid
models, as well as early passage tumor and stromal cells cultures for use by the Projects as well as for allele
engineering in The Modeling & Experimental Therapeutics Core. A testament to this Core’s progress stems from
the creation of >165 PDXs and >30 low passage PDAC cell lines during the previous cycle. Core A’s leader is
Dr. Huamin Wang at MDACC, joined by Co-Investigators Drs. Anirban Maitra and Michael Kim- bring long-
standing expertise, numerous P01 collaborations and a strong publication record in the histopathological and
molecular assessment of human and murine PDAC tissues. Core A will build upon the strong foundation of prior

10854875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently no consensus exists in clinical guidelines for management of patients with asymptomatic carotid artery
stenosis (ACAS). Some guidelines recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) surgery for patients with ACAS of
≥ 60% diameter. However, it is argued that 95% of all surgical interventions for ACAS in the United States may
be unnecessary, generating needless healthcare costs of >$2 billion annually. Our goal in this proposal is to
study plaque biology in ACAS patients through PET imaging at the molecular level to help identify individuals
who are at 'higher-risk’ for ischemic stroke from plaque rupture and may benefit from carotid surgical intervention.
We propose a 2-center patient outcomes study that expands upon data and observations from our earlier single
center first-in-human study at Washington University using a nanoparticle PET radiotracer that targets the
natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPRC) to determine if it can be used to risk stratify patients with ‘higher-risk’
ACAS. We and others have shown that NPRC is expressed at higher levels in complex plaques with features
of vulnerability in patients with ACAS. In our most recent NIH R01-funded proof-of-concept study in a cohort of
42 patients with ACAS, we have shown linear correlation between 64Cu-CANF-Comb PET radiotracer uptake
and features of high-risk plaque and correlative 64Cu-CANF-Comb PET uptake to the presence of NPRC in CEA
specimens of patients who underwent surgery. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To determine
the ability of 64Cu-CANF-Comb PET to risk stratify ACAS patients treated with optimal medical therapy
(OMT) alone with respect to patient outcomes. In this observational study, 80 patients with ACAS ≥ 60% will
undergo 64Cu-CANF-Comb PET/MRI. Patients will be maintained on either OMT alone or receive OMT and CEA
as determined by their treating vascular surgeon prior to imaging. OMT will consist of antiplatelet, statin, and
hypertension and diabetes management when applicable. All patients will be evaluated with phone interviews
every 3 months for a minimum of 18 months to assess for ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular event. PET signal
will be assessed as a marker of risk for event or progression to CEA in comparison to anatomic features of
vulnerable plaque on MRI, with the goal of determining a PET signal threshold which suggests higher risk ACAS.
Aim 2: To further understand the role of NPRC in the evolution of carotid atherosclerosis. A. Patients
treated with OMT alone will undergo repeat PET/MRI at 18 months, or earlier if they develop symptoms. PET/MRI
changes over the 18-month interval will be used to further understand the biology of carotid plaque evolution
after treatment with OMT. B. In patients who initially undergo CEA, PET signal will be compared to ex vivo plaque
vulnerability and NPRC cellular distribution to facilitate understanding of gene expression using
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cell origin through single cell RNA/CITE-seq transcriptomics. Results will
provide information on the potential of a new imaging approach, 64Cu-CANF-Comb PET, to risk stratify patients
with ACAS and reveal mechanistic information about the role of NPRC in plaque vulnerability and inflammation."
10854876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More 10% of the new infections in the United States were from contaminated needle sharing among
people who inject drugs (PWID). Importantly, only about 50% of men and 57% of women of the PWID
group had suppressed viremia. Despite the lack of a sterilizing HIV-1 cure, antiretroviral drug therapies
(ART) effectively suppress viral replication in people living with HIV-1. One limitation of ART is that
these small molecule drugs cannot eliminate the viral reservoir. Broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs) could supplement ART and be used to reduce the viral reservoir. Several studies have shown
that a single dose of a bNAb can decrease viremia in HIV-1 infected individuals, with viral rebound
occurring as the bNAb concentration decreases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors may provide
the means for long-term expression of bNAbs at concentrations capable of maintaining viral
suppression via intramuscular inoculations. However, we and others have shown that the emergence of
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to bNAbs limits their overall expression. Here, we show that we have made
significant strides overcome this host immune response. First is through utilizing immune checkpoints
that regulate immune system pathways. We observed a 21-fold increase in concentrations of the HIV-1
bNAb 10-1074 in rhesus macaques when macaques were co-inoculated with an AAV vector encoding
rhesus macaque PD-L1. Second, we have developed a novel, HIV-1 entry inhibitor, eCD4-Ig, which
tends to be more tolerated in rhesus macaques when expressed from AAV vectors. Unlike bNAbs, we
have shown that AAV vectors encoding eCD4-Ig can express the inhibitor in macaques for over a year
and the ADA response against eCD4-Ig decreases over time. Because eCD4-Ig neutralizes all HIV-1,
HIV-2, and SIV isolates and is difficult to escape, it may be useful when included in a therapy strategy.
Our pilot studies show that low concentrations AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig can suppress SHIV infection in
rhesus macaques for two years, yet viremia is still detectable. This proposal combines our AAV
advancements into a single strategy to determine whether AAV-expressed inhibitors can suppress a
SHIV infection and reduce the viral reservoir. In Aim 1, we will assess the therapeutic efficacy of the
combination of AAV-delivered eCD4-Ig and 10-1074 after ART is lifted in SHIV-infected rhesus
macaques. In Aim 2, we will determine whether suppressing an established SHIV infection with AAV-
delivered eCD4-Ig and 10-1074 results in a quantitatively different viral reservoir compared to ART. In
Aim 3, we will improve the safety of AAV gene therapy by developing an irreversible “kill-switch” to turn
off transgene expression."
10859982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human cancers can be classified according to their cellular lineage, which is often defined by the presence of
master regulator transcription factors. In several clinical contexts, opportunities exist to target master regulators
as a therapeutic strategy (e.g. antagonists of the Androgen Receptor or degraders of Ikaros/Aiolos). However,
scenarios also exist in which the aberrant expression of a master regulator can promote lineage plasticity, which
can allow tumor cells to evade targeted therapies. These clinical observations highlight the importance of
investigating the biology and mechanisms of lineage master regulators in oncology. Our lab recently reported
the existence of a tuft cell-like lineage of human carcinoma, which is a tumor defined by the expression of
POU2F3. We described tuft cell-like carcinomas as a non-neuroendocrine form of small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
however subsequent studies have shown that POU2F3+ carcinomas exist in several other organs as well. In this
research proposal, we seek to define the unique biology and molecular mechanisms that distinguish POU2F3+
carcinomas from other forms of human cancer, with a long-term objective of advancing therapeutic solutions for
this newly identified tumor lineage. The first Aim of this project will focus on revealing molecular mechanisms,
building upon our recent discovery of OCA-T1/OCA-T2 as obligate coactivators of POU2F3 in the tuft cell lineage.
For this work, we will employ our latest innovations in genome editing technology and epigenomics to define the
effectors of the POU2F3/OCA-T complex in POU2F3+ SCLC. These efforts will have potential to reveal
biochemical opportunities that allow for pharmacological modulation of POU2F3 in cancer. The second Aim will
evaluate the unique biological properties of neoplastic tuft cells in vivo, which builds upon our preliminary data
showing that engineering of cancer gene mutations into pulmonary tuft cells leads to the generation of SCLC-
like tumors that express POU2F3. These unique genetic models will allow us to explore biological questions that
would otherwise be impossible using human cancer cell lines. Specifically, we will investigate a) which specific
tumor genotypes are permissive for forming tuft cell carcinomas b) which tumor genotypes drive lineage plasticity
in this context, particularly transitions between tuft and neuroendocrine fates and c) how cytotoxic chemotherapy
selects for specific cellular states in the setting of a tuft cell carcinoma. The third Aim of this proposal seeks to
understand tuft cell identity as an acquired state and as a drug resistance mechanism in prostate
adenocarcinoma. We have developed methods for reprogramming carcinomas into a tuft cell state using
POU2F3/OCA-T co-expression, which we will incorporate into the RapidCaP model of prostate cancer to study
its impact on disease progression and castration resistance. Collectively, the research outlined in this proposal
will advance our fundamental understanding of the biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of POU2F3+ human
carcinomas."
10838193,"Project Summary. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) regulates tissue growth and repair in multiple organs. A
conserved mechanism of synthesis and degradation modulates PGE2 levels in response to trauma,
inflammation and disease. In particular, the enzyme 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the main
PGE2-degrading enzyme and therefore a key regulator of tissue repair and regeneration. 15-PGDH is an
attractive drug target for diseases characterized by tissue damage. Our team successfully developed the first
small molecule inhibitors of 15-PGDH with in vivo activities in multiple rodent models of disease related to
inflammatory bowel disease, renal disease, neurodegeneration and pulmonary fibrosis.
This RM1 grant supports a collaborative chemical, structural and cell-signaling interrogation of the role and
activity of 15-PGDH. Our expertise includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, pharmacology,
and structural biology. We have obtained the first 3-dimensional structure of 15-PGDH in complex with
inhibitors, and we have discovered a new class of inhibitors. Additionally, we have begun to decipher the
signaling pathways that regulate 15-PGDH and the pathways that are impacted by inhibition of 15-PGDH.
This supplement seeks to expand on unanticipated observations we have made during the course of our
studies over the last two years. In particular, we have discovered that cells up-regulate 15-PGDH in response
to inhibitors of 15-PGDH. Inhibitors block enzymatic function, but also stabilize the protein and prevent
degradation. Therefore, cells have more 15-PGDH enzyme after 24h treatment with inhibitor than they had
prior to drug treatment. In vivo, this pattern results in an unusual scenario in which 15-PGDH activity is
suppressed for ~12h, but then rebounds and overshoots basal levels by ~24h because of new protein
synthesis.
A new graduate student, Mr. Max Balderas, will study this phenomenon by developing 15-PGDH degrading
compounds. These PROTACs compounds will recruit E3 ligases to 15-PGDH and promote ubiquitination,
leading to degradation by the proteosome. These reagents will provide tools to compare three scenarios:
basal, chemical inhibition and chemical degradation of 15-PGDH. The experiments will help define the biology
upstream and downstream of 15-PGDH. Through these studies, Mr. Balderas will gain exposure to synthetic
chemistry, chemical biology, structural biology, biochemistry and cell biology. He will work with the larger team
and interact frequently with the other PI’s and their research teams. The broad-based research project will
provide a strong foundation for Mr. Balderas’ training in support of his longer term scientific and career

 The Pharmacological Sciences Training Program (PSTP) at the University of Iowa seeks to achieve
interdisciplinary and integrated training of a diverse cohort of graduate students in Pharmacological Sciences.
The result will be successful PhDs who are well prepared for career and leadership positions in pharmacology
in academia, government (e.g. regulatory agencies), pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, research institutes,
and science-related fields. In addition to training PhDs well-positioned for career success, our outcomes include
publication of first-author and collaborative papers, success in obtaining individual, nationally- competitive
fellowships, at or below-average time to degree, and establishing an inclusive and supportive environment
conducive to intellectual growth and scientific development. This program is built upon a foundation of an
existing Interdisciplinary T32 in Pharmacological Sciences established in 2004, and we build on elements of this
program with new programmatic, evaluation, and curricular plans, which bring greater focus on mentorship, team
science, rigorous and reproducible research, and career development.
 The pool of trainees eligible for this program at the University of Iowa is talented and deep. Drawing from
53 mentor laboratories in 13 degree-granting programs across 3 colleges (Medicine, Pharmacy, Liberal Arts &
Sciences), we aim for 6 trainees per year to join our program, each appointed for two years (their 2nd and 3rd
years of graduate study) for a total of 12 trainee positions. We request funding of only 9 positions, however,
because the three participating colleges have pledged support of one matching position each. Our 6 proposed
trainees are selected annually from a large pool of strong applicants (5-year average: 19). Trainee selection is a
holistic evaluation process that considers fairness and diversity, in addition to strength of the applicant.
 This PSTP aims to be a highly effective mechanism for interdisciplinary training in the Pharmacological
Sciences regardless of departmental affiliation. Even after financial support ends, trainees remain actively
engaged in the PSTP through and past graduation. Our core course sequence, Principles of Pharmacology and
Pharmacogenetics & Pharmacogenomics, provides trainees a deep understanding of classical and modern
pharmacology. Additional courses are required, such as Advanced Problem Solving in Pharmacological
Sciences, in which trainees work as a team to design collaborative research plans, while Basic Biostatistics and
Experimental Design, and Mastering Reproducible Science focus on rigor and reproducibility, a theme threaded
throughout all activities of the PSTP. Science Communication in the Digital Age and PSTP-organized career
workshops are offerings that broaden the development of career skills to better prepare our trainees for the job
market. These courses lead to cohort-building for our trainees from different programs, as they progress through
classes and program activities together including research retreats, summer brown bag discussion luncheons,
as well as semi- weekly interactions during Pharmacology Seminar."

 Mutations in the TULP1 gene underlie a severe, early-onset form of autosomal recessive retinitis
pigmentosa (RP). Our long-term objectives are to understand the cellular function of TULP1 and the
pathogenic mechanism responsible for retinal degeneration. TULP1 is a photoreceptor-specific protein
involved in vesicular trafficking in two photoreceptor compartments. In tulp1-/- mice, several phototransduction
proteins are mislocalized, indicating that TULP1 is necessary for protein transport to the outer segment (OS).
These mice also have a synaptic malformation with few intact ribbons, indicating a defect in neurotransmitter
vesicular cycling. Our preliminary data indicates that TULP1 has two distinct interactomes. We postulate that
TULP1 functions as an adapter protein linking OS-bound protein transport vesicles to the axoneme of the
transition zone and neurotransmitter-filled vesicles to the ribbon complex. Preliminary studies done in vitro
suggest that mutant TULP1 proteins cause ER stress and leads to induction of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) pathway, suggesting a possible mechanism for cell death. Our overall hypothesis is that TULP1 is a
phospholipid-sensing adapter protein required for the vesicular transport of proteins and that mutant
forms of TULP1 cause protein mistrafficking which induces chronic ER stress leading to photoreceptor
cell death through overload of protein degradation pathways. Experiments in Aim 1 will identify TULP1
compartment-specific protein-protein interactions and whether these interacting networks are disrupted by RP-
associated TULP1 mutations. This will be accomplished by performing immunoprecipitations, localization
experiments, high-resolution imaging, proximity proteomics and quantitative cross-linking mass spectroscopy
methods. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine the molecular signatures, temporal contributions and
mechanism of stress response pathway(s) activation throughout disease progression in Tulp1 mutant models
of RP by analyzing molecular markers unique to each pathway. For these experiments, we generated two
novel knock-in mouse lines each expressing an RP-associated TULP1 missense mutation. WT, tulp1-/-,
tulp1D94Y and tulp1F491L mice will be crossed with three different mouse lines each expressing an in vivo reporter
gene relevant to UPR, proteasome activity, or autophagy. Comprehensive phenotypic analyses will be
performed and compared across mice to determine in vivo whether mutant Tulp1 proteins induce chronic ER
stress leading to activation of stress response pathways causing cell death by overwhelming the
photoreceptors proteostasis network capacity. By clarifying the proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, this
project will significantly impact an important aspect of photoreceptor biology relevant to human retinal function
and disease. Importantly, determining the pathogenic mechanism behind TULP1-associated RP and identifying
the activated pathways will aid in discovering therapeutic targets aimed at slowing this blinding condition."
10862603,"Project Summary / Abstract
Postnatal growth failure remains a significant morbidity in very low birth weight infants despite aggressive and
modern parenteral and enteral nutrition practices. Compelling associations have been identified between in-
hospital growth failure and cardiometabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders, heightening the need to further
identify optimal nutritional needs of preterm infants. Studies in animals and humans demonstrate deficiencies in
sodium (Na) supply or intake impair somatic growth. Very low birth weight infants (i) are at increased risk of Na
depletion due to high (and often unappreciated) urine Na loss, (ii) lack osmotically-inactive Na pools that are
normally accrued during late gestation and are likely mobilized after birth to maintain circulating Na pools, and
(iii) demonstrate improved somatic growth when supplied with Na in amounts above that typically provided in
clinical practice. Our objective is to utilize novel animal models and laboratory methodologies to address the
critical lack of understanding of the links between Na homeostasis in early life and metabolic control. The PIs
have generated a wealth of published and preliminary data supporting their hypothesis that insufficient Na in
early life causes programmed changes in short-and long-term energy expenditure via activation of AT1AR/Gαi
signaling in selected hypothalamic neurons. We will address this hypothesis using several new mouse models
to (i) identify the role that osmotically-inactive Na pools and the brain RAS play in metabolic dysfunctions
programmed by Na depletion in early life (Aim 1), and (ii) explore the role of AT1AR signaling within Agouti-related
peptide (AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in mediating increased energy expenditure &
subsequent growth restriction in mice with Na depletion in early life (Aim 2). We have assembled a research
team with extensive experience with cutting-edge metabolic phenotyping, molecular biology and transgenic
animal production that is uniquely poised to address this clinically relevant issue. Findings from these studies
will greatly increase our mechanistic understanding of the role and importance of early-life Na homeostasis in
growth, metabolism and energy flux and potentially result in paradigm-shifting clinical practices which address
providing sufficient dietary Na to premature infants to optimize a spectrum of long-term outcomes."

Drosophila can be used to discover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which metformin
effects lifespan. From 112 tested cohorts, we found metformin can extend fly lifespan as much
as 30% but in other conditions the compound equally reduced lifespan. Here we propose to
identify genetic factors that contribute to this variation. We will conduct a genome wide
association (GWA) analysis with Drosophila, combined with emerging bioinformatic analytics
and molecular validation studies. We propose as well, an innovative approach to bridge
Drosophila analysis to humans and mice by mapping response SNPs of the fly onto orthologous
gene expression data from mammals. We will combine these approaches to resolve how
metformin affects aging, and through which pathways it positively or negatively modulates
lifespan."

10830906,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation has historically focused on outpatient data from
whites according to age, sex, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), diabetes,
smoking, and blood pressure (BP) information. Risk factors (RFs) and overall CVD risk are
associated with genetic variations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and
phenotypes have largely been based on single RF measurements using a Framingham
approach. Previous research has focused on European Americans (EA), and generally has not
included Veterans. Little information on CVD risk factor genes is available for African
Americans (AA) or Hispanic Americans (HA), two population groups that are extremely
important in the VA. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort provides a unique opportunity
to study genes and CVD risk among these subgroups, using MVP questionnaire data, electronic
health record (EHR) information, and genetic data. We propose to address scientific gaps by
focusing on multiple ethnicities, rare variants, and antecedent RF levels using the MVP cohort.
In previous funding we created a virtual baseline exam for all MVP participants and we propose
to further curate that information, extend research into new heart disease RFs and conditions,
and use a longitudinal prospective study design. In addition to traditional CVD RFs such as
lipids, smoking, diabetes, and BP that are already under investigation by our MVP research
group, we propose to use GWAS to assess effects of genes on blood cell indices, inflammatory
conditions, valvular heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation. Our research
will assess gene-environment (diet quality, pharmacological treatment) effects, and will included
assessment of current and antecedent RF levels. Methods will include diet quality adjustments
using the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire performed at the MVP baseline visit. Other
methods will include pharmacologic treatment of CVD RFs to derive imputed untreated RF
levels, and antecedent quantitative CVD RFs measured at VA outpatient visits up to 14 years
before the MVP baseline visit when such data are available. We will perform common variant
association studies (CVAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS), testing for the
association of genetic variants to quantitative CVD risk for incidence and period prevalence of a)
coronary heart disease (CHD) [myocardial infarction (MI), coronary bypass grafting (CABG),
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] and b) atherothrombotic stroke, with comparison of
effects by race and ethnicity, and c) recurrent events following an initial MI or stroke. Summary
analyses will examine the multigenic association of CHD and stroke using the genetic risk score
(GRS) of validated CVD-associated SNPs within and across ethnicity. This project will provide
a platform for CVD incidence analyses for MVP participants across the VA in the future. The
proposed study findings will allow for the comparison of the impact of genetic variants on heart
disease RFs and atherosclerotic disease prevalence across AA, HA, and EA Veterans."

The majority of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is triggered by lower respiratory tract
infections, and more that 40% of children who die PARDS-related deaths are previously healthy, very young
children. The unique airway environment of each child contributes to the heterogeneity of PARDS, and this
lack of insight into how the airway environment influences immunity has resulted in no therapies that hasten
recovery from PARDS.
This proposal describes a five-year career development and research plan for Dr. Jocelyn Grunwell to gain
training and expertise in 1) advanced biostatistics and big data management, 2) sound design of clinical trials,
and 3) to generate new biological and mechanistic insights into PARDS triggered by acute lower respiratory
tract infections. The ultimate objective of this K23 proposal is to become an independently funded physician-
scientist focused on developing precision therapies for critically ill children with acute lung injury. With
additional training in clinical research methodology and advanced biostatistical methods, this K23 award will
investigate novel pathobiological mechanisms of importance to the onset and progression of PARDS and link
these biologic endotypes with clinical phenotypes to achieve the following aims: 1) determine the phenotype of
recruited airway neutrophils and response to secondary insult, 2) determine whether recruited airway
neutrophils suppress T cell function through an arginine depletion mechanism, and 3) determine whether
endotype-phenotype clusters predict clinical outcomes using latent class analysis.
Investigating heterogeneous biological mechanisms and linking them to clinical PARDS phenotypes will be
aided by a knowledgeable and experienced mentorship team led by Dr. Anne Fitzpatrick. Dr. Fitzpatrick is an
expert in biostatistical approaches to phenotype identification in heterogeneous pediatric disorders such as
asthma and in the analysis of high-dimensional patient data resulting from metabolomic and gene expression
studies. The mentorship team is complimented by Dr. Adrienne Randolph, a pediatric intensivist with an
interest in influenza induced lung injury, complex analyses of the airway cytokine environment, and functional
assays of the innate immune response to stimulus by viral and bacterial mimetics. The mentorship team and
institutional environment are ideal to foster career development and collaboration related to pediatric acute
lung injury and sequelae of critical illness.
Dr. Grunwell has had outstanding foundation in molecular methods, having earned a PhD and a Damon-
Runyon Postdoctoral fellowship in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco,
respectively. At the completion of this K23, Dr. Grunwell will be an expert in identifying endotype-phenotype
associations of complex critical illness syndromes using advanced biostatistical methods who will then use her
molecular training to hone in on novel biological mechanisms to bring precision medicine to critically ill children."

Large degree of interindividual variability in drug response frequently compromises drug safety and
efficacy. The long-term goal of my research is a mechanistic and clinical understanding of this variability and
then personalized drug therapy. My research, funded mainly by NIGMS, has focused on the changes in drug
pharmacokinetics due to both 1) inherited differences in drug disposition and 2) unpredictable drug-drug
interactions (DDIs). This work produced new and novel mechanisms of drug disposition and identified genetic
and DDI factors responsible for interindividual variability in drug and/or active metabolite exposure and effects.
Novel in vitro and clinical phenotyping tools, genomic biomarkers and LC/MS/MS methods were developed
that significantly advanced the science of drug disposition and stimulated collaborative and worldwide research
endeavors. Examples include revision of the FDA package insert for efavirenz, development of dosing
guidelines and position papers on efavirenz and CYP2B6, and the use of efavirenz as in vitro and in vivo probe
of CYP2B6 activity. Yet, incomplete understanding of the mechanisms for interindividual variability in drug
disposition persists for many other clinically important drugs and continues to compromise the implementation
of maximum drug efficacy with minimal toxicity. This knowledge gap is the focus of this MIRA application.
1) The combined effect of genetic variability in drug disposition and DDIs on drug exposure and effect has
rarely been studied. Efavirenz (a CYP2B6 substrate and a critical drug for the treatment of HIV) induces
hepatic CYP2B6 and inhibits hepatic CYP1A2 in CYP2B6 genotype-dependent fashion. We hypothesize
that interplay of genetic variations and DDIs is a key driver of intersubject differences in drug disposition and
effect. In healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2B6 variants, the stereoselective disposition and effect (e.g.,
pupil diameter) of methadone (a CYP2B6 substrate) and the disposition and effect (systolic and diastolic blood
pressures) of tizanidine (a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate) will be determined at baseline and after pretreatment
with efavirenz (600 mg/day PO for 17 days). 2) UGTs are differentially expressed in extrahepatic tissues, but
their role in in drug metabolism is incompletely understood. Building on our recent publication with dolutegravir
(a UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 substrate), we will test the hypothesis that modulation of extrahepatic metabolism of
UGT substrates contributes to the variability in exposure of UGT substrates. In-depth in vitro kinetic and
inhibition studies will be performed in microsomes derived from UGT genotyped human hepatic, intestinal and
kidney tissues. 3) Some clinically observed complex DDIs are unpredictable based on current knowledge.
Capitalizing on our work with bupropion-CYP2D6 interaction, in vitro DDI studies are proposed to identify the
mechanistic basis of clinically observed DDIs, focusing on circulating metabolites/stereoisomers and less well-
understood metabolic pathways. Appropriate in silico approaches will complement our studies. The results will
enhance our ability to personalize drug therapy."

 The New York University Grossman School of Medicine (NYU SoM) and its collaborating partners propose
to evolve and disseminate the impact of a program that fosters substance use disorder (SUD) research training
for trainees in the fields of medicine, nursing, dentistry, social work and public health. The purpose of this
program, currently in its fifteenth year, is to stimulate participants’ interest in pursuing careers in SUD research.
Using an interactive web-based educational design, we have developed a flexible and content-rich Substance
Abuse Research Education and Training (SARET) program to educate medical, nursing, dental, social work
and public health students about addiction and the fundamentals of clinical research. A subset of learners,
often motivated by participation in this curriculum, participate in a summer-long program centered on an
intensive SUD-related research experience with a seasoned mentor, aimed at stimulating enduring interest in
this field. The SARET program is an interprofessional collaboration between the NYU Grossman School of
Medicine, NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing, NYU College of Dentistry, NYU Silver School of Social Work
and NYU School of Global Public Health. Our collaboration has built successfully on our extensive experience
in developing and evaluating innovative approaches to health professional education and in substance use-
related research and training. Working closely with our research, education and clinical partners (including a
NIDA CTN node and Bellevue Hospital Center), we have developed, implemented and evaluated this
innovative and engaging educational platform, integrating it into our participating schools’ curricula (with over
22,000 module completions at NYU schools to date) and creating rich and intensive individual mentored
research experiences for over 110 participants. Our evaluation data suggest substantive positive impact on
attitudes towards substance abuse research, and significant influence on subsequent research engagement
among those who participated in mentored summer research placements. By continually refreshing the
content of the SARET curriculum, and making it exportable to other health professional schools and training
programs, we have facilitated its dissemination to learners around the country, and a new component of
SARET in which we support visiting faculty mentors from other schools in developing programs of mentored
SUD research at their home institutions is further advancing the program’s spread. We are now poised to
enter the fourth “phase” of the SARET initiative – in which we will deepen its focus on themes of health equity
and racial justice, and further increase its impact by seeding the initiation of similar programs at other health
professional training programs nationally. Overall, our goal is to increase the number of physicians, nurses,
dentists, social workers and public health practitioners who, stimulated by their participation in this initiative, will
follow career paths that advance clinically-oriented research addressing substance use disorders."
10831044,"The increasing recognition of RNA’s importance provides strong motivation for understanding
how its dynamic structures contribute to biology at the molecular scale. Much of RNA’s versatility
is derived from its intrinsic conformational flexibility and capacity to interact with a broad range of
cellular partners. Assessment of RNA’s structures is challenged by the variations that supports
these multiple roles. This program supports the continued application of tightly coupled
experimental and computational tools to characterize ensembles of RNA structures. Recent
advances enhance the resolution or interpretation of solution-based measurements, revealing
subtle but important changes in rigid elements, like duplexes, or the full range of structures
assumed by highly flexible unpaired strands. This project now extends studies of RNA from
isolated motifs to biologically functional elements and aims to resolve their atomically detailed
workings. A distinct focus is on the structural variation of single-stranded motifs. The capture or
release of these highly flexible regions is a potent signal exploited in regulating the translation of
mRNAs into proteins, via interactions with ions, small ligands or RNA motifs such as duplexes or
loops in helix-junction-helix motifs. Because of their importance in controlling gene expression,
these motifs offer new targets for therapeutic intervention or strategies for stabilizing existing
RNA-based drugs or vaccines. Finally, this project will continue successful efforts to characterize
the interaction of flexible nucleic acid motifs with proteins, laying the groundwork for
understanding how large nucleic acid-protein complexes function."
10852820,"Abrupt menopause induction together with anti-estrogen therapy improves recurrence-free
survival in breast cancer and is a new standard of care for premenopausal women with hormone
receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. This near-complete estrogen deprivation (NCED) therapy
also places these women at risk of organ compromise associated with early hypoestrogenemia.
Early hypoestrogenemia in women with non-cancerous reasons for premature menopause is
associated with significant cardiovascular (CV) compromise including atherosclerosis and
coronary artery disease, which can be detected preclinically by myocardial perfusion imaging and
computed tomography angiography. Less is known about how NCED therapy will impact CV
health in the tens of thousands of premenopausal women diagnosed with HR-positive breast
cancer each year who will see NCED therapy. It is critical to understand the early natural history
of this risk because clinical CV disease related to hypoestrogenemia will not be reversible. Given
the prevalence of HR-positive breast cancer and marked improvements in survival following
breast cancer, long-term CV sequalae from cancer treatments have the potential to both impact
large numbers of women and offset these survival gains. We will study the early impact of NCED
on the CV system to identify pre-clinical markers of myocardial compromise. The CV health of
women initiating NCED will be assessed by comprehensive, quantitative serial cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging stress studies over a two-year period to document changes in flow of both
small and large CV vessels as well as overall left ventricular structure and function.
We will test the overarching hypothesis that premenopausal women receiving NCED for HR-
positive breast cancer have CV declines that can be identified preclinically using the following
aims: Characterize and quantify the extent of microvascular injury and perfusion changes
experienced during early NCED therapy; Characterize and quantify the extent structural and
functional alterations to the aorta and left ventricle while on NCED therapy; Identify potential
biomarkers and additional risk factors for CV decline in patients receiving NCED. The knowledge
derived from these aims will provide an understanding of which patients are at risk of CV
compromise from NCED. These studies will further enable development of standard of care
predictive tools to assess CV decline in women on NCED before it is clinically apparent with the
goal of allowing women to safely remain on anti-neoplastic regimens and thereby lower both the
burdens of cancer and cardiovascular treatment-related toxicity."

 Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging, DMI, has demonstrated ability to identify changes in brain
metabolism associated with cancer. However, downstream products of glucose metabolism,
glutamate/glutamine (glx) and lactate, have intrinsically low signal to noise ratios that make detection
challenging. This work posits that imaging of HDO following metabolism of [2H7]glucose will produce a more
sensitive means of detecting glycolysis and glucose oxidation in the Krebs cycle. Towards this end we will
establish optimal dosing levels of substrate as well as the impact of insulin sensitivity on cerebral metabolism
of the glucose substrate. The high signal to noise of the HDO peak allows simple gradient echo methods to be
used for detection, facilitating higher spatial resolution in the images. After injection of [2H7]glucose in vivo, a
~15 minute window exists where HDO appearance matches the generation of deuterated glx almost exactly,
indicating the HDO can serve as a surrogate of oxidative flux in the brain. To take full advantage of this
window, we will develop compressed sensing methods for accelerating acquisition of the 2H images. HDO is
freely diffusible, and at long times we believe excess HDO appearance in the brain is related to vascular HDO
generated by peripheral metabolism. We will use diffusion weighted imaging to test the hypothesis that
suppression of the vascular HDO signal will render the remaining HDO component a faithful reporter of
cerebral glucose metabolism. We will compare our new methods to 8F-deoxyglucose - positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET) to determine if the two techniques provide complementary information about
metabolism in animal models of brain cancer. The overall goal in this proposal is to establish HDO imaging as
a robust marker of cerebral glucose metabolism.
Relevance
 Metabolic imaging of the brain is of general interest across all of neuroscience, from basic biochemistry, to
cognition science, to the study of pathophysiologies, and in the clinical diagnoses of multiple brain related
diseases. The primary method currently used for metabolic brain imaging is FDG-PET, which cannot be used
for longitudinal studies or in the pediatric population due to guidelines for total radiation exposure.
Development of a magnetic resonance based method, which is safe for repeated use, would significantly
enhance our ability to study brain function across all of neuroscience. The basic research described in this
proposal will improve the robustness of a new method for detecting brain metabolism based on the detection of
HDO following metabolism of a perdeuterated glucose tracer. Glucose is the primary substrate used for energy
production in the brain, and is therefore the most appropriate substrate for development in this context."

Emerging evidence indicates that many aspects of ethanol (EtOH) and drug dependence involve
changes in glutamate transmission in central reward brain regions, including the nucleus
accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. Upregulation of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in these
brain regions with i.p. injections of several β-lactams, including ceftriaxone, attenuated EtOH intake
and EtOH relapse behaviors in alcohol-preferring rats (P rats). GLT-1 is responsible for the uptake
of the majority of extracellular glutamate. In addition, cystine/glutamate exchanger (xCT) is another
astroglial protein involved in regulating glutamate homeostasis. The premise of this work is to
pursue a very extensive preclinical study that will investigate the neuropharmacology of novel GLT-
1 upregulators, MC-100093, and derivatives as well as a non-antibiotic FDA-approved β-lactam,
clavulanic acid (CLAV), which is a β-lactamase inhibitor in both continuous EtOH intake and EtOH
relapse behavior. In this study, we will investigate novel -lactams (MC-100093 and derivatives),
which do not have antibiotic action, on the expression of GLT-1 and xCT, and anti-inflammatory
effects. The experimental goals are: (Aim 1) Investigate the pharmacokinetics.pharmacodynamics
and target engagement of MC-100093 and, its derivatives and CLAV to determine dosing, and
nominate efficacy biomarkers for subsequent use in P rats; (Aim 2) Investigate the
pharmacological mechanisms of action of MC-100093 and its derivatives, and CLAV involving the
upregulation of GLT-1 and xCT, and attenuation of neuroinflammation in P rats. Data generated
from this project will show that novel drugs can upregulate GLT-1 expression and could have
significant clinical implications for alcohol dependence and other neuropsychiatric disorders
characterized by the hyperglutamatergic state as well as modulating neuroinflammation associated
with an increase in extracellular glutamate in central brain regions that regulate drug dependence;
and (Aim 3) to identify optimized, more lipophilic analogs of MC-100093 with drug-like properties
and pharmacokinetic profiles that support once-dosing."

Project Summary
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) survival has increased substantially over the past three decades,
rendering mortality alone an insufficient metric for pediatric critical illness outcomes assessment. Currently,
a comprehensive understanding of PICU morbidity and the trajectory of recovery among PICU survivors and
their families is limited. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) consists of new or worsening impairments in
physical, cognitive, or mental health status that arise and may persist after critical illness. The
characteristics of PICS in children (PICS-p) are unknown. At this time, we cannot identify modifiable risk
factors for poor PICU outcomes and/or develop systematic, timely, and targeted PICU or post-PICU
interventions to improve PICU morbidity without first understanding the recovery in children who commonly
share the PICU experience.
Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal cohort study of patients undergoing >3 days of ICU therapies
(case) at one of 20 US PICUs to evaluate child and family outcomes over two years. We will compare
outcomes of these PICU patients with a control group of patients who received an overnight (control) PICU
stay who did not receive intensive care unit therapies as well as with published quality of life data from the
general and chronically ill populations. Children and their families will be enrolled locally from each PICU,
and their outcomes will be followed centrally from the University of Pennsylvania and Seattle Children’s
Research Institute. Our specific aims are (1) to determine the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social
health outcomes and trajectory of recovery in a population of children post-critical illness; (2) to determine
the baseline health, presenting problem, and PICU factors associated with impaired physical, cognitive,
emotional, and social outcomes among PICU survivors, and (3) to determine the emotional and social
health outcomes in parents and siblings of PICU survivors. Our primary goal is to explicate the impact of
pediatric critical illness over a two-year period of time to guide future intervention research to optimize child
and family outcomes. Our overall goal is to improve the health and well-being of PICU survivors and their
families.

Background: One million children develop tuberculosis (TB) each year and a quarter of these die. TB meningitis
(TBM) is the most severe form of TB disease and even if diagnosed and treated, 20% die and over 50% of
survivors are left with permanent neurological disability. Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with TBM
is due to infarction caused by large and small vessel inflammation and thrombosis. Despite this, our
understanding of the pathogenesis of infarction in TBM is limited, especially in children. We hypothesize that
imbalance of the endothelial and plasma pro- and anti-thrombotic mechanisms, inflammatory pathways and
vascular proliferative processes underlies cerebral infarction in TBM. Our group has an extensive track record
of clinical research into children with TBM and the research team consists of world leaders in the fields of clinical
epidemiology, proteomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, neurosciences, and radiology.
Methods: We will recruit 80 children with probable or confirmed TBM over 30 months and obtain samples of
blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). All children will undergo MRI and FDG PET/CT at baseline and at 2 weeks
they will have repeat MRI with further blood and CSF samples collected. MRI will then be carried out at 24 weeks
will neurodevelopmental assessment at 48 weeks. The neuroimaging will quantify differences between children
with and without infarction and relate imaging to clinical presentation and outcome. It will also identify penumbral
regions indicating future infarct development/evolution. We will enrich the laboratory analyses with samples from
50 children with probable or confirmed TBM, recruited between 2016 and 2020. RNA sequencing of blood and
CSF will be used to identify differentially expressed genes and identify implicated biological pathways between
children with and without infarction and between samples taken at baseline and at 2 weeks. Targeted
immunoassays and discovery mass spectrometry will be performed on plasma and CSF to determine differences
in protein abundance, with a focus on proteins involved in coagulation and endothelial function. Finally, we will
integrate the transcriptomics, proteomics and radiomics to generate a comprehensive understanding of the
pathogenesis of infarction in children with TBM. We aim to group children into several biological/anatomical
phenotypes, each of which may benefit from a different therapeutic approach. We will then explore, using
computer simulation, the impact of therapeutic interventions on biological pathways in each phenotype. We
anticipate that this work could pave the way for the development of point-of-care tests that could stratify therapy
at the time of diagnosis.
Impact: A more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of infarction in children with TBM would
permit targeted host-directed therapies, with the potential to moderate or eliminate the consequences of this
devastating condition."

In its most basic form, this proposal will explore the effects of human disease through the use of
a fly model to generate fly avatars of severe epileptic disease. The form of epilepsy that will be
modeled here is Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE)—a pediatric epileptic
condition that causes severe early onset epilepsy. By making mutations, the goal is to generate
a fly model and use it to generate insights into epileptic mechanisms. Then, with the
construction of CRISPR generated platform for recombinase generated mosaics, mosaics can
be generated for the DEE mutants that explore tissue sensitivities. The long-term goal is to
improve the understanding of these epilepsies and what increases or decreases their
occurrences. Using the recombinase-based mosaicism, there exists a real possibility to delve
into the cell biology of the molecules that predispose an organism to epileptic seizures. The
ultimate goal is to understand these specific epilepsies, what promotes them and how can
tailored therapies be generated from a better understanding of their mechanisms. The hope is
that ultimately these discoveries lead to a targeted drug therapy."
10850193,"Comprehensive understanding about the binding of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR-α) to inverse
agonists with the first-principles based theoretical methods
ERR is one of three estrogen-related receptors (ERRs: ERR,- and -) that act as ligand-dependent transcription factors
and share common target genes. Substantial expression of ERR was found in a few types of breast cancers, and ERR
has thus been identified as a new target for breast cancer therapy. Breast cancers have become the most common
cancers diagnosed in the United States and one of the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Therefore, it is urgent to
develop targeted therapy approaches for breast cancer treatment. A few classes of ERR inverse agonists were reported to
inhibit tumor development and progression by disrupting the interaction of ERR with their coactivators (PGC-1 and
PGC-1). The crystal structure for the complex ERR and an inverse agonist compound 1 (1-p-tolyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl-
amine, the most studied inverse agonist) reveals the conformation change as compared with active apo-ERR in the absence
of compound 1, and illustrates the major residues in the ligand binding pocket (LBP). However, the quantitative binding
affinities for the key residues with the inverse agonist are unknown, and the binding free energy for ERR/compound 1
predicted by previous theoretical methods is far from the experimental one. Although the inverse agonist
(thiadiazoleacrylamide, XCT790) and a few others also show strong inhibitory effects on the transcriptional activity of
ERR, the crystal structures for the complexes of these inverse agonists with ERRα are still unavailable, which considerably
limits an understanding about the mechanism by which these inverse agonists bind to ERRα, and inhibit the coactivation of
ERRα and PGC-1.
 Overall, the binding mechanism of ERR to the potential inverse agonists has not been well understood in terms
of binding modes and thermodynamics, and the hot spot residues that play an important role in the binding have not been
well defined. On the basis of our preliminary study we hypothesized that a) a potential inverse agonist needs to strongly
interact with the residues of H3, H5, H6/H7 loop, and H11 helix in the ligand binding domain (LBD) through hydrophobic
and hydrogen bonding. b) it is essential for an effective inverse agonist to strongly bind with the aromatic ring cluster
consisting of Phe328(H3), Phe495(H11), and Phe382(H5/H6 loop) as well as Leu500. The first-principles-based theoretical
methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding affinity calculations are able to provide meaningful
insights into the binding mechanism of ERR to the inverse agonists. Using large scale MD simulation with the updated
force fields and a robust binding free energy strategy, the major goal of the project therefore is to gain a comprehensive
understanding about the binding between ERR and a few inverse agonists in terms of binding modes and binding
thermodynamics. To test our hypothesis and gain a comprehensive understanding the specific aims are 1) Aim 1. To explore
the binding mode and binding free energy of ERRα to inverse agonists with the new force fields and more robust method,
alchemical binding free energy in AMBER22. Large scale MD trajectory will be used to analyze the binding modes with 3-
D PyMol and 2-D LigPlot visualization software, and to calculate binding affinity with MM/PB(GB)SA approaches. Besides
the standard MM/PB(GB)SA calculation for binding affinity, conformation change of unbound ligand and protein will be
taken into account through separate MD simulations. Before applying to other inverse agonists, the employed theoretical
methods and force fields will be carefully validated by comparing the theoretical results (binding modes, and binding free
affinity) with the available experimental data for the binding of ERRα and compound 1. 2) Aim 2. To provide more
accurate binding thermodynamics by developing a quantum mechanics based hierarchical approach and using Alchemical
binding free energy strategy Predicting protein-ligand binding affinities is a major objective of structure-based drug design.
In order to provide more accurate thermodynamics for the binding of ERR to the inverse agonists, a hierarchical approach
will be developed on the basis of the first-principles based theoretical methods such as dispersion-corrected density
functional theory (DFT-D) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) like 3-layer ONIOM scheme. DFT-D
and QM/MM will provide accurate binding affinity for ligand-residue pairs and ligand-protein, respectively. Accurate
binding thermodynamics are essential to identify the hot spot residues for the complexes of ERR/inverse agonists. 3)
Aim 3. To identify hot spot residues of ERR and the essential ( operational) groups of the inverse agonists The validated
theoretical methods will be extended to a few more systems such as ERRα/XCT790 and ERR α/compounds 3-4 including
large scale MD simulation and binding free energy calculation with new force fields. Accurate binding affinity per residue
basis from DFT-D and binding pocket analysis with AlphaSpace will help identify the hot spot residues. The relative binding
free affinities for different inverse agonists from Alchemical binding free energy (BFE) will be used to analyse the essential
(operational) groups of the inverse agonists, which play the predominant role in the binding of ERR with the inverse
agonists."

 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and psychosocial stress is a significant
predictor of disease incidence and severity. However, the specific neurobiological mechanisms that mediate
the cardiovascular consequences of stress are largely unknown. Therefore, the current proposal will determine
how the cortical circuits responsible for cognitive appraisal of stress regulate physiological stress responses.
Recent studies in rats identified a population of cells in the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex
that integrate endocrine and autonomic responses to stress in a sexually-divergent manner. Further,
stimulation of IL glutamate neurons and chronic stress interact sex-specifically to affect cardiac structure and
function. While the activity of excitatory IL projection neurons is critical for regulating the deleterious effects of
chronic stress, the pathways used by these cells to modulate reactivity of autonomic and endocrine systems
remain to be determined. Preliminary data indicate that IL projections to the posterior hypothalamus (PH)
reduce male stress responses but enhance female stress responses. These excitatory IL projections target
both inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the male and female PH. Further, chronic
variable stress upregulates PH gene expression related to glutamate and GABA signaling in males but not
females. Altogether, these findings led to the hypothesis that sex-specific IL glutamatergic signaling to the PH
differentially engages glutamatergic and GABAergic cells to regulate cardiovascular and endocrine stress
reactivity, as well as the consequences of chronic stress on vascular stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy. This
hypothesis will be tested in 3 aims. First, circuit signaling will be examined with patch-clamp slice
electrophysiology in male and female rats. Specific experiments will determine how IL glutamate signaling
targets genetically-defined postsynaptic PH GABAergic and glutamatergic cells as well as chronic stress-
induced circuit plasticity. Second, in vivo optogenetic activation of IL synapses in the PH following chronic
variable stress will interface with measures of heart rate, blood pressure, and neuroendocrine stress
responses. This approach will isolate circuit effects to normalize or exacerbate stress reactivity. Third, a
combinatorial viral approach will be used to retrogradely inhibit IL projections to the PH with Cre-dependent
tetanus toxin. In addition to cardiovascular telemetry and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormones, cardiac
hypertrophy and microvascular function will be assessed in chronically-stressed male and female rats to
determine circuit regulation of stress-induced cardiac and vascular dysfunction. Collectively, these experiments
will determine specific circuit and cellular pathways linking cognitive appraisal with physiological stress
responses. Further, this investigation is poised to not only increase understanding of brain-body interactions
and sex-based health disparities, but also identify potential targets to mitigate cardiovascular risk."
10840788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stroke gait deficits are complex and marked by adverse effects on kinematics, kinetics, gait symmetry, and inter-
and intra- limb joint coordination across different phases of the gait cycle. One intervention simply cannot target
the high inter-individual variability of deficits observed in post-stroke gait. Approximately 2/3 of stroke survivors
have persistent gait impairments despite being discharged from rehabilitation, and one reason could be the lack
of tailored rehabilitation approaches to address their individual-specific impairments. The development of tailored
rehabilitation approaches, however, is limited by the lack of robust metrics to identify and analyze individual-
specific differences in gait. The objective of this work is to develop a sensitive, data-driven, consistent
characterization of gait using continuous, multi-joint gait dynamics. The dynamics of gait will be extracted from
measured kinematics (joint angles) and used to develop individual-specific gait characterizations, which we
coined the ‘gait signature.’ We will use these gait signatures to probe the mechanisms underlying stroke gait
impairment using rehabilitation techniques, specifically Fast functional electrical stimulation (FastFES). FastFES
is a gait rehabilitation intervention that targets ankle dorsiflexor muscles to address foot drop, and ankle
plantarflexor muscles to improve ankle torque at push-off. The literature suggests that response to FastFES
depends on the precise alignment between a specific muscle coordination deficit and the gait rehabilitation
modality. This suggests that knowledge of an individual’s specific gait impairment before rehabilitation can
predict their response to therapy. Since FastFES is known to target ankle deficits related to ankle push-off, I will
probe this theory and evaluate whether gait signatures can encode ankle push-off corrections in response to a
single session exposure to FastFES. I predict that stroke individuals with ankle-related push-off deficits will show
the greatest response or change in their gait signature towards normative (able-bodied) gait. Preliminary findings
show that gait signatures accurately discriminate between different stroke individuals. A noteworthy finding is
that our gait signatures do not appear to cluster according to walking speed, leading to our hypothesis that gait
signatures distinguish individual-specific differences in stroke gait corresponding to what we know about
heterogeneity in stroke gait impairments. We aim to determine the functional biomechanical relevance of various
clusters of gait signatures, and we will determine whether FastFES targets a specific cluster of individuals
depending on the biomechanical features, characteristics, or deficits that they have. Furthermore, we will
determine whether gait signatures before FastFES exposure can predict whether stroke-survivor will be a
potential responder to FastFES. If successful, gait signatures will prove to be a robust marker of specific gait
impairments and have important implications for the development of future tailored rehabilitation strategies for
stroke survivors."

New urgency has been added to the ability to precisely diagnose inherited spastic paraplegia (HSP) patients by
the advent of gene targeting therapies in motoneuron disorders. Similar to other rare diseases, exome
sequencing in our highly select HSP sample resolves only ~30% of families. We hypothesize that many of the
missing disease-causing alleles are in fact not accessible to whole exome studies (WES). Whole genome
sequencing (WGS) has become affordable and will be required to expand current knowledge. We have made
significant progress in the past nine years in applying the WES paradigm and published findings on novel genes
and pathways, relatively common deep intronic changes, gene/pseudogene complications for bioinformatics,
uniparental disomy, and extensive phenotype/genotype correlations [1-7]. We have aggregated the probably
largest set of HSP exomes (1,461 + 3,500 related phenotypes), created a network of collaborating scientists,
engaged patient advocacy groups, and performed preclinical studies in preparation of clinical trials. This
competitive renewal application will build further on these resources and prepare the stage for therapies. We
propose a systematic expansion of our sample, clinical data collection, and state of the art sophisticated WGS-
based studies to identify additional alleles and genes in HSP patients. The latter are based on our in-house
developed GENESIS phenotype/genome analysis software that holds exome and genome data on 12,403 well-
defined patients with rare neurological diseases. Standardized clinical classification using open human
phenotype ontologies (HPO) allows for real-time genotype/phenotype data mining and gene matching in a
collaborative fashion. We also propose an integrated genetic modifier study in the most common form of HSP,
SPG4. The latter benefits from our recent success in this area [8] and has the potential to uncover alternative
targets to rescue SPG4 phenotypic features. All new genes will be followed up with functional experiments for
an additional layer of confirmation. This study will result in significant progress towards closing the diagnostic
gap and identifying new and innovative therapeutic targets."
10840790,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Small RNAs – short, noncoding RNAs – are critical regulators in animal physiology and disease that silence
gene expression by complementary base pairing interactions to control mRNA stability/translation and epigenetic
modifications. Small RNA-mediated silencing pathways are evolutionarily conserved, and the largest class of
small RNAs comprise Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Extensive studies in fly established that piRNAs silence
transposons and are expressed in a sex-specific manner; piRNAs are essential for genome integrity and
germline development. However, most piRNAs in mammals and worm do not map to transposons, and instead
are predicted to regulate germline-expressed genes. Although novel associations of individual piRNAs with
endogenous genes have been reported, endogenous gene targets of piRNAs remain largely unknown.
 In C. elegans, each of the ~15,000 piRNAs is autonomously transcribed and contains an upstream cis-
regulatory element, the Ruby motif. We found piRNAs are differentially expressed during spermatogenesis and
oogenesis, and male piRNAs have a strong bias for the 5’C nucleotide in the Ruby motif. Furthermore, we
identified SNPC-1.3 as a sex-specific transcription factor critical for male fertility. SNPC-1.3 depends on a known
core piRNA biogenesis factor, SNPC-4, to drive male piRNA expression during spermatogenesis. Loss of snpc-
1.3 during spermatogenesis results in global depletion of male piRNAs and sperm maturation defects. Other
piRNA biogenesis factors have been identified, but how these trans-acting factors interact with each other and
the Ruby motif is poorly understood.
 In this proposed research, I hypothesize that sex-specific regulatory mechanisms underlie piRNA
expression to regulate endogenous genes critical for proper germline development. To test my hypothesis in the
context of spermatogenesis, in Aim 1 I will use a recently developed strategy Cleavage Under Targets and
Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) to characterize protein-DNA binding profiles of 5 piRNA biogenesis trans-
acting factors at the Ruby motif cis-regulatory element. Furthermore, I will determine if the 5’ C nucleotide in the
Ruby motif acts as a male specific element for SNPC-1.3. I will also use computational tools to identify putative,
novel cis-regulatory elements for male and female piRNAs. In Aim 2, I will computationally identify endogenous
gene targets of male piRNAs from small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq in wild-type and snpc-1.3(-) animals as well
as piRTarBase, a database of computationally predicted and experimentally identified piRNA targeting sites. I
will experimentally validate male piRNAs and their predicted endogenous gene targets using reporter assays for
endogenous and synthetic piRNAs and applying CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of piRNAs or their
targets. Collectively, this research will strengthen our understanding of how sex-specific piRNA expression is
transcriptionally regulated and provide new insights into biological roles of piRNAs beyond transposon silencing."
10840857,"The mechanisms that synchronize hormone secretion across millions of islets of Langerhans in the pancreas
are unknown. The long-term goal of the Roper laboratory is to decode cellular communication to enable
understanding of normal biological function and disease progression. The objective of this proposal is to identify
the mechanisms that generate synchronized rapid and ultradian insulin and glucagon oscillations from multiple
islets. The central hypothesis is that multiple mechanisms working in concert produce both rapid and ultradian
oscillations of hormone release. The rationale for performing this work is that a thorough understanding of the
dynamics of glucose-regulatory hormone secretion will lead to the design of therapeutic approaches that alleviate
the complications associated with diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Guided by strong preliminary data,
this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of time delays and dual
entrainment on insulin synchronization, and 2) identify glucagon secretion and synchronization dynamics. Under
the first aim, two methods for inducing islet synchronization will be used together, one a negative insulin/glucose
feedback loop with time delays, and the other, pulsatile activation of M3 receptors. To accomplish this aim, a
high-speed method for insulin measurement will be developed using droplet microfluidics and will be used for
testing a range of time delays and the ability to perfuse multiple secretagogues in parallel. In the second aim,
glucagon secretion will be measured for the first time from single islets of Langerhans using a homogeneous
time resolved fluorescence assay using a microfluidic system. With this method, we anticipate observing single
islet glucagon secretion dynamics and will parallelize the method to discern how glucagon pulses are
synchronized across multiple islets. The proposed research is innovative because the microfluidic systems and
measurement approaches developed in this proposal will allow rapid and ultradian oscillations of islet secretion
to be observed for the first time. These results will provide a significant increase in the knowledge of islet
regulation, which is crucial for fully understanding the mechanism of glucose homeostasis and how it goes awry
in metabolic diseases. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to guide therapeutic development for reducing
the problems associated with unregulated glucose levels in type II diabetes."

Ischemia is a major cause of human acute kidney injury (AKI), a common condition in hospitalized patients with high morbidity and mortality. In ischemic AKI, hypoxic adaptation is mediated by Hypoxia-Inducible-Factors (HIF), transcriptional factors whose activity is negatively regulated by prolyl-hydroxylase domain proteins 1 to 3 (PHD1 to PHD3). HIF activation by pharmacologic PHD inhibition prior to renal IRI attenuates postischemic kidney injury and inflammation. The shift of cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis has emerged as a critical factor by which PHD/HIF signaling promotes resilience to ischemia. Despite this fundamental concept, the mechanisms by which HIF affects different metabolic pathways beyond glycolysis remain unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand how hypoxic metabolic adaptation affects postischemic renal injury and repair. We recently discovered a non-canonical role for HIF signaling on tryptophan metabolism, a pathway that generates several bioactive metabolites with profound protective effects on tissues. Among them, kynurenine and kynurenic acid have emerged as metabolites that exert cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions but their role in AKI remains unclear. The objective of this proposal is to understand how alterations in tryptophan metabolism induced by HIF-2 affect postischemic renal injury and repair. The central hypothesis is that HIF-2 activation protects against postischemic renal injury and promotes repair through alterations in tryptophan derived metabolites kynurenine and kynurenic acid. Our rationale is that identification of the mechanism by which HIF-2 induced alterations in tryptophan metabolism provide renoprotection will create urgently needed new targeted therapeutic opportunities in the field of AKI. Our specific aim will test the following hypothesis: Activation of HIF-2 protects against AKI and promotes repair by increasing kynurenine levels systemically and in the kidney tissue in either Slc7a5- or IDO1-dependent manner. Completion of this aim will define a new paradigm in postischemic kidney injury and repair by HIF-2 activation through tryptophan metabolism and will stimulate new areas for experimental therapeutics in AKI. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate the role of hypoxic signaling in tryptophan metabolism in the context of ischemic AKI, an unexplored metabolic axis with exciting translational applications"
10840838,"The overall goal of our research program is to understand the intricate mechanisms by which neurons
establish the precise spatial and patterns of protein synthesis needed for synaptic plasticity and circuit
formation. Much of this regulation occurs at the RNA level, and my laboratory focuses on uncovering novel
regulatory mechanisms that enable this RNA-based control. Our research centers around three programs: (1)
Epitranscriptomic regulation of neuronal mRNAs. We are often credited with helping to start a new field of
RNA biology termed “epitranscriptomics,” the idea that mRNA fate and function is encoded in the RNA by
regulatory nucleotide modifications. A major program in my lab focuses on epitranscriptomic regulation of
mRNA fate in neurons by these modifications. (2) Deciphering the mechanism of RNA-directed epigenetic
silencing in fragile X syndrome. We recently showed that fragile X syndrome is a disease caused by CGG
repeat RNA. We found that this RNA forms a hybrid with complementary DNA to induce the epigenetic
silencing, which constitutes a new epigenetic pathway. We are committed to understanding this new area of
epigenetics and using knowledge of this pathway to develop a completely new approach to treat this major
neurological condition. (3) Technologies for revealing the function of the synaptic transcriptome. In
order to reveal new insights into RNA regulation in the brain, we develop novel technologies to enable imaging
and analysis of mRNA, perhaps most notably “RNA mimics of GFP,” including Spinach. We will take these
fluorogenic aptamers to the next level of brightness needed for the demanding imaging approaches used in live
functioning animals. Additionally, we will be developing new engineered aptamers that enable light-control of
synaptic mRNA translation. Overall, this research program will advance our understanding of post-

 The materno-fetal interface is a crucial environment for a healthy fetal development during pregnancy
and delivery. A decrease in maternal trophic factors, such as maternal thyroid hormones or a maternal
inflammation/maternal immune activation (MIA) have been linked to an increased risk for neurodevelopmental
disorders, such as autism or preterm births. However, there has been no study to date to directly evaluate their
impact on human developing brain. To fill this gap of knowledge, we propose to experimentally study the
consequences of inflammatory factors on human neurodevelopment using the cerebral organoids co-cultured
with microglial cells, a 3D model that mimics the early stages of the human brain development. Microglial cells
are immune cells of the central nervous system that are generated in the yolk sac and penetrating the brain
parenchyma during a critical time of the embryogenesis coinciding with synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. Given
that microglial cells are generated in the periphery, we hypothesized that microglial cells are an important
component of the human brain development and most likely the first brain cell type to be exposed and respond
to an environmental factor/toxin that can potentially contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders prenatally.
 Here, we will investigate the impact of maternal inflammation due to bacterial or viral infections on human
microglial cells and how that can impact the human developing brain. In addition, given that a person could be
exposed to more toxic factors simultaneously or sequentially during that individual’s lifespan or during pregnancy,
we will also aim to closely replicate the human experience, by testing the impact of co-exposures to infectious
agents and study their synergistic impact on human microglial function and human neurodevelopment.
Current studies using iPSCs has been limited sample size and the lack of diversity in the samples that
are often derived from donors from a single race/ethnical group. Thus, to have a more inclusive approach, in this
proposal, we will use a large cohort of samples from healthy individuals (>50), representative of different races,
ethnicities and genders closely mimicking the proportions found in the United States’ population that will provide
a better understanding of the health disparities and interventions both in populations and in specific subgroups.
Ultimately, our goal is to provide a better understanding of the disease mechanisms involved in maternal
inflammation and better targeted therapies from which the majority of the population in the US could benefit from."

 Mapping the gene-regulatory chromatin interactions within topologically associated domains (sub-
TAD) remains a major challenge in 3D genome research. It is generally believed that multibillion-read
sequencing depth are required for Hi-C analysis at kilobase-resolution due to the complex bias structure
and severe data sparsity. However, we recently discovered that this is problem can be largely solved
computationally without the need for ultradeep-sequencing. We developed a new pipeline named
DeepLoop that can robustly identify high-resolution chromatin interactions from low-depth Hi-C data. The
conceptual innovation of DeepLoop is to handle systematic biases and random noises separately: we
used HiCorr to improve the rigor of bias correction, and then applied deep-learning techniques for noise
reduction and loop signal enhancement. Preliminary results showed that DeepLoop significantly improves
the sensitivity, robustness, and quantitation of Hi-C loop analyses, and can be used to reanalyze most
published low-depth Hi-C datasets. Remarkably, DeepLoop can identify chromatin loops with Hi-C data
from a few dozen single cells. These successes motivate us to further optimize, benchmark, simplify and
upgrade DeepLoop into a versatile tool for the 3D genome field. Aim 1 will optimize and benchmark
DeepLoop performance, improve its compatibility with a variety of different Hi-C protocols, and expand
its utility to ultra-resolution analysis. Aim 2 will develop new DeepLoop-based pipelines to enable robust
mapping of dynamic chromatin loops at high-resolution, including the identification of homolog-specific
loops and loops affected by structure variants. Aim 3 will develop a full-package solution for high-
resolution loop analysis of complex tissues with single cell Hi-C, a significant amount of data will be
generated in this project as a resource for the scientific community."

Global environmental health is recognized as the most pressing challenge of our time. A recent report by The
Lancet estimated that environmental pollution causes three times more deaths from non-communicable
diseases (NCD) than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and that 92% of pollution-related deaths and
diseases occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The mission of the Mount Sinai Division of
International Health is to collaborate with LMICs to identify, document, prevent and mitigate environmental
health problems especially in vulnerable populations such as children and underserved communities. Because
of the close, long-term collaborations established through previous NIH-funded programs, we are poised to
collaborate with new partners in Latin America. Based on those experiences, we propose to employ a proven,
multi-tiered research training strategy that builds on local strengths at the individual, institutional, and regional
levels with public university partners in Costa Rica, a country of many environmental strengths and challenges.
The Mount Sinai-Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica (UNA) partnership is centered on equality and builds on
each partner’s strengths. Our aims are: 1)To create a Mentored Research Scholarship Program in which
junior scientists will be paired with mentors in the US for training in research methods and to conduct long-term
research projects in Costa Rica. 2) To enhance teaching in Environmental and Occupational Health by
collaborating in the creation of short-term courses that enhance research capacity for a broad range of
biomedical and health professionals. 3) To promote South-to-South-to-North Collaboration by supporting a
program of Advanced Research Scholarships to Costa Rican scientists that have a high potential to be self-
sustaining. This multi-level approach to capacity building at the individual, institutional, and regional levels will
ensure that the proposed program has both depth and breadth. The guiding principle of this program plan is to
recognize the strengths of each partner and build on these through mutual collaboration. The program will,
therefore, increase the likelihood of continued long-term impact. In line with our mission, the centerpiece will be
a mentoring program uniquely designed to avoid the “brain-drain” of researchers from the partner country and
instead builds capacity within Latin America. We expect that the program will result in 30 highly-skilled
professionals in environmental health sciences conducting research at local public universities. Their projects
will include multinational collaborations and the enhancement of environmental health resources for
researchers in Costa Rica. We estimate based on our previous research training programs that the mentored
and advanced research projects will generate at least 60 research publications. There will also be an
estimated 250 participants in courses who will be able to incorporate environmental and occupational health
research into their own projects. Importantly, there will also be many local communities and workers who will
benefit from interventions to reduce NCDs caused or aggravated by environmental exposures."
10842269,"The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated
psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation,
affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent
psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent
course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve
predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes
beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets
with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address
these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies:

the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad,
comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple
data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be
rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are
powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced
clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large
studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies,
including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported
U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR
outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR
datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research
community through the NIMH Data Archive."

10843047,"ABSTRACT – DUKE IMMUNE PROFILING CORE SHARED RESOURCE
 The Duke Immune Profiling Core (DIPC) was a developing Shared Resource and is being submitted as a
new Duke Cancer Institute – CCSG Shared Resource. The overarching mission for the DCI is to impact the
existing “standard of medical care” with respect to cancer treatment by working to identify immunologic signatures
that predict clinical outcomes.
 The DIPC shared resource is comprised of 2 components. The first is a Service component in which DIPC
provides comprehensive, highly standardized, state-of-the-art human immunologic profiling services in support
of both intra- and extra-mural translational research endeavors, including Phase I/II clinical trials. The second
DIPC component focuses on Discovery, and utilizes advanced, high dimensional Core technologies and
resources to stimulate innovative translational research initiatives that will impact the existing ‘standard of
medical care.’ With over 28 years of experience in flow cytometry and immune profiling, we are available to
support a wide range of studies from small-scale projects for generating pilot data through to clinical trial testing.
Additionally, our services include study design, performance of experiments, data collection and analysis, and
writing support. Moving forward, we will further enhance our data acquisition and analytical capacity in order to
provide DCI members with innovative methods to evaluate patient specimens.
 In 2018, the DIPC shared resource, which has been in existence for 18 months, provided services to 36
investigators, 56% of whom were DCI members, accounting for 65% of total usage, from 7 of the 8 DCI Research
Programs. Use of this Shared Resource by DCI members, contributed to 20 publications over the project period,
6 of which were in high impact journals."

Advanced training in environmental health and data science: molecules to populations. This application
represents the consolidation of three NIEHS T32 training grants at Columbia University into a unified training
program designed to address critical needs in the field of environmental health sciences. We propose a
program with 18 predoctoral students and 8 postdoctoral scholars. Our mentoring team has substantial funding
from NIEHS (>$13,000,000 per year) and other agencies (>$40,000,0000 per year) that provides a wealth of
opportunities for original research by both pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Our predoctoral trainees will
participate in: 1) a core curriculum in environmental health sciences (using a life course approach to study
molecular mechanisms of disease, epidemiologic methods, health effects of climate change, and the
exposome) 2) a core curriculum in data sciences, 3) specialized coursework to support dissertation research,
4) research rotations, 5) small interdisciplinary training groups, and 6) dissertation research. Although our
trainees will continue to take traditional didactic coursework, the addition of small interdisciplinary training
groups, workshops, and boot camps creates a facile platform that can rapidly evolve to enable student
exposure to cutting-edge methods that address future needs in the field. Through a collaboration with the
Columbia University Data Science Institute (DSI) we propose a highly innovative training program for our
postdoctoral trainees. One of the leading data science programs in the world, the Columbia DSI will provide
complementary training and support for our fellows, including participation in their existing data science
postdoctoral fellows program based in computer science and engineering. Fellows will acquire advanced data
science skills to complement their environmental health science research (the primary focus on their training).
In their second year, these fellows will enhance their leadership skills by facilitating our workshops, bootcamps,
and mini-courses (machine learning, data visualization, network science) for the predoctoral trainees. Thus, the
postdoctoral trainees will acquire a skillset that prepares them to apply advanced data science approaches to
environmental health in the laboratory and in the classroom. Moreover, each postdoctoral fellow will lead (with
an assigned faculty mentor) a small interdisciplinary training group of predoctoral trainees, providing an
ongoing forum for interaction and collaboration between the pre- and postdoctoral trainees and enhancing their
skills in guiding team science."

10847157,"Project Abstract
In 1988 the Mayo Clinic training programs in Endocrinology (DK07147 funded in 1968) and Diabetes and
Metabolism (DK07352 funded in 1979) were merged to create this Training Program in Diabetes and
Metabolism (DK07352). This program supports postdoctoral research training in Endocrinology, Diabetes and
Metabolism for individuals with MD, MD,Phd, or PhD degrees. Our goal is to prepare trainees for academic
careers with the ability to conduct research as independent investigators. The Program supports up to three
years of laboratory research training. The faculty consist of 20 investigators funded with NIH R01 grants and/or
other funds, 4 of whom are junior faculty members in the process of developing independent programs and
mentoring skills. We work with adjunct faculty in both basic science and clinical departments. The Program is
provides trainees with: (i) intense, in-depth education regarding all components of the scientific method, (ii) a
specific project to gain a focused approach to scientific investigation, (iii) experience with state-of-the-art
analytical tools and methodologies, (iv) grant writing abilities, and (v) the skills needed to become independent
biomedical research scientists. We provide access to formal didactic course work (including classes on grant
writing and participation in mock study sections), the opportunity to attend intra- and extra-mural seminars,
conferences and scientific presentations related to their area of study. These opportunities are in the context of
a focused research experience in the laboratories of established investigators. The Program is administered by
the Steering Committee and chaired by the Program Director, with advice from an External Advisory
Committee. The Steering Committee is responsible for interviewing and selecting trainees, as well as assuring
they have an appropriate laboratory assignment and didactic curricula. They review the trainees' initial project,
and assist with the annual review of the trainees' progress.
We are committed to maintaining a focused approach to well-defined training goals for each laboratory-based
trainee with sufficient dedicated research time to assure an optimal educational experience. Our full facutly are
very successful in obtaining extramural funding as we would expect of independent investigators that serve as
primary faculty. We believe our training record is exceptional and that it has been enhanced by our enthusiastic
and knowledgeable junior training faculty. We can also point to support from adjunct faculty whose primary
areas of basic science and/or clinical investigation are intimately tied to those of metabolism, diabetes and
endocrinology. The breadth of the faculty's research programs is notable; ranging from molecular
endocrinology to clinical research. Because our program continues to be highly sought after, because of the
success of our trainees, and because the large amount of research funds awarded to our highly qualified
faculty, we propose to continue our program at the current level of 6 fellowship slots."
10847865,"ABSTRACT
This is a fourth competing renewal of the Clinical and Translational Cancer Control Research Training Program
(CCRTP) led by Drs. Michelle Janelsins, Luke Peppone, and Gary Morrow of the University of Rochester (UR)
and Wilmot Cancer Institute (WCI). The primary aim of the 2- to 3-year CCRTP is to provide PhD and MD
trainees with the tools and experiences necessary to establish careers as outstanding independent
investigators in cancer control research. This program fills an unmet need to train the next generation of cancer
control investigators. As improvements in cancer treatments increase survival rates, there are 20 million cancer
survivors; these survivors continue to experience ongoing side effects that negatively impact quality of life.
Thus, there is a greater need to better understand the numerous debilitating side effects of cancer treatment
and develop interventions. The program combines didactic and “hands-on” research training activities. We
focus on four core training areas (i.e., clinical trials, translational science, health equity, and biostatistics), along
with specialty training areas in psychological interventions, exercise oncology, geriatric oncology, and nutrition.
Dr. Peppone, a former graduate of the CCRTP, formally joins Drs. Janelsins and Morrow as MPI to enhance
the nutritional and natural product component of the CCRTP, providing synergy with Drs. Janelsins and
Morrow’s expertise in clinical trials. For example, a number of recent trainees have focused on interventions
such as Mediterranean diet, time-restricted eating, and fucoidan supplementation to alleviate side effects. Drs.
Janelsins, Peppone, and Morrow are joined by 20 multidisciplinary, outstanding, experienced R01-funded
mentors and 5 junior co-mentors with NCI K Awards from 10 academic departments, and exceptional
infrastructure support from the NCI-funded Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research
Base, the UR Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI), among others, as well as unparalleled
institutional support to conduct and publish independent analyses and develop their own independent clinical
and translational research projects. These research experiences are complemented by completion of a Master
(MS or MPH) degree focused in clinical investigation, epidemiology, translational research, health services, or
data science. For our last 5 classes, 78 applicants (44 males/34 females, 39 minority) have been evaluated; 12
were invited for on-site interviews, including 5 minority applicants; all accepted and matriculated. They have
produced 143 unique manuscripts, obtained several outstanding research awards, and earned K-level
research funding and tenure-track faculty positions. Throughout our history, we have recruited approximately
60% women and 33% minority trainees. A majority (90%) of our trainees are still in academic cancer research
careers at Assistant (9), Associate (24), and Full (5) Professor level; many are now leaders or directors of
major programs within cancer centers. Our next renewal will continue to build upon this momentum with new
innovations and retaining pearls of success with our ultimate goal of improving the lives of patients with cancer."
10847918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The premise of this proposal is that training the next generation of vision scientists in translation of basic science
research to clinical and public health interventions will be critical toward advancing the field. Basic scientific and
technological advances are occurring at an unprecedented pace. However, ophthalmologists often lack the
background to understand how recent basic and clinical research findings may be applied to their practices, and
basic scientists often lack adequate perspective to identify gaps in clinical knowledge to guide their research.
This application proposes to renew a successful T32 translational vision research training program for students
in pre-doctoral training programs in basic or applied science, or postdoctoral fellows at the Casey Eye Institute,
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The overall goal is to prepare individuals for successful academic
careers in vision science research through didactic education and intensive mentored research experience in a
multidisciplinary environment. The vision research and training environment at OHSU is highly collaborative and
interdisciplinary, with strong programmatic support in translation of research from bench to bedside in areas such
as gene therapy, molecular genetics, clinical trials, ophthalmic imaging, and biomedical informatics. The
university has top educational programs in clinical ophthalmology and basic visual science, and is consistently
ranked in the top 10 nationally in NEI-supported research. This T32 program fills an important gap in education
because OHSU is one of the few major academic medical centers in the Pacific Northwest, yet there are no other
programs to support didactic training in visual science research here. We will continue to leverage the existing
infrastructure at OHSU to allow more pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to benefit from and contribute
toward this research and educational environment. Since 2013, we have supported 21 trainees (including 3
under-represented groups, two first-generation college graduates and 4 women) who have published 88 peer-
reviewed papers (27 as 1st author) with their mentors in leading journals. All but one of our past trainees have
remained in science related careers, with the majority staying in vision research. Specifically, we propose to
continue this T32 program for 2 pre-doctoral and 1 post-doctoral trainee, which will be integrated with ongoing
research and existing OHSU graduate programs. Training consists of six key components: (1) research projects
with mentors and collaborators; (2) a didactic course covering fundamentals of basic, clinical, and translational
vision science; (3) monthly vision research seminars for discussion of ongoing research by trainees and faculty;
(4) institution-wide education and career development activities; (5) a grant mentorship program to teach and
support trainees as they apply for their own, independent funding; and (6) training in responsible conduct of
research. This T32 program continues to provide a clinical perspective to trainees with existing backgrounds in
basic science. OHSU is a setting where rigorous training through this T32 program will provide a generation of
young researchers with the tools to optimize translational vision research."
10850347,"The mission of the National Resource for Aplysia at the University of Miami (the Resource) is to produce and
distribute consistently high-quality cultured sea hares, Aplysia californica, for biomedical research and
education and to improve the usefulness of this model system by applied research. Aplysia has played a vital
role in fundamental discoveries of how cellular and molecular changes in the nervous system underlie basic
behaviors, learning, and memory, due to unique characteristics of the simple nervous system that provide an
ideal model system for such studies. The 3 aims of the proposed continuation of this Resource program are:
 1. Animal Culture, Distribution and Health Monitoring – The Resource will continue to culture A.
californica and make all life stages, from eggs to large adults, available to researchers at a reasonable cost.
We anticipate sales will continue at a level of 8,000-10,000 animals per year. We will also accommodate
requests by users for separately reared cohorts, specialized diets, or harvesting of specific tissues for RNA or
DNA. We will monitor naturally occurring Aplysia abyssovirus (AAbV) in cohorts to better understand the
potential impacts of this virus and to provide information about virus levels to users. In addition, we will make
available additional specialized animals as developed in our Applied Research programs.
 2. Curation and Informatics – An improved system for management of stocks from egg laying throughout
the lifespan will be created and made publicly available through a web interface. The established website will
be enhanced to include additional content on uses of the Aplysia model system for human health research and
teaching. Our online ordering system will be improved. Training opportunities for graduate students,
undergraduate teaching labs, and public outreach activities using Aplysia will be expanded and enhanced.
 3. Applied Research – We will conduct two applied research projects that will expand the usefulness of this
model system. 3.1 Developing Aplysia as a model of enhanced susceptibility of the aged to cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) – Aplysia is hypoxia-resistant, and likely has adaptations to resist IRI. Markers
of IRI, such as variations in mitochondrial function, will be studied in abdominal ganglia exposed to ischemia
and ischemia plus reperfusion. We will also examine the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI.
Developing this model may allow users to investigate the impacts of IRI on neural excitability and may lead to
novel avenues of research and innovation in therapies. 3.2 Developing Aplysia as a model to study enhanced
susceptibility of the aged to myocardial IRI – Impacts of IRI on cardiac function as well as other IRI markers will
be studied. As above, the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI will be investigated. This aim will
begin to pinpoint what adaptations Aplysia heart employs to mitigate hypoxic damage, and if those adaptations
persist as an organism ages. Developing Aplysia as a cardiac model will potentially expand this model
organism to uses beyond the nervous system."

10862874,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-based immunotherapies have shown great success in the treatment of
patients with several different cancer types. CTLs recognize peptide antigens presented at the tumor cell
surface by HLA class I molecules, triggering specific tumor cell lysis. Defining the nature of such tumor-
associated antigens (TAAs) can directly facilitate therapeutic tumor targeting through a number of
interventions, including personalized vaccines, endogenous T cell infusion, or TCR-engineered
immunotherapies. However, only a minority of human TAAs can be confidently identified using conventional
proteomic methodologies. Recent evidence suggests this may be due to the fact that most of the
immunopeptidome is comprised of peptides derived from ‘non-canonical’ sources such as those derived
from translated introns, RNA editing, proteasome splicing, or containing post-translational modifications.
Although these represent potentially high value tumor targets, few of these have yet been validated as bona
fide TAAs. However, overcoming the challenges inherent in non-canonical TAA identification holds the
promise of significantly expanding the landscape of targetable antigens for cancer patients.
 The specific objective of this project is to identify and assess non-canonical TAAs as potential
therapeutic targets for melanoma, as a necessary prerequisite and foundation for generating effective CTL-
based immunotherapies for treating patients with this disease. It is our central hypothesis that unique, non-
canonical TAAs can constitute shared immunotherapeutic CTL targets, and that those TAAs induced
downstream of oncogenic driver mutations such as BRAF(V600E) will show greater tumor specificity and
refractoriness to antigen loss. We have formulated this hypothesis based on preliminary data showing that
potentially targetable non-canonical TAA peptides can be identified using an integration of highly sensitive
mass spectrometry (MS) combined with genetic sequencing analysis and a novel, in-house bioinformatics
pipeline. We have also shown that constitutive oncogenic MAPK pathway activation leads to dramatic global
tumor immunopeptidome shifts that appear to potentially involve thousands of non-canonical TAAs. There is
a strong clinical rationale for this antigen discovery work since it will directly facilitate the development of
novel, CTL-based therapies with the potential to benefit large numbers of cancer patients.
 The proposed work is innovative, because it will explore different categories of non-canonical TAAs
in cancer and assess their immunogenicity and potential therapeutic value as shared cancer targets. It will
also shed light on the transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur upon oncogenic-mediated MAPK
pathway activation, and how this influences the tumor immunopeptidome. Lastly, fulfilling the outlined
objectives will have an important positive clinical impact, because they will facilitate development of the next
generation of novel antigen-specific CTL-based immunotherapies for melanoma patients, and possibly also
patients with other cancer types."
10863336,"Project Summary/Abstract – Overall: The UCI Vaccines for Pandemic Preparedness Center (VPPC)
 The Mission: ""To contribute to human health and well-being by developing agile, safe, effective and
accessible vaccines that protect the vulnerable against future pathogens of pandemic importance and by
educating the next generation of vaccine scientists that will tackle such challenges.”
 Joshua Lederberg envisioned the world as a battlefield between microbes and man, famously saying, “The
future of humanity and microbes likely will unfold as episodes of a suspense thriller that could be titled Our Wits
Versus Their Genes” (Lederberg, 2000). Although the genes of the microbial world have been evolving much
longer than our wits, we have come up with efficient ways to respond to infectious diseases, but regrettably
evolving microorganisms keep managing to challenge and outsmart us.
 The latest COVID episode in this series sensitized the world again to the importance of learning from the
outbreak experience and challenges us to better prepare for the next one. The 100 Days Mission (100DM),
endorsed by government and non-government organizations worldwide is a proposed response to the next
“Disease X” by making safe, and effective vaccines available within 100 days of the pathogen’s identification.
Achieving that goal could defuse the threat of a pathogen with pandemic potential.
 The International Pandemic Preparedness Secretariate (IPPS), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (CEPI), the HHS Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR Next) and the
NIH/NIAID have embraced the concept of studying prototype pathogens as a critical element of preparedness.
By developing vaccines on rapid-response platforms against examples of a given viral genus or family,
researchers can address scientific challenges characteristic of that family in advance, providing an important
head start on developing vaccines against related threats. Universal programmable vaccine platforms that can
be rapidly employed against broad virus families can be evaluated in clinical trials to provide confidence in their
safety, and manufacturing, and regulatory considerations can be managed ahead of the next outbreak.
 The UC Irvine Vaccines for Pandemic Preparedness Center (VPPC) aims to conduct basic and translational
research to develop vaccines against prototype members of the Bunyavirus, Paramyxovirus and Picornavirus
families with demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy in animal models. Two universal, programmable, rapid
response vaccine platforms will be characterized and compared in this study: the i) Adjuvanted Recombinant
Protein (ARP) Vaccine, and ii) mRNA/Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Vaccine. Such prototype vaccines will need to
be tested in advance, at a minimum, for clinical safety and immunogenicity, and efficacy where possible, so that
emerging viruses in the same family can be rapidly and safely deployed. Gathering such data and experience
will build confidence in these rapid response platforms and inform regulators as they make decisions about the
emergency authorization of vaccines against related pathogens."
10860579,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no effective treatments. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
has three major polymorphic alleles, denoted ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Homozygosity for ApoE4 is the
strongest genetic risk factor for AD with an astonishing 12-fold increased risk of developing AD compared
with individuals who inherit ApoE3.1,2 ApoE4 differs from ApoE3 by a single amino acid, an arginine instead of
cysteine at position 112. This small change presumably alters the conformation of the protein, altering its
activity in many biological pathways resulting in both gain and loss of function.1,3 Given the dramatic impact of
ApoE4 on AD biology (including increased amyloid deposition, faster rate of progression, decreased synaptic
content), there have been attempts to identify a small molecule that binds to ApoE4 and makes it functionally
similar to ApoE3, a so called “corrector”. Yet this has been challenging: Generating purified ApoE4 protein has
proven to be difficult, as the protein is notoriously sticky and readily aggregates. Multiple mutations in the C-
terminal region are required to enable ApoE purification and structural determination.4 We and others have
shown that analysis of such purified protein in a Protein Thermal Shift assay (PTS) shows that ApoE4 is >4oC
less thermally stable than ApoE3.5 We have extended this finding by now demonstrating that lysates from the
brains of humans or humanized ApoE transgenic animals when analyzed by an analogous technique, a
CEllular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA)6 also show that brain ApoE4 is less thermally stable compared to
ApoE3. As CETSA is a low throughput assay, we engineered a HiBiT tag on to the N-terminus of ApoE to
derive a split Nano-luciferase HiBiT cellular thermal Shift Assay (BiTSA)7,8 in HEK 293 cells, and miniaturized
this assay to a 384 well format. Excitingly, we show that the thermal stability of ApoE4 measured by BiTSA can
be “corrected” to that of ApoE3 by a recently published ApoE4 corrector (compound 8, EC50 <3uM) 9),
discovered by scientists at AbbVie and a previously published genetic “corrector” – the Arg61T mutation. We
have synthesized 30 analogs of compound 8 in a Hit to Lead effort and demonstrate nascent SAR and
potential paths forward to optimize this series for in vivo use. Our research plan has three aims: 1) identify
new ApoE4 corrector by screening 250,000 compounds deploying the ApoE4 PTS assay as a primary
assay and the ApoE4 BiTSA as a secondary assay 2) drive medicinal chemistry optimization of
compound 8 and hits identified in the HTP screen and 3) test the hypothesis that these correctors can
ameliorate ApoE4 related Alzheimer phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo using cell and murine models
that we and others have developed. These efforts represent initial steps towards our overall long-term
objective, discovering first in class ApoE4 correctors as therapeutics for AD."

research. We will integrate genomics-focused ethics into the annual 1-month long Vanderbilt Institute for
Research Development and Ethics (VIRDE) faculty enrichment program at VUMC, benefiting 8 Nigerian
researchers over a 5-year period. We will also host an annual 3-week practicum at VUMC’s Center for
Biomedical Ethics and Society for 12 Nigerian Institutional Review Board (IRB) members to strengthen their
skills in protocol review and administration. We will offer annual 5-day research ethics workshops for IRB and
Community Advisory Board members at AKTH in Nigeria on protection of human subjects in research, ethics of
genetic and genomic research, and review of genomic research protocols (~150 trainees in total). To sustain
and expand the impact of the V-NET program, we will: 1) create, curate, and distribute a curricular toolkit in
ethics of genetic and genomic research tailored to Nigerians and other African IRB members and research
ethics educators, and 2) coordinate 16 quarterly online research ethics webinars presented by global ethics
experts to African researchers. Through V-NET, a skilled cohort of Nigerian academics, researchers, and
healthcare professionals will emerge, providing leadership in the ethical design and review of genetic and
genomic studies in Nigeria's rapidly evolving research landscape."
10859331,"ABSTRACT:
Extracellular vesicle (EV) generation and release is investigated as a default waste removal mechanism, a
source of potential biomarkers, for transport of material between cells, and for propagation of pathology
throughout the brain. EVs are highly heterogenous, and each EV subtype contributes to brain physiology and
disease differently. Our laboratory has developed a technique to fractionate EV subtypes from murine and human
brain tissue, identifying a previously unknown subtype of brain EVs of mitochondrial origin, named mitovesicles.
Given the novelty, mitovesicle biology and function(s) have never been investigated. We hypothesize that
mitovesicle secretion into the brain extracellular space eliminates detrimental mitochondrial materials from the
cell, especially when other mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, including mitophagy, are disrupted.
Shuttling from one cell to another, dysfunctional mitovesicles can transfer this mitochondrial content from a single
focal site to the rest of the brain, potentially impairing recipient distal cells. We will test our novel hypotheses
regarding cellular mechanisms involving mitovesicles in the brain, both physiological and pathological, ideas that
are supported by our preliminary findings and are consistent with mitochondria being a point of heightened
vulnerability in Alzheimer disease (AD). We propose in vitro and in vivo studies of all aspects of mitovesicle
lifecycle, including generation, secretion, uptake, and intracellular fate in recipient cells. Furthermore, we will
explore whether mitovesicles isolated from brains of murine models of b-amyloidosis trigger alterations in
otherwise normal tissues that are reminiscent of AD, including changes in mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy,
reactive oxygen species production, oxidative balance, cell survival, neuroinflammation, and synaptic
transmission, leading to behavioral deficits. Our proposed studies will examine the mechanism initiating changes
in mitovesicles biogenesis and secretion and the downstream effects of these changes. We will study
mitovesicles isolated from the brain of two AD-relevant mouse models of b-amyloidosis, the knock-in APPNL-F/NL-
F and the overexpressing APP23, that preliminary studies have shown to be altered prior to robust b-amyloidosis.
The effect of sex, age, and amyloid b deposition will be considered by analyzing brains of female and male mice
at different ages, comparing a prodromal stage, an age with limited plaque pathology, and an advanced
pathology stage age with extensive b-amyloidosis. In Aim 1 we will investigate mitovesicle biology, including
intracellular biogenesis, transport, release, and uptake of physiological mitovesicles in cultured neurons,
astrocytes, and microglia. In Aim 2 we will investigate the pathogenic changes in mitovesicles in the two b-
amyloidosis mouse models. Findings will be confirmed in mitovesicles isolated from the brain of AD patients, as
compared with non-demented controls. The proposed experiments will determine the balance of beneficial and
pathogenic effects of mitovesicles and have the potential to identify previously unexplored therapeutic directions
to restore the integrity of mitochondria, minimizing the neurodegenerative consequences of AD."

The overarching goal of the proposal is to determine the structural basis for allosteric mechanisms governing
gating and modulation in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC). The pLGIC superfamily governs crucial
physiological processes such as gastrointestinal functions, motor functions, and pain transmission. Aberrant
channel functions are implicated in mood disorders, addiction, chronic pain, and cancer. Currently used
therapeutic strategies suffer from our limited knowledge of the molecular details of pLGIC function, the origin of
their functional diversity, and the downstream signaling events. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we recently
solved structures of the full-length serotonin receptor (5HT3AR), a cationic pLGIC, in the resting state and two
serotonin-activated conformations. Building on this technical advancement and further biochemical
optimization, we aim to determine the conformational changes underlying gating and lipid modulation in the full-
length homomeric and heteromeric receptors within the cationic 5-HT3R and anionic glycine receptor (GlyR)
subfamilies. To achieve these goals we will use an approach that combines multidisciplinary techniques,
including cryo-EM, pulsed-EPR, and electrophysiology. Specifically, we will determine high-resolution
snapshots of pLGIC in multiple functional states, in modulator-bound conformations, in the presence of
membrane lipid constituents, and in complex with intracellular-binding proteins. These structures will be
validated and complemented with protein dynamic studies in a membrane environment and extensive functional
analysis. Taken together, our proposed work is expected to provide molecular blueprints of the channel in
physiologically relevant conformations for therapeutic targeting and unravel the molecular mechanisms
underlying channel function. These findings will, in turn, pave the way for design of novel therapeutic agents
that are safer and more effective."
10839403,"ABSTRACT
Diffusible signal factors (DSFs), long-chain fatty acids with a characteristic cis-2 unsaturation, are produced
and used by several genera of gram-negative bacteria as quorum-sensing signals. We have found that the
DSF cis-2 hexadecenoic acid (c2-HDA) is extremely potent in inhibiting expression of Salmonella functions
necessary for colonization of the intestine and have found this compound to be present in the murine large
intestine. As no mammalian source of fatty acids harboring a 2-cis unsaturation has been described, these
findings strongly suggest that constituents of the gut microbiota produce and excrete DSFs that inhibit
Salmonella virulence. We hypothesize that Salmonella uses the signals of these bacteria to balance its
virulence functions, essential but also costly to the fitness and survival of the invading bacteria, with
colonization and proliferation of the Salmonella population. Gut microbial metabolites may therefore serve
multiple coordinated purposes in pathogens, balancing virulence functions with those required for proliferation
within a host and thus affecting pathogen survival in the gut by multiple means. Here we propose to: Aim 1:
Use complementary approaches to identify bacteria of the human gut microbiome that produce inhibitory DSFs
and characterize their products; Aim 2: Identify the constellation of functions regulated in Salmonella by DSFs
and identify mechanisms of this control, and; Aim 3: Using established murine models of Salmonella infection,
characterize the biological function and translational relevance of c2-HDA to understand its mechanism of
action and to support the eventual development of novel therapeutics, such as live biotherapeutic products, for
the control of human salmonellosis."
10852054,"Project Summary – Overall
The advent of genomic sequencing technologies has revolutionized our understanding of disease transmission,
pathogen evolution, drug resistance, and virulence. Pathogens can quickly adapt to new environments and
treatments, making it critical to understand the underlying genetic changes that drive this process. The proposed
Michigan Infectious Disease Genomics (MIDGE) Center will feature four projects, each focused on a group of
pathogens, unified by a common theme of identifying pathogen determinants of epidemic success and by a
common approach that combines genomic surveillance, functional genomics, and high-throughput phenotyping
assays. Project 1 examines the genomic determinants of epidemic success in SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza
viruses. Here, epidemic success is linked to the virus’s ability to transmit and spread within an immune population
through mutations that either increase intrinsic transmissibility or allow for escape from neutralizing antibodies.
Project 2 investigates the impact of genetic background on the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriales, where epidemic success is linked not only to drug resistance genes and mutations but also
to the genetic background on which they arise. Project 3 will define genetic and genomic determinants of
colonization in Candida auris, an emerging fungal pathogen. The key to the epidemic success of C. auris appears
to be its remarkable ability to adhere to and colonize the skin and the built environment, and this project will
leverage whole genome sequencing, microbial GWAS, and functional genomic screens to identify the genetic
circuitry for this trait. Project 4 uses functional genomic approaches to understand the virulence of epidemic
strains of Toxoplasma gondii, which are more common in South America and cause a distinct disease from that
associated with other globally dispersed lineages. Genomic surveillance of scat from wild cats will be used to
further define the diversity of potentially epidemic, hypervirulent strains in this region. A Technical and Data Core
will support the work of all four projects with staff bioinformaticians and research data analysts as well as
Investigators with expertise in phylogenetics, high-throughput phenotyping assays, and analysis of complex data
sets. The Administrative Core will leverage local strengths in training and outreach and provide an infrastructure
for regulatory compliance, financial reporting, and data and resource sharing. Through successful execution of
this research plan, the MIDGE Center will develop genomic methods and protocols to study infectious diseases
and will advance genomics more broadly in basic and clinical research across viral, bacterial, fungal, and
parasitic pathogens."
10851692,"Project Summary / Abstract
Children learn words by connecting the language input they perceive to the objects and events in the world
around them. While hearing children perceive auditory linguistic input while simultaneously looking at objects,
deaf children learning sign language perceive both linguistic input and objects visually. Therefore, deaf children
must learn to strategically and swiftly allocate their visual attention to map language onto its referents. This
learning process is complicated by the fact that deaf children frequently have incomplete access to language:
despite gains in technology and interventions, spoken language is generally not fully accessible to deaf
children, and most deaf children are born to hearing parents who lack expertise in sign language. Together,
these factors place young deaf children at risk for significant delay in development of a full first language,
which has cascading consequences on later language, literacy, and academic outcomes. Thus it is critical to
identify how input and interactions with young deaf children can optimally support early language development.
The proposed project investigates word learning in deaf children learning American Sign Language (ASL), a
significant and growing subset of the deaf population. Word learning is a critical component of language
acquisition that enables children to map object and event labels with the surrounding world. The specific aims
of this proposal are to 1) define the temporal alignment of parent input and children’s attention that supports
word learning in deaf children; 2) identify the role of children’s dynamically shifting visual attention in word
learning; and 3) demonstrate how linguistic and referential cues support word learning. This project uses a
combination of naturalistic observations of parent-child interaction and behavioral and eye-tracking
experiments in which the timing of input and the combination of input cues are manipulated to determine which
contexts are most supportive of word learning in ASL. This project has broad theoretical implications. Current
accounts of joint attention are based almost entirely on spoken language interactions, but language input and
attention must be organized and timed differently when both language and attention are perceived in a single
modality. The proposed project will lead to an expanded, unified theoretical account of joint attention that
encompass word learning across modalities. This project also has direct translational implications for parents,
early intervention professionals, and teachers of deaf children. First, the proposed work seeks to identify
developmental benchmarks in children’s visual attention that support word learning, and these benchmarks
can serve diagnostic tools in evaluation. Seond, understanding the optimal input timing and cues that support
word learning can inform approaches to intervention for families with deaf children. The current project focuses
on deaf children acquiring ASL, yet the findings will be broadly applicable, in that visual cues provide critical
information for deaf children learning language across modalities."
10851693,"The detection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), precancerous lesions of the pancreas, is
rising due to the increasing use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. These cystic neoplasms have been
shown to evolve from low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma and are believed to
account for 20-30% of all pancreatic cancers. The management of patients with some forms of IPMN remains
controversial because current technologies are unable to reliably distinguish between low and high risk IPMN.
There is therefore a need to develop better tools to facilitate the management of controversial lesions. The goal
of this proposal is to develop and test an ultra-sensitive DEST method for profiling circulating extracellular vesicles
(EV) shed by high risk IPMN. Specifically, we propose to i) develop and validate new marker sets relevant for IPMN
progression at unprecedented sensitivities (aim 1) and ii) expand and rigorously test the approach for point-of-care
analyses in prospectively collected clinical samples (aim 2). We hypothesize that highly sensitive EV analysis will
shed valuable light on biomarker composition in IPMN, a necessary prerequisite to identify high risk lesions and
early PDAC. The proposed DEST method has the potential to transform IPMN/early PDAC cancer research and
clinical practice."
10838450,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing in prevalence in the United States and despite efforts to date an effective
treatment remains elusive. AD presents clinically as amyloid plaque load, neurofibrillary tangles comprised of
hyper phosphorylated tau, and abnormal vasculature, but the mechanistic basis for cognitive decline is not
known. We have shown that the anti-aging intervention of caloric restriction (CR) preserves brain volume and
neuronal synaptic density, and lowers age-related astrogliosis. Importantly, age-related shifts in redox
metabolism and mitochondrial energy metabolism in brain are abrogated by CR. Our hypothesis is that
neuroprotection by CR will slow AD pathology development specifically through its impact on brain metabolism.
We will implement CR in APP PS1 (amyloid plaques) and hTauP301 (neurofibrillary tangles) mouse models of
AD to determine the impact of CR-induced changes in brain metabolism on pathology development and the
consequence for cellular networks of neurons, glia, and the vasculature. Experiments include behavioral testing,
ex vivo electrophysiology, and in vivo imaging technology. Brain metabolism will be tracked using histochemistry
and 2-photon metabolic imaging. Additional mechanistic studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches
in primary neurons and astrocytes will determine the impact of metabolism on brain cell-cell networks. There are
three specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of CR on AD pathology advance, documenting hippocampal
dependent memory and behaviors, ex vivo measures of synaptic transmission and hippocampal neuronal
networks, and brain metabolism.
 Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of metabolism and AD pathology on neuron-glial crosstalk using
co-cultured primary neurons and primary astrocytes. Live imaging studies will investigate how neurons with
amyloidopathy and tauopathy respond to changes in astrocyte metabolism in real time.
 Specific Aim 3: To determine the in vivo impact of CR-induced changes in brain metabolism and AD
pathology on vascular responsivity and adaptation using implanted transparent electrodes and opto-genetics
coupled with coherence tomography.
 These studies focus on the interaction between disease pathology and the local brain metabolic
environment, acknowledging the importance of layers of communication among neuronal, neuron-glia, and
vascular networks, and establishing mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effects of CR. The proposed
research will advance our understanding of the role metabolism plays in AD progression, and will determine if
strategies to preserve brain metabolism as a function of age might have therapeutic potential as a means to
ameliorate outcomes of AD, translating basic biology to clinical promise."
10838452,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Free ionized intracellular Mg2+ (iMg2+) is estimated to be in the range of 0.5–1.2 mM. In general, it is accepted
that under resting conditions, the concentration of ionized cytosolic Mg2+ is `muffled' by phosphometabolites,
nucleic acids and proteins. For example, ATP binds with a Kd value of 50 M-70 μM and therefore Mg2+ in the
cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix is primarily complexed with ATP (Mg-ATP2-). Because of its abundance (~5
mM), ATP is considered to be the largest iMg2+ `store'. Fluctuations in free cytosolic (cMg2+) following hormonal
stimuli have been touted as passive adjustments of Mg2+ dissociating from the exuberant Mg-ATP contingent
and other `buffered' pools of Mg2+. Apart from iMg2+ `buffering' mechanism, Mg2+ ion channels and transporters
controlling Mg2+ entry as well as efflux across the plasma membrane are thought to maintain the equilibrium of
free cMg2+. Currently, several candidates are correlated to Mg2+ entry machinery (TRPM6, TRPM7, MagT1), but
are still awaiting convincing biophysical and physiological evidence for such roles. The Mg2+/Na+ exchanger
SLC41A1 was proposed to contribute Mg2+ efflux from the cell, whereas Mrs2 was proposed as a mitochondrial
Mg2+ transporter. Very little is known about the molecular details of Mg2+ transport into/from cellular organelles
like the ER, mitochondria, endosomes and lysosomes. A few studies have speculated that free [Mg2+] in the ER
and mitochondria are likely to be similar to [cMg2+]. However, the temporal and spatial dynamics, let alone the
biological relevance of iMg2+ mobilization, remain a mystery in cell biology. Nevertheless, Mg2+ is an essential
cation controlling many biochemical reactions. Our recent work has shown that L-lactate acts as an activator that
triggers a dynamic transfer of Mg2+ between the ER and mitochondria to shape bioenergetics and cellular
metabolism (Cell 2020). Mechanistically, L-lactate stimulates Mg2+ release from the ER followed by Mg2+ uptake
by mitochondria. The mitochondrial localized Mrs2 transporter was found to be responsible for the accumulation
of Mg2+ in mitochondria. However, the L-lactate-induced ER release molecular machinery remains unidentified.
I propose to identify ER Mg2+ release component, plasma membrane entry machinery and the resultant
molecular signaling pathways. I will take advantage of unbiased RNAi screen and targeted CRISPR/Cas9 editing
approaches to answer these mysteries in the Mg2+ signaling field. Identification of these molecular machineries
would aid in our understanding of iMg2+ dynamics and the cause-effect relationships that exist between iMg2+ flux
and cellular processes. Additionally, I will test and define the Mg2+-dependent signaling events based on the
cellular and mouse model phenotypes. It is thrilling to define the molecular link between cellular Mg2+
homeostasis and physiological function. Our identification and characterization of the Mg2+ flux components will
further investigate how, and if, these signaling routes impinge on the pathophysiology of a growing number of
Mg2+ deficiency diseases in humankind. Overall, the R35/MIRA funding will support the testing of this
unconventional hypothesis and my laboratory will address these major mysteries in the near future."
10838453,"PROJECT SUMMARY | Spatial navigation is fundamental to survival, and entorhinal cortex (EC) function may
be fundamental to forming and remembering cognitive maps. The Nobel Prize-winning discovery that EC
neurons map environments with grid-like signals has given rise to a class of theories that grid-like metrics from
EC facilitate spatial orientation, planning, and navigation to goals. Deficits in these same navigational abilities
are a hallmark of both healthy aging and Alzheimer’s-related dementia (ADRD), and EC dysfunction is one of
the earliest effects of Alzheimer’s disease and is associated with pre-clinical cognitive decline as well. However,
at this time, despite convergent evidence that EC is central to memory and cognitive mapping, how human EC
contributes to spatial memory mechanisms remains largely theoretical, and how grid-like signal declines (that
have been observed in aging and as a pre-clinical biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease in APOE-ε4 carriers) can
contribute to declines in spatial ability in aging and ADRD remains remarkably poorly understood.
 This proposal will leverage several powerful virtual-navigation and fMRI paradigms to address three gaps
in the literature: Aim 1 is to understand how the structure of environments is represented in the human brain.
Extensive psychological evidence demonstrates that environmental barriers fragment and distort people’s
memory and sense of space. Aim 1 will address why - testing strong predictions that EC encodes spatial metrics
that humans use to orient and locate themselves in space, and that barriers shape people’s sense of space in
part by anchoring and shaping the spatial metrics from EC. Aim 2 is to address how spatial signals in EC interact
with the hippocampus, and contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory. It is believed that the hippocampus
builds relational maps of different aspects of our life. The proposed studies will test this, and theories that grid-
like EC signals inform 1) how different parts of our environment are segregated in hippocampal memory, but
also 2) how the hippocampus encodes similarities between navigational experiences. Aim 3 is to test a neural-
mechanistic model of how the hippocampal-EC system contributes to well-known age-related deficits in spatial
cognition. Aim 3 will use a battery of cutting-edge neuroimaging methods and psychological measures. The
researchers will test the hypothesis that navigation deficits can be understood through a functional network-level
perspective of how routes become integrated into map-like memory, how people perceive and update spatial
knowledge, and how individual, age-related differences in such knowledge influence navigational strategies.
 Collectively, this body of work will 1) test fundamental predictions about how space and environmental
structure are encoded in the human brain, and 2) establish a deep mechanism-level understanding of the marked
changes in spatial cognition that occur in aging, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. The insights
from these tests are necessary if researchers hope to explain, predict, or ultimately develop interventions that
could treat the changes in navigation ability that can come with age."
10838557,"American Indians/Alaska Natives [AIAN] and other Indigenous Populations (IP) of the Americas experience
persistent and dire health disparities related to substance abuse and addictions (SAA). Despite such glaring
disparities, there is a paucity of culturally grounded research addressing their biomedical and socio-behavioral
health concerns. A strong network of highly trained Indigenous scholars dedicated to culturally relevant SAA
research would contribute to ameliorating SAA-related health disparities among IP. This new application, in
response to PAR-19-246, “Providing Research Education Experiences to Enhance Diversity in the Next
Generation of Substance Abuse and Addiction Scientists” will develop the INSPIRE: An Indigenous Substance
abuse and addictions Prevention Interdisciplinary Research Education program. INSPIRE will develop a cadre
of culturally grounded AIAN substance abuse and addictions scholars capable of serving as principal
investigators on extramurally funded SAA-related prevention and disparities studies; as well as to develop a
cohort of qualified doctoral and post-doctoral trainees from IP who have been historically underrepresented in
biomedical and socio-behavioral research careers dedicated to furthering their studies or careers in SAA
research with IP. The INSPIRE program is based on the success of our Indigenous Substance abuse and
Medicines Research Training (ISMART) NIDA Contract program (HHSN271201700716P), one of two AIAN-
focused substance abuse and addictions research development programs in the country. INSPIRE will provide
a 24-month substance abuse and addictions research mentoring program to 20 qualified scholars (5 doctoral,
15 postdoctoral/early career) primarily from AIAN and other Indigenous populations (e.g., Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders) who are currently conducting research with AIAN/IP populations. INSPIRE mentees will
undergo a structured, intensive year-round mentorship program that includes: (a) annual research and
writing retreats (including a 5-day Fall Immersion Research Training Institute; a 5-day Spring writing retreat; a
1-day AIAN Substance Abuse Research Summit and grant development workshop at the NIDA AIAN national
meeting or a selected national scientific conference; (b) year-round multidisciplinary learning and research
experience opportunities (4 quarterly webinars/seminars; funding for on-site Mentor shadowing
opportunities; and support for attendance to national NIDA research meetings); (c) technical assistance (peer
review for grant development and submission; statistical, editorial and technical assistance for developing
grant applications and manuscript preparation); (d) seed funding ($22,000 for postdoctoral/early career
scientists and $10,800 for doctoral students to conduct pilot studies, conference travel, and travel to meet with
mentors and mentorship teams); and (e) network development (via mentor networks and website). By the
end of the program, Fellows will have designed and implemented a pilot study, published SAA-related articles;
presented at a SAA-related conference, and developed or submitted a NIH SAA-related grant proposal."
10838567,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The success of vaccination requires the generation of a strong immune response to the
inoculated antigens in order to provide long-term protective immunity against many infectious
diseases. To achieve this goal often requires the addition of vaccine adjuvants, substances that
a substance that boosts the body’s immune response to the vaccine. However, there are only a
few human vaccine adjuvants with an extensive safety record and minimal toxicity approved for
clinical use. At presence, more studies are needed to identify novel adjuvants that not only
significantly enhance the immune response for a particular vaccine, but also must be minimally
toxic and maximally safe for clinical use. In efforts to discover novel vaccine adjuvants, an in
vivo screening of forty-seven saponins from medicinal plants for their immunostimulatory and
hemolytic activities has led to the discovery of new exciting vaccine adjuvants. Among forty-
seven saponins evaluated, soyasaponins have emerged as the most potent adjuvants. These
newly-discovered carbohydrates exhibited a significantly enhanced adjuvant activity with almost
negligible toxicity when directly compared to QS-21 which has emerged as a vaccine adjuvant in
numerous clinical trials. However, obtaining them from natural sources is a complicated process
of extraction and purification that result in the production of minute. As a result, isolation of
soyasaponins is economically unfeasible and unsustainable if sufficient quantities are required
for immunological studies and clinical applications. Since FDA has strict regulations regarding to
the purity and quality of adjuvants for use in human, a synthetic source must be developed for
soyasaponins to be utilized as clinically relevant adjuvants. The objective of this proposal will
address these challenges through the chemical synthesis for procuring sufficient quantities of
soyasaponins in pure form. This effort will deliver well-defined soyasaponins without batch-to-
batch variation and provide tools for studies of their roles as vaccine adjuvants and exploration
of structure-adjuvant potency profiles for the discovery of non-natural soyasaponin improved
adjuvants."
